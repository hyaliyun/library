It was inhabited for tens of thousands of years, by Neanderthals and others. The shaft was filled in with brecciated material in the Late Pleistocene, and was partly excavated by miners in the nineteenth century. In the rubble, fossil remains of humans, including those of Neanderthals, were found in the 1990s, and after excavations in the shaft, in 2006-2007 a skeleton of a young Neanderthal woman was found, possibly buried with her child. Description The cave is in Torre-Pacheco, in the Murcia community of Andalusia. It is a vertical shaft in karst, in the Cabezo Gordo hill, and overlooks Mar Menor, a saltwater lagoon in the Mediterranean. The cave is found under overhanging rock, 123 meters above sea level, and the shaft has a depth of 18 meters. It was filled with brecciated material in the Late Pleistocene, much of which was removed by 19th-century miners who dug a horizontal tunnel toward the shaft, excavated much of it and left the rubble remains on the hillside. The miners were probably looking for water to wash out iron ore for the mining concessions on the hill.) Archeological investigation started when remains of an individual now called Palomas 1 were found in the rubble; someone had abseiled into the shaft and found a fossil in the sediment a few meters down. It turned out to be the jaws of a Neanderthal, still together, and an important enough find to warrant scientific investigation. The researchers soon discovered that much of the shaft had been dug out and the remains dumped on the hillside; the miners had left an entire column of brecciated Pleistocene material, on the other side of the now 3-meter wide shaft. Excavation necessitated the building of scaffolding from the bottom of the shaft. The presence of nesting rock doves at the time of the investigation gave the shaft its name. Between 1992 and 1999, rubble from the mine was investigated, and after 1994 the shaft itself was investigated; those investigations continue today, under the auspices of the Murcian Association for the Study of Palaeoanthropology and the Quaternary. Archeological finds There are three main sites for archeological remains: the rubble left by mining, which are difficult to date and lack context; a \\"lens\\" of brecciated √©boulis with remains over 50,000 years old; and the layers excavated inside the shaft, with remains of around 40,000 years old. The remains of around 100 human fossils were found, and some of them suggest they may have been buried. According to the authors of the 2008 study \\"Late Neandertals in Southeastern Iberia: Sima de las Palomas del Cabezo Gordo, Murcia, Spain\\", the findings confirm the late occurrence of Neanderthals on the Iberian peninsula, and \\"suggest microevolutionary processes and/or population contact with contemporaneous modern humans to the north\\". Morphological variation in the remains falls outside of the expected range of variation among Neanderthals, and \\"this pattern may be result of genetic drift in relative isolation, directional change or, perhaps more likely, population contact to the north\\". =Palomas 96= An individual called Palomas 96, a young Neanderthal woman discovered in 2006-2007, shows properties of both European Neanderthals (in face, teeth, limbs, and body proportions, but her \\"locomotor hypertrophy\\" resembles that of humans of the Late Pleistocene. She was short compared to other Neanderthals. Palomas 96 (nicknamed \\"Paloma\\" by the researchers) was found 85% complete; underneath her was Palomas 97, a child, tentatively referred to as hers. Palomas 96 was found with her elbows bent and her hands touching her forehead, like Palomas 97. The bodies were in this position before rigor mortis had set in, suggesting burial.

The present building was begun in the 14th century, and was expanded in 1876. The parish became Lutheran in 1570.  History  The location of Werther appeared as \\"Wartera\\" first in a document before 1009. A church was first mentioned in 1312. Archeological research below the church found remnants of a building from the 9th century, described as a simple building without tower, surrounded by a cemetery. Around 1200, a church was built in the shape of a cross from . The nave of the present church was begun in the 14th century in Gothic style, with a ribbed vault over consoles and semicircular wall templates. The church was dedicated to Jakobus der √Ñltere, as a document from 1748 supports. In 1570, Werther and its church became Lutheran. The building was expanded in 1876/77 by a transept and a choir, following designs by A. Hartmann in Gothic Revival style. He decorated the south transept with a display facade (Schaufassade). The transepts have galleries. The stained-glass choir windows were created by the K√∂niglichen Institut f√ºr Glasmalerei (Royal Institute for Stained Glass) in Berlin in 1878, the central one being a donation by the Prussian King. In 1981, the historic interior of the late 19th century was restored. The foundation of the west tower was dated in the 13th century, while the upper tower was added in 1876/77. It is the highest building in Werther, dominating the skyline. The parish belongs to the Halle district of the Evangelische Kirche von Westfalen. It took until 2009 to find confirmation in the archives that the original dedication was to Jakobus the Elder (James the Great), and not to Jakobus the Younger (James, son of Alphaeus).

It was set up on the grounds of a former World War II munitions factory just south of Kidderminster, southwest of Birmingham. It opened on 1 January 1952 and remains in use . Previous UK rocket motors, like those on the RP-3, used Cordite as their propellant, formed into a solid using various binders and then moulded into cylinders with internal cavities to control the rate of burn. While the US adopted the UK concept of shaped cavities, the UK adopted the US double-base powder, which was the basis for contemporary US rocket designs and offered higher energy. The combination of these two features formed the basis for military rockets until the introduction of aluminum-boosted propellants in the 1960s. Since its formation, the site has produced rocket motors for many UK weapons systems. Among its early successes was a motor design for the Sea Slug missile, which allowed that design to switch from a liquid fuel rocket, considered a hazard on ships. Other successes include the motors for Vigilant, Swingfire, MILAN, Thunderbird, Seacat, Sea Dart, Sea Wolf and Sea Skua. Over the years, solid rocket design was centralized at Summerfield, taking on employees from the Rocket Propulsion Establishment and the Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment at the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills as those establishments closed. Summerfield was initially run by Imperial Chemical Industries, but in 1975 it was handed off to their subsidiary, Imperial Metal Industries (IMI) to become IMI Summerfield. The division was purchased by British Aerospace in 1998 and over the next few years changed name several times until BAe merged the division with the French firm Celerg to form Roxel. Today the site is officially known as Roxel (UK Rocket Motors) Limited.

He was an executive board member of the Trade, Banking and Insurance Union (HBV; now Ver.di) from 1980 to 1992.  Biography  G√∂tz was born on 25 January 1940 in Leer. His father was a lock keeper. He attended schools in Leer and Ostfriesland from 1946 to 1954. He then worked in Leer's local government from 1954 to 1959. G√∂tz volunteered for the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) and Young Socialists in the SPD, becoming a chairman in 1958 and a federal committee member. He began performing military service in 1960 and finished in 1963. He then served as a consultant in the SPD parliament assisted by Fritz Erler. He answered questions about the Bundeswehr's \\"Inner guidance\\". G√∂tz served as Federal Youth Secretary of the Trade, Banking, and Insurance Union (HBV) in D√ºsseldorf from 1973 to 1971. G√∂tz was generated controversy within the DGB's Federal Youth Committee because he was a Bundeswehr advocate. At the 3rd Federal Youth Conference in 1968, he strongly suppert the HBV's position on political issues and advoated for more intensive political education work as well as the involvement of youth organizations in trade unions. G√∂tz's political views supported friendly relations between East and West Germany as well as declarations of the Federal Youth Conference against the Vietnam War and Greece's military dictatorship. From 1972 to 1980 G√∂tz served as an HBV contributing editor and spokesperson. Due to G√∂tz's change of attitude regarding the involment of former Bundeswehr propagan in the peace movement, he was criticized by DGB. He supported the HBV awarding the \\"War prize\\" to writer Heinz Konsalik at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Its alternative award, Peace Prize, was intended to expose peace-threatening content in books while books without peace-threatening tendencies were branded. G√∂tz then served as a member of the HBV's main executive board from 1980 to 1992. He was responsible for youth, participation, educational and cultural work, tariff policy in the housing industry and in travel agencies, and other policies. He simultaneously served as a supervisory board member with Horten AG und Xerox and several other companies from 1980 to 1993. From 1993 G√∂tz worked as a freelance journalist and author for (VS; English:German Writer's Asscociation). U.a. he wrote biographies on former DGB chairman Heinz Oskar Vette and author Bertha von Suttner. He also published books on socio- political topics and two volumes of general truth. G√∂tz and his wife were killed in the crash of Air France Flight 4590 on 25 July 2000 near Paris.

Prior to 1635, France had supported opponents of its Habsburg rivals in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, but avoided direct involvement. This included backing the Dutch revolt against Spain, and Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years War. After the Swedish- German Heilbronn League was defeated at N√∂rdlingen in September 1634, France decided to enter the war. In the Treaty of Compi√®gne, they agreed to continue subsidising Swedish intervention in the Holy Roman Empire, and to declare war on Spain, beginning the 1635 to 1659 Franco-Spanish War. Background A key factor in European politics during the 17th century was the struggle between the Bourbon kings of France and their Habsburg rivals in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. Habsburg territories in the Spanish Netherlands, Franche-Comt√©, and the Pyrenees blocked French expansion, and made it vulnerable to invasion. Under Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister from 1624 until his death in 1642, French policy was to 'arrest the course of Spanish progress', and 'protect her neighbours from Spanish oppression'. Dutch exile Hugo Grotius, appointed Swedish ambassador to Paris in 1635 With France weakened by domestic conflict, prior to 1634 Richelieu focused on supporting Habsburg opponents and creating defensive alliances, but avoiding direct conflict. The 1624 Treaty of Compi√®gne agreed to fund the Dutch revolt against Spain for three years, which was then renewed in 1627. Under the 1631 Treaty of B√§rwalde, Richelieu also backed Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years War by financing a Swedish army of 36,000 for five years. In 1633, Sweden and a number of German Protestant states formed the Heilbronn League, which suffered a serious defeat at N√∂rdlingen in September 1634. This crisis moved Richelieu closer to direct intervention in the Thirty Years War; in October, French garrisons occupied towns in Alsace on the left bank of the Rhine, then part of the Empire. Richelieu also proposed replacing B√§rwalde with the Treaty of Paris, an agreement between France and the Heilbronn League. Although accepted by the Swedish representative L√∂ffler, as well as the Germans, it was rejected by Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna. His main objection was that by paying subsidies to the Heilbronn League, rather than direct to Sweden, France gained much greater control over Sweden's German allies. L√∂ffler was replaced by the exiled Dutch lawyer, Hugo Grotius, who was appointed Swedish Ambassador to France and ordered to discuss new terms. The main French negotiator, Fran√ßois Leclerc du Tremblay, continued to try and persuade him to accept the Treaty of Paris, delaying agreement. In February 1635, the Imperial army made significant gains in the Rhineland, and Oxenstierna himself traveled to Paris in April; the combination brought the two sides to rapid agreement on a new treaty between Sweden and France, signed on 30 April. Provisions The treaty renewed the financial provisions made at B√§rwalde, and set out zones of control in the Rhineland; Sweden recognised French ownership of the right bank, from Strasbourg to Breisach, while France agreed to ensure Sweden retained Mainz, Benfeld and Worms. To satisfy Richelieu's domestic critics, who questioned his alliances with Protestant powers, Sweden accepted the restoration of Catholicism in areas where it had been practised prior to 1618; France undertook to declare war on Spain, and both parties agreed not to make a separate peace. Aftermath In addition to the treaty with the Swedes, France signed agreements with Bernard of Saxe-Weimar to provide 16,000 troops for a campaign in Alsace and the Rhineland, and an anti-Spain alliance with the Dutch. Oxenstierna delayed ratification of the treaty until 19 May, when France formally declared war on Spain and invaded the Spanish Netherlands. In May 1635, most of their German allies made peace in the 1635 Treaty of Prague, and the Heilbronn League was dissolved. The combination of these events is generally considered to mark the point at which the Thirty Years War stopped being primarily a religious conflict.

It was formed of 108 UK citizens, chosen to be representative of the population. Its last meeting was delayed to May due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the group's report was published in September 2020.  Establishment  A group of 108 UK citizens, chosen to be representative of the UK population, were determined from randomly sampling the population. Invitations to enter a pool of 1,500 people for selection were sent to 30,000 people. Some places were reserved for people from more deprived postcodes, to combat an expected response rate bias. Participants were chosen with a view to be representative of demographics including age, gender, education, ethnicity, location and attitude towards climate change. The group was the second citizen's group formed by the UK government, following a smaller citizen's group on social care in 2018.. Unlike the French Citizens convention for ecological transition which is called for by the French government, the assembly was organised by MPs on six parliamentary select committees. It was funded by the British parliament and by the European Climate Foundation and Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation.  Activities  The work of the convention was originally planned to be held in person over four weekends. The last weekend was moved online and split over three weekends due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing lockdown restrictions in the UK. Discussion took place over the internet, with printed resources sent in the post and the option to join via landline. It ran from January 2020 to May 2020. The group were first given talks by expert speakers on the subject of climate change. There were 47 speakers, including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers' Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies.  Outcome  = First principles = In the first weekend, the citizen chose their priorities. Aims included \\"informing and educating everyone\\" and making greener products and services affordable and accessible to all. They wanted a \\"clear, proactive, accountable and consistent\\" government leadership. Other priorities include natural world protection, engaging local communities and acting with \\"urgency\\". The group wanted cross- party consensus, as the changes are to be implemented in the next decades by different governments = Green Covid-19 recovery plan = 80% of the assembly members voted that government's coronavirus economic recovery measures should be designed to also help the country to meet its target of carbon emissions reduction until reaching net zero in 2050. = Final report = The assembly published its final report of 556 pages in September 2020. It recommended changes in all economics sectors. It encouraged meat-and-dairy consumption reduction, switching to zero-carbon heating and generation of clean electricity. Proposed measures include a levy for frequent fliers, a ban on the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2030-35 and a switch to a more biodiversity-focused farming system. They preferred \\"natural\\" carbon removal efforts, such as restoring forests, peatlands and other natural habitats to technical solutions, such as carbon capture and storage. Each measure is listed with the level of support received in the assembly and the advantages and disadvantages seen by the assembly.  Reception  Chief executive Chris Stark declared that the Committee on Climate Change will consider the group's recommendations. The MPs that originated the assembly requested the prime minister to respond to the report before the end of 2020. Craig Bennett, of Friends of the Earth, told the Financial Times that the assembly \\"could play an important role\\" but should not \\"delay things further\\".

Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, is usually regarded as different from its other Eastern European neigbours members of the organization, where illiberal and populist politics dominate. History In 2018, Daniel Dragomir, a former Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) member, said in Facebook Romania should leave the European Union (EU). Dragomir, a nationalist against the anti-corruption policies of the country, stated that EU membership is affecting Romanian national sovereignty and that Brussels \\"is robbing from us\\". This statement has been proven to be false, as Romania then received more money than it gave to the EU. He said this after Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, criticized the justice reforms that were then taking place in Romania. Dragomir published a list of 10 reasons why it should leave the EU. Some political parties in Romania advocate the proposal as well. An example is Noua DreaptƒÉ, a right-wing party, opposes Romanian presence in the EU and NATO. However, other politicians like Corina Cre»õu, a former European Commissioner for Regional Policy, criticized the idea, calling it a \\"luxury\\" and listing several moments in which the EU has helped the country. Victor Negrescu, the then Romanian Minister Delegate for European Affairs, said the idea is not taken into account at political level in the country and that it has only been created to \\"stir controversy\\". He instead advocated for the integration of Romania in European politics. It is thought that although it would not provoke any disaster, the Romanian withdrawal from the EU would create problems for both. The large Romanian diaspora in EU member countries would be affected, and a mass return would harm both Romania and the countries in which they reside. In addition, the EU accounts for more than 75% of Romanian exports and imports and many Romanian companies need European funds to sustain themselves. Public opinion Euroscepticism is generally not very popular among Romanians. According to a poll from 2015, 65.6% of Romanians thought that joining the EU had been beneficial for their country. This represented a very notable change compared to the 2013 poll; only 35% saw the EU as beneficial. Furthermore, 58% agreed with the adoption of the euro in 2015 compared to 35% in 2013.

She began her career as a musician and was a teacher of music, language, and literature at the secondary and college levels. In the later part of her career, Allen worked for the American Fisheries Society (AFS), where she helped establish their membership magazine Fisheries and the J. Frances Allen scholarship (named for her older sister) for young women pursuing doctoral degrees in fisheries science. She is regarded as a pioneer for scientific publications and inclusion of women in fisheries and made significant contributions to the field of fisheries and AFS through her literary accomplishments.  Education  Allen was born on January 24, 1918 in Arkville, New York to J.W. Allen and Mattie Jo Linkous Allen. Allen attended high school in Owego, NY and Roxbury, NY, graduating with a College Entrance Regents Diploma in 1934. She received a BS in Education and an AB in Latin from Radford State Teachers College (now Radford University) in Radford, VA. She was further certified to teach in band and orchestra and public school music. She received an MA in English from the University of Georgia in 1956 and took graduate courses in School Law and Administration. She attended the University of Maryland for a doctoral program in English, where she completed all courses but did not finish the program.  Career  = Music = Along with her sister, Allen was one of two women in the Triple Cities Traction Company Symphonic Band when she was a teenager. She and her sister both played flute and piccolo in the band. She also held positions as an organist and choir director and organized and directed a group of professional singers, called \\"The Holiday Singers\\", who performed at nursing and retirement homes, civic clubs, jails, and other organizations. = Teaching = Allen spent the early part of her career as a teacher for music, language, and world literature at the secondary and college levels. She taught English, Latin, French, German, and music in secondary schools.

Very little is known of her life, but it is thought she may have belonged to a sub-branch of the Woods family from the Tal-y-llyn area, in north-west Anglesey.Nesta Lloyd (ed.), Seventeenth-Century Poetry Anthology, Volume I, Barddas Publications, (1993) Gwdman is a rare example of a female poet of the early modern period. Only one of her poems survives, 'Cwynfan merch ifanc am ei chariad' ('A young girl's complaint about her sweetheart'), a tale of unrequited love in the Welsh language, but it is so finely crafted that it reveals that Gwdman was experienced in composing poetry. The subject of the poem is also very unusual, as it is a passionate love song (that can be sung to the tune 'Rogero') for a young man named Edward Wynn (d. c1637) of Bodewryd. From the poem he seems too noble for a girl of Gwdman's modest social status and her love affair is unsuccessful. She says that they talked often as he passed by, and that she thought he felt the same way for her as she did for him. She complains of her misfortune after the young man she loved had to marry another girl who was a more suitable partner. Gwdman vows that she will never love another and will travel to Rome to become a nun.Jane Stevenson and Peter Davidson (eds), Early Modern Women Poets (1520-1700): An Anthology, Oxford University Press (2001), pp. 157-160 The poem was probably written in about 1616, in which year Edward Wynn of Bodewyrd married Margaret, the daughter of Edward Puleston of Llwyn-y-Cnotie, the parson of Llanynys. Edward Wynn was Sheriff of Anglesey in 1627-8, and again in 1634-5. In 1631 he paid the fine for not receiving a knight's order.

It was part of the wider Battle of Transylvania and resulted in a tactical victory for the Central Powers. Background On 27 August 1916, Romania joined World War I on the side of the Allies by invading Transylvania, at that time part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary. The advance of the Romanian 1st Army north of the Red Tower Pass came to a halt on 10 September, when Sellenberk (»òelimbƒÉr/Schellenberg) was taken.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, pp. 211-213William Dunseath Eaton, Harry C.

Popovici and his staff arrived in Nagytalm√°cs on 16 September. Popovici had two divisions, the 13th Division of General Ioan Oprescu being the one deployed to the east.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 103-104 and 106 On 19 September, General Erich von Falkenhayn assumed command of the German 9th Army. Among the units of this army was the Schmettow Cavalry Corps, comprising the 1st Austro-Hungarian and 3rd German Cavalry Division, both under von Schmettow's command, the 3rd Division's commander. As part of von Falkenhayn's plan for the Battle of Nagyszeben, von Schmettow had to block any reinforcements that might have come from the Romanian 2nd Army, threatening the 9th Army's vulnerable flank.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 99-100 and 102-103 Battle The left of the Central Powers forces - the German column which was to encircle the Romanians from the east - succeeded in forcing the crossing of the Olt River at Kolun (Colun/Kellen), east of Porumb√°k (Porumbacu/Bornbach). Thus, an effective barrier was created between the 1st and the 2nd Romanian armies. In its advance across the mountain ridge separating the valleys of the Hortob√°gy (H√¢rtibaciu/Haarbach) and Olt Rivers, this German column was faced with determined resistance.

She wrote a variety of popular books, including multiple biographies of historical figures. Deaf from childhood, Pitrois advocated for the welfare of deaf and deafblind people in her work, including the founding of two magazines featuring advice and inspirational stories about deaf people. She was awarded the Montyon Prize in 1929 for her lifelong efforts in support of the deaf and deafblind community. Early life and education Yvonne Pitrois was born on December 14, 1880 in Paris. Born hearing, she lost her hearing at age seven after a bout of fevers caused by severe heat stroke. Her eyesight was also damaged after this illness; her vision deteriorated from age seven through twelve, but she eventually recovered some sight. Her mother, a teacher and writer who ran a bilingual French-English school, educated Pitrois at home. Pitrois read French and English fluently and was able to read lips in both languages. Writing career Beginning at age seventeen, Pitrois translated works from England and America into French, and published articles in periodicals in France, England, Switzerland, and the United States. She was a regular contributor to the U.S. newspaper The Silent Worker, including a column titled \\"From the Old World\\" sharing information about deaf institutions in Europe. She used this platform to highlight the work of other deaf women, including French author Marie Len√©ru. Pitrois published her first book, a collection of stories about humble lives titled Jeunes vies, at age eighteen. Her book Abraham Lincoln, le lib√©rateur des esclaves was published in three editions. Other books included Ombres des femmes, a collection of biographies of famous women, and Cherie, an idyll for young women. Her most famous work, a biography of Abb√© Charles-Michel de l'√âp√©e, was published in 1912 on the 200th anniversary of √âp√©e's birth. She published and edited La Petite Silencieuse, a magazine for deaf girls and young women, from 1912 until her death in 1937. The bimonthly magazine featured advice for young deaf people as well as biographical sketches of contemporary deaf people. Pitrois wrote letters to each of the 900 subscribers. In 1928 Pitrois founded a second magazine, Le Rayon de Soleil des Sourds‚ÄêAveugles, written in French Braille for the deafblind. Most of the magazine's issues were dedicated to sharing information and ideas among the deafblind community. Pitrois's biography of Helen Keller, Une nuit rayonnante, was published in 1922. Pitrois and Keller were acquainted through the Cosmopolitan Correspondence Club, a deaf letter writing exchange for people in the Western world. Since Pitrois had experienced deafblindness as a child, and because she was a deaf woman writer, she was well placed to write about Keller's life. Pitrois wrote with empathy and strong admiration of Keller, though she critiqued Keller's performances on the vaudeville circuit as being an offensive spectacle. She was a member of the Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres, a French writers' society. She helped obtain books and periodicals about deafness for the library of Selwyn Oxley, an English educator whose collection of books would be the foundation of the University College London Ear Institute and Action on Hearing Loss Libraries. Service to the deaf community During World War I, Pitrois organized collections of financial support to help deaf people who were left without food or shelter by occupying German armies. She wrote about the suffering of the deaf community in France and Belgium during the war in The Silent Worker, requesting funds from American readers. In her column, she translated letters and featured photographs of the recipients of those grants. She helped reunite deaf refugees with their families and placed deaf children in school programs. Pitrois received a Medal of Honor from the Soci√©t√© nationale d'encouragement au bien in 1920 and was awarded the Prix Montyon in 1929 from the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise for her work in improving the lives of deaf and deafblind people. The Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise made her an officer for her literary work. After the end of the war and the death of her mother, Pitrois welcomed orphaned or troubled deaf girls and young women to live with her in her rural cottage in Brittany. She died in France on April 23, 1937. Selected publications * Coeurs aimants. Gen√®ve : J.H. Jeheber, 1905 * La fille de Victor Hugo. Lausanne : G.

It was constructed at various stages between the early 17th century and the 1920s, on the site of an earlier church which had existed since at least 1575.  History  The first mention of a church on the site of the sanctuary is in a 1575 report by Pietro Dusina, in which he stated that it attracted some devotion. This building is believed to have been replaced by a new church in 1610. Bishop Baldassare Cagliares made a pastoral visit to various churches in Birkirkara in 1615, including to one dedicated to the Assumption of Mary which was referred to as Tal-ƒ¶erba (meaning \\"of the ruin\\" in the Maltese language). The origins of this name or nickname are unclear, and a discredited theory stated it was a corruption of Tal-ƒ¶arba (meaning \\"of the escape\\") in reference to fleeing Ottoman troops after the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. It might also be the case that the church was known as Tal-ƒ¶erba because it was already old by the early 17th century, or that it got its name from the ruinous state of its surroundings at the time of its construction. According to tradition, at one point a crippled man who had crutches heard the church's bell ringing and was miraculously healed after entering the building. This supposed miracle led to increased devotion to Our Lady of Tal-ƒ¶erba among the Maltese population, and the church is said to have also attracted visitors from Sicily, mainland Italy, England, France and Spain. By 1640, the church had become too small to cater for these needs, and sometime before 1644 a new church dedicated to the Nativity of Mary was constructed in front of the original building. Over time the latter lost its importance and it was no longer used for worship by 1673. Some time later it was converted into a sacristy for the new building. Crucifix above the church's entrance In 1774, the old church was demolished and it was replaced by a Rococo building. It was dedicated by bishop Vincenzo Labini on 23 March 1783. Between the late 18th and early 20th centuries, various popes and bishops granted indulgences to the church, including Popes Clement XIV, Pius VI, Pius IX, Leo XIII and Pius X and bishops Labini, Gaetano Pace Forno and Pietro Pace. The church's portico and bell tower were added in 1797. In 1923, the sanctuary was enlarged to its present configuration, and a dome was added. The bell tower, portico, side chapel, sacristy and oratory of the existing church were retained, and by this point almost no remains of the 1610 church still existed. This enlargement was officially the work of the architect Edwin Vassallo, although it is believed that the designs were actually made by his father Andrea Vassallo, who credited them to his son because he was prevented from carrying out private commissions due to his role as a government architect. A hall to house ex-voto offerings was constructed in 1955, and some restoration work was carried out in the 1990s. The church falls under the jurisdiction of Birkirkara's parish of St Helen. The building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.  Architecture  The church as viewed from the rear, with its dome visible The church has a cruciform plan, and it includes a dome and a single bell tower. A long parvis is located in front of the church's fa√ßade, and a staircase leads to a portico which is topped by a statue of the Virgin Mary. The portico leads to the church's entrance, above which there is a crucifix. Apart from the nave and altar in the choir, the church has a side chapel and a sacristy.  Artworks  The church's altarpiece depicts the Virgin Mary along with John the Baptist, a guardian angel and souls in purgatory. It was painted between 1668 and 1679, and it replaced an earlier altarpiece which is now located in the sanctuary's side chapel. The painting was crowned by Bishop Pietro Pace on 7 August 1910. The church also contains a number of other artworks, including paintings at side altars and frescoes on the dome and roof. These depict scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, and they were painted by the artist ƒ†u≈ºeppi Briffa between 1926 and 1959. The church also contains about 500 ex-voto paintings and other offerings, which are held in a special hall. This is the largest collection of ex-voto in Malta, and it includes around 183 paintings with maritime themes. Some of the ex-voto at Tal-ƒ¶erba are of considerable historical significance: examples include a 1740 painting which is the oldest known depiction of a speronara and an 1840 painting which depicts the crew of a ship being massacred by pygmies in West Africa.

It is a left tributary of the Bomokandi River, which in turn is a tributary of the Uele River. Course The Makongo flows through the province of Bas-U√©l√© in a generally NNE direction to its confluence with the Bomokandi. The river rises to the south of the RP415 road. It roughly defines the boundary between the Ganga Dingila Health Zone to the west and the Poko Health Zone to the east. It passes the village of Makongo on its left bank. It enters the Bomokandi to the northwest of Digili. It flows through the Bambesa Territory. History The oral history of the Lika people of Wamba Territory states that they came from Bambili (Boa). During their migration some of them stayed beside the Makongo River in the eastern part of Poko Territory, at least from the area they occupy today. The Congo-Nile Expedition of Willem Frans Van Kerckhoven passed through the region in 1891. Captain Pierre Ponthier had to clear the country of Arabs. They had settled on the Makongo and on islands in the Bomokandi. He defeated them in some sharp engagements, helped by local people who could no longer tolerate the slavers. In late October 1891 the Ababua chief Sikito defeated the trader Purukandu on the route from the Boyoma Falls to the Makongo. According to Gustave Gustin the meeting must have taken place on the upper Bima River in mountainous terrain.

Early life and education  Hunter was an undergraduate at the University of Washington, where she studied wildlife sciences and statistics. For her graduate studies she moved down the West Coast, joining the University of California. Hunter completed her doctoral degree at the University of California, Davis. As part of her doctorate she worked on the University of California reserves. After graduating, Hunter volunteered with Audubon California's Landowner Stewardship program.  Research and career  Hunter studied the carnivorous animals of the Americas. As part of these efforts, Hunter showed that, unlike other mammals, skunks did not have strategies to avoid predators. Instead, skunks have an abrupt discrimination of dark and light colouring, which warns predators of their noxious scent. In 2012 Hunter joined the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where she studied mahi-mahi, Cobia and Spanish mackerel. In 2014 Hunter returned to the University of California, joining Berkeley as project coordinator for the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory at Angelo Coast Range Reserve. The laboratory investigates the interaction of abiotic and biotic factors with the near-surface environment. Hunter was appointed Director of the Hastings Natural History Reservation in Carmel Valley, which is one of the oldest field stations in the world. The reserve is 2,500 acres and home to three seasonal creeks.  Personal life  Hunter is married with two children.

Trout Lake is a 15-minute drive from Ophir via Colorado State Highway 145 and a 30-minute drive from Telluride.  History  Trout lake was originally explored by American fur-trappers and pioneers, who often used the lake as a stopping point for their expeditions. The population of Trout Lake grew after the construction of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad and the nearby Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant in the 1890s. = Early History = While it is unknown if Spanish, Mexican, or Native American explorers reached Trout Lake previously, the first record of Trout Lake was taken by an American fur trapping expedition. In the spring of 1831, the St. Louis Fur Company employed a party of 60 men under the command of Colonel William G Walton to trap beavers and other fur-bearing animals along the headwaters of the San Juan River. The party spent the summer of 1833 in the valley of the Rio Dolores and at Trout Lake before continuing their journey northward. On June 14, 1882, the first post office in Trout Lake was established. At the time is was described as \\"a post office, with a small lake near it\\" and \\"a miner's camp of about a score in number\\". Between 1875 and 1885, the area around Trout Lake was often visited by prospectors, but after 10 years of searching, no mines were found near Trout Lake and the post office closed. In the 1885 Colorado Census, Trout Lake was recorded as having a population of 40. The post office was reopened between 1890 and 1892 with the construction of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad in 1891. On June 13, 1905, Trout Lake became a part of the newly created Montezuma Forest Reserve with the signing of Proclamation 575 by Theodore Roosevelt. The Montezuma Forest Reserve became a National Forest on March 4, 1907. On July 1, 1947, Montezuma National Forest as split between San Juan National Forest and Uncompahgre National Forest, with Trout Lake becoming part of Uncompahgre National Forest. The 1910 Census recorded Trout Lake as having a population of 62. = Trout Lake Dam = Trout Lake is a natural lake but was expanded in the 1894 with the construction of the Trout Lake Dam by Telluride Power Co. The purpose of the dam was to create additional reserves for the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant 3.25 miles downstream. Trout Lake still supplies the Ames Hydroelectric Plant via a concrete-encased outlet pipe that transports water from the Trout Lake Dam's Penstock to the Ames Hydroelectric Plant. = 1909 Flood = On September 5, 1909, heavy rains and flooding caused the failure of the Trout Lake and Middle Dams. A defect in the Middle Dam's outlet, which permitted water to wash away the soil under the dam, likely contributed to the flood. The collapse of the dams released approximately 2,000 Acre-feet of water downstream, killing livestock, destroying miles of railroad track, and flooding the nearby towns of Placerville, Sawpit, and Newmire. The Ames Hydroelectric plant remained mostly unharmed. While no one died in the flood, the damage to property was estimated to be $200,000 (approximately $ today). In 1910, the dam was rebuilt with soil and rock instead of the timber used in the previous dam. In 1954, the dam's spillway was rebuilt to prevent flooding in Trout Lake. The spillway included two steel siphons that discharge water 200 feet downstream from the dam into Lake Fork. View of the trestle after stabilization work was completed in 2004 = Rio Grande Southern Railroad = Starting in 1891, Trout Lake was used as a watering station for the Rio Grande Southern Railroad (RGS), which used the water from the lake to fill its steam engines. There were 15 similar stations used by the RGS, all of which were serviced by a large force of men called \\"water service\\" who maintained the water tanks. While the railroad is no longer in operation, the 50,000 gallon wood watering tank (one of only two left) and a nearby railroad trestle remain. After the railroad was abandoned in 1952 the trestle continued to be used as an automobile bridge for several years until a detour was built around it. The trestle was added to the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties on May 14, 1997. The trestle was stabilized in 2004 with grant funds from the Colorado Historical Fund, Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, San Miguel County, and US Forest Service.  Recreation  Trout Lake had become a popular tourist attraction as early as 1920, especially for fishing. Today, the area around the lake features multiple hiking trails, which in the winter are groomed by the Telluride Nordic Association to be used for cross-country skiing. The lake is also used for boating and fishing.

In 2011, DOC‚Äôs music release ‚ÄúThe Storm‚Äù which he co-wrote and performs with his brother Spencer Battiest garnered his first Best Music Video win at the American Indian Film Institute held in San Francisco, California. The song was written as a tribute to the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and homage to his parents, grandparents and tribal leaders. The song was later produced into a music video that was directed by Kiowa/Choctaw filmmaker Steven Paul Judd as part of the tribe‚Äôs summer youth program provided by the Seminole tribe inviting students to participate in film productions. Additionally, it was nominated for three Native American Music Awards (NAMMY's): \\"Best Rap/Hip Hop Recording,\\" \\"Debut Artist of the Year,\\" \\"Song/Single of the Year\\" and continues to be showcased internationally at all Hard Rock Restaurants and various events Early life Zachary aka DOC Native was born in Hollywood, Florida to June Lena Baker Battiest (Seminole) and Henry Lee Battiest, Jr (Choctaw). Zachary grew up between Broken Bow, Oklahoma and the Hollywood Seminole Indian Reservation. He graduated from Hollywood Christian School. Performing at the age of 6, his father, who was a worship leader and head of their local church, the Independent Bible Baptist Church in Hollywood, Florida taught him and his younger brother Spencer to sing gospel hymns that branched out to performing at their local church and family gatherings. Thereafter, Zachary branched out to perform for school plays such as landing the lead in Prodigal Son. While attending vacation bible school at age 11, he received his first set of drums, which he enjoyed as he was not pressured to be the center of attention on stage. Not pressured with all eyes on him allowed him to enjoy and independently grow playing drums. While playing drums for the church, he was given the incentive that the more he improved he would receive a new drum kit. When he received his new drum set he knew there was more responsibilities. Coming for a musical family, his grandfather, mother, and father were all gospel singers. Each summer their church band would tour and play at Indian churches until he was 17yrs old. At 15yrs old, his cousin and uncle got him interested in hip-hop music. He and his cousin would record in local flea in South Florida where the hip-hop culture was growing. With his new interest in the music of hip-hop he became friends with rappers from Miami that taught him how to break down16-bars, flow and delivery to hone his craft. From this mentorship, along with Curtis Lema he started crafting his own music. His musical influences have been Ludacris, Notorious BIG, Tupac, DMX and JayZ. One of his earlier mentors was Kenny Brown, a member of Liberty City who wrote and performs the popular NBA Miami Heat theme song. As he reached his 20s, Zachary got on stage and would run music for his younger brother Spencer Battiest while he performed. In addition, he would work and support his brother as an artist and helped him with songwriting and mixing of his musical performances. Music One evening in 2011, while sharing music mixes with his brother, Spencer, he and his brother would collaborate and write a historical, cultural song about their tribe. As recalled by Zachary, while they were in the studio, the chords came together and they started writing lyrics that would evolved into the contemporary tribal anthem ‚ÄúThe Storm‚Äù that encapsulates the history of tribal stories recalled from their grandmother and Chief James Billie shared with the brothers. He and his brother completed the song in one night, which also helped him also become known as an individual artist. The song is considered a tribal anthem of the survival of the Seminoles. The song was later produced into a music video that was directed by Kiowa/Choctaw filmmaker Steven Paul Judd as part of the tribe‚Äôs summer youth program provided by the Seminole tribe inviting students to participate in film productions. The music video was filmed entirely on the Seminole Reservation in Florida highlighting historical tribal land, ancestry and culture. The song was written as a tribute to the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and homage to his parents, grandparents and tribal leaders. The video garnered their first award for \\"Best Music Video\\" at the 36th Annual American Indian Film Festival held in San Francisco, California, and was an official selection at ImagineNATIVE ‚Äì Film & Media Arts Festival held in Toronto, Canada, and the Santa Fe Native Cinema showcase sponsored by the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indians and SWAIA Santa Fe Indian Market where it won their second \\"Best Music Video award. Additionally, it was nominated for three Native American Music Awards (NAMMY's): \\"Best Rap/Hip Hop Recording,\\" \\"Debut Artist of the Year,\\" \\"Song/Single of the Year\\" and continues to be showcased internationally at all Hard Rock Restaurants and various events. After the success of The Storm, both he and his brother branched off and started working on solo careers, but manage to perform again in future concerts. In the summer of 2015, Zachary and his brother performed at the annual Hard Rock Rising Barcelona Global musical festival opening up for noble artists: Robbie Williams, Kings of Leon, Juanes, Lenny Kravitz, Avicii and Steve Angello. The weekend-long event took place at the Platja del Forum (Parc de la Pau, s/n. Sant Adria de Besos, Barcelona) on July 24 and 25, 2015. Zachary is no stranger to hard work, while staying busy running his Midnight Studio, he continued to produce some of the hottest up and coming artists of South Florida and Los Angeles. From his conversation with friend and mentor Jay Garland, he convinces Zachary of his untapped talent and pursued and pursue a solo career. Zachary selected the stage name ‚ÄúDOC Native‚Äù which stems from a nickname his grandmother called his grandfather ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù he added ‚ÄúNative‚Äù to shed light on his Native American culture so he would stand out as a Native American rapper. In the spring of 2019, DOC Native released his first EP ‚Äì self-entitled with four songs about his personal struggles. Widely known as a music producer and writer he was comfortable behind the scene working for various artists, but now with an EP release he was pushed to the spotlight where he had to face his vulnerability of sharing himself through his music which you can definitely hear in the song These Scars. Other songs on his EP are: Fly Away, Dreamin‚Äô and Let me See all available on Apple, Amazon, and Spotify.

In 1962, Nkomo enlisted in the Zapu‚Äôs underground committee headed by Major Findo Mpofu. For his activities in this committee, Nkomo was arrested and charged with criminal possession of firearm. He denied the allegation but admitted that the CID had found an object in the outside toilet. When the Magistrate asked him to confirm the object that was found he said it was ‚Äúumbankwa‚Äù. When the Magistrate asked him to state the calibre of firearm ‚Äúumbankwa‚Äù is Nokomo responded: ‚ÄúIt is a lizard‚Äù. Following the ban of Zapu by Rhodesian regime, Nkomo intensified his underground committee activities but some members of the group including Boblock Manyonga, Solomon Mabika, Amon Ndukwana Ncube and Misheck Ntundu Velaphi were arrested for allegedly possessing arms of war. In 1964, Nkomo fled the country into exile in Zambia to escape arrest. While in exile, Nkomo became a diplomat representing Zapu in Egypt. In 1967, he was appointed Zapu representative to Algeria, the Maghreb and the Francophone States. During this assignment, Nkomo became friends with Presidents Abdul Nasser of Egypt, Houari Boumedienne of Algeria and Habib Bourghiba of Tunisia. Nkomo was involved in setting up training camps for liberation fighters in Egypt, Algeria, Libya and Palestine. In the first democratic elections in Zimbabwe in 1980, Nkomo was elected into the parliament on the ticket of PF Zapu for Matobo constituency and served in this capacity for the next 10 years. In 1984, he was elected to the Central Committee and appointed of PF Zapu at it National Congress and appointed Secretary for External Affairs. He was Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1992 when he became Governor and Resident Minister of Matabeleland South.

History  The Hantzbahn was laid in 1916 during World War I by German troops, Russian prisoners of war and local civilians as a military light railway using prefabricated rail track panels with a length of 5 meters.  Route  The light railway connected Saint-Blaise via the Hantz Pass with the front line at Ban-de-Sapt, in order to transport weapons, ammunition and supplies to the front and wounded soldiers in the opposite direction to the hospitals.  Operation  Timetable The light railway line started operating in July 1916. The operation was organized according to a timetable with precise service instructions regarding the type of locomotives, the number of wagons, the speeds and the tonnages that had to be complied with depending on the section of the route. A total of 176 people were employed for the smooth operation of the six steam locomotives and four benzene locomotives as well as for the maintenance of the rail vehicles and tracks. It was single track line with eight stations, where trains could be crossed or overtaken using the double- track passing loops. Tunnel-shaped camouflage panel between Spanische Wand station and St. Louis station In the vicinity of the front line, the less powerful gasoline locomotives offered advantages over the 0-8-0 brigade locomotives, because the smoke was easy to spot by the enemy.

Two other species - Drymaeus irazuensis and Drymaeus gabbi - also have bright rose coloured peristomes, but there is no description of their reproductive apparatus in the scientific literature, therefore the taxonomic relationship is not certain yet.  Distribution  D. tripictus is an extremely rare land snail species. This snail is endemic from the central Costa Rican highlands between an altitude of 1300-1700 m. Pilsbry, H. A. (1899). American Bulimulidae: North Ame- rican and Antillean Drymaeus, Leiostracus, Orthali- cinae and Amphibuliminae. Manual of Conchology, (2)12, 1-258.  Ecology  These snails are more active during the night and until early morning. D. tripictus likely feed on algae and cyanobacteria present on moss or lichen. They can be found in the shrubs and understory of the forest. The species is more abundant in the primary forest (0.017 individuals/m2) than in secondary forests (0.001 individuals/m2).  Reproduction  Drymaeus tripictus reproductive system As all other members of this family, D. tripictus has an hermaphrodite reproductive system, meaning one specimen has both male and female genitalia. Mating process of Drymaeus tripictus (Source: Zaidett Barrientos) The mating process is by shell mounting, where the male acting individual slides on top of the female acting individual, followed by multiple stimulatory activity, where the radula of the male acting individual scrapes the shell and the mantle collar of the female acting individual. Finally the male acting individual turns its head, allowing contact between the gonopores, but the phallus is not everted. This process takes between 60-75 minutes and no role switching takes place. Hatching occurs between June and July . This is the only description available for a species of the genus Dryameus.  References  * Thompson, F. G. (2011).

They were first introduced in England and Wales in 1920 alongside the Ordinary National Diploma. In Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Higher Nationals may either be awarded by British degree-awarding bodies under approved licence from Pearson (which allows the Universities to devise, deliver and award Higher Nationals themselves), or they may be awarded directly by Pearson, as an awarding body regulated by Ofqual. In Scotland, Higher Nationals are awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). Higher Nationals are also delivered at both universities and further education colleges in 60 countries around the world through HN Global. Higher Nationals are split into two parts, with students within their first year of study pursuing a Higher National Certificate (HNC is a separate qualification and is not required for a Higher National Diploma award, although it still encompasses the first year content). In the second year of study, students pursue the HND which is generally more extensive and academically rigorous than HNC. Higher Nationals are graded, usually based on a weighted average (with higher weight given to marks in the final year of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments.

Early years (1860‚Äì1885) Ernest Baert was born in Brussels on 12 August 1860. His parents were Polydore Baert and Emilie-Bernardine Duvieusart. He entered the Ecole Militaire on 4 December 1876. He was appointed second lieutenant on 22 December 1878 and assigned on 19 April 1881 to the 5th artillery regiment. He was seconded to the Military Cartographic Institute, and entered service with the International Association of the Congo on 16 June 1885. First Congo term (1885‚Äì1888) Baert embarked on 29 June 1885 at Antwerp on the Baltimore and arrived at Banana on 28 July 1885 He reached Vivi on 2 August 1885. He was assigned to the study of the Bas-Congo railway line, then assigned to the topographic brigade. He spent the first part of his term in the Bas-Congo. He was appointed to replace Willem Frans Van Kerckhoven at the Bangalas station, which he reached on 28 April 1886. The former station head, Camille Coquilhat, was fairly diplomatic and had relied on agreements with the local people and the protection of the chief Mata-Boike, with whom he had exchanged blood. After Mata-Boike's death in 1886, the inhabitants of the station felt threatened and began to use force against the neighboring villages. The European leaders at the time, Baert and Van Kerckhoven, were no longer bound by blood pacts. They set out to bring the local population into total submission. Baert attacked the Bapoto of Lisala on the pretext of the release of the soldiers captured by the Bapoto. Van Kerckhoven subdued the villages in the South to end the slave trade on the Lulonga River. Baert undertook two explorations of the Mongala River despite the hostility of the local people, who attempted to capture the steamers. He left Bangala on 23 November 1886 and ascended the Mongala on the A.I.A. for 66 hours to the furthest point reached by his predecessors George Grenfell and Camille Coquilhat. The large local population became increasingly hostile as the expedition advanced, and attacked it several times. He reached Mongwandi (Businga) and the Ebola-Dua confluence on 1 December 1886, and founded a station at Moboika before returning to Bangalas. He had shown that the Mongala could be used as a route to reach the Ubangi and Uele rivers. Baert made many improvements to the post of Bangalas. He set up sites for the manufacture of tiles and paving stones, and increased the cultivation of coffee and cotton. He was replaced at Bangalas by Hubert Lothaire. Accompanied by Tippu Tip Baert traveled by land, in a particularly marshy region, from Yambuya on the Aruwimi River to Yangambi on the Congo River in four stages of 8‚Äì11 hours of walking. He reached Yangambi on 17 January 1888. At the end of his term of service he went down to Boma, then to Banana on 20 June 1888, where he embarked for Europe. On his return to Belgium he was received by the king and queen, who congratulated him on his explorations. Second Congo term (1889‚Äì1892) Baert was appointed a district commissioner, left Antwerp on 18 May 1889 on the Lualaba and reached Boma on 19 June 1889. He took over the Bangalas district from Van Kerkhoven on 8 October 1889. He continued his predecessor's system of using rivers to expand power into the interior. At the start of 1890 he went up the Lulonga River to the Maringa River, ascended the Maringa and founded a post in Bauru \\"to combat and prevent incursions by bands of slavers.\\" He founded the Basankusu post at the confluence of the Maringa and the Lopori in May 1890 to stop the Arab raids and put an end to cannibalism and the slave trade. He left Lothaire in command of the post. At first the local people fully supported the pacification of the region, but later the Belgians began a policy of oppression and terror against villages that did not harvest the required amount of rubber. In 1890 he founded the post of Mongwandi at Businga on the Mongala. During an exploration of the Itimbiri River, below the Go Rapids Baert met J√©r√¥me Becker and Sultan Djabir who were going to Djabir's residence on the Zagiri River, a tributary of the Uele River. Baert explored the Lopori River and founded a station at the confluence of this river and the Maringa, at Basankusu. He then handed over command to Lieutenant Lothaire at the end of his second term, and returned to Europe on 30 April 1892. Last Congo term (1892‚Äì1894) Baert was promoted to state inspector. He left Antwerp on the Lualaba on 6 January 1893, and reached Boma on 1 February 1893. When news came than Van Kerckhoven had died, he was appointed to take over the Haut Uele Expedition and planned to reach the Nile by way of Lake Albert. He arrive in Djabir on 2 June 1893. Florimond Delanghe had succeeded Jules Alexandre Milz as commander of the Haut-Uele Expedition, and had reached the Nile. Hearing of Baert's arrival, Delanghe left Labor√© on 17 August 1893 to take Al√©ma and Ganda, taking with him the contingents of the Force Publique that Baert had requested. Baert had been ordered by the king to evacuate the posts from the Nile and focus on consolidating the positions acquired in the Uele basin. However, Baert intended to settle at Kavalli on Lake Albert as soon as possible, to forestall Gerald Portal advancing from Uganda. Rather than travel to the Nile at Dufil√© and then ascend to Lake Albert, Baert decided to take a short route from Ganda to Kavalli through the mountains, risking supply problems and hostile local people. Baert and Ray left Dungu on 14 August 1893 with 86 African soldiers. At Bokoyo they were joined by 350 Azande auxilliaries. They reached Mundu on 28 August 1893. On 21 September 1893 Delanghe was in Ganda, where he heard that Baert was preparing to leave Mundu for Magora and Ganda with Bonvallet, Van Holsbeek, Delmotte and Ray. At Magora difficulties began with the irregulars, some of whom deserted. The Azande from Bokoyo refused to march. On 15 November he wrote to Delange saying he would not advance from Magora. Delanghe, who was recovering from hematuria, therefore had himself carried in a hammock from Ganda to join Baert in Magora. He reached there on 4 December 1893 to find that Baert and Gustin had left for Mundu. Delanghe reached Mundu on 11 December 1893. The forces there were suffering from famine. Baert disarmed the Azande irregulars, but some revolted and attacked the station head Dautzenberg, who required aid from Bonvalet to escape. On 1 January 1894 Baert decided to return to Niangara to prepare a new program for occupying Haut Uele, and to give up maintenance of garrisons in the Lado Enclave and perhaps even on the upper Dungu River. With almost all the garrisons of Haut Uele in revolt, Baert left Mundu for Niangara on 22 January 1894. The Bonvalet-Devos column, which had been told to evacuate the posts east of Dungu, was massacred on 2 March 1894. Baert waited at Niangara for reinforcements so he could again move east, but all available forces were fighting the Arabs in the north of Maniema. Baert therefore decided to abandon all the posts upstream from Djabir and Ibembo apart from Dungu, Akka, Mundu and Gombari. He planned to supply Gombari by a route from the Ituri River to serve as a supply base for operations towards Lake Albert and Bahr-el-Djebel that could be used to reoccupy the Enclave. Baert reached Dungu on 7 July 1894 with Francqui, who was to take over command of Uele District from Delanghe and assist the Nile expedition. Exhausted and suffering from hematuria, Baert died in Dungu on 15 August 1894. In November 1894 Paul Lemar√Ænel succeeded him in command of the Uele region.

It got the name of 'Moon Car' because of its bright yellow colour and because it was mainly used at night. It is most well known for its attack on the British port of Spike Island on 21 March 1924, killing one British soldier and injuring twenty three others, including five civilians.  Previous ownership  There are contrasting accounts over previous ownership of the car. One source reports that the car had previously been owned by the poet Oliver St. John Gogarty. However, other sources credit the car as having been owed by the Adamson family in County Galway. The IRA then commandeered their car when the Adamson house was burnt in 1921.  Early use  It was initially used in the Irish War of Independence by the Cork No 1. Brigade of the IRA. Storage cases beneath the chassis were constructed to contain the Lewis guns when they were not in use. Armour plating was also added to protect the occupants.  Attack on Spike Island  = Background = On 21st March 1924, approximately 5 senior officers of the IRA, disillusioned with the British retaining ownership of several ports following the creation of the Free State, sought to try and start violence between the two countries. One of those involved is believed to be Frank Busteed. They planned to attack British soldiers at Spike Island, an island the British retained off Cobh. They disguised themselves using captured National Army uniforms. = The attack = They opened fire on a harbour launch with two Lewis guns, presumably going between the Island and the mainland. One soldier was killed, seventeen soldiers were wounded, and five civilians were wounded. The one fatality was the 18 year old Private Herbert Aspinall. All of the soldiers were unarmed. While escaping, it fired some shots at HMS Scythe but did not cause any serious damage. Other accounts state that the attack happened when British soldiers were disembarking onto the quayside at Cobh, to then embark another ship to take them to Spike Island. = Aftermath = The car was deemed 'too hot' and had to be disposed of. One account says that the IRA buried it near Donoughmore. Others that it was burnt then the remains buried. The Irish Free State offered ¬£10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those involved in the attack. William T Cosgrave, the president of D√°il √âireann, dismissed the attack as ‚Äúa dastardly outrage‚Äù. The response in the House of Commons included one MP declaring \\"Ireland needed another Cromwell.\\"  Rediscovery and cultural significance  In 1981 Liam O‚ÄôCallaghan found the car but it ended up in a scrap yard in Waterfall all the same. It was not until Andrew Daly found it there in 2006 that the true importance of the car was discovered. It went through a three-year restoration project by James Black Restorations, based in County Antrim. It has since been valued at over ‚Ç¨2,000,000. In January 2020 it was donated to the National Museum of Ireland.

Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios was killed in action during the battle.  Background  Since the end of Second Central American Civil War from 1838 to 1841, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua existed as independent nations that were no longer political entities within the Federal Republic of Central America. During the Liberal Revolution of 30 April 1871, Divisional General Justo Rufino Barrios helped Divisional General Miguel Garc√≠a Granados rise to power and become President of Guatemala, ousting President Vicente Cerna y Cerna in the process. Barrios later became President in 1873 after Garc√≠a Granados retired. Barrios believed in Central American reunification and wanted to recreated a Central American union with himself as President. He was inspired by the unification of Germany under Prussia by Otto von Bismarck to unify Central America under Guatemalan with himself as President. On 28 February 1885, Barrios proclaimed himself President of Central America and that he had supreme authority over every nation of Central America. The National Assembly of Guatemala approved Barrios' declaration during a meeting on 5 March. Barrios believed the other Central American nations would join his union, but only Honduras approved of Barrios' declaration which they approved on 7 March. Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua all denounced the declaration. Barrios mobilized the Guatemalan Army on 10 March in preparation to form his union by force and war began on the afternoon of 29 March 1885. Barrios thought that the threat of force would make El Salvador submit, but he was notified that Salvadoran President Rafael Zald√≠var was assembling his own army to defend against the Guatemalans.  Battle  = 1 April = The Salvadorans under Ad√°n Mora fortified themselves in the town of Chalchuapa and awaited the Guatemalan attack. At around 11am local time, the Guatemalans began an artillery bombardment of the town to weaken the Salvadoran fortifications. The artillery attack lasted until 3pm local time. = 2 April = At 6am local time, Camilo √Ålvarez moved to capture the road connecting Chalchuapa to Santa Ana and Luis Molina covered √Ålvarez's flanks. The town was surrounded by 9am. Barrios himself took charge of a division and attacked the entrenched Salvadoran positions. Barrios was killed in action by Salvadoran soldiers when he was shot in the heart and fell off his horse. Other reports claim that he was shot by a Guatemalan soldier who shot Barrios by accident. Felipe Cruz took command of the Guatemalan army after Barrios' death and continued to fight. He attempted to keep news of Barrios' death from reaching the soldiers, but as morale fell when news spread of his death, Cruz ordered a retreat. The Salvadorans were only made aware of Barrios' death and the Guatemalan retreat on 3 April.  Aftermath  Zald√≠var attempted to make peace with Cruz after the battle but he rejected the peace offer. Peace was agreed upon after Zald√≠var was overthrown by Francisco Men√©ndez on 22 June 1885.

Life  Born in Stuttgart, Minona (actually Johanna) Frieb-Blumauer was the daughter of the actor Karl Blumauer, with whom she received her first lessons. Already as a child, she appeared in Neustrelitz in der Freisch√ºtz and 1828 in Gotha as a boy in the Magic Flute. She studied singing for three years at the Prague Conservatory and was immediately engaged for a guest performance in Darmstadt. She stayed there for three years and then moved to Cologne and Aachen, where she performed successfully under , especially in Gioachino Rossini's operas, for example as Rosine in The Barber of Seville. As her voice was not up to the demands in the long run, she switched to spoken theatre. Karl Immermann brought her to D√ºsseldorf and under his guidance she developed into an outstanding actress. After she had worked as a youthful and lively lover in Meiningen and finally in Brno, she married the engineer Emanuel Frieb (their daughter Lina became an opera singer) in 1839. After a break, she only appeared again in 1841 at the Wiedener and Carltheater in Vienna, where Moritz Gottlieb Saphir had recommended her. A guest performance by was the reason why the still young woman changed over to character studies and took over roles of mature women. During a guest performance in Vienna Theodor D√∂ring saw the actress in several older and comical roles. After his return, he arranged for Frieb-Blumauer to be invited to a rehearsal guest performance in Berlin, which she performed with great success. In 1854, she got a ten-year and later a lifelong contract with the royal playhouse. Among her pupils were Anita Augspurg, Olga Arendt, Agnes Freund and Anna Haverland.

Shem øon II probably selected his name in honour of the 4th-century patriarch Shem øon bar Sabba øe, a victim of the Forty Years' Persecution. Possibly he foresaw a similar period of persecution. His choice of name became very common thereafter. In view of the upheavals in Iraq in his time, it is unlikely that he was consecrated in Baghdad. Probably he was consecrated and resided in a monastery in northern Iraq. His reign fell in a period of intense persecution of Christians under the Timurid Empire. The 1390s saw a \\"flight to the mountains\\", as Nestorians took refuge from the upheavals in the region of Hakkari in northern Iraq.

History  Giacomo Muselli (1569-1641) came from a family of merchants and enjoyed an exceptionally secure economic status. He lived in the Bra district of Verona and appeared in the 1614 census aged 45. In the 1616 assessment he was rated in the top tax bracket. It is unclear when he began collecting, but in only a few decades he gathered around 150 high quality small and medium sized works. He remained attached to his collection, refusing to sell it to Francesco I d'Este and adding a provision in his will banning his children from lending works or having copies made of them. The collection included several works by Renaissance artists from Venice or of Venetian descent such as Veronese, Titian, Giovanni Bellini and Moretto da Brescia, along with works by 16th century German, Flemish and Dutch artists such as Civetta and Lucas Cranach the Elder) and the 17th century Veronese school. Alessandro Turchi works on canvas and touchstone were particularly strongly represented. It also included a small but important collection of drawings and prints, along with a bas-relief of The Judgement of Solomon by Giammaria Mosca (Louvre). The drawings included Man with a Pregnant Bitch by Parmigianino (a possible self-portrait) and Fall of Phaeton by Michelangelo (British Museum), acquired in Verona from the French banker and collector Pierre Crozat and on his death passing to the major drawings expert Pierre- Jean Mariette. The collection as a whole became an unmissable attraction for noblemen and artists who mentioned it in travel diaries and other works such as ‚ÄúMaraviglie dell'arte‚Äù (1648) by Carlo Ridolfi and ‚ÄúMicrocosmo della pittura‚Äù (1657) by Francesco Scannelli. Giacomo senior's two sons Cristoforo and Giovan Francesco kept the collection together in Verona in the face of much interest from potential Italian and foreign buyers such as Alfonso IV d'Este and his uncle Cesare d'Este (Francesco I's younger brother), perhaps more for its growing economic value than for family reasons or artistic appreciation. Of Cristoforo's three sons Girolamo, Giacomo and Paolo, it would be Giacomo and Paolo who finally sold the collection in 1685-1687 to Jean- Baptiste Colbert marquess of Seignelay (1651-1690), eldest son of Louis XIV's controller of finances Jean-Baptiste Colbert, with the French merchant Louis Alvarez and the painter Jean-Baptiste Forest acting as middlemen. On arrival in Paris the collection was split up into small lots and re-sold to Parisian collections such as that of Pierre Crozat, before soon moving onto Russian, German, Dutch and British collections. 17th-century Paris was an important market for the European art market in general and the dispersal of Veronese collections in particular.

The building is classified as a \\"Category I\\" (\\"places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\\") historic place by Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, previously known as the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.  History  The Government Buildings were designed by Government Architect, John Campbell primarily as a response to the request by the Lands and Survey Department for more and better space. Campbell also incorporated a new courthouse and space for other government departments. Contract plans for the first half of the building were completed in January 1908. While tenders for the building were being considered, a public subscription in Hokitika raised funds for a statue of Richard Seddon. Minister of Public Works William Hall-Jones requested that the Government Buildings be set back to allow the statue to be placed in front. Campbell agreed that the building be set back 20 feet (6.1m), although he did this to allow shrubs to be planted in front, as he did not consider the setback sufficient for the statue. The statue was however placed outside the partially completed Government Buildings and unveiled on 25 May 1910.  Construction and style  Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward, laid the foundation stone on 7 May 1908. Construction of the first half of the building, the main entrance and the left wing, was completed by 8 June 1909. Plans for the second half were not drawn up until November 1911. The second stage of the building contained the new courthouse. The original plans had contained both a Magistrates' Court on the ground floor and a Supreme Court above. However in 1911 the Supreme Court was moved to Greymouth, and so the plans were redrawn to contain a boardroom above the Magistrates' Court. The building was completed by end of 1913, and contained the Supreme Court, the Stipendiary Magistrate and Warden's Court, the office of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and offices for the Chief Surveyor, Education Board, and County Council. The building is constructed of banded brick and plaster in an Edwardian Imperial Baroque style. The Hokitika building is considered more restrained than some of Campbell's earlier designs, such as the Dunedin Law Courts. According to Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga, it was one of the key buildings which established Edwardian Baroque as the style of government architecture in New Zealand in the early part of this century.  Changing uses and ownership  The courtroom was closed in the 1970s due to restructuring by the then Department of Justice. The building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I item in June 1990, with registration number 5011. The building housed various government departments until the 1990s, but was sold by the government in 1994. In 2015, it was sold to three Auckland property investors, and then put on the market again in 2017. On the 26 September 2020, the building was purchased by Heritage New Zealand for $400,000. The New Zealand Government will invest $22 million from the Government‚Äôs $3 billion infrastructure fund in seismic strengthening and for the building to be refitted for use as offices for the Department of Conservation (DOC), which will lease the building.

Synopsis  The Craft of Science Writing presents more than 30 articles, some new, others previously published on The Open Notebook website, organized to answer five questions: \\"Who is a science journalist and how do you become one? What makes a science story and how do you find one? How do you report a science story? How do you tell your story? How do you build expertise in science writing?\\" In ALA's CHOICE, Melody Herr wrote that the articles are organized \\"into an introductory course that covers becoming a science journalist, identifying a story idea, conducting research, writing the story, and building proficiency in core skills\\". She also said the articles demonstrate effective idea presentation, \\"through personal anecdotes, interviews with award-winning journalists, expert panel discussions, and visuals, including a marked-up science article, a flowchart, and helpful checklists\\". Jonathan Wai wrote in Psychology Today, that it \\"...seeks to illuminate the craft of science writing by collecting numerous perspectives from science writers themselves about how to improve their own craft of science writing.\\" Carolyn Crist wrote the pieces \\"offer advice about how to pitch stories, evaluate scientific and statistical claims, report on controversial topics, and engage readers with a scientific story.\\"  Critical reception  Wai wrote, \\"The conversation among scientists themselves has not yet included learning from science writers and editors themselves, and thus this new volume, in my view, is important to read for scientists to understand what it is that science writers do, what it means to tell a great story about science, and the incentive structure that science writers are under especially as journalism is rapidly shifting.\\" The editor of Brontide Journal said,\\"It is the go to source for anyone who wants to write about science.

Maddox (January 29, 1899 - May 26, 1977) was a career officer in the United States Army. A 1920 graduate of the United States Military Academy, he was originally assigned to the Infantry branch and later transferred to Cavalry. A noted horseman, he took part in numerous equestrian shows as a member of U.S. Army teams and was also a member of numerous Army polo teams during the height of the sport's popularity in the 1920s. A veteran of World War II, Maddox served as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations (G-3) on the staff of General George S. Patton during Patton's command of Seventh and Third U.S. Armies during combat in North Africa and Europe. Maddox attained the rank of major general and was notable after World War II for his command of the 25th Infantry Division and Korean Military Advisory Group during the Korean War. He subsequently commanded the 9th Infantry Division and U.S. VII Corps. He later served as chief of staff and deputy commander of United States Army Europe, and his final assignment before retiring in 1959 was deputy commander of Second United States Army. After retiring from the military, Maddox served as assistant to the president of San Marcos Baptist Academy. He retired from this position in 1967 and was a resident of San Marcos, Texas. He died in there in 1977 and was buried at Saint Stephen's Episcopal Church Cemetery in Wimberley, Texas. Early life Halley Grey Maddox was born in McHenry, Kentucky on January 29, 1899, a son of Claude H. Maddox and Susan (Stewart) Maddox. He was raised and educated in Central City, Kentucky, and graduated from Hartford College, a two-year institution located in Hartford, Kentucky.

In July 1957, he was named deputy commander of U.S. Army Europe. In March 1958, Maddox was appointed deputy commander of United States Second Army at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, where he remained until retiring in January 1959. Later life In 1961, Maddox agreed to become assistant to the president of San Marcos Baptist Academy in San Marcos, Texas. Among his efforts to provide military training to the school's cadets was the creation of an annual drill and ceremony competition, which included participants from numerous high schools and military academies. Maddox remained on the academy staff until retiring in 1967. Maddox was also active in veterans and military retiree organizations in the San Marcos area, including participating in events to raise money for charity during Armed Forces Day celebrations. With the release of the film Patton in 1970, members of the news media asked to interview him. After screening the film, Maddox provided reporters with his impressions of the movie, which were generally favorable, and his recollections of his World War II service under Patton's command. Death and burial Maddox died in San Antonio, Texas on May 26, 1977. He was buried at Saint Stephen's Episcopal Church Cemetery in Wimberley, Texas. Awards Maddox's awards included the Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, and Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf cluster. He also received the French Legion of Honor, Croix de Guerre with Palm, and Medal of Metz. In addition, Maddox received the Czechoslovak War Cross and Order of the White Lion. His additional foreign decorations included the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and Luxembourg War Cross with Palm, and South Korea's Order of Military Merit (Taeguk). Family In 1922, Maddox married Bertalee Bernard Roemer (1892-1975), who had previously been married to Theodore M. Roemer. She was the mother of a daughter, Jean (b. 1920). They divorced after World War II, and in December 1949 Maddox married Madeleine (Ehrheart) Chace (1907-2006). She was the mother of two daughters, Madeleine and Sara.

Background Anarchism in Spain had been increasingly popular among workers' groups since in 1870s. The continual failure of general strikes as a tool for galvanizing change to working conditions disappointed many, and the advocacy for use of violence began to take hold. In Catalonia, radical anarchist sentiment was particularly strong and previous attacks had been carried out by against Arsenio Mart√≠nez Campos in September 1893 and by at the Liceu Theatre in November 1893. Both assailants were soon executed and in 1894 the government began an outright suppression of anarchism. Bombing A small group of anarchists originally planned to bomb the Corpus Christi procession on June 6, 1896, at Barcelona Cathedral. The group, led by Nogues Molas, abandoned the plot at the last minute, but another group convened the next day for the next stage of the procession. A single bomb was dropped from a building above on the procession as it passed through Carrer dels Canvis Nous street at 9 a.m. on June 7, 1896. Three congregants were killed instantly and many others were wounded. Another nine would die from their injuries in the following days. The identity of the perpetrator or perpetrators is disputed and remains controversial. Anarchists at the time denied any role in the bombing as its intended target, poorer working-class churchgoers, did not align with typical propaganda of the deed actions that targeted the rich bourgeoisie. Anti-clerical sentiments are found, however, in some late 19th century anarchist circles so the symbol of the Catholic Church could have been the intended target. Trade unionist and militant anarchist is the most commonly accepted perpetrator and was accused and tried for the attack, although he denied his role until a confession was obtained under torture in 1897. Some anarchists claimed that a French agitator, Fran√ßois Girault, later confessed to the attack before fleeing to Argentina. Aftermath The infamous Montju√Øc trials took place in 1897 where 87 alleged conspirators were accused and tried. Many of the detainees were outspoken against the use of violence and condemned the attack. Five defendants were sentenced to death and executed, including Ascheri, and another 67 were sentenced to imprisonment. While the sentences removed many prominent anarchist leaders from further activities, allegations of forced confessions and torture of defendants further radicalized other anarchists throughout Spain. In August 1897, Spanish Prime Minister Antonio C√°novas del Castillo was assassinated by anarchist Michele Angiolillo for his role in the Montju√Øc trials. Anarchist sentiment only hardened in Barcelona and 13 years after the Corpus Christi bombing, Barcelona workers staged a general strike in 1909 that was violently suppressed. Later, during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the epicenter of the brief Anarchist Catalonia state.

Black authors describe it as a voice in their heads that reminds them that their writing, characters, and plot choices are going to be judged by white readers, and that the reader or viewer, by default, is white.  Description  Toni Morrison, analyzing whiteness in American literature, said, \\"What happens to the writerly imagination of a black author who is at some level always conscious of representing one's race to, or in spite of, a race of readers that understands itself to be 'universal' or race-free?\\" In the documentary Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am, she calls it ‚ÄúThe little white man that sits on your shoulder and checks out everything you do or say.

Writer L J Alonge described it as \\"I'd try to write a scene about two kids trying to dine-and-dash, something I'd done, and stop to wonder if I was playing into narratives about \\"black criminality.\\" I'd try to write a scene about a kid getting into a fight, something else I'd done, and feel like I was fueling ideas about \\"black-on-black violence.\\"  Representations  The Pulitzer prize-winning play Fairview, by Jackie Sibblies Drury, focuses on the white gaze; the play's title is a play on the phrase. Hannah Miao, reviewing it, describes the White gaze as \\"being watched from a lens of otherness that is sometimes violently obvious, and sometimes so subtle that you find yourself wondering whether you made it up entirely. It is fetishization and repulsion, appropriation and persecution, misrepresentation and erasure, all at once.\\" A 2018 exhibit at California Institute of Integral Studies, White Gaze, investigated \\"the role of photography, and specifically the images of National Geographic, in reinforcing racist hierarchies in the cultural imaginary of the West\\".  In the US vs. in Africa  Dana Williams, president of the Toni Morrison society, noted that the concept was a Western construct, and that in the mid-20th century African writers wrote stories on their own terms.

It preserves fossils dating back to the late Cambrian to early Ordovician periods.Richardson 1904Mack 2004 Description The formation consists of ledge-forming brown to maroon medium- to coarse-grained sandstone; thinner beds of very fine-grained glauconitic sandstone;Paige 1916 and fine-grained sandstone interbedded with limestone or dolomite. A conglomerate bed is often present at the base and there are rare beds of oolitic ironstone. The formation lies unconformably on Precambrian basement rock except in the Florida Mountains, where it overlies Cambrian syenite and granite. The formation fills paleovalleys in the basement rock, and in some locations (such as the central Franklin Mountains and the west-central Florida Mountains) it is absent. It grades into the overlying El Paso Formation, with the contact placed either at the top of uppermost red or brown sandstone bed of the Bliss Formation or the base of the carbonate cliff characteristic of the El Paso Formation.Mack 2004, p.36 The formation straddles the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary, with the lower beds containing fossils of Trempealeauan age and the upper beds containing fossils of Skullrockian age.Taylor and Repetski 1995 The formation is interpreted as marine sediments deposited on a passive continental margin during a marine transgression advancing to the northeast.Mack 2004, p.40-42 Fossils The formation is locally bioturbated and contains fossils of the brachiopods Obolus, Lingulella, and Lingulepis acuminata. However, the formation has few macroscopic fossils useful for biostratigraphy. The best dated section is in the Flordillo Canyon in the central Caballo Mountains, which contains trilobite and conodont fossils that have helped determine its age. The lower beds are very scarce in fossils and difficult to date across the exposure area.Mack 2004, p.37 History of investigation The formation was first named by G.B.

He was in a holiday in Hy√®res, southern France, in 1932, when he took this photograph. He was influenced in his sense of composition by Cubist painting, in particular his lessons with French painter Andr√© Lhote, Surrealism, and the work of fellows photographers like Andr√© Kert√©sz. He positioned himself at the top of a staircase with his camera and waited for some activity to take place.

Cartier-Bresson loved the movement that set lines in motion and energised compositions. He often introduced mobile subjects into his compositions... By pressing the shutter release on his Leica, he stopped the movement, but at the same time he was able to produce images that, through their framing, composition and rhythm, still preserved the dynamism of the action.

He was elected to the Estonian Parliament and, in November 1924, senteced to life imprisonment in the Trial of the 149 due to the illegal nature of the Estonian Communist Party.Romuald J.

In prison Hendrik continued to edit illegal communist newspapers, such as the Vangimaja Kiir. However his imprisonment lasted only until 1938, when the president of Estonia, Konstantin P√§ts, pardoned the communists subsequently allowing for Hendrik's release. Following this Hendrik and other communists set up an underground organization from 1938 onwards.  The Great Patriotic War  Since the communists saw president P√§ts as a dictator, they planned to overtake the government. With the outbreak of World War II, Estonia was becoming a mere puppet state for the Soviet Union. On 21 June, 1940 a coup d'√©tat known as the \\"June Coup\\" () was organized and acted on, giving rise to the Estonian Communist Party. After the coup d'√©tat the Estonian SSR was founded and Hendrik was elected as the People's Commissariat of Trade and Industry, which he held until June 1941. When the German invasion of Soviet Union occurred in the summer of 1941, Hendrik moved to Russia. In 1942 he was appointed more roles in Estonia and became the political commissar of the 8th Estonian Rifle Corps, taking part in hostilities near Velikiye Luki, Nevel, and Novosokolniki.Johannes K√§bin: ‚ÄúPeople's Power‚Äù, Great October and Estonia , p. 91.

Synopsis  The story is told through letters, diary pages, and memories, and reveals elements of jealousy, grudges and taboo themes. It takes place in an old farm in the interior of Minas Gerais, which is visited by a woman. The story focuses on the decay of the Meneses family and depicts themes such as extramarital affairs, forbidden love, incestuous relationships, kinship, homosexuality, and violent acts. A decaying farmhouse in a provincial town in Minas Gerais is at the core of the action and becomes a major character. The plot is punctuated by sin, death and illness, and it shows the result of the presence of three brothers (Dem√©trio, Valdo and Tim√≥teo) and two wives (Ana and Nina). Nina is a stunningly beautiful woman who comes from Rio de Janeiro and is unable to adapt to rural, peasant life. She marries Valdo for his wealth, but soon discovers the decay of the Meneses family. As one of the main protagonists of the work, she is a destructive element of the family order and causes envy and disaffection in the family circle. She has an adulterous affair with Alberto, one of the servants who witness the events. From their relationship, Andr√© is born. Andr√© opens the book in a cyclic key: He is the character who retells Nina's death, so the story starts from the end of the chronology. The novel's plot and form are organized around the incest between mother and child, leaving the fictional truth open for the reader to unveil. Evaluation Cr√¥nica da casa assassinada is the best-known work by Brazilian novelist, poet and playwright L√∫cio Cardoso. According to researcher Mario Carelli (1951‚Äì1994), Cardoso's ‚Äúhuman and artistic path‚Äù comes together in this novel. It is considered the culmination of the writer's trajectory started in 1934 with Maleita, which is in tune with the dominant regionalist trend of the time. The novel leads to the psychological-existential path of Luz no Subsolo (1936), characterized by Carelli as a ‚Äúpassionate sketch‚Äù. This can also be seen in texts like the novel M√£os Vazias [Empty Hands] (1938), In√°cio (1944), and O Enfeiti√ßado [Bewitched] (1954).Carelli, Mario.

Critic Alfredo Bosi points out that the novel's theme is linked to religious and spiritualist issues, immersed in the formal freedom conquered by the vanguards in a ‚Äúdescent into the hell of anguish and guilt.‚ÄùBosi, Alfredo. Hist√≥ria concisa da literatura brasileira. 8th ed. S√£o Paulo: Cultrix, 1994. However, a difficulty persists in characterizing it in one of the currents of the Brazilian novel. The complex combination of literary characteristics does not allow reducing it to the idea of an ‚Äúintrospective novel‚Äù or to the trends developed by the critics mentioned above. The reader is faced with the narrative unfolded between psychological turbulence and the portrait of a decaying social order. Or between the production of ‚Äúspectral portraits of being‚Äù, as suggested by the poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade in a tribute poem to Cardoso (\\"A L√∫cio Cardoso, na casa de sa√∫de\\" [To L√∫cio Cardoso, in a sanatorium]),B√°rbara Del Rio Ara√∫jo, \\"Cr√¥nicas da Casa Assassinada: reflex√µes acerca do espa√ßo liter√°rio e de leitura\\", Revista Leitura, vol. 2, no. 54 (July‚ÄìDecember 2014), pp. 38‚Äì50. and the exhibition of the ‚Äúmoral metastasis of the Meneses farm‚Äù, in the words of the critic Eduardo Portella.Portella, Eduardo. A linguagem prometida. In: Cardoso, L√∫cio; Carelli, Mario (ed.). Cr√¥nica da casa assassinada. Edi√ß√£o cr√≠tica. Madri: Archivos, 1991. The novel is also considered a transition from the modern to the postmodern society, since \\"the story narrated in the novel is distinguished by the decline of traditional values and by the consequent rise of anarchic proposals that justify the nihilism of contemporary society.\\"M√≠rian dos Santos, Rog√©rio Lobo S√°ber. \\"Cr√¥nica da casa assassinada e a metaforiza√ß√£o dos discursos moderno e p√≥s-moderno.\\" Akr√≥polis Umuarama, v. 18, no. 2 (April‚ÄìJune 2010), pp. 115‚Äì130. In a non-linear way, the novel describes the decadence and fragmentation of a traditional bourgeois Brazilian family in a multilayered narrative which includes the voices of members of the Meneses family and of the inhabitants of Vila Velha, the town where they live.

An indefatigable fighter, during his long career he joined or led numerous military campaigns all over France and beyond. He served the French Valois kings Charles VII, Louis XI and Charles VIII, but also participated in two aristocratic uprisings, the Praguerie against Charles VII in 1440 and the War of the Public Weal in 1465 against Louis XI. Associated early in his life with the Armagnac faction, he fought in Charles VII's campaigns against England, including those involving Joan of Arc, and (except for a troubled period in the early 1460s) also remained generally opposed to the Burgundians and their Habsburg successors. 18th-century scholar Charles Pinot Duclos described him as \\"one of the bravest men of his time, sincere, faithful, quick-tempered, a keen friend and implacable enemy\\" (un des plus braves hommes de son temps, sinc√®re, fid√®le, naturellement emport√©, ami vif et implacable ennemi). called him \\"the most experienced general of his era\\" (le g√©n√©ral le plus exp√©riment√© de son si√®cle). His reputation has been tainted by his late-1430s freebooting √©corcheur raids and by his avidity in appropriating properties of the disgraced Jacques Coeur in the early 1450s, mainly the lordship of Puisaye which Coeur's successors tried to reclaim in legal procedures that extended beyond Chabannes's lifetime. His rule in Puisaye, however, coincided with the revival of that region following the ravages of the Hundred Years' War and the broader Crisis of the Late Middle Ages. Family and early life quartering of Chabannes (de gueules au lion d'hermine, arm√©, couronn√© et lampass√© d'or) and Dammartin (fasc√© d'argent et d'azur √† la bordure de gueules), with escutcheon quartering of Toucy (d'or √† trois pals de vair, au chef d'or charg√© de quatre merlettes de gueules) and S√©v√©rac (d'argent √† quatre pals de gueules). In other occurrences, Antoine de Chabannes put the arms of the House of Ch√¢tillon, ancestors of his wife, in escutcheon. The Chabannes were an aristocratic family established in the Limousin since the 13th century. Antoine's father Robert de Chabannes, lord of Charlus-le-Pailhoux (now in Saint-Exup√©ry-les-Roches), died at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and his elder brother Etienne de Chabannes died at the Battle of Cravant in 1423, where 15-year-old Antoine fought as well. Following this succession of events, the family estates went to his brother . Antoine was left to assemble properties and titles on his own, which he kept doing throughout his long life. Service to Charles VII Antoine de Chabannes was involved from a young age in the intrigues and fights of the embattled king Charles VII, associating himself with commanders La Hire and Xaintrailles. He was captured at the Battle of Verneuil but, given his youth, was freed without ransom by the Duke of Bedford. He then served Duke Charles I of the House of Bourbon as a page until 1426. The contemporary chronique martinienne observes of him at that time that \\"he was inclined towards fighting and keen to acquire honour and properties\\" (tant il avait le coeur aux armes et envie d'acqu√©rir honneurs et biens). By 1428, 20-year-old Antoine de Chabannes fought alongside Joan of Arc in battles including Jargeau, Patay (where he led the vanguard and was wounded), and the Siege of Compi√®gne where Joan was captured in May 1430. In the meantime he had participated in the March to Reims and attended the epic coronation (sacre) of Charles VII, on 17 July 1429. In the summer of 1429, Charles VII made him bailiff of Troyes, and in 1432, Captain of Creil, a stronghold loyal to Charles surrounded by hostile territory. In 1434, he was wounded in a bold attack on Old Talbot near Beaumont-sur-Oise. On 12 November 1437, he was with Charles VII at the latter's ceremonial entry into Paris, a major symbolic moment following the 1435 Treaty of Arras that put an end to the most chaotic period of the Hundred Years' War. Ruins of the castle of Montaigu-le-Blin, a base of Antoine de Chabannes in the late 1430s He spent most of the late 1430s leading his own band of soldiers, as one of the most prominent √©corcheurs as they were labeled in contemporary chronicles, especially Burgundian ones: literally \\"flayers\\", referring to their practices of robbing and ransoming. Many of his freebooting raids were directed at lands of the Duke of Burgundy such as Hainaut, Cambr√©sis and Charolais, typically condoned by the king despite the stipulations of the Peace of Arras. Antoine de Chabannes also fought for the Duke of Bourbon, who made him Captain of Chavroches in 1438, and as part of royal operations, such as the siege of Meaux in 1439 led by Constable of France Arthur de Richemont. He occasionally let himself and his troops be hired as mercenaries, most notably for Antoine de Vaud√©mont against Ren√© of Anjou in 1438-39. He also used castles of the Chabannes family as his bases, such as the where he kept the lord of Pesmes prisoner in 1439. The grey area in which Antoine de Chabannes operated during those years, a hybrid of unsupervised banditry and royal service, is illustrated by a chronicler's story that Charles VII once saluted him ironically as \\"capitaine des √©corcheurs\\", to which his reply was \\"Sire, I only flayed your enemies, and methinks their skins will bring you more profit than to me; I never flayed anybody else\\" (Sire, je n'ai √©corch√© que vos ennemis, et il me semble que leurs peaux vous feront plus de profit qu'√† moi ; je n'en √©corchai jamais d'autres). Castle of Dammartin-en-Go√´le northeast of Paris, entirely rebuilt in brick by Antoine de Chabannes's and later destroyed by Cardinal Richelieu in 1632 On 20 September 1439 Antoine de Chabannes married Marguerite de Nanteuil, Countess of Dammartin-en-Go√´le, to whom he had been recommended by the king. The marriage brought him the County of Dammartin as her dowry. In 1440, he was one of the leaders of the Praguerie against Charles VII, and kept associating with the Dauphin Louis's actions in the following years, such as the Siege of Dieppe in 1442-43 and an expedition to support Sigismund of Habsburg against the Swiss, including the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs near Basel where he fought furiously. Charles VII made him conseiller du roi in 1444, then Grand Panetier of France in 1445 (and again in 1447), after he had forced him and other warlords of the Hundred Years' War to dismiss their bands of soldiers as he strived to establish a standing army. On that occasion, Antoine de Chabannes wore mourning clothes, telling the king that he was \\"taking life away from him by separating him from his soldiers\\" (Sire, vous m'√¥tez la vie d'√©loigner mes gens d'armes de moi, avec lesquels j'ai v√©cu vingt ans sans reproche et sans faire de faute). Antoine de Chabannes eventually broke with Louis in September 1446, by revealing to Charles VII the Dauphin's intrigues against Pierre de Br√©z√©, and beyond against the king himself. This episode led to Louis's temporary banishment to the Dauphin√©, upon which Louis swore that he would \\"take revenge against those who threw me out of my house\\", meaning Chabannes. Ch√¢teau de Blanquefort near Bordeaux, restored by Antoine de Chabannes in the late 1450s In 1449, he was with the king in the reconquest of Normandy, and in 1451 fought in Guyenne where he reconquered from the English the Ch√¢teau de Blanquefort near Bordeaux, nominally part of Marguerite de Nanteuil's dowry but out of her family's hands for 160 years. That castle was retaken by England later in 1451, and reconquered again by Chabannes in 1453. Charles VII confirmed his ownership of it in 1455 but Louis XI took it back in 1466. Also in 1451, Antoine de Chabannes was appointed to chair the committee that investigated and led to the downfall of Jacques Coeur. He promptly appropriated a number of Coeur's properties including his recently acquired lordship of Puisaye. Charles VII's decision of 29 May 1453 specifically granted him: \\"(1) the lands, castles and lordships of Saint-Fargeau, of Lavau, of La Couldre, of Perreuse, of Champignelles, of M√©zilles, or Villeneuve-les-Gen√™ts and their dependencies; (2) the lands of Saint-Maurice-sur-Aveyron, Melleroy, La Frenaie, Fontenelles, and their dependencies; (3) the Barony of Toucy with its belongings and dependencies.\\" Between 1453 and 1455 he further secured ownership of the Puisaye domains by purchasing them in auction. Castle of S√©v√©rac, awarded by the king to Antoine de Chabannes in 1455 for his service in Rouergue In October 1453, he received the command of soldiers of his brother Jacques, who had died from his wounds at the Battle of Castillon. He then led a campaign in 1454 against John V, Count of Armagnac on the king's behalf, jointly with Jean Bureau, for which he was awarded a number of lands in Rouergue and Languedoc including the lordship of S√©v√©rac. In 1455-56 he was sent to Lyon, Savoy and the Dauphin√© to put an end to the Dauphin Louis's machinations, prompting the latter's flight to the court of Burgundy. In 1458, he and Jean d'Aulon jointly led a successful embassy to Duke Louis of Savoy and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy to avert war between France and them both. in 1461, he stayed with Charles VII at the Ch√¢teau de Mehun-sur-Y√®vre until the king's death on July 22. Service to Louis XI and Charles VIII Ch√¢teau de Saint-Fargeau, rebuilt by Antoine de Chabannes from 1467 as his main stronghold in the Puisaye On succeeding Charles VII in 1461, Louis XI was initially hostile to Antoine de Chabannes, banished him from the kingdom, then upon his voluntary return from the Holy Roman Empire in August 1462 imprisoned him briefly in the Conciergerie and then in the Louvre. Following a hearing on 20 August 1463, Chabannes received a death sentence from the Parliament of Paris, which was commuted by the king into perpetual banishment to Rhodes, then after a change of mind, imprisonment in the Bastille. Meanwhile, Louis XI had the Puisaye domains returned to Jacques Coeur's son Geoffroy, and Chabannes's other properties granted to his rivals Charles de Melun, Jean de Montespedon and Antoine de Chateauneuf. The ever-resourceful Chabannes, however, managed to escape from the Bastille in early March 1465 and joined the so-called League of the Public Weal against the king. That conflict was swiftly resolved following the Treaty of Conflans, of which he was one of the main negotiators. At the request of the League's princely members, the treaty included a specific clause by which Louis XI gave back to Antoine de Chabannes all his former domains. In February 1467, the king further made him the Grand Master of France, in replacement of his former nemesis Charles de Melun (who ended up decapitated the next year), and in August 1468 finally annulled his 1463 conviction. However, the legal procedures with the Coeur family over the Puisaye domains lingered on until a final settlement in 1489, shortly after Antoine de Chabannes's death. Front page of the statute of the Order of Saint Michael, ca. 1470, depicting Antoine de Chabannes talking to the king (7th from left, with blue hat and holding a ceremonial baton) In 1468, Chabannes decisively refused to demobilize the royal troops assembled in Noyon despite a written order Louis had signed under duress in P√©ronne, which fully regained him the King's confidence. He had the honor of being among the Order of Saint Michael's first cohort of 15 knights in August 1469, confirming his return to the inner core of the French royal court. In late 1469 he was sent by Louis XI to pacify the Guyenne and Armagnac, leading John V of Armagnac to flee across the border to Hondarribia, and gained additional lands in Rouergue as reward from the king. In the early 1470s he led royal military campaigns together with Louis of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, always under tight instructions from Louis XI. In 1470 he took Amiens from Burgundy. In 1472 he was made Military governor of Paris, and participated in the defense of Beauvais against Charles the Bold. In December 1474, he had the honor of hosting the king and the royal court in his castle of Dammartin. On 29 August 1475, he attended the meeting of Picquigny between Louis XI and Edward IV of England, which undermined the Anglo-Burgundian alliance and marked the formal end of the Hundred Years' War. Following Charles the Bold's death in January 1477, still fit to lead militery operations despite his advanced age, he raided Flanders during the War of the Burgundian Succession. He then held the frontline stronghold of Le Quesnoy for more than a year. Louis XI, heowever, replaced him there with in June 1478 as part of a truce in which the king relinquished Hainaut to Maximilian, and episode that crystallized a new deterioration of Chabannes's relationship with the king. In the spring of 1479, Louis XI relieved him of his military command, even though he kept his pension and other titles, and was still occasionally called for advice. In 1483, some of his domains in Rouergue were granted by Louis to the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, a gift that survives to this day in the President of France being an honorary canon there. Chabannes was indemnified, however, and kept S√©v√©rac on his coat of arms. Following Louis XI's death, Antoine de Chabannes was back in favor under the young Charles VIII, who on 23 October 1483 reappointed him captain and governor of S√©v√©rac. At the Estates General in Tours, in February 1484, he was sitting on the bench to the king's right, together with Jean IV de Rieux and Louis II de la Tr√©moille. In 1485, he further increased his domains by purchasing the barony of Courtenay, just north of the Puisaye. In his last years, he lived mainly in his castles of Dammartin-en-Go√´le and Saint-Fargeau, with occasional Parisians stays in his h√¥tel de Beautreillis, part of the former royal palace of H√¥tel Saint-Pol whose name survives in the . He was again made Military governor of Paris by the regent Anne of France. He maintained an active written correspondence with the king, who appears to have valued his advice. Death and legacy Church of Our Lady in Dammartin-en-Go√´le (before restoration in 2017) Antoine de Chabannes died on Christmas Day 1488. He was buried in the collegiate church of Our Lady (Coll√©giale Notre-Dame) in Dammartin-en-Go√´le, which he had built from 1480, following a wish he had made in 1463 while imprisoned in the Bastille, on the site of a chapel that had been destroyed during the War of the Public Weal. The church had been consecrated by the Bishop of Meaux on 18 February 1488, less than a year before Chabannes's death. The still-extant monumental tomb displays an idealized youth portrait of him as a gisant with a phoenix bird at his feet, which may refer to eternal life but also to the ups and downs of his long career. The tomb was opened and restored in 1804, as related by a commemorative plaque which is now placed in front of it. The inscription on the rim of the lid reads: \\"Cy gist noble et puissant seigneur messire anthoine de chabannes, ch[eva]l[ie]r de l'ordre du Roy n[ot]r[e] s[ir]e, en son vivant comte de dampmartin baron de toussy et du tour en Champaigne, et seignieur de saint fargeau de saint morise de courtenay et du pays de puisaye, et grand maistre d'ostel de France ; Et fut premier fond[at]eur du chapitre et coli√®ge de l'√©glise de c√©ans, le quel tr√©passa le jour de No√´l de l'an de grace mil CCCC.IIIIxx et huit : Dieu lui face pardon √† l'√¢me et √† tous aultres trespass√©s.

Until the 17th century, the corresponding location inside the church was adorned with a small monument and an epitaph that read \\"Antoine de Chabannes, / Mort suis sans trahison / Mais bien aimant raison / Conte et aussi grant mestre. / Dieu me mettre en bon estre ! / J'aimai loyaut√© / Qui m'a toujours port√©, / Tant qu'au monde ait est√© ; / D'ennemi non vaincu / D'ans IIIIxx [80] j'ai vescu, / On le sait, de trois roys non reprint. / Sur ce point, Dieu m'a print.\\" The metal chest that contained the heart was later relocated to a chapel within the same church, in which Antoine de Chabannes's son had also erected an equestrian statue of him, probably destroyed in 1793. He was succeeded as Count of Dammartin-en-Go√´le by his only surviving son John (Jean de Chabannes), born in 1462, who had already been calling himself Lord of Saint-Fargeau since 1470. Antoine's direct male line became extinct at Jean's death in 1503. In 1554, the County of Dammartin was purchased by Constable Anne de Montmorency, and remained in the House of Montmorency, then (after the 1632 execution of Henri II de Montmorency, which also led to the Dammartin castle's destruction) of Bourbon-Cond√© until the French Revolution. The domains in Puisaye were soon divided between Saint-Fargeau, which went to the Houses of Anjou-M√©zi√®res and then of Bourbon-Montpensier, and Toucy, which remained in the local family of Prie. Other branches of the Chabannes family survive to this day. =In popular culture= Antoine de Chabannes features in Le Spectre de Ch√¢tillon, a 1855 novel by √âlie Berthet.

Emperor Otto I founded the Diocese of Brandenburg here in 948 on top of an older Slavic fortress. The original settlement was probably lost in the Slavic revolt of 983. The Diocese of Brandenburg was restored in 1161 as part of the successful eastward expansion of the Holy Roman Empire and the previous establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear in 1157. The laying of the foundation stone for the initial Romanesque construction was documented in 1165. The building was planned as a single-nave, cross-shaped Romanesque Saalkirche made of brick. The plans were expanded to a three-aisled basilica with two west towers and an elevated choir. A crypt, open towards the main nave, was added under the choir. The double tower design was reduced to a single north tower and a stump of the south tower, likely due to lack of money or unstable soil. The western front is supported by attached buttresses on the outside. The Gothic expansion was completed around the middle of the 15th century. It is the oldest pure brick building in the state of Brandenburg with a reliable construction date and is often referred to as ‚Äúthe cradle of the Mark Brandenburg‚Äù. Following the Reformation, the Roman Catholic diocese of Brandenburg lost the cathedral and it became Protestant. Today, the church parish belongs to the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia. The interior is characterized by white walls with accented red bands along arches, windows and ribbed vaults. The main arches along the nave are rounded in the older Romanesque style whereas the ribbed vaults and windows are in later pointed Gothic style. The church is richly decorated with works of art from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. There are several elaborate stone epitaphs for local clergymen and dukes. The wooden pulpit contains elaborate carvings with floral motifs and colored statues of Peter and Paul. The triptych ‚ÄúBohemian Altar‚Äù contains carved figures of a coronation of Mary and four saints in the center flanked by twelve saints each on a golden background. It can be dated to 1375 and is connected with the visit of Emperor Charles IV to Brandenburg, when he donated valuable relics to the cathedral. The cathedral monastery archive is the oldest archive east of the river Elbe and contains the document with the first mention of the city of Berlin in 1244. The main church organ by local organ builder Joachim Wagner was installed in 1725. It has been preserved almost entirely in its original condition.

Biography Simon Kahquados was born on May 18, 1851, in Black Earth, a Potawatomi village located in the present-day Town of Carlton, Wisconsin. His father died in 1856, and he was raised by his grandfather near Whitefish Bay, Door County. In 1862, the Potawatomi in Door County and Kewaunee County were forced from their land and became refugees, dividing into small bands and moving to northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Kahquados was in a band that moved into the Upper Peninsula in 1864, where he hunted and trapped. In 1870, his family bought a homestead in Bark River, Michigan, where he associated with the Hannahville Methodist Indian Mission and worked as a logger in the timber industry. Unlike Native Americans who had moved west of the Mississippi River, bands of Potawatomi that remained in northern Wisconsin and Michigan did not receive annuities from the United States government. In the early 20th century, Kahquados made several trips to Washington, D.C., to lobby the government to improve conditions for the Potawatomi people and return their land. Although he did not achieve his goal of regaining the land in Kewaunee County where he was born, his actions played a significant role in the organization and federal recognition of the Forest County Potawatomi Community in 1913. In pressing his cause, Kahquados spoke with many historians and scholars and gave speeches at public events, including the Wisconsin State Fair. The information he gave Wisconsin historians and writers continues to be an important source of historical information about Potawatomi culture. After the establishment of the Forest County Potawatomi Community, Kahquados lived in Marinette County, Wisconsin, before finally settling with a friend in Blackwell, Wisconsin. He spent his final years battling illness and living in poverty on a government annuity of $10 per month. He died on November 27, 1930. Initially buried in northern Wisconsin, his last wishes were to be buried near the grave of his ancestor Chief Onanguisse in Peninsula State Park, Door County, Wisconsin. Over 15,000 people attended his reburial ceremony at the park on May 30, 1931.

The sun's image appears about a half degree above its real position during sunset due to Earth's atmospheric refraction. In 1998, NASA astrophysicist Yu Wang from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the first time proposed to use the Earth as an atmospheric lens. Wang suggests in his paper that: > If we could build a space telescope using the Earth's atmosphere as an > objective lens the aperture of such space telescope would be the diameter of > the earth. Telescope resolution could be enhanced by up to seven orders of > magnitude and would enable detailed images of planets in far away stellar > systems. If built, the terrestrial atmospheric lens would become the largest telescope ever built. Its high resolution would allow to directly image nearby Earth- like planets with a level of detail never seen before. As of September 2020, the main observation targets are Proxima b, located 4.2 light years away, Tau Ceti e, 12 light years away, and Teegarden b, also located 12 light years away.

Inhabited by Native Americans for several hundred years, Black Earth was one of Wisconsin's Potawatomi communities that continued to exist in the decades after many Potawatomi left Wisconsin under the terms of the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. In January 1852, Andrew J. Vieau and his wife, Rebecca, acquired the deed to the property and began granting land to individual tribe members. In 1858, John Axtell learned the Natives were not paying taxes for their property. Without the Potawatomis' knowledge, he took out a tax lien against their holdings in Black Earth and began paying their taxes in order to acquire legal ownership of the land. By 1862, he owned the land and took action to forcibly remove the Native Americans with assistance from a group of approximately 15 other white men. As many as 1,000 people were displaced and became refugees, dividing into small bands and moving to northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Tens of thousands of bungalows were built in the Chicago area in the early twentieth century, as their affordability made them popular with the working class. Many of Berwyn's bungalows were purchased by Czech Americans, who moved to Berwyn in great numbers in the 1920s and accounted for 25% of the city's population by 1930.

He served as mayor of Dunedin from 1915 to 1919. Biography Born in Riverton in 1870, Clark was the youngest son of Presbyterian minister Reverend James Clark, and his wife, Margaret Munro Clark. A few months later, the family moved to Palmerston. Clark moved to Dunedin in 1895, where he remained for the rest of his life. Clark was first elected as a Dunedin city councillor in 1909. He became mayor in 1915, and was the first person to hold the office for four consecutive years. He remained on the city council until 1921, when he did not seek re-election, but again served as a city councillor from 1923 until 1933. Clark twice stood as the Reform Party candidate for the Dunedin North parliamentary seat. In the 1922 Dunedin North by-election, he finished second, 120 votes behind the Labour candidate, Jim Munro. He stood again at the 1922 general election, but once again lost to Munro, this time by 55 votes. Other public bodies on which Clark served included the Dunedin Drainage Board, the Ocean Beach Domain Board, the Dunedin Hospital and Charitable Aid Board, and the board of governors of the King Edward Technical College. He was a member of the Otago Patriotic Association from its foundation, serving as its president during his term as Dunedin mayor, and was also a member of the National War Funds Council. Clark was a prominent Freemason, and was grand master of the New Zealand Grand Lodge in 1929. He was also active in cricket administration, serving as president of both the Otago Cricket Association and the New Zealand Cricket Council. In the 1918 New Year Honours, Clark was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and the following year he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services in connection with patriotic undertakings, in the 1919 King's Birthday Honours.

His goal was to reunify Central America with himself as President. He died in battle on 2 April 1885 and peace was reached on 14 April.  Background  The Federal Republic of Central America formed in 1821 after declaring independence from the First Mexican Empire. The First Central American Civil War solidified the nation's existence under Francisco Moraz√°n from 1826 to 1829, but the Second Central American Civil War tore the country apart from 1838 to 1841. In April 1871, two Guatemalan Divisional Generals, Miguel Garc√≠a Granados and Justo Rufino Barrios, overthrew President Vicente Cerna y Cerna. Garc√≠a Granados replaced Cerna y Cerna as President, but he retired in 1873 and was succeeded by Barrios. He was a firm supporter of Central American reunification and he wanted to make himself President of a reunited Central America. He was inspired by Otto von Bismarck successfully uniting Germans under Prussia. He wished to do the same; unite Central Americans under Guatemala.  War  = Declaration of unification = On 28 February 1885, Barrios gave a speech where he declared himself President of Central America. He declared he had supreme authority over all the nations of Central America: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The National Assembly of Guatemala held a session on 5 March and the legislature approved Barrios' declaration. Barrios believed all the other Central American nations would be enthusiastic to join Guatemala to recreate a Central American union, but instead, only Honduras accepted his declaration on 7 March. The other three nations, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, all denounced the declaration and wished to remain independent. = Mexican involvement = Barrios began mobilizing the Guatemalan Army on 10 March and began moving his soldiers to the Salvadoran border on 23 March. He threatened military force and thought that the threat of military action would make El Salvador submit, however, Salvadoran President Rafael Zald√≠var began preparing his own army to defend against Barrios' invasion force. El Salvador called for assistance from Mexico to distract the Guatemalans while they prepared their army. President Porfirio D√≠az mobilized an army of 15,000 soldiers along the Guatemalan border, and in response, Barrios had 1,500 soldiers stationed on the border under the command of Manuel Barillas to defend from a Mexican invasion. The Guatemalans attempted to negotiate with the Mexicans through the United States' ambassador to Guatemala, Batres Jauregui. The negotiations succeeded and D√≠az demobilized his soldiers, stating that the measures were for self-defense purposes. = Invasion of El Salvador = On 31 March, Barrios marched his soldiers into Guatemalan territory and the first target to capture was the town of Chalchuapa. The Salvadorans defended the town with a garrison of 5,000 soldiers under the command of Ad√°n Mora. The Guatemalans waged a battle from 1 to 2 April but the defensive forces stood their ground. Barrios was killed during the battle with reports claiming he was either shot in the heart by a Salvadoran soldier and fell off his horse or that he was shot in the back by a Guatemalan soldier who accidentally shot him. After Barrios was killed, one of his military officers, Felipe Cruz, took command of the army. He attempted to keep waging battle, but due to falling morale, he had his forces retreat. = Peace = Zald√≠var attempted to seek peace but Cruz initially refused. Honduras and Nicaragua agreed to peace on 11 April while Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica came to peace on 14 April.  Aftermath  After Barrios' death, Alejandro M. Sinibaldi became President of Guatemala, who was then succeeded by Barillas in 1886. Zald√≠var was overthrown on 22 June by Francisco Men√©ndez. Costa Rican President Pr√≥spero Fern√°ndez Oreamuno died in office during the war and was succeeded by Bernardo Soto Alfaro.

Between 2006 and 2010, Russia was the only contracting state to refuse to ratify Protocol 14. In 2010, Russia ended its opposition to the protocol, in exchange for a guarantee that Russian judges would be involved in reviewing complaints against Russia. Protocol 14 led to reforms in three areas: The court's filtering capacity was reinforced to deal with clearly inadmissible applications, new admissibility criteria were introduced so that cases where the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage would be declared inadmissible, and measures were introduced to deal more effectively with repetitive cases. Protocol 14 amended the convention so that judges would be elected for a non-renewable term of nine years, whereas previously judges served a six-year term with the option of renewal. Amendments were also made so that a single judge could reject plainly inadmissible applications, while prior to this protocol only a three judge committee could make this final decision. In cases of doubt, the single judge refers the applications to the Committee of the Court. A single judge may not examine applications against the state which nominated him. The three judge committee has jurisdiction to declare applications admissible and decide on the merits of the case if it was well founded and based on well established case law. Previously the three judge committee could only declare the case inadmissible, but could not decide on the merits of the case, which could only be done by a chambers of seven judges or the Grand Chamber. Protocol 14 also provides that when a three judge committee decides on the merits of a case, the judge elected to represent that state is no longer a compulsory member of this committee. The judge can be invited by the committee, to replace one of its members, but only for specific reasons, such as when the application relates to the exhaustion of national legal remedies. Protocol 14 empowered the court to declare applications inadmissible where the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage and which do not raise serious questions affecting the application or the interpretation of the convention, or important questions concerning national law. The European Commissioner for Human Rights is now allowed to intervene in cases as a third party, providing written comments and taking part in hearings. In order to reduce the workload of the court, Protocol 14 states that the court should encourage the parties to reach a settlement at an early stage of the proceedings, especially in repetitive cases. The Committee of Ministers supervises the settlement's execution. Protocol 14 also allows the Committee of Ministers to ask the court to interpret a final judgment if there are difficulties in the execution of a final judgment. In order to prevent repetitive applications concerning structural problems in contracting states on which the court has previously made a final decision, the Committee of Ministers can in exceptional circumstances and with a two-thirds majority, initiate proceedings for non-compliance with a final decision in the Grand Chamber of the court. Article 17 of protocol 14 allows the European Union to become party to the convention. In turn the Lisbon Treaty, which entered force in December 2009, provides that the European Union should accede and become a party to the convention. The Committee of Ministers is to evaluate in 2012 to 2015 the extent to which the implementation of Protocol 14 has improved the effectiveness of the court. The Committee of Ministers is to decide before 2019 whether more reforms of the court are necessary.

The bills are viewed by some as undermining human rights and the rule of law, and has been the subject of significant controversy in Samoa. Background Samoan law stems from two sources: English common law, as ultimately embodied in the Constitution of Samoa, and Samoan customary law, such as Fa ªamatai. The latter is dominant in two areas: land ownership and use, and village governance under the Village Fono Act 1990. 80% of land in Samoa is held as customary land, with title formally vested in matai. Disputes over this land - for example, over boundaries or ownership - are decided by the Land and Titles Court according to Samoan custom. While appeals are nominally forbidden,Land and Titles Act 1981, s71 the Supreme Court of Samoa exercises a supervisory jurisdiction for breaches of fundamental rights. Decisions of the Land Court - and ultimately, local matai - over titles have been overturned by the Supreme Court for breach of the right to a fair trial. The Land and Titles Court has been the subject of criticism for a number of years due to ongoing delays, verbal-only rulings, poor process, and outright bias. In 2016, the Samoan Parliament commissioned a Special Inquiry Committee to review the Court and improve its processes. The Committee recommended a number of improvements, including written rulings and conflict of interest provisions.Tuimavave (2017), Appendix 1. One of the recommendations was that the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court be retained to ensure the fundamental rights of Samoan citizens are upheld.Tuimavave (2017), p13 - 14. Village governance is conducted according to custom by meetings (fono) of matai conducted under the Village Fono Act. In addition to local government functions such as sanitation and economic development, and punishment of low-level village misconduct, fono are empowered to make decision on issues such as harmony, promoting social cohesion, protecting Samoan customs and traditions, and safeguarding village traditions, norms and protocols,Village Fono Act 1990, s5. and are empowered to issue punishments such as fines, work, or banishment.Village Fono Act 1990, s6. These powers are sometimes abused, for example to fine or banish political candidates or their supporters, or followers of minority religious groups. These decisions have also been overturned by the Supreme Court on human rights grounds, and the Court has consistently upheld the constitutional right to freedom of religion over village decisions. Provisions The Bill would repeal the existing Land and Titles Act 1981 and replace it with a new regime. The Land and Titles Court would be retained, but appeals to the Supreme Court of Samoa and Court of Appeal of Samoa would be forbidden, instead being handled by a new \\"Land and Titles High Court\\" and \\"Land and Titles Court of Appeal and Review\\".Land and Titles Bill 2020, part 5. Appeals heard by the land and Titles Court under the Village Fono Act 1990 would also be redirected.Land and Titles Bill 2020, s66. The Constitution Amendment Bill 2020 and Judicature Bill 2020 make subsidiary changes to the Constitution of Samoa and Samoan court system to enable the changes to the land and Title Court system to occur. The constitutional amendments remove the jurisdiction of Samoa's civil and criminal courts over issues within the jurisdiction of the Land and Titles Court, and establish the new Land and Titles Court appellate divisions. As at present, decisions of the land and Titles Court would be made according to customary law, but a clause specifically states that \\"The English common law and equity of England does not apply in the Land and Titles Court\\"Constitution Amendment Bill 2020, s7, new s104A(8). According to its Explanatory Memorandom, one of the purposes of the Bill is to prevent the decisions of Village Fonos from being overridden by the courts for infringing on human rights. A version of the bill was first introduced to the Samoan Parliament in January 2019. An updated version of the bill was reintroduced on 17 March 2020. After being passed through Parliament to its third reading under the state of emergency declared due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, progress on the Bill was halted to allow consideration by a special select committee and consultation with local villages. In August 2020 the Committee's consideration on the Bill was extended. Controversy The Bill and its related legislation has resulted in significant controversy, and been condemned both within Samoa and internationally. In April 2020 the Samoa Law Society expressed concern about the bill being passed under urgency through Parliament, without any of the required public consultation. Samoa's judiciary also expressed \\"grave concerns\\" with the proposed constitutional amendments, via a letter from the Acting Chief Justice Vui Clarence Nelson and co-signed by all judges of the Supreme and District Courts. In May 2020 Samoa's Ombudsman Maiava Iulai Toma formally expressed opposition to the Bills in a submission to Parliament, saying that it threatened freedom of religion. The United Nations special rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers in an open letter to the Samoan government said that new provisions relating to the dismissal of judges would breach international standards on judicial independence and would violate article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has also been condemned by Amnesty International and the New Zealand Law Society. Opposition to the Bill has led to the resignation of three MPs from the Human Rights Protection Party: Laauli Leuatea Polataivao in May, Faumuina Asi Pauli Wayne Fong in July, and Deputy Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa in September. Mata'afa later denounced the Bill as undermining the rule of law. Supporters of the bills view them as embedding Samoan values in the constitution, and explicitly disagreed with the constitution's protection of human rights. On 24 September 2020 Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi criticised opponents of the bills, and declared that they are \\"not Samoan\\".

C. Sleigh and Company, involved in shipping and petroleum distribution, best known for their \\"Golden Fleece\\" products and service stations.  History  Harold Crofton Sleigh was born in Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, to Hamilton Norman Sleigh and Anna Elizabeth Sleigh, n√©e Ward. He was educated at Bath Grammar School and worked for several businesses before gaining employment with the Union Bank of London which was chiefly concerned with overseas clients, so gained some knowledge of international shipping practice. He left for Australia in 1888 and became involved in barge traffic on the rivers Murray and Darling. = Shipping = Sleigh owned the steamers Emu from 1891 and Ethel Jackson from 1892 or earlier. Both did service on the Darling River out of Bourke, New South Wales. Around 1893 he began working for Harrold Brothers, ship brokers and owners of Melbourne, and while with that company he privately tendered for a contract in which his employers were interested. His resignation was accepted and well advertised. He won the contract, which was to carry coal from Newcastle, New South Wales for the Western Australian Government Railways for two years. He took a six-month charter of SS Eskdale and two sister ships Tangier and Asphodel, which were more than capable of filling the contract, plus general cargo and passengers in steerage, for which there was a strong demand, especially to the goldfields. W. R. Cave of Adelaide acted as agent, then in August 1896 W. Howard Smith's recently (1890) formed Intercolonial Steamship Company took over the contract. Around the same time he ordered two cargo steamers, Cape Leeuwin and Cape Otway, from Russell & Co. of Glasgow, but no sooner had they been launched, than Sleigh's Australian Transport Company sold them to the A.U.S.N. Company In 1898 he chartered the A.U.S.N. steamer Victoria to carry kauri logs from Kaipara, New Zealand, to Port Phillip and pioneered the commercial shipping of horses by the steamer Ashley, and in 1899 opened the live sheep and cattle export trade to Southern Africa when 500 bullocks and 1,000 sheep were sent by the China Mutual Company's steamer Ningchow from Brisbane to Laurenco Marques. By the end of the century his trade with South Africa had increased immensely, notably by steamers Inchmona, Henley, Florence Pile, Glanton, Beira, Moel Eilian and George Pyman. His \\"Blue Star Line\\" included steamers Baron Eldon and Venetia. In 1902 he floated in London the Colonial Steamship Company to carry freight between Melbourne, Durban, and New Zealand, and was granted a subsidy of ¬£30,000 by the New Zealand Government. In 1909 he won a contract for a fortnightly shipping service between Melbourne and Fiji. Sleigh was also a successful ship broker, finding Japanese buyers for the collier Alabama in 1924, Chinese buyers for Corio in 1926, Moorabool and four NZ ships in 1928 and Mawatta in 1937. In 1925 Sleigh won the Coastal Shipping Service contract to service the many Northern Territory coastal and island communities from Darwin, using the steamer Kinchela. In 1926 he purchased the 500-ton German steamer Mars, renamed Marion Sleigh, as a replacement. The contract was terminated within a year and the ship was put into weekly service Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle. In 1932, after a few years lying idle in Sydney Harbour, she was sold and renamed Port Whangarei. = Petroleum = 1919 advertisement According to one account, Sleigh started in the petroleum trade in 1913, when a customer was unable to pay freight on a shipment of motor spirit, and the company took possession of the consignment. In 1917 he registered the trade name \\"Golden Fleece\\" for \\"illuminating, heating and lubricating oils, including petrol, benzine and kerosene\\", and the following year was clearly marketing \\"benzine\\" as a fuel for motorcycles. He got a Californian oil company to supply four-gallon (US five-gallon) cans of motor spirit, branded \\"Golden Fleece\\" to his order (see advertisement, right). :Petrol was in those days shipped, and sold, in four- gallon (18 litre) cans, roughly cubic in shape, two to the wooden case. By 1923, shipments of motor spirit were arriving monthly; the March consignment of 13,000 cases () arrived per Vinita. By June 1926 Golden Fleece fuel was also shipped in 44-gallon drums and dispensed at the garage or service station from a kerbside \\"bowser\\". In 1930 Sleigh began shipping bulk petrol by the tanker Mexico. Promotion The company's advertising was initially directed at motorcycle enthusiasts: around 1915 Sleigh became personally interested in motor-cycling, and began sponsoring trophies for the Victorian Motorcycle Club. In 1923 he sponsored a record-breaking motorcycle ride, Adelaide to Sydney () in 40 hours 9 min. He supported automobile club events to a similar extent, but was greatly overspent by the likes of Dunlop and the motor car retailers.‚â§  Premises  In 1919 the company had an outlet at 2 Bridge Street, Sydney, selling \\"Summit\\" lubricating oils and \\"Golden Fleece\\" gasoline. both modest classified advertisements. By 1923 they had premises at 228‚Äì230 Pirie Street, Adelaide and a bulk storage depot at Albert Park. The facility was destroyed in 1929 by fire, which raged for several days. = Other commodities = In 1921 Sleigh, with A. Coombs and J. T. Caldwell, secured a lease on Solomon Islands timber He had one of the few licences to ship Australian sandalwood to China from the Port Pirie ‚Äì Port Augusta region of South Australia.  Personal  Sleigh married Marion Elizabeth Chapple (1869 ‚Äì 20 June 1941) on 5 June 1895 at St John's Church, Melbourne. She was daughter of John William Chapple and Marion Chapple, nƒóe Dowsett. *Their only son (later Sir) Hamilton Morton Howard Sleigh (20 March 1896 ‚Äì 24 November 1979) became partner, and on his father's death took over the company as chairman and chief executive. Sleigh was appointed Honorary Finnish Vice- Consul for Victoria in 1922. In 1926 he travelled to London, partly on business, but notably to consult specialists regarding a mysterious affliction affecting his foot. No treatment helped, and the leg was amputated. Sleigh became seriously ill in December 1932 and died aged 65 at his home \\"Laradoc\\", 111 Walsh Street, South Yarra and was buried at the Box Hill Cemetery.  Recognition  A 13,000-ton tanker, launched 1953, was named Harold Sleigh in his honour.

Early life  Muriel Elsie Webb (later Langford) was born in West Ham, Essex in 1913. After the completion of high school she worked in a factory, in addition to training as a secretary. She attended Derby Road Methodist Church where she met Bernard Langford. They married in Essex in 1936. They were both Conscientious Objectors who struggled with discrimination during World War II. Langford saw an advertisement for hospital managers to volunteer in India and she and Bernard took up this role from 1944‚Äì1955, whilst rearing their children.  Move to Australia and work with Indigenous Australians  In 1955, the Langfords moved to Australia, where Bernard Langford served as an Anglican minister in Devonport, Tasmania. They moved to Queensland in 1957 and her husband became the Queensland Secretary for the Council of Churches. It was at this time she became aware of the work of Joyce Wilding who was establishing a hostel in Brisbane for Aboriginal people. Langford became involved with the work of QCAATSI in the late 1950s before becoming involved with the establishment of the One People of Australia League (OPAL) in 1961. Langford worked alongside Joyce Wilding, Kathie Cochrane, Oodgeroo Noonuccal, Rita Huggins, Sylvia Cairns and May McBride as they developed programs which provided networks of support for Indigenous families who had moved to Brisbane. OPAL programs included the development of homework classes, holiday camps, housing and job related support. In 1962, Wilding, Langford and Cairns helped to establish a hostel which was named OPAL House in South Brisbane, as a hostel for families who had moved to Brisbane for work but were unable to find housing. As part of the activism going on for the referendum of 1967, Langford visited editors of newspapers, spoke on television and met with staff of government departments to lobby for greater support of the work of OPAL in breaking down barriers to education and training. In 1970, Langford and Wilding were successful in acquiring a former motel in the Brisbane suburb of Upper Mount Gravatt to provide a home for Aboriginal children. This housing complex was called the Joyce Wilding OPAL Home. Senator Neville Bonner, the then president of OPAL and his wife Heather were married from OPAL House in 1972. She helped lobby for the establishment of the Aboriginal and Islander Independent Community School in 1986. Langford graduated with a BA from the University of Queensland in 1978, in French and Anthropology and worked for the Queensland Canegrowers Council as an editor. She published a book with Malcom Thomis, Rocky point and the Heck Family : 100 years of sugar milling in south-east Queensland (1979). After a number of years of ill health, she died on January 9, 2003. She was survived by her children.

He was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and sent for treatment at a psychiatric hospital.  Biography  Reginald Oates was born in 1950, in Baltimore, Maryland, and was adopted at an early age by the Oates couple. The family lived in an urban area populated primarily by white Americans, as a result of which they were subjected to segregation, with Oates spending his childhood and adolescence in a socially disadvantageous atmosphere, being attacked by his white peers. In 1965, while he was in the 9th grade, Oates was accused of attempting to rob another student at gunpoint for a few cents, a claim forwarded by other students at his school, which he himself denied committing. In spite of the potential media bias against him, he was found guilty, convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment, which he served in an institution for juvenile offenders. After their son's conviction, Oates' adoptive parents claimed that he was yet another victim of racism. During his imprisonment, Oates was physically and sexually abused by other prisoners, greatly scarring and traumatizing him. After his release, he returned to his parents, dropped out of school and found work as a waste collector. Not long after, he converted to Christianity, but also began showing signs of a mental illness.  Murders  On April 17, 1968, Oates lured 10-year-old Lewis Hill into Gwynns Falls Leakin Park, where he beat and raped him. Afterwards he slit Hill's throat and violate his corpse before slicing off his head and wrists. The next day, using the same tactic, Oates lured three boys into the park: 8-year-old Larry Jefferson, his 5-year-old brother Mack and 10-year-old Lester Watson, beating and stabbing all three numerous times. Like with Hill, he had sex with the children's bodies, gutting their internal organs and cutting off their genitals, which he took with him. The day after, the boys' bodies were found by the authorities. On that same day, Oates managed to lure two underage girls into the park, which he unsuccessfully attempted to attack. He was quickly detained by law enforcement officers who, during his arrest, confiscated two bags and lunchboxes containing the murder weapons and parts from the bodies of the murdered children.  Subsequent events  Following his arrest, Oates was charged with four murders, rapes, two assaults with intent of rape, and one armed robbery. He himself plead not guilty, declaring that he was insane. He was examined by psychiatrists, who, in November of that year, verified that Oates couldn't stand trial due to his mental condition. As a result, he was sent for compulsory treatment at the Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital in Jessup, where he remains to this very day.

It is situated in the administrative South Downtown (≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie Po≈Çudniowe) district, on the western bank of the Vistula river. The 53-hectare park opened on 22 July 1955 and was continuously enlarged up until 1964. History Tenements at Rozbrat Street, which passes through the parkland The park was founded on the former estate of prince Kazimierz Poniatowski (1721‚Äì1800), lord chamberlain of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and brother of Poland's last king Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus. The previous palatial gardens were designed by renowned architect Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug. When the property passed to the aristocratic Branicki family, a large Renaissance Revival-styled residence was erected on the site, which became known as the \\"Red Palace\\" (Czerwony Pa≈Çac). The building hosted the offices of the French Embassy until its destruction in World War II. The sole remainder of the palace today are two grand staircases with decorative balustrades and an elevated terrace which once overlooked the gardens. The project of creating a new central parkland to the once-densely populated suburb was initiated in 1952. The majority of the pre-war dwellings were either completely destroyed or had to be demolished in the post-war years due to their structural vulnerability and poor design. One of the park's alleys The chief landscape architects who composed the layout of the new park were Alina Scholtz, Zygmunt Stƒôpi≈Ñski and Longin Majdecki. The main alley was opened in 1955; the site was subsequently extended into the adjacent Solec neighbourhood, closer to the riverside. Up to 1992, the parkland grounds were collectively known as the \\"Central Park of Culture\\" (Centralny Park Kultury). With the fall of communism, the new authorities decided to rename the parkland in honour of Poland's marshal and military commander in World War II, Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy.

While teaching at University of Southampton, Croudace founded GAU-Radioanalytical Laboratories in 1987, and served as its Director till 2018. Following this, he was promoted to Professor Emeritus at the University. = Entrepreneurship = Croudace is the inventor of the prototype Itrax micro-XRF sediment core scanner and the Hyperbaric Oxidiser and co-inventor of the Pyrolyser-Trio instrument. He is a co-founder and Director of Raddec International, an R&D; company designing and manufacturing instruments for the extraction and trapping of volatile radionuclides.  Research and work  Croudace‚Äôs main research interests encompass the petrogenesis of granitoid rocks and the application of several analytical tools (X-ray fluorescence analysis, gamma ray spectrometry, radio- analytical chemistry, micro-XRF analysis of sediment, mass spectrometry) to solve problems in environmental geochemistry and nuclear forensics. Croudace has conducted extensive research on the development and applications of the ITRAX Scanner and XRF Core Scanning techniques. In 2006, he authored a seminal article explaining the features and properties of the ITRAX along with the detailed comparison of data collected with a regular wavelength-dispersive XRF spectrometer. In 2020 Croudace co-authored publications that exploited the power of the ITRAX to undertake high resolution analysis of lake sediment cores which often hold long records of environmental change. In one study, Croudace and co-workers used Double-Spike Lead Isotopes, Radiochronology, and Sediment Microanalysis to study Anthropogenic and Natural Inputs to the largest lake in England (Windermere) that preserved a high-resolution record of pollution. The research indicated a significant concentration increase of elements zinc, copper and lead in sediment around the 1930s and identified the main sources of anthropogenic lead. Its new insights about the pollution history of Windermere could be applied to other lakes with anthropogenic inputs. ITRAX data also contributed a key component of another multi-proxy study of sediment cores from Windermere that provided information on climatic and anthropogenic changes with time and yielded a detailed history of lake and catchment conditions over the past 300 years. In another multi-proxy study, Croudace contributed ITRAX data for lake sediments from Vanuatu, Samoa, and the Southern Cook Islands that hypothesised that the timing and driver for human migration into East Polynesia coincided with a prolonged drought. High resolution variations in ITRAX titanium and other data indicated major catchment disturbances and increases in soil erosion linked to the arrivals of humans. An innovative application of ITRAX core scanners was in water pollution investigations. In this study, a series of ion exchange resin sachets were systematically deployed to monitor changes in heavy metal pollutants entering water courses. Rapid measurement of archived sets of sachets were efficiently made using an ITRAX scanner. The methodology became an environmental forensics tool for wastewater pollution sources. Croudace‚Äôs 2015 book entitled \\"Micro-XRF Studies of Sediment Cores: Applications of a non-destructive tool for the environmental sciences\\" was reviewed by Wojciech Tylmann from University of Gda≈Ñsk. He writes that the book has a \\"clear structure\\" and contains \\"an impressive data set regarding specific applications of micro-XRF core scanners\\". He further writes that the \\"content is well illustrated\\" and that \\"this book will serve as a priceless source of information for new researchers\\". Along with environmental geochemistry research using ITRAX and XRF scanners, Croudace also worked extensively on radionuclide science throughout his career. For example, he conducted an experiment in 1998 that used magnetotactic bacteria to recover radionuclides from wastewater. In 2000, he led a high-profile project that used Mass Spectrometric Measurements of Uranium Isotopes to investigate an alleged nuclear incident at Greenham Common Airbase in 1958. In order to detect the possible contamination from the supposed nuclear incident he studied over 600 soil samples from the Airbase and surrounding areas to determine their Uranium isotopic composition and developed an efficient and precise method of Uranium analysis. Results showed no evidence of anomalous Uranium isotope contamination on the Airbase. However, the detection of anomalous Uranium near the Atomic Weapons Establishment (Aldermaston) served to validate the effectiveness of the research approach used for the environmental survey. In 1996, Croudace introduced for the first time the application of Lithium Borate Fusion for the ultra-rapid dissolution of soil and other complex samples in radioanalytical chemistry. He also showed the effectiveness of the method as being suitable for sample preparation in nuclear waste characterisation Based on his radioanalytical expertise he was invited to produce a paper to highlight recent contributions to the rapid screening of radionuclides in the field of nuclear forensics and nuclear waste characterisation. Croudace also undertook significant research and development in the extraction of volatile radionuclides (tritium, C-14 etc) from environmental and nuclear materials. This work led to the commercialization of the Raddec Pyrolyser thermal desorption instrument.

The two-dimensional version of the theorem states that, if a finite set of red and blue points in the Euclidean plane has the property that, for every four points, there exists a line separating the red and blue points within those four, then there exists a single line separating all the red points from all the blue points. Donald Watson phrases this result more colorfully, with a farmyard analogy: More generally, for finitely many red and blue points in d-dimensional Euclidean space, if the red and blue points in every subset of d+2 of the points are linearly separable, then all the red points and all the blue points are linearly separable. Another equivalent way of stating the result is that, if the convex hulls of finitely many red and blue points have a nonempty intersection, then there exists a subset of d+2 points for which the convex hulls of the red and blue points in the subsets also intersect. History and proofs The theorem is named after German mathematician Paul Kirchberger, a student of David Hilbert at the University of G√∂ttingen who proved it in his 1902 dissertation, and published it in 1903 in Mathematische Annalen, as an auxiliary theorem used in his analysis of Chebyshev approximation. A report of Hilbert on the dissertation states that some of Kirchberger's auxiliary theorems in this part of his dissertation were known to Hermann Minkowski but unpublished; it is not clear whether this statement applies to the result now known as Kirchberger's theorem. Since Kirchberger's work, other proofs of Kirchberger's theorem have been published, including simple proofs based on Helly's theorem on intersections of convex sets, based on Carath√©odory's theorem on membership in convex hulls, or based on principles related to Radon's theorem on intersections of convex hulls. However, Helly's theorem, Carath√©odory's theorem, and Radon's theorem all postdate Kirchberger's theorem. Generalizations and related results A strengthened version of Kirchberger's theorem fixes one of the given points, and only considers subsets of d+2 points that include the fixed point. If the red and blue points in each of these subsets are linearly separable, then all the red points and all the blue points are linearly separable. The theorem also holds if the red points and blue points form compact sets that are not necessarily finite. By using stereographic projection, Kirchberger's theorem can be used to prove a similar result for circular or spherical separability: if every five points of finitely many red and blue points in the plane can have their red and blue points separated by a circle, or every d+3 points in higher dimensions can have their red and blue points separated by a hypersphere, then all the red and blue points can be separated in the same way.

He was a member of the patrician Albrechts of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, many of whose members served in administrative capacities in that city during the second half of the Holy Roman Empire.  Early Life  Georg Albrecht was born to Leonhard Albrecht and Maria Magdalena Albrecht (n√©e Forst) on 8th July 1603 in Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Leonhard Albrecht was a member of the Exterior Council of Rothenburg, and Maria Magdalena Albrecht was the daughter of Michael Forst, Vogt of Absberg and bailiff for the Dean of Comburg near Schw√§bisch Hall. Leonhard Albrecht died on 19th January 1613 when Georg was only 9 years old, but his mother, Maria Magdalena, remarried to Bernhard Betzold, a member of Rothenburg's Interior Council which ensured that Georg would continue to be well connected.  Education  Georg Albrecht was sent first to the German school in Rothenburg and then, on the advice of his headmaster, to the Latin school, where he completed his secondary education. After commencing his university studies at the University of Altdorf, Georg moved onto the University of Strasbourg, which he entered on 2nd June 1621. There, in addition to the political theory of Thucydides and Sch√∂nborner, he studied various aspects of law under the polymath Professor Matthias Bernegger (1582‚Äì1640).Matthias Bernegger, noted for his translations of Justinus and Tacitus, was a regular correspondent of Johannes Kepler (Astronomer and Mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperors Rudolf II, Mathias, and Ferdinand II). Bernegger and Kepler were considered the contemporary leaders in thought around rationalistic science. See Whaley, Joachim (2012). Germany and the Holy Roman Empire Volume 1: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia 1493-1648. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 542. In 1624, Georg submitted a political-legal thesis entitled De Judiciorum Cura Politica which calls for the professionalization and secularization of the legal process within the Holy Roman Empire. Written just six years after the outbreak of the Thirty Years War, Georg Albrecht's thesis conveys the tension of the prevalent Zeitgeist,At this time, Catholic forces held the upper hand. Peter H.

The Thirty Years War: A Sourcebook. Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave MacMillan. p. 1. . exhibiting influences from both the French jurist and political philosopher, Jean Bodin (1529‚Äì1596), who advocated strong and centralised state government, and the staunchly protestant Bernegger with his humanitarian leanings. Georg's time at Strasbourg (1621-25) and a visit to T√ºbingen in August 1625 saw him mixing in influential Lutheran circlesGeorg Albrecht maintained a 'Book of Friends' in which he listed his contacts.

Auckland: AM Publishing p.24-5. and making contacts that he would retain after returning to his war-ravaged home of Rothenburg ob der Tauber which was, itself, a Lutheran city.  Marriage and Children  A member of Georg Albrecht's step-father's family, Johann Betzold (a former Mayor of Rothenburg), facilitated Georg's own marriage to Susanna Husel, daughter of Conrad Husel, a member of Rothenburg's Interior Council, and Maria Salome Husel who was the step-daughter of another of Rothenburg's former Mayors, Georg Nusch. Johann Betzold also became godfather to Georg and Susanna's eldest son, Johann Georg Albrecht, who was born on 25th February 1629. Georg and Susanna had eight children in total - four sons and four daughters - of which five (Anna Charia b. 5th October 1627, Susanna Margaretha b. 28th January 1642, Maria Magdalena b. 12th August 1643, Andreas Conrad b. 30th November 1635, and Johann Georg b. 25th February 1629) outlived their father.  Municipal Career  Upon returning to Rothenburg after completing his university studies, Georg Albrecht was earmarked as a potential future leader, being identified as a 'First-grade Future Dignitary' in 1627, the year of his marriage to Susanna Husel. In 1628 he was appointed to Rothenburg's Exterior Council in which office he performed the function of Assessor of the local peasant court. In 1632 he was appointed to Rothenburg's Interior Council and, a year later, in 1633, Georg was elected to the position of Middle Tax Official, a role he was to hold for the next 25 years. 230x230pxIn 1634 he was appointed Consistor and Scolarcha, the office responsible for introducing all pastors and clerics to their communities both in the city of Rothenburg and in its wider regions. He was also responsible for managing communal alms. Georg was granted the W√ºrzburg fiefs for two separate years (1635 and 1644) before being handed both them and the Imperial fiefs on an ongoing basis from 1657, after which year he was officially recognised and received by the government of the incoming Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I. That recognition was also the catalyst for the upgrade of the Albrecht family coat of Arms to include the Spangenhelm or helmet braces. In 1658, Georg was elected Mayor of Rothenburg ob der Tauber for the first time. The same year, he also became Hospital Manager, holder of a Wildbann (a royal hunting privilege granted during the Holy Roman Empire),See Wildbannforst for more information and, again, Manager of the Communal Alms. In 1659 the city council appointed him Vogt and Ober- Steurer, and, in 1660, he was made Manager of Monasteries and elected Mayor for the second time. Georg Albrecht's third election to Mayor came three years later, in 1663.  Death and Burial  260x260px At lunch on Monday 5th February 1666, Georg Albrecht started to experience indigestion which was followed by difficulty speaking. That first episode passed and, in the afternoon, he carried on with his civic duties as a tax officer. Later on, he was required at the city Registry and there he suffered a serious stroke and was carried home by his son, the - by then - Dr. Johann Albrecht, and the Registry Officer, Johann Nusch. In the early hours of the following morning - before 4 am on Tuesday 6th February 1666 - Georg Albrecht passed away. He is buried alongside his wife Susanna (d. 1682) in the Alter Friedhof - or Old Cemetery - in Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Georg Albrecht's legacy to his home town is summed up in the last lines of his epitaph: And that God may inspire more people like him who can lead us and who can put God's honour and the edification of church and school first, and look seriously after our common gain and prosperity so that we can lead a quiet life and finally may be happy for ever in Christ, Amen.Epitaph of Georg Albrecht, 1666, Rothenburg.

In 1977, McCray returned to Washington to create Mind Power, a jazz fusion group in succession of Return to Forever, Chick Corea, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and John McLaughlin. McCray was lead singer of this group. The group also included Dr. Know on guitar, Darryl Jenifer on bass, and Earl Hudson on drums. The band name was inspired by Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude by Napoleon Hill. The first concert took place in Hudson's basement. In 1978, many punk rock bands were beginning to form, such as The Dickies, the Dead Boys, and the Sex Pistols. The band renamed themselves the Bad Brains in honor of the song, Bad Brain, on the fourth album of the Ramones, titled Road to Run. The Bad Brains were one of the first entirely African American punk rock bands and one of the pioneers of hardcore punk. That same year, they recorded Black Dots. In 1979, McCray was replaced by singer H.R., brother of drummer Earl Hudson, and the group evolved into reggae. However, McCray would continue to accompany the group on tour.

Refugees lack adequate materials to construct and reinforce semi-permanent houses. In particular, plastic sheeting and other roofing materials are needed. Because of the lack of materials, refugees attempt to gather wood and grass from surrounding areas to reinforce their homes, which contradicts existing laws about environmental use. Refugees also reported that there are not enough persons with specific needs (PSN) shelters, especially for disabled and elderly refugees.There is a lack of materials to construct household latrines, including slabs, poles, and roofing materials. Residents resort to sharing latrines with neighbours or open defecation in the absence of these facilities.  Food and Nutrition  This is a persistent challenge since Households are not able to grow sufficient food to supplement their small food rations because their allocated plots are not large enough to cultivate. Humanitarian organizations have begun to shift from emergency response to stabilization. With some emergency-focused partner organizations scaling down or ending their operations, it is critical that gaps in assistance are filled to ensure refugees have sufficient support.  Healthcare  Services to do with health care and sanitation are inadequate for the settlement population. There is only one health center for refugees in Baratuku camp which also serves large populations of Ugandan nationals and other refugees from Elema settlement and makes service delivery so slow and insufficient to refugees. It therefore has a greater impact for the young and elderly since they are prone to infections and disease outbreaks. Speaking frankly about their decision to use family planning,after surviving conflict and enduring a perilous journey to Uganda, the reduced number of refugees at Baratuku refugee settlement are unwilling to allow social pressure to interfere with their families or their futures as their family planning strategies are being put to implementation.  Education  The sole secondary school that serves school-age youth in Baratuku refugee settlement is located far away from the settlement, making it difficult for students to get there. Even for refugee families that live near the school, many have limited livelihoods opportunities and cannot afford tuition and related school costs which poses a great challenge to the young uneducated generation. At the Global Refugee Forum, Education Cannot Wait commits to investing in multi-year programmes for refugees and host-community children which initiative seeks to relinquish the refugees of their dire need for educational resources and providence of scholastics, this gives the refugees and Host communities at the Baratuku refugee settlement to enjoy a chance to be free in educational sector reinforcement.

Background Internal exile has a long history of use by rulers of Greece, and in the early twentieth century was used for opponents of Venizelism, such as monarchists, conservatives or communists. During the National Schism and after the coming of Venizelos in power, in summer 1917, many political opponents (such as the former PM Spyridon Lambros) were put in internal exile.ŒîŒπŒªŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ œÉœÖŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±œÇ:20ŒøœÇ Œ±ŒπœéŒΩŒ±œÇ, Œ£œÄœçœÅŒøœÇ ŒíŒªŒ±œáœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, ŒïœÖŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏Œ∑œÇ ŒßŒ±œÑŒ∂Œ∑Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒøœÖ Exile was preferred to imprisonment on the mainland because the mainland prisons were overcrowded and exile made it easier to monitor the prisoners' correspondence and limit their political influence. The 1929 Idionymon law criminalized subversive ideas as well as actions, leading to an increase in the number of prisoners. The island of Ai Stratis was used from 1929 and was not shut down until 1974. Until 1943, there were no camps and the exiles rented houses from the local residents. Metaxas regime Prison camps for political dissidents on barren islands were established by the Metaxas regime (1936‚Äì1941). Under Metaxas about 1,000 were sentenced to internal exile, including members of the Communist Party of Greece, socialists, trade union organizers, and others who opposed the government. Most of those imprisoned were working-class, but others were intellectuals. Prisoners sentenced to internal exile were taken to barren islands where they had to organize their own food and shelter. Greek Civil War During and after the Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì1949), thousands of left-wing combatants and suspected sympathizers were arrested and imprisoned. After the civil war, political prisoners continued to be held throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The island of Makronisos was used from 1947 to 1955 and became something of a \\"model camp\\" for the Greek junta. In Ai Stratis, where 5,500 people including women and children were sent between 1946 and 1947, camps were established for the first time. Twenty thousand were sent to a concentration camp on the uninhabited island of Gyaros, dubbed \\"Dachau of the Mediterranean\\". The prisoners had to work building the prison, but as soon as it was completed, the island was shut down in 1952 due to condemnation from the United Nations of the poor conditions there. Ai Stratis, designated for \\"unrepentant\\" prisoners, remained open until 1963, although the number of prisoners gradually decreased. Greek junta Following the coup of 21 April 1967, the junta expanded the arrest of political dissidents and the use of prison islands. Around 6,000 people were sent to Gyaros, now called the \\"Greek Gulag\\". The junta denied that political prisoners were held there, but the lie was exposed when German journalists for Stern rented a plane and photographed the island from the air, revealing the truth. Gyaros was shut down in November 1968 following international protest of its poor conditions and criticism from the Red Cross. Ai Stratis, reopened by the junta and used for individual cases, was devastated by a 1968 earthquake that destroyed much of the camp where prisoners were forced to live. In October 1974 just before the 1974 Greek legislative election, five leaders of the junta including Georgios Papadopoulos were temporarily exiled to Kea. Aftermath The practice of internal exile was abolished in 1974, during the Metapolitefsi. The island of Makronisos has been protected since 1989. Greece is trying to have the island recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, to \\"preserv[e] the island of exile and its remaining ruins as symbols of the struggle against fascism, and of the human spirits and democracy‚Äôs triumph against oppression and dehumanization\\".

Many variations result in imbalances that can throw off even the strongest players and chess engines. On September 9, 2020, Grandmaster Brandon Jacobson (iamstraw) initiated the Nakhmanson Gambit and defeated Magnus Carlsen (DrNykterstein) in a Lichess bullet game after Carlsen made a blunder on the tenth move. Furthermore, in a series of videos in his Nakhmanson Gambit playlist, YouTuber Jonathan Schrantz demonstrates that it is possible to obtain a decisively winning position against Stockfish 11 by coercing the engine to play into considerably counter-intuitive lines, although the game conditions remain questionable.  Nakhmanson Gambit Accepted  White attempts to sacrifice his queenside knight in order to deflect the d4 pawn from blockading the d-file. If Black accepts by playing 6...dxc3, White's usual continuation is 7.Bxf7, sacrificing the bishop. After 7...Kxf7, White forks the black king and the knight on e4 using the semi-open d-file by playing 8.Qd5. While the engine's recommended continuation for Black is 8...Kf6!, counterintuitively bringing the king closer to the white pieces, the most commonly played move for humans is 8...Ke8?! even though it is an inaccuracy. After Ke8, if White plays 9.Qxe4? as expected, Black survives after blocking the check by playing 9...Qe7 with tempo (white will need to spend a move avoiding the queen trade to prevent simplifying), or even 9...Be7 stopping the attack. However, White can instead play 9.Re1, pinning the knight and refuting Black's defensive ideas by threatening to take it with the rook rather than the queen. The most common and computer recommended continuation is to unpin the knight with the bishop by playing 9...Be7. White now takes the black knight on e4 with his rook with 10.Rxe4, winning a piece back while also pinning the black bishop on e7. Despite still being down a piece, White maintains strong initiative with plans to abuse the pin on the black bishop on e7 and put more pressure by developing his bishop to g5 and doubling his rooks on the e-file.

Suppressed by the forces of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The uprising began untimely, since the Extraordinary Commission by that moment had begun arresting the Moscow branch of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom. This inopportune and inability to coordinate with other anti‚ÄìBolshevik forces around the region of the uprising predetermined an unfortunate outcome. The lack of reinforcements and ammunition from the rebels also affected. Preconditions and organization of the uprising Along with the Rybinsk Uprising and the Murom Uprising, the Yaroslavl Uprising was organized by the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom, created by Boris Savinkov with the approval of the command of the Volunteer Army in the person of Generals Lavr Kornilov and Mikhail Alekseev. The purpose of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom was to organize resistance to Bolshevism in Central Russia. Carrying out the general leadership of the uprising in these cities, Boris Savinkov sent the chief of staff of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom, Colonel Alexander Perkhurov, to Yaroslavl and instructed him to lead an armed uprising there.\\"Fight Against the Bolsheviks\\" ‚Äì Warsaw: Edition of the Russian Political Committee, 1920 The organizers of the uprising were the local branch of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom. At the beginning of 1918, it was the most powerful anti‚ÄìSoviet organization in Central Russia, with cells not only in Yaroslavl, but also in all large Upper Volga cities: Rybinsk, Murom, Kostroma. The presence of a well‚Äìbranched underground network made it possible to create the core of the future resistance. The union interacted with local organizations of the Union of Officers, the Union of Front‚Äìline Soldiers and the Union of Saint George's Cavaliers, and also coordinated work with the anti‚ÄìSoviet underground in Moscow, but due to the weakness of the latter and the growing activity of the All‚ÄìRussian Extraordinary Commission, the main focus was on the provincial centers. The choice of Yaroslavl as a stronghold for the uprising was due to a combination of several factors: *It was a large provincial center on the Volga; the main railway to the North and Siberia ran here. Yaroslavl could be seen as the northern key to Moscow; *After part of the local Red Guard units were sent to Moscow and the Kuban to assist in the fight against the white movement, the number of organized and armed supporters of Soviet power in the city decreased;Civil War in the Soviet Union (In 2 Volumes) / Team of Authors, Editor Nikolai Azovtsev. Volume 1 ‚Äì Moscow: Military Publishing House of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union, 1980 ‚Äì Pages 77, 81 *A tragic and naive belief in support of the Allies costing dearly to all white forces in the war. The rebels hoped for outside help, from anti‚ÄìSoviet forces and organizations, as well as from the Entente countries (Boris Savinkov was given a promise to support the uprising by a French landing in Arkhangelsk, but in practice, the Entente landing force landed in Arkhangelsk only in August); *Another factor that influenced the choice of Yaroslavl as a place of performance could be the deployment of the headquarters of the Yaroslavl Military District, which was engaged in the formation of Red Army units in the Northern Volga region, since March 1918. This allowed many officers to legally arrive in the city, and with the outbreak of the uprising, it immediately disorganized command and control over a vast territory; *There is also a certain continuity of the July uprising in relation to the anti‚ÄìBolshevik resistance in Yaroslavl after October 1917. At the beginning of 1918, anti‚ÄìSoviet demonstrations already took place in Yaroslavl, one of which took place on Easter days, but was quickly suppressed. Rebellion leaders *The general leadership of the uprising and the actions of the armed formations was carried out by the monarchist, representative of the Volunteer Army, Colonel Alexander Perkhurov; *A railway employee, a Menshevik Ivan Savinov (according to other sources, a member of the Rescue Committee Alexander Kizner) became an assistant to the chief in civil affairs; *Vladimir Lopatin, a homeowner, engineer by profession, who held this post until July 1917, and then worked in the Yaroslavl City Duma as a vowel, was re‚Äìappointed to the post of mayor;At the same time, the Social Democrat Sergei Suvorov, who was elected in the first general, \\"democratic\\" elections on July 30, 1917, resigned (later, he died during the uprising: having volunteered as an envoy to take a letter from the volunteer headquarters to the location of the red troops with an appeal not to destroy the city, he was shot while approaching the Red positions) *The city council included the merchant Kayukov, the cadets Sobolev and Gorelov, as well as the former attorney at law Menshevik Meshkovsky; *The leaders of the insurgents included a former member of the provincial executive committee, socialist‚Äìrevolutionary Nikolai Mamyrin, who made trips to the villages and agitated the peasants for an uprising against Soviet power; *Also, among the participants in the uprising was the former provincial commissar of the Provisional Government Boris Duchenne (who, however, did not hold any administrative posts). Rebellion goals The goals of the rebels were the elimination of the Bolshevik dictatorship, the restoration of political and economic freedoms, the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, the rupture of the Brest‚ÄìLitovsk Peace and, with the help of Russia's allies in the Entente, the opening of a new Eastern Front against Germany and the Bolsheviks. The right of ownership of the peasants to the land was guaranteed on the basis of the law, but by this time the land had been socialized as a \\"common property\\" and transferred to the peasants \\"on the basis of equalizing land use\\" (according to the Decree on Land adopted by the Second All‚ÄìRussian Congress of Soviets on October 26, 1917, whose legitimacy by the rebels did not confess). In the Yaroslavl formula, it was not about the nationality of the land fund, but about the right of the peasant to fully own the land and about the legal guarantees of this property. Since at that time the idea of private ownership of land among the bulk of Russian peasants was not popular, it is possible that this very formulation deprived the rebels of the support of the bulk of the peasantry, since it was perceived as a smokescreen for an attempt to revise the result of the redistribution of land in 1917 with the return landlord land tenure. The appeal also referred to the establishment of \\"strict legal order\\" as \\"the very first measure\\". Opinions differ regarding the tactics and military objectives of the uprising. It is usually believed that the rebels hoped for help from the allies from the North (which was not received) and counted on the possibility of spreading the uprising to other cities in Central Russia and, as a result, everywhere, until the liberation of Moscow. Events Scheme of the Yaroslavl Uprising =Forces of the parties= By the beginning of the uprising, the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom was able to legally concentrate up to 300 officers in the city (the officers' union in Yaroslavl itself numbered about 200 people, another 50 people arrived from Moscow, 30 from Kaluga and 12 from Kostroma).Vasily Tsvetkov. Uprising on the Yaroslavl Land // White Warriors Information Agency, October 31, 2008 Further, in the very first days, the leaders of the uprising announced the re‚Äìestablishment of \\"self‚Äìdefense\\" at the city government (first created in November 1917, but later disbanded by the Soviet government) and enrollment in the volunteer army. On July 6, mobilization was announced ‚Äì compulsory for officers and voluntary for the rest. In general, the number of those who signed up for volunteers numbered about six thousand people, who were supported by the local clergy, intellectuals, as well as peasants in some suburban villages. However, according to the recollections of Perkhurov himself, there were no more than 600‚Äì700 people directly on the front line, most of the \\"volunteers\\" dispersed soon after the start of the fighting. By the beginning of the uprising, the Bolshevik forces in Yaroslavl numbered about 1,000 bayonets, including: the 1st Soviet Regiment (500‚Äì600 bayonets), the Special Communist Detachment (200 bayonets), an auto‚Äìmachine‚Äìgun detachment consisting of two armored cars and five machine guns, and a detachment of horse militia of 100 people. At the very beginning of the uprising, military specialists from among the officers, the auto‚Äìmachine‚Äìgun detachment, the police and part of the personnel of the garrison went over to the side of the rebels. A Special Communist Detachment was taken by surprise, disarmed and arrested. The 1st Soviet Regiment at first declared its neutrality, but after a few hours passed to active actions against the uprising. =Beginning of the uprising= At the beginning of the uprising, the rebels were practically unarmed ‚Äì for 105 people there were only 12 different‚Äìcaliber revolvers and the very possibility of a performance depended only on the capture of weapons from the enemy. On the night of July 6, 1918, the conspirators, led by Alexander Perkhurov, gathered at the Leontief cemetery on the outskirts of Yaroslavl. About half a kilometer from the cemetery there was a warehouse of weapons brought from the front. The rebels attacked the Red Army men guarding the warehouse from several sides, seized it and began to take away the weapons. Thirty armed policemen were dispatched from the city to find out what was happening in the warehouse, as the telephone connection was interrupted, but they immediately joined the rebels. Later, the entire city militia went over to their side, and the provincial militia commissar, Ensign Falaleev, led one of the rebel detachments and later died in battle. Armed, the rebels broke up into groups and moved into the city, where the armored division under the command of Lieutenant Suponin (2 cannon armored vehicles \\"Garford‚ÄìPutilov\\" and 5 large‚Äìcaliber machine guns) crossed over to their side. The 1st Soviet Regiment declared its neutrality. Already by the morning, after a short battle, the Special Communist Detachment was completely disarmed and arrested, the Governor's House was captured, in which the Executive Committee and the Provincial Extraordinary Commission were located, the post office, telegraph, radio station and treasury were occupied. Thus, the entire center of Yaroslavl was in the hands of the rebels, and then the trans‚ÄìVolga part of the city ‚Äì Tveritsy. The commissar of the Yaroslavl military district David Zakheim and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the City Council Semyon Nakhimson were captured in the city apartments, who were the only insurgents killed without trial on the first day of the uprising. After the incident, Perkhurov banned lynching by issuing an order: \\"It is firmly remembered that we are fighting against rapists for legal order, for the principles of freedom and personal inviolability\\". About 200 Soviet and party workers (including delegates to the congress), communists and their supporters were arrested and placed on a barge, which was taken from the shore and anchored. =Height of the uprising= In Soviet historiography, it is noted that the expansion and spread of the uprising was largely facilitated by the indecision, which in the early days of the uprising was displayed by the local leadership of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army ‚Äì the district military commissar Vasily Arkadiev and the military leader (former Tsarist general) Nikolai Liventsev.Civil War in the Soviet Union (In 2 Volumes) / Team of Authors, Editor Nikolai Azovtsev. Volume 1 ‚Äì Moscow: Military Publishing House of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union, 1980 ‚Äì Page 158 Having taken control of most of the city, the rebels set up their headquarters on Epiphany Square in the city drawing room near the former Transfiguration Monastery. Alexander Perkhurov proclaimed himself \\"Commander‚Äìin‚ÄìChief of the Yaroslavl Province and Commander of the Group of Forces of the Northern Volunteer Army\\". The formation of the Northern Volunteer Army, subordinate to the high command of General Mikhail Alekseev, was announced, in the ranks of which about six thousand people signed up (of which 1600‚Äì2000 participated in the battles). Among those who entered the army were officers, workers, intellectuals, student youth, peasants from the surrounding villages. The workers of the railway workshops sent 140 people, built an armored train, and also repaired weapons and armored cars. But weapons were not enough, especially guns and machine guns (the insurgents had only 2 three‚Äìinch cannons and 15 machine guns at their disposal). Therefore, Perkhurov resorted to defensive tactics, expecting help with weapons and people from Rybinsk. On July 8, the city was restored to the city government \\"on the basis of the Law of the Provisional Government of 1917\\". On July 13, by his resolution, Perkhurov, in order to \\"restore law, order and public peace\\", abolished all bodies of Soviet power and canceled all its decrees and resolutions, and \\"the authorities and officials that existed under the laws in force until the October coup of 1917\\" were restored. The rebels failed to capture the factory settlements across the Kotorosl River, where the 1st Soviet Regiment was located. Soon, the Reds from the Tugovaya Gora dominating over the city began shelling Yaroslavl. The insurgents' expectation that the very fact of the uprising would raise the Yaroslavl and neighboring provinces turned out to be untenable ‚Äì the initial success of the uprising could not be developed, although some of the peasants were ready to support the uprising. Meanwhile, the Soviet military command hastily pulled together troops to Yaroslavl. In the suppression of the uprising, not only the local regiment of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and workers' detachments took part, but also detachments of the Red Guard from Tver, Kineshma, Ivanovo‚ÄìVoznesensk, Kostroma and other cities.Great Soviet Encyclopedia / Edited by Alexander Prokhorov. 3rd Edition.

Encyclopedia / Editorial Board, Editor‚Äìin‚ÄìChief Semyon Khromov. 2nd Edition ‚Äì Moscow: Soviet Encyclopedia, 1987 ‚Äì Page 698 The ring of red troops, at first very weak, began to shrink more and more. It became obvious that the rebels could not hold the city for long. The uprisings in Rybinsk (July 8) and Murom (July 9) were suppressed. Detachments of the Red Guard and part of the \\"internationalists\\" (in particular, the Chinese, German and Austro‚ÄìHungarian prisoners of war) launched an offensive against Yaroslavl. The newspaper \\"Kommersant\\" details the ethnic composition of the \\"red units\\" who arrived in Yaroslavl to suppress the anti‚ÄìBolshevik uprising: \\"Two hundred Latvian riflemen and a group of artillerymen arrived from Rybinsk. On July 8, the Warsaw Soviet Revolutionary Regiment, which was based on the Poles and the Sino‚ÄìKorean company, moved up\\". From behind Kotorosl and from the side of the Vspolye station (now Yaroslavl‚ÄìGlavny), the city was continuously fired upon by artillery and armored trains. Red detachments bombed the city and the suburbs from airplanes. Yaroslavl was the first city in Russian history to be bombed almost entirely by aircraft. As a result of the air strikes, the magnificent Demidov Lyceum was destroyed. According to the headquarters for the elimination of the mutiny: \\"in two flights, more than 12 poods of dynamite bombs were dropped, most of which, according to the information received, fell into the area of the enemy headquarters near the former governor's house... The pilots noticed severe damage to buildings and the resulting fires... The enemy did not open artillery fire, limiting himself to one or two shots from small‚Äìcaliber guns, apparently from armored cars. At present, in view of the stubbornness of the enemy, it has been decided to intensify the bombardment, using for this purpose the most destructive force of the bomb\\". However, the city's defenders stood firm, repelling enemy attacks. Desperate to break the resistance of the Yaroslavl people, Yuri Guzarsky on July 16, 1918 telegraphed the command: Russian State Military Archive. Fund 1. Inventory 3. Case 83. Sheet 353. The Reds subjected the city to artillery fire \\"across the squares\\", as a result of which streets and entire neighborhoods were destroyed. In the part of the city covered by the uprising, up to 80% of all buildings were destroyed. Fires raged in the city as the fire station and city water pumping station were destroyed. In view of the overwhelming numerical and technical superiority of the Reds, further continuation of the armed struggle for the rebels became futile. At the convened military council, Perkhurov insisted on breaking through the army from Yaroslavl and leaving either to Vologda or to Kazan to meet the People's Army. However, most of the commanders, being local residents, led by General Karpov, refused to leave the city and decided to continue the fight as long as possible. The complexity of the situation was that the participants in the uprising were both officers who came from other cities, and retired soldiers and officers of the Russian army who lived in Yaroslavl, and civilians who took up arms. For the first, the military aspect of the \\"operation\\" was important first of all, for the others the rate was immeasurably greater: they defended not only themselves, but also their families, and they had no way of retreat. As a result, it was decided to send for reinforcements a detachment of 50 people, led by Alexander Perkhurov, who left Yaroslavl on a steamer on the night of July 15‚Äì16, 1918. General Pyotr Karpov, whose family lived in Yaroslavl, remained the commander in the city (according to the protocols of the Yaroslavl Extraordinary Commission, he was shot in September 1918). The departure of Perkhurov negatively affected the morale of the rebels, but they continued to resist. By July 20, it became clear to the rebels that there was nothing to resist further, their forces and ammunition were running out. The rebel headquarters decided to end the resistance. But they decided to surrender not to the Red troops, but to the \\"German Commission of Prisoners of War No. 4\\" headed by Lieutenant K. Balk, interned from the beginning of the uprising in the city theater. On July 21, the fighters remaining in Yaroslavl surrendered to the German commission. Although its chairman K. Balk assured the surrendered insurgents that the commission would take the position of \\"armed neutrality\\" and would not hand them over to the Bolsheviks, almost immediately he handed over all the Bolsheviks, who immediately shot them. Significance of the uprising The uprising was defeated due to weak organization, lack of weapons (which became the reason for the defensive strategy of the rebels), the numerical superiority of the Red forces and their intensive use of artillery and aviation. As Boris Savinkov later noted: \\"There was nothing to arm with in Yaroslavl. One has to be surprised not that Colonel Perkhurov did not defeat the Bolsheviks at Yaroslavl, but that he was able to hold out for 17 days\\". Despite the defeat of the uprising in Yaroslavl, it had a significant impact on the development of hostilities in the Volga and the Urals. It did not allow the Bolsheviks to transfer their reserves to the Volga and Ural Fronts, which led to heavy defeats of the Red troops and the capture of Yekaterinburg, Simbirsk and Kazan by anti‚ÄìBolshevik forces. Historiographic estimates Initially, contemporaries, who held different political views, called the event that took place in Yaroslavl \\"uprising\\".Yaroslavl Uprising. 1918 / Under the General Editorship of Academician Alexander Yakovlev; Compiled by Evgeny Ermolin, Vyacheslav Kozlyakov ‚Äì Moscow, 2007 ‚Äì Page 16 But in the 30s of the 20th century, this word was replaced by the label‚Äìconcept \\"rebellion\\", which for decades reigned supreme in Soviet historiography.See, For Example: A Brief History of the Civil War in the Soviet Union ‚Äì Moscow, 1962; Rafail Balashov. Flame Over the Volga ‚Äì Yaroslavl, 1984; Isaac Mints. 1918 ‚Äì Moscow, 1982 However, the old concept of \\"uprising\\" continued to exist in emigre literature.Orlov G. Once Again About the Yaroslavl Uprising // Sentry. For the Homeland, Honor and Freedom ‚Äì No. 337 ‚Äì 1953 Evgeny Ermolin and Vyacheslav Kozlyakov drew attention to this duality. As historians have noted, the reason for this shift in emphasis in the naming of events in Yaroslavl was the ideological content of the concepts of \\"uprising\\" and \\"rebellion\\". If Soviet historians endowed the \\"uprising\\" with the status of inevitability and objectivity, which in the context of Marxist methodology had a positive connotation, then the concept of \\"rebellion\\" was associated with anarchy, caprice, arbitrariness, and lawlessness of the actions carried out. Insisting on an √©migr√© interpretation of the events in Yaroslavl, Yevgeny Ermolin and Vyacheslav Kozlyakov noted two signs that, in their opinion, allow characterizing these events as a large‚Äìscale popular uprising against the Bolsheviks:Yaroslavl Uprising. 1918 / Under the General Editorship of Academician Alexander Yakovlev; Compiled by Evgeny Ermolin, Vyacheslav Kozlyakov ‚Äì Moscow, 2007 ‚Äì Page 16‚Äì17 Aftermath of the uprising =Dead= Soviet side 76‚Äìmm cannon mod. 1902, who participated in the shelling of Yaroslavl.

Yuri Guzarsky, who led the suppression of the uprising, was arrested in 1919 and executed for disobeying orders. In 1958, a monument to the victims of the White Guard rebellion was erected on Sovetskaya Square in Yaroslavl. Anti‚ÄìBolshevik forces During the fighting, about 600 rebels were killed. After the capture of Yaroslavl on July 21, 1918, a mass terror began in the city ‚Äì the massacre of the rebels and residents of the city: on the very first day after the end of the uprising, 428 people transferred by Balk were shot (including the entire headquarters of the rebels ‚Äì 57 people were shot),Ilya Ratkovsky, Mikhail Khodyakov. History of Soviet Russia mainly officers, students, cadets, lyceum students. The number of those executed without trial in the first hours after the suppression of the uprising will never be known. Thus, it can be argued that, with the exception of the hundred of the rebels that managed to escape from the besieged city, almost everyone who took part in the uprising died. The shootings continued even later: in September, the Soviet press recorded more than 60 cases of executions of participants in the uprising. In total, in the Yaroslavl province from March to November 1918, according to the far from complete data of Sergei Melgunov, the Bolshevik authorities shot 5,004 people.Sergey Melgunov.

Destruction of the city During the city battles, the city suffered significant material damage. 20 factories and plants burned down, including a tobacco and match factory, 4 felt, sawmill, lead bleaching, mechanical factories and others. Artillery fire and bombing destroyed 2,147 houses (28 thousand residents were left homeless) and destroyed: the Demidov Juridical Lyceum with its famous library, part of the shopping arcade, dozens of temples and churches, 67 government, medical, and cultural buildings.

The Provisional Government ordered the evacuation of the Artillery Historical Museum. It is believed that one of the reasons for the evacuation was the bronze from which the old weapons were made ‚Äì a strategic metal that Germany was in dire need of. Yaroslavl was chosen as the temporary location of the museum. On September 25, 1917, three barges, loaded with the most valuable weapons, other exhibits and archives, sailed from Petrograd, accompanied by Ensign Kuryshev and three gunners of the 1st Heavy Artillery Brigade, who selflessly tried to save funds from all military and revolutionary cataclysms. In July 1918, the area of the Spassky Monastery, where the museum property was kept, became a battlefield, in the resulting fire, 55 boxes with banners and weapons were completely burned: a total of about 2,000 banners (including valuable, strelets), all trophies collected during the First World War war, 300 copies of old firearms and edged weapons. 54 valuable guns were damaged on the barges, the archive of the 2nd half of the 18th century and partially ‚Äì of the 1st half of the 19th century died in the water. During the days of the uprising, as a result of a fire in the printing house, the manuscript of the last book of a prominent Russian sociologist and jurist, academician Bogdan Kistyakovsky, \\"Law and Science of Law\\", was irretrievably lost. In Yaroslavl, many materials from the scientific expedition of Boris Vilkitsky of 1911‚Äì1916, which studied the possibility of laying the route of the Northern Sea Route off the coast of Taimyr, also perished (the expedition discovered the Vilkitsky Strait, the Land of Emperor Nicholas II (renamed into the Northern Land), the Island of Tsarevich Alexey (Maly Taimyr Island), Andrey Vilkitsky Island and others). The surviving maps and directions of the Vilkitsky expedition were used by subsequent expeditions of polar explorers in the thirties of the 20th century. The fire destroyed materials about the treatment of Alexander Pushkin after being wounded in a duel with Dantes, kept in the Zhuravsky family, descendants of Vladimir Dal, in whose arms the poet died. Reflection in literature, art, journalism *An aspiring Soviet playwright and journalist Alexander Afinogenov in 1925 published a collage play \\"The Snake Trail: A Chronicle of the Yaroslavl Rebellion in 38 Episodes\\" (Yaroslavl: Casting, 1925, 31 Pages); *The emigre writer Leonid Zurov wrote the novel \\"Cadet\\" (Riga, 1928), which combines personal experience of participation in the White movement with the use of information obtained from direct participants in the Yaroslavl uprising. The hero of the story, cadet Mitya Solomin leaves the burnt estate and goes to Yaroslavl, where, together with other students of the local cadet corps, he takes part in an armed uprising against the Bolshevik regime; *Soviet prose writer Alexei Panteleev, who was a witness to the events in childhood, reflected his impressions in the story \\"Lyonka Panteleev\\" (1938, 1952), described in detail the life of the townspeople during the days of the uprising; *In the memoirs of Veniamin Kaverin about Yury Tynyanov \\"Friend of Youth and All Life\\", the author notes that the thesis about Kuchelbecker of a student of Petrograd University, the future outstanding literary critic and prose writer Yuri Tynyanov burned down during the uprising along with the library he had been collecting since his gymnasium years; *The story of Robert Shtilmark \\"The Volga Blizzard\\" (another name is \\"The Passenger of the Last Flight\\", the first publication was the magazine \\"Around the World\\", 1974); *In the novel by Alexey Tolstoy \\"Walking Through the Agony\\", an artistic version of the uprising is given; *The uprising is narrated by Nikolai Chukovsky in the novel \\"Yaroslavl\\"; *The image of the uprising was created in the 1920s by the Yaroslavl artist Alexander Ivanovich Malygin in a series of popular prints; *Yaroslavl prose writer Herbert Kemoklidze in the novel \\"Salin\\" portrayed Semyon Nakhimson, who became one of the first victims of the events; *In 2018, director Sergei Pikalov, commissioned by Channel One, filmed the television series Mutiny, which tells about the participants in the uprising. Remembrance *In the summer of 1918, a solemn funeral of prominent representatives of the Bolshevik Party who died during the uprising took place in Demidovsky Square. In 1919, a wooden rotunda monument was erected on their grave designed by the architect Konstantinovich. In 1958, the dilapidated wooden monument was replaced by a granite monument with bronze and stucco details, designed by architects Mikhail Egorenkov and Kaleria Kozlova; *In Yaroslavl, a number of city streets are named after the Bolsheviks who died during the uprising: Nakhimson Street, Zakheim Street; there are also several streets on the outskirts of the city named after the social democrat Sergei Suvorov. Several streets are named after the red commanders who participated in its suppression: Gromov Street, Babich Street; *In 2017, deputies of the Yaroslavl Regional Duma Vasily Tsependa and Sergei Balabaev prepared a bill according to which the day of the beginning of the uprising ‚Äì July 6 ‚Äì was proposed to be made a memorable date for the Yaroslavl region. In addition, the initiators proposed creating a memorial in Yaroslavl in memory of the tragic events of the summer of 1918. The draft law was not approved by the relevant committee. After the introduction of this initiative at a meeting of the Yaroslavl Regional Duma, the law was rejected by a majority of votes; *In 2018, for the 100th anniversary of the uprising, no significant commemorative events organized by the authorities took place in Yaroslavl. Historian Yevgeny Solovyov published the book \\"The Shot Yaroslavl\\", which examines in detail the course of dramatic events on the Volga, analyzes its causes and consequences. The public organization \\"Youth Council of the City of Yaroslavl\\" has released a game in which the participants experience the days of the uprising, looking at it through the eyes of participants on different sides of the front.

Her work includes understanding of the bat genome and study of how insights from other mammals such as bats might contribute to better understanding and management of ageing and a number of conditions, including deafness and blindness, in humans. She is the co-founder of the Bat1K project to map the genomes of all species of bat. She is also concerned with understanding of the places of bats in the environment and how to conserve their ecosystem. Teeling is a full professor at University College Dublin, where she has founded two scientific centres: the Laboratory of Molecular Evolution and Mammalian Phylogenetics (also known as the \\"BatLab\\"), and the Dublin part of the Centre for Irish Bat Research. Teeling is widely cited in her areas of study and is an elected member of Ireland's national academy, the Royal Irish Academy. Early life Emma Teeling was born to John and Deirdre Teeling. Her father is an academic, and serial entrepreneur in the mining, Irish whiskey and other sectors, while her mother is an academic in the area of education; they married in 1971. She has two younger brothers, Jack and Stephen, and she and her siblings grew up in Clontarf, where her father has his head office for multiple companies and with her mother working in a school in nearby Coolock a northern suburb of Dublin. She played Dublin-level camogie for Fairview. She attended Holy Faith Secondary School in Clontarf, and was the author of one of a set of short articles about late 1980s Moscow for a Soviet Supplement in the Irish Independent, after a school trip to the USSR. Higher education From 1991 to 1995, Teeling took a B.Sc. in Zoology at University College Dublin (UCD), which included study of deer in Dublin's Phoenix Park. She further studied at the University of Edinburgh, for an M.Sc. in Animal Behaviour and Welfare, from 1995, including working with swift foxes at the Cochrane Ecological Institute in Canada. She then saw an advertisement for PhD studies relating to bats, and pursued this from 1997 at Queen's University, Belfast and the University of California at Riverside. She filed her thesis on A molecular perspective on chiropteran systematics in December 2001, and received her PhD in molecular phylgenetics from Queen's. Career Teeling worked as a postdoctoral research fellow from 2002 to 2004 at the US National Cancer Institute near Boston. In 2005, she returned to Ireland to take a role as lecturer in Evolution and Genetics in the School of Biology and Environmental Science at UCD, securing tenure in 2006. She founded the Laboratory of Molecular Evolution and Mammalian Phylogenetics (known as the \\"BatLab\\" even in official materials) at UCD in 2005, and the Centre for Irish Bat Research at UCD in 2008; she remains one of the four Principal Investigators of this cross-border project, and its director. The Laboratory of Molecular Evolution and Mammalian Phylogenetics conducts a large amount of field work in Brittany, working with a conservation organisation, Bretagne Vivante. Teeling is also concerned with understanding of bat populations and their broader ecosystems, and bat conservation. Teeling was promoted to associate professor (in Evolution and Genetics) in 2012, and later to full professor. She is also Head of Zoology. In addition to her research work, she teaches or coordinates a number of courses, and supervises PhD studies. As of 2020, she is also Deputy Director of UCD's Earth Institute. =Research and funding= Over the first 15 years since doctoral qualification, Teeling secured more than 4.4 million euro in research funding for her projects and laboratories. She was one of three applicants selected for a Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) President of Ireland Award in 2006, providing committed funding of over 1.2 million euro over its duration from October 2006 to March 2012 for comparative genomic studies in mammals. She also secured Science Foundation Ireland funding of over 200,000 euro for a study of the population dynamics and conservation status of a small bat, and a small grant for work around ecology and evolution with reference to bats. Teeling secured an award from the European Research Council, for a Starting Investigator work (2013-2018), supported by further SFI commitments. This resulted in the Ageless project, considering how bats weighing as little as 7g can live for over 40 years, possibly due to optimised telomere management. Noting that the Myotis genus of bats don't appear to die from old age as such, Teeling commented \\"Studying wild bats in an ageing context may provide exciting new solutions to slow down the ageing process and ultimately extend human health-spans.\\" Teeling co-founded the Bat1K project to sequence the genomes of all living bat species. A report from this project, looking at the genomes of six bat species and mentioning Teeling and a colleague, was featured on the front cover of Nature magazine in 2020; this recognition was highlighted by the official University College Dublin Facebook page as \\"Congratulations to UCD's resident Batlady Prof Emma Teeling on making the cover of this month's @Nature with her newest genomic research.\\" =Recognition= Teeling was elected to the highest academic honour in Ireland, membership of the national academy, the Royal Irish Academy, in 2016. In 2017, For her scientific work, she was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques; this award, known as \\"the purple\\", is the oldest civilian decoration in France, established by Napoleon. Her husband was also made a Chevalier at the time, for his work in astrophysics. Teeling has also been invited to present her work on ageing at the World Economic Forum in Davos,, where she delivered a presentation entitled Bats and the Secret of Everlasting Youth in a closed session in January 2020. After Davos, in late February 2020, Prof Teeling was invited as one of the speakers at the week- long Genomics Winter School within the Future Biotech Winter Retreat in Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia, and to the leading genetic and cytological research facility of the Russian Federation, where she presented, and performed a \\"Q&A;\\" session, on bats and longevity.

He was first a painter from Bourbonnais (Charroux), until his installation in Provence in Fontvieille, then in Arles where he would reside until his death.  Biography  = Childhood and youth = He was born in the Bourbonnais region in center of France in a bourgeois family. His father is a cavalry officer. His mother, cultivated and artist, watches over the intellectual and artistic education of her three children. She very quickly recognized the precocious artistic gifts of her son Guy, whom she strongly encouraged1. He made his first exhibition in Clermont-Ferrand in 1938, when he was only thirteen years old. Shortly after, he discovered with fascination the world of museums, especially the Louvre. Major dazzling, in particular in front of the Corots, Ruysda√´l, the School of Barbizon - and Rembrandts. At the end of the war, in 1944, he made a short stint at the Beaux-Arts in Paris, whose academicism he rejected. In 1952, he left his native Bourbonnais to settle in Arles then Fontvieille, where he lived until his death; a street bears his name in each of these municipalities. = Private life = Guy Renne - The lyric tree - Indian ink, quill - 50 x65cm - 1981 Guy Renne married Th√©r√®se Touchet on November 10, 1952. They have two children: Gilles Renne (1954), guitarist and jazz composer, and Olivier Renne (1960), jazz drummer and painter. = Experience =  Landscaper  Since his childhood, he has been fascinated and amazed by nature which he will never stop painting, from Bourbonnais until his arrival in Arles. Sketches, oils on paper or canvas mark his discovery of Provence.  Abstract Period  In the 60s, influenced among other contemporaries by Serge Poliakov and especially Nicolas De Sta√´l, he painted abstract works. It is in particular the period of \\"Trigonometric Venus\\". a series of female figures with geometric shapes inspired by Bernard Buffet This evolution towards geometric expression will continue in particular with his Jazz Rhythms series in which he explores the relationship between music and painting.  Trees and Stones  In 1969, he began to graphically interpret the patterns, drawing trees and landscapes of Provence in the series \\"Trees and Stones\\", sketches of the Alpilles then developed in the workshop in large drawings in Indian ink, to feather or reed, sometimes on a light background of printing or colored wash, on the theme of Trees and stones.  Les Baigneuses (Bathers)  The end of the 1970s saw the emergence of the Baigneuses series, oils on paper organized in horizontal registers, in which voluptuous female silhouettes. Around 1985, the landscapes and silhouettes were reduced to rhythmic volumes.

The relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and CI has been long studied in statistical intensity prediction schemes such as the National Hurricane Center Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) and Statistical Typhoon Intensity Prediction Scheme (STIPS). STIPS is run at the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, and is provided to Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) to make cyclone intensity (CI) forecasts in the western North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans. In most of the cyclone models, SST is the only oceanographic parameter representing heat exchange. However, cyclones have long been known to interact with the deeper layers of ocean rather than sea surface alone. Using a coupled ocean atmospheric model, Mao et al., concluded that the rate of intensification and final intensity of cyclone were sensitive to the initial spatial distribution of the mixed layer rather than to SST alone. Similarly, Namias and Canyan observed patterns of lower atmospheric anomalies being more consistent with the upper ocean thermal structure variability than SST.

Following the death of her mother, Du moved in with her aunt. At age eight, Du entered the local women's mosque, where she studied Islam for some six years. In accordance with her father's wishes, at age fifteen, Du got married to a fellow Chinese Muslim scholar. Dissatisfied with her marriage, she nonetheless followed her husband to Shanxi. However, he died of illness after two years; refusing to remarry, Du returned to Kaifeng, whereupon she continued studying at the mosque in the hopes of becoming an imam herself. Her decision was not well received by her family. Career Back in Kaifeng, Du completed her Islamic studies in Persian under the supervision of a female imam.

Functions The agency's main functions involves the gathering, production and dissemination of information on government policies and programmes, locally and overseas. The agency employs a broad range of media skillsets‚Äîprint, radio, television, graphic arts, video projection and public relation‚Äîto achieve its objectives. History =Government Public Relations Office (1956-1963)= The Jamaica Information Service was established in 1956. At its inception, the agency was first known as the Government Public Relations Office (GPRO), which was primarily concerned with issuing press releases and maintaining good relations between the press and the Government. The scope of the GPRO was widened in 1957 when it was integrated with the Jamaica Film Unit and the Government Broadcasting Service. The name of the agency was changed to Public Relations and Information Services to reflect its expanded focus. Subsequently, photography and a publications unit were added to the structure of the organisation. =Jamaica Information Service (1963-1974)= In January, 1963, the GPRO was renamed the Government Information Office (later changed to the Jamaica Information Service), and a television unit was formed. During this period, the JIS focused primarily on writing and distributing press releases and photographs, writing publications, mounting public education campaigns, and producing stories for radio, film and television. The Agency also had a mobile service which showed films in rural communities islandwide. =Agency for Public Information (1974-1980)= On 1 April 1974, under the Michael Manley- led People's National Party administration, the agency was granted a semi- autonomous structure with a nine-member advisory board, chaired by journalist John Hearne, and the name of the organisation was changed to the Agency for Public Information (API). =Jamaica Information Service (1980-present)= In 1980, during the administration of prime minister Edward Seaga, the name of the agency was reverted to Jamaica Information Service. On October 8, 1984, the Seaga government made the Jamaica Press (JAMPRESS) News Agency, which had been suspended since 1980, its official news outlet. JAMPRESS replaced the news-gathering function of the Jamaica Information Service (JIS) and the print news and photography functions of the JIS were turned over to JAMPRESS. The JIS was restructured, with the public affairs (now public relations), radio, television and printing functions remaining within the organization. JIS was retained as a full department of government under the Ministry of Public Service. Executive Agency On April 1, 2001, as part of the World Bank- funded Public Sector Modernisation Programme, the JIS and JAMPRESS were merged to become an semi-autonomous executive agency, headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In addition to providing communication services to all ministries, agencies, and departments of government, as an executive agency, the JIS earns revenue from services offered to government and non-government entities. Departments The agency is made up of seven departments: Editorial; Photography Unit; Public Relations and Marketing; Research & Publications; JIS Radio; JIS Television (JIS TV); and the Computer Services Department, which does web design, advertising, and streaming.

They were formerly a cheap, disposable, hand-made item. However, the widely made espadrille comes in many styles and can include expensive fashion items.  Espadrille  Espadrilles are traditional rope-soled shoes originating in the Pyrenees region of France and Spain. They typically have a sandal-like form with woven straps or else a canvas upper. They were originally made from woven esparto (hence the name), but modern mass-produced shoes are more commonly made from the cheaper jute giving the modern shoe a distinctive bright white colour. Espadrilles are now made in many countries including France, Spain, Italy, and many South American countries. Typically though, manufacturers import pre-made rope soles from Bangladesh, a major source of jute, with the finishing and styling taking place in the local country.Glenn Surabian, Yauo Konishi, \\"Light manufacturing: non-leather footwear\\", ch. 4 in, Sanjay Kathuria, Mariem Mezghenni Malouche (eds), Attracting Investmnet in Bangladesh, World Bank Publications, 2016 Traditional espardrilles made from esparto Woman wearing modern jute espadrilles showing the bright white colour  Bast shoe  Bast shoes Bast shoes are made from bast fibres. They were traditional shoes of the peoples of the taiga forests of northern Europe and Russia. Bast shoes were an item worn by the rural poor; leather was preferred in cities. Bast shoes were time consuming to make. The bark from three or four saplings were soaked in a press for a long period. Despite this, the shoes were somewhat disposable, only lasting a week or so.Natalia Pushkareva, Eve Levin (trans.), Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century, p. 59, M.E. Sharpe, 1997 Bast shoes were used until the mid-twentieth century. They did not always have a rope-like sole as in the picture. Perhaps more commonly they were crudely woven strips of bark.E.A.

Maritime use  Disposable working shoes very similar to espadrilles were at one time worn by sailors, particularly in hot regions. They were hand made on board ship by each sailor individually. The soles and straps were made by the plaiting technique of sennit using rope yarns. Rope and canvas were materials readily available on sailing ships. The practice was definitely still current in the 1940s and may have continued into the 1960s in some places.\\"Rope soled canvas shoes\\", Accession number 1984.327, National Museums Liverpool, archived from the original 2 August 2012.

VSG BOOK Current Situation of River Following closure of River mouth at Puthattinkara in Achanovil river and construction of culverts without any proper study, the flow of water form river to river came reduced or stopped. When the water flow stopped. which was usual for a period of 8 months till 1980's. local habitats started cultivation and encroachment of land some even constructed their houses/structures en route and river bed. Due to unscientific construction of culverts near puthattinkara in achankovil led to frequent floods in the town of Venmoney the reason for floods was attributed to uthrappalli river and river was totally closed by 1992. Mean time, at the other end, the population who always expanding looking for means and living and deprived of water started occupying the river beds and government departments turned a blind eye. IMPLICATIONS in a span of 30 years 50% of river Bed become dry The Population of 107,499 as per 2011 census no longer have access to natural potable/drinking water and agriculture lands around 3000 hectares are under questionable condition. The population around the Utharappalli River become prone to water bourne diseasesa nd even cancer the lab reports of water in wells have quantity of bacteria, and killing people. since 2006, many of the local sensible people started agitating to correct the historical blunder by few people survey for the restoration of river started but completed only in 2 of 5 panchayaths so far. encroachments identified and notices given only in 2 panchayaths Religious importance ‡¥ö‡µÜ‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç ‡¥¨‡¥æ‡¥≤‡¥∏‡µÅ‡¥¨‡µç‡¥∞‡¥π‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥£‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥∏‡µç‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥Æ‡¥ø ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥Ç , ‡¥®‡µÜ‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥∞‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µã‡¥ü‡µç ‡¥Æ‡¥π‡¥æ‡¥¶‡µá‡¥µ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥Ç , ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡¥µ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥Ç ‡¥ß‡µº‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥∂‡¥æ‡¥∏‡µç‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥Ç ‡¥â‡µæ‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥Ö‡¥û‡µç‡¥ö‡µã‡¥≥‡¥Ç ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥Ü‡¥±‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µç ‡¥á‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µã‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥®‡¥ü‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥§‡µç ‡¥Ü‡¥≤ ‡¥™‡¥û‡µç‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡µΩ ‡¥Ö‡¥µ‡¥∂‡µá‡¥∑‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥® ‡¥â‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥∞‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥≥‡µç‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥±‡µç‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µÜ ‡¥®‡µÜ‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥∞‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µã‡¥ü‡µç ‡¥Ü‡¥±‡µç‡¥±‡µç ‡¥ï‡¥ü‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡¥æ‡¥£‡µç . ‡¥µ‡µÜ‡¥≥‡µç‡¥≥‡¥Ç ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥±‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥® ‡¥µ‡µá‡¥≥‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡µΩ ‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥±‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µç ‡¥®‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥ú‡¥≤‡¥Ç ‡¥ï‡¥ü‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µá‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µç ‡¥é‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥£‡µç ‡¥à ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µÜ ‡¥Ü‡¥±‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µç ‡¥®‡¥ü‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µã‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥§‡µç. ‡¥Ö‡¥û‡µç‡¥ö‡µç ‡¥™‡¥û‡µç‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µÅ‡¥ï‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µÜ ‡¥®‡µÇ‡¥±‡µÅ‡¥ï‡¥£‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç ‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥ü‡¥∂‡µá‡¥ñ‡¥∞‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ ‡¥ú‡¥≤‡¥∏‡µç‡¥∞‡µã‡¥§‡¥∏‡µç ‡¥é‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç ‡¥í‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥Ç ‡¥Æ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥ß‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÇ‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µÜ ‡¥™‡µç‡¥∞‡¥∂‡¥∏‡µç‡¥§ ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡¥≥‡µÅ‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥ø ‡¥Ü‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç ‡¥¨‡¥®‡µç‡¥ß‡¥Ç ‡¥â‡¥≥‡µç‡¥≥‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥®‡¥æ‡µΩ ‡¥í‡¥∞‡µÅ ‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥£‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥®‡¥¶‡¥ø ‡¥™‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥µ‡µá‡¥∑‡¥µ‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥â‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥§‡¥∞‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥≥‡µç‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç ‡¥â‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡µç .

Background  As of 31 August 2016, Mungula II refugee settlement had 787 refugees (mainly South Sudanese) but has the capacity to host between 7000-10,000 refugees. Between 2011 and 2012, there was repatriation of the then refugees when the peace agreement was signed in South Sudan but from 2013 to 2016, it had been re-established due to the South Sudan recent conflict of 2015 in South Sudan. Mungula II Refugee Settlement has consistently hosted South Sudanese refugees since it was first established in 1996. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 3.0 IGO (CC by 3.0 IGO) license. As a result, there are close linkages between settlement residents and the neighboring host community. In Mungula II Refugee Settlement, the majority of new refugee arrivals are fleeing to Uganda from Juba, Central and Eastern Equatoria, citing a decreasing security situation and an increasing precarious food availability. Of the new arrivals in Adjumani and Yumbe Districts, majority have been of Ma\`adi ethnicity, followed by Dinka, Nuer, Bari, Acholi, Lotuku, Kuku, Peri and others.  Geography  Mungula II Refugee Settlement has a sitting surface Area of 105 hectares Current population with an average family plot size of 30m x 30m as of 1st March 2018.  Socio-economic activities  In implementing the operational activities of the settlement, there was a need for a strategy for empowering local organizations and people around the camp to carry on activities in the medium and long-term. Development partners initially provided critical support during the South Sudanese refugee emergency. This enabled the refugees to engage in a number of socio-economic activities such as the following:. = Crop farming = Crops grown include maize, ground nuts, cowpeas, tomatoes, millet, cassava, simsim, beans, onions, sorghum and sweet potatoes which the refugees grew to subsidize their standard ration and adds up to their daily consumption rate and supports their food ration that is distributed on monthly bases. = Poultry keeping = Birds kept include hens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeons and guinea fowls which the refugees have engaged into as a way of occupying their daily living and provide other sources of food such as the balanced diet got from the sale or eating of the domesticated animals. = Livestock keeping = Animals kept in the settlement include cattle, goats, pigs and sheep that are either kept on Free Range system or in specified kraals and other structures. The cattle kept is great source of beef and couple as the available source of labor in case farming is necessitated. = Local trading and businesses = Local trading activities include carpentry, brewing and selling local drinks, firewood selling, micro market vending and hunting. The refugees in the settlement camp carry out other business activities such as charcoal burning, brick making, driving, black-smith, construction, iron smelting, rope making, knitting, bee keeping and hand craft making as a way of engaging the young and old create a diversity of reliable money-making activities for their daily livelihood.  Education  Some of the refugees in the camp have enrolled in schools provided by the Ugandan government. There are four schools attended by refugees in this camp. About 1,970 refugees are attending school in or around the settlement, with gross enrolment rates. About 40% of the refugees enrolled are aged 3‚Äì5 while 60% of the learners are aged 14‚Äì17 years. There are two Pre-Primary Schools, two Primary Schools, 17 Secondary Schools, and 1 Adult Learning program (ALP).  Social services  Refugees and the host community reported facing congestion at the water points where the communities often have to queue for over two hours. The refugees lack access to land for agricultural purposes which poses a big challenge to them in case of making necessary supplements to their monthly rations.

Background  The Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928 had prohibited the keeping of petroleum spirit without a licence.Hansard, House of Lords Debates , 01 July 1936 vol 101 cc374-5 Local authorities were empowered under the 1928 Act to grant petroleum-spirit licences, and they could attach such conditions as they thought expedient to such licences. In the case of a change of ownership of premises the licensing authority would transfer the licence to the new occupier. However, legal advice by the Home Office identified that in the absence of any express authorisation in the 1928 Act, there was in fact no power to transfer a licence from a holder to another person. The 1936 Act remedied this defect and gave effect to the proper transfer of licences.  Petroleum (Transfer of Licences) Act 1936  The Petroleum (Transfer of Licences) Act 1936 (26 Geo. 5 & 1 Edw. 8 c. 27) received Royal Assent on 14 July 1936. Its long title is: ‚ÄòAn Act to make provision with respect to the transfer of petroleum-spirit licences granted under the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act, 1928‚Äô. = Provisions = The Act comprised two sections. Section 1 empowered local authorities, and the Secretary of State, to transfer a petroleum spirit licence to another licensee. The Act was retrospective and applied to licences transferred since the passing of the 1928 Act. Section 2 construed the 1936 Act to be one with the 1928 Act and may be cited together as the Petroleum (Regulation) Acts 1928 and 1936.  Later enactments  The Petroleum (Transfer of Licences) Act (Northern Ireland) 1937 (c. 4) was an Act of the Northern Ireland Parliament, which made provision for the transfer of petroleum licences identical to those in the 1936 Act. The 1937 Act is still (in 2020) current legislation. The Petroleum (Regulation) Acts 1928 and 1936 were repealed on 1 October 2014 by the Petroleum (Consolidation) Regulations 2014 (Statutory Instrument, S.I. 2014/1637).

She started her career in France in the 1930s and worked with some of the leading French artists of her day.  Biography  Adant was born in Khabin, Russia and named Elena Mossolova. Having emigrated to France in 1926, she attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. It was here that she met, and later married, the engraver and sculptor, Henri-Georges Adam, in 1930. It was around the time of her marriage that Adant began her career as a photographer. The couple were divorced in 1945.  Career  Adant began her career as an independent photographer working for publications in a variety of fields including art, tourism, museums and the decorative arts. Lydia Delectorskaya, Adant's cousin, was housekeeper and then model to Henri Matisse. It is probable that it was this connection that brought Adant into contact with Matisse. Adant is credited with reports on and photographs of Matisse working in his studio. The 2017 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, 'Matisse in the Studio' and an article, 'Six Secrets from Matisse's Studio' written by Alice Primrose, contain references to images attributed to Adant. Adant's work also included reports, documentaries and photographic portraits, taken in the studio of the printer, Fernand Moulot, of Marc Chagall, Joan Miro, Graham Sutherland and others. The library at the French Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art (INHA) in Paris holds a number of her works, notably photographs of Henri Matisse, her travels to Russia and Russian woodcarvings.  Legacy  Adant has left a sizeable array of photographic images of significant historical and cultural importance. Photographs attributed to her can be found in the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. The main body of her photographic works resides mostly in France. Papers and manuscripts written by Adant on the life and work of Henri-Georges Adam and her own work during the time of their marriage is held at the Kandinsky Library at the Pompidou Centre, Paris, donated by Lydia Delectorskaya.

Promulgated as work regulations, three warfares was set forth in the amended Political Work Regulations of the PLA in 2003.  History  = Political warfare = Political warfare, during the formative years of China, was as much concerned with creating national identity and defeating domestic adversaries as it was with China's ability to compete in the world.Heinlein, Joseph J., Jr. Political Warfare: The Chinese Nationalist Model. (PHD Thesis, The American University 1974), p. 3 Establishing legal justifications prior to military conflict is not new. Since the formation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), casus belli has always been established before military action is taken as was seen in the case of the Korean War, 1962 Sino-Indian War, 1969 Sino- Soviet border conflict and 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. Military action backed by domestic law strengthens PRC's position as is in the case of the usage of the 1992 Territorial Sea Laws in the South China Sea and the 2005 Anti-Secession Law in relation to Taiwan. This diplomatic tradition has now been combined with modern warfare. Psychological warfare has been one of the main responsibilities of the PLA's General Political Department (GPD) since the day it was established, also using it in the Korean War. Media or public opinion warfare combines traditional propaganda techniques with modern day sophistication with regard to, say, deception and perception management. = Information warfare = In the Science of Military Strategy, a PLA publication, it was noted that information systems played a big part in the Gulf War ‚Äì \\"Precision-guided weapons made up only 7 percent of all weapons used by U.S. military, but they destroyed 80 percent of important targets\\".Wortzel, L. (2014). (Rep.). The Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army And Information Warfare. Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College. Retrieved 16 October 2020, from ‚Äî JSTOR A 2007 book, Information Warfare Theory, written by the president of the PLA Information Engineering University, states that information warfare is at the center of China's military reforms. = Three warfares = Three warfares is believed to be inspired from the Zhou dynasty strategist Sun Tzu's book 'The Art of War'; particularly winning without fighting. Laura Jackson, an American China expert, reiterated this when she said that three warfares is aiming to give new understanding to warfare by \\"undermining international institutions, changing borders, and subverting global media, all without firing a shot\\". This doctrine had the approval of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee (CCP) and the Central Military Commission in December 2003 as a guiding conceptual umbrella for political and information operations for the PLA. Chapter 2, Section 18 of the \\"Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army Political Work Regulations\\" sets forth the three warfares, among other political tasks.Dean Cheng (27 January 2011). \\"Testimony before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission: China‚Äôs Active Defense Strategy and its Regional Impact\\". The Heritage Foundation. The three warfares under \\"wartime political work\\" are public opinion warfare, psychological warfare and legal warfare. Following this, three warfares was integrated into PLA teaching programs. Operationally, PLA's General Political Department's Liaison Department (GPD/LD), China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and United Front Work Department are some of the organizations responsible for three warfares.\\"Taiwan and the CCP‚Äôs \\"Public Opinion Warfare\\". pp 41‚Äì42. Li-wen Tung. Taiwan Strategists No. 2. Retrieved on 16 October 2020. China has also incorporated three warfares into local governments and institutions. These work regulations have been revised over time. Recent output from the PLA Academy of Military Science and the PLA National Defence University builds on the three warfares doctrine and expands its roles and methods; this includes texts such as the 2013 PLA Academy of Military Science \\"Science of Military Strategy\\", the 2014 PLA National Defence University (NDU) \\"Introduction to Public Opinion Warfare, Psychological Warfare, and Legal Warfare\\" and the 2015 NDU \\"Science of Military Strategy\\".  About  For PLA, legal warfare in the modern international context is a way to \\"expose the enemy\\", \\"publicize one‚Äôs own humanitarianism [...] win over the universal sympathy and support from the international community‚Ä¶ to compel [the] opponent to bog down in isolation and passivity\\" among other things. With regard to psychological warfare, quoting a PLA strategist Yu Guohua, \\"should sap the enemy‚Äôs morale, disintegrate their will to fight, ignite the anti-war sentiment among citizens at home, heighten international and domestic conflict, weaken and sway the will to fight among its high level decision makers, and in turn lessen their superiority in military strength\\". One tactic of media warfare may be \\"to open for selective study the parts of the PLA that help deliver the message that the GPD and the Propaganda Department want delivered to foreign audiences while concealing other areas of PLA activity\\". = Foreign definitions = According to Abhijit Singh, a research fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA), an Indian think tank, three warfares involves using public opinion (or media) warfare, psychological warfare and legal warfare (lawfare) to \\"weaken its adversaries in regions constituting what it perceives to be its core interests\\" aimed at \\"creating conditions suitable for a resolution of the conflict on favourable terms to China without resorting to physical war\\" or conversely \\"to create the climate and context for the use of force\\". Public opinion or media warfare can include overt and covert media manipulation, while legal warfare or lawfare includes exploitation of national and international legal systems. In 2011, United States Department of Defense defined the three warfares as the following: Anne-Marie Brady, a politics professor at the University of Canterbury, in her book \\"Making the Foreign Serve China\\" has described the tactics used including, = Distraction = Three Warfares has been labelled as a tool for distraction by western analysts, with the aim of distracting from the \\"much larger organizational and operational infrastructure that exists under the CCP\\".  Usage  = Australia and New Zealand = According to Sascha Dov Bachmann, Professor in Law at the University of Canberra, China has since 2000, employed influence operations that have eroded the sovereignty of both Australia and New Zealand. It aims to undermine the integrity of the organic political processes in both countries to manufacture a friendly political environment for Beijing through the use of influence and disinformation campaigns. According to Anne-Marie Brady, the Chinese Communist Party works with the Chinese diaspora as part of a united front strategy to advance Chinese political and economic interests in New Zealand, with goals including cultivating local political leaders in the country. = Belt and Road Initiative = The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project is seen as a key element of the three warfares doctrine, seeking to create a debt-trap for unsuspecting nations and compromise the economic and political sovereignty of these nations. Through bribery and coercion, China has acquired allies and clients within the economic and political elites of these nations, and gets them to promote the acceptance of the BRI project in their respective nations. = Covid-19 pandemic = During the Covid-19 pandemic, China used a vast disinformation campaign that COVID-19 originated outside of China. It used proxy accounts, bots and even Chinese government officials and diplomats to disseminate false stories on social media. For example, Chinese state-run media falsely claimed that COVID-19 had originated in South Korea and Italy. A Chinese diplomat Zhao Lijian shared a theory that a US Army service member had brought the virus to China. The German Interior Ministry also revealed that Chinese diplomats had urged Germany to report favorably on Chins's COVID-19 response efforts. China has also influenced the World Health Organisation to shape and steer its messaging in favour of China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director General consistently praised China's \\"effective\\" response but never criticized China for suppressing whistleblowers and ignoring WHO‚Äôs recommendations on how to stop the spread of COVID-19. = Czech Republic = According to a Czech Republic's counter- intelligence agency Security Information Service (BIS) 2014 report, \\"China‚Äôs administration and its intelligence services have put an emphasis on gaining influence over Czech political and state structures and on gathering political intelligence, with active participation by select Czech elites, including politicians and state officials.\\" =India= According to Abhijit Singh, a research fellow at MP-IDSA a news piece dated 29 January 2013 and carried by China‚Äôs state-owned Xinhua News Agency on the self-immolations by Tibetans, is an example of media warfare. The news story was related to trying to find a judicial \\"Indian connection\\" to the immolations, however the court which was overseeing the case did not give a verdict. The Times of India reported that during the 2017 Doklam standoff China used the three warfares against India. Media warfare was waged with the aim of stopping India from proceeding with its action in Bhutan and belittling Bhutan's claims. China's media and multiple ministries made statements at numerous public forums for the same. Psychological warfare included calling India's foreign minister a liar and asserting that China would change it stance related to the Indian state of Sikkim, and in turn \\"free\\" Sikkim from Indian control. Legal warfare included Chinese statements saying that Bhutan had accepted Chinese claim on Doklam and that the 1890 convention is to be followed while ignoring the 1914 convention. = South China Sea = Since 2013, China has aggressively implemented an effort of land reclamation and fortification of a number of islands in the South China Sea. The reclamation projects and deployment of military assets in the islands shows China's efforts to \\"undermine the psychological ability of the other claimants (Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, and Malaysia) to oppose its own\\". It has also deployed maritime militia in the region to create confusion among the navies of these nations. It has followed an aggressive messaging initiative using diplomatic pressure, news media and other mediums \\"to promote narratives reinforcing the historicity of its claim and warning others to refrain from antagonism\\". China has also consistently attempted to push narratives that show itself as the upholder of international law in the South China Sea region as well as its own interpretations of international law to oppose the other nations' positions and to delegitimize the arbitration process. = Taiwan = China has used three warfares against Taiwan through the efforts of the PLA's former General Political Department‚Äôs Base 311 which oversaw at least six regiments. In peacetime, Base 311‚Äôs employment includes a commercial front, the China Huayi Broadcasting Corporation. = United States = In April 2014, The Pentagon released a report where it said the PLA was using its three warfares strategy and warned of China's use of coercive economic inducements and other non-traditional methods to weaken the resolve of the US and its regional partners to defend the islands and oceans of the South and East China seas. In 2016, the Journal of Strategic Security reported that China uses the three warfares strategy to influence the international community, and the United States in particular, to forestall the development and implementation of any counter strategy to its cyber-espionage campaign which has resulted in losses of $338 billion to the United States. In 2020, the Chinese lawyers sued the United States for covering up COVID-19; this being an example of three warfares being conducted as if it were a military operation. = Xinjiang = The three warfares doctrine has been seen to have been used in Xinjiang even though it is an internal province of China. China's objectives of using three warfares is the implementation of the concept of \\"social management\\" as a means of preserving its hold on power. As a part of this, China implemented a Social Credit System through which it collects and analyses Metadata to shape and \\"score\\" the economic and social behavior of citizens. This scoring system allows for \\"predictive policing\\", enabling the state to make predictive assessments of perceived threats to its authority.  Countermeasures  Countermeasures suggested have included documenting, exposing, publicizing and amplifying Chinese operations and activities including usage of three warfare's. A strategy to combat three warfares, as suggested by Abhijit Singh, a research fellow in MP-IDSA, could focus on, \\"creating awareness\\" about three warfares, detailing SOPs for \\"impact mitigation\\", staying \\"flexible\\" in response, and \\"pre-empting attacks\\".  Commentary  Dean Cheng of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Study Center, an American think tank, warns that the phrase is a misnomer, that many do not take political warfare (media, psychological or law warfare) as real \\"warfare\\". He says that for the Chinese, \\"political warfare [...] is a strategic option that is underway all the time\\".  References  Further reading *Hadrien T. Saperstein (12 October 2020).

He pursued his early career as a reporter for Tamil weekly Thisaikal in 1978. After working for about six months with Thisaikal, he joined the Kumudam magazine as a freelance reporter. He eventually had to change his birth name of Rangarajan to Sudhangan soon after joining the Kumudam group in order to avoid naming confusions with another Kumudam editor Ra. Ki. Rangarajan who had already achieved success in the journalism. He then left the Kumudam magazine and joined the Vikatan group in 1982.

Background A Marawi native, Amai Pakpak maintained a fortification known as Fort Marawi (situated near modern-day Agus 2 hydroelectric dam) which defended the region from Spanish colonizers. While there were presumed to be many instances of Maranao resistance against the Spanish only battles involving Amai Pakpak were recorded; in 1891 against forces sent by Governor General Valeriano Weyler and in 1895 against forces sent by Governor General Ram√≥n Blanco. In the first battle in 1891, Amai Pakpak and his forces held off a Spanish attack in Lanao and suffered heavy casualties. The Spaniards retreated to Iligan after reinforcement from other areas around Lake Lanao arrived. In 1985, Amai Pakpak, together with his family and most of his forces were killed after a fleet of steamships organized by Governor General Blanco arrived in Lake Lanao to secure conquest of the Lanao region. The Spanish withdrew from the area following the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898.

Biography  Born in Sardinia to a Sardinian father (the photojournalist Antonello Zappadu) and an Ecuadorian mother, he grew up in Quito only to return to Olbia when he was 11 years old. His passion for rap led him to follow in Salmo's footsteps, with bands such as Skasico and later To Ed Gein and Three Pigs' Trip, before starting a solo career as El Raton and moving to Milan. The Machete Crew was born from the meeting with Salmo, Enigma and DJ Slait, with the aim of supporting the music produced by young Sardinian rappers, breaking down barriers and spreading it via the web. In March 2011, the music video of Multicultural was launched online, shot entirely in London, the city where he lived and worked for a few years before returning to Italy. In the same year he collected the musical material created over time and selected it in the mixtape Basura Muzik Vol. 1, made available for free; it consists of sixteen songs with collaborations by various Sardinian and non- Sardinian artists.

It is said to have been observed for over 400 years. The Gworok (Kagoro) Hills The word means \\"mountain\\" or \\"hill\\" in Tyap. The large towering hills of Gworok are known as (also styled Oefan Oegworok) among the natives. The glamourous hills are situated at an altitude circa 1,246 meters above sea level. Large trees grow on the hills with a rocky base. The weather of the area is significantly influenced by the hills and the climate is similar to that of the Jos Plateau and the Mambila Plateau, with heavy rainfall in the spring. In the early days, the Agworok people lived in the caves and atop the hill ranges for centuries before gradually settling at the foot of the mountain and finally driven down almost entirely by the British colonialist in the early 20th century although communities yet exist atop the hills. The hills provided the people security from foreign Invaders and also harbours a sacred bee colonies from when we unauthorized invasion is met with bee stings on a victim especially when such a one wears a perfume. History Agworok hunters marching alongside participants of the festival across the town at Agban District in the 2020 Edition. =Pre-modern era= Traditionally, the festival marks the end of crop harvest for the year and the beginning of hunting expeditions. According to Achi in Achi et Al (2019), the Afan festival celebrated by the Agworok every second Saturday of April (now every 1 January) annually is a carry-over of the traditional hunting ceremony carried out by the Atyap, north of the Agworok.Achi, B. Warfare and Military Architecture Among the Atyap. p. 47 The exact date when this festival was began could however not be ascertained, but it is believed to be first held when the Ankwai clan still on the Jos-Bauchi Plateau circa 1500 A.D. An Agworok traditional medicine woman at the Afan National Festival 2020. =Intermediate era= Group functions The Agworok (Kagoro) people are made up of two major kwais (clans) i.e. Ankwai and Kpashang, each with its subclans. The Ankwai is the older group while the Kpashang is the newer clan consisting of migrant groups. For decisions concerning war- related matters, important festivals which involve the kick-starting of the tilling of land in the beginning of each rainy season and brewing of the first pot of beer for the Afan festival, there are subclans among the Ankwai responsible for these functions. The Kpashang clan on the other hand, takes charge of the paramount rulership of the land. Rites Apart from the physical protection that the hills offer the people, they are held with spiritual reverence by them also. To begin the Afan festival, the Chief Priest () climbs up the hills to pray for protection from or , the God of heaven and earth. He afterwards shouts, \\"O Afan, O Afan\\", assisted by his colleagues and the people (who were usually warned to stay away from the hills) respond in like manner. The Chief Priest then sanctifies the hills and very early in the morning on the next day, the hunting expeditions are begun. At the end of the expedition, returning jubilant hunters and indeed the entire village shout, \\"O Afan, O Afan\\" as the hunters approach home where beer () readily prepared in every home awaited each hunter. =Modern era= Much of the cultural and traditional practices of the people were however weakened with the advent of Christianity and Western Civilization which caused the dumping of the activities considered \\"pagan\\" in the Afan Festival especially with the coming of the first Christian Chief of Kagoro, HRH Agwam (Dr.) Gwamna Awan, JP in 1946 who shifted the date of the event to January 1 of every year, on New Year's Day. In the 1982 Afan Festival event, HRH the Agwam Agworok accompanied by over a thousand people and tens of groups of dancing troops was reported to have as early as 9 a.m. rode through the town on horseback, amidst salutations from his subjects, before finally arriving at the palace at 11.45 a.m., where he gave his Afan address, expressing his people's gratitude to God for a beautiful harvest even with the \\"shortfall in rain supply\\". He afterwards took his seat amidst applause and exclamations of, \\"Long live Afan and the Chief\\". One after the other, the various dancing troops then gave their cultural displays. Afan Festival 2016 edition Annually, this festival attracts participants and visitors from the neighborhood and different parts of the country. During the 2016 edition celebrated in a 'lowkey', the Kaduna State government promised a partnership with the Gworok community in development tourism in the area, in a bid to opening up avenues for income generation and employment creation.

Palestine Dream, Faik Bulut  Views on Marco Polo  According to Faik Bulut, what the famous Marco Polo wrote about Order of Assassins does not reflect the truth and what he told in his memoirs: According to Bulut all of the above claims are a 100% false and the opinions of other scientists also support him in this regard. According to Bulut, it has been 15 years since Alamut Castle was destroyed by Mongols at the time Marco Polo claimed to have gone there. German archaeologists, who are conducting archaeological excavations in the region, say that they cannot even find the traces of rivers over which honey, milk or wine flows, concubines and virgins roam, and the castle is not large enough to contain all these.

Believed to be a copycat of Soviet criminal Vladimir Ionesyan, he was thusly nicknamed Mosgaz-2. He hanged himself at his jail cell in Matrosskaya Tishina before he could stand trial for the murders. Early life Born in Tajikistan in 1995, Anushervon was brought up and studied in Moscow from an early age. He came from a modest, hard-working family, which had no trouble with law enforcement. Rakhmanov was described as a handsome, well-dressed young man who often hung out with friends and frequently got tips from girls at his job as a waiter, owning to his knack for complimenting them. After graduating college, he began work as an automechanic. Despite earning a significant income at the job, he felt that spending the rest of his life earning money by fixing other people's cars shouldn't be his faith, and he should instead be partying and picking up girls around the Moscow nightclubs. Since that lavish lifestyle required way more money than he currently earned, he decided that he quickly earn it by committing robberies. Murders In October 2014, Rakhmanov wandered the city center at night, peering through the windows of houses in search of a potential victim he could rob. He stopped in front of a house on Bashilovskaya Street, near the Savyolovsky Railway Station, pressing the intercom button and awaiting the tenant to open the door. Instead of mugging the man, Anushervon thought that it would be safer to rob one of the apartments, and laid in waiting until the man went back to the elevator. He then quickly snuck up the stairs, setting on a random door, putting on his rubber gloves beforehand, and ringing the doorbell. It's unclear under exactly what pretense the owner, a 50-year-old woman, opened the door for him: according to one claim, he introduced himself as a Mosgaz employee, and in another, as a downstairs neighbor. But nevertheless, he was let into the apartment. After inspecting the residence for some time, the woman began to grow suspicious of Rakhmanov, who pulled out a knife and began stabbing her. The victim managed to survive long enough to tell him that there were 140,000 rubles hidden in a cache, which Anushervon stole and then fled the premises. He caught a taxi, bought himself a new jacket and some Spice, and returned to his parents' house, acting as if nothing had happened. By early December, he had spent all of the stolen rubles on Spice and alcohol, with the harsh withdrawal prompting him to go hunting once again. On December 5th, he knocked on the door of an apartment on Nagatinskaya Street, introducing himself as a Mosgaz employee who needed to check the pipe system. He was welcomed in by 52-year-old Elena Zarubina, who felt safe around the stranger, as her husband Anatoly (52), son Alexei (27) and elderly mother Elena were inside with her. Unlike the previous crime, Rakhmanov took his time, chatting with Alexei on the balcony. Then, he took out the knife and stabbed him, before moving on to kill the younger Elena, and finally Anatoly and the elder Elena, who were both fast asleep. After ransacking the apartment and stealing 70,000 rubles, he released one of the gas valves, expecting that an explosion would occur and destroy the evidence, but that didn't happen. Following the brutal murder of the family, Anushervon laid low for two months. Despite the fact that his addictions prevented him from thinking clearly, he was successful in avoiding the authorities, who by then were aware that a serial offender was on the prowl in the city. He managed to obtain a fake passport, and signed into the Sevastopol Hotel, where he would reside until his arrest. In March, he ran eventually ran out of money, and by this time, he addiction to Spice had grown so clinical that he couldn't last a day without it. He travelled to Akademik Vargi Street, in southwestern Moscow, and again managed to enter an apartment while pretending to be a Mosgaz employee. After killing the 65-year-old woman occuyping the premises, he stole 40,000 rubles and burned down the place in an attempt to cover his tracks. However, detectives examined the crime scene and took notice of the footprints left behind by the perpetrator. Using this, and other evidence collected during the investigations, they eventually tracked down Rakhmanov to his hotel room at the Sevastopol Hotel, where he was arrested on March 14th. Death After his arrest, Rakhmanov admitted to all of the killings, in addition to confessing another which was not linked to the series by the investigators. He claimed that his motive was robbery and that the victims were chosen at random, but was incapable of reproducing how he committed the acts, as he was always drugged while doing so. He was incarcerated at Matrosskaya Tishina to await trial, but on April 2, 2015, he was found hanging from his cell. The coroners determined that he had committed suicide.

Resonant interactions occur when a simple set of criteria coupling wave-vectors and the dispersion equation are met. The simplicty of the criteria make technique popular in multiple fields. Its most prominent and well-developed forms appear in the study of gravity waves, but also finds numerous applications from astrophysics and biology to engineering and medicine. Theoretical work on partial differential equations provides insights into chaos theory; there are curious links to number theory. Resonant interactions allow waves to (elastically) scatter, diffuse or to become unstable. Diffusion processes are responsible for the eventual thermalization of most nonlinear systems; instabilities offer insight into high-dimensional chaos and turbulence.  Discussion  The underlying concept is that when the sum total of the energy and momentum of several vibrational modes sum to zero, they are free to mix together via nonlinearities in the system under study. Modes for which the energy and momentum do not sum to zero cannot interact, as this would imply a violation of energy/momentum conservation. The momentum of a wave is understood to be given by its wave-vector k and its energy \\\\omega follows from the dispersion relation for the system. For example, for three waves in continuous media, the resonant condition is conventionally written as the requirement that k_1\\\\pm k_2 \\\\pm k_3=0 and also \\\\omega_1\\\\pm\\\\omega_2 \\\\pm \\\\omega_3=0, the minus sign being taken depending on how energy is redistributed among the waves. For waves in discrete media, such as in computer simulations on a lattice, or in (nonlinear) solid state systems, the wave vectors are quantized, and the normal modes can be called phonons. The Brillouin zone defines an upper bound on the wave vector, and waves can interact when they sum to integer multiples of the Brillouin vectors (Umklapp scattering). Although three-wave systems provide the simplest form of resonant interactions in waves, not all systems have three-wave interactions. For example, the deep-water wave equation, a continuous-media system, does not have a three-wave interaction. The Fermi‚ÄìPasta‚ÄìUlam‚ÄìTsingou problem, a discrete-media system, does not have a three-wave interaction. It does have a four-wave interaction, but this is not enough to thermalize the system; that requires a six-wave interaction. As a result, the eventual thermalization time goes as the inverse eighth power of the coupling‚Äîclearly, a very long time for weak coupling‚Äîthus allowing the famous FPUT recurrences to dominate on \\"normal\\" time scales. Hamiltonian formulation In many cases, the system under study can be readily expressed in a Hamiltonian formalism. When this is possible, a set of manipulations can be applied, having the form of a generalized, non-linear Fourier transform. These manipulations are closely related to the inverse scattering method. A particularly simple example can be found in the treatment of deep water waves. In such a case, the system can be expressed in terms of a Hamiltonian, formulated in terms of canonical coordinates p,q. To avoid notational confusion, write \\\\psi,\\\\phi for these two; they are meant to be conjugate variables satisfying Hamilton's equation. These are to be understood as functions of the configuration space coordinates \\\\vec{x},t, i.e. functions of space and time. Taking the Fourier transform, write :\\\\hat \\\\psi(\\\\vec k) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\vec k\\\\cdot \\\\vec x}\\\\; \\\\psi(\\\\vec x) \\\\;dx and likewise for \\\\hat \\\\phi(\\\\vec k). Here, \\\\vec k is the wave vector. When \\"on shell\\", it is related to the angular frequency \\\\omega by the dispersion relation. The ladder operators follow in the canonical fashion: :\\\\hat \\\\phi(\\\\vec k) = \\\\sqrt {2f(\\\\omega)} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\left(a_{k} + a^*_{-k}\\\\right) :\\\\hat \\\\psi(\\\\vec k) = -i\\\\sqrt {\\\\frac{2}{f(\\\\omega)}} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\left(a_{k} - a^*_{-k}\\\\right) with 2f(\\\\omega) some function of the angular frequency. The a,a^* correspond to the normal modes of the linearized system. The Hamiltonian (the energy) can now be written in terms of these raising and lowering operators (sometimes called the \\"action density variables\\") as :H = H_0(a,a^*) + \\\\epsilon H_1(a,a^*) Here, the first term H_0(a,a^*) is quadratic in a,a^* and represents the linearized theory, while the non-linearities are captured in H_1(a,a^*), which is cubic or higher-order. Given the above as the starting point, the system is then decomposed into \\"free\\" and \\"bound\\" modes. The bound modes have no independent dynamics of their own; for example, the higher harmonics of a soliton solution are bound to the fundamental mode, and cannot interact. This can be recognized by the fact that they do not follow the dispersion relation, and have no resonant interactions. In this case, canonical transformations are applied, with the goal of eliminating terms that are non-interacting, leaving free modes. That is, one re-writes a\\\\to a^\\\\prime=a+\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\epsilon) and likewise for a^*, and rewrites the system in terms of these new, \\"free\\" (or at least, freer) modes. Properly done, this leaves H_1 expressed only with terms that are resonantly interacting. If H_1 is cubic, these are then the three- wave terms; if quartic, these are the four-wave terms, and so on. Canonical transformations can be repeated to obtain higher-order terms, as long as the lower-order resonant interactions are not damaged, and one skillfully avoids the small divisor problem, which occurs when there are near-resonances. The terms themselves give the rate or speed of the mixing, and are sometimes called transfer coefficients or the transfer matrix. At the conclusion, one obtains an equation for the time evolution of the normal modes, corrected by scattering terms. Picking out one of the modes out of the bunch, call it a_1 below, the time evolution has the generic form :\\\\frac{\\\\partial a_1}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega_1 = -i\\\\int dk_2\\\\cdots dk_n \\\\;T_{1\\\\cdots n} \\\\;a^\\\\pm_2\\\\cdots a^\\\\pm_n \\\\; \\\\delta_{1\\\\pm 2 \\\\pm \\\\cdots \\\\pm n} with T_{1\\\\cdots n} the transfer coefficients for the n-wave interaction, and the \\\\delta_{1\\\\pm 2 \\\\pm \\\\cdots\\\\pm n}=\\\\delta(k_1 \\\\pm k_2 \\\\pm \\\\cdots \\\\pm k_n) capturing the notion of the conservation of energy/momentum implied by the resonant interaction. Here a^\\\\pm_k is either a or a^* as appropriate. For deep-water waves, the above is called the Zakharov equation, named after Vladimir E. Zakharov.  History Resonant interactions were first considered and described by Henri Poincar√© in the 19th century, in the analysis of perturbation series describing 3-body planetary motion. The first-order terms in the perturbative series can be understood for form a matrix; the eigenvalues of the matrix correspond to the fundamental modes in the perturbated solution. Poincare observed that in many cases, there are integer linear combinations of the eigenvalues that sum to zero; this is the original resonant interaction. When in resonance, energy transfer between modes can keep the system in a stable phase-locked state. However, going to second order is challenging in several ways. One is that degenerate solutions are difficult to diagonalize (there is no unique vector basis for the degenerate space). A second issue is that differences appear in the denominator of the second and higher order terms in the perturbation series; small differences lead to the famous small divisor problem. These can be interpreted as corresponding to chaotic behavior. To roughly summarize, precise resonances lead to scattering and mixing; approximate resonances lead to chaotic behavior. Applications Resonant interactions have found broad utility in many areas. Below is a selected list of some of these, indicating the broad variety of domains to which the ideas have been applied. * In deep water, there are no three-wave interactions between surface gravity waves; the shape of the dispersion relation prohibits this. There is, however, a four- wave interaction; it describes the experimentally-observed interaction of obliquely moving waves very well (i.e. with no free parameters or adjustments). The Hamiltonian formalism for deep water waves was given by Zakharov in 1968 * Rogue waves are unusually large and unexpected oceanic surface waves; solitons are implicated, and specifically, the resonant interactions between three of them. * Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, describe both the jet-stream and oceanic waves that move along the thermocline. There are three-wave resonant interactions of Rossby waves, and so they are commonly studied as such. * The resonant interactions of Rossby waves have been observed to have a connection to Diophantine equations, normally considered to be a topic in number theory. * During summertime in shallow coastal waters, low-frequency sound-waves have been observed to propagate in an anomalous fashion. The anomalies are time-dependent, anisotropic, and can exhibit abnormally large attenuation. Resonant interaction between acoustic waves and soliton internal waves have been proposed as the source of these anomalies. * In astrophysics, non-linear resonant interactions between warping and oscillations in the relativistically spinning accretion disk around a black hole have been proposed as the origin of observed kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass x-ray binaries. The non-linearity providing the coupling is due to general relativity; accretion disks in Newtonian gravity, e.g. Saturn's rings do not have this particular kind of resonant interaction (they do demonstrate many other kinds of resonances, however). * During spacecraft atmospheric entry, the high speed of the spacecraft heats air to a red-hot plasma. This plasma is impenetrable to radio waves, leading to a radio communications blackout. Resonant interactions that mechanically (acoustically) couple the spacecraft to the plasma have been investigated as a means of punching a hole or tunneling out the radiowave, thus re-establishing radio communications during a critical flight phase. * Resonant interactions have been proposed as a way of coupling the high spatial resolution of electron microscopes to the high temporal resolution of lasers, allowing precision microscopy in both space and time. The resonant interaction is between free electrons and bound electrons at the surface of a material. * Charged particles can be accelerated by resonant interaction with electromagnetic waves. Scalar particles (neutral atoms) described by the Klein-Gordon equation can be accelerated by gravitational waves (e.g. those emitted from black hole mergers.) * The physical basis for macromolecular bioactivity ‚Äî molecular recognition ‚Äî the protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction, is poorly understood. Such interactions are known to be electromagnetic (obviously, its \\"chemistry\\"), but are otherwise poorly understood (its not \\"just hydrogen bonds\\"). The resonant recognition model (RRM) describes such molecular binding in terms of resonant interactions. Given a protein, the valence electrons on various amino acids delocalize, and have some freedom of movement within the protein. Their behavior can be modelled in a relatively straightforward way with an electron-ion pseudopotential (EIIP), one for each distinct amino acid or nucleotide. The result of modelling provides spectra, which can be accessed experimentally, thus confirming numerical results. In addition, the model provides the needed dispersion relation from which the resonant interactions can be deduced. Resonant interactions are obtained by computing cross-spectra. Since resonant interactions mix states (and thus alter entropy), recognition might proceed through entropic forces. * Resonant interaction between high-frequency electromagnetic fields and cancer cells has been proposed as a method for treating cancer.

Rufai was born in Poplar, London, but grew up in Nigeria and California. He is a photographer, poet, filmmaker, mental health researcher, playwright and immersive artist. Over the past five years, Rufai has traveled the globe to share his message. Rufai has done work in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, USA, Ethiopia, Bhutan, Germany, Scandinavia, Mexico, Nigeria and Colombia. Kay Rufai's goal is to engage diverse audiences to raise awareness about mental health, masculinity and community cohesion. Kay's relationship with photography began in 2013, when his friend told him she saw something in him and inspired him to explore that. The arts had always played an important role in Rufai's life, especially as a late teen. He mainly expressed his artistic side through words, but as he got older he learned new outlets.  Projects  = S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys = The S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys Project was created as a direct response to a rise in youth stabbings in London around 2017-2018 which led to a series of government approaches regarding increased criminalization of youth and police presence in minority communities. Kay was inspired by this to investigate the mental health provisions for the black youth community. He also wanted to remind the public that these are young boys, even though they are often treated as men. Rufai's project involved trips to Scandinavia and Bhutan to explore why these countries are ranked in the top 10 happiest countries in the world and have been for the past decade. The factors Rufai uncovered were used to design 6-month-long photography, poetry and discussion- based art projects with 30 BAME boys between the ages of 13 and 25 from Lambeth. This project also produced a critically acclaimed poetry album, Boy And A Bike (Miseducation Of Black Youth). In 2018, Rufai received ¬£32,000 from the Wellcome Trust in order to travel to Scandinavia and develop a number of workshops around the eight pillars of happiness. Around 30 boys were then recruited from three schools (now seven schools) in London after being identified by their teachers as the most disengaged. Over the course of eight weeks, the boys were given cameras to photograph the aspects of their lives that were working for or against their level of happiness. After this documentation, the boys then discussed the photos together and talked about the aspects they have control over versus the ones they do not. Rufai wanted to create a safe space for these boys to discuss issues they generally do not talk about. The results from this project were displayed in a number of exhibitions. In 2019, Kay was funded by the Arts Council to deliver the S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys exhibition and workshops at The Battersea Arts Centre during the Occupy Festival. This exhibition documented the boys' stories through poetry, photography and creative writing pieces. In the fall of 2019 at City Hall in London, Kay Rufai displayed 16 large-scale color photographs of teenage boys. All 16 pictures show each individual boy smiling in a state of pure happiness and relaxation. For another exhibition, Kay Rufai partnered with Brixton Village and had these photographs displayed across Marker Row for 12 weeks, beginning on March 12, 2020. This installation displayed 25 portrait flags hanging above the street for all visitors to see as they walk by. Kay was able to use this location as a spot for an outdoor exhibition due to the Coronavirus lockdown. Brixton Village has said that as the year continues, the S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys Project will host a series of events and begin a partnership. Rufai also returned to the three schools the boys came from to display the photographs for staff and students to see. = S.M.I.L.E = The S.M.I.L.E project is an ongoing Wellcome Trust funded project using photography, poetry and multimedia to display the smiles of diverse people in Europe. S.M.I.L.E stands for Send Me Inspiring Loving Energy. Rufai wants to show people from a range of religions, races, ethnicities, gender and socio economic statuses. Rufai is aiming at challenging the stereotypes diverse people face every day in society and the perceptions attached to different groups. Rufai's photographs capture people's reasons for smiling and what would make them smile more. The project also aims at exploring the effects smiling has on mental health and people's overall wellbeing. Included with these photographs is a video interviewing the subject. Kay asks them two questions: What makes you smile? And what do you think would make you smile more if you had the power to make it happen? The S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys Project is an extension of this project. = T.R.I.B.E = T.R.I.B.E stands for Testing Realities Invariably Binding Everyone. This project uses photography and poetry to feature images of rarely photographed tribes from the remote regions of Southern Ethiopia. In addition to the photographs, this project also features poems and videos to document Kay's time with these tribes. The goal of this project is to reveal the commonalities across the human race and challenge the stereotypes imposed on different groups. The results of this project are compiled into a book available for purchase. In an interview with Arise News, Rufai mentions how a driving force behind this project is that he wants to inspire others who may not have the opportunity to travel and experience other cultures. The opening night of this project hosted around 80-100 people and featured live drama and artistic reenactments of the tribes. The exhibition for this project was at the Espacio Gallery in Bethnal Green from March 15 to 20 in 2016. = S.T.R.E.N.G.T.H = Upcoming, S.T.R.E.N.G.T.H stands for Showing True Resilience Empowering New Generations To Hope. This project will explore the livelihood of the Egun people of Makoko, Lagos. These people's homes have been under constant threat of demolition and resettlement due to the migration from Cotonou to Lagos for more economic prospects. This project will also study the homeless communities in Skid Row, California and shed light on their resilience and strength, despite their challenging living conditions.  Achievements  Kay was shortlisted by the House of Parliament to be the commissioned art-in-residence for the commemoration and celebration of the Race Relations Act in Britain. He was also funded by the British Council to deliver a month-long residency in San Diego, California using photography as a way to explore community cohesion and cultural awareness. He was to focus on young people in gangs and juvenile prisons as well as refugee communities across the Tijuana, Mexico Border. Rufai's award-winning S.M.I.L.E-ing Boys project was featured in the Guardian, The Voice, BBC, and the local press.

Known for making a profound statement from simple concepts, Frohardt works to escape tradition by creating detailed, often humorous, constructions and performances. Career =Style= Frohardt constructs her sets for films and plays completely from cardboard. She also uses plastic, wood, cloth, and other recycled materials to make puppets and installations. Some of her puppets are realistic people while other objects take abstract forms from her imagination. Frohardt uses Bunraku-style puppetry, most famously in her show The Pigeoning. Bunraku is a traditional Japanese form of performance that involves puppeteers, chanters, and musicians. =Themes= Environmentalism is the primary theme in Frohardt‚Äôs work, specifically in Bag Movie, The Plastic Bag Store, and Dumpster Monster which all focus on the prevalence and permanence of human waste. Work =Major exhibitions= The Plastic Bag Store was an installation in the form of a fully stocked grocery store. Created to look realistic, all products are hand crafted from single-use plastic. This exhibition, open and free to the public to browse during the day, transformed into a three act live puppet performance at night with original music by Freddi Price. By giving her audience their waste as food, Frohardt makes an environmental statement by reminding her audience that humans can never really throw away trash. She tells the journey of plastic waste and what it might mean for the future. Criticizing mass consumption, Frohardt created The Plastic Bag Store with humor and satire to confront challenges in a capitalist society. It was awarded the Creative Capital Award in 2016 and before COVID-19 was scheduled to reappear in March of 2020 in Times Square. The Pigeoning is a puppet show that debuted at HERE Arts Center in 2013 about an obsessively clean office worker, Frank, who is disturbed by pigeons who he believes are plotting against him. It won the Arlyn Award in 2014 for Outstanding Design in Puppet Theater and was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Best Music in a Play for its original music by Freddi Price. Dumpster Monster is a 10 minute puppet performance including audience participation centered around a creature constructed entirely of trash that explodes from a dumpster. It debuted in 2015 at The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center. Bag Movie, Fitzcardboardaldo, and The Corrugation of Dreams, are three of Frohardt‚Äôs cardboard short films. =Collaborations= Frohardt created puppets for Anna Fitch and Banker White‚Äôs documentary film Heaven Through the Backdoor. She designed the sets for Nick Jones‚Äôs play Jollyship the Whizbang. She worked on the additional set pieces for a theater piece on the subway titled IRT: A Tragedy in Three Stations by Jeff Stark. She designed the snack bar and ticket booth for Jeff Stark and Todd Chandler‚Äôs installation Empire Drive-In. She was a puppet designer for the play Salt of the Earth by Zvi Sahar. Frodardt worked with Dream Community as a director and creator of floats, costumes, and puppets in the Dream Parade in Taipei, Taiwan. She designed puppets for the New York and Norway based puppet company Wakka Wakka. = Other experience = Along with other artists Kirk Lombard, Freddi Price, Ben Burke, Jesse Roadkill, Duskin Drum, and Caryl Keintz, Frohardt founded Apocalypse Puppet Theater which ran from 2005 to 2010. Combining their talents, the artists built puppets and wrote plays for the mobile theater that ran out of a wagon pulled by bikes. Frohardt worked with the Cardboard Institute of Technology from 2008 to 2012 to make cardboard installations. =Awards and honors= 2019, Made In NY Women‚Äôs Fund Grant Award 2018, Guggenheim Fellowship 2016, DisTIL Fellowship at UNC 2016, Olson Kundig Artist in Residence 2016, Creative Capital Award for ‚ÄúThe Plastic Bag Store‚Äù 2016, Jim Henson Foundation Project Grant 2016, Residency at The MacDowell Colony 2016, Jim Henson Foundation Seed Grant for ‚ÄúThe Plastic Bag Store‚Äù 2014, Mid-Atlantic Arts Fund USArtists International Grant Award 2014, Arlyn Award for Puppet Design for ‚ÄúThe Pigeoning‚Äù 2013, Peggy Irvine Foundation Award for Artistic Excellence 2013, Artist in Residence St. Anne‚Äôs Warehouse‚Äôs Puppet Lab 2012, Jim Henson Foundation Project Grant for ‚ÄúThe Pigeoning‚Äù 2012, Artist in Residence at HERE Arts ‚ÄúDream Music Puppetry‚Äù Program 2011, Artist in Residence St. Anne‚Äôs Warehouse‚Äôs Puppet Lab References External links * Izzyolavarria/sandbox's webpage * Collection of Izzyolavarria/sandbox's works Category:Living people Category:American women artists ","title":"Robin Frohardt"},{"id":"65312535","text":"Iv√°n Bravo Castro (born 20 January 2001) is a Spanish footballer who plays for RCD Mallorca B as a left back.

Early life and education He received a Bachelor in Fine Art and a Bachelor of Arts in French Literature from The University of Virginia Commonwealth in Richmond, Virginia in 1987. In addition, he also attended school at The University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona and received a Master in Fine Art in 1995. Residency Sale was a Lucas Arts fellow during the dates: June 20, 2016- July 4, 2016; June 1, 2017- July 2, 2017; June 1, 2018- June 30, 2018; October 29, 2018- October 20, 2019 Career = Style = Sales career revolves around the concepts of bringing together opposed constituencies of the criminal justice system from incarcerated men and women, to families and survivors, correctional officers, and community members. He has worked with incarcerated persons such as juveniles in Pennsylvania sentenced to life without the parole option as well as those in Tennessee sentenced to death row. Sale also does work within the fluid parameters of public and private love, another politically debated issue between opposing views. Through these issues he aims to reduce divisions and barriers between the disagreeing sides of each argument to provide a setting for mutual learning addressing both sides of each issue and argument. Sale's work has been supported by Creative Capital, Art Matters, and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. =Themes= Gregory Sale expresses different themes throughout his work, most stemming from issues within the justice system including criminal justice reform, education, and social justice. =Work/ Job Career= Sale is an Associate Professor of Intermedia and Public Practice at Arizona State University. At this school, Sale teaches classes such as Art and Community, Honors Directed Study, Honors Thesis, Individualized Instruction, and other courses. Work =Projects= Sale has created and been a part of several Social Art projects over the course of his career in the Social Practice Art field. Some of these include: * _Future ID‚Äôs At Alcatraz (November 2018- September 2019_ _)_ \\\\- A project based at Alcatraz Prison is Sales best known work. It is about the transformation of one who was incarcerated into someone new, a much better version of their old self. On these IDs, the recipient puts a goal of theirs after getting out such as getting a new job, caring for their family, or a role in society they would like to have. Although none of these incarcerated persons involved in this project were ever actually at Alcatraz (closed in 1963), it still stands for the stigma those incarcerated persons face upon rejoining society.The initial goal of this project was to prioritize social impact over artist recognition and media communication. Sale worked with core project collaborators such as Dr. Luis Garcia, Kirn Kim, Sabrina Reid, Jessica Tully, and many others on this work. One example of this is an ID made for Emiliano Lopez, consisting of a self-portrait he drew, his full name, and his purpose upon release. Current Inmates involved in the project have said that this project gives them an identity and a sense of hope. The Future IDs program‚Äôs focus on expression helps the creator of the card(who is incarcerated) to heal the trauma of dehumanization experienced during incarceration and regaining self worth. Creating a Future ID helps the current inmate to find greater clarity about his identity and to expand and know his future life once not in prison anymore. * _Rap Sheet to Resume(2015-2016)-_ 14 individuals with conviction histories participated in professional development training and learned artistic strategies to expand how they perceive and present themselves. Together, the participants and Sale produced a public program for the Urban Justice Center which is an organization supporting New York City‚Äôs most vulnerable residents. * _It's not just black and white (2011)-_ Analysis describing social and personal issues at stake in the everyday workings of the justice system. What began as a collaboration with 14 men incarcerated, eventually grew to 52 related events, 37 institutional and community partners, and reached nearly 20,000 visitors. The purpose of the project was to expose and examine the many conflicting viewpoints, perspectives, and values that give rise to serious considerations of justice and public safety. * _Touching Revolution(2015)-_ Performed through virtual platforms such as Skype, this project brought together activists, artists, and communities to create a platform for reform in the criminal justice system to confront and rethink issues. Participators for the event virtually dialed in from all over the country. * _Beware! Artwork Ahead!(2012)_ \\\\- A proposal for visible tomorrows which is a project that is designed to disrupt the social mechanisms on an individual level that often appear to destine the youth for a life of incarceration behind bars. Sale led the workshop to deliver the message that incarceration does not have to be the future for the youth in foster homes, those with a criminal record, and those that are homeless, each of which puts the child at higher risk for being put in a cell later along in life. * _Love for Love(2012-2015)-_ A series of projects designed to describe the word love without using love to describe it. Due to love being such a complex word with several different opinions ranging from person to person, it often is hard to define and take seriously for certain people. The series has emerged as a social justice project, a social political campaign to foster dialogue, promote awareness of less visible segments of society, and show acceptance and tolerance among the population. * _Things We'd Rip Off(2008)-_ This project was done on the campus of Arizona State University, where Sale teaches. He interviewed different colleagues in the art department through a survey in which they were suppose to reflect what they believe students should be taught. The conversation sparked a conversation on the values that support individual artistic practice while also questioning values of to contemporary art school training. =Awards and nominations= His work has received support from a variety of platforms such as: * Creative Capital * Art Matters * SPArt (Social Practice Art) * Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts * Prestigious residency awards at Yaddo, MacDowell Colony, Headlands, Montalvo and Centre d‚ÄôArt Marnay.

Painted right after Floris' return from his trip to Italy, the painting depicts a biblical scene, the Judgment of Solomon. In that story, King Solomon of Israel ruled between two women who both claimed to be the mother of a child. Solomon revealed their true feelings and relationship to the child by suggesting that the baby be cut in two, with each woman to receive half. With this strategy, Solomon was able to determine the non-mother as the woman who backed this proposal (saying, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it), while the actual mother begged that the sword be sheathed and the child committed to the care of her rival (O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him!) Painting In Antwerp there was a similar work by Jan Massijs, but it was destroyed during one of the Spanish Furies, the one which devastated the city of Antwerp in 1576. Afterwards, Jan van Asseliers donated The Judgment of Solomon by Frans Floris as a replacement to Antwerp's City Hall (whose design is generally attributed to Floris' brother, Cornelis Floris). The painting is one of the earliest works by Floris after his return from Italy. This is reflected in the attention to details and clothing. The story, from the Old Testament, is moved to ancient Rome. Typical of Floris' early work is the overcrowded composition with figures that are rather stiffly next to each other in the foreground without any openings to the depth. They have an unmoved facial expression with no individual characteristics. Solomon's palace is in the form of a colonnaded hall overlooking ancient ruins. The figures were inspired by Raphael, with whom Frans Floris became acquainted in Rome. The painter tried to reproduce the ancient architecture and clothing as accurately as possible on the basis of his studies from Italian albums of drawings. From thence the dating of the painting to 1545-1550 (ca. 1547), when the artist had just returned from Rome. The painting is currently housed at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp.

Poillon was a 19th century shipyard company in Brooklyn, New York. The company employed over 300 workers, owned several shipyards, and launched 175 vessels. The company was the last of the wooden hulled boat builders in New York. Company history USS Winona Baton Rouge Richard Poillon, born in New York in 1817, was a partner in the firm C. & R. Poillon shipbuilders. He learned the profession from his father who first owned the shipyard. In 1845, he and his brother, Cornelius opened an office at 224 South Street, New York City, with a lumberyard and saw mill. C. & R. Poillon was in attendance at a 1855 meeting of shipowners, merchants, and shipbuilders, held in New York City, to discuss the adoption of a resolution to increase the pay to $2.50 per day for shipyard services. =Bridge Street shipyard= In 1858, the brothers purchased a new shipyard on Bridge Street in Brooklyn. The Bridge Street shipyard offered services for building, designing and repairing all types of vessels. The shipyard also did a wholesale business in spars, planks, knees decking, and treenails. =American Civil War= During the American Civil War, C. & R. Poillon built ferry boats and steamships for civilian firms and gunboats. The gunboats USS Winona (1861), USS New Berne (1862), and USS Grand Gulf (1863) were built for the United States Navy. The company built the steamship Ajax (1864 ship) in 1864 to provide logistical support to the Union Army on the Atlantic coast during the Civil War. After the war, the Poillon brothers continued to build steamers, naval vessels, pilot boats and yachts. =Pilot boats, yachts, naval vessels= Stebbins-Coronet-1893-08-07 In 1867, the yacht Sappho was built by C. & R. Poillon, which was an America's Cup defender. In 1872, they built the Japanese warships Capron and Kuroda, the first warships constructed for the Japanese government. On August 12, 1875, the pilot-boat E. C. Knight was launched from the C & R Poilon shipyward at the foot of Bridge Street. The New York pilot boat Alexander M. Lawrence was designed in 1879, for Captain Michael Murphy. She was one of the largest and fastest in the Sandy Hook fleet. In 1881, the schooner, Norseman was designed by William Townsend and built at the C. & R. Poillon shipyard for Ogden Goelet, who was a real estate developer. The yacht Coronet was built for oil tycoon Rufus T. Bush in 1885. In 1890, the pilot-boat David T. Leahy was launched at the C & R Poillon shipyard and witnessed by fifteen hundred people. James D. M. Beebe was part-owner of the boat. =Other boat launches= =Gowanus shipyard= After Cornelius died on July 11, 1881, James O. Poillon and his cousin, Richard Pease, joined the shipyard. In 1882, a second shipyard was purchased in the Gowanus Basin in Brooklyn, at the end of Clinton Street. In 1862, Richard and his wife Mary purchased a house on No. 36 East 38th Street, New York. After Richard died on July 4, 1891, his wife lived there until her death in 1901. The property was sold to Middleton S. Burrill.

It is located in Sturgeon County northeast of Edmonton, Alberta, in Alberta's Industrial Heartland. Ownership and organization The Sturgeon refinery is owned and operated by the private consortium, North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP), a joint fifty/fifty venture between North West Refining and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. The NWRP/Sturgeon Refinery Contractual and Ownership Structure consists of three main parties who entered into a public private partnership agreement‚ÄîCanadian Natural Resources, North West Refining Inc and the Government of Alberta's Crown corporation, Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission (APMC). According to their agreement as described in the 2018 report by the Office of the Auditor General of Alberta, the APMC‚Äîwhich is responsible for the implementation of Alberta's Bitumen Royalty-in-Kind (BRIK) policy and processing agreements, has a financial obligation to supply 75% of feedstock to the refinery, take on 75% of the funding commitment of toll obligation, and 75% of subordinated debt. The toll obligation which the pays, is a processing fee or toll for each barrel of bitumen refined. This includes an operating toll, a debt toll, an equity toll, and an incentive fee. The original assessment included a capital cost cap of $6.5 billion. In return, APMC can collect Bitumen Royalty-in-Kind (BRIK) when the refinery is fully operational. Under the agreement, Canadian Natural Resources Partnership (CNR), which is 100% owned by Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), and which has 50% ownership of North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP), provides 25% of feedstock and 25% toll obligation. North West Refining Inc. owns the other half of North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP) through two subsidiaries‚ÄîNorth West Upgrading LP (NWU) and North West Phase One Inc. The North West Redwater Holding Corporation and the NWR Financing Company Lts are both 100% owned by North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP). A February 2018 report by the Office of the Auditor General of Alberta entitled \\"APMC Management of Agreement to Process Bitumen at the Sturgeon Refinery\\", said that the original agreement between the Alberta government and North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP) resulted in the province taking on \\"many of the risks as if it were building the refinery as a 75 per cent tollpayer in this arrangement\\". The APMC has only one vote representing 25% of decision-making power in the partnership, while the two private companies together hold 75% of the decision-making power. In contrast, in regards to the $CDN26 billion in toll payments to be made over a thirty-year period APMC is responsible for 75% while CNRL is responsible for the rest. Because of the \\"unconditional nature of the debt component of the toll payments\\", a \\"substantial amount of the risk was transferred to the province\\" when APMC entered into these agreement. The AG's report described the arrangement between Alberta's provincial government and the NWRP, as \\"high-benefit\\" and \\"high-risk\\"‚Äîa \\"$26 billion commitment on behalf of the government to supply bitumen feedstock to the NWR Sturgeon refinery over a thirty year period.Following the publication of the AOG's February 2018 report, TransCanada cancelled the Energy East Pipeline project which was the second high-benefit, high-risk public private partnership arrangement between the Government of Alberta and the energy industry. See AOG 2018:1 When the Department of Energy and the APMC acknowledged that taking bitumen-in-kind was neither \\"practical or cost-efficient\\", the APMC entered into contracts with bitumen suppliers to provide the 75% feedstock to fulfill their commitment to the refinery. In effect, the APMC is purchasing bitumen instead of collecting bitumen-in-kind royalties. During construction, the APMC CEO and some staff managed the contract itself; NWRP, with its 400 staff members, oversaw the actual construction and \\"risk management activities\\".Richard Masson served as APMC CEO from 2012 until 2017 when Mike Ekelund replaced him. Peter Watson was APMC chair in 2011, Jim Ellis from 2012 until 2014, Grant Sprague from 2014 to 2016 and Coleen Volk from 2016. See OAG 2018:24 Alberta‚Äôs Industrial Heartland The 2017, Alberta‚Äôs Industrial Heartland Association's website, listed NWRP's Sturgeon Refiner as one of the major energy projects in the Heartland‚Äî\\"Canada‚Äôs largest hydrocarbon processing center\\" with over forty companies. The Heartland's geographic region encompasses its 5 five municipal partners, the City of Fort Saskatchewan, Lamont County, Strathcona County, Sturgeon County, and the City of Edmonton. =Carbon capture and storage (CCS)= According to Global News, the $CDN1.2 billion, Alberta Carbon Trunk Line System (ACTL), a -pipeline which came online on June 2, 2020, is part of NWRP's Sturgeon refinery system. The ACTL is a \\"major carbon capture project\\", according to the NWRP, and is the Alberta's \\"largest carbon capture and storage system\\". The ACTL, which was partially financed through federal government programs and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), is owned and operated by Enhance Energy and Wolf Midstream.Funding included up to $CDN305 million from CPPIB, $CDN63 million from the \\"Government of Canada's \\"Federal EcoETI Program and the Federal Clean Energy Fund Program\\". Alberta approved \\"$CDN223 million in \\"construction funding\\" through Alberta's Carbon Capture and Storage Funding Act (2009). See https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/enhance-energy-and-wolf- midstream-sign-agreement-to-finance-and-construct-the-alberta-carbon-trunk- line-689941641.html Newswire 2018] The ACTL captures carbon dioxide from industrial emitters in the Industrial Heartland region, like the Sturgeon refinery, and transports it to \\"central and southern Alberta for secure storage\\" in \\"aging reservoirs\\", and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. Products According to NWR Sturgeon refinery's website, operations include upgrading bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands into ultra-low-sulfur diesel. Other finished products include \\"high quality recycled and manufactured diluents\\" used in the process of extracting bitumen in Alberta, \\"pure naptha\\", used in \\"petrochemical processes or as part of the manufactured diluent pool\\", \\"low sulphur\\" vacuum gas oil (VGO)\\", that can be used as \\"intermediate feedstock in refineries\\", butane, and propane. Background The September 18, 2007 Alberta government commissioned report, entitled \\"Our Fair Share\\", by the Alberta Royalty Review panel had concluded that bitumen royalty rates and formulas had \\"not kept pace with changes in the resource base and world energy markets\\" and as a result, Albertans, who own their natural resources, were not receiving their \\"fair share\\" from energy development. In 2008, the global price of oil reached its peak all-time high of $USD145 a barrel, but later in 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, oil prices had plummeted to $32 a barrel resulting in \\"the cancellation of many energy projects\\" in Alberta.Oil projects that shut down in 2008, had not resumed by 2015 In response to Review, which the then Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach had commissioned, the Alberta government enacted new regulations under the provincial Alberta Mines and Minerals Act at that were identified in the Alberta Royalty Framework. The 2007 Alberta Royalty Framework identified the need for a Bitumen Royalty-in-Kind (BRIK) option, allowing the government to choose how the Crown could collect its bitumen royalty share of \\"conventional crude oil production\\"‚Äîin cash or in kind. Through BRIK, the Crown could use its share of bitumen royalties \\"strategically\\", to \\"enhance Alberta‚Äôs value-add activities such as upgrading, refining, and petrochemical development\\", to Alberta's economy, and to hedge risks in the commodity market. Under the new royalty formulas, the government had anticipated revenue of $2 billion annually. On July 21, 2009 Stelmach's provincial government released a BRIK Request for Proposals (RFP) to \\"procure a long-term contract to process or purchase a share of royalty volumes of bitumen\\". The only proposal was that submitted by North West Upgrading LP (NWU). After receiving a report from the NWU proposal evaluation team in April 2010, which warned that the agreement placed a \\"disproportionate risk\\" on Alberta's government, the NWRP and AMPC agreement was signed in February 2011. A private consortium North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP) was \\"selected to construct and operate\\" the Sturgeon Refinery. Originally the estimate for capital costs for the project was $5.7 billion By 2011, the estimate had increased to $6.5 billion. In 2012, the construction of Phase 1 of the Sturgeon Refinery was sanctioned. In its announcement, NWRP said that the refinery was to be built, owned and operated by NWRP. Originally, the Sturgeon upgrader was supposed to be fully operational by October 2016. In January 2014, under then Premier Jim Prentice, the Building New Petroleum Markets Act was passed, allowing the Minister of Energy to provide loans to projects, like the NWRP's Sturgeon Refinery. When the APMC, the NWU and CNRL reached an amended agreement in April 2014, the APMC providing a $CDN324 million loan to NWRP. By May 2017, the expected completion date was delayed until June 2018. As a result, the Ministry of Energy updated the estimate for the refinery's capital cost to $9.4 billion. The delay and resulting cost increases represented an additional $CDN95 million loan to NWRP by the APMC. In 2017, Sturgeon Refinery began producing diesel from synthetic crude upgraded Alberta oilsands feedstock, and by November 2018, was producing about 35,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of diesel. The heavily discounted price of \\"stranded Alberta heavy oil\\" resulted in deep discounts for the refineries feedstock‚Äîas much as US$30 per barrel less than usual. In 2017, NWRP proceeded with phase one of the refinery capable of upgrading bitumen at a rate of 50,000 barrels a day. with the cost estimated at $CDN9.7 billion. Because of the onerous obligations under the agreement, in June 2018, the provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) under Premier Rachel Notley, had to begin to pay \\"pay 75 per cent of the debt- servicing costs related to financing of the project.\\" Even though no revenue had been generated for Alberta by the Sturgeon Refinery, the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission (APMC)‚Äîa Crown corporation responsible for the \\"implementation of BRIK policy, processing agreements\\", had \\"been making payments averaging $27 million a month related to the financing\\" the $9.9-billion Sturgeon Refinery, which represents approximately \\"$466 million in debt-servicing costs\\" since 2018‚Äîtied to the government's \\"commitments\\" to the project. By March 2020, due to start up issues, the refinery was not \\"processing the government‚Äôs bitumen at the facility ‚Äî or generating revenue for the province from its refining operations\\" according to a Calgary Herald article. By March 2020, the capital costs of the project had climbed to about $10 billion. It took fifteen years, but in May 2020 founder, president and CEO of North West Refining, Ian McGregor, announced that the Sturgeon Refinery was fully operational and had reached commercial operations, as the transition from \\"primarily processing synthetic crude feedstock to bitumen feedstock\\" had been successful. Because of the agreement made by the former Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta government with North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP) in 2009, the current United Conservative Party (UCP) provincial government is responsible for continuing the debt-servicing costs that have been paid since June 2018, as well as an added cost of \\"debt principal repayments of about $21 million a month, on top of the debt- servicing costs,\\" starting in June 2020. This increase in payments comes against the backdrop of the collapse of global oil prices precipitated by interconnecting and unprecedented global events‚Äîthe 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the coronavirus recession, the 2020 stock market crash, and the 2020 Russia‚ÄìSaudi Arabia oil price war, which Premier Jason Kenney called‚Äî\\"the greatest challenge\\" in Alberta's \\"modern history, threatening its main industry and wreaking havoc on its finances.\\" APMC reported in its annual 2020 report on the loans and agreements with NWRP's Sturgeon Refinery project, that the NWRP's Sturgeon Refinery project, had a \\"negative $CDN2.52 billion net present value\\" based mainly on \\"pricing and on-stream factor\\".

Mother Praxedes worked throughout the Southwestern and Western areas of the United States building and improving churches and schools. She is known for updating the constitution for the order of the Sisters of Loretto, helping to build the school now known as Webster University and for founding the Loretto Academy in El Paso, Texas.  Early life and education  c. 1870s.alt=Susan Carty c. 1870s.left Mother Praxedes was born in Bawnboy in 1854 and was named Susan Carty. She was one of eleven children. In Bawnboy, she listened to the Parish Priest who advocated for helping others. Because of that, as a child, she became a guide to a blind woman, named Moira. In 1865, the family emigrated to St. Louis. In Cape Girardeau, she was impressed by the Loretto School and the sisters who worked there. Her family moved to Loretto, Kentucky in 1874. Her mother and father returned to Ireland. Susan Carty entered the novitiate in Loretto, Kentucky in 1874. She took on the name of a Roman martyr, Praxedes, though she wasn't happy about the choice. Sister Praxedes contracted tuberculosis and was sent West to Santa Fe in 1875. The trip to New Mexico took place over thirteen days riding in a wagon and part of the way by ship. Two other nuns riding with Sister Praxedes died during the trip, one from cholera and the other was described as dying of fright after their caravan was attacked by Native Americans. In Santa Fe, Sister Praxedes finished her novitiate training. She took her vows as a Sister of Loretto with Bishop Jean Baptiste Lamy.  Career  St. Genevieve Church in Las Cruces, New Mexico, dedicated on October 15, 1887. Praxedes went to Bernalillo, New Mexico in 1877 as a superior. In Bernalillo, she demonstrated her skills as a good manager. She was also responsible for the girls' school. In Bernalillo, she learned to speak Spanish. She was sent to Las Cruces, New Mexico in 1879 as the Mother Superior to the Loretto Academy of the Visitation. The academy was $5,000 in debt and unfinished. Mother Praxedes raised money for the academy and forced parents through the court system to pay delinquent tuition. She planted a vegetable garden so that the sisters and boarders could save money on food costs. She forged relationships with influential members of the city of Las Cruces. Mother Praxedes also worked to raise money through bazaars and other fundraising sales. The first bazaar held in April 1881 may have been the first to take place in the Southwest. Mother Praxedes ended the academy's debt and made further improvements. In 1886, Eugene Van Patten, the tax assessor sued the Las Cruces Loretto Academy, claiming that the sisters were using the building for profit, rather than charity. Mother Praxedes testified in court about the vegetable garden and other aspects of charity the group was involved with. Also in 1886, she helped rebuild the church of St. Genevieve, raising more than $3,000 for the cause. The church was dedicated on October 15, 1887. Mother Praxedes was sent to Florissant, Missouri for a year in 1893 then in 1894, she went to Loretto Heights outside Denver. She helped build a school at St. Mary's in Denver. Here, she helped prevent the foreclosure of the land the school was built on by negotiating an extension of the loan with the mortgage holders. Against the rules of the Order, she was appointed, rather than voted, Mother Superior of all of the Society of Sisters of Loretto in 1896 and went back to Loretto, Kentucky. In 1899, she toured the country, visiting convents and schools of the Loretto Order. Mother Praxedes and the Mistress of Novices went to Rome in 1903 and brought a new constitution for the Sisters of Loretto to the Pope. Mother Praxedes and the Mistress of Novices spent their time studying in Rome while they waited on the Pope's decision. The new constitution was viewed by Pope Pius IX in 1904 and put to a three-year trial. After this Mother Praxedes returned to the United States. In 1905, she went to Las Cruces where a new school was being planned. Shortly after that trip, she became ill and spent several weeks in recovery in Michigan. For part of 1907, she toured Loretto schools and convents in the Western states, starting in Missouri. Later, she went back to Rome in 1907 during which the new constitution was fully approved. In January 1908, she returned to the United States again. She spent time visiting the Las Cruces academy again in 1909, where she was welcomed with a program featuring music and choir song. In July 1910 she was re-elected as mother general of the Order. Mother Praxedes began to work on rebuilding the Loretto Academy and beginning work on St. Paul Academy in St. Paul, Kansas in October 1914. In July 1916 she was re-elected as mother general of the Order. Also in July, Mother Praxedes started working on the Loretto College for Women in St. Louis, Missouri, which is now known as Webster University. During the 1918 flu pandemic, Mother Praxedes sent sisters to work as nurses into places that needed assistance. On July 28, 1921, Mother Praxedes celebrated the 25th anniversary of her election as Mother General of the Loretto Order.  Later life and death  Construction of Loretto Academy in El Paso in 1922. Mother Praxedes came to El Paso, Texas in the early 1920s to help start a girls' school. In El Paso, Mother Praxedes chose the Austin Terrace area of El Paso to build her school, Loretto Academy. She worked with Gustavus A. Trost to create plans for the building. She bought 19 acres of land in the area on March 20, 1922. The location was far from the downtown area and good water sources. Residents of El Paso and the local bishop didn't initially believe that parents would want to send their children to the school located there and many called the project \\"Praxedes Folly.\\" In 1923, she officially retired, but stayed on in El Paso to continue to supervise the construction of the academy. Classes began on September 11, 1923. However, while the school opened, not all of the buildings were completed until the 1930s. In 1927, the Catholic Students' Mission Crusade awarded their highest distinction, the Grand Cross of the Paladins, to Mother Praxedes. Morther Praxedes went to St. Louis in 1931, where she went to secure an $80,000 loan for the academy. While she was there, she was injured in a fall, which would lead to later illness and complications. Mother Praxedes became ill in 1932. She died on December 16, 1933. Her funeral services were held on December 18 at Loretto Academy with hundreds in attendance. Mother Praxedes' body was returned to Loretto, Kentucky for burial. A novel based on Mother Praxedes' life, Only One Heart, by Sister Patricia Jean Manion was published in 1963. In 2001, Mother Praxedes was named to the Hall of Honor by the El Paso County Historical Society.

First published in 1656, it is considered by literary critics as one of Cowley's greatest poems. Synopsis The poem celebrates the life of Richard Crashaw, who is described as \\"Poet and Saint\\". The narrator suggests that Crashaw's poems have a heavenly quality. He remarks that his \\"songs\\" bring poetry \\"nobly back to their Holy Land\\" and that they will be sung with the angel \\"ayres divine\\". Analysis David Trotter writes that the opening lines single \\"(Crashaw) out from the throng of profane poets\\", whereas throughout the rest of the poem, Crashaw \\"saintliness\\" is contrasted with the \\"weaker‚Äîsometimes false‚Äîcodes\\" and \\"relative homelessness\\" of the narrator. For instance, the narrator expresses his \\"despair at the single dimension of modern concerns\\" due to the use of the \\"weak parenthesis\\" in \\"(Vain men!)\\". N. K. Sugimura suggests that Cowley \\"may well have been paying homage to how Crashaw lived appropriation of Counter-Reformation spirituality had succeeded in raising his particular strain of English devotional poetry.\\" The poem also alludes to the Catholic \\"shrine\\" in Loretto at which Crashaw worked as a Catholic poet for merely three months before his death; Crashaw had previously been secretary to Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta under the recommendation of Henrietta Maria. Publication history Richard Crashaw died on 21 August 1649. According to Cowley's biographer Arthur Nethercot, \\"On the Death of Mr. Crashaw\\" was only written some two years after Crashaw's death. It was originally composed on a single sheet of paper measuring ; the sheet was folded into half and the poem occupies three of the four pages. The completed elegy was included as the final and most recent poem in Miscellanies, published in 1656. Reception The elegy has been considered to be one of Cowley's \\"finest poems\\". According to Jelena Krostovic, it is \\"universally admired for its stately mood\\". Reportedly one of his \\"clear personal favourites\\" among the poems in Miscellanies, Samuel Johnson wrote that it \\"apparently excels\\" all the other poems in the collection, adding that it contains \\"beauties which common authors may justly think not only above their attainment, but above their ambition.\\" John Buxton called the poem \\"sensitive and judicious\\". In Epistle III of An Essay on Man, Alexander Pope denounces religious partisanship. He writes that one \\"can't be wrong whose life is in the right\\", alluding to Cowley's \\"tolerant\\" comment in \\"On the Death of Mr. Crashaw\\" that Crashaw's Catholicism may have \\"harmlessly diverged\\" from Cowley's \\"Mother Church\\": \\"His Faith perhaps in some nice Tenets might/Be wrong; his Life, I'm sure, was in the right\\".

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1966 and election as Laramie County Clerk in 1970. Early life Bill Nation was born in Lingle, Wyoming, in 1925. During World War II he served as a gunner aboard a destroyer under Admiral William Halsey Jr.'s command. He married Jo Ann Petersen, with whom he had four children. Career =Mayor= Elections Prior to entering politics Nation was a professional photographer. In September 1959, Nation announced that he would run for the mayoralty of Cheyenne, Wyoming and was the first person to do so. However, incumbent Mayor Worth Story and state senator R. J. Keelan were the finalists in the primary and Story would later defeat Keelan in the general election. In 1961, Nation ran for mayor of Cheyenne, placed first in the primary ahead of incumbent Mayor Story, and defeated Story in the general election. On September 30, 1963, Nation filed to run for reelection, placed first in the primary, and won in the general election. Nation announced that he would not seek reelection in 1965, and was succeeded by Bill Herbert Kingham. Nation announced that he would seek election to the mayoral office on September 12, 1967, but placed third in the primary behind former Mayor R. E. Cheever and state legislator George R. Cox. On October 6, 1969, Nation filed to run in the mayoral election, but was defeated in the general election by incumbent Mayor Floyd Holland. In 1972, Nation defeated incumbent Mayor James Van Velzor by five votes in the mayoral election, which was the smallest margin of victory for any Cheyenne mayor. Nation announced at a press conference on July 21, 1976, that he would seek reelection. During the general election campaign he spent $936 against Don Erickson's, who was endorsed by the Cheyenne Central Labor council despite being a Republican, $988.42. In the general election Nation was defeated by Erickson. In 1980, Nation ran for the mayoral office, placed second in the primary, but lost to incumbent Mayor Erickson in the general election. Tenure In 1962, Nation was elected to the board of directors of the Wyoming Association of Municipalities alongside other mayors and local officials in Wyoming. In 1963, he was selected to serve as vice-president of the organization. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy Nation proposed naming Cheyenne's airport after Kennedy in December 1963, but later chose to not introduce the proposal. In 1974, Nation rejected an attempt by the American Nazi Party to establish a national headquarters in Cheyenne and called for other residents of Cheyenne to write to the American Nazi Party to express their views on the proposal. In 1973, the Model Cities Program in Cheyenne had charges of discrimination filed against it by the Cheyenne Local Development Corporation due to its budget being decreased and had been investigated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Nation and Gerald Iverson, the director of the Model Cities Program, denied that there was discrimination, but the city was found guilty of discrimination on June 11. =Other political offices= In 1964, Nation was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives as one of eleven members from Laramie County as a member of the Democratic Party. In 1965, he was appointed to serve on the Revenue, City and County Affairs, and Welfare, Buildings, Institutions, Sanitary and Medical Affairs committees. On March 9, 1967, Governor Stanley K. Hathaway appointed Bill Nation as one of nine members of the Wyoming Recreation Committee. On March 8, 1966, Nation announced that he would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. On May 10, he selected Kermit D. Glover, who had served as Nation's campaign manager for his mayoral and state legislature campaigns, as his gubernatorial campaign manager. In the Democratic primary he was defeated by Ernest Wilkerson. On July 7, 1970, Nation filed to run for Laramie County Clerk and won the Democratic nomination, but lost in the general election against incumbent Republican clerk John B. Huisman.

History  The unit was created at the beginning of February 1937 in Grullos, from the CNT n¬∫3 battalion, being assigned to the 1st Asturian Division. The command of the Brigade fell to V√≠ctor √Ålvarez Gonz√°lez, who received military advice from Pedro Mart√≠nez Coll. On April 27, the brigade set out with the 213rd, 216th and 230th battalions to the Vizcaya front, now under the command of the Joaqu√≠n Burgos Riestra. Upon its arrival in Vizcaya, it was added to the 2nd Basque Division, placing two of its battalions in Amorebieta and another in Miravalles. During the fighting of the Battle of Bilbao, on June 13 the unit was practically destroyed in the vicinity of the so-called \\"Belt of Death\\" ‚Äîthe last of the defensive lines that protected Bilbao. Its remains, however, managed to withdraw and later return to Asturias. On August 6, the unit renamed the \\"183rd Mixed Brigade\\", within the 57th Division of the 16th Army Corps, giving command of it to Jos√© Penido Iglesias. After the start of the Asturias Offensive the 183rd MB was sent to Colombres, with the mission of defending the coastal highway, being added to Division ¬´A¬ª (provisional). On September 5, the Republicans lost control of Llanes, so the brigade was withdrawn from the front, towards Mieres, to join Division \\"C\\". Penido Iglesias was dismissed and replaced by √Ångel L√≥pez Bonachela. Towards October 5, the unit was covering the front of the mountain passes, on the heights of \\"El Pedrusco\\", \\"El Castillo\\", \\"Altocena\\" and \\"Busdrugo\\", but an advance of the nationalist forces of Antonio Aranda led them to the Campo del Caso, causing the isolation of the republican forces; all the brigade troops were taken prisoner, and the unit disappeared. ;Recreation The numbering of the old 183rd MB was adopted by a new brigade that was created on April 30, 1938, within the 49th Division of the 20th Army Corps ‚Äîwhich, in turn, constituted the general reserve of the Central Region Army Group (GERC).

It was first described by the Danish missionary and naturalist Otto Fabricius. Description Tonicella marmorea is broadly oval and grows to a length of about . The eight plates of which the shell is composed are smooth and glossy, reddish-brown, marbled or patterned with intricate pale brown or white zigzag lines. The girdle which surrounds the shell is wide, thin and leathery, and also reddish-brown. Round its margin are small, flattened spines in red, purple or green, sometimes with paler bands. There are 17 to 25 pairs of gills, usually in the posterior part of the mantle groove, but sometimes scattered along the groove. On the ventral side is the yellowish muscular foot, with the mouth at the anterior end and the anus at the posterior end. In the northwestern Atlantic the colouring may vary. Distribution and habitat This species occurs in the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes the eastern coast of North America, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, and Britain, where it is largely confined to Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. It is quite common in Scottish sea lochs, and it has been common in Strangford Lough, but is becoming less so. It lives on rocks, and on and under pebbles at depths from the littoral zone down to about . Ecology Tonicella marmorea has a strong muscular foot that enables it to grip the substrate firmly; the plates have individual bundles of muscle fibres and this allows it to conform to the irregularities of the rock surface. If it becomes detached from the substrate, it can roll itself defensively into a ball. It lacks eyes or sensory organs on the head, but instead has aesthetes on its plates and girdle; these are sensory organs and function as a dispersed, compound eye. Beneath the mantle, cilia on the gills create a water current for respiration, and this current also carries away waste products. In its feeding habits, the chiton resembles a gastropod, grazing on algae with its reinforced radula. However, it differs from a gastropod in having a long, coiled gut, and forming faecal pellets, which pass out with the water current. The sexes are separate in this species. The gametes pass out with the water current and are liberated into the sea. In many chiton species, the timing of liberation of gametes is synchronized with the phase of the moon and the tides. The larvae are planktonic and when sufficiently developed, settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles without passing through an intervening veliger stage.

Densford was Director of the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, serving in that position from 1930 to 1959. Densford‚Äôs leadership of Minnesota‚Äôs flagship school of nursing, located in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area provided the model for nursing education throughout the state and nation. Her pragmatic leadership during World War II made a significant contribution to the United States war effort. Early life Katharine Jane Densford (1890 ‚Äì 1978) was born in Crothersville, Indiana in 1890. In her late teens, she was hired by a family friend to teach fourth, fifth and sixth grades at a girls‚Äô ‚Äúindustrial school‚Äù which was a boarding school for girls as young as eight years old, who were termed ‚Äòdelinquents‚Äô, located in Indiana. Besides teaching the full curriculum for those grades, she also instructed in ‚Äòmanual training. She earned her B.A. degree, magna cum laude, at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio and then earned her M.A. in history at the University of Chicago, Chicago. She returned then to teaching, first Latin and German at a high school in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and then History for several years in a Bismarck, North Dakota high school. The outbreak of World War I caused her to evaluate how to best serve her country, and she decided to become a nurse. Professional nursing career By 1920, she graduated from the ‚ÄúVassar Training Camp for Nurses‚Äù where she completed an intensive three-month educational program. Next she earned a two-year clinical nursing degree at the School of Nursing and Health of the University of Cincinnati. . In 1925 she transitioned away from bedside nursing practice to education leadership. She become the Assistant Dean of the Illinois Training School for Nurses (program merged in 1926 into the University of Chicago's School of Nursing and ceased to exist in 1929) biographi.ca where she also taught public health and tuberculosis nursing, and gained leadership experience. . She also served as Assistant Dean and Associate Director of Nursing Service for the Cook County Hospital in Chicago. In 1930 she became Professor and Director of the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, a tenure that lasted until she retired in 1959 . The University of Minnesota (UMN) was the world's first school of nursing within a university , and Densford continued and expanded the nursing program at UMN throughout her tenure, based on a set of policies she established early on the defined the quality of the program. Nursing education otherwise had been following an apprenticeship model and was conducted exclusively in hospital settings. During her tenure, School of Nursing faculty began providing bedside instruction, ensuring that students learned from the most-prepared people available. In response to the Great Depression In response to the high unemployment rates for nurses during the Great Depression in the 1930‚Äôs, Densford collaborated with hospitals and the university to create a ‚ÄúLearn and Earn program.‚Äù In that program, nurses worked in the clinical practice area (without compensation) while enrolling in university courses tuition-free, earning credits to apply toward baccalaureate and advanced degrees, and getting room and board free within that program as well. Densford‚Äôs focus on finding and retaining talent resulted in a number of important hires in the 1930‚Äôs, including Cecilia Hauge, Mildred Hodgkins (later known as Mrs. John Coe), Mildred Montag, Frances Lucier, Ruth D. Johnson, Julia Miller and Ruth Harrington. During 1937-1938 Densford and Hauge went for 6 months to Europe, to attend the International Council of Nurses ICN meeting in London. Lucile Petry took her place as acting director. Densford had been with the ICN since 1929, and continued to be active in it the rest of her career. She also travelled in Russia during that period, and took further training at Teachers College, Columbia University. Densford continued throughout the 1930‚Äôs to improve the School of Nursing‚Äôs programs in terms of content, teaching and patient care. . Powell Hall was opened in October, 1933 as a 300-unit dormitory for student nurses, which connected by tunnel to Elliot Hospital, the UMN hospital site at the time. Nursing leadership during World War II Densford released Hauge and Petry and many others for direct war services in leadership positions, who were replaced by bringing back retired nurses, local sourcing, and having all faculty increase their teaching load. Cecilia Hauge was chief nurse for University Base Hospital Unit 26, serving at multiple locations around Europe. Lucille Petry went to Washington to work with the Surgeon General to help facilitate nursing education around the county. Ruth Harrington went to D.C. to serve with the National League of Nursing Education As early as August 1940, the UMN School of Nursing under Densford‚Äôs leadership started planning for creation of Base Hospital, Unit 26. As of October of that year, the designation was official, and efforts began to locate and recruit 120 nurses. In January of 1942, Hauge and her team officially went on war footing. The University of Minnesota‚Äôs United States Hospital 26 left for Oklahoma with 50 doctors, 7 dentists, and 108 nurses in February, 1942. Densford then turned to recruiting nurses for the war effort. Densford made nationwide appeals encouraging women to becoming nurses, stressing the war-time need for nursing as well as the permanent peacetime opportunities. The Bolton Nurse Training Act passed by congress in June, 1943 provided federal funds for housing and training costs of educating nurses, and created the Cadet Nurse Corps. Opened in July, 1943, by November her program was honored nationally for enrolling the most nurses of any institution in the country. Densford managed to find housing for these large numbers of students, find classroom space (including at Northrop Auditorium), and find teachers ‚Äì despite most trained faculty having gone to war themselves already. Due to the extreme need for students, Densford and the University were able to use federal funds from the Bolton act to partially fund an addition to Powell Hall. While class sizes increased and instruction was accelerated to get students into the field as soon as possible, remaining faculty also served on civil defense committees and took on additional training responsibilities in the area of home health. By January 1945, the wartime need for nurses was critical. General Norman T. Kirk, Surgeon General of the Army, characterized the shortage as the most critical since Pearl Harbor. Hospital units were going overseas with no nurses aboard. The ratio of nurses per enlisted men in overseas military hospitals had dropped from 120 per 500 to 83 per 450. At the same time, U.S. civilian hospitals were caring for 60 to 70 patients at a time with a nursing staff of only one nurse and one assistant. President Roosevelt announced that due to the urgent need, he wanted to mobilize greater numbers by use of forced induction. Nationwide reaction included concern from many communities that were already operating despite drastically reduced nursing staff. The shortage was caused in part by mixed messages from the military and Red Cross on the need for nurses, many nurses had gone to private nursing after being turned away from active service. In some communities, sufficient nurses to meet quota had already signed up and were on waiting lists for physical examinations or assignments. Densford testified as head of the American Nurses Association (ANA) before the House Military Committee in February of 1945 that sufficient nurses were already available, but that bureaucracy had hindered their progress. That the numbers of nurses willing to volunteer would be available if the War Manpower Commission, or another government department were given the power to make necessary changes. She also suggested that black nurses and male nurses be given the opportunity to serve their country. In testimony before the Senate Military Affairs Committee in March, Densford stated that nurses who have applied for military service had waited as long as seven months for assignment. The draft bill stalled in the senate and was later withdrawn. By June of 1945 the U.S. Army directed the Red Cross to stop taking applications, as they had all the nurses they needed from voluntary enlistment. Post-war: racial justice and professional advancement Densford was president of the American Nurses Association (ANA) from 1944 to 1948. During her presidency, the American Nurses Association hosted the International Council of Nurses in 1947 at Atlantic City. The Ninth ICN Quadrennial Congress - attended by 700 nurse representatives and over 5,000 delegates representing 250,000 nurses in 32 countries - was a major step forward in re-establishing international peacetime relations in the healthcare community. Densford was in charge of all arrangements (along with Ella Best, Secretary) which included locating lodgings for attendees among local residents, and raising funds to cover travel costs. Also during her term the ANA enacted a five-point program to increase the number of nurses in the US. Densford was active throughout her career in many nursing organizations. She was president of the Minnesota League of Nursing Education, president of the Minnesota Nurses Association, second vice-president of the International Council of Nurses (1947-1957), president of Alpha Tau Delta, National Fraternity for Professional Nurses (1936-1938) and president of Sigma Theta Tau, International Honor Society of Nursing (1941-1945). She also chaired the first fund-raising campaign for the American Nurses Foundation after retiring. In 1984, Densford was inducted in to the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame. Personal life The day after her retirement in 1959, she announced her engagement to Carl A. Dreves. She died in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1978 and is buried in Acacia Park Cemetery, Mendota Heights, Minnesota. Writings * Densford, K.

Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera sought to overthrow Salvadoran President Gerardo Barrios, citing his attacks on the Catholic Church in El Salvador during his presidency as justification. Barrios was overthrown on 26 October 1863 and was replaced by a conservative politician, Francisco Due√±as, ending the war.  Background  On 12 March 1859, General Gerardo Barrios overthrew Salvadoran President Jos√© Mar√≠a Peralta and declared himself President of El Salvador. The coup and ascension of Barrios to power caused many conservative politicians to flee to Guatemala for safety. = Barrios-Carrera rivalry = Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera was a conservative politician while Barrios was a liberal politician and both ruled as dictators of their respective countries. Barrios passed anticlerical legislation in El Salvador to dimish the power and influence of the Catholic Church while Carrera made agreements with the Church to expand its influence and uphold its privileges. Carrera initially supported Barrios believing that a strong ruler in El Salvador would be in his best interests, even visiting San Salvador from December 1860 to January 1861 to improve relations. However, in the following years, Barrios began attacking Carrera calling him a \\"savage\\" while Guatemalan newspapers attacked Barrios' \\"lameness and pomposity.\\" The Guatemalans later labeled the war as a war over religion when it was really a political and ideological war. Salvadoran bishops did, however, support the Guatemalans in the conflict, as did Salvadoran conservatives.  War  = Battle of Coatepeque = In 1862, Carrera began plans to topple Barrios from power and instal a conservative as President. On 13 February 1863, Carrera invaded El Salvador. He took control of the settlements of Ahuachap√°n, Chalchuapa, and Santa Ana, later establishing a headquarters in Jes√∫s de los Milagros de Coatepeque. On 22 February, the Salvadorans, lead by Barrios, entrenched themselves in the town of Coatepeque and prepared for battle. After two days of battle, the Salvadorans won and forced the Guatemalans to retreat. = Siege of San Salvador = After his initial defeat, Carrera invaded El Salvador a second time on 19 June 1863. During the invasion, many Salvadorans deserted and either refused to take part in the war or joined the Guatemalans, most notably general Santiago Gonz√°lez who served under Barrios during the Battle of Coatepeque. Salvadoran conservative politicians, such as Francisco Due√±as, also supported the Guatemalans. On 30 September, he began a siege of the Salvadoran capital city, San Salvador. Carrera ordered a cease fire from San Salvador to submit, and after a month of being sieged, the capital fell on 26 October. Barrios fled the city and went east to San Miguel, after which, Due√±as was declared President of El Salvador. The fall of San Salvador marked the end of the war.  Aftermath  Carrera died on 14 April 1865. Barrios fled for exile in Nicaragua but he was arrested on 27 July 1865 and extradited to El Salvador. He was court-martialed on 10 August and sentenced to death on 28 August. Barrios was executed by a firing squad on 29 August 1865.

During his excavations in 1933, the researcher Fritz Frank stated that he believed the ruins were those of Ezion-Geber.Fritz Frank: From the Arabah, I: Tell el-ChleTi. In: Zeitschrift des Deutschen Pal√§stina-Vereins (1934) 57, pp. 243‚Äì45. During his excavations from 1938 to 1940, American archaeologist Nelson Glueck adopted the same thesis. He distinguished five settlement periods, which he dated to between the 10th and 5th centuries BC. In 1985, Gary Pratico presented a comprehensive reassessment of the architectural and ceramic finds. Particularly in the case of ceramics, he came to a shorter dating of the settlement through comparative studies with numerous other sites from Israel and Jordan. According to his results, a two- phase colonization can be assumed. It is a fortress from the 8th century BC. And subsequently a fortified settlement that lasted until the 6th century BC, such that the equation with the biblical Ezion Gezer of the 10th century was not proven.

More than two-thirds of this conflict zone lies at an altitude above 2,000m, rising to 3905m at Mount Ortler. In 1917 New York World correspondent E. Alexander Powell wrote: ‚ÄúOn no front, not on the sun-scorched plains of Mesopotamia, nor in the frozen Mazurian marshes, nor in the blood- soaked mud of Flanders, does the fighting man lead so arduous an existence as up here on the roof of the world.‚Äù Geography of the front = The front line = alt=Battisti - Il Trentino, cenni geografici, storici, economici, 1915 59.jpgalt=Alpine front, 1915-1917 At the outbreak of the war, the border between Italy and Austria-Hungary was as determined at the Treaty of Vienna (1866) at the conclusion of the Third Italian War of Independence. Along this border one section, the Trentino, offered major advantages to Austria-Hungary. Extending southwards towards the River Po, it potentially allowed Austrian forces to strike towards the lower Adige and Mincio, cutting off Veneto and Friuli-Venezia from the rest of Italy. Another section, much smaller, favoured Italy around the Kreuzberg Pass and the headwaters of the Drava. In practical terms however, the road and rail systems did not allow the Italian commander Luigi Cadorna to mass his forces here, so instead he concentrated on the Isonzo front further East, where he hoped to make a decisive breakthrough. From Bovec on the upper Isonzo to the Swiss border at the Stelvio Pass stretched around 400km of border at an altitude above 2,000m. Halfway along this border, between the Trentino and the Kreuzberg, rose the Dolomites, that offered little strategic advantage to either side. Between Switzerland and Lake Garda the Ortler, and the Adamello-Presanella Alps controlled the Stelvio Pass and the Tonale Pass. From here the Austrians could have broken through to threaten the industrial cities of Lombardy, while the Italians could have penetrated deep into the Tyrol. In fact neither side developed major plans for this sector, and once the passes were closed and both sides maintained a static posture. = Logistical challenges = Italian soldiers haul their cannon up a mountainside Italian soldier using a cableway to reach extreme positions The major challenge for both armies was to sustain modern warfare in such a hostile environment. The difficult terrain meant supplies had to be brought up on the backs of pack animals or of the men themselves, including heavy artillery and munitions. As the conflict developed a network of roads, must tracks and pathways was established, reaching even the most remote places. Eventually cableways were built too, and this building work itself was difficult, dangerous and exhausting. In the high mountains, temperatures vary widely: above 2,500 meters, temperatures below zero are normal even in summer. In winter, during the war, temperatures as low as -35¬∞ were recorded. All year round the weather can change rapidly and storms are common. Finally, the winters of 1916 and 1917 brought some of the heaviest snows of the century, with the mountainsides often under 8 metres of snow, three times the annual average. This made it extremely difficult for the troops to stay at high altitudes, forcing the men to continually dig and clear the snow because of the risk of avalanches. Heinz Lichem von L√∂wenbourg stated: \\"On the basis of unanimous reports from fighters of all nations, the rough rule applies that in 1915-1918, on the mountain front, two thirds of the dead were victims of the elements (avalanches, frostbite, landslides, cold, exhaustion) and only one third victims of direct military action.\\" Servicing the troops on the front line required enormous manpower. To maintain a garrison of 100m on a 3,000m peak, 900 porters were required, working in relays. The waste of resources was enormous too - in one location Italian gunners fired 950 rounds to drive 12 Austrian soldiers off a small turret of rock. Military forces = Kingdom of Italy = On the western edge of the front, deployed from the Stelvio Pass to the Cereda Pass, Italy positioned the 1st Army under General :it:Roberto Brusati based in Verona, spread over an arc roughly 200km long as the crow flies or about 300km on the ground. The III and V Corps were deployed under the command of Generals Camerana and Aliprindi, and mixed with the troops of the fortress of Verona, under the command of General Gobbo. The III Corps occupied the western side of the Trentino salient, from Stelvio to Lake Garda. The 6th Division was deployed on the border while the 5th was the reserve of the III Corps. To the south, between Garda and the Lessinico plateau, were the troops of the fortress of Verona, while the V Corps with the 9th, 34th and 15th divisions was positioned at the :it:Passo Tre Croci and the Cereda Pass, defending the Trentino salient with the 35th Reserve Division near Brescia. The 4th Army was deployed on the Dolomites sector under General Luigi Nava, based in Vittorio Veneto, which its forces from the Cereda Pass to Mount Peralba, over about 75km as the crow flies, and about double the distance on the ground. The :it:Cordevole sector, between the Pale di San Martino and the Rocchetta di Pelmo, was garrisoned by the IX Corps under the command of General Marini with the 17th and 18th Divisions serving on the front or in reserve. The Cadore sector, between the :it:Valle del Boite and the sources of the Piave, came under I Corps of General Ottavio Ragni, with the 2nd and 10th Divisions deployed close to the border and the 1st Division in reserve. Unlike the Cordevole sector, however, the troops of the Cadore sector could count on the substantial fixed defenses of the Cadore-Ma√® Fortress. = Empire of Austria-Hungary = An Austrian patrol in the highest mountains of the Tyrol The war in the Tyrol On the Austro-Hungarian side, General Viktor Dankl von Krasnik took command of the defense of Tyrol at the start of hostilities, based in Innsbruck. His field of operations stretched from the Stelvio Pass to the Croda Nera, located on the Carnic watershed just a little east of Forcella Dignas. This meant it was roughly facing the 1st and 4th Italian Armies. The region was divided into five sectors, called ‚Äòrayons‚Äô. part of General Scholz's 90th Division, composed of eleven battalions, was assigned to sectors I and II, from the Stelvio to Pres√®na, with support from the fort at Gomagoi on the Stelvio route and modern artillery placed to defend the Passo del Tonale. The III sector ran from the Adamello to the Pale di San Martino, and was the responsibility of the 91st Division made up of about thirty battalions, under the General K√∂nnen-Horack, while one brigade controlled the garrison of the strongholds of Riva del Garda and Trento under General Guseck. This defensive system around Trento was of great strategic importance, and was divided into four sub-sectors, Lodaro, Lavarone, Rovereto and Pergine Valsugana, which had modern fortifications and various defensive works. The IV sector, from the Pale di San Martino to Mount Padonit was held by the 90th Division, with a mountain brigade of seven battalions. The V sector, from Mount Padon to the Croda Nera, was held by a mountain brigade of nine battalions. The massing of the Italian 4th Army meant that on May 27 this sector was removed from the 90th Division and made partially autonomous under the command of General Ludwig Goiginger and with three reinforcing battalions until the arrival of the German Alpenkorps, whose commander Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen assumed command of the Tyrol and the responsibility of the IV and V sectors. He retained this until 14 October, when, having withdrawn the Alpenkorps from Alto Adige, he handed over to General Roth von Limanowa. =Balance of forces= Despite their numerical superiority, the Italian forces did not take the offensive on this front. The Italian commanders lacked intelligence about the strength of Austrian numbers, had no detailed plans for a campaign and were also averse to risk. The Austrians were equally unprepared to take the offensive. In the decades before the war resources had been directed mainly to Galicia on the Russian front, and in 1915 the objective was simply to hold off any Italian invasion. As chief of staff, Conrad had also neglected the defence of the Dolomites in favor of a strengthening his position on the Asiago plateau, as a base from which to attack the Veneto. As a result, the defences that opposed the Italian 4th Army were second-rate compared to those of Trentino. In the first days of the war, instead of trying to maintain old strongholds Commander Goiginger had his men retreat and distributed the artillery around the surrounding mountains. By spreading their guns over isolated positions on the slopes and peaks, the Austrians exploited the Dolomite terrain very effectively, securing every possible advantage in an attempt to confine the Italians to the lower valleys and prevent them from accessing the strategic passes. = Fortifications= The Austrian fortress of Mitterberg nearSexten/Sesto The peacetime defence doctrine of Austria-Hungary assumed that not an inch of land was to be conceded to an invader, and on this basis fortifications had been built up right on the border itself. However at the beginning of the hostilities the Austrians did not have sufficient forces to be able to maintain them. They therefore withdrew to defensive positions behind the border that gave them the advantage of high ground wherever possible and shortened their defensive lines from around 500km to about 400km. In contrast the Italians followed the practice of locating their fortifications well behind the border, meaning they had no role in the fighting in the Dolomites. An Austrian advance near Agordo would have been met at the fort of Listolade, while the Cadore was defended by the Chiusa di Ven√†s and the fort of Monte Rite, as well as by numerous concealed artillery positions. On the Austrian side, Ampezzo and Cadore Dolomites area were defended by the Prato Piazza (Pl√§tzwiese) and Landro, which had been complemented with modern structures in the surrounding area (Col Rosson, Alpe di Specie, Col di Specie, Rautkofel). The forts of Haideck and Mitterberg (monte di Mezzo) in val di Sesto were intended to prevent any descent from the Monte Croce di Comelico pass towards Val Pusteria but they had not been modernised. To make up for this, Mount Dentro di Sesto was used as a fixed location for large calibre artillery. Forte Tre Sassi in 1916, half-destroyed by Italian artillery The pass between the Ampezzo basin and the Val Badia was controlled by Forte Tre Sassi on the stony ground of the Valparola Pass, while the Livinallongo del Col di Lana was blocked upstream of Pieve by :it:Forte Corte and :it:Forte Ruaz. Finally, near Moena stood :it:Forte Someda, guarding the Fassa Valley and the mouth of the San Pellegrino valley, a few kilometres from the front. All these forts were of modest size, much less impressive than the large fortresses on the Trentino highlands and in the Adige valley. At the beginning of the war they were partially decommissioned because they were outdated and inadequate to resist modern artillery. Their guns were moved to more favourable positions less detectable by the enemy; the buildings were highly visible and at times the Austrians continued to pretend that they were occupied in order to divert Italian fire towards useless targets. Both armies, from the beginning of the conflict, began the constant work of excavating caves, tunnels, trenches, walkways, shelters and underground depots, which led to the creation of entire underground towns relatively safe from enemy fire. Monte Piana and Col di Lana were notable examples of such structures, with impressive defensive systems. Other examples can be found at the Sass de Stria with its tunnels and trenches, and Lagazuoi, more excavated than any other mountain in the Dolomites; within it, a bloody battle was fought with mines. The Dolomites sector =Conca d'Ampezzo and Som Pouses= A couple of soldiers maneuver a cannon in the snow The war reached Cortina d'Ampezzo on July 31, 1914 with the conscription of men between 21 and 42 into the armed forces of Austria-Hungary. In November of the same year twenty-year-olds were also called up, and in May 1915, when Italy also entered the conflict, the draft was extended to men aged up to 50. Ladin speakers, Italian speakers from Trentino and German speakers from Tyrol were grouped into three regiments of Landessch√ºtzen and four of Kaiserj√§ger, hurriedly transferred to the Eastern Front. On the eve of the hostilities, General Nava, commander of the Italian 4th Army, ordered that the first objectives on the Cadore front were: taking of possession of the entire massif of Monte Piana and the Cortina d'Ampezzo basin, both in the operational area of the 1st Army Corps of General Ragni. In Cortina the gendarmes, the financial police, the few Standsch√ºtzen present and the elderly or veterans repatriated for illness or injuries, retreated behind Som Pouses to reinforce the defences that closed the Conca to the north. Although he had declared taking the Conca d'Ampezzo as his priority, General Nava, worried about strong resistance and ambushes from the woods, delayed in issuing orders, advising the commanders of the army corps to operate with great caution; so May 24 passed quietly. Only a few Italian exploratory patrols crossed the border, reaching Passo Tre Croci and the Cinque Torri without encountering the enemy, and only on 27 May did a patrol descend to Cortina, finding it completely free of defenders. The town was finally occupied on the 29th by two Italian columns. Cortina became the seat of the Italian command as well as of hospitals and a resting place for the troops returning from the fighting in the sector; the whole basin was frequently subjected to fire from Austrian artillery, but the bombardments were never particularly intense and scarcely affected the town of Cortina. To avoid further distress to the population however, in 1916 the Italian commanders moved away, and life in Cortina went on quietly until November 5, 1917, when the Austrians, following the rout of Caporetto, took possession of it once again. The last winter of the war also coincided with the hardest period for the civilian population, with the terrible food shortage that hit the Habsburg Empire, compelling the Austro-Hungarian troops to seize the few provisions the inhabitants had in occupied places. Pomagagnon Monte Cristallo Once Cortina was taken it was immediately clear that it could not be held securely without also taking the commanding heights above it - the Tofane to the north-west and Pomagagnon and Monte Cristallo to the northeast as well as the northern head of the basin itself - Val Travenanzes, Val Fanes and Val Acqua di Campocroce. Another objective strategic objective to be achieved was the occupation of the Alemagna road between Cortina and :it:Carbonin. Thus at the end of May 1915 Italian troops advanced the \\"line of investment\\": Col Drusci√®-Cadin-Staolin, a line from which the attack on the Som Pouses defense line would be attempted. The action planned by the Italian command anticipated attacking the Austrian defences with three assault columns, supported by field artillery and batteries of howitzers, 149mm guns and 210mm mortars placed on the hills surrounding Cortina. The first column on the western flank, with companies of Alpine troops, fought fiercely during the night of 8 and 9 June at Ponte Alto, which it occupied. From here it carried out various attacks against the Fanes barrage and towards the Val Travenanzes as it tried an enveloping maneuver around the Tofane group, in conjunction with other attacks on the Lagazuoi and against the Castelletto delle Tofane. The Italian offensive continued until June 16 with poor results; the Austro-Hungarians were well entrenched in Val Travenanzes and benefited from the terrain, so eventually the Italian command broke off the attacks. The central column, strong with two infantry battalions, aimed directly at the Som Pouses barrage, strongly fortified and with excellent defensive positions starting from the trench in the Acqua di Campo Croce valley up to the crest of the Ciadenes-I Zuoghi which encloses the Gotres valley. On 9 June a rapid enveloping action allowed the Italians to occupy Podestagno, a wooded cliff overlooking the Alemagna road. The Austrian defences could not be breached in this sector however and on the evening of 14 June the Italian command suspended any further attempt to advance. No less unfortunate was the eastern column, which on 7 June, bypassing the Pamagognon, descended along the Val Grande and reached the Alemagna road near the locality of Ospitale. From here, going up the Gotres valley, the attack proceeded as far as the end of the valley, at the Lerosa fork, along wide meadows where the Austrians were well entrenched. Divided into three assault groups, the Italians attacked on 9 June, but once they arrived on the wide plateau they were met with heavy fire from automatic weapons that cost large numbers and the loss of more than fifty prisoners, until the attack here was also suspended. This series of attacks did not obtain the desired objectives, but allowed the Italians to position themselves along a more advanced and more advantageous line that went from Ponte Alto to Rio Felizon, in the locality of Rufiedo. The Italian command failed to exploit the political advantage of capturing some Bavarian J√§gers at Ponte Alto, which unequivocally demonstrated the presence of German troops deployed offensively, despite the fact that Italy was not still at war with Germany. These attacks were followed by exactly one year of truce, and in June 1916 the Italians attempted a new assault, this time concentrated against the Croda dell'Ancona and the coston del Forame. Taking these positions would have allowed the Italians to descend into Val Felizon towards Carbonin and in Val Acqua di Campo Croce, from where they would have seriously threatened the Austrians‚Äô positions in the Conca d'Ampezzo. To prevent this, the Austrians further fortified their positions, and on 7 June they were ready to face the Italian troops who, began their attack up the Alemagna road. Despite the determination of the Italian soldiers, on the evening of June 22, after a last vain and bloody attempt at the Som Pouses, the order was given to suspend the attacks, which had cost the attackers 324 dead, 2826 wounded and 85 missing. After this attack the positions remained unchanged until the Italian retreat in the autumn of 1917. =Monte Piana= alt=Dolomites, Monte Piana, Italy (Unsplash).jpg The borders of 1866 had given the advantage of ground to the Austro-Hungarians almost everywhere, but on Monte Piana the border favored Italy. Except for the northern end, the plateau that formed the upper part of the mountain was in Italian hands, and formed a wedge between the Rienza and the Landro valleys, pointing towards Dobbiaco. Before the war the Austrians had tried to reduce the threat from this position by fortifying :it:Mount Rudo (Rautkofel) with several batteries that dominated the entire summit of Monte Piana. During the first days of the war small Italian patrols reconnoitred daily near the Austrian trenches, from where however they were chased back on 7 June 1915, the day the Austro-Hungarians started their first major action on the plateau. Goiginger gave orders for an attack carried out by two companies of Landessch√ºtzen and some units of Standsch√ºtzen. Coming up at night from Carbonin, they attacked and wiped out the Italian garrison at Piramide Carducci, roughly in the middle of the plateau, where the Austrians had initially been based. Advancing up to the Italian lines the Austrians were eventually forced to retreat by artillery and rifle fire, returning in the evening to the positions of Piramide Carducci and Forcella dei Castrati. Sporadic fighting and artillery fire continued until 11 June, when there was a lull for over a month, during which positions stabilized. the supply route on the north side on Monte Piana The Italians decided to wait for the arrival of additional artillery and built up overwhelming numerical superiority and it was not until July 15 that General Ottavio Ragni launched the attack on enemy positions. For five days there were attacks in three directions, which managed to drive the Austrians back off the southern plateau and conquer Forcella dei Castrati, but did not take the strategic northern edge of the mountain. On the last day of the attack, July 20, the Italians reported 104 dead, 578 wounded and 151 missing, most of whom had been blown to pieces by enemy artillery. Assaults and counterattacks followed until September, when both sides stopped to prepare for the first winter of the war. The winter was particularly hard for the Austrians in their precarious position, lacking water or fuel and supplied only by slow columns of porters ascending from Landro along a steep path targeted by Italian artillery. These months were mainly used to excavate covered trenches, tunnels and caves in the shelter of the northern edge; the paths on the western side were widened, and partly retraced in more sheltered positions, while at the end of November a cableway was erected that kept the Austrian-Hungarian line supplied for the next two years. Monte Piana trenches 1916 saw a progressive strengthening of positions, especially on the Austrian side, where the entire summit became a network of fortified defensive works. Soldiers led a mostly underground life in covered trenches, connecting tunnels and caves equipped for different functions. The Italians, with larger forces but weaker positions, continued their slow advance on the northern plateau. In August they managed to take the so-called \\"Fosso degli Alpini\\", a long depression on the eastern edge of the plateau, delimited by a grassy hill known to the Austrians as \\"Kuppe K\\". This position was important because it tied the Austrians down on another side of the mountain, and allowed the Italians to protect the ascent route along the Castrati valley, from which they could directly attack enemy lines. So at the end of August a short but fierce battle began for \\"Kuppe K\\", which was taken and lost several times, until the Italians managed to hold it. Throughout that winter and the spring of 1917 the war of attrition continued, with bombings, clashes between patrols, attempts to infiltrate enemy lines and the excavation of mine tunnels, by both sides. The last major attack was carried out by the Austro- Hungarians on 22 October - just two days before the breakthrough of Caporetto - to divert Italian attention from the movement of troops along the Val Pusteria. Modest initial conquests were soon halted by the Italian artillery, which drove the attackers back to their starting positions. This was the last important action on Monte Piana. =Monte Cristallo= Monte Cristallo The Cristallo Group lies between the Val Grande, the Misurina basin, the Val Popena and road from Rifugio Ospitale to :it:Carbonin. At its centre stand the peaks of Cristallo itself at 3221m and Piz Popena at 3152m. The Cristallo subgroup had been occupied by the Italians in the early days of the war. For their part the Austrians garrisoned the peaks that looked down towards the Ospitale - Carbonin road, the Forame at Forcella Verde and Forcella Gialla and the Costabella chain. The north-facing summit of the Rauhkofel/Cima Fumo was fortified and a line of trenches stretched from the slopes below it across the Val Popena, connecting it with Monte Piana. In early August 1915 the Italians began attacking the Austrian positions in the heights. Between 9 and 11 August Alpini units, strongly opposed by artillery and machine gun fire, began the assault on Forame and managed to take it on the night of 13th. Another column took the high peak of Cristallo, forcing the Austrians back to Cresta del Costabella and Rauchkofel. After bringing artillery up onto the peak the Italians began to bombard these positions on 26 August. This was followed by another attack in from 11-26 September, but hampered by fog, snow and freezing temperatures, the Italians could not force the Austrians off the mountain once and for all, and little ground changed hands. Another costly Italian attack between 20 and 26 October saw a group of volunteers try to outmanoeuvre the Austrians by climbing over the glacier in camouflage, but they were detected and repulsed after several days of determined fighting. In most sectors there were no major engagements after October each year at the latest, as the troops concentrated in preparing themselves to survive the winter. Unusually the IVth Army Command decided that the firm settled snow and the clear air of November favoured an infantry advance and the use of artillery. Having failed to take the high ground of Forame they decided to try a surprise attack immediately to the west, down the Val Felizon. When the attack began on 26 November it was plain that the Austrians had been expecting it, and they cut down the advancing soldiers with machine gun fire as they struggled through snow 70cm deep. By the evening when it was evident the attack had failed the brigade command requested permission to withdraw, but the 2nd Division command refused and at 20:45 ordered the action resumed the following morning. At dawn on 27 November, after an hour of artillery barrage to prepare for this assault, the XXXXVIII Bersaglieri should have resumed action. However the temperature was -20¬∞ and many of the soldiers had died of cold, with the survivors unable to advance. Nothing moved until at 14:30 Division ordered the action to stop. In two days the Italians had 897 casualties. Among the Bersaglieri 2 officers had died in action while five froze to death; among the men 29 had died in action, 111 were wounded, 20 missing and 318 had frozen to death. This was the last action of 1915 in this sector. In the summer of 1916 the Italians mounted fresh attacks on the Austrian positions on the Forame heights to the west of Rauhkofel. The plan was for a group of volunteers to work their way behind Austrian lines at night and attack at dawn, when the main Italian forces would advance out of their trenches. Early in the morning of 29 August this plan was executed. Surprised, the Austrians retreated leaving the Italians in control on the first ridge of the Forame, before progress halted. Between 4 and 6 September the Italians tried to push their way down the valley between Forame and Costa Bella, but constant Austrian fire stopped them advancing. Then, in a surprise counterattack in 13 September, the Austrians retook the peak of Forame, and quickly hosted up artillery and mortars to ensure they could not be removed again. =Croda Rossa di Sesto= Archaeologist studying the remains of WW1 positions on the Croda Rossa At the eastern edge of the 4th Italian Army sector, the Croda Rossa di Sesto was occupied by Austro-Hungarian troops on the Sesto side. From here they could control the pass of Monte Croce di Comelico, Cima Undici, the Zsigmondy crest and :it:Monte Popera. The Austrians had one of the best guides in the area, :de:Sepp Innerkofler, and, from July, support from the German Alpenkorps who hoisted two mountain guns onto the northern slope of the summit, to strike at a possible Italian advance from the Monte Croce pass. Nevertheless the early months of the war were calm, mainly because snow made the peaks above 3,000m impassible. On 7 July Italian artillery destroyed the Zsigmondy refuge, and in August Italian troops occupied the upper Fiscalina valley, pushing up to the Zsigmondy ridge. Despite enormous difficulties they succeeded in taking the 3,042m summit of Monte Popera. Their attention then shifted towards the Sentinella Pass. In August and September 1915 the Italians mounted a number of probing attacks at the Sentinella Pass, but autumn weather brought fighting to a standstill, with both sides leaving only small garrisons in position. It was the Italians who took the initiative in February 1916 with a new plan of attack which required Cima Undici to be occupied. The men chosen for the assault were the expert alpine troops of the \\"Cadore\\" and \\"Fenestrelle\\" battalions. On January 30 left they set off from the Zsigmondy ridge. Moving only at night or in bad weather over extreme terrain they advanced slowly through the heavy snowfalls and frequent avalanches of February and March. With the arrival of good weather, they had had reached two narrow ravines called \\"Da Col\\" and \\"Dal Canton\\", from where they could attack the Sentinella pass. On the night of 15 and 16 March thirty-six men led by three officers attacked the pass. Achieving complete surprise, they encountered no resistance. alt=Croda Rossa - Rotwand - Dolomiten.jpg However taking the Sentinella Pass would not give the Italians any advantage as long as the Austrians controlled the Croda Rossa. The Austrians began reinforcing their positions, under continuous fire from the Italian artillery in the Sentinella valley and on the Dito plateau. The Austro-Hungarian garrison increased from 20 to 150 men, and the whole summit was made impregnable. From June 16, the day of the last and failed Italian assault on the Croda, positions remained unchanged until November 1917, and the battle for the Croda Rossa turned into a daily routine of reconnaissance, with occasional small clashes. The harsh winter brought death to many in both sides on this section of the front, from avalanches, hunger, cold and disease. With the front lines unchanging after March 1916 the only significant action was from the giant 280mm and 305mm Italian howitzers positioned around the Misurina basin and on the Comelico side of the Monte Croce Pass. Their shots were guided by observers on the top of the Cristallino di Misurina, on the Popera and on the flanks of Cima Undici from where the view extended to Dobbiaco and San Candido. It was the towns of Moso and Sesto that suffered most from the Italian howitzers. Moso was evacuated by the Austrians and almost completely destroyed by the Italians to prevent the enemy from using it to store supplies. Sesto was not initially evacuated, leading to many civilian casualties as the Italians struck at lodgings, warehouses and telephone services. The bombardment of the villages to the rear of the Austrian lines continued until 1917, when the artillery was withdrawn following the breakthrough of Caporetto. = Tre cime di Lavaredo and Sasso di Sesto = alt=3 Cime Lavaredo Drone Shot.jpg alt=Paternkofel Abend.JPG Fighting in the Lavaredo area was less intense and of less strategic importance than on other parts of the front. However because of the popularity of the Tre Cime and surrounding areas with climbers and skiers meant that attend in events there was very great. Added to this, the death of the famous guide Sepp Innerkofler, who had accompanied clients from all over Europe, added greatly to the interest. Fighting started on the morning of May 24, 1915, with Italian cannon in Torre degli Scarpieri and Monte Rudo firing towards Monte Piana, to which the Austrians responded by hitting the Italian positions of Forcella Lavaredo and Forcella Col di Mezzo. Here shrapnel struck two Alpini of the 67th Company and caused the first death on the Dolomite front. Over the following days there were clashes between patrols and small groups of soldiers trying to climb up and occupy small portions of rocky ground, but perhaps the most famous action was the Austrian offensive on July 4, 1915 where Innerkofler lost his life. Together with some Standsch√ºtzen he attempted to occupy the Passaporto fork to cut off the Italian supplies for the Paterno. The assault failed but the Austrian commander Goiginger decided to attempt other strikes in the Tre Cime area on the evening of the same day. On the night of July 5 a group of Standsch√ºtzen attacked the Mezzo Pass, but was repulsed by two groups of Alpine troops, while a dawn attack on the Arghena fork was repelled by an infantry unit, temporarily putting an end to the Austro-Hungarian initiatives in the Lavaredo sector. alt=TorreToblin6.JPG The most notable event of the war in Lavaredo was an inconclusive attack by the Italians when the command of the I Corps decided to force its way into the :it:Val Fiscalina and the Val Campo di Dentro. Six battalions of infantry were massed behind the Tre Cime with the support of two battalions of mountain guns. The attack began on 14 August with an advance towards the Toblin fork on three different routes: from the Col di Mezzo fork, the Lavaredo fork and the Pian di Cengia fork. The last column was the first to achieve success with the conquest of the Alpe dei Piani basin, while the other two columns struggled to advance, hampered by their artillery. After three days of fierce fighting the Italians managed to take the Toblin fork and the Sasso di Sesto, but not Torre Toblin, so the Austrians were still able to block the road towards the fork of San Candido and then towards the Val Pusteria. Later Italian attempts failed but the Italians managed to move the front about 12 kilometers, significantly improving their defensive line. The positions of the two sides were very close here: between the Sasso di Sesto and Torre di Toblin they were separated by just a few hundred meters and this contributed to making that small sector much disputed, although after 30 October, there was no further major action in the Lavaredo area. The winter of 1916-1917 was unusually hard, as early as late August, when snow fell it did not melt. By November some positions were effectively isolated by the weather, with cableways and men themselves often affected by avalanches. Both armies excavated an extensive maze of tunnels and shelters in the rock and ice to improve the safety of their soldiers. In early 1917 the Austrians began to work on an assault tunnel under the snow. Work lasted two months, and on 21 April sixty soldiers, emerged little more than two metres from the enemy lines, attacking the trenches with hand grenades. The defenders were taken completely by surprise and many prisoners were captured while they slept. Although the Austrians quickly captured the trenches, the Italians organised a counterattack from caves dug into the rock. At dawn, the Italian artillery began to strike the attackers, while two platoons were sent to reinforce the men hidden in the Sasso di Sesto tunnels. On the morning of April 22 the counterattack began and by the early afternoon the position was again in Italian hands. With this episode, major fighting in the shadow of the Tre Cime also ended. =Falzarego Pass= alt=DC-1915-30-v.jpg The slowness of the Italian advance to secure Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo allowed the Wustruans to fortify and effectively seal off the routes to the north towards the Puster Valley. Unable to make George‚Äôs here the Italians turned their attention westwards to the Falzarego Pass between the Sass de Stria and the Cinque Torri. If they could take this and then gain control of the Col di Lana, they could dominate the eastern Tyrolean highlands and prepare to attack up the Val Badia towards Bruneck. On the 15th of June, furious fighting took place for the 2,477m spike-like Sasso di Strai which had been fortified by the Austrians. The Italian attack was disorganised and easily repelled, and fir the next two years small pieces of ground around the Pass were won and lost by both sides without either gaining any clear advantage. The Italians decided to focus on dislodging the Austrians from various Hugh points around the eastern entrance to the Pass, particularly the rocky outcrop called the Casteletto on the Tofana di Rozes. The fighting to secure thus became so intense that the Austrians called it the ‚ÄúSchreckenstein‚Äù - ‚ÄúThe rock of horror. Unable to push the Austrians off the Casteletto, in 1916 the Italians decided to dig a 500m gallery from their positions to the foot of the outcrop and use 35 tons of gelignite to destroy it. The Austrians responded by countermining but the Italians were so confident of success that General Cadorna and King Victor Emmanuel were invited to observe the detonation of the mine followed by the rapid assault by Italian troops held ready in another tunnel to swarm out after the explosion. The attack on 11 July was only partially successful. Many Italian soldiers were killed by carbon monoxide from the explosion as they rushed downhill, while others were killed by falling rocks. They managed to take the south side of the Casteletto but did not manage to drive the Austrians off completely for another three months. Taking the Casteletto turned out not to give the Italians a decisive advantage and they still could not force their way through the Falzarego Pass. Their next attempt was to reach the top of the Piccolo Lagazuoi, digging an over 1 km long tunnel system with a vertical drop of 500m. This also failed, but on 20th June 1917 the Italians succeeded in using 32 tons of dynamite to blow up the 2668m high summit of Piccolo Lagazuoi. Despite heavy losses the Austrians were still able to hold the attackers off with machine gun fire. There was little movement in this sector following this until the general withdrawal after Caporetto. =Col di Lana= Marker for the Austrian positions on Col di Lana The Col di Lana is one of the least striking mountains in the Dolomites in its appearance, but its location meant it was hotly disputed by the two armies. The mountain dominated all road traffic moving between the Pordoi Pass and the Falzarego Pass, connecting Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo with Canazei and the tens to the west. It was protected to the west by :it:Forte La Corte and on the northern side, at the foot of Mount Lagazuoi, by Forte Tre Sassi. The first action took place on 8 June 1915 when Italian batteries on Monte Padon and Col Toront bombarded the La Corte and Tre Sassi forts as well as Austrian infantry positions. The attack was repeated a week later, and expanded to strike at Livinallongo del Col di Lana. If the assault had begun earlier the weak Austrian presence might have been easily dislodged, but between May and a June the Austrians had fortified the Costone di Salesei and the Costone di Agai, meaning that it would take a frontal attack on Col de Lana to push them out. On 15 June, some Italian patrols sent towards the enemy positions were easily neutralized, and this was followed by series of bloody frontal attacks that achieved nothing. The Italians launched ten further attacks against Col di Lana and five against the adjoining Mount Sief until General Rossi called a halt on 20 July to await reinforcements. Italian magazine cover celebrating the short-lived taking of the Col di Lana, 1915 Despite this pause in infantry attacks the Italian artillery continued to bombard the La Corte and Tre Sassi forts. By the beginning of August, Tre Sassi was practically a pile of rubble, and this prompted the Italians to renew their attacks on 2 August. They were repulsed again. Smaller attacks on the Costone di Salesei and the Costone di Agai were also broken up by Austrian artillery. A major new frontal assault was launched on 21 October, in which the Italians outnumbered the defenders ten to one. Trench by trench, at great cost, the Austrians were dislodged from their positions and on 7 November the infantrymen of the Calabria Brigade finally conquered the summit. However it fell back into Austrian hands on the same day thanks to the Landessch√ºtzen of Captain :it:Kostantin Valentini, and the Italians withdrew just below the summit, only 80 meters from the Austrian trenches. Throughout the winter the Austrians dug an intricate system of covered tunnels and walkways that protected the soldiers from Italian artillery. On 1 January, the Austrians started the mine war with an explosion on the Lagazuoi, and, picking up the idea, in mud-January the Italians began work on a mine tunnel just below the summit. On April 17, 5020 kilograms of explosives devastated the summit of Col di Lana, killing 110 Austrians instantly, while the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner by the Calabria Brigade. While the Italians dug in and fortified Col di Lana the Austrians did likewise on Sief, each side making it effectively impossible for the other‚Äôs soldiers to attack across the intervening ground. Warfare therefore moved underground. The initiative was taken by the Austrians, who in June 1916 began work on a mine that was intended to destroy the Italian garrison on the Dente del Sief, which they had just conquered. The Italians realized this maneuver late and only in March 1917 did they begin a counter-mine tunnel. This however proved too short, and they destroyed part of their own lines and created a crater between the two armies. The Austrians proceeded with their work and on October 27, 45,000 kilograms of explosives tore the mountain to pieces, creating an 80-meter crater and killing 64 Italians. Shortly afterwards, after Caporetto, the Italians fell back to the line of the Piave and Monte Grappa, leaving the mountain in Austrian hands and thousands of bodies of fallen men. =Marmolada glacier= The co-called ‚ÄúBridge of Sighs‚Äù in the Austrian tunnels under the Marmolada glacier During the whole of 1915 neither of the two armies attempted to occupy the Marmolada massif that divided the fighters. Apart from some skirmishes between enemy patrols, who had pushed themselves up onto the Marmolada di Punta Penia at 3344m, the sector remained calm until the spring of 1916, when Austro-Hungarian units occupied a number of strongpoints facing the glacier. This move threatened the Italians on Col di Lana, so they occupied the eastern part of the Piz Serauta, fortifying themselves and installing a cableway. From then on, both sides worked intensively to reinforce their positions and protect themselves from the elements and enemy artillery. The Austrians established their central supply point under the tongue of the glacier on the Gran Poz at 2300 meters, at the uppermost point of the cableway, and from there porters took supplies to the positions at \\"Forcella della Marmolada\\" , \\"3259\\", \\"Twelve\\", \\"Eleven\\", \\"2800\\" and \\"slot S\\". Using ecrasite first, and then brute strength, they dug numerous tunnels inside the glacier to shelter from the Italian artillery firing down on them. The works continued throughout the winter of 1916 until the construction of what was called \\"the city under the ice\\" was complete. This was a network of barracks, kitchens, field hospitals, storerooms and gun emplacements under the ice connected by 12km of tunnels. alt=Marmolata, Gesch√ºtz in Eiskaverne in der \\"32er\\" Stellung. (BildID 15428376).jpg The conflict proceeded as a work of mining and countermining through rock and ice. The Austrians managed to create a large enough hole for, which they could direct artillery fire towards the Italians. Eventually, using drilling machines, the Italians succeeded in digging a countermine which they blew up, removing the threat But the Italians, after learning that they were under fire, accelerated the countermining work, and thanks to the help of drilling machines in a short time they managed to reach under the enemy positions, which were blown up in several points, eliminating the danger of artillery attack. The Italians could bring much greater numbers and more regular supplies to the Marmolada, so the Austrians were on the defensive, digging more and more shelters in the ice and rock in order to hold their positions. Other than mining and countermining, and artillery and grenade attacks there was no movement on this front until the Italians abandoned their positions after Caporetto. The Adamello- Presanella sector Alpini machine-gunners in the corno di Cavento, facing Adamello. alt=Avstro-ogrske ƒçete odbijajo na ledeniku Presanella napad alpinov.jpg The first action in this sector was a surprise Italian attack on 9 June 1915 by the \\"\\"Morbegno battalion\\" on the Presena glacier at the north end of the Adamello: however they were detected and forced back by sniper fire. On 5 July the Austrians responded with a surprise attack on the Italian garrison of Lago di Campo at the southern end. Despite heavy losses the Italians The managed to repel the attack, forcing their opponents to retreat to their starting positions. On July 15 the Austrians pressed a new attack on the Giuseppe Garibaldi refuge but the defenders managed, once again, to resist. On 25 August the Italians renewed their attack in the north; this time the Alpini attacked the creste di Monticelli at night and surprised the Austrians; once they had the ridge, fortification works began immediately. However further Italian attacks on the Presena glacier on 14 September and on 30 October failed before winter set in and fighting became impossible. The following spring hostilities resumed on 12 April, when the Alpini at the Giuseppe Garibaldi refuge successfully attacked the Austrian defensive line between Lobbia Alta and Monte Fumo. A further attack was launched between 29 and 30 April, towards the Cavento Pass. For the first time in this area, heavy artillery was used to support the infantry. Despite the lack of winter camouflage that forced them to fight in grey-green uniforms, the Italians managed to take the Austrian positions on the crozzon del Diavolo between 1 and 4 May. After this the front more or less came to a standstill. To bring light supplies such as food and wine up to their front lines, the Italians changed from using mules to using dogs, as they were faster and needed less food. The front remained calm through most of 1917. The main operation was the Italian seizure of the :it:Corno di Cavento in 15 June 15. On 27 September Austria attacked the town of Ponte di Legno with incendiary bombs and shells, destroying it and forcing its inhabitants to flee. Because this sector was at the western limits of the front, Italian troops were not withdrawn after the defeat at Caporetto as they were in the Dolomites and elsewhere, and fighting continued into 1918. The main operation of the year in this sector, known as the \\"White Battle\\", took place between 25 and 28 May. Seven battalions of Italian troops together with Arditi, machine gunners and around 200 pieces of artillery attacked and took the Presena glacier and nearby peaks. On 13 June the Austrians launched a last attack to try to break the Italian lines. They threw all their remaining forces into the ‚ÄùAvalanche offensive‚Äù in the hope of trying to create a Caporetto-style breakthrough in the Alps. Without German support however they made no headway and the attack foundered in its first day. Italian units attack an Austrian squad on the top of alt=DC-1915-35-v.jpg Exactly one year after losing the Corno di Cavento, on June 15, the Austro- Hungarians managed to regain it by digging a tunnel in the glacier, but the Italians were able to eject them again on July 19 and hold it thereafter. In another attack on 13 August the Alpini managed to regain the Torrione d'Albiolo, lost at the beginning of the war in 1915. On 1 November 1918 the final Italian attack came, this time on the Tonale Pass. The Austrians were no longer able to resist. Whole units surrendered and the Italian army was able to advance rapidly into the entire Val di Sole and on to Trento. This brought the war in Adamello to an end.  The Ortles-Cevedale sector Austrian soldiers in their trenches on Piz da las Trais Linguas in the Ortles-Cevedale sector. The Ortles-Cevedale peaks, on average 500m higher than those in the other two sectors, offered the most extreme conditions of all the Alpine battlefields. The ground here was also unusually hard, making the building of trenches and tunnels extremely difficult. These conditions made it almost impossible for either side to mount a decisive attack in the other, so the front was relatively static here. The major conflict here was the Battle of San Matteo, which took place in August 1918 on Punta San Matteo (3,678 meters). This was the highest altitude fighting seen anywhere in the First World War. Prisoners of war alt=Chiesetta alpina.JPG The effort of maintaining a solid front line in such extreme conditions was enormous and required enormous reserves of labour. For this reason, the Austrian command compelled the local inhabitants of the valleys behind the front line -including women and children - to work for them. As these were not sufficient, the Austrians also drafted in prisoners of war captured on the eastern front, although the Hague Convention of 1907 prohibited this. These men were made to do the hardest and riskiest jobs, such as the construction of cableways and trails. They were also used away from the front line, in the valleys doing agricultural work, taking the place of those who had had to leave for the front. In 1915 there were around 27,000 prisoners in the Tyrol, but after thus the count of both the living and the dead was soon lost. These men tried to escape every day, sometimes proving intelligence to the Italian Alpini who were only a few hundred metres away. At the Car√® Alto refuge in Adamello, Russian prisoners built an Orthodox church which still stands today.

The family later lived in a five bedroom house at Egmont Corner. Although her preference was art, she attended Regent Street Polytechnic to study photography, in accordance with his wishes. He died in 1930, and she took over the business. She continued to paint, attending Sutton and Cheam School of Arts part-time, and enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art as a full-time student in 1936. The same year she had three miniatures accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy and six for a Society of Miniaturists exhibition. Her work was also exhibited in her first London show at a gallery on Bond Street, at the Paris Salon and at the Royal Scottish Academy. Her portrait sitters in this period included the animal rights activist Nina Douglas-Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton, and the actress Gladys Cooper. She also photographed theatre people, to fund her time at college. One of her her photographs of George Bernard Shaw forms the frontispiece in G.B.S. - A Full-length Portrait by Hesketh Pearson.

She was called up to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, with the rank of as an Aircraftwoman Motor Transport Driver. After training, she was allocated to Fighter Command at RAF Biggin Hill. During periods of inaction, she would draw or paint her colleagues, usually at work or resting in informal poses. Her works in this period used mostly watercolour, but also variously involved pencil drawing, pen or brush and ink, or oil on board and canvas. The RAF Museum calls them \\"an unrivalled record of daily life on RAF stations\\". She exhibited a selection at the National Portrait Gallery in 1943, where she was photographed discussing her work with Queen Elizabeth. In December 1944, she was attached to No. 6091 Servicing Echelon at RAF Manston, providing ground support for the Spitfires of No. 91 Squadron. The following October she moved to Headquarters No. 28 Group in London, when she chose to extended her service to begin work as an Educational and Vocational Training Instructor, helping men to return to civilian life. She was discharged on 28 May 1946, with the rank of Sergeant.  Return to civilian life  Blacker moved back to the family home in Sutton, and decided to pursue painting as a career. She became acquainted with Dame Lillian Bayliss and used her contacts to paint people from the world of theatre (for example, John Reynolds Ruddock), and to recruit Graham Sutherland as President of the Sutton Arts Network, with which she was involved. She began to travel, and in 1956 spent attended a Soroptimist International conference in New York, then spent three months in the United State sand Canada, earning her keep by painting portraits of people's pets. In 1957 she attended a conference on vegetarianism, in India (she had earlier attended the International Vegetarian Union's eleventh World Vegetarian Congress, at Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire, in 1947, and sketched the attendees). She then undertook a year-long tour of South-East Asia. Percy Bernard, 5th Earl of Bandon, who was Air Staff Officer, South East Asia Command, sat for a portrait that is now in the RAF Museum. In Kuala Lumpur, one of her paintings was purchased by Raja Permaisuri Agong, Tunku Puan Besar Kurshiah. Around 1960, she returned to India to undertake further portrait commissions, including for Colonel Sir Budah Singh.  Death and legacy  Blacker continued to paint until, in her sixties, failing eyesight forced her to stop. She died on 10 April 1984, at Sutton Hospital. Her works are in a number of public collections, including over 100 in the RAF Museum, and a portrait of Alderman William Tuckett Venton, Mayor of Sutton and Cheam, owned by the London Borough of Sutton. A painting in Hereford County Hospital is also attributed to her. Her painting Altar at St George‚Äôs Chapel, of the chapel at Biggin Hill, survived the destruction of that chapel by fire, as she had borrowed it for an exhibition. Once the rebuilt chapel, now the Biggin Hill Memorial Museum, was completed, she returned it there. An exhibition of her work was held by the RAF Museum in 2001 and 2002, first at their RAF Cosford base, then at their museum at Hendon. In April 2017, Whitehall Historic House, a museum in Cheam, Surrey, declared her their \\"Object of the Month\\". In September 2020, a number of works, still in the possession of her family were shown on a special edition of the BBC Television programme Antiques Roadshow, to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, by her great-niece. General Sir Jeremy Blacker was her nephew.

It ran from Schirmeck in the Alsatian speaking Alsace to Allarmont, Colas and Moussey in the Frech speaking Vosges.Colas (French Vosges). Published by W. Springer's Sons, Strasbourg in Alsace, approved by the Office of the Deputy General in Berlin, Department III b, in or before 1916.  History  The Donon Light Railway was built by the Germans as a so-called \\"forest railway\\" at a time when Alsace belonged to the German Reich according to the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871). It was officially intended for logging, but had also a military and strategic significance from the very beginning, as it could quickly be used as a military railway in case the French wanted to recapture the area.Infrastructure ferroviaire de France ‚Äì reseaux speciaux. In 1886 forester Bierau, a forestry engineer stationed in Rothau, laid a network of forest railways in the state forests. Unloaded wagons were pulled up into the forest by horses, and after being loaded they rolled downhill by gravity. In 1892 an unusually violent storm devastated the forests of the Vosges, and hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of timber had to be transported to the sawmills. To minimise the transportation effort and cost, the German forestry administration procured two 0-6-0 Krauss locomotives, each with a power of 50 hp, as suggested by forester Bierau.Jean- Georges Trouillet: Les chemins de fer forestiers.Article by Claude J√©r√¥me, published in L'Essor, a journal issed by the Society of History and Archeology of Schirmeck.  Track construction  The originally long horse-drawn tram was made of rails with a weight of 12.5 kg/m (25 lbs/yd) and a height of on unimpregnated fir wood sleepers. It was lengthened after the storm of 1892. It then had of fixed track weighing 16 kg/m (32 lbs/yd) on oak sleepers and of portable track. The unusual track gauge of 700 mm was chosen, among other things, so that the French could not use the tracks with their Decauville and P√©chot-Bourdon locomotives, which had a gauge of 600 mm, in the event of a military attack. Forest railway track system of the forester Bierau from Schirmeck Instead of the rail frames of the Decauville Railways, which were common in France, Bierau used a system of tie rods developed by him. These were beneficial especially in curves and on steep gradients, as the track gauge could be adjusted slightly wider than on the straight sections of the line. He used a system without sleepers, where the rails were laid directly on the forest floor and only connected by strong tie rods. So-called angle brackets were used, which pressed themselves into the ground or had to be buried in it. The rails were as long as possible in straight sections to minimise the number of rail joints, but in curves shorter rails were preferred.Hermann Stoetzer: Waldwegebaukunde nebst Darstellung der Waldeisenbahnen: Ein Handbuch f√ºr Praktiker und Leitfaden f√ºr den Unterricht.

Biography  Graundfote (whose surname was alternatively written as Gramfree) was born in 1420, presumably as the son of Richard Graunford of Broadwater, Sussex, a gentleman who was pardoned for an offence in the Pardon Roll of 1446. Graundfote's names, in the assessment of Josiah Wedgwood \\"show close association with the other side of the channel; thought it remains doubtful whether the surname comes from a Franch Grandfort or from an out-size in shoes\\".Josiah Wedgwood, The History of Parliament, Biographies of the Members of the Commons House, 1439‚Äì1509, p.388, His Majesty's Stationery Office, (1936) Graundfote was first mentioned as coming before the Gestling Hundred Court in 1447 at Icklesham in Sussex, as a plaintiff in a case against Alice Taillour and Jane Danyell, where it was alleged that Taillour, \\"a common scolde\\" has made use of \\"sorserie\\" to cause bodily harm on Graundfote.Wedgwood, History, p.388, His Majesty's Stationery Office, (1936) The Court awarded the aggrieved party an amercement of 4d from Taillour and 12d from Danyell. Graundfote is recorded in 1449 as an elector in the county constituency of Sussex. His subsequent activities until his election to Parliament in 1459 can be ascertained from the Chamberlain's Accounts of Rye which recounts that Graundfote was paid 6s. 8d. for the hire of two horses to go to London in 1450, before later appearing on the list of Jurats for the year 1456/7, and being noted as having sold salt to the town of Rye at 3s. a load. In 1459, the year of his election to the Parliament of Devils, he was pardoned for an offence on the 20 January, noted as an \\"esq. of Winchelsea alias Rye\\". Despite this he was to serve as a King's bailiff of Rye from 1459 to 1461. In the year between 1459-60 he was paid for 40 days at Parliament with an extra 10s. 8d. \\"for riding up to London whence he was sent up to the King and the Lords, for the town, with excuse, what time it was not as it is now, blessed be God of the grace of amendment and so continue\\". From this in can be inferred that Graundfote was elected to the Parliament of the Devils convened at Coventry in the Benedictine Priory of St Mary's, which first met on the 20 November 1459. Furthermore, from this account it can be inferred that his constituents wished that Graundfote had been kept at home after the invasion of the Earl of Warwick from Calais in 1460. Graundfote was elected to the Parliaments of 1460, 1461 and 1463, serving in the House of Commons until retiring in 1465 along with fellow Rye Member of Parliament John Hamond. During the eighty-year period from 1439‚Äì1509, Graundfote was recorded as being the only man of the 2,600 who served in the House of Commons to have the Christian name of Babylon.Wedgwood, History, p.xvii, His Majesty's Stationery Office, (1936) In July 1461 he was appointed with the Mayor of neighbouring Winchelsea to a commission on piracy. From 1466 until 1474 Graundfote would serve as a King's bailiff of Rye, as he had done so before between 1459‚Äì1461. Graundfote was appointed Mayor of Rye in 1463 a position he would hold for over a decade, succeeding John Hamond.Wedgwood, History, p.412, His Majesty's Stationery Office, (1936) In 1466 Graundfote and his son John were granted the office of bailiff of Rye, a position that came with the caveat of a lifetime appointment for the two men. Despite this he was charged as an accessory before the King's Bench in 1468, yet he would receive two pardons on the 28 January 1461 and again on 9 January 1472, when he was referred to as 'Babilo Graunfort of Rye, esq.'. Beginning from 1474 Graundfote would steadily retire from his various positions. That year he was recorded as handing over, sole, the bailivy of Rye to his son John, who by this point was a Yeoman of the Crown. On 28 August 1475 Graundfote retired as Mayor of Rye, yet his influence in local politics is seen when he was in attendance at the Cinque Ports meeting in New Romney as Master Graundfote. In 1475 he was recorded as having been a shipowner, and having in his possession several workshops in the market and the strand, for which he is noted as having paid a rent of 12d.. While no notice of death has survived, Wedgwood concluded that Graundfote died around the year 1480, at which time he would have been around sixty years of age.

Early life and education  Rodriguez-Villegas attended the University of Seville where she earned both her master's and doctoral degrees. Based on she was selected as the top student of the year, being awarded the San Alberto Magno Prize. Her doctoral research considered floating-gate MOSFETs. After graduating Rodriguez-Villegas was awarded a research grant from the Government of Spain and joined the Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona.  Research and career  In 2002 Rodriguez-Villegas joined Imperial College London, where she was eventually promoted to Professor of Low Power Electronics. Rodriguez-Villegas works on low-power circuitry for medical diagnostics. Her circuits are capable of the highly accurate monitoring of physiological signals, allowing researchers to model the processes behind disease. These models allow not only the monitoring of medical conditions but also offer diagnostic capabilities. She is most interested in brain and respiratory conditions. In 2010 she was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant to develop wearable technologies for the diagnosis and monitoring of epilepsy. In 2004 Rodriguez- Villegas was approached by the Epilepsy Society to create a low-power microelectronic device to monitor for sleep apnea. The society believed that her technology could prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Based on her work on sensitive monitoring of sleep apnea, Rodriguez-Villegas founded Acurable in 2016. Acurable have been supported by Innovate UK and Microsoft. Acurable created the AcuPebble sensor, which allows the accurate diagnosis and management of respiratory conditions through the monitoring of acoustic signals with astounding accuracy. The device can help patients manage conditions including apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whooping cough. It was successfully validated by the National Health Service in 2019 and achieved a CE mark in 2020. Alongside the AcuPebble, has worked on a wireless, lightweight (1.5g), low-power device (the TaiNi) that can monitor the brains of mice for three days. The ability to read information remotely reduces the amount of time that researchers have to handle mice, minimising the stress they experience, and the lightweight affords the mice greater freedom of movement. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rodriguez-Villegas worked with a team of volunteers to design a contact-tracing app. Unfortunately, Apple would only support one government-sponsored app per country, and Rodriguez-Villegas' was not continued.

She showed modest racing ability as a juvenile in 2019 when she won one minor race from five attempts. In the following year she made rapid progress, winning her first four races including the Corrib Fillies Stakes, Fairy Bridge Stakes and Matron Stakes. Background Champers Elysees is a bay filly with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Ireland by Karl Bowen. As a foal in November 2017 she was put up for auction at the Tattersalls Ireland Fairyhouse Foal and Breeding Stock Sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨12,500 by Aughamore Stud. In the following year she returned to the Tattersalls sales ring and was bought for ‚Ç¨28,000 by Johnny Murtagh. She was again offered for sale in early 2019 but failed to reach her reserve price. She entered the ownership of Fitzwilliam Racing and was trained during her racing career by Murtagh at Collaghknock Glebe, County Kildare. She was sired by Elzaam, an Australian-bred stallion who recorded his biggest win in the Listed Carnarvon Stakes in 2011. Champers Elysees' dam La Cuvee showed no racing ability, failing to win or place in seven starts, but was a daughter of the high-class sprinter Premier Cuvee who won the Goldene Peitsche in 1986. Premier Cuvee was a great-granddaughter of the French broodmare Vareta (foaled 1953) whose other descendants have included Ashkalani, Dick Turpin and Zalaiyka. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Champers Elysees was ridden by Conor Hoban when she made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 16 August 2019 when she started a 40/1 outsider and finished third of the twenty-nine runners. In a similar event on heavy ground at Roscommon Racecourse sixteen days later she ran second to Helvic Dream, beaten four and three quarter lengths by the winner. On 15 September at the Curragh she came home sixth behind Stone Circle in the Tattersalls Ireland Super Auction Sale Stakes. Two weeks later she started second favourite for a minor race over six furlongs at the Curragh in which she was ridden, as in her last two starts, by Shane Foley. Racing on heavy ground she was towards the rear of the field for most of the way before finishing strongly to win by three quarters of length from the colt Johan Zoffani. The filly ended her first season by finishing second to For The Trees in a handicap race for juveniles at Naas Racecourse on 20 October. =2020: three-year-old season= The 2020 flat racing season in Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Champers Elysees did not reappear until 12 June when she started at odds of 14/1 for a seven furlong maiden at the Curragh. Ridden by the apprentice jockey Danny Sheehy she took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and kept on well to win by half a length from Bright Idea. Ben Coen took the ride when the filly was stepped up in class to contest the Listed Corrib Fillies Stakes over seven furlongs at Galway Races on 28 July and went off the 15/8 favourite in a twelve-runner field. After tracking the leaders she went to the front on the final turn and drew away in the straight to win \\"easily\\" by seven lengths. On 2 September at Gowran Park Champers Elysees was moved up in grade again and started 5/6 favourite against ten opponents for the Group 3 Fairy Bridge Stakes. The race had been originally scheduled to be run a week earlier at Tipperary but the meeting was abandoned as the course was waterlogged. With the veteran Niall McCullagh in the saddle, she settled behind the leaders before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and winning by half a lengths from Pearls Galore. Johnny Murtagh commented \\"I was so sick last week when Tipperary was called off, but thankfully the race was rescheduled to here, and I thought the track would suit her well. She really improved from Galway, and had a better prep coming into this race... she's tough and hardy\\". Ten days after her win at Gowran Park Champers Elysees was moved to the highest class for the Group 1 Matron Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse in which she was ridden by Colin Keane and went off at odds of 9/2. Fancy Blue started favourite while the other contenders included Peaceful, Albigna, Know It All (Derrinstown Stud Fillies Stakes) and Valeria Messalina (Brownstown Stakes). Champers Elysees was restrained before beginning to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile. She overtook Peaceful inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths. After the race Murtagh said \\"It's been a brilliant year but to win a Group 1 on Champions Weekend, it means everything. That's what we get up in the morning for; we want to be here on this stage. Races like the Sun Chariot Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Mile will have to be considered for her now. I'm a very good trainer, I just need better horses\\".

In this one season that Messerli played for the club, he played a total of four games for Basel, scoring those two mentioned goals. Two of these games were in the Nationalliga A and two were friendly games. Following this season Messerli moved on to play for FC Aarau, then for Br√ºhl St. Gallen, both of whom played in the second tier of Swiss football. He then moved for one season to Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich and one season to FC Luzern in the top tier. In the summer of 1971 Messerli then transferred to FC Chiasso, who at that time played in the seond tier, and at the end of the season 1971‚Äì72 Messerli and his team won promotion from the Nationalliga B to the Nationalliga A He played for Chiasso for another two seasons before he moved to Nordstern Basel. During the winter break of the season 1975‚Äì76 he returned to Chiasso, where he ended his active playing career. References Sources * Die ersten 125 Jahre.

At the time of his departure, Longo left as the winningest coach in school history while leading them to their first appearance in the New Jersey state playoffs and an undefeated championship season. He accepted an assistant coaching position at William Paterson as the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator in 2000. He left in 2002 to be the associate head coach and offensive coordinator at LaSalle, and was named the head coach of the team in 2004. As head coach of LaSalle, he compiled a 7‚Äì14 record over two years before leaving to accept the offensive coordinator position at Minnesota‚ÄìDuluth. He joined the coaching staff at Southern Illinois in 2008 as the offensive coordinator. Longo joined the coaching staff at Youngstown State in 2010 as the wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator. Longo joined the coaching staff at Slippery Rock in 2011 as the wide receivers coach, where his wife Tanya worked as the head coach of the university's women's basketball team. He was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2012, and the team underwent a dramatic change in offense averaging 54.5 points a game. = Sam Houston State = Longo was added to the coaching staff at Sam Houston State in 2014.

Coaching philosophy  A practitioner of the air raid offense, Longo chose to adopt the offensive system after meeting then- Kentucky offensive coordinator Mike Leach at a coaching clinic in the late 1990s. Unlike the standard air raid offense that is pass-heavy, Longo's offense is designed so that it can be both pass or run oriented, and that it's not decided which it is until the game.

Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the nearby Colorado River, which here is Lake Powell six miles to the east of this mountain. History Holmes The American geologist Grove Karl Gilbert surveyed this area in 1875 and 1876, and published his findings in 1879 as a monograph, The Geology of the Henry Mountains. The term laccolith was first applied as laccolite by Gilbert after his study of intrusions of diorite in the Henry Mountains. Mount Holmes was named about 1878 by Grove Karl Gilbert who would become the chief geologist of the United States Geological Survey in 1889, for William Henry Holmes (1846‚Äì1933), who provided an illustration of the Grand Canyon which appeared in the 1879 Report on Lands of the Arid Region of The United States by John Wesley Powell.

Madey (October 24, 1937 ‚Äì July 27, 2008) was an American condensed matter physicist who specialized in the chemistry and physics of surfaces. He was a professor in the physics and chemistry departments at Rutgers University at the time of his death. Early life and Education Theodore Eugene Madey was born in Wilmington, DE, and was raised in Baltimore, MD. He was the descendant of Polish American immigrants who were amongst a wave of immigrants that fled instability and famine in Poland at the turn of the century. His grandparents and parents lived in Delaware‚Äôs New Castle County at the time of his birth, where his Polish-born grandfather worked for a shipbuilding company. At a young age, his family relocated to Baltimore, MD where he was raised, and attended Loyola Blakefield High School. He majored in physics at Loyola College, also in Baltimore, and completed a B.S. in 1959. In the summer following his graduation he was hired by one his college professors, a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, to work in a physics laboratory with vacuum materials. Madey went on to attend graduate school in physics at the University of Notre Dame and continued to work in the field of vacuum science. He completed his Ph.D. in physics in the experimental condensed matter group of Edward Coomes in 1963. Career Madey's first appointment after graduation was at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), as a National Research Council post-doctoral fellow. He was hired permanently, and remained there for 25 years, becoming the leader of the Surface Science and Kinetics group. While employed at NBS, he developed a close working relationship with John T. Yates, Jr., with whom he would go on to co-author more than 60 publications, and was jointly awarded the 1978 Samuel Wesley Stratton Award. In 1988, he relocated to New Jersey, where he was appointed as the State of New Jersey Professor of Surface Science at Rutgers University, and mentored dozens of students and post-doctoral research associates. He remained in this position until his death in 2008. While at Rutgers, he hosted one of his former post-doctoral research associates, Prof. Ulrike Diebold, and her research group into his own research laboratory when Diebold's group was forced to temporarily evacuate in 2005 from Tulane University in New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina.. Madey served on a number of scientific editorial boards, and also held a variety of elected and appointed leadership roles in the AVS., including President (2001). He was also extensively involved with international outreach and served as the President (1992-1995), and Secretary-General (1986-1989) of the International Union for Vacuum Science, Technique and Applications (IUVSTA). Research  Madey's research activities fell into three areas: *\\"Surface structure, electronic properties, and reactivity of bimetallic surfaces by atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, electron diffraction, and synchrotron radiation. *Mechanisms of electron - and photon-stimulated desorption of atoms and ions from surfaces (including charge transfer and energy transfer phenomena) using unique apparatus that permits angle-resolved ion detection. *Nucleation, growth, epitaxial structure and interfacial reactivity of ultrathin metal films on oxide surfaces and on polymer surfaces using electron and ion spectroscopies, coupled with high resolution (sub-nanometer) electron microscopy.\\" His technique using desorption of atoms induced by electronic transitions to study surfaces was known as (DIET). It involved striking a surface with photons or electrons so as to cause an adsorbate to transition into a repulsive excited state, which if long-lived enough would cause it to be ejected from the surface carrying a significant amount of energy. In the case of a dielectric sample such as a halide or oxide, the phenomenon is capable of causing the ejection of surface atoms, leading to electron- or photon beam damage in surface analytical methods such as Auger Electron Spectroscopy or Photoelectron Spectroscopy. It also provided an explanation for why the atmosphere of the Moon and of Mercury have atmospheres enriched in sodium and potassium because of their exposure to solar wind. In collaboration with John T. Yates, Jr., Madey studied abrasion of monumental brass in historical structures. Their work is credited with playing a significant role in allowing the rubbing of brass to continue as a cleaning method, by revealing a rubbing method for brass that cleaned without abrading or destroying it. Madey also co-authored, along with Patricia Thiel, a highly cited and comprehensive review article describing the interactions and properties of water near solid surfaces. A special issue of the Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter was published in 2010 to honor his memory. Honors and Awards Madey received numerous awards and honors for the quality and creativity of his work, including an honorary Doctorate Honoris Causa from the University of Wroclaw in Poland in 2004, in recognition of a decade-long collaboration with colleagues in Poland. Other honors include: * 1971 Fellow of the American Physical Society * 1978 Samuel Wesley Stratton Award, jointly with John T. Yates, \\"for an unusually significant research contribution to science or engineering that merits the acclaim of the scientific world and supports NIST‚Äôs mission objectives\\" * 1993 Fellow of the American Vacuum Society * 1985 Medard W. Welch Award,\\"For his investigations of surface processes at a fundamental atomic and molecular level, especially the determination of absorbed molecule bonding geometries.\\" * 2003 Inducted into the NIST Gallery of Distinguished Scientists Two years after Madey‚Äôs death in 2008, the Theodore E. Madey Award was established by AVS to commemorate both his research and his leadership in international interactions of the AVS. The Award recipient is sponsored to visit Poland, present a seminar at the University, and engage in scientific discussions. Personal Life Madey was born on October 24, 1937 in Wilmington, Delaware. He met his wife, Jane Mary Madey (Gunn), while he was in college by gaining access to a cast party following her performance at a nearby college. They were married for 48 years, until his death on July 27, 2008 in Somerset, New Jersey. They had four children, Timothy Madey, Doretta Witt, Maureen O'Shea, and Daniel Madey, the first of whom was born while Madey was in graduate school at the University of Notre Dame.

It is within the larger neighborhood of Venice on the westside of Los Angeles. The area is noted as an \\"important example of African-American life in Southern California during the early 20th century\\". The neighborhood has alternately been referred to as \\"Ghost Town\\" , \\"Dogtown\\" and the \\"Oakwood Pentagon\\". It contains one Los Angeles Cultural Historic Monument. Geography Oakwood is bounded by Dewey Street to the northwest, Lincoln Boulevard to the northeast, California Avenue to the southeast, Electric Avenue to the southwest, and Hampton Drive to the west. History It is uncertain if racially restrictive housing covenants were in place in Venice at the beginning of the 20th Century (though were in place in Santa Monica, located to the north). However, de facto segregation in hiring practices and real estate sales led to the development of Oakwood as a predominantly African-American neighborhood. Between 1910 and 1920, the population of African-Americans in Venice tripled as blacks arrived to work as manual laborers, service workers, and servants to wealthy white residents. The earliest black residents of Oakwood were hired as employees of Abbot Kinney; among these were cousins Arthur Reese and Irvin Tabor. Reese, an artist and sculptor, was hired by Abbot Kinney as the town decorator. (He is best known for decorating parade floats simulating Mardi Gras.) Tabor was hired as Abbot Kinney‚Äôs chauffeur, and the two men forged a bond . When Kinney died, he willed his house to Tabor. However, due to racist sentiments elsewhere in Venice, in 1922 Tabor relocated 2 structures from Kinney's St. Marks Island to their present-day location in Oakwood . Both the Reese and Tabor residences remain in Oakwood today. A second phase of migration from the Southern states occurred during World War II. The population of blacks in Oakwood tripled between 1940 and 1950 due to the need for defense workers at nearby manufacturing facilities (Hughes Aircraft in Culver City and McDonnell Douglass in Santa Monica). By the end of the 20th century, gentrification had altered Oakwood. Homes were fetching sometimes more than $1 million, and longtime residents were being displaced. Others were leaving voluntarily; The head of the Venice Stakeholders Association stated that ‚ÄúA large population of black Americans who may have owned from Abbot Kinney‚Äôs time voluntarily took their equity and left\\", cashing in on soaring property values. In 2007, Xinachtli, a Latino student group from Venice High School and subset of MEChA, referred to Oakwood as one of the last beachside communities of color in California. In 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that the breakneck pace of change along on Rose Avenue ‚Äî at the northern end of Oakwood ‚Äî suggested that the down-and-out bohemian days of this \\"countercultural beach neighborhood\\" were numbered. The wine shops, cafes, restaurants would eventually lead to the other streets of Venice being transformed into upmarket areas. ‚ÄúThe tipping point has been tipped‚Äù said former Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. In 2017, the Irvin Tabor Residence was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. In 2018, community residents tried to prevent a former African-American church from being converted into a mansion by having it named a Historic-Cultural Monument. Jay Penske planned to convert the church into an 11,000 square foot mansion. However, the Venice Neighborhood Council voiced approval for the project. On December 18, 2018, the Los Angeles City Council voted to not declare the property a historic cultural monument, citing that all the stained glass and the pews and most of the historic fabric on the interior of the church had already been removed. Demographics In 1950, African-Americans made up 12.6% of the Oakwood population. By 1970, that number had grown to 44.9%. By 1980, that number had dropped to 29.9%. By 2000, the African-American population was down to 16% , Latinos made up 48% of Oakwood and whites made up 33%. By 2009, whites had become the largest racial-ethnic group in Oakwood, with Latinos at 33% and African-Americans at 16%. According to the Los Angeles Times, in 2000, about half the people living in the two census tracts along Rose Avenue were Latino, and a third white. But by 2010, the proportions had flipped, with whites making up nearly half of all residents in those tracts.

Myrddin, the legendary 6th- century North British bard and warrior, is depicted as being encouraged by his sister Gwenddydd to utter a series of prophecies detailing the future history of the kings of Gwynedd, leading up to an apocalyptic ending. The mood of the poem has been described as \\"one of despair and of loss of faith and trust in this world\\".  Synopsis  The poem concerns the 6th-century figures Myrddin and Gwenddydd, who are presented as brother and sister with a friendly and harmonious relationship. Reference is made to the death of Gwenddolau at the battle of Arfderydd and Myrddin's consequent descent into madness, and to the 6th-century kings Rhydderch Hael, Morgant Fawr, and Urien Rheged, but otherwise the poem largely consists of prophecies of the far future spoken by Myrddin in response to questions by Gwenddydd. These prophecies begin by tracing the line of descent from Maelgwn Gwynedd down to the 10th-century king Hywel Dda and beyond. Then follows a series of stanzas whose meaning is obscure, though there may be references to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth and to Henry II and his sons. There is a messianic passage in which Owain, Beli, Cadwaladr and Cyndaf return in triumph, then a last deluge and the end of all kingship. Myrddin predicts his own death, and he and his sister commend each other to God.  Manuscripts  Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd ei Chwaer survives in two manuscripts: the Red Book of Hergest (Oxford, Jesus College, MS 111), which dates from the last quarter of the 14th century or the first quarter of the 15th; and Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 20, which dates from the first half of the 14th century.  Date  There is very wide disagreement as to the poem's date. A. O. H. Jarman took the view that its core could have been composed as early as the 9th or 10th century, but that it had been added to later. Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson, followed by Rachel Bromwich, dated it on linguistic grounds to the 10th or 11th century. Oliver Padel cast doubt on the linguistic evidence for an early date and suggested that it could have been written about the middle of the 12th century or a little later. John Bollard rejected the theory that the poem had grown by accretion and instead assigned it to the 13th century, while acknowledging that it made use of much older traditions.  Analogues  The poem stands in a tradition of medieval Welsh works about a wild man in north Britain, but the precise relationship between these works is contested. Among several prophetic poems associated with the name of Myrddin, two, Yr Oianau and Y Bedwenni have at points verbal similarities to the Cyfoesi. Other Myrddin poems also resemble the Cyfoesi in making repeated reference to Myrddin's fall into madness and to Gwenddolau's death at Arfderydd. The figure of Myrddin may be identical with a madman called Lailoken who appears in Jocelyn of Furness's Life of St Kentigern. In what could be a direct reference to the Lailoken legend, Gwenddydd several times refers to Myrddin in the Cyfoesi as llallawc, though this word may simply be Middle Welsh for \\"lord\\" or \\"friend\\". The general situation described in the Cyfoesi, in which Gwenddydd elicits prophecies of future kings from her brother, closely resembles several passages in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Vita Merlini, and there are also parallels with the early Irish poems Baile in Sc√°il and Baile Chuind.  Legacy  The writer John Cowper Powys used the Gwenddydd of Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd as the basis of his Gwendydd, sister of Myrddin, in his Porius (1951), a historical novel set in the year 499. She has been described as \\"one of the most memorable minor characters\\". The American academic Jerry Hunter's Welsh- language novel Gwenddydd [cy] (2010) takes the story of Gwenddydd and Myrddin from the Vita Merlini, Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd, and other early Myrddin poems, and transposes it to the Second World War, Myrddin becoming a soldier suffering from PTSD who escapes from a military hospital and reunites with his sister Gwen in the family's home village. It won the at the 2010 National Eisteddfod of Wales, and has been called \\"an important contribution to war literature in Wales\\".

Banister was born in October 1918 at Llandygai, Caernarfonshire. His father was an officer in the Indian Civil Service, with Banister spending his early years living in British India at Bombay. He later returned to the United Kingdom when his father took up a post as a research scientist at the University of Cambridge. He was educated at King's College Choir School, before attending Eton College. From Eton he went up to King's College, Cambridge where he studied classics. While studying at Cambridge, he played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1938‚Äì39, making six appearances. Playing as a right-arm off break bowler, he took 5 wickets at an expensive bowling average of 70.00 and with best figures of 2 for 73. Banister was rejected for service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, but was recruited shortly after to Bletchley Park, where he worked a codebreaker in Hut 6. After the war he joined the Civil Service, where he became under-secretary for the Department for Transport.

Dusina was nominated inquisitor of Malta by Pope Gregory XIII on 3 July 1574, and he arrived on the island on 1 August of the same year. Prior to Dusina's appontment, the Bishop of Malta had held inquisitorial authority, but disputes between Grand Master Jean de la Cassi√®re and Bishop Mart√≠n Royas de Portalrubio led to the Pope's nomination of Dusina as inquisitor. On 28 January 1575, the Pope confirmed Dusina's role as apostolic visitor to Malta. La Cassi√®re offered Dusina the former Castellania in Birgu to house his official residence as well as the tribunal of the inquisition. The building had been vacant for some years, and Dusina was temporarily accommodated at Fort Saint Elmo in Valletta and later the Dominican convent in Birgu before settling in the Castellania. The latter continued to house Malta's inquisitors until 1798, and it became known as the Inquisitor's Palace. Dusina first heard a case as inquisitor on 25 August 1574, and he retained this role for only eight months, hearing the last case in May 1575 and probably leaving Malta within that month. He was succeeded by Pietro Sant'Umano as inquisitor. In 1575, Dusina visited every church in the Maltese Islands and kept a detailed record of them. Handwritten copies of this report are found in the National Library of Malta, the Archiepiscopal Archives and the Vatican Apostolic Archive, and they are important primary sources about Maltese history in the 16th century.

History √û√≥r was ordered on 8 November 1948. It was built in √Ölborg, Denmark and arrived in Iceland on 20 October 1951. It was originally armed with two 47 mm and one 57 mm guns. =Cod Wars= In the First Cod War, which started on 1 September 1958, Icelandic fisheries protection vessels made numerous attempts to stop British trawlers from fishing in contested waters, attempting to arrest the trawlers or cut their nets. On 29 September that year, √û√≥r fired warning shots when trying to arrest trawlers, while on 30 May 1959, √û√≥r fired on the trawler Arctic Viking, first firing warning shots and then at the trawler's masts to disable Arctic Vikings radio. The British destroyer , which was on patrol in the area, fired three star shells, after which, √û√≥r turned away and abandoned its attempts to arrest the trawler. On 29 February 1960, √û√≥r fired warning shots at the trawler Camilla. On 11 December 1975, √û√≥r, under the command of Helgi Hallvar√∞sson, was leaving port at Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, where it had been minesweeping, when orders were received to investigate the presence of unidentified foreign vessels at the mouth of the fjord.

They were sheltering from a force nine gale within Iceland's territorial waters.Storey, Norman, What price cod? : a tugmaster's view of the cod wars. Beverley, North Humberside. Hutton Press. c 1992. In the Icelandic account, when ordered to leave Icelandic territorial waters by the commander of √û√≥r, the three tugboats initially complied. However, around two nautical miles (4 km) from the coast, Star Aquarius allegedly veered to starboard and hit √û√≥rs port side as the Coast Guards attempted to overtake her. Even as √û√≥r increased speed, Lloydsman again collided with its port side. √û√≥r had suffered considerable damage by these hits and so when Star Aquarius came about, a blank round was fired from √û√≥r.

Coats wrote the first book on practical pathology, that became the bible of the profession. Life Coats was the son of William Coats and the grand-nephew of Thomas Coats family in Paisley, who were famous as thread manufacturers. Coats was educated at Paisley Grammar School before matriculating at the University of Glasgow on a arts course. However after two years, he changed faculty, against the wishes of his father. He started a medical degree at the University of Glasgow Medical School. During his third-year course, he contracted Typhus after visiting Paisley Infirmary during his holidays. In 1867 Coats graduated MB with honours. Coats was a deeply religious man, a Protestant, who believed in Sabbatarianism. Career Coat's first career position as a physician was as an assistant to William Tennant Gairdner at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He subsequently moved to University of Leipzig, to work with German physiologist Carl Ludwig and learn experimental physiology. Coats returned to Glasgow in 1869 and was appointed to the position in the Royal Infirmary as Pathologist. Upon his appointment to the Royal, he took at trip to Germany to train with German pathologist Eduard von Rindfleisch at the University of W√ºrzburg. While at the Royal, Coats specialised in Morbid anatomy and Histology. He also ensured the infirmary pathological museum was added to with new specimen's and this work led to him compiling and publishing the first catalogue of the collection in 1872. A second catalogue was published by 1878, the third publishing in 1889. In 1875, Coats was appointed to the Western Infirmary as a pathologist and continued to work in other appointments including pathologist to the Hospital for Sick Children, until his early death in 1899. The Board of the new Sick Children's Hospital appointed Dr Coats as pathologist in the initial set of appointments of honorary medical officers. At the Western Infirmary, Coats worked built up the Glasgow School of Pathology. During that period, he also acted in capacity of the dispensary physician and spent significant time studying the diseases of the throat, to enable him to open a GP surgery to earn extra money. From 1877 he became an independent lecturer, as opposed to working at an assistant to a senior physician, when he started to teach practical pathology to four students. Two years later the number of students had grown to a dozen. Professor Up until 1893, there was no professor of pathology at the University of Glasgow The university commissioners created the new Chair of Pathology at the end of 1893 and assigned it to Coats. Coming so late, Coats felt it was a mixed blessings. Although his lecture's were recognised as qualifying for the degree for a number of years, it wasn't until he joined the Western Infirmary that he became a lecturer. However, he lost his independence by the action of another professor, the Professor of the Institutes of Medicine, John Gray McKendrick who became the Regius Professor of Physiology (Glasgow) in 1976. His chair not only covered physiology but several others subjects, one of which included pathology. The professor insisted that only he could lecture on pathology, leaving Coats in the unenviable position of becoming his assistant. Being an assistant meant Coats had to pay McKendrick lecture fees on a yearly basis. Coats found this both galling and irksome, as McKendrick never held a single lecture on pathology, instead focusing his time only on physiology. When Coats was finally awarded the chair after so many years, his career as professor was cut short. Death In 1896, he started to feel pain that resulted in febrile attacks that Coats suspected of being Malaria picked up while he was in Rome. However, a year later, a tumour was discovered in his abdomen. After a visit to Australia and Egypt in 1998, his health rapidly worsened in the last months of the year and he died during the morning of 24 January 1899. Bibliography Coats was appointed editor of the Glasgow Medical Journal on 28 November 1877, at the time it was changing from a quarterly to a monthly publication. He was still the senior editor at his death, holding the position for twenty-one years. In 1883, Coats published his manual of pathology. The first edition became the standard reference textbook for Pathologists. Further editions were written by Scottish pathologists Robert Muir his successor, later still by Daniel Fowler Cappell and so on. * * References Category:1848 births Category:1899 deaths Category:People from Paisley, Renfrewshire Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Scottish pathologists Category:19th-century Scottish medical doctors Category:Academics of the University of Glasgow ","title":"Joseph Coats"},{"id":"65315622","text":"Henry Edwards Davis (11 July 1756 ‚Äì 10 February 1784) was a British author.

Protesters gathered outside the governor's mansion in Saint Paul on June 24 and called on the governor to reconvene the legislature in a special session for the purpose of passing police reform measures. Lawmakers had recently adjourned a special session without agreeing to legislation on the topic. Four years after the shooting of Philando Castile by a police officer in the Twin Cities' suburb of St. Anthony, several Black Lives Matter rallies were held on July 6 that commemorated Castile and connected it to the global protest movement about racism and police brutality sparked by Floyd's death.Forgrave, Reid (6 July 2020).\\"Remembering Philando Castile, four years later: 'We got strength in numbers now'\\".

Members of the American Indian Movement, led by Mike Forcia of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians, announced via social media their intentions to topple the statue earlier in the day. State Patrol troopers and a Department of Public Safety tribal liaison met with organizers prior to the event, encouraging them to follow a legal process for removal and warning them that they could face charges for destruction of public property. Forcia countered that they had already waited far too long, having worked through official channels for years without success. American Indian Movement members and other demonstrators, including Dakota and Ojibwe community members, looped a rope around the statue and pulled it off its granite pedestal. The group drummed, sang songs, and took photos with the fallen statue. No one was arrested at the event. State Patrol troopers watched from a distance and did not intervene. Troopers eventually formed a line to protect the statue before it was transported offsite. =Juneteenth commemoration= Juneteenth march in north Minneapolis, June 19, 2020 On June 19, dozens of Juneteenth commemorations were held in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, including in Minneapolis near the former third precinct station and at the location where Floyd died. Participants at the events connected recent instances of police brutality to the historic legacy of slavery in the United States. The Minnesota Black Lives Matter chapter that rallied at the state capitol building in Saint Paul called on state lawmakers who were meeting in a special legislative session to agree on police reform measures. Governor Walz issued a proclamation declaring it Juneteenth Day in Minnesota and encouraged the state legislature to make it a state holiday. =Pride parade protests= Despite cancellation of official Twin Cities Pride event, protesters on June 28 gathered in downtown Minneapolis and called for justice for Floyd, greater protections for black transgender people, community control of policing, and the freeing of \\"political prisoners\\". Restrictions on public gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic prevented organizers from holding a more celebratory event of LGBTQ+ people as in past years, which had been among the most well- attended Pride parade events in the United States. The 2020 Pride parade in the Twin Cities intersected with the Black Lives Matter movement and returned to the way it began, as a protest movement. =\\"Black 4th\\" rallies= Thousands took part in several peaceful demonstrations in Minneapolis and called for racial equity and justice for George Floyd on July 4.

A sprawling encampment at Powderhorn Park generated controversy as it grew to 560 tents by mid July. Numerous sexual assaults, fights, and drug use at the encampment generated alarm for nearby residents. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board later cleared the park of people living in tents, but voted to create a permitting process to make homeless encampments a permanent fixture at 20 city parks with up to 25 tents each.Ot√°rola, Miguel (22 July 2020). \\"Minneapolis Park Board clears one of the Powderhorn homeless encampments\\". Star Tribune. Retrieved 23 July 2020. The city had made a push to connect people experiencing homeless with services, including establishing three new shelters, and shelter beds remained available. But officials adopted a de-escalation for disbanding camps due to the ongoing civil unrest, and when they attempted to remove tents at non- permitted sites, they faced opposition from a sanctuary movement and protest groups. =Police station vandalized= Late at night in Minneapolis on August 15, a group of approximately 50 people marched to the city's fifth police precinct station in what was initially described as a peaceful protest, but it became violent when people threw rocks at windows, threw paint on the building, and shot commercial-grade fireworks at police officers, before fleeing the scene. In statements, Mayor Frey and Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrew Jenkins said that the destruction was not the solution to issues surrounding policing.Staff (16 August 2020). \\"Minneapolis Police: Group vandalized MPD precinct building, shot fireworks at officers\\".

The incident occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin as police officers were attempting to arrest Blake. In reaction to the incident, protests and unrest occurred in Wisconsin and other places in the United States. On August 24 in Minneapolis, a 100-person protest over Blake's shooting took place in the city's downtown area, and after the main protest group disbanded, some protesters became violent and broke windows and threatened to breach a jail facility, resulting in 11 arrests.Walsh, Paul (August 25, 2020). \\"11 protesting Kenosha police shooting arrested after jail damaged in Minneapolis\\" .

Surveillance video showed that Sole Jr. had died by suicide, a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, during a manhunt for a homicide suspect in which he was the person of interest as police officers closed in to arrest him after a foot chase. Controversially, the police released the CCTV camera footage of the suicide in attempts to stop the unrest. Overnight destruction from August 26 to 27 reached a total of 72 property locations in Minneapolis and four locations in neighboring Saint Paul. In Minneapolis, four businesses were set on fire, including a downtown restaurant and three other businesses located miles away from the city's downtown area. State and local officials arrested a total of 132 people during the unrest and charged 27 people for crimes such as assault and burglary related to the rioting and looting. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz declared a state of emergency and deployed National Guard troops, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed on overnight curfew. Nearly 1,000 members of law enforcement and 400 Minnesota National Guard troops amassed in the metro area to prevent more lawlessness, and calmness prevailed after August 27. =Wall of Forgotten Natives= Two years after a large camp was disbanded near Hiawatha and Franklin avenues in Minneapolis, on September 3 a group backed by protesters and American Indian Movement advocates re-occupied a site they referred to as the Wall of Forgotten Natives. The site had been barricaded by the state in 2018 when an encampment closed after experiencing drug overdoses, spread of disease, violence, fires, and deaths. In September 2020, reoccupation of the encampment with 40 tents came after the city closed another encampment on 13th Avenue due to health and safety concerns and after officials sought help from nonprofit organizations. Reestablishment of the Hiawatha encampment also came during time of increasing confrontation between Minneapolis officials and homeless advocates, as the city had hoped to close all encampments by October.

The current horse was cut 1924 by John T, Ade, Mr. Bovis and Eric Hobbis in a single night and stands at 93 feet long and 65 feet high, with a previous horse cut in ever 1838 or 1860 occupying the same hill. The horse has been owned by the National Trust since 1991, who regularly clean and maintain the horse along with local volunteers. Original Litlington White Horse The origin and date of the original White Horse is debated. One view is that it was created by a James Pagden of Frog Firle Farm, along with his two brothers in 1838, to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria. Another view is that the horse was cut in 1860 by two local boys, noticing a patch of bare chalk resembling a horses head, they proceeded to cut away the rest of the horse. Current White Horse The current horse was carved by John T, Ade, Mr. Bovis and Eric Hobbis one night in 1924, with one of these men possible being a great-grandson of the original horse's creature. During a full moon, the men cut the horse without the knowledge of the local residents, who awoke, startled by the horses appears on the side of the hill, this possibly being the motivation behind the horses cutting. The horse has since been marinated by local residence, with the exception of the horse being covered in the late 1930s as it was seen as a possible location marker for the Luftwaffe in World War II. The uncovering of the horse after 1945 resulted in several changes to the horse's original shape, with only one leg being recut. The East Sussex County Council scoured the horse in the late 1980's, it was at this time that the horse was changed from a standing position to a prancing position, in order to prevent a slippage of chalk rubble used to fill the figure.

History =Foundation= In 1819, under the leadership of Louis Saulet (1796-1862), who had just been ordained a priest of the Diocese of Bayeux, a small group of priests and seminarians in the diocese saw the great challenge still existing in re-establishing the Catholic faith to a population devastated by the destruction of Church institutions during the French Revolution and the social disruption left in the wake of the Napoleonic era. Inspired by the model of the Society of Missionaries for France recently founded in Lyons, the group determined to form themselves into a religious congregation, subject to religious vows. They committed themselves to serve the diocese as missionaries to the local populace, working to revive their practice of the Catholic faith and deepen it through spiritual retreats. Given the approval of the local bishop, Charles Brault, for this enterprise, in 1820 they acquired the chateau of Sommervieu, which became their motherhouse. The bishop soon charged the new community of priests to help in the pastoral care of pilgrims to the Basilica of Our Lady of Deliverance in Douvres, the major Marian shrine of Normandy, as the regular team of priests on staff at the shrine were overwhelmed by the large number of visitors. By 1824 the group was sufficiently established to elect a Superior General, to which office Saulet was elected as the first to serve in it. Saulet became the confessor of a young nobleman, Henriette Le Forestier d'Osseville, who had felt a call to found a new religious of women to need the social needs of young women in the region. He gave her the advice and support needed to assist her in the establishment of the Sisters of Our Lady of Fidelity in 1831. The association between their congregations was to last throughout the history of the men's community. Choosing to remain a congregation of diocesan right, the Missionaries remained a part of the diocese, under the authority of its bishop, and serving just within that diocese. While remaining stable, as a consequence they never grew in large numbers. By 1904, they numbered some 80 members, both priests and Religious Brothers, with twenty men in training for their way of life in their novitiate. =Dispersal and rebirth= In July 1904, the French government broke off relations with the Holy See, abrogating the nation's concordat with the Catholic Church. As a consequence of the resulting Law of Separation, the government banned the operation of all religious orders in the country and seized their properties. Many members of the religious orders went into exile in other countries, both in Europe and North America. This was the fate also of the Missionary Fathers, who lost their motherhouse in Sommervieu. Relations between France and the Church were repaired in 1921, at which time many surviving members of French religious communities who had lived in exile returned to their homeland. Their communities began the process of rebuilding their lives in France, and many were able to recover their properties. The Missionary Fathers were not among them and, under the leadership of their Superior, P√®re Jeanne, they found new headquarters in Douvres-la-D√©livrande. Over the next century, the Missionaries gave their services to the now-named Diocese of Bayeux and Lisieux in various ways. Some taught at the diocesan minor seminary, while others served in local parishes or served as chaplains to communities of Religious Sisters in the region. Ending The numbers of the congregation dwindled during the century following their return to France. The last member of the congregation, Daniel L√©cluse (1926-2016), served throughout his ministry at various times as a teacher and in parishes. He was buried in the plot of the congregation in the municipal cemetery, ending the history of the congregation.

In preparation for the European Football Championship EURO 2012, 10 high-speed electric trains Hyundai Rotem were purchased by Ukrzaliznytsia (6 trains were delivered before the start of the Championship, and another 4 after its end). At the same time, the Kryukivsky plant began to create a high-speed train with a maximum speed of 200-220 km/h. However, the plant was unable to fully develop and certify its train before the start of the tournament. At that time, the train was only undergoing factory tests and running-in. As of January 31, 2013, the interdepartmental acceptance commission of Ukrzaliznytsia accepted the first train EKr1-001 \\"Tarpan\\" for operation.

Following his killing, the police and several Israeli ministers, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, falsely accused Abu Al-Qia'an of having been a terrorist and affiliated with the Islamic State. In September 2020, Netanyahu apologized to Abu al-Qia'an's family, claiming that the police had misled him. The police were not only faulted on for shooting Abu Al-Qia'an and then not providing medical assistance, thereby, allowing him to bleed to death but also for labeling him a terrorist without proof, for allegedly shooting a sponge-tipped bullet in the head of an Arab-Israeli politician at the scene, and for suppressing evidence that would have cleared Abu Al-Qia'an.  Background  Abu Al-Qia'an lived in the village of Umm al-Hiran in the Negev desert in southern Israel. Like the other villagers, Abu Al-Qia'an was a Bedouin. Bedouins have the lowest socioeconomic status of any group in Israel. Abu Al- Qia'an worked as a math teacher and was the first Israeli Bedouin with a Ph.D in chemistry. The villagers in Umm al-Hiran belong to the Abu Alkian tribe. Israel undertook a program of relocating Negev Bedouins in the 1950s, causing the tribe to end up in the Wadi Atir area, northeast of Beersheba, in 1956. The tribe was allowed to settle there and it built two villages; Umm al-Hiran and Atir. Despite permitting the tribe to settle Umm al-Hiran, the authorities classifies it as an unrecognized Bedouin village, meaning that they consider it illegally built. For years they had tried to destroy the village to make room for two planned Jewish towns, Kesif and Hiran, and to transfer the villagers into the nearby Bedouin town Hura. Most of the villagers resisted the attempts to remove them from Umm al-Hiran. On January 18, 2017 a demolition team, escorted by police, was scheduled to tear down Abu Al- Qia'an's house and other houses in Umm al-Hiran. A non-violent protest had been organized, by, among others, Ayman Odeh, leader of the Arab-dominated Joint List party, to meet the demolition team.  Incident  Houses demolition in Umm al-Hiran Before dawn, Wednesday January 18, 2017, the demolition team arrived at the village to carry out the demolitions. They were met by a large group of protesters. According to a relative of Abu Al-Qia'an, he was sleeping when another relative of his called him to warn him about the imminent demolitions. He took the valuables out of his home and packed them into his SUV. He said he couldn't bear watching his home being razed and got in his car to drive away. At 5:57 am, as he was leaving, driving at a speed of less than 10 km/h, police shot at least four times at his car and hit him twice. The bullet wounds caused him to lose control of his car which accelerated, careened downhill and hit a group of police officers, killing 34-year-old 1st Sgt Erez Levi and moderately wounding another officer. The car came to a stop a few seconds later and its horn started blaring. Medical teams rushed around Levi, pronounced him dead, and attended to the wounded officer. A policeman opened the door of Abu Al-Qia'an's car and partially removed his body to stop the blaring, but he was otherwise left unattended, only 10 meters from the spot where his car had hit Levi. There, he bled to death while police prevented an ambulance from reaching him. According to the autopsy report, Abu Al-Qia'an was hit with two bullets; one in the right knee, shattering it, and one in an artery in his chest, causing his death due to blood loss about fifteen minutes later. Odeh claimed that the police had used extreme levels of violence against the protestors. He was shot in the forehead and in the back with sponge-tipped bullets when he and other protestors tried to approach Abu Al-Qia'an's car and had to be taken to a hospital. The police falsely claimed that Odeh's head injury was caused by protesters throwing stones and accidentally hitting him. During the day, five Arab-Israeli politicians, Hanin Zoabi, Jamal Zahalka, Osama Saadi, Ahmad Tibi, and Aida Touma-Sliman arrived in the village to show solidarity with the protesters. The police prevented everyone else from entering the village.  Immediate responses  thumb thumb = January 18 = Witnesses at the scene claimed that Abu Al-Qia'an had lost control of his car after policemen had fired on it. But the police claimed that they had fired at his car because he had attempted a car-ramming attack. Netanyahu wrote: \\"I send my condolences to the family 1st Sgt. Erez Levi. Erez was an outstanding policeman, the son of a policeman, and he was killed this morning in a ramming attack.\\" Later, adding in a statement that \\"[h]e was killed in a vehicular terror attack.\\" Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan wrote on Facebook that Levi had been murdered: \\"Erez [Levi] was murdered while performing his duties at the mere age of 34.\\" He also accused Odeh and other members of the Joint List of being accomplices to the presumed terrorist: \\"This blood is on your hands too. This is a serious statement, I know. But not serious like your actions on this day, you are a disgrace to the country.\\" Later that day, the police posted an aerial thermal imaging video of the incident on Facebook, writing: \\"In the film you can see the terrorist standing on the side of the road with the lights of his car off, and the minute he notices the team of [police] he accelerates at them and hits them.\\" In the video, Abu Al-Qia'an's car was seen driving slowly and cautiously along a dirt track until being fired upon by the police. Then the car suddenly accelerated and veered down a steep slope, hitting a group of police officers. Since the video was taken with a thermal imaging camera, it was impossible to see if the lights were on or off. Witnesses insisted that the video corroborated their testimonies, but police and Israeli officials maintained that it showed that the car-ramming was deliberate. Police Deputy Commander Peretz Amar said that the incident was a terror attack: \\"This is clear. This is a fact. There is no other explanation, and anyone who tries to offer an alternative explanation wasn't here at the time and doesn't understand.\\" \\"A vehicle driven by a terrorist from the Islamic Movement intended to strike a number of officers and carry out an attack,\\" police spokesperson Mickey Rosenfeld said in a statement. Erdan, referring to the aerial video, attacked the media: \\"Why, for God‚Äôs sake, your instincts, your part, is always in favor of the attacker? ... Just this minute the video that was taken from the air and documented the terrorist attack was released. The film refutes the lies. I hope you will have the courage and decency to apologize for the unholy balance you made between the police forces acting in all our names to enforce the law and the violent thieves who are backing a disgusting murder.\\" Levi's funeral was held in the afternoon. At the funeral, Police Commissioner Roni Alsheikh asserted that Levi was the victim of a terror attack: \\"[Abu al-Qia'an] spread incitement at a school where six other teachers have been arrested for they affiliation with the Islamic State ... The terrorist looked for a group of police officers, accelerated and then hit them.\\" Meanwhile, the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel convened in Umm al-Hiran and declared three days of mourning as well as a day-long general strike for the next day. Last December, the Supreme Court had ordered the evacuation of the Amona outpost (type of Israeli settlement). The outpost was illegally built on private Palestinian- owned land in the West Bank. The Joint List alleged the demolitions in Umm al- Hiram and other Arab towns were carried out to appease the right-wing that was unhappy with losing a settlement. According to Odeh, the villagers had tried to negotiate with the authorities the night before and were close to reaching a deal, but Netanyahu had turned them down: \\"We reached a compromise that the residents of Umm al-Hiran accepted. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has already marked the Arab population as public enemy number one, cruelly decided to destroy an entire village, to shoot and kick men, women, and children.\\" The Prime Minister's office declined to comment on Odeh's allegations. = January 19 = Erdan in an interview with Israeli Army Radio accused Abu Al-Qia'an of having been a terrorist. He said that police had found newspaper headlines about car-ramming attacks and the Islamic State in Abu Al-Qia'an's home: When asked whether he was jumping to conclusions, Erdan insisted that Israeli media should trust the police's version: \\"I think that Israeli media, and I specifically mean Israel's media, should first take the version of events of those who represent Israel's citizens and are charged with law enforcement, which is the police, [and the not the version] of outlaws and place them side by side.\\" = January 20 = Eyal Weizman of Forensic Architechture. On Friday, thousands of Palestinians gathered in Umm al-Hiran to bury Abu Al-Qia'an. However, the police still suspected him of terrorism and therefore refused to hand over his body. Abu Al-Qia'an's brother accused the Israeli police of holding his brothers body hostage, \\"to make more convincing their ridiculous story that he is a terrorist.\\" On Twitter, Odeh shared a two-minute-long video analysis titled Visual Investigation: Police shooting, car ramming at Umm el-Hiran (Jan 18, 2017). The video had been produced by British Forensic Architecture, led by Eyal Weizman of Goldsmiths, University of London, and Activestills and published the day before by the Israeli peace group +972 Magazine. The police replied to Odeh's tweet: \\"Manipulative edit will not change reality. The documentation of the killing proves an intention to murder policemen. This has one name: terror. No clip that distorts evidence will change that.\\" In the evening, Channel 10 reported on Abu Al-Qia'an's leaked autopsy report which challenged the police's version of the incident. The report concluded that Abu Al-Qia'an bled to death, leading Ksenia Svetlova of Zionist Union to comment that \\"it's Azaria case number two,\\" a reference to the Hebron shooting incident where an Israeli medic executed a subdued Palestinian attacker. = January 21 = Thousands of primarily Palestinian citizens of Israel demonstrated in the northern Wadi Ara against house demolitions and over the killing of Abu Al-Qia'an. Odeh spoke at the demonstrations and called for an official committee of inquiry \\"to uncover the lies of Netanyahu, Erdan and the police.\\"  Investigations  State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan led one of the investigations. In early February 2017, more clips of the killing of Abu Al-Qia'an surfaced. In one of them, he is seen driving with his lights on, contradicting the police's claim that they were off. In August 2017, an investigation by the Israeli Police Internal Investigations Department (PIID) cleared the officer who shot Abu Al-Qia'an of any wrongdoing. Two months later, a new investigation led by State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan was opened. But in April 2018, that investigation too cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. It further stated that it could not rule out that Abu Al-Qia'an had attempted a terrorist attack. Nitzan's decision to close the investigation disappointed members of Abu Al-Qia'an's family. Odeh said that Alsheikh had \\"orchestrated a campaign of incitement\\" by accusing Abu Al-Qia'an of terrorism. A third investigation was conducted by Ariel Livneh of Forensic Architecture, based on documents from Shin Bet and the Police Investigations Department. The investigation's report was released in February 2020. It concluded that the only evidence of Abu Al-Qia'an's alleged terror ties were Islamic education material found in his home. It further asserted that Abu Al- Qia'an was shot for no reason and would have survived had he received treatment. But the police denied him that and fired on activists who approached his car, including Odeh. Further evidence of police misconduct came in September when Channel 12 reporte Amit Segal revealed that Nitzan suppressed evidence that would have challenged Alsheikh's assertion that Abu Al-Qia'an was a terrorist. = Shooting of Odeh = MK Ayman Odeh claimed that he was shot in the head. Another point of contention was over Odeh's head injury. He claimed that police had shot him in the forehead with a sponge- tipped bullet, and as he turned around in pain, another time in the back. The police disputed that and, initially, claimed that Odeh was hit with stray stones thrown by protestors and that the officers in Umm al-Hiran weren't even equipped with weapons firing sponge-tipped bullets. The police's story was refuted by a witness, rabbi Arik Ascherman, who wrote:Arik Ascherman 'Eyewitness Account of the Preventable Umm Al Hiran Tragedy,' The Times of Israel 26 January 2017 The police later denied that any statement had ever been issued regarding the circumstances of Odeh's injury. The report of a forensic probe into the Umm al-Hiran incident by the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute was released on January 31, 2017. Regarding Odeh's head injuries, it stated that \\"the injuries 'were consistent' with injuries caused by sponge- tipped bullets\\", though \\"[i]t is not possible to nail down [with certainty] the form of the injurious objects, but at the same time, the location of the injury and the form could have been caused as [Odeh] claimed.\\"Jack Khoury, Jonathan Lis, 'Forensic Probe Fails to Determine What Injured Israeli Arab Lawmaker at Bedouin Village Protest,' Haaretz 1 February 2017 Erdan hailed the report as a vindication, asserting that Odeh was a \\"lying lawbreaker who has fanned the flames and stood at the head of a violent group\\". PIID opened an investigation into the matter after Odeh filed a complaint. But closed the investigation in September 2018 with the motivation that \\"[e]ven with the assumption that the object that hit [Odeh] was fired by police, it could not be determined who of the officers had done so.\\" Odeh appealed the closure of the investigation in March 2019. In 2018, Forensic Architecture released a documentary about the killing of Abu Al-Qia'an called The Long Duration of a Split Second. The documentary was based on new evidence obtained by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel and included body camera footage from the police officers. One of the police officers was heard shouting \\"Give them sponge! Give the sponge!\\" The following 47 seconds of the footage was redacted and the group believed that is when Odeh was shot. In conjunction with the release of the documentary, Weizman stated that both the policeman that shot Abu Al-Qia'an and the one that shot Odeh should be put on trial. Forensic Architecture was nominated for the 2018 Turner Prize for their work relating to Al-Qia'an's killing.'A gunshot, a speech, a whisper': The art detectives exposing Middle East crimes, 31 December 2018, by Joseph Fahim, Middle East Eye  Apologies  Uri Ariel was the first minister to apologize to Abu Al- Qia'an's family. On March 6, 2017, Minister of Agriculture, Uri Ariel, became the first politician to issue an apology over having accused Abu Al-Qia'an of terrorism. On September 8, 2020, Netanyahu also apologized to Abu Al-Qia'an's family, claiming that the police had misled him: \\"I would like to express, in my name, my apologies to the Al-Qi‚Äôan family. They [the police] said he was a terrorist. Yesterday, it turned out that he wasn‚Äôt a terrorist.\\" Netanyahu also used the moment to connect the terrorism allegations against Abu Al- Qia'an with the ongoing corruption investigation against himself. \\"What we‚Äôve seen is an amazing thing: There are [existing] political investigations, investigations that were tainted from the get-go,\\" he said, implying that he too was the victim of a coverup. Touma-Suleiman accused Netanyahu of opportunism, noting that the evidence exonerating Abu Al-Qia'an had been there for three years: \\"Netanyahu and his associates were the ones who turned Abu al-Qia‚Äôan into a ‚Äòterrorist‚Äô ‚Äî them and their racist incitement against Arabs.\\" She called for him to resign: \\"If Netanyahu really wants to apologize, he has only one option ‚Äî to resign.\\" Bezalel Smotrich of the Jewish Home party also apologized for calling Abu al-Qia‚Äôan a terrorist. As of 2020, Alsheikh, Erdan, and Nitzan, who also publicly called Abu al-Qia‚Äôan a terrorist has not apologized. Abu Al-Qia'an's widow said the apology was \\"better late than never\\" but complained that her family was still homeless after the authorities had demolished their home over three years ago. Abu Al-Qia'an's brother said Yacoub was murdered: \\"We know the truth. We knew it from the first moment, because we all know who Yaqoub was. Yaqoub ‚Äî a beloved leader, educator, father and brother ‚Äî was murdered in cold blood.\\"  See also  * 2017 in the State of Palestine * 2020 in the State of Palestine * House demolition in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict * List of violent incidents in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, 2017  External links  * Israeli police video of officers killing Bedouin math teacher Ya'akub Abu Al-Qi'an * Interview with activist at Umm al-Hiran, January 18, 2017.

Early life She was born in 1628 as Lilias Gillespie, one of eight children born to Lilias n√©e Simson (d. 1627), the daughter of Patrick Simson, the minister of Stirling, and John Gillespie (d. 1627 or c.1647), the minister of Kirkcaldy. Her father's date of death is uncertain, being either around the time of Skene's birth or just after her marriage in 1646. Her brothers included the Church of Scotland ministers Patrick Gillespie, Principal of the University of Glasgow, and George Gillespie, a member of the Westminster Assembly.DesBrisay, Gordon Skene (n√©e Gillespie), Lilias (Lillias Skein) (1626/7‚Äì1697): Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Published online: 23 September 2004 Marriage and Conversion On 26 August 1646 at Kirkcaldy she married the Aberdeen merchant Alexander Skene (c1621‚Äì1694), a magistrate and the author of Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland. From 1649 to 1871 he held various offices in Aberdeen, including Treasurer of the Town Council, Dean of Guild, Baillie and a leading man in the church courts. Moving to Aberdeen to live with her husband, between 1647 and 1669 the couple had ten children, their oldest surviving son being John Skene (c.1649‚Äì1690) who was to become Deputy Governor of West Jersey from 1684 to 1687.The Papers of William Penn, ed. M. M. Dunn, R. S. Dunn, and others, 2 (1982) 96n., 105n Skene and her husband were avowed Covenanters (a 17th-century Scottish religious and political movement, who supported a Presbyterian Church of Scotland) who were admired for their deep faith at a time when their strict Presbyterianism was out of favour following the Restoration. In 1669 Skene suddenly converted to Quakerism, with her husband joining her in 1672. Of this time she wrote, 'It is very well known to all that lived in the place where I sojourned, I was none who conversed with them, I was never at one of their meetings, I never read one of their books', yet she experienced 'that thing the school-men call Immediat Objective Revelation'.Lilias Skein, An Expostulatory Epistle, Directed to Robert Macquare, (1678), in R. Barclay, Robert Barclay's apology for the true Christian divinity vindicated from John Brown's examination and pretended confutation thereof (1679), p. 203 While the citizens of Aberdeen knew her as Lilias Gillespie, among the Quaker community she was known by her husband's surname. The Quaker community in Aberdeen was small but became increasingly influential, having Robert Barclay and George Keith in its congregation and Skene was the leading female figure in it, having a position equal to the men when dealing with disciplinary matters, while religious meetings were often held in the Skenes' home. In about 1678 Skene was involved in setting up the first Quaker school in Scotland. Her leadership was much in evidence during the years of persecution of the Quaker community between 1676 and 1679 when every male Quaker in Aberdeen, almost 30 in number including her husband, oldest son and son-in-law, were imprisoned for months or years. The women of the community were not imprisoned and were free to meet and petition for the release of their menfolk. Her searing letter of 31 March 1677 entitled 'Word of Warning to the Magistrates and Inhabitants of Aberdeen' publicly took to task the Magistrates, the ministers and the people of Aberdeen and was published in the local newspapers. In the letter she mentioned her own preaching 'at severall seasons and in diverse maners I have witnessed' while also condemning the imprisoning of 'honest men that have families wives and children ... in those cold nasty stinking holes where ye have shutt them up, who have been as neatly handled and tenderly educated and as usefull in their generation as any amongst you'.'Brieff account of the most material passages', pp, 37‚Äì9 It is likely that in the 1680s she helped her husband write his two manuscript accounts of the history of Quakerism in Aberdeen. Influence In 1676 Robert Barclay persuaded Skene to write to Elisabeth of the Palatinate (1618‚Äì1680), the Calvinist cousin of the Stuart kings, in an attempt to convert her. The Quakers hoped Elisabeth would intervene on their behalf with her royal relatives in Britain even though their attempt at evangelising her failed. Barclay introduced Skene to Elisabeth as 'a woman of great experience and tenderness of heart who through great tribulations both of body and mind hath attained the earnest of the Kingdom [but whose] husband and son-in-law are now in Prison'.W. Hull, William Penn and the Dutch migration to Pennsylvania (1935), p. 27 Skene corresponded with the princess and her companion, Countess Anna Maria van Hoorn, and was invited to visit them at Herford Abbey in Westphalia, where Elisabeth was the Abbess. Skene's letters have not survived but are referred to in correspondence between Barclay and the Princess.Reliquiae Barclaianae: Correspondence of Colonel David Barclay and Robert Barclay of Urie and His Son Robert, (London: privately published, 1870), pp. 7, 8, 14, 20‚Äì3 The biographer of George Keith says that Skene went with Keith, Barclay, George Fox and William Penn on their tour of the Netherlands and Germany during the summer of 1677. Similarly, Barclay wrote that Skene intended to go but Penn and Fox do not mention her in their writings about the trip,The Papers of William Penn, ed. M. M. Dunn, R. S. Dunn, and others, Vol. 2 (1982) and in a letter written to Skene in 1678 Elisabeth seems to be implying that the two had not actually met, writing: 'I love your upright intention to travail (i.e. toil) in spirit for your friends, though unknown to you'.Hull, p. 33 During the summer of 1677 Skene was actually in London and also found time to visit the philosopher Anne Conway at her home, Ragley Hall in Worcestershire. Conway, a recent convert to Quakerism, was bedridden and Skene befriended her and the two began a correspondenceThe Conway Letters: The Correspondence of Anne, Viscountess Conway, Henry More, and their Friends, 1642‚Äì1684, ed. by Marjorie Hope Nicols, rev. ed. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1992), p. 438 with Skene organising from Aberdeen the hiring of Quaker servants for Conway's home. Later life and writings Skene's letters and poems are among the few writings still extant today of a 17th-century Scottish woman who was not an aristocrat.DesBrisay, Gordon 'Lilias Skene: A Quaker Poet and her ‚ÄòCursed Self', Woman and the Feminine in Medieval and Early Modern Scottish Writing, pp 162-177 Her only known publication during her lifetime (in which the author referred to her as Lillias Skein) was 'An Expostulatory Epistle, Directed to Robert Macquare' (1678) included in one of Robert Barclay's works in 1679. Macquare (known today as Robert MacWard) was a Presbyterian dissenter whose hate-filled writings against the Quakers had previously persuaded her husband Alexander Skene to write and print a rebuttal. Lilias Skene's 'Epistle' against Macquare was balanced but to the point, commenting: 'O Robert! thy hard speeches have manifested thy own sad acknowledgement to be very true, the Holy fire is gone out with thee indeed'.Skein, p. 201 The 19th-century literary historian William Walker published selections from thirty-three lyric poems and three anagrams written by her between 1665 and 1697, 1,472 lines in total transcribed from an original manuscript in the private papers of a previous owner that are now lost, presumably accidentally burnt after the death of the owner.W. Walker, The Bards of Bon-Accord, 1375‚Äì1860 (1887), pp. 85‚Äì102 Lilias Skene's poetry and prose were heavy with mystical allusions and scriptural images of suffering and salvation. The Aberdeenshire poll-tax book for 1696 states that the now widowed Skene was living in modest circumstances in Aberdeen with her daughter Anna and two servants. Here she died in June 1697 aged 68 and was buried beside her husband in an unmarked grave in the Quaker burial-ground at Kingswells. Today there is a plaque dedicated to Lilias Skene on a wall near the entrance of the Crown Street Meeting house in Aberdeen in addition to an information board about her at the Tollhouse were the Quaker men were imprisoned during her lifetime.
