Biography Born on May 30, 1918, in the Bronx as Bernard Wessler, to Russian-Jewish immigrants; he earned his undergraduate degree from Baruch College, earning a Bachelor of Business Science in advertising. West worked as a nightclub comedian, and performed on tour with the U.S.O. in the Pacific Theatre after being rejected from the military based on medical issues. As part of the comedy duo Ross & West, he toured the hotel circuit in the Catskills and Poconos with Ross Martin, quipping, \\"Everything we did may not have been original, but what we stole was good!\\" After Martin left, he was replaced by Mickey Ross, a college friend of West's who changed his name from Isadore Rovinsky so that the comedy duo could retain the Ross & West name. =Broadway= West appeared on Broadway in the 1956 production of Bells Are Ringing, creating the role of Dr. Kitchell, the song-writing dentist on stage and appearing in the 1960 film version starring Judy Holliday and Dean Martin. He also appeared in 1962's All American by Mel Brooks and starring Ray Bolger, Poor Bitos with Donald Pleasence, The Beauty Part with Bert Lahr and the 1969 production of The Front Page alongside Helen Hayes.

The trio wrote and produced The Jeffersons, another spinoff from All in the Family that ran for a decade starting in 1975. They created, produced, and wrote for the short-lived situation comedy The Dumplings, whose pilot aired in 1975 and which ran as a weekly series in early 1976. In 1977, they created Three's Company, which ran until 1984, as well as that show's less-successful spinoffs The Ropers and Three's a Crowd. Together with his wife Mimi, who died in April 2004, West was a generous contributor to the Los Angeles Free Clinic. She had first discovered the Clinic after driving her husband to his job writing for All in the Family. West regularly contributed a portion of his salary while his wife worked there without pay. In 1997, the couple donated $500,000 towards the provision of pediatric dental care for those children without access to dentists.Oliver, Myrna. \\"Miriam 'Mimi' West, 81; Raised Millions for the L.A.

His writings have focused on creative strategies cities can use to reduce their ecological footprints and become more livable and equitable places in the process. Beatley coined the term green urbanism and uses it frequently in his writings to describe the planning process used to create a sustainable city.  Academic Background  Beatley received a PhD in City and Regional Planning from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1986. He is currently \\"Teresa Heinz Professor of Sustainable Communities\\" in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning, the University of Virginia School of Architecture. His primary teaching and research interests are in environmental planning and policy, with special emphasis on coastal and natural hazards planning, environmental values and ethics, and biodiversity conservation. He has been a prolific author since the mid-1980s on the subjects of coastal hazard mitigation, hurricane recovery, habitat and ecosystem conservation, environmental ethics, and sustainable urban planning. His 2010 book Biophilic Cities: Integrating Nature Into Urban Design and Planning advocates putting the biophilia hypothesis into practice with an outline of the essential elements of a biophilic city and examples and stories about cities that have successfully integrated biophilic elements.  Green Urbanism  In his recent works surveying sustainable cities in Europe and Australia, Beatley argues that although cities typically consume large quantities of fossil fuels and generate enormous amounts of waste and pollution, they are the most important centers for positive environmental change. Beatley notes that the high population density that characterizes most cities (especially European cities) also means that land is used efficiently, that automobiles are not the primary mode of transportation, and that per capita consumption of resources is low. Beatley's description of a typical sustainable city is one that is compact and walkable with easily accessible parks and green spaces. Such a city also would emphasize sustainable forms of mobility, such as public transportation and bicycles. Parallel to Beatley's studies, the concept of green urbanism has been discussed by Steffen Lehmann in Australia, for instance in his book The Principles of Green Urbanism (Earthscan, London, 2010) and in the journal S.A.P.I.EN.S.Lehmann, S. (2010) ‚ÄúGreen urbanism: formulating a series of holistic principles‚Äù. S.A.P.I.EN.S. 3 (2) In Beatley‚Äôs view, a city exemplifies green urbanism if it (1) strives to live within its ecological limits, (2) is designed to function in ways analogous to nature, (3) strives to achieve a circular rather than a linear metabolism, (4) strives toward local and regional self-sufficiency, (5) facilitates more sustainable lifestyles, and (6) emphasizes a high quality of neighborhood and community life. Beatley uses these six points to define Green Urbanism as a different type of New Urbanism, and therefore an ecological movement, although others have interpreted Beatley's definition to be simply an alternative type of urban design.

Lean integration has parallels with other lean disciplines such as lean manufacturing, lean IT, and lean software development. It is a specialized collection of tools and techniques that address the unique challenges associated with seamlessly combining information and processes from systems that were independently developed, are based on incompatible data models, and remain independently managed, to achieve a cohesive holistic operation. History Lean integration was first introduced by John Schmidt in a series of blog articles starting in January 2009 entitled 10 Weeks To Lean Integration.Original Lean Integration Blog Series This was followed by a white paperLean Integration White Paper on the topic in April 2009 and the book Lean Integration, An Integration Factory Approach to Business Agility John G.Schmidt, David Lyle (2010) Lean Integration: An Integration Factory Approach to Business Agility, Addison- Wesley Pearson Education, in May 2010. Overview Lean integration builds on the same set of principles that were developed for lean manufacturing and lean software development which is based on the Toyota Production System. Integration solutions can be broadly categorized as either Process Integration or Data Integration. The book is based on the premise that Integration is an ongoing activity and not a one-time activity; therefore integration should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization. John Schmidt and David Lyle initially articulated in their book the reasons for maintaining an efficient and sustainable integration team. Lean integration as an integration approach must be sustainable and holistic unlike other integration approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. Lean integration drives elimination of waste by adopting reusable elements, high automation and quality improvements. Lean is a data- driven, fact-based methodology that relies on metrics to ensure that the quality and performance are maintained at a high level. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of lean integration principles. The predominant organizational model is the Integration Competency Center which may be structured as a central group or a more loosely coupled federated team. Lean integration principles The principles of Lean Integration may at first glance appear similar to that of Six Sigma but there are some very clear differences between them. Six-Sigma is an analytical technique that focuses on quality and reduction of defects while Lean is a management system that focuses on delivering value to the end customer by continuously improving value delivery processes. Lean provides a robust framework that facilitates improving efficiency and effectiveness by focusing on critical customer requirements. As mentioned in lean integration there are seven core lean integration principles vital for deriving significant and sustainable business benefits. They are as below: # Focus on the customer and eliminate waste: Waste elimination should be viewed from the customer perspective and all activities that do not add value to the customer needs to be looked at closely and eliminated or reduced. In an integration context, the customer is often an internal sponsor or group within an organization that uses, benefits from, or pays for, the integrated capabilities. # Continuously improve: A data driven cycle of hypothesis-validation-implementation should be used to drive innovation and continuously improve the end-to-end process. Adopting and institutionalizing lessons learned and sustaining integration knowledge are related concepts that assist in the establishment of this principle. # Empower the team: Creating cross-functional teams and sharing commitments across individuals empower the teams and individuals who have a clear understanding of their roles and the needs of their customers. The team is also provided the support by senior management to innovate and try new ideas without fear of failure. # Optimize the whole: Adopt a big-picture perspective of the end-to- end process and optimize the whole to maximize the customer value. This may at times require performing individual steps and activities that appear to be sub-optimal when viewed in isolation, but aid in streamlining the end-to-end process. # Plan for change: Application of mass customization techniques like leveraging automated tools, structured processes, and reusable and parameterized integration elements leads to reduction in cost and time in both the build and run stages of the integration life-cycle. Another key technique is a middleware services layer that presents applications with enduring abstractions of data through standardized interfaces, allowing the underlying data structures to change without necessarily impacting the dependent applications. # Automate processes: Automation of tasks increases the ability to respond to large integration projects as effectively as small changes. In its ultimate form, automation eliminates integration dependencies from the critical implementation path of projects. # Build quality in : Process excellence is emphasized and quality is built in rather than inspected in. A key metric for this principle is First Time Through (FTT) percentage which is a measure of the number of times an end-to-end process is executed without having to do any rework or repeat any of the steps. Benefits of lean integration The Lean integration practices transforms integration from an art into a science, a repeatable and teachable methodology that shifts the focus from integration as a point-in-time activity to integration as a sustainable activity that enables organizational agility. Once an organization adopts the integration as a science it enhances the organization‚Äôs ability to change rapidly without comprising on the IT risk or quality thereby transforming the organization into an agile data driven enterprise. The following are the advantages derived by adopting the lean integration practices: # Efficiency: typical improvements are in the scale of 50% labor productivity improvements and 90% lead-time reduction through continuous efforts to eliminate waste. # Agility: Reusable components, highly automated processes and self-service delivery models improve the agility of the organization. # Data quality: quality and reliability of data is enhanced and data becomes a real asset. # Governance: metrics are established that drive continuous improvement. # Innovation: innovation is facilitated by using fact- based approach. # Staff Morale: IT staff is kept engaged with high morale driving bottom-up improvements.

The Psalmus was commissioned to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the unification of Buda, Pest and √ìbuda for a gala performance on 19 November 1923 along with the Dance Suite by B√©la Bart√≥k, and the Festival Overture by Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi, who conducted the concert. The work's first performance outside Hungary took place under Volkmar Andreae in Z√ºrich on 18 June 1926. This marked a turning point in the international recognition of Kod√°ly as a composer, beyond his renown as an ethnomusicologist and music educator.  Background  The text is based on the gloss of Psalm 55, \\"Give ear to my prayer, oh God\\", by 16th-century poet, preacher, and translator . Uncommonly, Kod√°ly chose a sacred text to mark a secular occasion; the libretto's passages of despair and call to God provide opportunities for the composer to address Hungary's tragic past and disastrous post-Trianon Treaty predicament, when it lost over 70% of its national territory. The music reflects the nation's crisis during and after World War I (the partition of the historical Hungary), and the text draws a parallel between the sorrows of King David and the suffering of the Magyars in Ottoman Hungary. Thus, the Psalmus Hungaricus encompasses two and a half millennia of political distress.All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music, Chris Woodstra, Gerald Brennan, Allen Schrott (eds.), Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005, p. 695.  Description  At the beginning of the first movement, a terse orchestral prelude yields quickly to a brief subdued choral entry. The solo tenor follows closely with the rhapsodic aria, \\"Oh, that I had wings like a dove\\". After the first tenor solo section, the chorus responds with a brief, gentle passage, but the tenor reacts vehemently, indicting those sinners who plot the downfall of innocents. This provokes a wordless female choral lamentation, and their cries joined by the tenor's part propel the work to the climactic choral assertion that \\"God shall hear, and afflict them\\". A dramatic monologue sung by the tenor ensues, continuing nearly to the movement's finale, when the chorus erupts. The second movement follows attacca without pause, in a contrasting pensive mood, featuring extended solos for clarinet and violin, over a shimmering undercurrent of harp and pizzicato strings. The tenor returns with a lyrical, yearning aria, \\"But reassure my heart\\", which combines fervor and tenderness. The final movement primarily features the entire chorus, alternating sounds of martial bombast with words of defiance. The work ends with a hushed prayer. Although Kod√°ly never literally quotes Hungarian folk songs in Psalmus, he integrates folklike pentatonic motifs with plagal cadences that combine to make this music an intense national experience for generations of Hungarians.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809617,00.html One of Kod√°ly's genuine masterworks, Psalmus Hungaricus has rarely been performed or recorded outside of Hungary.

Flora Amussen was the daughter of jeweler Carl Christian Amussen and his wife, Barbara McIsaac Smith. Flora was born in Logan, Utah. Her father died when she was only 15 months old, however he was able to leave a good legacy and so she was raised in relative comfort. She attended elementary school in California and Utah, and graduated from Brigham Young College. Amussen attended Utah State Agricultural College, now Utah State University, where she met Benson. At Utah State, she was a tennis player, winning the colleges women's singles title. She also served as student body vice president and president of the Women's Athletic Club on campus.biographical article on Benson She served as a missionary for the LDS Church in Hawaii. As part of her mission, she taught in the LDS Church-run elementary school in Laie, Hawaii. Her mother was later called on a mission to Hawaii and they served as companions in Honolulu. After her return from her mission, Flora dated Benson again and they were engaged within two months of her return. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple by Orson F. Whitney who had been Ezra's mission president. At the time of their marriage Flora gave up control of many stocks and bonds to her mother so that she and Ezra would earn all their money together. Immediately after their marriage the Bensons traveled to Iowa in a Model-T, camping along the way. In Ames, Iowa Benson studies home economics at Iowa State University while her husband worked on his master's degree. After that the Bensons returned to Ezra's home town of Whitney, Idaho where they ran a farm. While her husband was Secretary of Agriculture, Flora on one occasion declined an invitation to the White House so that she could attend a choir performance by one of her daughters. On occasion she would host Mrs. Eisenhower and the wives of cabinet members in her home. She would do so with only her daughters helping to prepare the meal, never hiring outside help. She also attended all press conferences and congressional hearing where her husband spoke. Benson served with her husband in Europe during the 1960s, when he was president of the European Mission, based out of Frankfurt, Germany. In the LDS Church, she also served in a ward Relief Society presidency, as what would now be called ward Young Women president, as a member of a stake Young Women board, and as a teacher in both the Primary and Sunday School organizations.

Fyodor Ivanovich Lidval (, Swedish:Johan Fredrik Lidvall) (June 1 (June 13) 1870, St. Petersburg ‚Äì 1945, Stockholm) was a Russian-Swedish architect. Life Lidvall was born in St. Petersburg into a family of Swedes. In 1882 he attended elementary school at the Swedish Church of St. Catherine, and then the second Petersburg Technical High School in 1888. For two years he worked in Baron Stieglitz's School of Technical Drawing. From 1890 to 1896 Lidvall was a student in the architectural department of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, studying (1894‚Äì1896) in the workshop of the eminent architect Leon Benois. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in 1896 with the title \\"Artist-Architect\\". From 1909 he was a member of the Academy of Architecture, an arm of the Imperial Academy of Arts. In 1917, ruined by the revolution, he was forced to emigrate to his family in Stockholm, ending the most fruitful period of his work which is connected with St. Petersburg, although he designed several buildings in Stockholm . In Stockholm, Lidvall worked as an architect. He mainly constructed apartment buildings, but also the head office for Shell in Stockholm. He died in 1945 and is buried in Stockholm in Djursholm Cemetery. Works Lidvall began to play a significant role in the architecture of St. Petersburg in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. At the beginning of his career, he was a typical follower of the prevailing Modernist style. One of his early works was an apartment building of the type called in Russia a \\"finance house\\", on Kamennoostrov Prospect in St Petersburg, begun in 1899 and completed in 1904. The structure was also known as the \\"Lidval House\\" as he received the commission from his mother, Ida Amalia Lidval. This building, with its Gothic windows, abundance of decorative elements, and different colors and textures, is often cited as a model of its style. Lidvall himself lived in this house until his exile in 1918. He designed the Azov-Don Commercial Bank Building in St. Petersburg (1907‚Äì1813), already showing his characteristic restraint and use of classical elements (the center of the building includes a portico with columns). Lidvall also built structures for the Azov-Don Commercial Bank in Moscow, Astrakhan, Kiev, and Kharkiv. The second decade of the Twentieth Century began Lidval's creative heyday. During these years he designed a house for Alfred Nobel, the Tolstoy House on Trinity Street (now St. Rubenstein Street) with another facade overlooking the Fontanka Embankment, and many other buildings. Included among these was the six-storey Hotel Astoria, which opened in 1912 and was one of the most luxurious hotels in the Russian Empire.William C Brumfield. Landmarks of Russian Architecture. Routledge (UK), 1997. . pp. 217‚Äì218. He designed (with his mentor Leon Benois) the Art Nouveau redesign of the Grand Hotel Europe, which had been opened in 1875. Both the Hotel Astoria and Grand Hotel Europe are open to this day as five-star hotels.

The theory of micro-mechanics of failure aims to explain the failure of continuous fiber reinforced composites by micro-scale analysis of stresses within each constituent material (such as fiber and matrix), and of the stresses at the interfaces between those constituents, calculated from the macro stresses at the ply level. As a completely mechanics-based failure theory, the theory is expected to provide more accurate analyses than those obtained with phenomenological models such as Tsai-Wu and Hashin failure criteria, being able to distinguish the critical constituent in the critical ply in a composite laminate. Failure envelopes generated by MMF and the Tsai- Wu failure criterion for a carbon/epoxy UD ply, with test data superimposed. Failed constituent envelopes are predicted by MMF but not by Tsai-Wu. Basic concepts The basic concept of the micro-mechanics of failure (MMF) theory is to perform a hierarchy of micromechanical analyses, starting from mechanical behavior of constituents (the fiber, the matrix, and the interface), then going on to the mechanical behavior of a ply, of a laminate, and eventually of an entire structure. At the constituent level, three elements are required to fully characterize each constituent: * The constitutive relation, which describes the transient, or time-independent, response of the constituent to external mechanical as well as hygrothermal loadings; * The master curve, which describes the time-dependent behavior of the constituent under creep or fatigue loadings; * The failure criterion, which describes conditions that cause failure of the constituent. The constituents and a unidirectional lamina are linked via a proper micromechanical model, so that ply properties can be derived from constituent properties, and on the other hand, micro stresses at the constituent level can be calculated from macro stresses at the ply level.  Unit cell model  Schematic illustration of idealized fiber arrays and their corresponding unit cells. Starting from the constituent level, it is necessary to devise a proper method to organize all three constituents such that the microstructure of a UD lamina is well-described. In reality, all fibers in a UD ply are aligned longitudinally; however, in the cross-sectional view, the distribution of fibers is random, and there is no distinguishable regular pattern in which fibers are arrayed. To avoid such a complication cause by the random arrangement of fibers, an idealization of the fiber arrangement in a UD lamina is performed, and the result is the regular fiber packing pattern. Two regular fiber packing patterns are considered: the square array and the hexagonal array. Either array can be viewed as a repetition of a single element, named unit cell or representative volume element (RVE), which consists of all three constituents. With periodical boundary conditions applied, a unit cell is able to respond to external loadings in the same way that the whole array does. Therefore, a unit cell model is sufficient in representing the microstructure of a UD ply.  Stress amplification factor (SAF)  Stress distribution at the laminate level due to external loadings applied to the structure can be acquired using finite element analysis (FEA). Stresses at the ply level can be obtained through transformation of laminate stresses from laminate coordinate system to ply coordinate system. To further calculate micro stresses at the constituent level, the unit cell model is employed. Micro stresses \\\\sigma at any point within fiber/matrix, and micro surface tractions t at any interfacial point, are related to ply stresses \\\\bar{\\\\sigma} as well as temperature increment \\\\Delta T through: : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{f}}&=&M;_{\\\\mathrm{f}}\\\\bar{\\\\sigma} + A_{\\\\mathrm{f}}\\\\Delta T\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{m}}&=&M;_{\\\\mathrm{m}}\\\\bar{\\\\sigma} + A_{\\\\mathrm{m}}\\\\Delta T\\\\\\\\\\\\ t_{\\\\mathrm{i}}&=&M;_{\\\\mathrm{i}}\\\\bar{\\\\sigma} + A_{\\\\mathrm{i}}\\\\Delta T \\\\end{array} Here \\\\sigma, \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}, and t are column vectors with 6, 6, and 3 components, respectively. Subscripts serve as indications of constituents, i.e. {\\\\mathrm{f}} for fiber, {\\\\mathrm{m}} for matrix, and {\\\\mathrm{i}} for interface. M and A are respectively called stress amplification factors (SAF) for macro stresses and for temperature increment. The SAF serves as a conversion factor between macro stresses at the ply level and micro stresses at the constituent level. For a micro point in fiber or matrix, M is a 6√ó6 matrix while A has the dimension of 6√ó1; for an interfacial point, respective dimensions of M and A are 3√ó6 and 3√ó1. The value of each single term in the SAF for a micro material point is determined through FEA of the unit cell model under given macroscopic loading conditions. The definition of SAF is valid not only for constituents having linear elastic behavior and constant coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), but also for those possessing complex constitutive relations and variable CTEs.  Constituent failure criteria  = Fiber failure criterion = Fiber is taken as transversely isotropic, and there are two alternative failure criteria for it: a simple maximum stress criterion and a quadratic failure criterion extended from Tsai-Wu failure criterion: : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\text{Maximum stress failure criterion:}-X^\\\\prime_{\\\\mathrm{f}} < \\\\sigma_1 < X_{\\\\mathrm{f}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Quadratic failure criterion: }\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^6\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^6 F_{ij}\\\\sigma_i\\\\sigma_j + \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^6 F_i\\\\sigma_i = 1 \\\\end{array} The Coefficients involved in the quadratic failure criterion are defined as follows: : F_{11} = \\\\cfrac{1}{X_{\\\\mathrm{f}}X^\\\\prime_{\\\\mathrm{f}}}\\\\ ,\\\\ F_{22} = F_{33} = \\\\cfrac{1}{Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}Y^\\\\prime_{\\\\mathrm{f}}} : F_{44} = \\\\cfrac{1}{S_{\\\\mathrm{f}4}^2}\\\\ ,\\\\ F_{55} = F_{66} = \\\\cfrac{1}{S_{\\\\mathrm{f}6}^2} : F_{1} = \\\\cfrac{1}{X_{\\\\mathrm{f}}} - \\\\cfrac{1}{X_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime}\\\\ ,\\\\ F_{2} = F_{3} = \\\\cfrac{1}{Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}} - \\\\cfrac{1}{Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime} : F_{12} = F_{21} = F_{13} = F_{31} = -\\\\cfrac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{X_{\\\\mathrm{f}} {X}_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime}}\\\\ ,\\\\ F_{23} = F_{32} = -\\\\cfrac{1}{2Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime} where X_{\\\\mathrm{f}}, X_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime, Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}, Y_{\\\\mathrm{f}}^\\\\prime, S_{\\\\mathrm{f}4}, and S_{\\\\mathrm{f}6} denote longitudinal tensile, longitudinal compressive, transverse tensile, transverse compressive, transverse (or through-thickness) shear, and in-plane shear strength of the fiber, respectively. Stresses used in two preceding criteria should be micro stresses in the fiber, expressed in such a coordinate system that 1-direction signifies the longitudinal direction of fiber. = Matrix failure criterion = The polymeric matrix is assumed to be isotropic and exhibits a higher strength under uniaxial compression than under uniaxial tension. A modified version of von Mises failure criterion suggested by Christensen is adopted for the matrix: : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\cfrac{\\\\sigma_{Mises}^2}{C_{\\\\mathrm{m}}T_{\\\\mathrm{m}}} + \\\\left(\\\\cfrac{1}{T_{\\\\mathrm{m}}} - \\\\cfrac{1}{C_{\\\\mathrm{m}}}\\\\right)I_1 = 1 \\\\end{array} Here {T}_{\\\\mathrm{m}} and {C}_{\\\\mathrm{m}} represent matrix tensile and compressive strength, respectively; whereas \\\\sigma_{Mises} and {\\\\mathrm{I}}_1 are von Mises equivalent stress and the first stress invariant of micro stresses at a point within matrix, respectively. = Interface failure criterion = The fiber-matrix interface features traction-separation behavior, and the failure criterion dedicated to it takes the following form: \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\left\\\\langle{t}_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle}{{Y}_{n}}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\cfrac{{t}_{s}}{{Y}_{s}}\\\\right)^2 = 1 \\\\end{array} where {t}_{n} and {t}_{s} are normal (perpendicular to the interface) and shear (tangential to the interface) interfacial tractions, with {Y}_{n} and {Y}_{s} being their corresponding strengths. The angle brackets (Macaulay brackets) imply that a pure compressive normal traction does not contribute to interface failure.  Further extension of MMF  = Hashin‚Äôs Failure Criteria = These are interacting failure criteria where more than one stress components have been used to evaluate the different failure modes. These criteria were originally developed for unidirectional polymeric composites, and hence, applications to other type of laminates and non-polymeric composites have significant approximations. Usually Hashin criteria are implemented within two-dimensional classical lamination approach for point stress calculations with ply discounting as the material degradation model. Failure indices for Hashin criteria are related to fibre and matrix failures and involve four failure modes. The criteria are extended to three-dimensional problems where the maximum stress criteria are used for transverse normal stress component. The failure modes included in Hashin‚Äôs criteria are as follows. # Tensile fibre failure for œÉ11 ‚â• 0 # Compressive fibre failure for œÉ11 < 0 # Tensile matrix failure for œÉ22 + œÉ33 > 0 # Compressive matrix failure for œÉ22 + œÉ33 < 0 # Interlaminar tensile failure for œÉ33 > 0 # Interlaminar compression failure for œÉ33 < 0 where, œÉij denote the stress components and the tensile and compressive allowable strengths for lamina are denoted by subscripts T and C, respectively. XT, YT, ZT denotes the allowable tensile strengths in three respective material directions. Similarly, XC, YC, ZC denotes the allowable compressive strengths in three respective material directions. Further, S12, S13 and S23 denote allowable shear strengths in the respective principal material directions. Endeavors have been made to incorporate MMF with multiple progressive damage models and fatigue models for strength and life prediction of composite structures subjected to static or dynamic loadings.

Karl Amussen, the third son of Danish sea captain Karl Asmussen and his wife Petra Asmussen n√©e Johansen, was born in K√∏ge, Zealand just outside Copenhagen, Denmark on May 20, 1825. Not wishing to follow in his ancestor's footsteps, Amussen apprenticed as a watchmaker, jeweler and dentist. His skill in jewelry-making was so great that he spent some time as court jeweler to the Czar of Russia. Additionally he was involved in that trade in Great Britain, Russia and Australia and circumnavigated the globe twice over the course of his lifetime. In 1857 Amussen moved to Christchurch, New Zealand where he opened a jewelry store.Nobel Warrum, Charles W. Morse, W. Brown Ewing. Utah Since Statehood, Historical and Biographical, p. 697. It was there in 1864 he learned of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from reading Parley P. Pratt's pamphlet The Voice of Warning. The stamp on the booklet noted that it had been published in Liverpool, England and so he traveled there to the headquarters of the church. Amussen was baptized into the LDS Church by Elisha H. Groves and in 1865 moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. Amussen was then called to serve a mission in New Zealand where he organized an LDS congregation in Kaipoi.Deseret News Church Almanac, 2010 Edition, p. 540. In 1868 Amussen returned to Salt Lake City where he met Brigham Young and, upon Young's advice, purchased land on Main Street where he built a jewelry store. He brought supplies via covered wagon and the mirrors that once adorned his store were later used in the Salt Lake Temple.. The Amussen Building, designed by pioneer architect William Harrison Folsom, was the first fire-proof building in the Utah Territory. It was constructed of sandstone with a slate roof, cement basement and pane glass windows. The two-story store towered over the surrounding one-story adobe structures and remains standing to this day as a testament to its sound construction. Amussen was also connected with the early American department store, Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution and the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. Amussen served two missions for the LDS Church in Denmark and also later served a mission in Australia. He was ordained a Seventy by Joseph Young. After Amussen retired from the jewelry business he invested in real estate in Logan, Utah and owned business properties in the center of Logan. He was a polygamist with three wives: Anna K. Nielsen, and sisters Martha McIsaac Smith and Barbara McIssac Smith. Amussen had 18 children by his three wives. His youngest child, Flora Amussen, born in 1901, married LDS Church president Ezra Taft Benson. For the last several years of his life Amussen resided in Logan, where his son Carl S. Amussen was later a prominent car dealer in the 1910s. Notes References *Sheri L. Dew. Ezra Taft Benson: A Biography. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1987) p. 67-69. * *Noble Warrum, Charles W.

It was created to serve troubled high school juniors, seniors and dropouts within Toledo's school district that may have had physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral issues. History Created in 1970, the Jefferson Center moved into the old U.S. Post Office building at 1300 Jefferson Avenue in 1972. The school hoped to be a trendsetter nationally and aimed at TPS students that had issues with their home schools. Instead of having principals, teachers, students, and a separate set of rules for adults and children, the school was set up with the titles of director, supervisors, evaluators, and trainees. After much renovation to equip the building for instruction, the school was able to provide programs in building maintenance, child care, fabric service, food service, health care, manufacturing and construction, merchandising, office services, and warehousing. Despite its intentions to serve troubled teens, the Jefferson Center still had problems with attendance and graduation rates throughout its history. After a short debate on whether it was living up to its original expectations, the school was spared from closure in 1989 along with Macomber- Whitney High School. The Jefferson Center remained open until June 2000 when TPS decided to save $15.2 million by cutting the alternative school, along with Old Orchard Junior High and 67 teaching jobs. The Head Start program moved into the building the following year. In April 2011, TPS considered demolishing the building unless an alternative use for it could be found. A majority of the school board has voiced opinion in favor of keeping the historic 1911 building standing. In March 2019, the Toledo Board of Education sold the building to ProMedica Health Systems for $1.2 million.

The film is a remake of the 1937 Norwegian film To levende og en d√∏d, which in turn was adapted from the novel of the same name by author Sigurd Christiansen. The Scandinavian small-town setting of the earlier film was kept but the action was moved to Sweden. Plot Erik Berger (McGoohan) is a reticent, socially withdrawn man who has been working for 20 years in the same Post Office in a Swedish town, not socializing with colleagues and interested only in his wife Helen (McKenna) and son. In contrast his workmate Andersson (Travers) is loud and gregarious, seeing himself as the office joker although his treatment of more junior staff sometimes verges on the malicious. A violent hold-up - heard, but not shown on screen - takes place, during which the office supervisor is shot dead and Andersson suffers a head injury which knocks him out and leaves him concussed. Berger meanwhile, entering the office after hearing the commotion and thinking of his family, resists the urge to risk his life by trying to fight back against the raiders, and emerges uninjured from the incident. In the aftermath, he is treated with barely disguised contempt by the police, his employers and the local community in general, who make it clear that they consider his failure to fight back a mark of spineless cowardice. He does not receive the promotion to office supervisor which he was previously in line for on the retirement of his boss; instead the job is given to Andersson, who is now being cast in a heroic light. As he becomes increasingly depressed by his ostracism, his relationship with Helen suffers and he feels unable to confide in her. He comes to see himself as the coward everybody is accusing him of being, and even Helen begins to wonder whether he could have acted differently. Berger takes to solitary nocturnal wandering around the town, and meets a stranger, Rogers (Alf Kjellin), to whom he begins to open up about his recent experiences, albeit while pretending that he is a \\"friend\\" of the man involved. Berger and Rogers begin to meet up frequently on their night-time wanderings, and one night, as they part company outside Berger's home, Helen unexpectedly opens the door and invites Rogers in for supper. As they talk, she realizes that her husband has chosen to confide in a stranger rather than her and feels hurt and betrayed. In her distress, she reveals to Berger that their son too is being shunned by his schoolmates and taunted by the allegation that his father is a coward, but has been trying to keep this from Berger, not wanting to add to his unhappiness. The Bergers' relationship deteriorates to the point where they are completely alienated from one another. Seeing this, Rogers eventually admits to Berger that he and his brother were the Post Office robbers, and his brother has since been killed in an accident. Moreover, he lives in the same lodging-house as Andersson, and the robbery was only planned as a consequence of Andersson's constant chatter about the large amount of cash held in the office and when it was most readily accessible. He states that he certainly would have shot Berger had he fought back, but now genuinely regrets the turmoil he has caused to his life, and goes on to reveal that Andersson's injury was not a result of fearless bravery, but happened rather when he ran into a doorframe in his panic to escape. Appalled to discover Andersson's hypocrisy and the craven manner in which he has glorified in his unwarranted heroic status, Berger borrows Rogers' gun and stages another incident in which he exposes Andersson for the man of straw he really is. Having exorcised his demons he returns home to Helen feeling vindicated, and she realizes that their relationship can get back on an even keel.

The first fully capable military submarine, she was launched 8 September 1888. She had one torpedo tube (and two torpedoes) and an air regeneration system. Her hull shape, propeller, periscope, torpedo launcher and cruciform external controls anticipated later designs. Her underwater speed was . With fully charged batteries, she was the fastest submarine yet built, with underwater performance levels (except for range) that matched those of First World War U-boats for a very short period, before her batteries began to drain. For example, the , a pre-war German U-boat built in 1908, had an underwater speed of 8.1kn, and an underwater range of at 5.8kn, before having to resurface to recharge her batteries. Although advanced in many ways, Peral lacked a means of charging batteries while underway, such as an internal combustion engine, thus had a very limited endurance and range. In June 1890, Peral's submarine launched a torpedo while submerged. It was also the first submarine to incorporate a fully reliable underwater navigation system. However, conservatives in the Spanish naval hierarchy terminated the project despite two years of successful tests. Her operational abilities have led some to call her the first U-boat. Peral was withdrawn from service in 1890 and is now preserved at the Cartagena Naval Museum. Conception Profile of the Peral. Peral was first conceived on 20 September 1884, when Lieutenant Isaac Peral y Caballero wrote a paper which would become his ' (\\"Project for a submarine torpedo boat\\"). After several studies and experiments, and having gained support from his superiors and fellow officers, Peral exposed his idea to the Spanish navy staff. He wrote a letter to the Spanish naval minister, Vice Admiral Pezuela y Lobo, in September, 1885. Pezuela called Peral to Madrid to have a personal interview with him. After the interview Pezuela agreed to finance Peral's preliminary studies in C√°diz with an initial budget of 5,000 pesetas, before launching a program to build a full-scale submarine. The first study consisted of human breath test in an enclosure for several hours. A room of square meters was used, with an air storage cell, loaded to 79 atmospheres and a storage capacity of 0.5 m3. In addition to instruments to measure the temperature and moisture, there was a tube to re-oxygenate the air supply to the crew through a waterproof cloak and three water buckets to maintain the moisture. Six people locked themselves inside the room; one had to leave an hour and quarter later, but the rest remained for a total of five hours, and the test was considered a total success. On 21 July 1886, the new Navy Minister, rear-admiral Beranger, decided that the project would be reviewed by the Centro T√©cnico de la Armada (Naval Technical Center), under the responsibility of Admiral Antequera. He considered a more complete study of the actuator necessary before undertaking the construction of the hull and the electric engine. He authorized Peral to carry out all the modifications that he thought worthwhile, granting him 25,000 pesetas. On 5 March 1887, Peral communicated that the electric motor or \\"depth's device\\", as he called it, was ready. On 17 March, the Commander in Chief of Cadiz, Florencio Montojo, who headed the technical committee overseeing the machine, requested budgeting for Peral's submarine. =Construction= Turret detail On 25 April 1887, the submarine's construction was finally approved by the government; the keel was laid down on La Carraca on 7 October, although work did not start until two weeks later. Nevertheless, the submarine had already undergone a number of modifications: Peral's original 1885 model conceived of a 61-ton submarine, long, with a beam of and a single electric motor for a single shaft. The submarine Peral began in 1887 had a length of more than , a beam of , a draft of , two electric motors geared to twin screws, and a displacement of 77 tons surfaced and 85 submerged. Air regeneration in the interior of the submarine was accomplished by an auxiliary engine, which passed the air through a sodium hydroxide purifier to eliminate CO2 exhaled by the crew. In addition, the pump injected oxygen when needed. The same engine which circulated air also drove the bailing pump. The submarine dived by means of the \\"depth's device\\" which drove two shafts of vertical axes located at both ends of the hull, moved by two electrical motors to submerge or surface, and to maintain horizontal stability submerged. The ballast tanks had a storage capacity of 8 tons, and were used to stabilize the submarine. In order to navigate, Peral used a bronze magnetic needle installed in the ceiling of the turret. The design avoided any electrical interference. He also devised a periscope, a fixed tube on the turret; by using a series of prisms, it projected the outside world to within the submarine. The engine-cooling system consisted of forcing compressed air stored in the submarine over the engines, and though the original project had needed 430 accumulators, the final project installed 613 with a weight of . The total weight of the batteries was around 30 tons. The top speed varied with the charge of the batteries. With one-quarter charge, the submarine was able to reach , one-half , three-quarters , knots, completely charged . The range of the boat again depended on battery charge level; Peral calculated his original submarine could reach at a speed of . With no means of charging batteries while underway, such as an internal combustion engine, endurance and range were limited. One of the original features of Peral was an underwater lamp, which enabled the crew to search the sea bottom. The searchlight had a range of . The submarine was single-hulled, and the ballast tanks were located at the bottom of the hull, underneath the torpedo tube. This single torpedo tube was the only weapon in the submarine, with two watertight doors on each end so the submarine could launch a torpedo submerged. Mechanisms used for reloading were simple and fast, and the submarine had three reserves. This was almost identical to the torpedo launchers used in submarines since then. In order to avoid expenses, the torpedoes Peral launched during the trials were borrowed from torpedo boats, two from Retamosa and one from Barcel√≥. =Trials= The Peral Submarine in 2009 in front of the port of Cartagena. The Peral was launched on 8 September 1888, sixteen days before another pioneering electric submarine, the French Gymnote. On 6 March 1889 the Perals trials started, consisting of handling and surface navigation. On 7 August that year, the submarine submerged for the first time up to the turret; 18 days later fired the first trial torpedo (without warhead); on 5 December submerged to 7.5 m; on 25 December passed the first non-static dive test, sailing at a steady depth of 9.5 meters; and, in 1890 sailed underwater for one hour, reaching a maximum depth of 30 meters in trials. On 25 June that year the Peral made two simulated engagements on the cruiser Col√≥n, one at day and other at night. At the daylight trial the submarine was unable to attack the cruiser, as the optical turret was spotted less than away from the cruiser, which had 200 civilian and military guests who obviously expected to see the submarine, a fact that angered Isaac Peral. The simulated night attack was successful. The staff that evaluated the trials of the submarine submitted a report, considering its speed and range insufficient, and being especially critical about the failure of the submarine during the daylight attack and its electric motors. However, overall the report was positive, and a second submarine was ordered, again under the direction of Isaac Peral but also managed by several naval departments. Peral designed a 30-meter submarine of 130 tons, under the condition of choosing the yard where the submarine would be built and the choosing the team to build it. These conditions were not accepted by the authorities, who considered this a refusal by Peral to build the submarine. Finally they ordered Peral to return the submarine to the La Carraca yard where it was built. On 11 November 1890 a decree set the end of the projects of underwater navigation in the Spanish navy. Similar figures of performance were only attained about a decade later in other countries. The speed and endurance of the Peral attained World War I standards (in terms of underwater, battery-powered sailing). =Preservation= The Peral Submarine in 2013 in the new Naval Museum of Cartagena. In 1890 Peral was withdrawn from service, equipment removed, and the hull stored at La Carraca Arsenal. In 1913 her demolition was ordered but this was not carried out. In 1929, Admiral Mateo Garc√≠a de los Reyes, first commander of the Spanish submarine forces, managed to reclaim the hull and towed it to Cartagena, putting it ashore at the submarine base. In 1965 the authorities of Cartagena succeeded in moving the hull to the Plaza de los H√©roes de Cavite. In 2002 was moved to the Paseo Alfonso XII, in front of the port of Cartagena. In 2013, Peral was restored and moved to the Cartagena Naval Museum. See also * Submarine * History of submarines Notes References  * * Villan√∫a, Le√≥n, 1934, Isaac Peral.

From January 1916 to November 1918 he served as finance minister of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. He was elected a member of the Weimar National Assembly in 1919. He continued to serve as a delegate in the Reichstag until 1930. In 1922/1923 he was Minister of Economics, under Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno, during the onset of hyperinflation. Life and career Johann Baptist (also: Johannes) Becker was born on 3 February 1869 at Ludwigsh√∂he in the Grand Duchy of Hesse (present-day Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany). His father, Franz Becker, was a builder and winemaker from a peasant family. His mother was Elisabetha, n√©e Schaad. Becker married Johanna Caroline Hartmann on 4 September 1895 at Gie√üen. They had one daughter. He studied at Gie√üen, Leipzig, Munich and Berlin. He then joined the civil service of the Grand Duchy of Hesse where he advanced rapidly. From January 1916 to November 1918, he was the Hessian minister of finance. His achievements in Hesse included the reform of the tax system (1899) which eliminated the Realsteuern and brought the system into line with that of Prussia. He also was the main inspiration behind the reform of the Hessian communal tax system (1911). In addition, Becker was very interested in the set-up and running of the railway system. In 1919, he was elected to the Weimar National Assembly, the new republic's constituent assembly. From 1920 to 1930, Becker was a member of the Reichstag for the German People's Party (DVP). He was also member of the board of directors of the Rheinische Stahlwerke Duisburg-Meiderich. On the suggestion of Gustav Stresemann and Rudolf Heinze, Becker was made Reichswirtschaftsminister (minister of economics) when the cabinet of Wilhelm Cuno was formed in November 1922. Due to his connections with Rhenish industry he was attacked by the parties of the left but did not exert any influence to further the interest of heavy industry whilst in office. After the Occupation of the Ruhr, he remained a supporter of \\"passive resistance\\" against the French and Belgian occupation forces until the end, even as it caused the German economy to spiral downward and inflation to accelerate. He prepared the stabilization of the currency that came with the introduction of the Rentenmark in October 1923. However, the cabinet resigned in August and Becker was not in office any more when that reform actually took place. He died on 17 October 1951 at Ludwigsh√∂he.

It is recognized as the first public school in the Territory of Michigan when it was founded in 1828. The school district closed in 1946, and the building has served as Raisinville Township Hall since 1982. The Bridge School was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site on December 17, 1987. Description The first structure known as the Bridge School was constructed in 1828 and rebuilt in 1832. It was a simple log cabin schoolhouse built using wood from walnut trees. The log cabin was replaced with the current brick structure in 1868. The structure is a one- story, end-gable, solid red-brick, vernacular building with a tin roof. It sits atop a limestone foundation. The schoolhouse originally contained two rooms. In 1910, a significantly large addition was added to the brick structure using the same architectural designs. Early history The passage of the first public school law by the Legislative Council of the Michigan Territory on April 12, 1827 made education a municipal responsibility and required local governments to organize their own school systems. Soon after, the Bridge School opened on April 17, 1828 as the first public school building in the Michigan Territory. The Bridge School was not the first educational facility built in the territory, as numerous private and religious institutions predated 1828, as did the University of Michigan, which was established 10 years earlier in Detroit. At the time, the Michigan Territory only had two formally organized counties: Monroe County and Wayne County.List of Michigan counties with creation date Monroe County, where the Bridge School was located, only had a population of 336 at the 1820 census. The new district would receive taxpayer funding from the government of the Michigan Territory and is recognized as the first district of its kind in the territory that later became the state of Michigan in 1837. The Bridge School was centrally located within Monroe County, and its name came from the recently- constructed Bruckner Bridge near the River Raisin about 500 feet (152 meters) north of the schoolhouse. It was built on land deeded by George Sorter. The log structure was again replaced by a two-room brick schoolhouse in 1868. Several more rooms were built in a large addition to the brick structure in 1910. On the centennial anniversary of the Bridge School in 1928, an obelisk was erected in front of the building. The obelisk was constructed with stones that current students and past alumni brought for the celebration. The obelisk, which still stands in its original spot, reads: Recent history The Bridge School served as a functioning educational facility for 118 years from 1828‚Äì1946. The building ceased operation as an educational facility in 1946 and was completely shuttered in 1950. When the school closed, students were absorbed into Dundee Community Schools in neighboring Dundee Township. Dundee Community Schools took ownership of the now-defunct Bridge School, but the structure remained vacant. Shortly after in 1956, the board of education for Dundee Community Schools donated the unused building to the Monroe County Historical Society. The property was later deeded to Raisinville Township in 1980. The township renovated the structure and converted it into their township hall in 1982, and it served as a polling place for the first time that year as well. The Bridge School was recognized as a Michigan State Historic Site on December 17, 1987. A local historic marker detailing the school's history was erected by the Monroe County Historical Society. The structure continues to serve as the township hall for Raisinville Township. The hall is located at 96 Ida Maybee Road just north of M-50 (South Custer Road). Ida Maybee Road was once designated as part of M-130 when it was a state highway from 1929‚Äì1955.

Danziger Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities is an annual honorary bestowed upon an ‚Äúestablished scholar of classical literature, who has made substantial contributions to the critical analysis of classical literature, or has been exceptionally skilled at inspiring an appreciation for classical literature‚Äù by the Humanities Division of the University of Chicago. Sigmund H Danziger Jr. (1916-1979) founded Homak Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1947 in Chicago. A Chicago southsider and son of a sales representative for houseware products, including bathroom scales, Mr. Danziger began his business career ‚Äújobbing‚Äù for Chicago manufacturers while a student at the University of Chicago (graduated 1937). After the World War II, in which he served as a captain and translator, he purchased a bathroom cabinet manufacturer on the south side of Chicago for which he was jobbing. Naming the new company Homak, capturing a sign he noted on a hat store, he began manufacturing steel kitchen cabinets and rapidly moved to a building, which he designed at 4433 S. Springfield Ave in Chicago. In the early 1960s, an order for tool boxes lead to the production of a hardware line including roller cabinets, tool boxes, and other accessories. Through the 1970s and 1980s, most of the major retailers and chains of the time became either line or private label customers at one time or another, including Sears, Walmart, Kmart, Lowe's, The Home Depot True Value, Ace Hardware, Montgomery Ward, Coast-to-Coast, Costco, Meijer, Pep Boys, Fingerhut, NAPA, etc. In 1979, Sigmund Danziger died and his wife Gertrude (Trudy), who was known as \\"The Toolbox Lady\\" in the hardware industry, ran the company for the next 25 years. During this time, the company moved to a facility in Bedford Park, Illinois at 5151 W 73rd St. while sales grew to over $100,000,000 with hardware, automotive, hospital (under Homed TM), and sporting goods lines. One of the major innovations during this period was the introduction of a consumer gun cabinet (under HomSafe TM), which instantly grew to be a major hit at mass retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Mountain, Dick's Sporting Goods and Sports Authority. Also a line of garage cabinets was introduced for Whirlpool and Sears under the label \\"Gladiator Garageworks.\\" Homak employed hundreds of people, who enjoyed the prosperity of the industry, and was the largest privately held sheet-metal fabricator in America.

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) represents the Urdu-speaking Muhajir and is a political rival of the Pashtuns who have migrated to the city from northwest Pakistan. Haider, a Shia Muslim, was killed as he attended a funeral at a mosque. By August 6 at least 10 Pashtuns were killed and more than 100 people injured in widespread violence that engulfed the city. Economic losses over two days of riots were estimated to be about Pakistani rupees (approximately 200 million USD). Background Karachi has a history of political bloodshed stretching back to the late 1980s when the city was regularly rocked by political and ethnic shootings that killed dozens every week. Analysts said the city was again in the grip of a political turf war. Karachi, which is provincial capital of Sindh and Pakistan's commercial capital and largest city, has a population of and contributes about 70% of the country's tax income. The city has seen a wave of political killings in 2010 which have deepened ethnic tensions. Violence Most of those killed and injured in the reprisal shootings came from the smaller Pashtuns. The MQM, which ruled Karachi until earlier 2010, represents the city's Muhajir community. Most of the injured were Pashtuns, with a few Sindhis and Punjabis among the victims, said one source. Jan Sardar, a 35-year-old Pashtun, was shot seven times. \\"When they fired the first shot, I jumped in a sewer to save myself, but they came after me and fired more bullets,\\" he said from his hospital bed. The gunman was carrying an MQM flag, he added. Clothes trader Ahmed Shah, who was shot in the leg, was travelling in a bus with 50 passengers when it came under fire. \\"I didn't see who it was; it was dark,\\" he said. A cousin said he saw seven dead bodies at the site. Iqbal Hussain, a teenager from Swat, said he was left for dead after a gunman burst into his house in north Karachi, opening fire. A less fortunate friend was killed. Several buildings were set on fire and vehicles destroyed after angry mobs went through the city streets seeking revenge. Most of those killed were Pashtuns. Most of the injured had been shot point blank and were targeted for their ethnicity. In the neighboring city of Hyderabad gunmen attacked a train going to Lahore, injuring the driver and destroying the locomotive. Reactions MQM declared three days of mourning after the assassination. Business activities in the city virtually shut down. The local police arrested 40 people including 20 Islamist hardliners. Interior minister Rehman Malik blamed Sipah-e-Sahaba of fomenting violence against the minority Shia community in Pakistan. President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, ordered an immediate investigation into the violence. The Karachi Stock Exchange saw very slow activity in the aftermath of the riots and the rupee hit a record low of 85.80 to a United States dollar.

NSLS-II is one of the world's most advanced synchrotron light sources, designed to produce x-rays 10,000 times brighter than BNL's original light source, the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). NSLS-II supports basic and applied research in energy security, advanced materials synthesis and manufacturing, environment, and human health. NSLS-II is a state-of-the-art, medium-energy electron storage ring (3 billion electron-volts). The facility enables the study of material properties and functions with nanoscale resolution and exquisite sensitivity by providing world-leading capabilities for x-ray imaging and high-resolution energy analysis. The facility is open to researchers from academia and industry. NSLS-II fuels major advances in new energy technologies such as nanocatalyst-based fuel cells, economical use of solar energy, high-temperature superconductors in a high capacity and high reliability electric grid, and advanced electrical storage systems for transportation and harnessing intermittent renewable energy sources.Exterior of National Synchrotron Light Source II facility, taken 22 July 2012 during Brookhaven National Laboratory \\"Summer Sundays\\" public tour.  Users and partners  = Users = In 2017, NSLS-II served over 1,000 researchers (\\"users\\") from academic, industrial, and government laboratories worldwide. Any qualified researcher can submit a peer-reviewed proposal to use NSLS-II. = Partners = NSLS-II partners with public and private institutions to fund the construction and operation of some of its beamlines. Its partnerships include BNL's Center for Functional Nanomaterials and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, among many others. NSLS-II is always open for new partnerships.  Beamlines  NSLS-II currently has 22 beamlines (experimental stations) open for user operations. When the facility is complete, NSLS-II will have at least 58 beamlines in operation. The beamlines at NSLS-II are grouped into six programs: hard x-ray spectroscopy, imaging & microscopy, structural biology, soft x-ray scattering & spectroscopy, complex scattering, and diffraction & in situ scattering. These programs group beamlines together that offer similar types of research techniques for studying the behavior and structure of matter. = Hard X-ray spectroscopy = * 6-BM: Materials Measurement (BMM) * 7-ID-1: Spectroscopy Soft and Tender (SST-1) (under construction) * 7-ID-2: Spectroscopy Soft and Tender (SST-2) (under construction) * 7-BM: Quick X-ray Absorption and Scattering (QAS) * 8-ID: Inner Shell Spectroscopy (ISS) * 8-BM: Tender Energy X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (TES) = Imaging and microscopy = * 3-ID: Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) * 4-BM: X-ray Fluorescence Microprobe (XFM) * 5-ID: Submicron Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy (SRX) * 18-ID: Full-Field X-ray Imaging (FXI) (under construction) = Structural biology = * 16-ID: Life Science X-ray Scattering (LIX) * 17-ID-1: Highly Automated Macromolecular Crystallography Beamline (AMX) * 17-ID-2: Frontier Microfocusing Macromolecular Crystallography (FMX) * 17-BM: X-ray Footprinting for Structural Studies of Biological Macromolecules (XFP) * 19-ID: Biological Microdiffraction Facility (NYX) = Soft X-ray scattering and spectroscopy = * 2-ID: Soft Inelastic X-ray Scattering (SIX) * 21-ID: Electron Spectro-Microscopy (ESM) * 22-IR-1: Frontier Synchrotron Infrared Spectroscopy (FIS) (under construction) * 22-IR-2: Magnetospectroscopy, Ellipsomentry and Time-Resolved Optical Spectroscopies (MET) (under construction) * 23-ID-1: Coherent Soft X-ray Scattering (CSX-1) * 23-ID-2: Soft X-ray Spectroscopy and Polarization (CSX-2) = Complex scattering = * 10-ID: Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS) * 11-ID: Coherent Hard X-ray Scattering (CHX) * 11-BM: Complex Materials Scattering (CMS) * 12-ID: Soft Matter Interfaces (SMI) = Diffraction and in-situ scattering = * 4-ID: Integrated In-situ and Resonant Hard X-ray Studies (ISR) * 27-ID: High Energy X-ray Diffraction (HEX) (under construction) * 28-ID-1: Total Scattering Beamline (PDF) (under construction) * 28-ID-2: X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XPD)  Storage ring parameters  NSLS-II is a medium energy (3.0 GeV) electron storage ring designed to deliver photons with high average spectral brightness exceeding 1021 ph/s in the 2 ‚Äì 10 keV energy range and a flux density exceeding 1015 ph/s in all spectral ranges. This performance requires the storage ring to support a very high-current electron beam (up to 500 mA) with a very small horizontal (down to 0.5 nm-rad) and vertical (8 pm-rad) emittance. The electron beam is stable in its position (<10% of its size), angle (<10% of its divergence), dimensions (<10%), and intensity (¬±0.5% variation). = Storage ring lattice = The NSLS-II storage ring lattice consists of 30 double-bend achromat (DBA) cells that can accommodate at least 58 beamlines for user experiments, distributed by type of source as follows: * 15 low-beta ID straights for undulators or superconducting wigglers * 12 high-beta ID straights for either undulators or damping wigglers * 31 BM ports providing broadband sources covering the IR, VUV, and soft x-ray ranges. Any of these ports can alternatively be replaced by a 3PW port covering the hard x-ray range. * 4 BM ports on large gap (90 mm) dipoles for very far-IR = Radiation sources = Continuing the tradition established by the NSLS, NSLS-II radiation sources span a very wide spectral range, from the far infrared (down to 0.1 eV) to the very hard x-ray region (>300 keV). This is achieved by a combination of bending magnets, three-pole wigglers, and insertion device (ID) sources. History Construction of NSLS- II began in 2009 and was completed on-time and under budget in 2014. NSLS-II saw first light in October 2014. The facility cost US$912,000,000 to build, and the project received the DOE's Secretary's Award of Excellence. Torcon Inc., headquartered in New Jersey, was the general contractor selected by the DOE for the project.

Although the school was founded during the Meiji period, it has earlier roots in the Iyo-Matsuyama Domain's Han school, K≈çtokukan, Sh≈´raikan and Meiky≈çkan. Among the first students at the new school was Masaoka Tsunenori, later known as Masaoka Shiki. As Seishi Shinoda and Sanford Goldstein explain, :In the 1870s and 1880s, the democratic movement was at its height, and one of its chief leaders was Taisuke Itagaki (1837-1919) from Kochi Prefecture... The prefectural governor of Ehime and the principal of Shiki's school. Though the principal had to resign in the summer of 1879 because of his radical views, his influence remained strong at Matsuyama Middle School. For some years after his departure, democratic thought reigned at the school; yet after the principal's departure many students left, and their numbers decreased from 213 in 1879 to 102 in 1881. Among those strongly influenced by the former principal was Shiki. He neglected most of his schoolwork, so caught up was he in the excitement of making political speeches night after night with ten or so of his classmates.Masaoka Shiki, Songs from a Bamboo Village: Selected Tanka from Take no Sato Uta, translated by Sanford Goldstein and Seishi Shinoda (Rutland, VA: Charles E. Tuttle Co., 1998), 9. Undoubtedly the most famous teacher at Matsuyama Middle School was Natsume Kinnosuke, better known as Natsume S≈çseki, who arrived in 1895 and taught for only a year, but later memorialized the experience in one of Japan's most popular novels, Botchan (1906). Botchan describes the comically unfortunate experiences of a young teacher fresh from Tokyo (called, euphemistically, \\"Botchan\\" or \\"little master\\") as he attempts, with little enthusiasm or success, to adapt to the academic regime and the local culture. In the novel, Botchan's colleagues are given comical names such as Tanuki (Japanese raccoon dog), Akashatsu (Red-shirt), etc., prompting continued speculation as to which of S≈çseki's fellow teachers might have been their real-life models. The school name was changed to the present one in 1949.

Plot In the prologue, the mother of Sara (Jessica Lowndes) is transporting a family of three (two parents and their son) in a small aircraft. The child is extremely nervous and starts hyperventilating. Wondering why he is so afraid, the parents suddenly see an out-of-control aircraft that crashes into them, and everyone plummets to the ground. Years later, Sara, who has recently received her pilot's license, is planning to fly to a concert with her friends: her boyfriend Bruce Parker (Landon Liboiron), her cousin Cory (Ryan Donowho), her best friend Mel (Julianna Guill) and Mel's boyfriend Sal (Jake Weary). While in the air, Bruce's nerves draw ridicule from the others and Sara invites him to take the controls. They hit some turbulence and Bruce loses control, taking them into a steep climb. Sara tries to regain control, but a loose bolt has jammed the elevator. Only able to climb, they fly into a storm and lose radio contact. Sara explains that with the elevator jammed, they will keep climbing until they run out of fuel or reach the aircraft's ceiling. They have less than an hour's worth of fuel left; Bruce has a panic attack and is put to sleep with a choke hold by Sal. In an effort to save fuel, they jettison everything overboard. The only way to unjam the tail is to climb outside and manually remove the obstacle. Cory, who has experience as a climber, volunteers. He has climbing gear with him and a rope for to use as an anchor. Sal wraps the rope around himself and after some difficulty, Cory makes it to the tail and removes the errant bolt. Sal then sees a horrifyingly giant tentacle among the clouds and loses control of the rope. Cory slips and Sal is almost pulled out of the aircraft. Panicking, he cuts the rope and Cory falls, only to be caught by the monster tentacle. When Bruce awakens, he finds he has been tied up and learns Cory is dead, along with a monster outside. Bruce tells Sara that he was in the crash that killed her mother and his parents. Sara tries the radio again and hears a strange noise. Sal recognizes it as the monster that took Cory. Suddenly, the aircraft crashes into the monster's open mouth. Bruce looks at a page of his comic which shows a blond woman being grabbed by tentacles. Immediately, a large tentacle grabs Mel and kills her. Bruce starts flicking through the comic book, as if he has discovered something. Sal threatens to kill Bruce for causing Mel's death and tries to throw him out, but Sara intervenes and in the ensuing confusion, Sal falls out the door and plummets to his death. Bruce tells Sara he is causing all this; that his mind is recreating the comic book, something that happens when he gets very scared. The creature starts attacking the aircraft, and Sara demands that Bruce prove he is doing it by ending it all. His attempts just make things worse, until Sara kisses him, but is grabbed by the monster. She tells him that if he can do all this, then he can bring his parents back. After a struggle, the monster suddenly disappears and she falls back into the aircraft. As they fly out of the storm, they see another aircraft heading straight for them, carrying Bruce, his parents and Sara's mother. They manage to take control of their aircraft, and don't crash into the other. In the altered past Sara's mother and Bruce's family have arrived at their destination intact. Sara's mother says \\"Everybody gets one near miss, right?\\", and Bruce's mom asks, \\"Do you think they made it?\\" to which Sara's mother replies \\"I hope so.\\" The young Sara and Bruce are introduced to one another, holding hands and looking out into the sky.

Reception Many praised the overall interesting structure, the consistent pace of the movie and the unexpected twist at the end of the movie, with many stating how its originality and thoughtfulness elevated the movie's overall experience and enjoyability. In addition, numerous critics praised how the movie created an abundance of tension through numerous camera and film techniques. Furthermore, another positive of the movie was its interesting film and camera technique and special effects despite its substantially low budget for a horror movie of this scale. They stated that the blending of the computer-generated imagery and the camera shots used in such a tight and cramped location was quite impressive and better than many big budget movies. They also praised the actors ability to naturally move, fight, jump etc. despite the cramped environment they were surrounding in. However, reviewers were quick to fault the badly written script and the lack of characterisation throughout the film, decreasing the overall enjoyability of the movie. One critic wrote that the \\"script seem(ed) hell-bent on dragging (the movie) down\\". Other critics had a serious problem with the first act of the movie, with many stating it was hard to keep watching.

From 1905 to 1907 he led the successful effort to restore the Colorado River to its banks after irrigation canal construction and flooding diverted it from the Gulf of California and into California's Imperial Valley, creating the Salton Sea. Randolph spent his later life in Tucson, Arizona where he served as president of several railroads, as vice-president of Tucson's Consolidated National Bank, and as chancellor of the University of Arizona Board of Regents. Early life Randolph was born in Lunenburg County, Virginia. His parents were also natives of Virginia, his father, William Eston Randolph, having been born in Clarke County, and his mother, Sarah Lavinia Epes, in Lunenburg County. Career =Railroad= Between the years 1876 and 1885, Epes Randolph worked for several railroads performing location, construction, and maintenance. Railroads he worked for included the Alabama Great Southern Railroad, the Chesapeake, Ohio & Southwestern, and the Kentucky Central. From 1885 to 1890 Randolph was chief engineer of the Kentucky Central R.R., headquartered in Covington, Kentucky. He was also chief engineer of Cincinnati Elevated Railway, Transfer & Bridge Company. Both companies were owned by Collis P. Huntington. From 1886 to 1889 Randolph oversaw the construction of the C&O; Railroad Bridge, a double track railway, highway, and foot traffic bridge across the Ohio River, connecting Covington, Kentucky, with Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1890 Randolph became chief engineer and superintendent of the Newport News & Mississippi Valley Co., the Ohio & Big Sandy Railroad Co. and the Kentucky & S. Atlantic Railroads. During this time he acquired the reputation of being an effective and efficient railroad head. From 1891 to 1894 Randolph was chief engineer and general superintendent of the Chesapeake, Ohio & Southwestern Railroad. In 1894 he developed tuberculosis. He resigned, moved west and for a year worked as a consulting engineer to several railroads while recuperating. He first lived in Indio, California, before moving to Tucson, Arizona, in August 1895 when he became the superintendent for the Southern Pacific Railroad lines from El Paso to Los Angeles. Randolph held this position until 1901. Concurrently he was manager of the Los Angeles Railway & the Pacific Electric Railway. 700 miles of electric lines were built and operating. Randolph served as president of the Los Angeles Railway and the Pacific Electric Railway from 1901 to 1904. He then assumed the role of vice president and general manager. From 1904 to 1909 Randolph served as vice president and general manager of the Gila Valley, Globe and Northern Railway and the Maricopa, Phoenix & Salt River Valley Railroad Co.. In June 1909 he became the general manager of the Cananea, Yaqui River & Pacific R.R. Co. in Mexico. All three railroads were owned by E. H. Harriman. In 1905 Harriman, president of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, asked Randolph to lead the task of closing a breach in the Colorado River. Randolph did so while bedridden in his private railway car the \\"Pocahontas\\". After two years and thousands of tons of rock being poured in the breach was closed on February 10, 1907. In 1911 Randolph became president of the Southern Pacific Railroad of Mexico and Arizona Eastern Railway. He held these positions until his death in 1921. =Other= In 1904 Randolph and Levi Manning, Tucson's mayor from 1905‚Äì1907, partnered to build the upscale Santa Rita Hotel, said at the time to be the most modern hotel in the Southwest. Randolph occupied a suite at the Santa Rita at the time of his death. Randolph was president of the California Development Company, a project to irrigate desert land in eastern California. Civic activities Epes Randolph was a life member of the Elks lodge, an honorary 33d degree Mason, and president of the Old Pueblo Club at the time of his death. Epes Randolph became a member of the University of Arizona Board of Regents in 1916, and was president of the Board of Regents and chairman of the executive committee at the time of his death. Failing health After many years of suffering from tuberculosis, Epes Randolph suffered a series of severe pulmonary hemorrhages in January 1921. Randolph spent February 1921 recuperating in Empalme, Sonora, returning to Tucson in early March. In June Randolph vacationed in California for five weeks, where he was examined and his health appeared to mostly return. He returned to Tucson on August 12. Death and tribute On Monday, August 22, 1921, Epes Randolph worked a full day at the executive offices of the Arizona Eastern Railroad. Feeling \\"unusually strong and well\\" Randolph took a short automobile ride with his wife after work. They had supper at the Santa Rita Hotel and retired to their suite. Instead of turning to bed early as he normally did, he was reading a newspaper when he suffered a pulmonary hemorrhage seizure shortly after 10 pm. Randolph's wife called a doctor to attend him, and though he partially recovered for a few minutes, he was unable to speak and died shortly thereafter. He was sixty five years old. Reaction to Randolph's death was swift and extensive. Though in poor health, Randolph's death was unexpected and met with shock. On Tuesday, August 23, his death was front-page news with photographs in the morning Arizona Daily Star, the evening Tucson Citizen, and the Arizona Gazette of Phoenix. The three office buildings of the Southern Pacific, the Eastern Arizona Railroad, and the Southern Pacific de Mexico in Tucson were closed and draped with black crepe in mourning. The offices remained closed until Friday. That afternoon the Tucson City Council passed a resolution in honor of Epes Randolph in special session. The Kiwanis Club eulogized Randolph and held a moment of silence. Randolph's body was laid in state at the Scottish Masonic temple. The casket was completely hidden behind floral arrangements that stretched across the rostrum from wall to wall. On Wednesday, August 24, the flag was lowered to half mast on the Arizona State Capitol for the day upon news of his death. All trains and depots of the Arizona Eastern, Southern Pacific, and the Southern Pacific de Mexico railroad were draped in mourning until after the funeral. The executive board of the Retail Merchant's Association and the board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce passed resolutions requesting all members to close at 4 PM the following day. The Board of Supervisors of Pima County passed a resolution in honor of Randolph. University of Arizona president Dr. von KleinSmid wrote a tribute for Randolph on behalf of the officials and faculty of the University of Arizona. That night a Knights Templar service was held at 8 pm, followed by a Kadosh ceremony at midnight. Reported as \\"extremely brilliant and beautiful\\" and \\"performed only upon rarest occasions,\\" Randolph was the first person to be honored with a Kadosh ceremony in Arizona. On Thursday, August 25, every business, store, and county office in Tucson closed at 4 pm. The Masonic temple was filled to capacity of 700 people for the 5 o'clock funeral rites. Tucson police had additional traffic officers on duty as a crowd of over 1000 gathered outside. Over 100 mourners, including the Arizona state Governor Thomas E. Campbell, state officials, Phoenix members of the Masons, and businessmen traveled by train from Phoenix to Tucson for the funeral. At 5 PM, all trains and every wheel in the shops of the Southern Pacific, Arizona Eastern and Southern Pacific of Mexico railroads stopped for one minute to mark his death. After the ceremony at the Masonic Temple, the funeral procession traveled to Evergreen Cemetery for interment. The funeral procession crossed the railroad tracks to the cemetery and a train was stopped as the funeral procession passed. Another Masonic ceremony, longer than the 5 o'clock ceremony, was held at the grave site. Named after Epes Randolph In 1908 The village of Randolph, California, was founded just south of Brea Canyon. The Epes Randolph Lodge No. 32 of Free & Accepted Masons was chartered on February 14, 1923, in Tucson, Arizona. Randolph Street in Huntington Park, California, and Randolph Way in Tucson, Arizona, are named for him. Randolph Park, A 480-acre park in central Tucson created four years after Randolph's death was named in his honor. A bust, accompanied by four plaques detailing his life's work, is located near the park's center, at Camino Campestre and Randolph Way.

The British subtitle is \\"The Most Intriguing Scientific Mysteries of Our Time\\" while the American is \\"The Most Baffling ...\\" (see image). Based on an article Brooks wrote for New Scientist in March 2005,Brooks, Michael, 13 Things That Don't Make Sense March 2005, space.newscientist.com the book, aimed at the general reader rather than the science community, contains discussion and description of a number of unresolved issues in science. It is a literary effort to discuss some of the inexplicable anomalies that after centuries science still cannot completely comprehend.Brooks, Michael, 13 Things That Don't Make Sense, August 2008, Randon House Inc., Chapter 1 The Missing Universe. This deals with astronomy and theoretical physics and the ultimate fate of the universe, in particular the search for understanding of dark matter and dark energy and includes discussion of: the work of astronomers Vesto Slipher and then Edwin Hubble in demonstrating the universe is expanding; Vera Rubin's investigation of galaxy rotation curves that suggest something other than gravity is preventing galaxies from spinning apart, which led to the revival of unobserved \\"dark matter\\" theory; experimental efforts to discover dark matter, including the search for the hypothetical neutralino and other weakly interacting massive particles); the study of supernovae at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Harvard University (under Robert Kirshner) that point to an accelerating universe powered by \\"dark energy\\" possibly Vacuum energy; and finally the assertion that the proposed modified Newtonian dynamics hypothesis and the accelerating universe disproves the dark matter theory. Chapter 2 The Pioneer Anomaly. This discusses the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 space probes, which appear to be veering off course and drifting towards the sun. There is growing speculation as to whether this phenomenon can be explained by a yet-undetermined fault in the rockets' systems or whether this obliges us to rethink theories of physics such as gravity. The lead investigator into the progress of the rockets is physicist Slava Turyshev of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California who is analysing the data of the rockets' launch and progress and \\"reflying\\" the missions as computer simulations to try to find a solution to the mystery. However, in 2012, after the book was published, Turyshev was able to give an explanation to the Pioneer Anomaly. Chapter 3 Varying Constants. This chapter discusses the reliability of some physical constants, quantities or values that are held to be always fixed. One of these, the Fine-structure constant, which calculates the behaviour and amount of energy transmitted in subatomic interactions from light reflection and refraction to nuclear fusion, has been called into question by physicist John Webb of the University of New South Wales who may have identified differences in the behaviour of light from quasars and light sources today. According to Webb's observations quasar light appears to refract different shades of colour from light waves emitted today. Brooks also discusses the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor, in which the natural conditions in caves in Gabon 2 billion years ago caused the uranium there to react. It may be that the amount of energy released was different from today. Both sets of data are subject to ongoing investigation and debate but, Brooks suggests, may indicate that the behaviour of matter and energy can vary radically and essentially as the conditions of the universe changes through time. Chapter 4 Cold Fusion. A review of efforts to create nuclear energy at room temperature using hydrogen that is embedded in a metal crystal lattice. Theoretically, this should not happen, because nuclear fusion requires a huge activation energy to get it started. The effect was first reported by chemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in 1989, but attempts to reproduce it over the ensuing months were mostly unsuccessful. Cold fusion research was discredited, and articles on the subject became difficult to publish. But according to the book, a scattering of scientists around the world continue to report positive results, with multiple, independent verifications, making the evidence difficult to deny. Chapter 5 Life. This chapter describes efforts to define life and how it emerged from inanimate matter (Abiogenesis) and even recreate Artificial life including: the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment by chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicago in 1953 to spark life into a mixture of chemicals by using an electrical charge; Steen Rasmussen's work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to implant primitive DNA, Peptide nucleic acid, into soap molecules and heat them up; and the work of the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter at the University of California. Chapter 6 Viking. A discussion of the experiments by engineer Gilbert Levin to search for life on Mars in the 1970s as part of the Viking program. Levin's Labeled Release experiment appeared to conclusively show that life does exist on Mars, but as his results were not supported by the other three Viking biological experiments, they were called into question and eventually not accepted by NASA, which instead hypothesized that the gases observed being generated may not have been a product of living metabolism but of a chemical reaction of hydrogen peroxide. Brooks goes into detail on some of Levin's other experiments and also describes how NASA's subsequent missions to Mars have focused on the geology and climate of the planet rather than looking for life on the planet. (Several missions are searching for water and geological conditions which could support life on Mars currently or in the past.) Chapter 7 The Wow! Signal. Brooks discusses whether or not the signal spotted by astronomer Jerry R. Ehman at the Big Ear radio telescope of Ohio State University in 1977 was a genuine indication of intelligent life in outer space. This was a remarkably clear signal and Big Ear was the largest and longest running SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) radio-telescope project in the world. Brooks goes on to discuss the abandonment of NASA's Microwave Observing Program after government funding was stopped by the efforts of senator Richard Bryan of Nevada. There is no public funding for similar observations today while the SETI Institute, which continues NASA's work, is funded by private donation, as are a number of other initiatives (see SETI). Chapter 8 A Giant Virus. Brooks describes the huge and highly resistant Mimivirus found in Bradford, England in 1992 and whether this challenges the traditional view of viruses being inanimate chemicals rather than living things. Mimivirus is not only much larger than most viruses but it also has a much more complex genetic structure. The discovery of Mimivirus has given weight to the theories of microbiologist Philip Bell and others that viral infection was indeed the reason for the emergence from primitive life forms of complex cell structures based on a cell nucleus. (See viral eukaryogenesis.) Study of the behaviour and structure of viruses is ongoing. Chapter 9 Death. Beginning with the example of Blanding's turtle and certain species of fish, amphibians and reptiles that do not age as they grow older, Brooks discusses theories and research into the evolution of ageing. These include the studies of Peter Medawar and George C. Williams in the 1950s and Thomas Johnson, David Friedman and Cynthia Kenyon in the 1980s claiming that ageing is a genetic process that has evolved as organism select genes that help them to grow and reproduce over ones that help them to thrive in later life. Brooks also talks about Leonard Hayflick, as well as others, who have observed that cells in culture will at a fixed point in time stop reproducing and die as their DNA eventually becomes corrupted by continuous division, a mechanical process at cell level rather than part of a creature's genetic code. Chapter 10 Sex. This chapter is a discussion of theories of the evolution of sexual reproduction. The common-sense explanation is that although asexual reproduction is much easier and more efficient for an organism it is less common than sexual reproduction because having two parents allows species to adapt and evolve more easily to survive in changing environments. Brooks discusses efforts to prove this by laboratory experiment and goes on to discuss alternative theories including the work of Joan Roughgarden of Stanford University who proposes that sexual reproduction, rather than being driven by Charles Darwin's sexual selection in individuals, is a mechanism for the survival of social groupings, which most higher species depend on for survival. Chapter 11 Free Will. Discusses the experimental investigations into the Neuroscience of free will by Benjamin Libet of the University of California, San Francisco and others, which show that the brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them and discusses the implications of these findings on our conception of free will. Chapter 12 The Placebo Effect. This is a discussion of the role of the placebo in modern medicine, including examples such as Diazepam, which, Brooks claims, in some situations appears to work only if the patient knows they are taking it. Brooks describes research into prescription behaviour which appears to show that use of placebos is commonplace. He describes the paper by Asbj√∏rn Hrobjartsson and Peter C. G√∏tzsche in the New England Journal of Medicine that challenges use of placebos entirely, and the work of others towards an understanding of the mechanism of the effect. Chapter 13 Homeopathy. Brooks discusses the work of researcher Madeleine Ennis involving a homeopathic solution which once contained histamine but was diluted to the point where no histamine remained. Brooks conjectures that the results might be explained by some previously unknown property of water. Brooks supports the investigation of documented anomalies even though he is critical of the practice of homeopathy in general, as are many of the scientists he cites, such as Martin Chaplin of South Bank University.

She was born as Maisie Gottlieb in Oldham, northeast of Manchester, England, on 7 December 1924, the eldest of three children. Her parents were of Latvian Jewish and Viennese Jewish descent, and both sides emigrated to England around 1900. A clever girl, she wanted to study medicine but, because of her mother's illness, as the eldest child she had to leave school at the age of 14 to help in the family business. At the age of 18 she joined the ATS and, at the end of World War II, was helping to teach illiterate soldiers how to read. She married twice: to Aubrey Liston in 1948, then to Gerald Mosco in 1957. She died in London on 31 October 2011, aged 86. Writings After the war, she edited a Manchester Jewish weekly newspaper, the Jewish Gazette, subsequently writing radio plays for the BBC. One of her stage plays, Happy Family, became the basis of a horror film Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly. She also wrote 16 novels between 1979 and 1998. These include the 'Almonds and Raisins' series (Almonds & Raisins, Scattered Seed, Children's Children, Out of the Ashes, and New Beginnings), about a Jewish family who around 1900 fled anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire and emigrated to north Manchester in England. These books contained elements of her own family history. In Almonds and Raisins the newly arrived Sanberg family see a tram for the first time - a Manchester double-decker. Abraham (the father) exclaims, \\"A train with two storeys? And no roof?\\" [Manchester trams were open-topped in those days.] The local rabbi explains: \\"In English, they call it a tram.... In Yiddish, we don't have a word for it.\\" \\"In the wire overhead, there's electricity, we don't have a word for that either.\\" References External links *Bibliography * Category:1924 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Oldham Category:English women novelists Category:20th-century English novelists Category:20th-century English women writers ","title":"Maisie Mosco"},{"id":"28253349","text":"Ronaldo Concei√ß√£o Silveira (born 3 April 1987), usually known as Ronaldo or Ronaldo Concei√ß√£o, is a Brazilian football defender.

He was born on the 13th September 1896 and died on the 8th May 1951. He is popular for translating the Sri Lankan national anthem into Tamil which is an official language of the country along with Sinhalese. Translation was officially accepted from 1950 and is still being used in areas where Tamil is widely spoken, especially in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Biography Nallathambi was born in Vadukkottai, in Jaffna district, the son of Muruga Pillai and Thangammayarukkam. He learnt literary grammar from Thenkovai and Pandit S Kanthayapillai. Later he worked as a Tamil scholar and teacher at Zahira College, Colombo and visiting lecturer at the University of Colombo, he was instrumental in promoting the language amongst many Muslims and other prominent people amongst his own community. His works have been widely quoted by many scholars and journalists. Poetry Pandit Nallathamby received an honorary title \\"Muthu Tamil Pulavar\\" from Thirunelvely Tamil Sangam, South India, in 1940. He also won the first prize for his collection of poems titled \\"Maniththaai Nadum Marathan Oddamum\\" (Mother Lanka and Marathon Relay), in 1950, by participating in a poetry competition organised by the Sri Lankan government to mark the country's independence in 1948. His books \\"Eezhavasakam and \\"Mozhi Payirchi\\" were used as school texts. A collection of his children poems \\"Ilaignar Virunthu\\" was published after his death. Tamil National Anthem Most Sri Lankans agree that Ananda Samarakoon wrote the lyrics to the anthem in 1940, being inspired by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. The anthem was translated into Tamil by Nallathambi in 1950 under the title \\"Sri Lanka Thaye\\". In 2010, The Sunday Times reported that the government were to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem. In 2016, President Maithripala Sirisena lifted the unofficial ban on the Tamil anthem and it was sung at independence day celebrations. In 2020, the government stopped using the anthem in these celebrations. References Category:National anthem writers Category:1896 births Category:1951 deaths ","title":"M.

Early life and works Zeytuntsyan was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1938. In the aftermath of World War II, his family moved to Soviet Armenia during a period of intense economic hardship. Zeytuntsyan attended the Aghayan School in Yerevan and it was during this period that he published his first short story ‚ÄúNvere‚Äù [The Gift] (1953). Several years later, he published his first collection, Nra arajin enkere [His First Companion]. The latter work won him critical acclaim, after which he published a series of novels and novellas, including Mer taghi dzaynere [Sounds of Our Neighborhood] (1959), Mezanitz heto [After Us] (1963), Parizi hamar [For Paris] (1965), Klod Robert Isrli kam xx dari legend [Claude Robert Eatherly or a Twentieth-Century Legend] (1975), Arshak Erkrord [Arshak the Second], Verjin arevagale [The Last Dawn] (1989), and Goghatsvats Dzyune [The Stolen Snow] (1995). Since their publication, many of these works have been translated into Russian, Czech, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and the languages of the Baltic Republics. Theatrical works Zeytuntsyan wrote his first theatrical work, Amenatkhur marde [The Saddest Man], in 1974. The work was a tragicomedy staged in Yerevan, and since then, ten of his plays have been produced and later published in the Armenian Republic. These include Avervats kaghaki araspele [The Legend of the Ruined City] (1975), Astvatsneri kanche [The Call of the Gods], Anavart menakhosutyun [Unfinished Monologue] (1981), Mec Irutyune [The Great Silence] (1984), Otki, datarann e galis [All Rise, The Court is in Session] (1988), and Tsnvel e u mahatsel [Born and Died] (1995). Themes and subject matter A recurrent theme in Zeytuntsyan‚Äôs works has been the relationship between the individual, society, and the exercise of authority. The majority of his plays draw their subject matter from Armenian history, particularly historical episodes that are relevant to contemporary issues. One major theme in his more recent prose and theatrical works is the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire, reflecting the growth of nationalism in the Armenian Republic towards the end of Soviet rule. His novel the Last Dawn as well as his plays The Great Silence and All Rise, the Court Is in Session explore these themes. These plays have often been performed in both Armenia and different areas of the Armenian Diaspora. Film and recent works After graduating from an advanced screenwriting course in Moscow in 1964, Zeytuntsyan worked at the Hayfilm center in Yerevan, later becoming the senior editor of the art film section of the Yerevan studio for television films from 1968-1975. The film Erevanyan oreri khronika [Chronicle of Yerevan Days] (1973) was based on his screenplay. He also went on to write a number of speeches and newspaper articles focusing on sociopolitical issues affecting the Armenian Republic. One collection of these works, titled Tsulere der ayntegh en [The Bulls Are Still There] (1990) won the Golden Pen Award of the Republic‚Äôs Union of Journalists. He has since received myriad accolades, including the State Prize of Armenia, the republic‚Äôs highest award. In 1975, Zeytuntsyan became the executive secretary of the Writer‚Äôs Union of Armenia, a position he held until 1981.

They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about to a range of about . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute. The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft. However, the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft. In 1884 two above-water torpedo tubes were added. Two more were added in 1891. Friedland had a complete wrought iron waterline belt. The sides and the transverse bulkheads of the battery itself were armoured with of wrought iron. The barbettes were unarmoured. Service Friedland was laid down at Lorient in January 1865 and launched on 15 October 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known, the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age.Ropp, pp. 31, 55‚Äì58 The ship began her sea trials on 1 May 1875, but was not completed until 20 June 1877. Friedland joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1878 and the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax from 6‚Äì16 July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia.Wilson, pp. 2‚Äì4 She was reduced to reserve in 1887 and decommissioned in 1893.

Plot Within an old dilapidated and seemingly automated theater, human-sized marionettes perform a production of the Don Juan legend without the aid of puppeteers or an audience. In the play, Don Juan's fianc√©e Maria is secretly seeing his brother Don Phillipe. Unbeknownst to the two lovers, Don Juan is watching them from one of the balconies. Horrified by the thought of Maria leaving him for Philippe, he calls upon his Jester servant for help. So that he can pay for a wedding, Juan sends the Fool into town to ask for money from the Mayor (Juan and Phillipe's father), under the false pretense that Juan needs the money to pay off medical bills. When Juan's father learns about his son's true intentions, he gives the Jester two coins so he and Juan can buy some rope to hang themselves with. Outraged by this, Don Juan murders his own father backstage and heads over to the garden where Maria and Philippe were planning to meet. Maria arrives shortly after but is shocked to discover Don Juan there instead of her true love Philippe. Demanding that she return his feelings or face the consequences, he chases after Maria but is stopped by her father, Don Vespis, who now realizes Juan is unfit to marry his daughter and threatens to have him arrested. Don Juan dispatches of Maria's father by cutting his face off, and as he lay dying he swears his ghost will haunt Don Juan to exact his revenge. Philippe soon discovers Maria mourning her dead father, and swears to avenge them both. He eventually finds Don Juan and the two engage in a duel which ends with Philippe's gory demise. The Jester then arrives to tell Juan that there is a spectral man who wants to speak with him in the cemetery. The man turns out to be the spirit of Maria's dead father, who warns Don Juan that his soul will be dragged to Hell at midnight. As in the traditional Czech puppet plays, Juan urges children not to commit evil deeds like him. Juan's physical body keels over dead into an open grave, while his spirit is lowered into a trapdoor. Instead of being dragged into Hell as the legend suggests, the lifeless puppet merely falls into a compartment beneath the stage. Upon discovering an inanimate Don Juan, The Jester asks how he is going to get paid with his master dead.

Theodore Strauss of New York Times panned the film, calling it \\"a very mild hate-brew\\" and \\"third-rate drama\\", and stating, \\"Nowadays, we doubt whether anybody, even Hirohito, will be much excited\\". Variety wrote that \\"the picture doesn't achieve more than moderately entertaining proportions for the adult ... Foster and Miss Bari show off excellently, though some of the supporting parts are pretty awful.\\" Film Daily called it \\"a rousing melodrama\\" but found the twists and turns of the plot confusing. Harrison's Reports wrote: \\"An engrossing espionage melodrama that is timely. The story value is good, and competent direction and excellent performances help maintain the interest throughout.\\" References External links  Category:1942 films Category:American films Category:American spy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Irving Pichel Category:Pearl Harbor films Category:American World War II propaganda films Category:1940s spy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films set in Shanghai Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"Secret Agent of Japan"},{"id":"28253804","text":"The upper-case (left) and lower-case (right) letter pairs of the Zaghawa also known as Beria alphabet. Alphabetic order follows the Latin: . The Zaghawa or Beria script, Beria Giray Erfe ('Zaghawa Writing Marks'), is an indigenous alphabetic script proposed for the Zaghawa language (also known as Beria) of Darfur and Chad. In the 1950s, a Sudanese Zaghawa schoolteacher named Adam Tajir created an alphabet for the Zaghawa language, sometimes known as the camel alphabet, deriving its glyphs from the clan brands used for camels and other livestock. He copied the inventory of the Arabic script, so the system was not ideal for Zaghawa. In 2000, a Zaghawa veterinarian named Siddick Adam Issa adapted Tajir's script to a form which has proven popular in the Zaghawa community. The typography is somewhat innovative in that capital letters have descenders which drop below the baseline of the lower-case letters and punctuation, contrasting with the capital letters which rise above most lower- case letters in the Latin alphabet. Beria Giray Erfe is a full alphabet, with independent letters for vowels; however, diacritics are used to mark tone (grave accent for falling tone and acute accent for rising tone; high, mid, and low tone are unmarked), as well as advanced tongue root vowels (a macron derives from the letters for ). The letter for , which does not occur in Zaghawa or in Arabic, is written by adding a tail to the letter for ; and is derived from the letter for with a cross stroke.

Numerous sRNAs have been identified using both computational analysis and laboratory-based techniques such as Northern blotting, microarrays and RNA-Seq in a number of bacterial species including Escherichia coli, the model pathogen Salmonella, the nitrogen-fixing alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, marine cyanobacteria, Francisella tularensis (the causative agent of tularaemia), Streptococcus pyogenes, the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae. Bacterial sRNAs affect how genes are expressed within bacterial cells via interaction with mRNA or protein, and thus can affect a variety of bacterial functions like metabolism, virulence, environmental stress response, and structure. Origin In the 1960s, the abbreviation sRNA was used to refer to \\"soluble RNA,\\" which is now known as transfer RNA or tRNA (for an example of the abbreviation used in this sense, see). It is now known that most bacterial sRNAs are encoded by free-standing genes located in the intergenic regions (IGR) between two known genes. However, a class of sRNAs are shown to be derived from the 3'-UTR of mRNAs by independent transcription or nucleolytic cleavage. The first bacterial sRNA was discovered and characterized in 1984. MicF in E. coli was found to regulate the expression of a key structural gene that makes up the outer membrane of the E. coli cell. Shortly after, the Staphylococcus aureus sRNA RNAIII was found to act as a global regulator of S. aureus virulence and toxin secretion. Since these initial discoveries, over six thousand bacterial sRNAs have been identified, largely through RNA-sequencing experiments.  Techniques  Several laboratory and bioinformatic techniques can be used to identify and characterize sRNA transcripts. * RNA-sequencing, or RNA-seq, is used to analyze expression levels of all transcripts in a genome, including sRNAs. * Microarrays use complementary DNA probes to bind to possible sRNA loci in intergenic regions. * Northern blotting can reveal possible sRNA transcript size and expression levels by running a mixed RNA sample on an agarose gel and probing for a desired sRNA. * Target prediction software can predict possible interactions between sRNAs and mRNA by finding regions of complementarity within sRNA and mRNA target sequences. * RNase crosslinking can experimentally validate sRNA and mRNA interactions by crosslinking a sRNA and its target with UV light, along with RNase enzymes that are also usually involved in the interaction. The sRNA:mRNA hybrid can then be isolated and analyzed. Function Four common mechanisms of bacterial sRNA interaction with mRNA or protein targets. Bacterial sRNAs have a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms. Generally, sRNAs can bind to protein targets and modify the function of the bound protein. Alternately, sRNAs may interact with mRNA targets and regulate gene expression by binding to complementary mRNA and blocking translation, or by unmasking or blocking the ribosome-binding site. sRNAs that interact with mRNA can also be categorized as cis- or trans-acting. Cis-acting sRNAs interact with genes encoded on the same genetic locus as the sRNA. Some cis- acting sRNAs act as riboswitches, which have receptors for specific environmental or metabolic signals and activate or repress genes based on these signals. Conversely, trans-encoded sRNAs interact with genes on separate loci. =House-keeping= Amongst the targets of sRNAs are a number of house- keeping genes. The 6S RNA binds to RNA polymerase and regulates transcription, tmRNA has functions in protein synthesis, including the recycling of stalled ribosomes, 4.5S RNA regulates signal recognition particle (SRP), which is required for the secretion of proteins and RNase P is involved in maturing tRNAs. =Stress response= Many sRNAs are involved in stress response regulation. They are expressed under stress conditions such as cold shock, iron depletion, onset of the SOS response and sugar stress. The small RNA nitrogen stress-induced RNA 1 (NsiR1) is produced by Cyanobacteria under conditions of nitrogen deprivation. Cyanobacteria NisR8 and NsiR9 sRNAs could be related to the differentiation of nitrogen-fixing cells (heterocysts). =Regulation of RpoS= The RpoS gene in E. coli encodes sigma 38, a sigma factor which regulates stress response and acts as a transcriptional regulator for many genes involved in cell adaptation. At least three sRNAs, DsrA, RprA and OxyS, regulate the translation of RpoS. DsrA and RprA both activate RpoS translation by base pairing to a region in the leader sequence of the RpoS mRNA and disrupting formation of a hairpin which frees up the ribosome loading site. OxyS inhibits RpoS translation. DsrA levels are increased in response to low temperatures and osmotic stress, and RprA levels are increased in response to osmotic stress and cell-surface stress, therefore increasing RpoS levels in response to these conditions. Levels of OxyS are increased in response to oxidative stress, therefore inhibiting RpoS under these conditions. =Regulation of outer membrane proteins= The outer membrane of gram negative bacteria acts as a barrier to prevent the entry of toxins into the bacterial cell, and plays a role in the survival of bacterial cells in diverse environments. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) include porins and adhesins. Numerous sRNAs regulate the expression of OMPs. The porins OmpC and OmpF are responsible for the transport of metabolites and toxins. The expression of OmpC and OmpF is regulated by the sRNAs MicC and MicF in response to stress conditions. The outer membrane protein OmpA anchors the outer membrane to the murein layer of the periplasmic space. Its expression is downregulated in the stationary phase of cell-growth. In E. coli the sRNA MicA depletes OmpA levels, in Vibrio cholerae the sRNA VrrA represses synthesis of OmpA in response to stress. =Virulence= In some bacteria sRNAs regulate virulence genes. In Salmonella, the pathogenicity island encoded InvR RNA represses synthesis of the major outer membrane protein OmpD; another co-activated DapZ sRNA from 3'-UTR represses abundant membrane Opp/Dpp transporters of oligopeptides; and SgrS sRNA regulates the expression of the secreted effector protein SopD. In Staphylococcus aureus, RNAIII regulates a number of genes involved in toxin and enzyme production and cell-surface proteins. The FasX sRNA is the only well-characterized regulatory RNA known to control the regulation of several virulence factors in Streptococcus pyogenes, including both cell-surface associated adhesion proteins as well as secreted factors. =Quorum sensing= In Vibrio species, the Qrr sRNAs and the chaperone protein Hfq are involved in the regulation of quorum sensing. Qrr sRNAs regulate the expression of several mRNAs including the quorum-sensing master regulators LuxR and HapR. = Biofilm Formation = Biofilm is a type of bacterial growth pattern where multiple layers of bacterial cells adhere to a host surface. This mode of growth is often found in pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can form persistent biofilm within the respiratory tract and cause chronic infection. The P. aeruginosa sRNA SbrA was found to be necessary for full biofilm formation and pathogenicity. A mutant P. aeruginosa strain with SbrA deleted formed a 66% smaller biofilm and its ability to infect a nematode model was reduced by nearly half when compared to wildtype P. aeruginosa. = Antibiotic Resistance = Several bacterial sRNAs are involved in the regulation of genes that confer antibiotic resistance. For example, the sRNA DsrA regulates a drug efflux pump in E. coli, which is a system that mechanically pumps antibiotic out of bacterial cells. E. coli MicF also contributes to antibiotic resistance of cephalosporins, as it regulates membrane proteins involved in uptake of these class of antibiotics. Target prediction In order to understand an sRNA's function one primarily needs to describe its targets. Here, target predictions represent a fast and free method for initial characterization of putative targets, given that the sRNA actually exerts its function via direct base pairing with a target RNA. Examples are CopraRNA, IntaRNA, TargetRNA and RNApredator. It has been shown that target prediction for enterobacterial sRNAs can benefit from transcriptome wide Hfq-binding maps.

Formation Egyptian Camel Corps personnel. Drivers wearing skyblue Jellabiyas Britain had occupied Egypt and controlled the Egyptian government after invading the country during the 19th century. At the beginning of the war, Britain set up the Protectorate of Egypt and imposed Martial Law, giving a solemn pledge to defend Egypt and not call on the Egyptian people to aid them in the conflict.Wavell 1968, pp. 25‚Äì6Wilson 1934, p. 3. However, the British quickly came to realise they desperately needed the support of Egyptian labour, camel drivers and their camels in a land that was so inhospitable to Europeans. The great value of this service was also acknowledged by General Allenby in his Despatch of 16 December 1917 where he mentions their steadiness under fire and devotion to duty.A Brief Record of the Advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force under the command of General Sir Edmund H.H. Allenby, GCB, GCMG July 1917 to October 1918 compiled from Official Sources, p. 24. Early in the conflict, volunteers for the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, often from extremely poor villages, like those in the Egyptian Labour Corps were given a daily inducement of 7 Piastres (one shilling and six pence) and rations. Later it was necessary to utilize the already imposed British military authority over all Egyptian officials and civilians. Then the Muidir, Lord Lieutenant or Omdah, mayors of Egyptian towns, for a consideration organised press gangs and the necessary native armed guards to keep the forced labour at work. Members of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps were 'sealed' by a seal attached to their wrists for periods that appear to have started as quite short term but became quite extended as the importance of their service was recognised.Carman & McPherson [eds] 1983, pp. 147‚Äì9Letter Wingate to Allenby 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154‚Äì5See also War Diary 3rd LHB April 1919 p. 43 and War Diary 4th LHB Weekly Report 5 to 12 April 1919 Appendix 29 which demonstrate the chain of command between the Army and the Muidir, and Omdah exercised during the Egyptian Rebellion.

They saw service transporting supplies of all kinds across the flooded plain north of Gaza and Beersheba, up into the rocky inhospitable Judean Hills towards Jerusalem in late 1917, down the precipitous tracks to Jericho in the Jordan Valley, up into the even less hospitable hills of Moab towards Es Salt and Amman and also followed on the great victorious advance northwards in 1918, carrying ammunition, water and all types of stores for the men and horses of the fighting units at the front, and carried the wounded back.Carman & McPherson 1983, p. 147. Brigade Headquarters Office Ready for the Road Training of the camel corps had less to do with the Egyptian camel drivers who were often familiar with camel care and control, being mainly concerned with the problems the Australian and British officers and NCOs, who had transferred from the Army Service Corps and other AIF units, had in dealing with the animals. During this time, one or more of these men were regularly sent to hospitals with camel bites.Carman & McPherson 1983, pp. 147‚Äì8. Of the Australians, 49 were eventually commissioned and six became company commanders, so the Anzac and Imperial/Australian Mounted Divisions had a strong national component in their supporting camel transport.Lindsay 1992, pp. 213‚Äì4.

They may have to travel as far as accompanied by flies and camel smells and grunts.Woodward 2006, p. 35Downes 1938, pp. 560, 562, 563, 564 Sinai Peninsula =Patrols= As all wheeled vehicles had been left at Kantara, nothing but sections of Camel Transport Corps accompanied all the patrols across Sinai as on Monday 29 May 1916, when a patrol by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was accompanied by 850 camels carrying water, food and ammunition when they rode out from Etmaler.Powles 1922, p. 23Kinloch 2007, p. 74 The drivers and camels of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps were also called on in the Sinai to transport aeroplanes. General Harry Chauvel describes how this was done: =Battle of Romani= On 21 July, the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps marched out for Romani with 2000 camels, 20 riding dromedaries, 12,000 natives, O.C., Adjutant, 5 Sectional OCs including McPherson, a number of NCOs and the usual attendant details ‚Äì saddlers, ambulance, vets, batmen, orderlies etc. Ordered to march in mid summer during the middle of the day the sand burnt and cracked the camel drivers' feet. Half didn't have a water bottle and they fainted with thirst, heat and weariness, falling out or plodding on blindly.McPherson 1983, pp. 151‚Äì3 About 10,000 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels concentrated at Romani as well as innumerable troops prior to the attack.McPherson 1983, p. 154Bruce 2002, p. 44 Until more camel transport was accumulated at Romani and Pelusium for the distribution of supplies and drinking water from railhead, the firepower of the main defences could only be increased by moving up the machine gun companies of 53 and 54 Divisions.Keogh 1955, p. 49 On the first day of battle, 4 August 1916 McPherson and his section of Egyptian Camel Transport Corps was attempting to deliver water to the Worcester Regiment of 5th Mounted Division, when they came under fire: McPherson and his section of Egyptian Camel Transport Corps was also involved the next day, in the pursuit on 5 August. At 10 AM his 200 camels moved out from Pelusium Station, this time to supply water to the 127th Brigade, composed of the Manchester regiments in the 42nd Division. However, before they arrived a tragedy was unfolding; McPherson Private Robert Bethel, also involved with transporting water and provisions to the fighting men, was serving in the Army Service Corps in support of the 42nd Division's 125th Brigade. He describes his involvement on 5 August 1916: On 6 August, the eve of the Greater Bairam (celebrating the end of the Islamic year) the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani was ordered to move out at dawn to toil eastward. In the morning 150 men (most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged) refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their extra rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were separated into small groups. They were divided up amongst three brigades of artillery, two field companies of engineers, the Glasgow Yeomanry, a Mobile Veterinary Section, a Machine Gun and Wire Line section; all units of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division.McPherson pp. 161‚Äì2 =Advance to Bir el Abd= Ordered to follow the troops attempting to cut off the enemy retreat, McPherson describes the problems which developed among his section of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps when the terms of employment were changed and resulting unrest was dealt with. =Bir el Abd= Bostock with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade Scouts near Bir el Abd, guided in the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps: McPherson describes Bir el Abd: =Bir el Maghara Raid October 1916= Sections of the Camel Transport Corps took part in operations to Bir el Maghara in the interior of the Sinai Peninsula. The Column formed of 800 Australian Light Horse, 400 City of London Yeomanry, 600 Mounted Camelry and 4,500 Transport Camels, also 200 Camels for Army Medical Corps work moved out from Bayoud on 13 October 1916.12th Light Horse Regiment War Diary AWM4‚Äì10‚Äì17‚Äì2 page 28 =El Arish= Transport on the beach at El Arish The provision of water for the attacking force was the most difficult, but most vital element in the preparation for the attack on El Arish as from Mazar to El Arish there was no water and the Turkish defences at El Arish covered all the water in that area. So operations had to wait until the middle of December when the pipe‚Äìline had advanced sufficiently for water to be stored at Maadan (kilo. 128) and for the concentration of camels and drivers of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, large enough to carry the water forward in support the attack force. Preparations were not complete until 20 December, but in the meantime the enemy had abandoned the town.Downes 1938, p. 590Keogh 1955, p. 72 Other campaigns The CTC also participated in the First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918). Supplies of rations and forage were carried by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps during the advance and retirement of Shea's, augmenting supplies carried by the troops and sent up to the troops fighting at Amman in March 1918 with the help of some pack-horses.Cutlack 1941 p. 108Powles 1922 pp. 211‚Äì2 By 1 May 1918 during the Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt Allenby wrote to the British War Office regarding difficulties he was having in recruitment for the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps. \\"I have sent to you, today, an official letter ‚Äì on the subject of enlistments for the Camel Transport Corps.

It is typically assumed to be a number between 0 and 1 where a number closer to zero implies that there are many applicants for any one position. The selection ratio provides information about the value of assessment tools, such as interviews, work samples, and psychometric tests. When the selection ratio is close to one, most applicants will need to be hired in order to fill the available positions. As such knowing that one applicant is likely to perform better than another is of limited value.

Many programs devoted to this purpose have quite limited resources; for instance, Nottingham Black Prisoner Support, with one staff worker, had 297 active cases in 1999. Black Prisoner Support groups such as Partners of Prisoners have sought to establish productive working relationships with prison staff. South Carolina's Alston Wilkes Society is the largest statewide prison support organization in the United States, with a budget of $918,000 and a staff of 50. It operates two halfway houses, arbitrates prisoner grievances, maintains a youth home, helps ex-inmates find work, and provides social services to prisoners' families. There are many special-interest prison support groups such as the Out of Control Lesbian Committee to Support Women in Prison. Some political movements find it to be in their interests to provide prisoner supports; Break the Chains argues, \\"Any movement that does not support its political internees is a movement destined to fail. When power is challenged, it inevitably turns to violent repression and imprisonment to maintain itself. In order to avoid defeat, movements must become organized and capable of combating the repression of the state apparatus, and they must be able to support their comrades and allies in the event that they are arrested or imprisoned. Few would commit themselves to a movement that would leave them behind prison walls, or a movement that is incapable of sustaining itself in the face of state intimidation.\\" Ratner writes that the prisoner support movement has been hampered by \\"particularly strong public antipathy toward offenders who would deny culpability by assigning blame to the 'system'. This compromises the efforts of prisoner-support groups, who must rally public support in order to procure government funds. Such groups face the dilemma of rapidly losing their own legitimacy should they draw too closely to the very offenders whom they seek to help -- offenders who are not perceived by the public as victims of injustice. Thus, many 'outside' groups are forced to shun the support of inmates who are in prison for violent offences, a serious ideological fracture of inside-outside alliances which limits the possibilities for prisoner politicization.\\" In the early 2000s (decade), the United States Libertarian Party's California affiliate established a Political Prisoner Support Committee. It mostly served to support medical cannabis patients. Spokesperson Ann McCormick opined, \\"we need not only to protect and care for our wounded, but to present them as patriots and heroes of 'the people'.\\" See also *Earth Liberation Prisoners Support Network *Vegan Prisoners Support Group *Prisoner Visitation and Support *Prison Dharma Network *Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants References ","title":"Prisoner support"},{"id":"28254033","text":"Maypole is a dispersed settlement located on the island of St Mary's, the largest of the Isles of Scilly, England.Ordnance Survey mapping It is a tourist and farming area, with the only horse riding school in the islands.ScillyOnline St Mary's Riding Centre - Contact Nearby are Holy Vale and Pelistry.

They were commissioned from the design agency ParaType by Rospechat, a department of the Russian Ministry of Communications, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Peter the Great's orthography reform and to create a font family that supported all the different variations of Cyrillic script used by the minority languages of Russia, as well as the Latin alphabet. Primarily designed by Alexandra Korolkova, the family includes sans-serif and serif designs, both with caption styles for small-print text, and a monospaced font for use in programming. They are available under the English-language SIL Open Font License; the original font, PT Sans, was also released under ParaType's own Free Font License, and regular and bold with italics is free in Google. Additional styles, such as extended, condensed and extra-bold, are sold from ParaType as PT Sans Pro and PT Serif Pro. Features ruble symbol in PT Sans The fonts include Latin and Cyrillic characters and covers almost all minority languages of the Russian Federation. The slashed-–† ruble symbol (before it became official in December 2013) is included at the U+20B9‚Ä¶U+20CF code points. In the most common open-source release, PT Sans and PT Serif feature regular, italic, bold and bold italic designs. They also include a caption style: this is a wider version of the typeface with a greater x-height (taller lower-case letters), designed for legibility at small font sizes and on outdoor signs. PT Sans also includes a condensed version in regular and bold without italics. In caption styles, PT Serif has a caption italic style while PT Sans has a bold version. PT Mono includes regular and bold styles. Commercial releases include for PT Sans additional light, demi-bold, extra bold and black weights, in regular, narrow, condensed and extra-condensed styles. PT Serif gains an additional 32 styles, with narrow and extended widths, black, extra-bold and demi-bold weights. The professional releases also add text figures and small caps.

Ortea et al.'s neotype selection is contested by Gosliner (see http://www.seaslugforum.net/find/3807), and there are thus different opinions on the valid name for the taxonomical species involved. Overall, the European school uses Hypselodoris tricolor and the American school uses Hypselodoris midatlantica. As the neotype designation has not been rejected by the ICZN, we follow here the traditional European usage.Rudman W.B.

Felimare tricolor has a blue body with a yellow-orange line running along the edge of the mantle. There is a single central white-yellow line along the midline of the mantle and paler blue diffuse patches between this line and the sides. The gills are dark blue with a single white line along the midline which becomes more prominent at the tip of each gill. The rhinophores are dark blue with a paler tip but with no yellow or white markings. There is some variation in colour between individuals and regions.

The corporation has its origins from Bohol, and is the flagship company of Lite Holdings, Inc. At present, the corporation also owns and manages Danilo Lines, Inc. and Sunline Shipping Corporation.  History  The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Lirio Enterprises, Inc., a general trading firm doing business nationwide. It started as a shipping division of the mother company in the middle of 1988 when it bought two vessels - the MV Sto. Ni√±o de Soledad, a 500-ton DWT capacity steel-hulled vessel and the MV Sto. Ni√±o, a wooden hull 200-ton capacity vessel. Initially, the cargo loaded was mostly goods traded by Lirio Enterprises, Inc. like salt, rice, cement, fertilizers, sugar, etc. Sometimes they would accept other cargoes for backload when the occasion demands it. This shipping division was spun off as a separate shipping corporation in July 1989 when the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws of Lite Shipping Corporation. The Lite Shipping Corporation fleet then consisted of 15 roll- on/roll-off vessels, 12 passenger vessels and 3 cargo ships. In November 1991, the corporation acquired its third vessel, the MV St. Gabriel, a steel-hulled 30-ton capacity cargo boat due to the strong demand for the smaller cargo vessel in the trading operation of the mother company. In January 1992, the company expanded into the cargo/passenger shipping business with the purchase of a 175 gross-ton roro car/truck carrier from the U.S. Navy, the LCT St. Mark. It has a capacity of four ten-wheeler cargo trucks, five cars and 50 to 70 passengers. It is the franchise holder for the Argao, Cebu to Loon, Bohol route as a daily car/truck ferry.

Distribution and paleoenvironment The description of this species by paleobotanists Kathleen Pigg, Steven Manchester, and Wesley Wehr was based on the study of thirty-four compression fossil specimens found at the UWBM sites B4131 and A0307, the latter being designated the type locality. The specimens are twelve infructescences with attached involucres containing nuts or nut casts, fourteen involucres, and eight isolated paired or single nuts. The holotype specimen is number \\"SR 98-01-02 A&B;\\", an infructescence with involucre, and is housed in the Stonerose Interpretive Center in Republic, Washington. The species epithet johnsonii was coined in honor of Kirk R. Johnson for his continuing work on, and recognition of the importance of, the Republic Flora. Taxonomy Though described as a single species, Pigg et al noted the wide grade of variation in the involucre morphology, ranging from simple to ones with extensive spines. The involucres also show a spectrum from thin, leafy lobes that display distinct veins to thick lobes with no distinct venation. As specimens of C johnsonii have a full morphology range between the three involucre types, the possibility of multiple species is hard to prove or disprove. However the authors chose to name a single species because of the continuous gradation present between the distinct morphologies. Of the two sections into which the genus Corylus is divided, section Corylus and section Acanthochlamys, C. johnsonii is most similar to three species in the latter. Section Acanthochlamys is considered basal within the genus and the three species, Corylus ferox, C.wangii, and C. heterophylla are all native to southeast Asia. Infructescences of Corylus wangii, like those of C. johnsonii, possess narrow lobes with many unbranched and branched spines, while C. ferox- like infructescences have a highly spiny, prickly surface. Specimens within the simple end of the infructescence morphologic range are most similar to C. heterophylla. As C. johnsonii encompasses a wide morphology range within its features, it is possible it may have diverged out into the modern species. The modern areas of distribution for C.ferox and C. heterophylla overlap in the Sichuan province of China, while C. wangii has a distinct and separate range in southwest China. Isolated nuts from Paleocene sediments in Greenland, England, and Montana have been attributed to the genus Corylus. However all lack the surrounding infructescence that is needed to confirm placement of the nuts in a specific coryloid genus. Description The infructescences bear between 2 and 3 nuts at the end of a stout stalk. The nuts, in diameter, are ovoid to almost circular in outline and enclosed in an involucre composed of 2 bracts. While most specimens consist of paired involucres with ovoid nuts or nut casts, several paired or isolated nuts are known. On the nuts themselves basal attachment scars cover a small area of nut; distal scars and style remains are preserved in several specimens. A predominant number of the fruits possess more dissected involucres, some having simple spines, while others have both simple and branched spines.

It can be employed for large-area batch processing or continuous deposition. In 1933 Bruckman deposited lead(II) sulfide (PbS) thin film by chemical bath deposition, or solution growth method. This technique is extensively used to deposit buffer layers in thin film photovoltaic cells. Advantages and disadvantages The major advantage of CBD is that it requires in its simplest form only solution containers and substrate mounting devices. One of the drawbacks of this method is the wastage of the solution after every deposition. Chemical bath deposition yields stable, adherent, uniform, and hard films with good reproducibility by a relatively simple process. The growth of thin films strongly depends on growth conditions, such as duration of deposition, composition, and temperature of the solution, and topographical and chemical nature of the substrate.  Reaction mechanism  The chemical bath deposition involves two steps, nucleation and particle growth, and is based on the formation of a solid phase from a solution. In the chemical bath deposition procedure, the substrate is immersed in a solution containing the precursors. This method depends upon parameters like bath temperature, pH of the solution, the molarity of concentration, and time.

The ship was launched on 23 December 1930 and completed during March 1931. The ship operated with the company's Burns, Philp Line with service to Papua and New Guinea. She was sunk in 1942, as a result of damage suffered by being hit by bombs from Japanese aircraft, near Port Moresby. History Macdhui was a three deck ship registered with Sydney as port of registry, official number 157594, signal LGVM, with registered length of , breadth of , draft with an eight-cylinder engine built by J G Kincaid & Co. Ltd., Greenock. On trials the ship attained a speed of and a wireless record establishing direct contact with Sydney from Scotland. Macdhui crossed the Atlantic and after a rough voyage transited the Panama Canal, acquiring a ship's cat for luck at Balboa, on the delivery voyage to Australia. On 20 June 1937, a serious fire broke out in the ship's engine room in the early hours of the morning, putting the ship in danger. Passengers were ordered into the boats. By four in the morning the engine room fire was out, but damage was severe and the engines were disabled. The European passengers were taken back aboard with some 150 islanders as deck passengers, and were then put ashore at Fortification Point. A second, minor fire broke out in the number four hold, and was quickly put out. Responding to the distress call Neptuna, another of the company's ships, reached Macdhui the next day to tow the disabled ship to port. In December 1941 with Japanese threatening islands to the north the Australian government decided to begin evacuating women and children from New Guinea, Papua, and Darwin. Macdhui along with Katoomba, Neptuna, and Zealandia transported the evacuees to ports in Australia out of immediate danger. After Japanese landing on Rabaul some of the troops evacuated to Port Moresby were transported to Townsville aboard Macdhui in late April 1942. After the initial bombing on 19 February 1942, Japanese air raids continued on Darwin during June, with a sixteenth raid on 13 June. Raids continued each night through to the 17 June, when Port Moresby had its 61st raid. Macdhui was hit, first amidships, then gutted, with three crew and one military working party member killed. The next day the ship was again hit and became a total loss. In 2019, the ship's hull was still visible off the village of Hanubada.

Criticism =High prices for tariffs and services= The State Committee on Tariffs set unreasonable prices for heat and hot water and energy to the population, which were higher than in Moscow and other economically developed regions of the country. For example, the heat energy in the city of Moscow for the townspeople will cost 1,806.89 rubles . In Ufa, the same service, according to the resolution of the State Committee of the Republic No. 780 of December 19, 2017, for consumers of \\"BashRTS\\" Ltd of Inter RAO is 2,045.57 rubles per Gcal from July 1, 2018. The standard of living and the subsistence level in the regions are several times different, and consumers in Bashkiria pay more. Also it should be taken into account that in Moscow the possibility of a payment for the actually consumed heat is realized and Moscow residents pay on a heat meter, and in Ufa, if there are heat meters in the houses, the authorities put obstacles to the residents.

The earliest history of the Community in Indonesia dates back to the early days of the Second Caliph, when during the summer of 1925, roughly two decades prior to the Indonesian revolution, a missionary of the Community, Rahmat Ali, stepped on Indonesia's largest island, Sumatra, and established the movement with 13 devotees in Tapaktuan, in the province of Aceh. The Community has an influential history in Indonesia's religious development, yet in the modern times it has faced increasing intolerance from religious establishments in the country and physical hostilities from radical Muslim groups. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimates around 400,000 Ahmadi Muslims, spread over 542 branches across the country. History =First contact= The Three Pioneers, in their later years. From left to right: Ahmad Nurdin, Abubakar Ayub, Zaini Dahlan. The history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Indonesia begins in 1925, during the era of Dutch colonization of the Indonesian archipelago, approximately two decades prior to the Indonesian Revolution. However, contact with the Indonesian people and Ahmadi Muslims of India dates back a few years earlier. In 1922, in order to further their religious studies, three Indonesian students, Abubakar Ayyub, Ahmad Nuruddin and Zaini Dahlan, from Sumatra Tawalib, a boarding school in Sumatra, initially planned to travel to Islamic institutions in Egypt, which during that period were known for their reputation in the Muslim world. However, their teachers advised them to travel to India, which according to them was increasingly becoming a center of Islamic thought. It has been suggested that a number of Ahmadi Muslim journals and books published in India were widely circulated in South East Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, in the 1920s. Moreover, in October 1920, Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din, the leader of the splinter group Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement toured Southeast Asia where he successfully managed to win confidence among some Indonesian Muslims. He delivered a number of speeches in Surabaya and Batavia which attracted headlines in several leading newspapers. It has been postulated that this may have been the trigger for the teachers to recommend a trip to India. Ahmadi students and converts from the Dutch East Indies in the presence of the Caliph Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad On complying with their teachers advice, all three students set out separately and reunited in the north Indian city of Lucknow. Whilst in the city they began their education in Islamic studies at Madrasah Nizhamiyyah Darun Nadwah under the supervision of Abdul Bari-al Ansari. Feeling unsatisfied, and having recalled a lecture by Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din in Java, they soon set out towards his city, Lahore, over 500 miles north west of Lucknow, and encountered with members of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, which at that time had already split with the main Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, still based in Qadian. Impressed by the Ahmadi teachings under the supervision of Maulana Abdus Sattar, and on the other hand, having discovered the split of the Lahori Ahmadis, they decided to travel to Qadian. Multiple theories abound as for the justification for this move. It has been suggested that the students desired to know more about the source of the teachings of Ahmadiyya and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. However, a more popular opinion suggests that Abdus Sattar was himself convinced of the superiority of the main branch, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and was spiritually aligned to them. Soon after their arrival, the three students decided to take oath of allegiance at the hands of Caliph Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad and opted to continue their studies in Qadian. On invitation, a further 23 students from the Indonesian boarding school Sumatra Tawalib, arrived in Qadian to further pursue Islamic studies and having learnt of the Ahmadi teachings, they too converted to the Ahmadiyya movement. In 1924, the caliph toured the Middle East and Europe. Having learnt this, a number of Indonesian students, whilst still studying in Qadian, desired that their caliph should also visit the East, in particular the Indonesian archipelago. In a formal speech delivered in Arabic to the caliph, by Haji Mahmud, a spokesman for the Indonesian students in Qadian, the students expressed this very desire. The caliph, assured them that he himself will not be able to visit Indonesia but will soon send a representative, a missionary, to the region. Subsequently, in the summer of 1925, under the directive of the caliph, Rahmat Ali, a missionary of the Ahmadiyya movement, arrived in Tapaktuan, Aceh, the northern province of the Sumatra Island. With this, the foundation of the Ahmadiyya movement in Indonesia was laid. In the history of the Community, the three aforementioned students are renowned as the early pioneers of the Ahmadiyya movement in Indonesia. Through their pioneering efforts, and various missionaries of the Community, Ahmadiyya was to spread across Indonesia. =Establishment= R. Muhyiddin. First President of the Jemaat Ahmadiyah Indonesia. Died 1946. On October 2, 1925, with 13 members, under the leadership of Rahmat Ali, the first branch of the movement was established in Tapaktuan. A few months later, in 1926, Rahmat Ali moved to Padang, in the west coast of Sumatra and established the second branch of the movement. Following this, several branches of the movement were established all over the Island. In 1931, Rahmat Ali moved to Batavia (known today as Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia), in the northwest coast of Java Island. Although the Community had established a number of branches throughout the country, it was not until a conference was held in December 1935 that the organisational structure of the Community was established. R. Muhyiddin was elected as the first president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Indonesia. The Indonesian branch adopted the name Ahmadiyah Qadian Departemen Indonesia, which was later changed to Anjuman Ahmadiyah Departemen Indonesia in June 1937. In late 1949, after the Indonesian Revolution, the name was once again changed to Jemaat Ahmadiyah Indonesia (JAI), thereby emphasizing the organizational nature of the Community and its connection to the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. In a separate development, the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, which had split from the main Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in 1914, sent its first missionary Mirza Wali Ahmad Baig in 1926. Although the Lahore Ahmadiyya was established in the country on December 10, 1928, it was not legally registered in the country (as Gerakan Ahmadiyah Indonesia 'GAI') until the following September. Due to a lack of effort produced by the Lahori Ahmadis in seeking converts in Indonesia, and into the faith in general, the group failed to attract a sizeable following. In particular, Mira Wali Ahmad Baig was the last missionary of the group, in contrast to the main Ahmadiyya movement, which had sent missionary after missionary to Indonesia. Due to the organizational strength adopted in overseas missionary activity, during the era of the second Caliphate, and for various financial and theological reasons, the main Ahmadiyya branch became increasingly successful in gaining converts to their interpretation of Islam. Shielded by Indonesia's Constitution, which guaranteed religious freedom, the Ahmadi Community continued to grow, whilst facing little persecution up until the fall of the Suharto government. =Early development= An early community of Ahmadi Muslims in front of a mosque in Singaparna, Java, in the late 1920s. Discussions, lectures, and debates played a crucial role in the early progress of the Ahmadiyya movement in Indonesia. As soon as Rahmat Ali arrived in Tapaktuan, the first lecture he organized was on the death of Jesus, concerning which Ahmadi Muslims hold a distinctive theological perspective from mainstream Muslims and Christians. Many early converts to the Ahmadiyya movement are attributed to theological debates, including, but not limited to the death of Jesus. However, many conversions required more than satisfactory arguments, and it was not solely debates that attracted people. The charisma, attitude and the 'spiritual power' of the missionaries appealed to the public. The patience exemplified by the Ahmadi debaters in face of abusive criticisms and humiliation played an important role. A year later, following the arrival of Rahmat Ali, a committee Komite Mencari Hak (committee for finding the truth) was assembled by Tahar Sultan Marajo, a non-Ahmadi Muslim in the Pasar Gadang locality of Padang, western Sumatra, in order to bring Ahmadi missionaries and orthodox clerics together to debate on religious matters. However, the debate did not ensue as the clerics did not appear. According to Ahmadi reports, some of the committee members converted to Ahmadiyya. Some of the most famous debates, in the early years of the movement, between Ahmadi Muslims of Indonesia and the orthodox clergy was with Persatuan Islam, an Indonesian Islamic organization founded in 1923. The debates were commonly held in Bandung and Batavia, both of which lie in the western portion of Java. The first debate with Persatuan Islam was on the death of Jesus, attended by over a 1,000 people and lasted over three days during April 1933. A second debate discussing wider topics, was held in September of the same year, and was witnessed by over 2,000 people. Local millenarian beliefs concerning the arrival of a Ratu Adil (Just Ruler), the Imam Mahdi, and the promised Messiah were some of the pull factors that accompanied the rise of the Ahmadiyya movement in Indonesia. Before the arrival of Ahmadiyya in Cisalada, Bogor, villagers believed that a messenger of the Messiah would arrive at their village some day. Traditions from the village state that its people should follow this messenger whenever he arrives, even if he were a 'snake charmer' ‚Äì a common practice found in India. Similar beliefs in the coming of the Imam Mahdi or the promised Messiah abound in many cultures, traditions and ethnicities all over the islands of Java and Lombok. Mass conversions ensued in villages across Indonesia. =Influence= President Sukarno with two Ahmadi leaders: President of Jemaat Ahmadiyah Indonesia and a missionary, at the Presidential Palace, 1950. Reports by Ahmadi Muslim missionaries and as well as analysts suggest that Ahmadiyya literature on Christianity had helped reinforce confidence among the mainstream Muslim populace in the Islamic religion, particularly when facing Christian missionary activity. With a few exceptions, no Indonesian literature provided a critical analysis of Christianity and other religions other than that of Ahmadiyya. In contrast to the main Ahmadiyya movement, the small Lahore Ahmadiyya group focused translations of Ahmadiyya literature into Dutch, the language of the Indonesian intelligentsia of that period. With reference to the Ahmadiyya missionary activity, President Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia following independence, is purported to have said: According to B.J. Boland, the apologetic and polemic characteristic of Ahmadiyya literature has become a guide and inspiration for Muslim organizations across Indonesia that deal with missionary activities. Although Indonesian Sunni clerics hold this fact from public for fear of arousing resistance, some do recognize that their references come from Ahmadiyya literature. Some consider the Ahmadi apologetic method justifiable in dealing with Christian influence in the country, particularly during the early decades of Indonesian independence, because Christian missionaries heavily preached their religion in the midst of a Muslim-majority society. Ahmadiyya literature provided an effective tool for defending Islam against Christian allegations, whilst creating an atmosphere of Islamic superiority. Nevertheless, after Indonesia became increasingly stable, following a fall in Christian missionary activity, the mainstream Sunni preachers began to increasingly neglect Ahmadiyya literature, giving rise to persecution. Demographics According to various independent estimates, the number of Ahmadi Muslims range from 200,000 to 500,000 members, spread over 542 branches across Indonesia. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimates around 400,000 Ahmadi Muslims in the country. There are an estimated 289 Ahmadi mosques and an estimated 110 mission houses. In contrast to independent estimates, the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs estimates around 80,000 members in the country, The Lahore Ahmadiyya movement, also known as Gerakan Ahmadiyyah Indonesia (GAI) in Indonesia, had only 400 members up until the 1940s. Due to a lack of effort produced by the Lahori Ahmadis in seeking converts in Indonesia, and into the faith in general, the group failed to attract a sizeable following. By the 1970s the group's membership stood between 500 and 1000 people. In the 1980s, it fell to 708 members. Persecution =Rise of intolerance= Since the earliest days of the Ahmadiyya Islamic movement in Indonesia numerous fatwas have been issued by Indonesian religious organizations. One of the earliest to issue a fatwa was the Sunni Indonesian movement Muhammadiyah, which issued its fatwa in 1929, declaring anyone who does not believe in the finality of Muhammad as infidel. Although the fatwa does not explicitly mention Ahmadiyya, nor Ahmadi Muslims, it is believed that it was directed at the Ahmadiyya movement. It is to be noted however that Muhammadiyah initially maintained cordial relations with the small Lahore Ahmadiyya group, so much so that it was rumoured that the two groups were going to merge. In 1935, local members of the Indonesian Ulema Council in East Sumatra issued their first warning of the 'heretical' status of the Ahmadiyya. However it was not until 1965 that this position was formalized through a fatwa. Having produced little influence, the national body of the Indonesian Ulema Council took up the issue and in 1980 issued its first fatwa against the Ahmadiyya movement, although it excluded the splinter Lahore Ahmadiyya group from this ordeal. It declared Ahmadi Muslims outside the pale of Islam, \\"deviant\\" and that the government is to give ear to the Council in its dealings with Ahmadi Muslims. As a result, the Ministry of Religious Affairs issued a statement declaring the Ahmadiyya movement as a 'deviant' sect. However the New Order government of the second President of Indonesia, Suharto, gave little support in the implementation of the final part of the fatwa through actual state policy. With the fundamentalist Islamist organizations still unsatisfied, the Indonesian Ulema Council were pressured to issue another fatwa 25 years later, in July 2005. This time, the council additionally charged Ahmadi Muslims of apostasy. The fatwa, entitled Aliran Ahmadiyah (Ahmadiyya branch), cited a 1985 fatwa by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on Ahmadi Muslims and placed itself above the Indonesian government with respect to its treatment towards Ahmadi Muslims. It demanded that the fatwa be enforced. The fatwa ordered the government to impede the spread of Ahmadi teachings among the Muslim populations, suspend the organizational activity of the movement and seal off all public Ahmadi buildings, such as mosques. This fatwa, accompanied with the fall of the Suharto government a few years back in 1998, played a pivotal role in providing ideological justification and an open platform for the opposition and the persecution of Ahmadi Muslims all over the country. In the Post- Suharto era, the Yudhoyono government has generally overlooked the hostilities by radical Muslim groups against Ahmadi Muslims. In June 2017, there were reports by human right groups stating that the government refused issue to Ahmadi Muslims state ID cards unless they renounce their belief. =Violence against Ahmadis= With violence and large demonstrations, in 2008, many Muslims in Indonesia protested against Ahmadi Muslims. The religious conservatives placed pressure on the government to monitor, and harass the Community. An Ahmadi Muslim mosque was burned. Public opinion in Indonesia is split in three ways on how Ahmadi Muslims should be treated. Some hold the view that it should be banned outright on the basis that it is a 'heretical' and 'deviant' sect, not listed as one of the officially recognised religions in Indonesia; while others hold the view that although it should not be banned because of the guarantee of religious freedom in the constitution, its proselytism under the banner of \\"Islam\\" should be curtailed, on the basis that it is misleading. Still others hold the view that the Community should be given total religious freedom based on the constitutional right to freedom of religion. As a consequence of the upheaval, the curtailment of religious freedom against Ahmadi Muslims was institutionalized following a Join Ministerial Decree. The decree issued by the Minister for Religious Affairs, the Minister of Interior and the Attorney General, curtails proselytizing activities of Ahmadi Muslims. Indonesians, who violate the decree may be subject to up to 5 years of imprisonment. Human rights groups objected to the restrictions on the grounds of religious freedom. In July 2010, a mob of 200 Indonesians surrounded an Ahmadi mosque in Manislor village in Kuningan district, in the province of West Java. The mob pelted the mosque with stones before being dispersed by the police. In 2011, the sect faced widespread calls for a \\"total ban\\" in Indonesia. On February 6, 2011, 1,500 of radical Muslim rioters surrounded an Ahmadi neighbourhood in Cikeusik, Banten province and beat to death 3 Ahmadi Muslims and injuring 5, while several other Ahmadi Muslims managed to evacuate their homes and ran for their life. Footage of the bludgeoning of their naked bodies, while policemen watched on, was posted on YouTube and subsequently broadcast on international media, gaining widespread public attention. Those that managed to escape were pursued by the mob, shouting \\"kill,kill\\" whilst throwing rocks at the escaping victims. The Wahid Institute held President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono responsible for not taking action against interreligious violence: \\"Violence against Ahmadis is an almost daily occurrence, yet the President does nothing to address this.\\" To the surprise of human rights groups, Judges at Serang District court sentenced an Ahmadi victim to six month imprisonment of the Cikeusik attack, for not obeying the police to \\"leave the house.\\" In contrast to this, the verdict given to the leading attackers, who murdered 3 Ahmadi Muslims, were given between three and six months. This triggered outcry from human right defenders and the international community including the United States and the European Union. In early 2013, city officials sealed the Al-Misbah Mosque in Bekasi near Jakarta three times. In April 2014, the Indonesian Ulema Council of Ciamis in West Java asked the local Ahmadiyya community to cease activity at the Khilafat Nur Mosque after police warned from possible attacks following the legislative election. This was rejected by the Ahmadiyya community insisting on the state being responsible for guaranteeing religious freedom for its citizens. The Wahid Institute reaffirmed the Ahmadiyya's stance warning the government not to take the wrong action. =Forced segregation= In Cisalada, a village south of Jakarta marks a sign which says that it is \\"forbidden for [an] Ahmadi to use this road,\\" an example of segregation of Ahmadi Muslims from the Muslim majority. Following the terrible attacks on Ahmadis in Cikeusik, Banten province, an Indonesian politician once suggested that Ahmadis should be moved to one of thousands of Indonesia's uninhabited islands, in order to prevent conflicts between Ahmadi Muslims and Muslim conservatives. He stated, \\"We [can] choose [to place them] on an island so that they will have decent lives.\\" See also * Islam in Indonesia * Christianity in Indonesia * Persecution of Ahmadis References Further reading  * * Indonesia Category:Islam in Indonesia ","title":"Ahmadiyya in Indonesia"},{"id":"28254598","text":"Hypselodoris whitei is a colourful species of sea slug or dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae.

They were created by Mattel designer Bill Greening and were introduced in late 2009 to be officially released in the spring of 2010. From their name, the dolls are dressed in \\"basic\\" clothing that women usually have in their closets. The debut collection featured the best-known fashion staple: the little black dress. Description The dolls have the so-called collector-only ModelMuse body sculpt (which is thinner than most Barbie bodies and has impressive details including neck and collarbone sculpting). The posing of the arms varies from doll to doll and some have different stances. All the dolls also have differing head molds, skin tones and ethnicities. The male dolls introduced in Collection 002 feature the MaleMuse body created for the Twilight Edward Cullen doll in 2009. In Collection 002.5, female Basics dolls featured an articulated ModelMuse body. The dolls are part of the Black Label collection which, unlike some Barbie lines, is for adult collectors only (the minimum age limit is 14). The first collection (Collection 001) featured 12 dolls wearing different little black dresses and 4 accessory packs (which were sold separately). The second wave of the collection (called Collection 001.5) only featured 4 dolls (though one of them featured a new face sculpt) and showcased little black dresses with pink ribbon accents, along with another 2 new accessory packs. The third wave (Collection Red) was a Target store exclusive which featured 3 dolls wearing little red dresses and a new accessory pack. Collection 002 debuted in the spring of 2011. In the collection, there are 12 dolls (9 Barbies and 3 Kens) and the theme is jeans and T-shirts. Collection 002.5 was announced to collectors in February 2011 and featured three dolls and two accessory sets. These dolls feature an articulated body, a first for the Basics line. The dolls are dressed in jeans with metallic-finish blouses and earrings. A second version of Collection Red (called 'Collection Red 2') was released with 1 new accessory pack and 3 dolls wearing red shirts and white jeans. Collection 003, the third and final collection, debuted in the spring of 2012. There are 6 dolls and 2 new accessory packs and the theme is colorful swimsuits.

The featured dolls do not have names, but are numbered instead. Each of the dolls has a different head mold (corresponding to their model number). Some of the molds are popularly used in the Barbie Collector line. Mattel's head molds are usually, but not always, named after the doll/character/line in which they debuted. * \\"Model No. 1\\" has pale skin and bleached blond hair in Collection 001, Collection Red and Collection Red 2. She then appeared as a raven-haired brunette in Collection 001.5. She also reappeared in Collection 002 with sandy blond hair and a tanner skin tone. She uses the Mackie head mold (which was exclusively created for Bob Mackie's limited-edition Barbie dolls since 1991). Her head mold is by far the most popular of all the molds in the line and has been frequently used for the character of Barbie for both the main and collector lines since its creation. * \\"Model No. 2\\" has peach skin and long chestnut brown hair in Collection 001. She reappears in Collection 002 with the same overall look but with shorter hair. She becomes an African-American doll in Collection Red 2 with light-brown curly hair. She is totally revamped in Collection 003, where she has wine-red hair and the same skin tone as in Collection 001. She uses the Lara head mold, which is frequently used for the collector line's designer Barbie dolls (e.g. the Versace, Vera Wang, Juicy Couture, and Diane von F√ºrstenberg dolls). The head mold was named after Lara, one of Barbie's friends from the Generation Girl line back in 1999. * \\"Model No. 3\\" has peach skin and long auburn hair in Collection 001 and Collection Red. She then appeared with curly red hair in Collection 001.5. In Collection 002, her whole look is revamped and she has pale skin and curly blond hair. In Collection Red 2, she has long black hair in a ponytail. She uses the Steffie head mold which is, by far, the oldest face sculpt in the line. It was first used for Barbie's friend Steffie back in 1971 (thus gaining its name). Other notable characters who used the head mold are Whitney, PJ, Midge and Summer. * \\"Model No. 4\\" has cropped curly black hair and has the darkest skin tone in Collection 001. She is totally revamped in Collection 002, where she has tan skin and long red hair. She is featured in Collection 002.5, with a light tan skin tone and dark brown hair. She is, again, revamped in Collection 003, where she has tan skin and long golden-blond hair. She uses the Goddess (a.k.a. Angel) head mold which was first used on the Fantasy Goddess of Africa doll from the Bob Mackie International Beauty Collection in 1999 and for the Classical Goddess line of dolls in 2000. * \\"Model No. 5\\" is an East Asian doll with long black hair in Collection 001 and Collection 002 (she sported bangs in the latter collection). She is featured with the same look in Collection 003, though donning a short bob. She uses the Kayla/Lea head mold, which was named after two of Barbie's friends of the same name. This popular head mold has been frequently used for Barbie's ethnic Asian friends in the main line as well as for several Asian-themed dolls in the collector line. * \\"Model No. 6\\" has tan skin and long golden-blond hair in both Collection 001 and Collection 001.5. Her head mold was first used for the LeAnn Rimes doll in 2003 and for the David's Bridal Eternal doll in 2004. Despite this, the head mold is named Carnaval after the 2006 Carnaval Barbie doll from the Dolls of the World line. Mattel calls it the BeBe sculpt. * \\"Model No. 7\\" has peach skin and long ginger hair in Collection 001. She reappeared in Collection 002 with warm brown hair and the same skin tone. She is totally revamped in Collection 003 where she has pale skin and platinum-blond hair. She uses the Aphrodite head mold which was first used for the 2009 Aphrodite Barbie doll (though the head mold is sometimes called the Kentucky, since it was used for the Kentucky Derby Barbie doll, released a bit earlier than the Aphrodite). The head mold was, allegedly, made from the Mackie face (upper part) and the Lara face (lips). * \\"Model No. 8\\" is an African-American doll with long light-brown hair in Collection 001 and Collection Red (she sported a short Afro in the latter collection).

In Collection 003, she sports a dark Afro and a slightly darker skin tone compared to her previous versions. She uses the Mbili head mold.

Her head mold was first used for the annual 2002 Barbie (African-American version) and for several African-American dolls a few years later. It was officially named the Desiree (a.k.a. Adria) face sculpt after Barbie's friend of the same name in the Fashion Fever line in 2005. The head mold is currently used for African-American friends in the main line such as Artsy and Nikki. * \\"Model No. 11\\" has olive skin and a short brunette bob in Collection 001.

He is one of the three Ken dolls in Collection 002. His head mold was first used for the character of Edward Cullen in the Twilight films' series of dolls by Mattel.

He uses an all-new head sculpt never before used by Mattel, dubbed by collectors as the New Basic.'' Controversy One of the dolls, Model No. 10, gained controversy for her stock dress (which had a v-neck with a plunging neckline). Several parents complained and the matter was even covered by news and media. Despite the parents' pleas for the removal of the doll from the shelves, retail stores such as Wal-Mart and Toys \\"R\\" Us argued that they would continue to sell the dolls since the line is aimed toward adult collectors and is not for children. Since the incident, versions of Model No. 10's dress have borne a shorter v-neck or a completely round neckline. Promotion The Barbie Basics was the first doll line (and retail product) to bear the logo of the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) on their boxes. The line was officially approved by the CFDA and several of its members have even quoted about the line in the official Barbie Basics website. A special production of Barbie dolls was produced from 1980‚Äì1982. One look was introduced with a classic Barbie doll dressed out with Nike white shoes. A production run of 200 Barbie dolls were sold to retailers in Florida and Georgia test markets. Limited quantities are known to be highly sought after and is a rare collectable among collectors. In 1994, a 1982 Barbie doll sold at auction for $12,000. In late January 2010, Mattel officially released 12 one-of-a-kind dolls made by several designers who were members of the CFDA. These were Models No. 1 to 12 as designed by 12 different designers. The designers were: Rachel Roy, Tory Burch, Albertus Swanepoel, Phillip Crangi, Kate Spade (represented by Deborah Lloyd), Monica Botkier, Betsey Johnson, Isaac Mizrahi, Alexis Bittar, Lorraine Schwartz, Justin Guinta for Subversive Jewelry, and Devi Kroell. The one-of-a-kind dolls were auctioned in eBay and all of the proceeds went to various charities and foundations sponsored by the CFDA. To promote the line in Australia, Mattel enlisted renowned Australian jeweler Stefano Canturi to create a one-of-a-kind doll. Canturi collaborated with the Barbie design team to create the world's most expensive Barbie doll. Valued at A$600,000, the doll debuted in Sydney, Australia in conjunction to the Australian Fashion Week. The doll was decorated with a diamond choker with a rare pink diamond as its centerpiece.

It is located on the main artery of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Piotrkowska Street, next to the W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont Park.  History  The idea to establish an open-air museum detailing wooden architecture of the area came from Krystyna Kondratiukowa, the first director and the founder of the Central Museum of Textiles. This idea was not realized until 2002, when two architects, Anita Luniak and Teresa Mromli≈Ñska, won a tender for the design. The museum was under construction from September 2006 until May 2008, and was finally open for visitors in September 2008.  Exposition  The collected objects are typical representatives of architecture in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ at the turn of the 19th-20th century. These specimens include a church (transported from Nowosolna), a summer villa (transported from Ruda Pabianicka), a one-storey house for workers (from Mazowiecka Street), a wooden tram-stop (from Zgierz) and four craftsman's houses (from ≈ªeromskiego, Mazowiecka and Kopernika Streets). Additional elements such as lamps, wells, signs with street names, complete the reconstruction of life at that time.

The church is one of two Church of England churches in Armley; the other being Christ Church. Worship at St Bartholomew's is firmly rooted in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England with a solemn mass being celebrated weekly. History The first chapel at Armley was built in 1630 but not consecrated by Richard Sterne, Archbishop of York, until 1674. In 1737 it was extended to the north, the roof was raised and a small balcony was added at the west end. In 1825 the chapel was much enlarged through the benevolence of Benjamin Gott, a local industrial businessman with woollen mills in Leeds. A new church was built starting in 1872 to designs by the architects Henry Walker and Joseph Althron of Leeds, and is now a Grade II* listed building. It was consecrated in 1877 but the tower was not dedicated until 1904. The church is constructed of Horsforth sandstone. The old chapel was demolished in 1909. =List of vicars= *Frederick George Hume Smith *David Hartley *James Buchanan Seaton 1905‚Äì1909 (later Bishop of Wakefield) *Ralph Creed Meredith 1914‚Äì1917 (later Vicar of Windsor, 1940‚Äì1958, and Chaplain to George VI and Elizabeth II, 1946‚Äì1952) *Herbert Lovell Clarke 1923‚Äì1933 (previously vicar of All Saints' Church, Nottingham) *William Johnston (later Bishop of Dunwich) *Norman Ernest (Norry) McCurry 1963‚Äì1973 *Owen Conway - late 1970s *Nicholas Plant *Timothy Lipscomb *Ian Wright *Charles Clapham, of Trinity College Cambridge, perpetual curate from 1822 until his death in 1848.The Gentleman's Magazine (London, England), Volume 184, p.326 See also references to him as incumbent of Armley in 1828,Pigot and co.'s national commercial directory for 1828-9, comprising a directory of the merchants, bankers, professional gentleman [&c.;] in the counties of Cheshire, Cumberland.

John Wormald Appleyard was present at the consecration on 24 August 1877, listed alongside the architects Henry Walker and Joseph Athron who designed the building and reredos. Since no other stone carver is credited for this work, it is reasonable to suppose that it could be the work of Appleyard. The pulpit is of alabaster and marble, designed by architect Thomas Armfield after the pulpit at the shrine of Sebaldus in St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremberg. It was carved originally by Mawer and Ingle for the former St Bartholomew's Church, on the occasion of its 1861 restoration, then moved along with the font and the old tomb memorials to the new building after the consecration. There is a sculpture by Joseph Gott at the west end of the north aisle, a memorial to Benjamin Gott of Armley House who died in 1839. In the south aisle there is Faith comforting the Mourner, commemorating the two sons of Benjamin and Elizabeth Gott who died in Paris and Athens. Organ The organ The church is perhaps best known for its organ. It was built by the German builder Edmund Schulze.The organ: a guide to its construction, history, usage and music. David Baker, Osprey Publishing, 2003 It was originally installed in Meanwood Towers in 1869. In 1877 it was inaugurated in St. Peter's Church, Harrogate. Following a dispute with the vicar, the organ was installed in St. Bartholomew‚Äôs in 1879. It was rebuilt in 1905 by James Jepson Binns and other restoration work took place in 1956 by Hill, Norman and Beard, 1974 by John T. Jackson and Son and 2004 by Harrison & Harrison.

As a collection of settler nations, the contemporary Caribbean has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of customs, cuisine, and traditions that have marked the socio-cultural development of the area. Development of Caribbean culture Caribbean culture results from Caribbean history and geography. Most of the Caribbean territories were inhabited and developed earlier than European colonies (1492- ) in the Americas, with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers, farmers, traders and slaves became important in the early development of Caribbean culture. British conquests in the Caribbean in 1759 brought a Francophone population under British rule, requiring compromise and accommodation, while in the 1780s the migration of United Empire Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies For example: brought in strong British, Spanish, French, African and even Dutch influences. Although not without conflict, the Caribbean's early interactions between incoming settlers and the indigenous populations were relatively short-lived, compared to the experience of native peoples in (say) the United States or Brazil. Combined with relatively late economic development in many regions, this difficult history has disallowed Caribbean native peoples from having any strong influence on emergent national cultures, even destroying their remaining identity. Compare for example: Multicultural heritage is enshrined in many islands. In parts of the Caribbean, multiculturalism itself is the cultural norm and diversity is the force that unites the community. Although officially a quarter of the Caribbean population is English-speaking, the largest linguistic group comprises Spanish speakers (due to the inclusion of mainland Caribbean states), some 22% speak French while only 1% speak Dutch. Though the Caribbean today features 59 living languagesPaul, L. M. (ed.), Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 16th edn, Dallas, Texas (2009). these are not spoken in the \\"insular Caribbean\\", but on what is referred to as the \\"continental Caribbean\\". In the French islands, cultural identity is strong, and many French-speaking islanders commentators speak of a French culture as distinguished from English Caribbean culture, but some also see the Caribbean as a collection of several regional, and ethnic subcultures. While French Caribbean culture is the most obvious example, Spanish influences have allowed the survival of non-English dialects. The influence of Ulster immigrants to Barbados had the effect of minimizing Irish influences in the Caribbean's culture, and highlighting British influences instead, until the 1980s. The Caribbean's Pacific trade has also brought a large Chinese influence into Trinidad and other areas.Aceto, Michael, and Jeffrey P. Williams (eds), Contact Englishes of the Eastern Caribbean, Varieties of English around the World, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 2003.Solomon, Denis, The Speech of Trinidad: A Reference Grammar, St. Augustine: School of Continuing Studies, University of the West Indies (1993).Corne, C., From French to Creole: The Development of New Vernaculars in the French Colonial World, London: University of Westminster Press (1999).McWhorter, J. H., The Missing Spanish Creoles: Recovering the Birth of Plantation Contact, Los Angeles: University of California Press (2000).Allsopp, R., Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage, with a French and Spanish Supplement, Oxford: Oxford University Press (1996). The East Indians brought to Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, and other parts of the Caribbean as indentured laborers to work on the sugarcane, rice, and cocoa estates brought with them the many languages of India and developed a lingua franca: Caribbean Hindustani. =Caribbean identity= palm is the symbol most associated with Caribbean identity. Major influences on Caribbean identity trace back to the arrival of French settlers (from the early-17th century), English settlers (from the early-17th century) and Spanish settlers (from the late-15th century). Indigenous people played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Caribbean, from their role in assisting exploration, the development of the sugar trade and inter-European power struggles to the formation of the Afro-Caribbean people. Through their art and culture, indigenous Caribbean and African descendants continue to exert influence on the Caribbean identity. With the gradual loosening of political and cultural ties to the United Kingdom, in the 20th century immigrants from European, African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have shaped Caribbean identity, a process that continues today with the arrival of significant numbers of immigrants from non-British or French backgrounds, adding the theme of multiculturalism to the debate. the Caribbean has a diverse makeup of nationalities and cultures and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than a single national myth. Agostino Brunias. Free Women of Color with Their Children and Servants in a Landscape, ca. 1770-1796 Brooklyn Museum The issue of Caribbean identity remains under scrutiny. In true Caribbean fashion, however, even the search for an identity has itself become an object for self- criticism, usually because many Caribbean people confuse reasons for ridding themselves of colonial shackles and compounding the loss of their own Caribbean identity by clinging to an African non-identity in its stead (unnecessary contentious statement).Trouillot, Michel-Rolph \\"The Caribbean Region: An Open Frontier in Anthropological Theory,\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 21 (1992).Premdas, R. and Williams, H., \\"Self-Determination and Secession in the Caribbean: The Case of Tobago\\", Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism (1992). Cultural protectionism in Caribbean Cultural protectionism in the Caribbean has, since the mid-20th century, taken the form of conscious, interventionist attempts on the part of various Caribbean governments to promote Caribbean cultural production and limit the effect of foreign, largely American, culture on the domestic audience. Sharing a large border and (for the majority) a common language with the United States, the Caribbean faces a difficult position in regard to American culture, be it direct attempts at the Caribbean market or the general diffusion of American culture in the globalized media arena. While the Caribbean people try to maintain their cultural differences, they must also balance this with responsibility in trade arrangements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Richardson, B. C., The Caribbean in the Wider World 1492‚Äì1992, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1992).Knight, F. W., and C. A. Palmer, \\"The Caribbean\\" in The Modern Caribbean, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press (1989).Lowenthal, David, West Indian Societies, Oxford: Oxford University Press (1972).Premdas, R. R., \\"The Anatomy of Ethnic Conflict\\" in The Enigma of Ethnicity: An Analysis of Race and Ethnicity in the Caribbean and the World, Trinidad: University of the West Indies Press (1993). Symbols Official symbols of the Caribbean include the parrot, palm, and the shell. Many official symbols of the country such as the flags of the Caribbean have been changed or modified over the past years in order to \\"Caribbeanize\\" them and de-emphasise or remove references to the United Kingdom. For example, The Cayman Islands now uses National Symbols that include their indigenous Parrot, Silver Thatch, Palm and the Wild Banana Orchid. Arts The works of most early Caribbean painters followed European trends. During the mid-1800s, Caribbean painters have developed a wide range of highly individual styles. The arts have flourished in Caribbean since the 1900s, and especially since the end of World War II in 1945. The Washington Organization of American States (inaugurated in 1976) houses one of the oldest 20th-century art collections representing the Caribbean. For example, one exhibit showcased works included two important pieces by women artists of the Caribbean: El vendedor de andullo (Tobacco Vendor), 1938, by modernist Celeste Woss y Gil of the Dominican Republic, and an oil painting entitled Marpac√≠fico (Hibiscus-Marpac√≠fico is the name used in Cuba for the hibiscus flower), 1943, by Cuban modernist Amelia Pel√°ez. There have even been a rare selection of prints by Haitian artists such as Castera Bazile, Wilson Bigaud, Dieudonn√© Cedor, Jacques-Enguerrand Gourgue and Gabriel L√©v√™que, that have not been exhibited since they were part of a traveling exhibition in 1948. =Literature= Caribbean literature, whether written in English, French, Spanish, or a creole language, often reflects a Caribbean perspective on nature, life, and the region's position in the world. Caribbean identity is closely tied to its literature. Caribbean literature is often categorized by region or island; by the status of the author (e.g., literature of Caribbean women, Europeans, Asian peoples, and Irish Caribbeans); and by literary period, such as \\"Caribbean postmoderns\\" or \\"Caribbean Poets Between the Wars\\". The East Indians have preserved their Indian literature and brought religious Hindu texts such as the Itihasa (Ramayana, Mahabharta, Bhagavad Gita), Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, Tirumurai, Naalayira Divya Prabhandham, Shastras, Sutras. The Sikhs also brought their Guru Granth Sahib with them. The Muslims also brought their Quran with them. Caribbean authors have won numerous awards. Mark McWatt won Best First Book Award (2006) and Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Suspended Sentences: Fictions of Atonement. Sir V. S. Naipaul won the Man Booker Prize (1971), the Trinity Cross of Trinidad and Tobago, and the Nobel Prize in Literature (2001). Derek Walcott also won the Nobel Prize (1992).

Traditionally, most Caribbean islands celebrate carnival on Ash Wednesday or the days leading up to Lent. =Music= The music of the Caribbean reflects the multi-cultural influences that have shaped the Caribbean and these are mainly African. The first historical figures to influence Caribbean musicians were from the South Americas and to some degree Africa. Nevertheless, the Caribbean's first peoples, the East Indias, the Chinese, the Arabs, the Jews, the Spanish, the French, the British, the Portuguese, the Danish, the Dutch, Germans, and the Italians have all made large contributions to the musical heritage of Caribbean as well. Since Spanish explorer Columbus arrived and established the permanent colonies, the islands have produced their own composers, musicians and ensembles. From the 17th century onwards, the Caribbean has developed a music infrastructure that includes church halls, performing arts centers, record companies, radio stations and television music video channels. The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture because of its proximity and migration between the two regions. The Caribbean has produced a variety of internationally successful performers and artists. These individuals are honoured at The Awards, recognizing Caribbean achievement in popular music. In addition, the Caribbean is home to a number of popular summertime folk festivals. The Caribbean has also produced many notable composers, who have contributed in a variety of ways to the history of Western classical music. The Caribbean is home to the Indo-Caribbean musical form of Chutney. It was created in Trinidad and Tobago by Sundar Popo. The Caribbean is also home to the Indo-Caribbean musical form of Baithak Gana that originated in Suriname. There are the Anthony N Sabga Caribbean Awards for Excellence (ANSCAFE) launched in October 2005 to awards in the Arts (and other areas). Up to 2010, they were made biennially, but as of 2011, the awards will be made yearly in ceremonies in Trinidad. Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham (late President of Guyana) facilitated the first Caribbean Festival of the Arts (CARIFESTA) in 1972 in Georgetown, Guyana. =Caribbean theatre= The Caribbean has a thriving stage theatre scene. Judy Stone writes: \\"In addition to the conventional drama of social realism and the yard theatre, the range includes popular farce and roots theatre, musical folk theatre, pantomime, community theatre, Jamaica's Gun Court theatre, political theatre, church theatre, children's theatre, storytelling, the street theatre of Carnival and carnival theatre, calypso theatre, theatre of ritual, and the poetic theatre of St Lucia's Derek Walcott. There is also a considerable body of dramatic work written for film, television and radio. Cuba, in particular, has a comparatively vibrant film industry.\\"Judy S. J. Stone, \\"Caribbean drama\\", in Colin Chambers (ed.), The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre (London, 2002). Retrieved from Drama Online. Theatre festivals draw many tourists in the tourist months. As an example - RuprechtRuprecht, Alvina, Les Theatres Francophones et Creolophones de la Caraibe. Paris: L‚ÄôHarmattan (2003). argues that Creole Theatre would take one on a tour to a chain of islands in the Caribbean, and he offers an analysis of the contemporary Creole theatre of the Caribbean and of the work of some of the playwrights associated with Creole theatre, such as Frank√©tienne and Cav√© in Haiti, Jos√© Ex√©lis and Arthur L√©rus in Guadeloupe, as well as Boukman and Placoly of Martinique.Corsbie, Ken, Theatre in the Caribbean, London: Hodder & Stoughton, 60 pp. (1984).Banham, M., E. Hill, and G. W. Woodward, The Cambridge Guide to African and Caribbean Theatre, Cambridge: University Press, 261 pp. (1994). The Trinidad Theatre Workshop (established in 1959).Omotoso, Kole, The Theatrical into Theatre: A Study of the Drama and Theatre in the English- speaking Caribbean, London (1982). =Film and television= The Caribbean film market was dominated by the American film industry for decades, although that film industry has since inception seen a prominent role for actors, directors, producers and technicians of Caribbean origin. Filmmakers from the Caribbean began to challenge Hollywood by making innovative and relevant documentary, dramas and feature films. Some Caribbean islands have developed a small but vigorous film industry that has produced a variety of well-known films, actors, and auteurs. Also, the distinct French-Caribbean and Spanish- Caribbean society permits the work of directors to contribute very different film-forms. Some have become the Caribbean's first films to win the Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Many Caribbean people are employed in the film industry, and celebrity-spotting is frequent throughout many Caribbean cities. Caribbean television, especially supported by the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation, is the home of a variety of locally produced shows. French- and Spanish-language television, is buffered from excessive American influence by the fact of language, and likewise supports a host of home-grown productions. The success of French and Spanish-language domestic television and movies in Caribbean often exceeds that of its English-language counterpart. Caribbean Media Awards honor the best feature broadcast placements, print and photography from Caribbean-based media outlets. Caribbean humour Caribbean humour is an integral part of the Caribbean identity. There are several traditions in Caribbean humour in English, Spanish and French. While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Caribbeans' shared history and geopolitical situation in North America and the world. Various trends can be noted in Caribbean comedy. One trend is the portrayal of a \\"typical\\" Caribbean family in an ongoing radio or television series. Examples include a mix of drama, humour, politics, religion, and sitcoms. Another major trend tends to be political and cultural satire: television shows such as Royal Palm Estate, monologuists and writers, draw their inspiration from Caribbean society and politics. Another trend revels in absurdity and musician-comedians. Satire is arguably the primary characteristic of Caribbean humour, evident in each of these threads, and uniting various genres and regional cultural differences. Caribbean humour has taken on a modern interpretation, due to the advent of social media and the rise of many popular comedians that hail from the Caribbean and the Caribbean diaspora. In 1957, mento artist Lord Flea stated that: \\"West Indians have the best sense of humor in the world. Even the most solemn song, like 'Las Kean Fine' ('Lost and Can Not Be Found'), which tells of a boiler explosion on a sugar plantation that killed several of the workers, their natural wit and humor shine though.\\" Sport Association Football (Soccer) is the most popular sport in almost all Caribbean countries. Cricket is a very popular sport in the countries and dependencies that formed the British West Indies. The West Indies cricket team competes in Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The West Indies' major domestic competitions are the Regional Four Day Competition (first-class) and the Regional Super50 (List A one-day) and more recently the Caribbean Premier League (Twenty20). The regional football governing body is the Caribbean Football Union. National teams have competed in the CFU Championship from 1978 to 1988 and the Caribbean Cup since 1989. The top 4 teams in the tournament qualify for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. Cuba qualified to the FIFA World Cup in 1938, Haiti in 1974, Jamaica in 1998 and Trinidad and Tobago in 2006. The CFU Club Championship is the regional tournament for football clubs. The winner qualified for the CONCACAF Champions' Cup from 1997 until 2008. Since 2008-09, the top 3 clubs qualify for a preliminary round of the CONCACAF Champions League. However, the most popular sport in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands Antilles is baseball. The Caribbean Series, held since 1949, features the national champions from the top Caribbean leagues. The Cuban national team has claimed the Baseball World Cup 25 times, whereas the Dominican Republic won the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In the Pan American Games, Cuba has won 12 editions and Dominican Republic once, whereas Puerto Rico earned the silver medal twice. In the Central American and Caribbean Games, Cuba has won 15 gold medals, whereas Dominican Republic has won three and Puerto Rico two. Several Caribbean players have joined the Major League Baseball: in the 2014 there were 82 Dominicans, 19 Cubans and 11 Puerto Ricans. Notable Caribbean players are Juan Marichal, Pedro Mart√≠nez, Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar. The Puerto Rico men's national basketball team finished fourth in the 1990 FIBA World Championship and won three FIBA Americas Championships and two Pan American Games. Meanwhile, the Cuba women's national basketball team finished third in the 1990 FIBA World Championship for Women and won three FIBA Americas Championships and three Pan American Games. Other popular team sports in the Caribbean include rugby union and softball. Popular individual sports include auto racing, boxing, cycling, golf, hiking, horse racing, skateboarding, swimming, tennis, triathlon, track and field, water sports, and wrestling. Cuba ranks second in Olympic boxing and fifth in judo, whereas Jamaica has been a power in Olympic sprint running. At the Pan American Games, Cuba ranks second in the medal table, Dominican Republic ranks 10th, Puerto Rico 11th and Jamaica 13th. At the Central American and Caribbean Games, Cuba ranks first, Puerto Rico fifth, Dominican Republic sixth, Jamaica seventh and Trinidad and Tobago 11th. The 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Kingston, Jamaica. As an area with a generally warm climate, the Caribbean countries have enjoyed greater success at the Summer Olympics than at the Winter Olympics. However, the Jamaica national bobsleigh team has qualified to the Winter Olympic Games since 1988. Other notable Caribbean competitors at the Winter Games are Erroll Fraser, Dow Travers, George Tucker and Anne Abernathy. The Caribbean Awards Sports Icons (CASI) are based on accomplishments made over the last 60 years (1948‚Äì2008), for those who have made their mark in the various fields of sports. Great achievements in Caribbean sport are recognized by Caribbean's Sports Hall of Fame, while trophies are awarded annually to top athletes by a panel of journalists. Food Popular dishes in the Caribbean reflect the cultures that have influenced the region - Indigenous, African, European, Indian, and Chinese. One dish common to many Caribbean countries is pelau, a mixture of saltfish, beef, rice and peas, pigeon peas, and other vegetables. A prominent African-influenced Caribbean dish, callaloo, combines leafy greens with okra.

It is a common practice to attach shock indicators to expensive goods that are to be shipped. This way, the magnitude and the time of shocks are recorded to ensure that delicate and expensive instruments are not mishandled or exposed to inappropriate environmental conditions during shipping. The shock indicator provides a visual indication whether the shock threshold has been reached or exceeded, e.g. in the form of a broken spring or a digital display. The shock indicator was invented to ensure safe shipment of expensive goods and to hold the right people liable for damage. As with other inventions, it has undergone various stages of development. The earliest shock indicators were simple mechanical devices with a spring-load assembly. Newer ones come integrated with a complex set of electronic circuits that detect, measure and record shocks. Many companies make these indicators and conduct active research. Spring-load assembly Hooke's law describes how far the spring will stretch with a specific force Spring-load type shock indicators involve a simple extensible spring with a load attached to one end. Small shocks cause only temporary excursions of the load from its resting position following Hooke's law. A shock strong enough to stretch the spring beyond its elastic limit will lead to an irreversible deformation of the spring, thus providing a permanent indication that such a shock was experienced by the system. The critical acceleration at which the elastic limit is reached can be tuned by carefully choosing the material and shape of the spring, as well as the mass of the load. Modern indicators Modern indicators that rely heavily on their supporting electronics are much more complex than their mechanical counterparts. They can not only detect and measure the shock, but also record the entire spectrum of shocks experienced over a period of several months or even years. They sometimes involve piezo-based accelerometers with low consumption of electrical power.

Hird also served in the elected ACT House of Assembly (a predecessor to the ACT Legislative Assembly), representing the electoral district of Fraser, from 1975 until 1985 for the Liberal Party; and as an independent Speaker from 1985 to 1986. Hird is currently employed at Bunnings in Belconnen, ACT. Territory politics Hird was a member of the ACT House of Assembly from 1975‚Äì1986; the last twelve months he served as Speaker.. When the House was dissolved in 1986 into make way for the Legislative Assembly, Hird's ran for election at the 1989 general election as an independent candidate, but he was unsuccessful. Hird ran again, leading a ticket called 'The Better Management ‚Äì An Independent Team', with seven other candidates in 1992, and was again unsuccessful. On his third attempt running for the ACT Legislative Assembly, Hird was successful in 1995, this time as a candidate for the Liberal Party. At the request of the ACT Chief Minister, in 1996 the ACT Auditor General completed an inquiry that provided guidelines to the Territory government for commercial dealings with companies, partnerships or individuals who are partners of family members of Members of the Assembly. The inquiry came about due to an auction of taxi plates that yielded $0.57m below budget expectation. The auctioneer for the plates was Harold Hird and Associates. The Auditor- General found that the selection of the auctioneer followed due process. The Auditor-General also found that as there were no established guidelines for Ministers, Members of the Assembly, nor public servants in how to act in such matters. Recommendations were made to establish a Code of Conduct. Hird was re-elected at the 1998 general election. At the 2001 general election, Hird ran again for the Liberal Party but was unsuccessful in retaining his seat for the party. Vicki Dunne was elected as the second Liberal candidate for Ginninderra. Following the announcement of the election result in 2001, Hird sought a recount of the votes in the electorate of Ginninderra. Hird was 55 votes behind fellow Liberal Party candidate, Dunne, at the point at which one of the two candidates had to be excluded. Hird's request for a recount was rejected by both the Electoral Commissioner and, on appeal, the full ACT Electoral Commission. In considering the request, the Commissioner and the full Commission had regard to the level of accuracy achieved by the data entry of paper ballots and the computer count. The Commission was satisfied that the level of accuracy was so high that a recount in any form could not have improved on the accuracy of the original count, and that there was no probability that the original count had indicated that the wrong candidates had been elected, given the margins between the winning and losing candidates. At the 2004 ACT general election, Hird ran on his own ticket, called the 'Harold Hird Independents'. He ran again as an independent at the 2008 ACT general election. On both occasions, he was unsuccessful in being elected. In 2005, the ACT Electoral Commissioner cancelled the party's registration at the request of the Secretary of the Harold Hird Independent Group.

He was also a talented musician, inventor, mathematician and philosopher.Biography (John Bennett Fine Paintings). Life and work Old Drury Lane Theatre on fire 1809 (detail), by Abraham Pether Rest on the flight into Egypt The Night Blowing Cereus\\" (flower painted by Philip Reinagle, moonlit background by Pether) Abraham was born in Chichester in Sussex, and was a cousin of notable engraver William Pether. In childhood he showed a great talent for music, and at the age of nine played the organ in one of the Chichester churches. Adopting art as his profession, he became a pupil of George Smith, whom he greatly surpassed. He painted river and mountain scenery, with classical buildings, in a pleasing though artificial style, somewhat resembling that of Richard Wilson; but his reputation rests on his moonlight subjects, which attracted much admiration, and earned for him the sobriquet of \\"Moonlight\\" Pether. He was partial to the combination of moonlight and firelight, as in such subjects as \\"Eruption of Vesuvius\\",The eruption of Vesuvius (1788). \\"Ship on Fire in a Gale at Night\\", \\"An Iron foundry by Moonlight\\" etc., which he painted with fine feeling and harmony of colour. Pether was a major exhibitor with both the Free Society of Artists and the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1773 to 1791, and at the Royal Academy from 1784 to 1811. His \\"Harvest Moon\\", which was at the Academy in 1795, was highly praised at the time. He had an extensive knowledge of scientific subjects, and in his moonlight pictures the astronomical conditions are always correctly observed. Pether was also a clever inventor, constructing telescopes and microscopes for his own use, and lectured on electricity using instruments of his own making.Samuel Redgrave. A Dictionary of Artists (G. Bell, 1878) p328. Although his art was popular, Pether was never able to do more than supply the daily wants of his large family, and when attacked by a lingering disease, which incapacitated him for work and eventually caused his death, he was reduced to great poverty. He died at Southampton on 3 April 1812, leaving a widow, Elizabeth, and nine children quite destitute; and the fact that they were unable to obtain any assistance from the Artists' Benevolent Fund was made the occasion of a fierce attack upon the management of that society. Elizabeth Pether later went into business with a partner as \\"Pether & Co.\\", selling black lead and chalk pencils.British artists' suppliers, 1650-1950 - P (National Portrait Gallery, London). Abraham Pether is known in the art world as \\"Old\\" Pether, to distinguish him from his sons Sebastian Pether (1790‚Äì1844) and Henry Pether (fl. 1828-1865), also landscape artists who became known for their moonlit scenes. It is thought that Abraham had a brother called Thomas Pether (they are recorded as sharing a residence); the latter was a wax modeller who exhibited portraits in wax with the Free Society of Artists from 1772-81.

His nohas are recited the world over, from India, Pakistan, Bahrain to Canada and Norway. Early life Sachay Bhai was born as Syed Ali Muhammad Rizvi in Azamgarh village Bahauddinpur Division of the province Uttar Pradesh. He was born to a family of descendants of 8th Imam of Shia Muslims, Imam Ali ar-Ridha in 1940. He was the second sibling of four brothers and five sisters. At the age of ten, his parents migrated to Pakistan and settled down in Liaquatabad C' Area (Lalookhait) Karachi. He passed his Matriculation from Jacob Lines School, Karachi in 1957. He continued his studies and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Karachi. Family Sachay was married to Syeda Jamal Akhter Zaidi. They have seven daughters and one son, Syed Ali Raza Rizvi. Ali is also a well-established poet and Nauha Khwwan and has several Nauhas to his credit. Sachay‚Äôs father Syed Yarwar Hussain was also a renowned religious poet and a number of elegy (Marsia) and Nauha are to his credit. His published poetic work consists of Marasiy - e- Yawar, vol 1 and 2. Sachay Bashay duo Syed Ali Abbas Rizvi (Marhoom), popularly known as Bashay, was younger brother to Sachay and served as his co- reciter (Bazoo) till his death in early 90s. He also served as the main reciter of Anjuman-e-Zulfiqar-e-Hyderi when Sachay left for Canada in 1988. On many occasions Sachay himself praised Bashay and publicly declared that Bashay's voice is far better than his own. The magic held in both brothers voices created a frenzy not only in Pakistan but around the world. Early Work: 1951‚Äì1962 Sachay recited Nauhas and Manqabats at many occasions but was not taken seriously due to his young age. The first ever recognition of his voice and art of nauhakhwani was received in Shia Convention, Rizvia Society Karachi. Renowned Ulema and Scholars were invited from all over Pakistan in this convention which was held due to the efforts of Allama Ibn-e- Hasan Jarchvi. Sachay recited a six-stanza poem of Allama Mohsin Azamgarhi in the first day meeting: ÿ¥ÿßŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÅ ⁄©€å ÿØŸÜ€åÿß ⁄©Ÿà ÿØ⁄©⁄æÿß ÿØŸà ÿßŸπ⁄æ ⁄©ÿ± In the last day meeting he recited with his co- reciters another six-stanza poem: ⁄©ŸÑŸÖ€Å Ÿæ⁄ë⁄æ€å⁄∫ ⁄Ø€í ÿ≠ŸÇ ⁄©ÿß ÿ¨ÿ® ÿ™⁄© €Å€í ÿØŸÖ €ÅŸÖÿßÿ±ÿß Rise to popularity: 1962‚Äì1988 After the foundation of Anjuman-e-Zulfiqar-e-hyderi, Sachay presented nauhas in an unprecedented manner. He did not follow the conventional form of nauha khwani as was carried out by legendary reciters Chajjan Sahab and Afaque Sahab in his time. He introduced Hussaini anthems and six-stanza poems and brought them to public through his voice. He recited the kalam of many poets including: Maulana Mohsin Azamgarhi, Maulana Syed Hasan Imdad, Maulana Naseem Amrohvi, Mujahid Lukhnavi, Sahir Faizabadi, Najam Afandi, Mehshar Lukhnavi and of his father Yawar Hussain Azmi. Sachay has many Nohas creditied to his own name. Some of his credits include \\"Uncha rahay upna Alam\\", and Yeh matam sada rahay . Even today the qalam Uncha Rahey apna Alam is recited worldwide by local sahib e bayaz. Sachay Bhai is highly remembered in Mumbai, India. Sachay Bhai is a Nauhakhwan that is often remembered worldwide. Sachay was the first who was invited to Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television for Naat, Nauha and Manqabat recitations. Anjuman-e-Zulfiqar-e-Hyderi (Regd.) The Shia Muslims who migrated from India after partition and settled down in Liaquatabad C' Area, Government allotted them a plot for Masjid and Imambargah so that they could carry out their religious rituals. Publicly, Sachay started his Nauhakhwani from the same Imambargah which is famously known as \\"Masjid'O Imambargah Imamia\\". He then founded a registered organisation and named it Anjuman-e-Zulfiqar-e-Hyderi and was unanimously selected as its main reciter. Badshah Mirza Sahib was elected as the first president of the Anjuman. Other than Bashay, Nazim Hussain also co-recited with Sachay in the early days of Anjuman but later changed his path and made a separate Anjuman with the co- operation of Bahadur Ali Jafri (Shaheed) and named it \\"Anjuman-e-Tableegh-e- Imamia\\". It is on the credit of Anjuman-e-Zulfiqar-e-Hyderi that founded the pillars of Azadaari in Karachi. Migration to Canada and USA In 1988, after the sudden death of his wife he migrated to Canada and then moved to United States of America. He was very warmly welcomed everywhere from Canada to USA and spread the Hussaini message throughout his stay there. Sachay Bhai in USA, 1998 Once he settled in the United States, Sachay was constantly invited to cities all over the country to spread & express his unique way of writing and reciting poetry. He was also the pioneer of establishing the first Shab-e-Dari program in the United States at Mehfil-e-Shah-e-Khurasan. The pioneer cities for USA Shab-e-Dari's, include: * Al-Khoei Center (Jamaica, NY) * Astaana-e- Zehra (Englishtown, NJ) * Idara-e-Jaferia (Burtonsville, MD) * Mehfil-e-Shah- e-Khurasan (Englewood, NJ) Till this day, Sachay is remembered in every Shab- e-Dari program throughout North America. Death He died of profound illness on 18 April 2000 in Colombia Presbyterian Hospital, New York. Legacy He left 10 complete books of Nauhas recited by him and 40 audio cassettes and CDs, easily available in market. His son Ali Raza Rizvi continues his mission in his spirit and follows in his great father's footsteps. Many of Sachay's family members are known to recite in his manner in Canada, the USA, and Karachi till this day.

Some historians consider him to be a contemporary of the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja Narendra (1022‚Äì1063 CE). Others place him in early 12th century CE. He translated Ga·πáitasƒÅrasangraha, a 9th century mathematical treatise of Mahaviracharya, into Telugu as SƒÅra Sangraha Ganitamu, popularly known as Pavuluri Ganitamu.History of Telugu Literature at Culturopedia.com It was one of the earliest translations of a mathematical text from Sanskrit into a regional language. It is the oldest scientific text written in the Telugu language. It was followed later by Eluganti Peddana's Prakƒ´rna Ganitamu, a Telugu translation of BhƒÅskara's Lƒ´lƒÅvatƒ´. George Gheverghese Joseph notes that Mallana's translation served as a model for future translations because of its clarity and innovation. Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma writes of him as: > Mallana was a superb translator. The lucidity with which he rendered the > terse Sanskrit of MahƒÅvƒ´ra is worth emulating by every modern translator of > scientific texts. His way of handling mathematical rules or examples > containing large numbers - some examples have as many as 36 digits - is > unrivaled even in Sanskrit. He abridged the material of the Sanskrit > original at certain places and expanded at others. Thus while > Ga·πáitasƒÅrasanÃÑgraha contains five methods of squaring and seven of cubing, > the Telugu version has only one each and avoids all algebraic methods. > Mallana also employs units of measure that were prevalent in the Andhra > region of his time. Another innovation or addition in Telugu version > pertains to mathematics proper. There are 45 additional examples under > multiplication and 21 under division, which are not found in Sanskrit. All > these examples have one common feature: to produce numbers containing a > symmetric arrangement of digits. Rajaraja Narendra donated Nava Khandavada village near Pithapuram to him. He was a Saivite. His grandson, also named Mallana, was a famous writer.  SƒÅra Sangraha Ganitamu  While Mahavira's work was said to be in eight adhikaras or topics, Mallana adapted it into ten topics in his SƒÅra Sangraha Ganitamu. The first topic has been popular as Pavuluri Ganitamu. The other chapters are (in chronological order): Bhagahara Ganitamu, Suvarga Ganitamu, Misra Ganitamu, Bhinna Ganitamu, Kshetra Ganitamu, KhƒÅta Ganitamu, ChƒÅya Ganitamu, Sutra Ganitamu, and Prakirna Ganitamu.

Work While still in the military, Choi made his literary debut. Most of his work centers on individuals suffering from the ideological conflicts centering on Korean national separation. He is both prolific and controversial. His most famous work is The Square, which was published in 1960 and immediately became successful.Minmusa, p 38 The Square was published on the heels of the Student Revolution on April 19, 1960. This revolution overthrew President Syngman Rhee and Choi was one of the first novelists to publish in that era. Consequently, it is regarded as having been the starting point for a new era in Korea's modern literature.

They are located at numbers 26‚Äì30 on the north side of Welsh Row, on the junction with Second Wood Street (at ). The almshouses were founded by Roger Wilbraham in 1676‚Äì7 in memory of his deceased wife in three existing cottages built in 1637; they were the earliest almshouses in the town for women. In 1705, Wilbraham also founded the Old Maids' Almshouse for two old maids in a separate building (now demolished) on Welsh Row. They remained in use as almshouses until the 1930s. The timber- framed Widows' Almshouses building, which is listed at grade II, has subsequently been used as a caf√©, public house, night club, restaurant, wine bar and hotel. Nikolaus Pevsner considers Welsh Row \\"the best street of Nantwich\\".Pevsner & Hubbard, p. 289 The street has many listed buildings and is known for its mixture of architectural styles,Bavington et al., plate 55 including other black-and-white cottages, Georgian town houses such as Townwell House and number 83, and Victorian buildings such as the former Grammar School, Primitive Methodist Chapel and Savings Bank. Two other former almshouses remain on Welsh Row: the Wilbraham's Almshouses were founded in 1613 by Wilbraham's ancestor Sir Roger Wilbraham, and the Tollemache Almshouses were built in 1870 to replace these by John Tollemache, a descendant of Sir Roger Wilbraham. History Roger Wilbraham (1623‚Äì1707/8) was born at Townsend House on Welsh Row, and inherited the family's Nantwich property on the death of his elder brother in 1649. He was the great-nephew of his namesake Sir Roger Wilbraham, founder of the Wilbraham's Almshouses. He married in 1656; his wife Alice was the daughter of another Roger Wilbraham from the Dorfold branch of the family. In 1675‚Äì76, Wilbraham experienced personal tragedy: his two eldest sons died within a few months of each other in 1675, and his wife died on 8 September 1676, the anniversary of the death of his eldest son.Hall, pp. 428‚Äì35, 437‚Äì38 A few months after the death of his wife, he decided to found almhouses for impoverished widows in her memory, describing their foundation in detail in his journal: The three existing cottages that Wilbraham converted for this purpose had been built by his father, Thomas Wilbraham, in 1637. The almshouse deed was dated 15 January 1676‚Äì7; the endowment of lands in Betchton, near Sandbach, gave an annual income of ¬£24. Each house was occupied by two widows, and had two rooms on the ground floor with a single room above.Bagshaw's Directory (1850) It is traditionally stated that a line was drawn across the main ground-floor room in each cottage, passing through the centre of the single grate, leading to arguments about housework.Vaughan, p. 17Stevenson, p. 31 In 1705, a few years before his death, Wilbraham additionally founded an almshouse for two \\"old Maids\\", with an annual endowment of ¬£3 per head.Hall, p. 372 The Old Maids' Almshouse was a small cottage with a single room on each floor located near the Widows' Almshouses, on the other side of Welsh Row.Lamberton & Gray, p. 16 Gable end to Second Wood Street In 1721, the endowments of both the Widows' and Old Maids' Almshouses were increased by Randle Wilbraham, Roger Wilbraham's eldest surviving son.Hall, pp. 359‚Äì60 They were increased again in 1834 from a bequest of ¬£500 by Peter Sprout; he and his brother William were among the town's major 19th-century benefactors.Hall, p. 362Kelly's Directory (1892) In 1850, the inhabitants of the Widows' and Old Maids' Almshouses each received, respectively, 17s 6d or 15 shillings quarterly, plus 6s 8d or 3s 4d annually for coal, and a gown and petticoat every other year; all received an additional ¬£2 1s 0d a year from the Sprout bequest. Additional cottages were added at the rear of the Widows' Almshouses on Second Wood Street in the 19th century. The Old Maids' Almshouse had only a single occupant throughout much of the 19th century. The almshouses were still being maintained by the Wilbraham family in the 1930s.Kelly's Directory (1939) By around 1935, the Widows' Almshouses had fallen vacant and their buildings had become dilapidated.Whatley, plate 11 After the Second World War, the buildings were renovated and converted into the Cheshire Cat Eating House, one of the town's best-known caf√©s and tea shops.Davies, p. 34 The interior contained a display of antiques, including man traps and bear traps.Davies, p. 37 They have subsequently been used as a public house and, from 1972, a night club. In the early 21st century, after standing empty and semi-derelict for four years, the building was renovated and opened as a restaurant, wine bar and hotel, known as Curshaw's at the Cat and most recently the Cheshire Cat. At some time after 1907, the brick cottages on Second Wood Street were painted black and white to resemble the half-timbered building; the paint was removed in the 21st-century renovation.Compare Bavington et al., plate 54, circa 1907, with Images of England photograph of 2001 The Old Maids' Almshouse still retained a single almswoman in 1939. It was sold to the local council in 1940, and demolished in the mid-1950s to make way for the access street to the Queen's Drive housing estate. Description The former Widows' Almshouses are an L-shaped building on the corner of Welsh Row and Second Wood Street. The 17th-century part of the building faces Welsh Row and comprises a terrace of three black-and-white cottages with a timber frame infilled with bricks under a tiled roof. It has six bays and two storeys, with a gabled end to Second Wood Street.Lake, pp. 124, 129‚Äì30 A two-storey 19th-century extension in brick faces Second Wood Street. Mounting block The timber frame has large tension braces (diagonal timbers) which are straight rather than curved as in similar buildings of an earlier date, such as the Chantry House in Bunbury.McKenna, p. 16 The timber work is of high quality and features ovolo moulding. The gable to Second Wood Street has a dentillated beam between ground and first floors. There are three doorways with square-headed wooden surrounds to the Welsh Row face. This face has three mullioned and transomed four-light windows to the ground floor; those to the gable have five lights. The windows retain the original wooden cases featuring ovolo and cyma mouldings. In the original layout, the doorways opened onto a small lobby area in front of the chimney breast, a characteristic feature of Nantwich buildings dating from the early 17th century. The staircase was located on the far side of the chimney breast and a wattle-and-daub partition protected the fire from draughts. The interior has been sensitively restored, and retains the exposed timbers throughout. A grade-II-listed mounting block dating from the 17th or 18th century stands outside the Welsh Row face. It has four steps cut from a single stone block, which are much eroded. The wear has been attributed to the adjacent butcher's shop (now incorporated into the Nakatcha Bar, formerly the Three Pigeons public house) belonging to Harry Bebbington, who is said to have sharpened his knives on the steps.Bavington et al., plate 54 Modern usage , the building is known as the Cheshire Cat, a restaurant, bar and hotel with 11 rooms.

Purpose The requirement for directors' reports arose out of a general move for greater transparency in corporate governance. It is useful for shareholders to find out issues such as whether the company has good finances, whether the market has potential, and whether the business has the structural capacity to expand into new opportunities. In order for shareholders to make informed decisions when casting their votes at annual or other meetings, the Directors' Report provides part of that essential minimum standard of information. It is complemented by the Director's Remuneration Report and the Company Accounts. Much of the Directors' Report requirements are basic harmonised standards in all European companies, through the Accounts Modernisation Directive, but the UK chose to go further in the interests of greater transparency and accountability. Directors' reports must be disclosed to the public, and so also serve as an important source of public information, as a form of social accounting. Following its introduction, the reports (under various names) had a bumpy history. As previously named, the Operating and Financial Review was said by Gordon Brown to be unnecessary ‚Äògoldplating‚Äô of EU regulations. Brown initially proposed scrapping it, stating it was important to place ‚Äòtrust in the responsible company‚Äô. He was widely criticised by charities, social foundations and environmental groups, leading the government to backtrack on its plan for scrappage. The present requirements are found in the Companies Act 2006. As well as social accounting these reports are used for credit-checking uses, to assess investor-worthiness and to gain background information on an individual. Law The duty of directors to produce a directors' report once a year is found in the Companies Act 2006 section 415. Under section 416, the contents must include the directors' names and the company's principal activities. The critical requirement is found in section 417(1). A business review must be carried out, though this is only for large companies. Small companies, with fewer employees and less turnover, are excepted by statutory instrument.See SI 2008/393 Under section 417(2), directors must explain how their leadership has lived up to the directors' duty in CA 2006 section 172 to \\"promote the success of the company\\" with regard to all a company's stakeholders, including the long-term interests of shareholders, employees, the environment, the community, maintaining a high business reputation, and so forth. Section 417(3) requires that a fair review of risks and uncertainties facing the company must be outlined, a requirement from the Accounts Modernisation Directive. Section 417(4) requires a \\"backward looking\\" analysis of the business' development in the last year (again required by the Directive). Under section 417(5), public companies come under a further duty, reflecting the old Operating and Financial Review. Companies must either comply with this provision or explain why they will not. If they do comply, public companies must state the main trends in the business, give information about the company's effect on the environment, employees, including contractual arrangements through supply chains that are essential to the company. All analysis, under section 417(6) and mandated by the directive, must use key performance indicators, unless the company is a small or medium company. Where appropriate, section 417(8) requires that accounts are explained. Civil liability follows, also in the case for a director's remuneration report and summary financial statements, under section 463(1) for false or misleading statements in the directors' report. Any loss caused to the company by wrong statements must be compensated for, but this is a sanction that only the company (i.e., no groups except the board of directors or company members with the power to bring derivative claims) can sue for, and liability only arises for an intentional or reckless act, or a dishonest omission. According to section 496, the company auditor must give its own report on the directors' report (a requirement that should be brief, and only operates as a badge of good health) stating whether the report is inconsistent with anything in the accounts. This is a watered-down version of the previous requirement under the Operating and Financial Review, which needed the auditor to say whether all the information emerging in the audit was consistent. Furthermore, the Operating and Financial Review required reports set out information consistently over time so that reports could be compared. It is likely this requirement exists implicitly in the basic duty to explain the contents of the report clearly, but it is not so rigid as to require the same font each year.

It is also significant as the only site in Australia to display evidence of early Polynesian settlement, and the place where the Pitcairn Island descendants of the Bounty mutineers were re-settled in 1856. The Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area (KAVHA) is one of 11 places that make up the Australian Convict Sites World Heritage serial listing, inscribed on 31 July 2010. KAVHA was included in the National Heritage List on 1 August 2007. As a place of secondary punishment, KAVHA developed a reputation as one of the harshest and cruellest of Australia's penal settlements. It was, however, also a place where humanising experiments in penal reform were conducted. KAVHA is located on the southern side of Norfolk Island, which lies to the east-north-east of Sydney. Set on the Kingston coastal plain and bounded by hills, it comprises a large group of buildings from the convict era, some of which have been modified during the Pitcairn period (from 1856 to the present), substantial ruins and standing structures, archaeological remains, landform and landscape elements. KAVHA's aesthetic qualities have been recognised since the earliest days of the first settlement. It is outstanding for its picturesque setting, historic associations, part ruinous configuration and subsequent lack of development.  Early Polynesian presence  Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk Island. Stone tools have been found at both Emily and Slaughter bays within KAVHA. Archaeological investigations have revealed evidence of landscape modifications in the Emily Bay area including artefact assemblages and structural remains that have been interpreted as a rudimentary marae, a religious structure characteristic of East Polynesian culture. Radiocarbon dating indicates Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD 1200 and AD 1600.  The first European settlement  Arthurs Vale, site of first agriculture on the island Discovered by Captain James Cook RN in 1774, Norfolk Island was settled on 6 March 1788, six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney. Cook reported the island had rich soils, tall pines suitable for ships masts and spars, and native flax that could be used for making canvas. Governor Philip had instructions to settle and secure the island as soon as possible to secure its potential naval supplies. Arriving on the Supply, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King RN and a party of nine male and six female convicts and seven staff established a settlement named Kingston. Crops were sown in the adjoining valley, Arthurs Vale, and, unlike the experience in Sydney, the Kingston crops flourished. To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales, Governor Philip relocated around one-third Sydney's population to Kingston. Extensive clearing followed and both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land. The rising land behind Kingston was cleared for surveillance and to ensure there was no cover for escaping convicts. The first settlement's population peaked at in May 1792. By 1804 the free settlers on the island significantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 percent of the total population of . On its abandonment in 1814 the settlement's buildings were destroyed.  The second settlement  In response to the report by Commissioner Bigge (1822‚Äì23) on the effectiveness of transportation, the Colonial Secretary Lord Bathurst instructed Governor Brisbane in 1824 to re-occupy the island as a 'great hulk or penitentiary' to provide secondary punishment. Secondary punishment was designed to revive the fear of transportation and deter crime in Britain and the colonies, and was a sentence applied to transported convicts who re-offended in the colony. Norfolk Island was re-occupied on 6 June 1825 by Captain Turton as commandant, with a party of 50 soldiers, 57 convicts, six women and six children. The settlement was again located around Kingston and the remains of some first settlement buildings were rebuilt, old agricultural areas rehabilitated and new areas cleared. But it was to be of an entirely different character to the first settlement. The second settlement on Norfolk Island was designed to be the extreme in convict degradation and the came to stand for worst of the transportation system. = Convict conditions = Convicts worked from sunrise to sunset. Agricultural work was done with hoes and spades, and no ploughs or working cattle were used. Convict accommodation was cramped and unsanitary and this, combined with their poor diet of one meal every 48 hours, resulted in poor health and many deaths. The harshness and degradation of the treatment metered out to the convicts was intended to break them. Floggings were common, even for trivial offences, and sentences could be extended. The worst of the convict population from both New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land were sent to Norfolk Island; men who had become so brutalised by the system that ever increasing levels of punishment only served to make them more recalcitrant. The prospect of punishment by death was no deterrent. The ruthless men charged with running Norfolk Island and controlling its convict population were themselves part of a brutal system. A number of the commandants, including Captain James Morisset, Major Joseph Childs and John Price, were particularly cruel. Mutinies and uprisings were not uncommon and invariably led to floggings and hangings. It was during Morisset's period as commandant (1829‚Äì34), which was noted for his extensive use of the lash, that Norfolk Island became renowned as 'hell on earth' and by 1833 the island's fearsome reputation was well known in Britain. = A new prison philosophy = Only one commandant of Norfolk Island, Alexander Maconochie, brought a humanising regime of reform to the second settlement period through four of its 30 years. He introduced the Merits System of Penal Discipline, which worked on the principle that the prisoner could secure freedom if they were industrious and well behaved. For a number of reasons, including the fact that his superiors disapproved of his reformist actions, his reforms failed. Under Maconochie's humanitarian influence the conditions for prisoners had improved. They rapidly deteriorated, however, under the next commandant, Major Joseph Childs. = The final years = The latter stages of the second settlement saw prisoners arriving direct from Britain to serve the first stage of their punishment under the new probation system introduced in 1843. The severity of the place continued and in his report to the British Parliament in 1847, Catholic Bishop Robert Wilson detailed the appalling conditions on Norfolk Island. His report helped bring an end to the island's use as a penal settlement. It was gradually closed between 1847 and 1855 with some convicts having been released on tickets of leave, while others were taken to Port Arthur where they served out their sentences. An Order in Council made on 29 December 1853, repealed all previous orders making Norfolk Island a penal settlement. A small party remained on the island to care for the farms and livestock and to handover to the incoming settlers from Pitcairn Island, who constituted the third settlement phase of the island's history.  Third settlement  As the Pitcairn Island descendants of the Bounty mutineers had outgrown their island home, the British government chose to resettle them on Norfolk Island. The whole Pitcairn community landed at Kingston Pier on 8 June 1856. Their descendants, who today comprise nearly a third of Norfolk Island's population, still speak the Pitcairn language. For them KAVHA is a place of special significance because it has been continually and actively used since their arrival as a place of residence, work, worship and recreation. KAVHA is uncommon as a place where a distinctive Polynesian/European community has lived and practised their cultural traditions for over 150 years.  Major buildings  KAVHA's major buildings include: * the 1829 Government House, one of the earliest and most intact remaining government house buildings in Australia, with its commanding views of the settlement * the Old Military Barracks and officers quarters constructed between 18291834 which are surrounded by high walls giving it an appearance of a military fortress * the New Military Barracks, commenced in 1836 which follows a similar fortress-like design * the Commissariat Store, dating from 1835 which is the finest remaining colonial (pre 1850) military commissariat store in Australia * the elegant Quality Row houses that provided quarters for military and civil officers. To optimise surveillance, the military complexes are elevated in order to oversight the convict precinct located closer to the water and at a lower elevation. Also to be found at KAVHA are the archaeological remains of the two convict gaols, and the perimeter walls and archaeological remains of the prisoners' barracks (1828‚Äì48) with the Protestant chapel. These show the development of penal philosophies during the period of the settlements operation, with the original gaol built for barrack accommodation while the remains of the new prison and its perimeter walls (1836‚Äì40, 1845‚Äì57) provides a rare representation of a radial design. Other archaeological remains include the blacksmith's shop (1846), lumber yard, water mill, the crankmill (1827‚Äì38), the remains of the only known human powered crankmill built in Australia before 1850, the salt house (1847), the windmill base (1842‚Äì43), lime kilns; the landing pier (1839‚Äì47) and sea wall, two of the earliest remaining large scale engineering works in Australia. The role of religion in reform is evident in the Protestant and Catholic clergyman's quarters.

Collaery was a member of the Australian Capital Territory's first Legislative Assembly for the Residents Rally party, from 1989 to 1992. He served as Deputy Chief Minister and Attorney-General from 1989 to 1991 in the Kaine Alliance Government. Early life Collaery was born in Caversham, England, four months after his father, Flying Officer Edward Collaery (RAAF) was killed in action. Colleary arrived in Australia in 1945 and was educated at the Christian Brothers College in Wollongong, New South Wales and at the Sydney Law School at the University of Sydney where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws. Political career Prior to entering politics, Collaery was a First Secretary in Australia's Embassy in France. Collaery was elected to the Assembly at its first general election, held in 1989 and was leader of the Residents Rally Party, \\"a community-based urban green party\\". The life of the first Assembly, a multi-member single electorate unicameral body, was characterised by a hung parliament and significant political instability. Confidence was waning in the minority Follett Labor government. On 5 December 1989, Collaery moved a motion in the Assembly: The vote was resolved in the affirmative (10 votes to 7 votes), and Trevor Kaine was elected as Chief Minister as leader of an Alliance Government, comprising members of the Liberal Party and the Residents Rally. Collaery was subsequently appointed Deputy Chief Minister and Attorney-General in the Kaine Liberal government with responsibility for welfare and community services; housing; sport and recreation; and youth. On 29 May 1991, Kaine announced to the Assembly that members of Residents Rally had met the previous evening and decided to advise the Chief Minister that they wanted a review of some planning decisions relating to ACT Government school sites that had been taken without the involvement of Collaery as the Deputy Chief Minister and Leader of the Rally.Hansard1991 p. 2125 Those concerns had been conveyed to the Chief Minister in a letter delivered on 28 May 1991, which indicated that if the Chief Minister tabled variations to the plan, the Residents Rally members would be forced to vote against them.Hansard1991 p.2139 That account of events was supported by comments from Rally member Dr Hector Kinloch.Hansard 1991 p.2155 The debate that followed showed that Collaery had been removed from his position as Deputy Chief Minister and Attorney General because he and the two remaining Rally members in the Assembly (Norm Jensen and Dr Hector Kinloch) could not support planning decisions affecting school sites.Hansard1991 p.2167-2165 Comments by Mr Duby, one of the three ministers involved in the decisions in Collaery's absence, confirmed that account of the reason for the fall of the Alliance Government.Hansard1991 p.2161 On 6 June 1991, a motion of no confidence in Kaine, as Chief Minister, was passed, with Collaery voting in favour. Rosemary Follett resumed the Chief Ministership, and Collaery sat on the backbenches. He was unsuccessful in seeking re- election to the Assembly at the 1992 general election. In the 1993 federal election, Collaery was an independent candidate for election to the Australian Senate, representing the Australian Capital Territory, but was unsuccessful. Legal career Collaery is the principal of Collaery Lawyers, a Canberra- based law firm with an international law division embracing international maritime and treaty law, refugee and civil rights law. The civil division embraces catastrophe law, principally catastrophic personal injury cases and high level dependency claims arising from catastrophic multi-victim cases, and medical negligence. The criminal division embraces all forms of trial work including coronial law. Collaery has appeared as counsel in various jurisdictions. As a barrister, Collaery has represented plaintiffs in a number of high-profile cases, including: * 1997 Thredbo landslide ‚Äì Coronial inquiry ‚Äì representing the families of the deceased * 2003 Canberra bushfires ‚Äì ACT Supreme Court compensation ‚Äì representing various landholders * Royal Canberra Hospital implosion ‚Äì damages claim on behalf of the family of the deceased * Compensation case where a man suffering a psychotic episode was shot by police and as a result became quadraplegic. The ACT Supreme Court awarded negligence damages against the police officer, the Australian Federal Police and ACT Mental Health Witness K Trial Collaery has represented the interests of the people of Timor-Leste over a long period of time. Collaery advocated on behalf of Timor-Leste and was legal advisor to the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) in the critical period up until formal independence in 2002. In 2013 Colleary alleged that two agents from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation raided his Canberra office and seized electronic and paper files. Colleary was representing a witness in a case brought by the Timor-Leste government against the Australian Government over the bugging of the Timor-Leste cabinet offices during the negotiations for a petroleum and gas treaty in 2004. The case was before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the Netherlands. The Australian Attorney- General, George Brandis, confirmed that he authorised a request by ASIO for a search warrant on Collaery's office, to protect Australia's national security. In June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions filed criminal charges against Collaery and his client known as \\"Witness K\\" in the Australia‚ÄìEast Timor spying scandal. Collaery and \\"Witness K\\" are accused of conspiring to communicate secret information to the Government of Timor-Leste some time between May 2008 and May 2013. Mr Collaery is also accused of sharing information with ABC journalists about the 2004 bugging operation. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that former Victorian premier and adviser to Timor-Leste, Steve Bracks called the prosecution \\"political\\". The ABC also reported that one of Australia's most senior lawyers, Nicholas Cowdery QC, questioned whether the prosecution is in the public interest and described the long delay between the 2013 raid and the prosecution as highly unusual. In a court hearing on 6 August 2019 Collaery advised that he is pleading not guilty to all charges. \\"Witness K\\" advised that he will plead guilty to breaching the Intelligence Services Act, however details of his plea are being negotiated with the prosecution. On 26 August 2019 a Four Corners report entitled \\"Secrets, Spies and Trials\\" was aired examining the Witness K trial. The report found that the cause of the delay in bringing charges against \\"Witness K\\" and Collaery was the reluctance of former attorney-general George Brandis to give consent to the prosecution. His consent was necessary due to the nature of the charges. Brandis still had not given his approval when he stood down in 2017 but his successor, Christian Porter, gave consent to prosecute within six months of taking office. The Four Corners report also contained an interview with former prime minister of Timor Leste, Xanana Gusm√£o, who said he would give evidence in court on behalf of \\"Witness K\\" and Collaery if their prosecution was not a secret trial. He said his evidence is likely to embarrass previous Australian governments. The prosecution of Collaery and \\"Witness K\\" is under the National Security Information (NSI) Act which was introduced in 2004 to deal with classified and sensitive material in court cases. The NSI Act allows certain evidence and information to be heard in a closed court. When the parties to a case cannot agree on what is of national security importance and what is not, a court must decide. The Four Corners report revealed that Christian Porter has issued a secret certificate limiting the disclosure of certain information and evidence in court that is considered prejudicial to national security. Collaery said that the use of the Act had interfered with his defence and ability to instruct his lawyers as he is not sure what can be revealed in court and is restricted in what he can tell his lawyers. In June 2020, the ACT Supreme Court held a week-long closed hearing to determine which material would be considered classified during the trial. The Court ruled in the government's favour and decided that the material identified by the Attorney-General as sensitive should remain classified in Collaery's future trial. As a result, part of Collaery's trial will take place in secret. Porter revealed in Parliament that \\"[a]s at 3 June 2020, external legal costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the prosecutions of Witness K and Mr Bernard Collaery total approximately $2,063,442.86\\". Writing Collaery has written a book, Oil Under Troubled Water: Australia's Timor Sea Intrigue which is due to be published by Melbourne University Publishing in 2020.https://www.mup.com.au/books/oil-under-troubled-waters-paperback-softback Its subject is Australia's relations with Timor-Leste since World War II. According to the publisher and CEO of Melbourne University Publishing, Dr Nathan Hollier, it will raise important questions about \\"the integrity of systems of government in Australia\\". The Australian Government Solicitor sent Collaery a letter dated 2 March 2018 in which it provided a warning that, if he disclosed secret information about the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in his book, he could face \\"a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment\\". The letter points out that Collaery is bound by the provisions of the Intelligence Services Act (2001) due to his arrangement with ASIS that was made in order for him to represent \\"Witness K\\". The letter was sent at the request of the Director-General of ASIS.

The John Juzek trademark, brand, and line of orchestral string instruments endures today through the original -year-old family-owned wholesaler, Metropolitan Music Co., currently owned and managed by the heirs of Robert Juzek (1894‚Äì1975), a founding partner and sibling of John Juzek. The string instruments ; Labels The John Juzek imprint on the labels inside the F-holes reflect an import-to-the-U.S trade name, not the craftsman. The city and country imprint reflects the location of Juzek's shops, mostly in Prague before World War II. From 1920 through the 1970s, the craftsmen were from the Bohemia region on both sides of the German- Czechoslovak border. Extant instruments from the 1920s have labels reading \\"Jan Juzek,\\" the Czech version of his given name, yet other parts of the label, \\"Violin Maker in Prague,\\" are spelled in English. ; Label colors Black labels indicate that the instrument was made by an outside vendor. Multicolored labels were used for violins. ; Instruments Janek Juzek, himself, was a violin maker, and crafted instruments in his own shop in Prague sometime between 1910 and 1920, using wood from torn down houses and churches, when he could find it, otherwise from the Carpathian Mountains, which formed the eastern border of Czechoslovakia. For the Master Art series, Juzek adopted standard patterns of classic violin lutheirs, including: # Stradivarius # Guarnerius: Guarnerian outline, soundholes slightly elongated; Stradivarian scroll # Nicol√≤ Gagliano # Guadagnini # Testore # Maggini As demand for string instruments in North America increased, John Juzek purchased violins violas, cellos, and double bases from craftsmen, mostly from Sch√∂nbach, and, according to advertising literature of Czechoslovak to build instruments fitting his specifications. ; Manufacturing and export In the early 1900s, John Juzek ran a factory in Sch√∂nbach, Czechoslovakia (renamed Luby after World War II), where the John Juzek labeled instruments were crafted. Juzek also was the export merchant for independent craftsmen, for whom the instruments were also labeled with the John Juzek name. ; Manufacturing region Sch√∂nbach, well known for violinmaking, was once dubbed the \\"Austrian Cremona\\" when Bohemia was part of Austria-Hungary. From 1880 to the beginning of World War II, and even through the 1970s, Bohemia was a thriving area in eastern Germany and Czechoslovakia, where student-quality violin making flourished as a supplier to North America. To support the town's industry, Sch√∂nbach founded the Violin Making School, founded in 1908 as an addition to the Sch√∂nbach Music School founded in 1873. A nearby town, Markneukirchen (5 miles / 8.6 kilometers from Sch√∂nbach), produced about seven million violins, violas, cellos, and basses from 1880 to 1914. Markneukirchen, during that era, was the financial center of the German music industry and before 1914, it had more millionaires per capita than any other city in Germany. Markneukirchen, with a population of 7,847 in 1900, produced and exported so many instruments to the United States that it was home to an American Consulate with a trade attach√©. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of sales to the U.S. was driven by strong U.S. currency and low labor costs in Bohemia region of Czechoslovakia. In 1900, Sch√∂nbach gained access to electricity and was connected to a railway network. In the following years, more than 3,000 craftsmen were employed as violin makers ‚Äî annual production increased to 150,000 units. In the summer of 1927, the Luthier monument was unveiled in Sch√∂nbach, memorializing all the unknown violin makers and producers of musical instruments who have made outstanding contributions in Sch√∂nbach. During The Great Depression and World War II violin making in Sch√∂nbach declined dramatically. Immediately following World War II, almost all luthiers of German descent living in Czechoslovakia were deported. Most settled in either Bubenreuth or Erlangen. ; Export and distribution The instruments were sold in North America, mostly in the New York City area, exclusively through Metropolitan Music Co. (originally named Czechoslovak Musical Instruments Company), a New York City firm founded in 1920 by Robert J. Juzek (1894‚Äì1975) Robert's four brothers were involved in the business in various capacities: # John Juzek # William Juzek (1905‚Äì1942) # Jerry Juzek (n√© Jaromir Juzek; 1901‚Äì1991) # Charles Juzek (n√© Karel Juzek; 1896‚Äì1979) Before the founding of Czechoslovak Musical Instruments Company, Robert Juzek had traveled to New York aboard the SS Imperator, arriving March 2, 1920, as a secretary for the Czecho Slovak Commercial Corp., located at 59 Pearl Street, New York City, a Czechoslovak exporter of orchestral instruments. By the 1930s, the Czechoslovak Musical Instruments Company in New York City was selling violins, violas, cellos, double basses, mandolins, banjo mandolins, ukuleles, banjo ukuleles, tenor ukuleles, tiples, banjos, tenor banjos, and guitars. After World War II ended, John Juzek no longer was connected with Metropolitan Music Co. Robert Juzek began making all the contracts directly with the shops. When Robert Juzek died in 1975, his son, Bob Juzek (n√© Robert Juzek; born 1938) became the president. Metropolitan Music Co. is now managed by Bob's two sons, Rob and Adam, the third generation family of the founder. The current John Juzek string instruments are made in Europe and China.

The Gamba shaped basses as well as the plywood basses were supplied by the Benedict Lang I shop in Sch√∂nbach pre-World War II and B. Lang II in Mittenwald post-World War II. Some of the Master Art Copy violins and cellos imprinted with higher numbers dated in the 1950s and 1960s were made by Roman Teller (died 1974), who moved to Erlangen, West Germany after World War II. Juzek family John Juzek managed the production and export of Bohemian crafted string instruments to New York City in the aftermath of World War I, through duress of the Great Depression of the early 1930s, the subsequent Nazi occupation that began in 1939, and World War II. Czechoslovakia, the name and the country, did not exist until 1918; and it ended in 1993 when the Czech Republic was formed. P√≠sek, the town where John Juzek and his five siblings were born, was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that existed from 1867 to 1918. In 1919, one year after the founding of Czechoslovakia, the Treaty of St. Germain triggered civil unrest between the Sudeten German population and the new Czechoslovak administration. From 1939 to 1945 Czechoslovakia was forcibly divided and partially incorporated into Nazi Germany. Sch√∂nbach, the main staging area where Juzek operated when the brand was founded in 1920, was part of Sudetenland, which from 1939 to 1945, was annexed to Germany as part of Hitler's Nazi occupation. In 1946, many people of Sch√∂nbach were displaced (see commentary under \\"Manufacturing region,\\" above). In 1921, Jan Juzek was single and resided in Pisek, Czech Republic. In 1930, he was married to Ella (born 1909 Pisek) and together they lived in Sch√∂nbach. In 1936, he was living in Kol√≠n, 34 miles east of Prague.

The sculpture was made in what is now modern-day France by an unknown artist who carved the artwork from the tip of a mammoth tusk. The sculpture was found in two pieces in 1866, but it was not until the early 20th century that Abb√© Henri Breuil realised that the two pieces fit together to form a single sculpture of two reindeer swimming nose-to-tail. Discovery The pieces of the sculpture were discovered by a French engineer, Peccadeau de l‚ÄôIsle, in 1866 while he was trying to find evidence of early man on the banks of the River Aveyron, although contemporary accounts attributed the find to Victor Brun, a local antiquarian. At the time, de l'Isle was employed in the construction of a railway line from Montauban to Rodez, and while digging for artefacts in his spare time he found some prehistoric flint tools and several examples of late Ice Age prehistoric art in a rock shelter of Bruniquel.Pal√¶olithic Man and Terramara Settlements in Europe, New York, The Macmillan Co., 1912. Plate XVI. The finds took the name of the rock shelter : \\"abri Montastruc\\" (Montastruc rock shelter). The hill was estimated to be high, and the artefacts were found beneath an overhang that extended for about along the river and enclosed an area of 298 square yards (249 m2). De l'Isle had to dig through of material to get to the level where the artefacts were found.Primitive Man, Louis Fiuier, p.88, accessed 2 August 2010 At this time it was thought that there were two separate carvings of reindeer as it was not obvious that the two pieces fitted together.The swimming reindeer; a masterpiece of Ice Age art, Jill Cook, bradshawfoundation.com, accessed 2 August 2010 The Mammoth spear thrower De l'Isle wrote a paper on his discovery, and his finds were exhibited in 1867 at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. People were intrigued to see the sophistication of his finds and this sculpture in particular. The carvings were remarkable in that they illustrate reindeer, which no longer live in France. Dating was possible as the two reindeer were carved in the ivory of an extinct animal. This dated the find as ancient and required a re-evaluation of the life of humans in the late Ice Age. This find was particularly astounding, as at that time no cave paintings had been discovered, and it was to be some years before those that were found were accepted as genuine.The Swimming Reindeer, British Museum Objects in Focus, accessed 3 August 2010, In fact it was only the work of Henry Christy and Edouard Lartet that had recently persuaded informed opinion that mankind had lived during the ice age and coexisted with mammoths. The evidence for coexistence came not only from the reindeer but also from a carved spear thrower which was found in the same location. This device was used to gain extra leverage when throwing a spear. In this case it was made from a piece of reindeer antler that had been carved into the shape of a mammoth.Mammoth Spear Thrower, British Museum, accessed 7 August 2010 The reindeer sculptures were again exhibited in 1884 in Toulouse, when it is speculated that a French buyer might have been found, but they were eventually procured by the British Museum in 1887. De l'Isle initially offered his finds to the British Museum for the large sum of 150,000 francs, which would have a value in excess of half a million pounds in 2010. The offer was considered much too high and was not accepted by Augustus Franks, an enthusiastic antiquarian who was in charge of the north European collection at that time. Franks had been known to fund the museum's acquisitions himself, and he sent Charles Hercules Read to negotiate with de l'Isle. Read successfully managed to bring the price down to ¬£500 (about ¬£30,000 today). The purchase was funded by the Christy Fund, a ¬£5,000 bequest by Henry Christy who had also left his own collections to the museum. \\"Rampant Hyena\\" carving found at Abri de la Madeleine, also in France It was not until 1904 when Abb√© Breuil saw the sculptures whilst visiting the British Museum that he realised that the two pieces fitted together, and were in fact two parts of a single sculpture. The sculpture is kept in a controlled atmosphere and is rarely moved. The ivory is now very fragile and it is feared that it could \\"turn to dust\\" if it were treated roughly. Unlike the mammoth spear thrower, the reindeer sculpture has no practical purpose, and is considered to be the oldest piece of art in any British museum. Age The finds came from the late Ice Age, which Henry Christy and Edouard Lartet originally called the \\"age of the reindeer\\".Europe p.200, Peter N. Peregrine, Melvin Ember, accessed 7 August 2010 That is notable as the carving of mammoth ivory depicted reindeer and the mammoth spear thrower was carved from a reindeer antler. That fixes the co-existence of reindeer, mammoths and man at a time that the area had a climate similar to that of Siberia today. Later, this period became known as Magdalenian, named after a French cave, Abri de la Madeleine, where similar art to the Swimming Reindeer were found. Appearance The sculpture shows a female reindeer closely followed by a larger male reindeer. The larger male is indicated by his size, antlers and genitals, whilst the female has her teats modelled. The reindeer are thought to be swimming in illustration of the migration of deer that would have taken place each autumn. It is known that it would be autumn as both reindeer are shown with antlers, and only during autumn do both male and female reindeer have antlers.Transcript of Episode 4, History of the World in 100 Objects, BBC, accessed 9 August 2010 At this time of year reindeer would be much easier to hunt, and the meat, skin and antlers would be at their best.Swimming Reindeer, bbc.co.uk, accessed 2 August 2010 Each of the reindeer has been marked with a burin to show different colouring and texture in the deer's coat. Oddly there are ten deeper cuts on each side of the back of the leading female reindeer. These may have been intended to indicate coloured markings, but their purpose is unclear.

The constraint can be used as a way to incorporate expressive prior knowledge into the model and bias the assignments made by the learned model to satisfy these constraints. The framework can be used to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training and inference. Models of this kind have recently attracted much attention within the natural language processing (NLP) community. Formulating problems as constrained optimization problems over the output of learned models has several advantages. It allows one to focus on the modeling of problems by providing the opportunity to incorporate domain-specific knowledge as global constraints using a first order language. Using this declarative framework frees the developer from low level feature engineering while capturing the problem's domain-specific properties and guarantying exact inference. From a machine learning perspective it allows decoupling the stage of model generation (learning) from that of the constrained inference stage, thus helping to simplify the learning stage while improving the quality of the solutions. For example, in the case of generating compressed sentences, rather than simply relying on a language model to retain the most commonly used n-grams in the sentence, constraints can be used to ensure that if a modifier is kept in the compressed sentence, its subject will also be kept. Motivation Making decisions in many domains (such as natural language processing and computer vision problems) often involves assigning values to sets of interdependent variables where the expressive dependency structure can influence, or even dictate, what assignments are possible. These settings are applicable not only to Structured Learning problems such as semantic role labeling, but also for cases that require making use of multiple pre-learned components, such as summarization, textual entailment and question answering. In all these cases, it is natural to formulate the decision problem as a constrained optimization problem, with an objective function that is composed of learned models, subject to domain- or problem-specific constraints. Constrained conditional models form a learning and inference framework that augments the learning of conditional (probabilistic or discriminative) models with declarative constraints (written, for example, using a first-order representation) as a way to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training and inference. These constraints can express either hard restrictions, completely prohibiting some assignments, or soft restrictions, penalizing unlikely assignments. In most applications of this framework in NLP, following,Dan Roth and Wen-tau Yih, \\"A Linear Programming Formulation for Global Inference in Natural Language Tasks.\\" CoNLL, (2004). Integer Linear Programming (ILP) was used as the inference framework, although other algorithms can be used for that purpose. Formal Definition Given a set of feature functions \\\\\\\\{ \\\\phi_i(x,y) \\\\\\\\} and a set of constraints \\\\\\\\{ C_i (x,y)\\\\\\\\}, defined over an input structure x \\\\in X and an output structure y \\\\in Y, a constraint conditional model is characterized by two weight vectors, w and \\\\rho, and is defined as the solution to the following optimization problem: :argmax_{y} \\\\sum_i w_i \\\\phi_i (x,y) - \\\\sum \\\\rho_i C_i (x,y). Each constraint C_i \\\\in C is a boolean mapping indicating if the joint assignment (x,y) violates a constraint, and \\\\rho is the penalty incurred for violating the constraints. Constraints assigned an infinite penalty are known as hard constraints, and represent unfeasible assignments to the optimization problem. Training paradigms = Learning local vs. global models = The objective function used by CCMs can be decomposed and learned in several ways, ranging from a complete joint training of the model along with the constraints to completely decoupling the learning and the inference stage. In the latter case, several local models are learned independently and the dependency between these models is considered only at decision time via a global decision process. The advantages of each approach are discussed in Vasin Punyakanok and Dan Roth and Wen-Tau Yih and Dav Zimak, \\"Learning and Inference over Constrained Output.\\" IJCAI, (2005). which studies the two training paradigms: (1) local models: L+I (learning + inference) and (2) global model: IBT (Inference based training), and shows both theoretically and experimentally that while IBT (joint training) is best in the limit, under some conditions (basically, ‚Äùgood‚Äù components) L+I can generalize better. The ability of CCM to combine local models is especially beneficial in cases where joint learning is computationally intractable or when training data are not available for joint learning. This flexibility distinguishes CCM from the other learning frameworks that also combine statistical information with declarative constraints, such as Markov logic network, that emphasize joint training. = Minimally supervised CCM = CCM can help reduce supervision by using domain knowledge (expressed as constraints) to drive learning. These settings were studied in Ming-Wei Chang and Lev Ratinov and Dan Roth, \\"Guiding Semi-Supervision with Constraint-Driven Learning.\\" ACL, (2007). and.Ming-Wei Chang and Lev Ratinov and Dan Roth, \\"Constraints as Prior Knowledge.\\" ICML Workshop on Prior Knowledge for Text and Language Processing, (2008). These works introduce semi-supervised Constraints Driven Learning (CODL) and show that by incorporating domain knowledge the performance of the learned model improves significantly. = Learning over latent representations = CCMs have also been applied to latent learning frameworks, where the learning problem is defined over a latent representation layer. Since the notion of a correct representation is inherently ill-defined, no gold-standard labeled data regarding the representation decision is available to the learner. Identifying the correct (or optimal) learning representation is viewed as a structured prediction process and therefore modeled as a CCM. This problem was covered in several papers, in both supervisedMing-Wei Chang and Dan Goldwasser and Dan Roth and Vivek Srikumar, \\"Discriminative Learning over Constrained Latent Representations.\\" NAACL, (2010). and unsupervised Ming-Wei Chang Dan Goldwasser Dan Roth and Yuancheng Tu, \\"Unsupervised Constraint Driven Learning For Transliteration Discovery.\\" NAACL, (2009). settings. In all cases research showed that explicitly modeling the interdependencies between representation decisions via constraints results in an improved performance.  Integer linear programming for natural language processing applications  The advantages of the CCM declarative formulation and the availability of off-the- shelf solvers have led to a large variety of natural language processing tasks being formulated within the framework, including semantic role labeling,Vasin Punyakanok, Dan Roth, Wen-tau Yih and Dav Zimak, \\"Semantic Role Labeling via Integer Linear Programming Inference.\\" COLING, (2004). syntactic parsing,Kenji Sagae and Yusuke Miyao and Jun‚Äôichi Tsujii, \\"HPSG Parsing with Shallow Dependency Constraints.\\" ACL, (2007). coreference resolution,Pascal Denis and Jason Baldridge, \\"Joint Determination of Anaphoricity and Coreference Resolution using Integer Programming.\\" NAACL-HLT, (2007). summarization,James Clarke and Mirella Lapata, \\"Global Inference for Sentence Compression: An Integer Linear Programming Approach.\\" Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), (2008).Katja Filippova and Michael Strube, \\"Dependency Tree Based Sentence Compression.\\" INLG, (2008).Katja Filippova and Michael Strube, \\"Sentence Fusion via Dependency Graph Compression.\\" EMNLP, (2008). transliteration,Dan Goldwasser and Dan Roth, \\"Transliteration as Constrained Optimization.\\" EMNLP, (2008). natural language generation Regina Barzilay and Mirrela Lapata, \\"Aggregation via Set Partitioning for Natural Language Generation.\\" NAACL, (2006). and joint information extraction.Dan Roth and Wen- tau Yih, \\"A Linear Programming Formulation for Global Inference in Natural Language Tasks.\\" CoNLL, (2004).Yejin Choi and Eric Breck and Claire Cardie, \\"Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations for Opinion Recognition.\\" EMNLP, (2006). Most of these works use an integer linear programming (ILP) solver to solve the decision problem. Although theoretically solving an Integer Linear Program is exponential in the size of the decision problem, in practice using state-of-the-art solvers and approximate inference techniques Andr√© F. T. Martins, Noah A. Smith, and Eric P. Xing, \\"Concise Integer Linear Programming Formulations for Dependency Parsing .\\" ACL, (2009). large scale problems can be solved efficiently. The key advantage of using an ILP solver for solving the optimization problem defined by a constrained conditional model is the declarative formulation used as input for the ILP solver, consisting of a linear objective function and a set of linear constraints.

He was also an antiquarian, with a particular interest in the history of the university. Life John Gutch's father, also called John, was town clerk of Wells, Somerset; Gutch was born there on 10 January 1746 and proceeded to study at the University of Oxford, matriculating as a member of All Souls College in 1765, graduating in 1767. He was ordained in the following year and was initially a curate in Wellow and Foxcote near Bath, Somerset. In 1770, he was appointed chaplain of All Souls College (a post that he would hold until his death over sixty years later), also becoming college librarian in 1771 and chaplain of Corpus Christi College in 1778. He was appointed Registrar of the university in 1797, retiring from this position in 1824 with an annuity of ¬£200 from the university. From 1795, Gutch was rector of St Clement's Church, Oxford, where from 1824 his curate was John Henry Newman. He died on 1 July 1831 and was buried at St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford. Scholar Gutch's major contribution to scholarship was his edition of Anthony Wood's History of Oxford University, a work which had had an involved publication history. Gutch's other publications included two volumes of miscellaneous historical material about the university. =Wood's History of Oxford University= By around 1668 Wood had finished a large manuscript, written in English, of the university's history. It was divided into two parts: the first dealt with the general history of the University up to 1648, and the second with the Schools, Lectureships, the Colleges and Halls, Libraries, and the chief Magistrates (Fasti) Chancellors, Provosts etc. Wood's MS was purchased by the Officers of the University Press for ¬£100, on condition that it be published in a Latin translation. It was duly translated, and edited by John Fell. Fell made his own additions, emendations and deletions, in particular striking out passages which Wood had inserted in praise of Thomas Hobbes, and substituted some disparagement. The Latin edition was printed in the basement of the Sheldonian Theatre and published in two volumes in 1674. (Vol. 1) (Vol. 2) Wood complained about this translation. cites Genuine Remains, 1693, p. 183. Thomas Warton, in his Life and Literary Remains of Ralph Bathurst (1761), was forthright: \\"The translation ... is full of mistakes; it is also stiff and unpleasing, perpetually disgusting the reader with the affectation of phraseology.\\" After some revision, Wood began in August 1676 to rewrite his original, continuing almost to his death in 1695. He left this new manuscript to the University, and it was deposited in the Bodleian library, as two volumes in folio. =Gutch's edition= Gutch edited this second manuscript copy and published it in five volumes from 1786 to 1796. The publication history is again somewhat convoluted, He began with the second half of vol. 2 of the 1674 Latin edition, the history of the Colleges and Halls (1786), followed by the Fasti Oxoniensis (1790), the latter part of vol. 1 of 1674. These were followed by the general history of the University (the Annals) in three volumes, the first of which (1792) contained Lives of the author, partially adapted by Gutch from Wood's autobiography. Gutch's last volume of the general history (1796) also contained (from p. 709) the first half of vol. 2 of the Latin edition, namely, the history of the Schools, Lectureships, Officers, Libraries etc. =Further work on Wood's legacy= Andrew Clark (1856‚Äì1922) did much further work on Wood's papers for the Oxford Historical Society. He published from them Antiquities of the City of Oxford (1889‚Äì1899), in three volumes, and The Life and Times of Anthony Wood (1891‚Äì1900) in five volumes.

Cox (born 1933) also known as Bob Cox, is a British journalist who became editor and publisher of the Buenos Aires Herald, an English-language daily newspaper in Argentina. Cox became famous for his criticism of the military dictatorship (1976‚Äì1983). He was detained and jailed, then released after a day. During this time, he received multiple threats against his family. When one of the threats included very detailed information about his then 13-year-old son, he desisted from his work; the family left Argentina in 1979. He moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he became an editor of The Post and Courier, owned by the same publishing company that owned the Buenos Aires Herald. In 2005, the Buenos Aires legislature recognized Cox for his valor during the dictatorship.  Biography  Robert Cox arrived in Argentina in 1959, and was soon hired as a copy editor by the Buenos Aires Herald, the English-language newspaper of Argentina's English-speaking community. He later married Maud Daverio, an Argentine national. His influence in the newspaper was vast, having them change their design and reach, from a small community- oriented newspaper, to a respected national daily. He was promoted to publisher in 1968. Under his direction, the newspaper moved in 1975 to a building with printing plant at 455 Azopardo Street, which remained the newspaper's offices for 34 years. Cox had married into a wealthy family, and lived a privileged life; his social circle included elite families and military figures. Initially, he sympathised with the junta because of social connections, threats from the leftist guerrillas, and an expected end to repression of Isabel Peron's government. But he and his newspaper reported clearly and often on the dirty war's atrocities, and editorialised about them, despite the junta's prohibitions. Biography in Context. At his initiative, the Buenos Aires Herald was the first media outlet in Argentina to report that the de facto government was kidnapping people and making them \\"disappear\\". As a reporter, Cox went to the public meetings by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and, also personally checked that the military authorities were using the crematories at the Chacarita Cemetery to incinerate the bodies of the \\"disappeared\\". Cox was detained in 1977: From that moment, Cox and his family lived in a permanent state of threat, suffering an attempt on his life, and his wife a failed attempt at kidnapping. When the threat of murder was imminent, he left the country. The decision was taken when one of his sons, Peter, received the following note, crudely simulating a note from the Montoneros guerilla group: Cox and family left. He held a Nieman fellowship at Harvard in 1980. They settled themselves in Charleston as mentioned above, working for a sister publication as editor of the international section, covering news like the civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua. In 2005 the Legislatura of the city of Buenos Aires after the initiative of the vice-chief of the Cabinet, Dr. Ra√∫l Alberto Puy, paid homage to Robert Cox as a journalist during the years of the military dictatorship. Cox received the prize \\"in the name of the journalists that disappeared\\". In 2005, his wife, Maud Daverio de Cox wrote a book about his life in Argentina during the years of the military dictatorship titled \\"Salvados del infierno\\" (\\"Saved from Hell\\"). In 2008, his son David wrote a book about his father's experiences in this period in Argentina titled \\"Dirty Secrets, Dirty War: The Exile of Robert J. Cox\\" In 2010, Cox was designated \\"an Illustrious Citizen of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires\\" in recognition of his humanitarian work.

She was sunk on mud flats on Swan Island in Port Phillip Bay in 1912 after being stripped of equipment and machinery. Having been commissioned in 1884, and then officially joining the Commonwealth Naval forces in 1901, the boat was the oldest ship in the Royal Navy, and is the oldest Royal Australian Navy ship still in existence (though currently buried). Design and construction Lonsdale was one of several torpedo boats ordered by the government of Victoria in 1882 to protect the colony from a possible Russian or French attack, and was built by John I. Thornycroft & Company.Queenscliffe Maritime Museum - Special Historic Items The torpedo boat was long, with a draught of , and a displacement of 12.5 tons.HMVS Lonsdale & HMVS Nepean She was designed with a low freeboard, to minimise her profile. The boat had a maximum speed of , which she would use to close rapidly with enemy vessels before attacking. Lonsdale was initially armed with two 14-inch torpedoes carried in bow recesses, and a spar torpedo, but in 1888, she was modified to carry the two 14-inch torpedoes in locally developed 'dropping gear'; a davit-like device for lowering the torpedoes into the water for launching.\\"Dann's Torpedo Dropping Gear\\" She was also armed with 2 Hotchkiss machine guns. Fate Records indicate she was sunk on mud flats on Swan Island in Port Phillip in 1912 after being stripped of equipment and machinery, however a dig later found that she had been buried in Queenscliff.HMVS Lonsdale - excavation\\"Historical-items - HMVS Lonsdale\\" Queenscliff Maritome Museum https://www.maritimequeenscliffe.org.au/historical-items/  Discovery  Based on the memory of a ship being buried in a finite location in Queenscliff, a dedicated team of marine historians and archaeologists started digging in the area for remains of a ship. There had been longstanding oral history of the ship being buried in this location, and some of the older locals remembered the ship before it was completely buried. When it was buried, the area was originally beach, but with the reclamation of land, the area of the burial was now 1 kilometre inland. A dedicated team, using a digger, ground water radar and tools unfortunately found nothing. At this point, the team switched to using a water probe, searching at the depth of 1.5m, which is what they presumed to be the buried depth. In 1983, the remains of a torpedo boat likely to be the Lonsdale (or possibly the Nepean, as they are both similar) were uncovered. Ironically, they were recovered on the grounds of the Queenscliffe Maritime Museum, so the burial site had become part of a maritime museum's collection. While a great deal of work was put into discovering the boat, after the uncovering of the conning tower, all work stopped, and the boat remains buried on the site and unable to be viewed. Despite the fact the boat is the oldest Royal Australian Navy vessel currently still in existence, and it represents a rare example of a wreck accessible without having to be reclaimed using diving equipment, no effort has been made to reclaim or preserve the vessel. As of 2010, only the boat's conning tower is exposed. References Category:Lonsdale-class torpedo boats Category:1882 ships Category:Ships built in Chiswick Category:Ships built by John I.

Life  =Revolution= Born into a noble family descended from the prestigious Colbert line, he was the son of the comte de Colbert, a rich landowner. On 23 August 1793, Pierre followed the traditional family route into the army, which was now the Republican army, although he was suspicious of the French Revolution. He fought in the 1793 campaigns in the arm√©e du Rhin, as a member of the bataillon de Paris, also known as the bataillon Guillaume-Tell after William Tell. He moved to the 11th Hussar Regiment, gaining promotion to mar√©chal-des-logis in September 1793 and to sous-lieutenant the following month. After three years in the arm√©e du Rhin and in the armies suppressing the Vendean Revolt, he was dismissed by Lazare Hoche in 1796. He left the 7th Hussars to become a commissaire des guerres to the arm√©e d'Orient, with the job of guaranteeing Bonaparte's supply lines to Egypt. During that time Bonaparte took him under his wing. =First Empire= Returning to the army after Egypt, he was wounded and made a captain in the 3rd Dragoon Regiment, before finally rising to become aide de camp to Damas. He then became adjudant-major to the Mameluks and aide de camp to Junot in 1803. He then followed Junot to become part of the arm√©e des c√¥tes. Colbert left Junot in 1805 and followed major g√©n√©ral Mar√©chal Berthier as his aide de camp. He assisted at Austerlitz, where he was wounded and made a chef d'escadron. He fought bravely at Iena and Pu≈Çtusk. In 1807 he was made a colonel and head of his old regiment, the 7th Hussars. This unit was now part of Lassalle's brigade, nicknamed the \\"infernal\\" brigade due to its passion. Napoleon made him a knight of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1808 and baron de Chabanais et de l'Empire in 1809 Colbert was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade on 9 March 1809 and put under the orders of Oudinot. He won glory at the Battle of Raab by charging and defeating Ott's hussars, cutting several squadrons of the enemy Hungarian cavalry to pieces and nearly coming to the aid of the 9th Hussar Regiment, which the Austrians were on the point of overwhelming. At Wagram Colbert was shot in the head three times and was made a commander of the L√©gion d'honneur. Attached to the Imperial Guard in 1811, he re-formed and commanded the 2e r√©giment de chevau-l√©gers lanciers de la Garde imp√©riale (better known as the Red Lancers, they were also nicknamed the √©crevisses or crayfish, after their red uniforms). He also led the brigade for the whole of the Russian campaign under the orders of the duc d'Istrie. He and the Lancers then bravely covered the Grande Arm√©e's retreat. During the german campaign of 1813 at Bautzen he broke and routed the Russians and cut them to pieces. On 25 November 1813 he was promoted to g√©n√©ral de division during the retreat back through Germany . =1815-1817= General Colbert fought bravely at Montmirail, Champaubert and Nangis, but finally defected to the Bourbons, who made him a chevalier de Saint-Louis and commander of the lancers corps in the royal guard. On Napoleon's return, general Colbert dithered until 23 March 1815. When Colbert came to the Tuileries, Napoleon said to him icily \\"General Colbert, I've been waiting for you for three days\\", to which Colbert replied \\"I have been waiting for you for a year\\" and Napoleon put him in command of his personal guard. Colbert was wounded fighting at Waterloo and after the arm√©e de la Loire was disbanded the Bourbons held a grudge against Colbert. He thus returned home, only for his loyalty to turn against him ‚Äì in 1816 he was arrested without charge, held in the Prison de l'Abbaye for two months and exiled on his release. In 1817, however, he was recalled. =1826-1853= After ten years' inactivity, his military career only resumed in 1826. However, he had lost the brilliance he had shown during the Napoleonic Wars and instead became inspector general of cavalry and commander of a division of the camp de Lun√©ville. After the July Revolution in 1830, he was put in charge of disbanding the eight cavalry regiments of the former royal guard. In 1834, general Colbert became aide-de-camp to duc de Nemours, accompanying the prince to Africa and taking part in the first expedition to Constantine in 1836. He was made a peer of France in 1838 and Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1839. He was standing next to Louis Philippe I during Giuseppe Marco Fieschi's assassination attempt and was wounded by Fieschi's gun. He died in 1853.

The book is set in Dublin, featuring undercover detective Frank Mackey, who was a supporting character in French's previous novel, The Likeness. It is the third installment of French's loosely related \\"Dublin Murder Squad\\" series. Each follows a case in the heart of Ireland, with overlapping, complex characters that get involved in cases tied to their pasts. Plot When 19-year-old Frank Mackey was left waiting outside of an abandoned house one fateful night, he believed that his lover backed out on their plans of elopement. After finding a note inside the home, the teenager was convinced that Rosie Daly must have changed her mind. Determined to escape his dysfunctional family and the prison that was Faithful Place, he left regardless, albeit brokenhearted. The plot picks up when, two decades later, Frank receives startling news. The now middle-aged detective is picking up his daughter Holly when his sister calls him with no warning. A suitcase was found behind the fireplace inside the abandoned house. Inside was girl's clothing, a birth certificate, and ferry tickets to England, the tickets Rosie and Frank had planned to use to leave their families two decades before. Frank is forced to return home after he left and never looked back. The story follows his discoveries as he revisits the past he left behind and discovers what really happened to Rosie Daly. As soon as he sees the suitcase, he recognizes the jeans his once-lover wore and the tickets they had saved so diligently to afford. Later, he explores the basement and finds a piece of concrete out of place. The police on the case arrive, and sure enough, a young woman's body is found beneath the floor. Frank knows who it is immediately, but cannot get involved in the case. Although he is a police officer, his personal involvement and connections to the confining town mean that he has to step aside. The determined protagonist cannot do so, however, and pries until he finds out that his older brother, Shay, was the one that ended Rosie's life. Shay confesses inadvertently to Frank's daughter, Holly, that he killed Rosie when he found out Frank was leaving Faithful Place for good. Shay wanted to get out just as desperately but couldn't leave their younger siblings with their abusive father. He believed it was Frank's duty to stay, and murdered Rosie out of anger when he discovered their plans.

She was built in 2001 by Aker Finnyards in Rauma, Finland (Yard No.437) for SeaFrance, as a passenger and roll-on roll-off car and commercial vehicle ferry; the engines are made by W√§rtsil√§. SeaFrance Rodin was launched on 19 May 2001. She has a sister ship, which entered service in 2005. On 16 November 2011, she was laid up in Calais Port, due to a Commercial Court ordering that Seafrance be liquidated. She resumed service with MyFerryLink on 20 August 2012. On 8 June 2015, DFDS Seaways France announced that they had chartered the ferry and her sister ship initially for a two-year period with an option to purchase. The vessel has been renamed C√¥te des Dunes for service with DFDS Seaways from early 2016. The ferry, together with her sister ship, were occupied by striking MyFerryLink workers from the end of June until the end of July. Both ships were vandalised by the staff and the whole interior destroyed. Machinery The propulsion system is split into two rooms. The main engines are two W√§rtsil√§ 12V46B units, each with an output of 11,700 kW, which are positioned forward. Two smaller W√§rtsil√§ 8L46B units, each with a 7,800 kW output are located aft. These are combined in twin Schelde gearboxes, which each have a 4,750kVA ABB alternator driven from the aft side. These in turn drive 5m diameter Lips CP propellers. This arrangement gives a service speed of 25 knots at 85% MCR. Stability is afforded by a pair of ACH fin stabilizers controlled by a digital Pinfabb Stabilizers System. Steering is carried out by twin Becker flap rudders, controlled by Porsgrunn steering gear. These rudders can be moved independently in harbour to assist the 1,800 kW Lips thruster located in the stern. There are also three 1,800 kW thrusters in the bow and four W√§rtsil√§ 8L20 engines driving l7l0kVA ABB alternators for electricity supply.

Zoji La had been seized by Pakistani raiders in 1948 in their campaign to capture Ladakh. The pass was recaptured by Indian forces on 1 November in a daring assault, which achieved success primarily due to the surprise use of armour, then the highest altitude at which armour had operated in combat in the world. Initially, an unsuccessful attack was launched by the 77th Parachute Brigade (Brig Atal) to capture Zoji La. Operation Duck, the earlier name for this assault, was renamed as Operation Bison by Lt Gen Cariappa, the Western Army commander. M5 Stuart light tanks of the 7th Cavalry regiment were moved in dismantled condition through Srinagar and winched across bridges while two field companies of the Madras Sappers converted the mule track from Baltal up the Zoji La to Gumri into a jeep track. The surprise attack on 1 November by the brigade with armour supported by two regiments of 25 pounders and a regiment of 3.7 inch guns, saw the Pakistanis being surprised.

It is available on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Plot College student Max Matheson survives a car accident that kills his fianc√©e, Kayla. As a result, he becomes emotionally disturbed and has to undergo psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont, making some progress in overcoming the guilt over the accident (although the other driver was responsible for it). To help Max move forward, his father, Jack Matheson, reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans and persuades Max to replace the former security guard, who recently quit his job after cutting himself up on duty. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager Keller Landreaux, the buyer Jenna McCarty, and the vice-president of operations Ryan Parker. Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror and then sees Jenna's naked reflection ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna is thrown through glass doors by her reflection, and a shard of glass decapitates her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost but instead sees Ryan's reflection being eviscerated. He tries to contact Ryan but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed in the same way as his reflection. Traumatized, Max calls his father and tells him he wants to quit the job. Right then, Max sees his father's face covered in cuts in a puddle and races to his house. Jack is almost killed by his reflection. Max hints to whoever is manipulating the mirrors that he would do anything she wants him to do if she spares his father. Max later returns to the Mayflower, but he is confronted by Detectives Huston and Piccirilli, who recounts what happened to Ryan and Jenna. Max denies any involvement and they let him get back to work, though they remain suspicious. Max goes to the main mirror to find out who the ghost is. Suddenly, Max's reflection uses his flashlight to show him the way. Following the light, he finds a box containing an ID of Eleanor Reigns, a new employee of the Mayflower who disappeared two months ago. The light shines outside and Max finds a missing person flier for Eleanor. He reads it before contacting Eleanor's older sister, Elizabeth, to learn details of her disappearance. Together, they discover that someone had deleted the surveillance files on the night of Eleanor's disappearance in the store's computer. Max and Elizabeth visit Henry Schow, the store's former security guard and the last person who accessed the files. Henry's mouth had been scarred by his reflection. Through Henry, they learn that Eleanor is dead. A flashback shows what happened to Eleanor. Two months prior, during the Mayflower's grand opening party, Jenna and Ryan spiked Eleanor's drink with drugs. Keller raped Eleanor while she was intoxicated and finally killed her when she tried to run away. Henry found Keller burying Eleanor's body in Mayflower's basement crawlspace. Keller orders him to delete the surveillance files to cover up his crime. After her death, Eleanor, whose spirit is trapped in the mirror world, began seeking revenge on those responsible for her rape and murder. She manipulated Henry's reflection to eat broken shards of glass before killing Jenna and Ryan. When Eleanor realized that Max could see her, she forced him to help her make contact with her sister by threatening his father's life. Max understands that his near-death experience from the car accident has given him the ability to see the spirits. Max and Elizabeth go to the Mayflower and search for Eleanor's body in the basement. They are chased by Keller after he learns that they know what happened. He nearly strangles Elizabeth, but Max saves her, thus recreating the near-death encounter and allowing Elizabeth to see Eleanor. After seeing Eleanor again, Max wrestles Keller, pushing him into the main mirror. Eleanor, acknowledging Max for his help, pulls Keller inside the mirror and kills him, leaving Max and Elizabeth in shock. At the police station, Henry confesses to the detectives his involvement in the cover-up of Eleanor's murder. It is implied that Keller is declared by the police as a fugitive, and is blamed for Jenna and Ryan's deaths. The interrogation room's one-way mirror starts to crack when Henry is alone, and he calmly sees Eleanor on its reflection. Eleanor kills Henry as the screen cuts to black.

Life Damas was born in Paris. Destined by his family for a career in architecture, instead he joined the National Guard on 14 July 1789 and served in the camp sous Paris in 1792. Damas's mathematical knowledge led g√©n√©ral Meusnier of the engineers to choose him as his aide-de-camp on coming to take command of Paris. Damas went with Meusnier when Meusnier moved to the arm√©e du Rhin, which was commanded by Custine. He was in Mainz when it was besieged in 1793 and found himself close to Meusnier when Meusnier was mortally wounded crossing the Main. Damas was then made an adjudant-g√©n√©ral, then chef d'√©tat-major under Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber and finally g√©n√©ral de brigade on 6 December. He distinguished himself in the crossing of the River Rhine, during which he took an Austrian position at bayonet-point and was wounded in the leg by a bullet just as, in the words of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, he was showing the army the path to victory. He was also noted for his conduct at the assault on Alexandria, the capture of Rosetta, the battle at Chebreiss, the battle of the Pyramids and the battle at Ghem√©li√©, all during the French invasion of Egypt. He also took part in the destruction of the Mameluk camp before El-Arichet and caught the plague in Jaffa. He then rose to g√©n√©ral de division and commanded part of Upper Egypt after Kl√©ber's death. After the battle unwisely begun by Jacques-Fran√ßois Menou, general Damas was ill-treated in the reports back to Paris and disgraced by Napoleon Bonaparte. Damas left the army and was jobless for five years. He was implicated in the trial of Jean Victor Marie Moreau and only freed at the request of Joachim Murat. When Murat became Grand Duke of Berg in 1806, he made Damas his secretary of state and military commander. He fought in the French invasion of Russia, distinguishing himself at the battle of Berezina. His brother, General Fran√ßois Auguste Damas, was killed in the same campaign. He then returned to the Duchy of Berg, then in 1815 to France with the title of inspector general of the infantry. The restored king Louis XVIII of France made him a colonel and commander of the garde royale de Paris (later known as the gendarmerie royale). He remained loyal to the king during the Hundred Days, during which he served as inspector general of infantry. He held his posts from 1816 until his death in Paris in 1828.

This 5 star hotel is part of an independent UK based hotel group, Elite Hotels who also own Tylney Hall in Hampshire, Ashdown Park Hotel near Forest Row and Luton Hoo in Luton. Heritage On 13 May 1874 the Eastbourne Gazette announced that a local resident William Earp was proposing to build a hotel with a 400-foot frontage at a cost of ¬£50,000. The result was the Grand Hotel, designed by local architect Robert Knott Blessley and constructed in 1875. The Grand Hotel is well known for its association with music. Claude Debussy corrected the proofs of La Mer between 24 July and 30 August 1905 in Suite 200, which is now known as the Debussy Suite. Eastbourne was also where Frank Bridge completed work on his suite The Sea in 1911. The Grand Hotel Orchestra broadcast live on the BBC from the Great Hall every Sunday night from 1924 to 1939 on the programme Grand Hotel. During the Second World War, Eastbourne was easy prey to air raids and the hotel eventually closed down and became a military headquarters. The hotel was taken over by the De Vere Hotel Group in 1965 and then by Elite Hotels in 1998 when a complete refurbishment took place. The tradition of live music and dancing continues. Rooms The Grand Hotel has 152 rooms, including 23 suites, 30 junior suites and 99 rooms. The hotel also offers conference and banqueting facilities with 17 fully equipped conference and meeting rooms of varying size. The largest is the Compton Room which can accommodate up to 300 guests in a theatre-style layout. Fire On 26 June 1995 there was a serious fire at the Grand Hotel. The fire started when workmen had been repainting, using blow torches to strip off old paint. The fire spread quickly partly because of hidden roof voids and the tar pitch in the roof. The hotel was evacuated and there were no casualties.

Life cycle Pupa of Dixeia pigea =Eggs= Groups of tiny, elongated eggs are laid on the undersurface of the leaves of the food plants. =Larvae= The larvae are green; pale green on the back and darker green on the sides when young, and develop two rows of pale green blotches down the length of the body as they grow older. The food plants are Capparis sepiaria and Capparis tomentosa. =Pupae= The pupae have an unusual shape, with a pointed 'nose' and a notable spike on each side of the body protruding from a broad, flattened area midway down the body. There is a smaller spike both to the fore and rear of each of these larger spikes, and a small spike on each side of the body just to the rear of the head. The larger spikes resemble to some extent the double, hooked thorns on the stems of the food plant, Capparis tomentosa (see image). The pupae may be pale green, dark green or brown in colour. The wing areas show whitish or yellowish with dark spots near to hatching and the body becomes greyish. =Adults= The flight period is all year. They have been described as having a medium-fast, random flight pattern or as a rather weak, slow flying butterfly.Cooper, R. (1973). Butterflies of Rhodesia.

Hayes was familiar with the material as she had starred in a 1926 Broadway revival opposite Kenneth MacKenna.Pictorial History of the American Theatre:1860-1985 p.226 by Daniel C. Blum c.1958,1970(this edition updated to 1985)What Every Woman Knows revival of 1926, Bijou Theatre, opened April 13 1926; 268 performances Plot Alick Wylie (David Torrence) and his sons David (Donald Crisp) and James (Dudley Digges) are greatly concerned about Alick's daughter Maggie (Helen Hayes), who has been jilted by a minister. She is less than heartbroken, but they fear for her marital prospects at the age of 27. When they catch poor but ambitious 21-year-old John Shand (Brian Ahern) breaking into their house late at night to use their library, they seize the opportunity. Impressed by his initiative, they offer him ¬£300 to finance his studies provided that he give Maggie the option of marrying him after five years. After some thought, he agrees. The Wylies insist he sign a formal contract. As the five years draw to an end, he stands for Parliament and wins. Two of the \\"quality\\", la Contessa la Brierre (Lucile Watson) and her niece Lady Sybil Tenterden (Madge Evans), show up to congratulate him. Lady Sybil had lately shown an unexpected interest in politics after seeing the handsome victor. On the train to London to take his seat, John is given the opportunity by Maggie to back out of their agreement, but he avers that a bargain is a bargain and marries her. Lady Sybil helps forward John's political career, and the two fall in love. Maggie too works diligently and craftily on her husband's behalf, planting ideas that he takes for his own. John has become a financial expert, and is for the country dropping the gold standard, which is against the policy of his Labour Party. When the influential politician Charles Venables (Henry Stephenson) comes to sound him out, Maggie sees him first and takes it upon herself to state that John would resign from the party rather than betray his principles. Venables is delighted. Matters finally come to a head on the Shands' second wedding anniversary, with John telling Maggie and her family that he and Lady Sybil are in love. He insists on writing a letter of resignation from Parliament. Maggie persuades him to postpone their public separation for a month so he can finish writing his book. She arranges for him to stay at the estate of her good friend, la Contessa; secretly, she also asks la Contessa to invite Lady Sybil as well. Things turn out the way she had hoped: John and Lady Sybil's ardor does not survive having to spend an entire month together. Meanwhile, Maggie goes to see Venables. She presents him with John's letter, telling him that her husband has resigned over the gold standard. Venables is so impressed he offers John an important post in the coalition government he is forming. When John finds out what Maggie has done, he is somewhat offended. However, she assures him that \\"what every woman knows\\" is that behind every successful man is a woman who secretly strives to help him. In the end, he sees things her way, and is cajoled into laughing for the first time in his life.

The film is based on the true story of Michael David \\"Mike\\" Weiss and Paul Danziger. It was chosen as one of the spotlight films for the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, premiering on April 21, 2011 in New York City.  Plot  Mike Weiss, a young Houston lawyer and drug addict, and Paul Danziger, his longtime friend and straitlaced law partner, are the personal injury lawyers behind the law firm Danziger & Weiss. They decide to take on a case involving Vicky Rogers, a local ER nurse, who was pricked by a contaminated needle on the job and contracted HIV. Vicky shows Mike and Paul a safety needle, invented by her family friend, Jeffrey Dancort, which defends against accidental needlesticks by only being used once, and she urges them to help bring the product to hospitals. Vicky later dies from her illness. Mike digs deeper into the case, and discovers no one is willing to buy the needle because of a healthcare/pharmaceutical conspiracy and bribery racket. With the threat of exposure, heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense led by attorney Nathaniel Price. Out of their league and out of money, the mounting pressure of the case pushes the two underdog lawyers and their business to the breaking point. In the meantime, Mike is struggling with his heavy drug usage and his loneliness. He seeks sex therapy as a source of comfort and is consistently in the company of prostitutes. His personal struggles impede on his professional ambitions, as he misses many of the meetings and investment events, driving a wedge between him and Paul. Mike, Paul, and Dancort gain the support of Senator O'Reilly, not before she gives Mike an ultimatum: get clean. Mike's heavy withdrawal leaves him hospitalized, only adding to the financial burdens of the firm. The momentum of the case seems to come to a standstill: Senator O'Reilly pulls out after United Medical Health Supplies lobbies for her re-election campaign and Paul, with a new baby at home, is not interested in pursuing the case over his family. They meet with Nathaniel Price, and he offers a settlement, the tipping point for the conflict between Mike and Paul. Their conflict comes to a head as Mike argues to take the case to trial and seek justice, while Paul protests there is no feasible way they can continue all the way financially. Mike meets a former employee of Thompson Needle Manufacturers and a friend of Vicky's, who implores him to continue the case on behalf of the lives affected by used needles, which spread AIDS and Hepatitis worldwide. Mike meets with Nathaniel Price and pledges he will personally find new clients and hospital employees affected by these unsafe needles across the country. However, the next day, Paul finds Mike dead from an overdose. At the settlement conference, Paul walks in with famous personal injury attorney Mark Lanier, declining the settlement and proclaiming that they will see them in court. The movie's postscript tells the audience that in 2004, Attorney Lanier settled a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest medical supply manufacturer for over $150 million. \\"As a result, thousands of hospitals throughout the United States now use safety needles.\\"  Cast  * Chris Evans as Atty.

The director dedicated the film to the real life attorney Michael David Weiss who died in 1999 of a drug overdose at age 32.

The total domestic gross was $68,945. Puncture was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 3, 2012. The film promotes safe needle use worldwide.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 51% of 41 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating was 5.6/10; the site consensus reads: \\"There's a compelling story at the heart of Puncture but viewers will have to pierce through the formulaic storytelling to find it.\\" Metacritic rated it 54/100 based on 17 reviews. Roger Ebert rated it 3/4 stars and wrote that Evans' performance upstages the issues raised in the film. On Evans' performance, Ebert writes, \\"Electrifying in the role, Evans reminds me of other great out- of-control druggies played by Al Pacino and Nicolas Cage. A movie like this is a reminder that box-office success can be unfair and limiting to gifted young actors.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"The film is chock-a- block with extraordinary performances and no one will fault the filmmaking either. This is a well-made movie, make no mistake. It just suffers from a dysfunctional hero.\\" Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote, \\"Though conceptually intriguing, the mix of downward drug spiral with uphill struggle for good never really coalesces.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Notable at least in part for its fumbled potential, this health-care-industry melodrama possesses all the right ingredients: an idealistic young lawyer, a corrupt corporate villain and a sympathetic victim. It just fails to assemble them into a compelling whole.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2011 films Category:2011 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Houston Category:Films shot in Houston Category:Films about drugs ","title":"Puncture (film)"},{"id":"28256200","text":"Vadakkanchery Veeraraghava Bhagavathar Ravi is an Indian classical music violinist.‚ÄòEvery stage is a classroom‚Äô.

It bears little in common with the 1905 novel Ayesha: The Return of She by H. Rider Haggard. It was made by Hammer Films as a loose sequel to the 1965 hit film She. Plot A beautiful young European girl, Carol, is drawn through mental telepathy to the ancient lost city of Kuma, there to become the reincarnation of its lost former ruler, Ayesha, and consort of her predecessor's lover, Kallikrates. In return, Men- Hari, a member of the Magi, the ancient Chaldean race of wise men, will also be allowed to enter the sacred flame and become immortal, which will expand his already formidable mental powers to the point where he will be able to take over the entire world. To achieve this, however, he must bring Carol to Kallikrates before the sacred flame is ignited during a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical alignment. Men-Hari therefore uses his powers ruthlessly to compel Carol to come to Kuma. Men-Hari is opposed by his father, Za-Tor, longtime leader of the Magi, and by Dr. Phillip Smith, a psychiatrist, who meets and falls in love with Carol during her journey. In the course of their travels, Carol and Phillip are separated. Kassim, a local mystic, attempts to break Men-Hari's control over Carol, but Men-Hari learns of this. Partly at Kallikrates' bidding, Men-Hari wrests the leadership of the Magi away from Za- Tor, and leads the rest of the Magi in a forbidden occult ritual to overpower and destroy Kassim. Shortly thereafter, Carol and Phillip are re-united, and they continue their journey to Kuma. Upon their arrival, Carol is welcomed, but Phillip, whom Men-Hari rightly perceives as a threat to his evil scheme, is imprisoned. Za-Tor comes to Phillip and discusses the situation with him, and comes to realize the danger in Men-Hari's plot. He agrees to do whatever he can to help Phillip and then departs. Sharna, one of Kallikrates' servant girls, and who is in love with Kallikrates, helps Phillip to escape, while Za- Tor speaks to his assistant in an effort to incite a rebellion against Men- Hari. The plot succeeds to some extent, and Phillip arrives at Kallikrates' chambers just as the sacred flame is ignited. Before Carol can walk through the flame, however, Phillip desperately calls out to Carol, even as he is seized by Kallikrates' guards. Phillip's cries succeed in breaking Men-Hari's control over Carol, and at that moment Za-Tor confronts Men-Hari, explaining his plot to Kallikrates. Realizing that Za-Tor is telling the truth, Kallikrates orders that Carol and Phillip both be released. He also bars Men- Hari from entering the sacred flame, and denounces him as the power-mad traitor that he is. Stung to fury by the frustration of his plot, Men-Hari stabs his father in the stomach with a long dagger. As Phillip rushes to Za- Tor's aid, Men-Hari attempts to kill him, but Kallikrates' guards kill Men- Hari with their swords at their king's command. Kallikrates, now despondent beyond all reasoning, then commits suicide by re-entering the sacred flame, despite Sharna's efforts to stop him. As the others watch in horror, Kallikrates ages hundreds of years in a matter of seconds, then dies and crumbles to dust. As Phillip and Carol leave the chamber and head for the main entrance to the city, Za-Tor revives just long enough to pray for Kuma's destruction, since its people have now become evil beyond all hope of rehabilitation. In direct response, the sacred flame explodes outward, and an earthquake begins to tear the city apart. Phillip and Carol just barely make it out of the entrance before the city crumbles and collapses, killing everyone within. As the two lovers begin making their way back to civilization, the last fragments of the giant sculpture of Ayesha that stood above the entrance are engulfed by the sacred flame, signifying the end of Kuma and the Magi for all time.

Perhaps she was a model. I figured she was making it with somebody behind the scenes. I wonder whatever became of her. She totally disappeared. Olinka had a physical resemblance to Ursula, except that Ursula could act a bit. Olinka's knowledge of screen craft was somewhat limited. It was impossible to work with her. I realised, 'Not a great deal between the ears here.' But I bit my tongue and thought of the paycheck.\\" The film would be Judd's last as a leading man. Don Sharp was originally meant to direct but he was unavailable. Release The film was poorly received, critically and commercially. It was widely criticized as having little if any resemblance to the H. Rider Haggard stories on which it was supposedly based. =Box office= According to Fox records the film required $1,575,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $850,000 so it made a loss to the studio.

The Spanish squadron was victorious, capturing two English ships. Background After failed attacks against San Juan de Puerto Rico and Panam√°, during which Francis Drake and John Hawkins had perished from dysentery, the English fleet anchored in Portobello to reorganize and careen their ships prior to return to England. Sir Thomas Baskerville, Colonel-General of the landing forces, was then elected by his officers as the new commander of the retreating fleet,Corbett p. 29 whose number of ships soon decreased to 18, as two of them, the Delight and the Elizabeth, had to be burned or sunk due to lack of crew.Ullivarri p. 168 Two generals, 15 captains, and 22 officers had died in combat or from disease; a loss which demoralized the men on board. The English fleet departed Portobello on February 8. A few days later a storm scattered the fleet. Several ships returned to England via Jamaica, while Baskerville, with the bulk of the fleet, headed to Cabo Corrientes to sail to his country along the northern coast of Cuba. In Spain, meanwhile, news of Drake-Hawkin's attack in Gran Canaria had reached the Spanish court. A fleet of 8 galleons and 13 other vessels (mainly hulks and pinnaces) under Captain General Don Bernardino de Avellaneda, with Juan Guti√©rrez de Garibay as Admiral, Juan de Villaviciosa as flag captain, and about 3,000 men aboard, was dispatched from Sevilla to Cuba, which was supposed to be menaced by the English. In early March they arrived at Cartagena de Indias, disposed to pursue Baskerville.Ullivarri p. 169 Battle On March 7, part of Avellaneda's fleet surprised two English ships south of Cienfuegos. They were the Pegasine and were commanded by Thomas Maynarde. Engaged by the Spaniards, they received extensive damage, but finally managed to escape avoiding the dangerous shoals of Pinar del R√≠o, and reached England on May 3, just a week before Avellaneda encountered the bulk of the English fleet supplying of wood and water at Guaniguanicos Cove, in the Island of Pinos, south of Cuba. Avellaneda immediately ordered his ships hoist their flags and attack. Baskerville, whose flagship was John Hawkin's La Garlande, however, tried to avoid combat scattering his ships towards Cape San Antonio. Most of the English ships escaped because they abandoned their boats and threw their baggage into the water. Vice Admiral Juan Guti√©rrez de Garibay's three-ship vanguard managed to intercept and capture two ships: a 300-man galleon and a 25-man patache whose prisoners were put to work on Havana's fortifications. The loss on the Spanish side amounted to 80 men killed or wounded and a warship, sunk during the clash.Fern√°ndez Duro p. 116 Aftermath Avellaneda's fleet pursued the English as far as the Old Bahama Channel. On 22 May, returning to Havana, they captured John Crosse‚Äôs pinnace Little Exchange off the town. This was not the last loss suffered by the English, as only eight of the 28 warships which had departed England on 1595 returned to their country. The survivors reached Plymouth at the same time the Spanish treasure fleet disembarked at Sanl√∫car de Barrameda with 20 million silver dollars, one of the largest shipments ever to arrive from the Americas.

The male advertisement call typically consists of three notes, one long note with several subnotes, and two short notes, without subnotes. Dominant frequency is about 1800 Hz. Calling starts at dusk and lasts until at least midnight. Habitat and conservation Litoria humboldtorum inhabits primary tropical moist forest, but it can also be found in partly logged and regenerating areas of forest. These frogs are typically found near water or road margins, perched on vegetation 2‚Äì6 m above the ground. The altitudinal range is asl. Litoria humboldtorum is an uncommon species, but it appears to be reasonably adaptable, and no threats have been identified.

Long range plan NJTPA planning activities are guided by its long range plan, which is updated every four years. The NJTPA Regional Transportation Plan analyzes all aspects of transportation in northern and central New Jersey and sets an investment blueprint for the next 25 years. The Board of Trustees adopted the current plan, Plan 2045: Connecting North Jersey, in November 2017.https://apps.njtpa.org/plan2045/draftplan.html The plan incorporates emphasis areas established by the federal government, state government transportation and land use policy, and local government transportation goals. The plan considers the many transportation challenges the region faces: severe road congestion and unreliable travel times in many locations; public transit that serves many, but is limited in some areas and reaching capacity in others; a need for more facilities for safe walking and biking; and, perhaps most critically, the vital need for new rail tunnels under the Hudson River. Plan 2045 focuses on meeting these challenges by preserving and enhancing the region's roads, bridges, rail lines, port facilities and more. It also considers game changers such as self-driving cars, truck platoons, adaptive traffic signals, alternative fuel vehicles and the increase in ride hailing services. The plan also reflects input from citizens throughout North Jersey, who said they want walkable communities, more transit options, more reliable commute times and better access to jobs among other things.http://njtpa.org/newsroom/njtpa-update#plan While mobility is a primary concern, Plan 2045 also considers how transportation investments can promote broader regional objectives. To that end, the plan incorporates the four themes ‚Äî competitive, efficient, livable and resilient ‚Äî and corresponding strategies that emerged from Together North Jersey,http://togethernorthjersey.com/ an extraordinary region-wide planning consortium launched in 2013, which NJTPA continues to play a leadership role in. Street Smart NJ Street Smart NJ is a statewide pedestrian safety campaign coordinated by the NJTPA. Street Smart NJ is a public education campaign coordinated by the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority that aims to raise awareness of pedestrian and motorist laws and change the behaviors that lead to pedestrian and cyclist crashes and fatalities. Obeying traffic laws and street signs is vital to everyone's health and safety.http://bestreetsmartnj.org/ Street Smart NJ emphasizes educating drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists through mass media, as well as targeted enforcement. Since its inception in 2013, more than 60 communities have participated in Street Smart NJ in some way. The campaign uses outdoor, transit and online advertising, along with grassroots public awareness efforts and law enforcement to address pedestrian safety. Part of the impetus behind Street Smart NJ was that the Federal Highway Administration identified New Jersey as a pedestrian ‚Äúfocus‚Äù state due to the high incidence of pedestrian injuries and fatalities. In 2014, 169 pedestrians died as a result of pedestrian-vehicle crashes in New Jersey. From 2011 to 2014, 591 pedestrians were killed and more than 17,000 injured on New Jersey's roadways, which translates to one death every 2.5 days and 11 injuries daily. Evaluations of previous Street Smart NJ campaigns have shown positive results. There was a 28 percent reduction in pedestrians jaywalking or crossing against the signal and a 40 percent reduction in drivers failing to yield to crossing pedestrians or cyclists following campaigns the NJTPA managed in March 2016.http://bestreetsmartnj.org/update/street-smart-nj-campaign-evaluation- report-released/ See also *Metropolitan planning organizations of New Jersey *New York Metropolitan Transportation Council *Regional Plan Association References External links * * Plan 2035 * About MPOs Category:Transportation in New Jersey Category:Transportation planning Category:Metropolitan planning organizations Category:State agencies of New Jersey Category:Companies based in Newark, New Jersey Category:New York metropolitan area ","title":"North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority"},{"id":"28256369","text":"John McMillan's Log School is a landmark log building in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania that was the site of John McMillan's frontier latin school during the 1780s. It is a symbol of Canonsburg and Canonsburg's educational tradition. In 1930, The Pittsburgh Press said that the building was \\"viewed by the pioneers with even more reverence than Pittsburgh now view the towering Cathedral of Learning in Oakland.\\" It is one of the oldest buildings in Western Pennsylvania. It is the \\"oldest educational building west of the Allegheny Mountains.\\" The school grew into Canonsburg Academy, which eventually developed into Washington & Jefferson College. The building is rectangular in shape and is 14 feet long. It was originally located in a field a mile south of Canonsburg. McMillan based the school on the William Tennent's Log College in eastern Pennsylvania. The building doubled as a stable when McMillan was not teaching classes. After only a year, the original building was destroyed by fire and rebuilt. The curriculum was a generalized classical education, including mathematics, grammar, rhetoric, natural history, Greek, and Latin, with a focus on preparing young men for Presbyterian ministry. It was moved to its current location in front of the Canonsburg Middle School, which stood of the location of Jefferson College, in 1895. After McMillan died in 1833, his family continued to operate his farm and used the building as a workshop space. Jefferson College students often made the pilgrimage from Canonsburg to the building. In 1894, the building was offered to Jefferson Academy, which then occupied the former Jefferson College campus. Jefferson Academy closed in 1910 and the maintenance of the building fell to Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa Psi, two fraternities that were founded at Jefferson College. In 1930, the building was adopted by the national officers of Phi Gamma Delta. The original preservation plan called for the college to be protected by a steel and glass canopy. The fraternity agreed to fund the restoration of the building. In 1940, Phi Gamma Delta attempted to move the building to the campus of Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania, a plan that caused an uproar from the Canonsburg community. In response, Phi Gamma Delta let the town retake control over the building, which was then placed under the care of a \\"Log Cabin Association.\\" In 2004, the Jefferson College Historical Society's Log Cabin Preservation Project Committee decided to restore the building. The renovation project was jointly funded by Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, and the historical society's Log Cabin Fund.

The car was designed and built by its driver Richard Noble, who later achieved the land speed record with his car Thrust2. Thrust1 itself was never intended to be a contender for the record. Noble's plan was for three cars: Thrust1 \\"to learn the ropes\\",Noble, Thrust, p. 33 a second demonstration car to raise interest and the essential large-scale sponsorship, then Thrust3 for an attempt on the record. Details The car was powered by a military-surplus Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, as the simplest jet engine available. The particular engine used was a Mk 8 from a Gloster MeteorSourced from well-known surplus dealers, Portsmouth Marine Salvage of around 3,500 pounds thrust. The ladder chassis was also acquired as surplus, from Noble's employers GKN Sankey. The extremely tight project budget was initially funded by Noble selling his own car, a Triumph TR6.A chassis, incidentally, built in part of the same GKN Sankey plant The direct costs of the project, estimated afterwards, were at around ¬£1,500, including ¬£1,100 for the TR6Noble, Thrust, p. 46 Sponsorship was acquired from a variety of small agreements, including sponsorship-in-kind from the tool manufacturer Black & Decker. Construction began in the garage of Noble's flat in Thames Ditton. By 1975, the car was completed in a lock-up garage at Turnham Green. The first test run was at RAF St Athan in South Wales. This was little more than a shakedown at low power, and no more than 80 mph. A demonstration run for filming was also made around the circuit at Brands Hatch. Runs were also conducted at RNAY Wroughton near Swindon. By 1977 the team were ready for a high-speed run, planned for the long 10,000 foot runway of RAF Fairford The first high-speed run was planned for 7 March 1977, the day after Noble's thirty-first birthday. A successful first run was made from a standing start at idle thrust and gradual acceleration, reaching an estimated top speed of 180 mph. The second run was planned to be a drag start, with thrust built up against the brakes and then released. At around 140 mph though, a rear-wheel bearing seizedThe rear axle was from a normal production road car, including its differential casing and drum brakes. and the car went sideways, then rolled. The triple roll was mostly airborne and the car landed on its side, with relatively little damage. Noble was unhurt. The Derwent engine, and its protruding combustion chambers, took much of the damage. The jetpipe broke loose and at least one combustion chamber was crumpled. The car never ran again, and the wreckage was sold to a scrap dealer for ¬£175, after parts had been removed to ensure that it could never be run again. Despite the crash, Noble was not disheartened and saw this as the conclusion of the first step of his original plan. Successor By October of the same year, an engine had already been acquired for the next project, Thrust2 and this Rolls- Royce Avon was displayed at the London Motorfair to raise interest and sponsorship.Noble, Thrust, p. 51  Notes   References  Category:Jet land speed record cars ","title":"Thrust1"},{"id":"28256393","text":"Ka.

It is a Grade II* Listed Building. The church is located to the north of Stowe Pool on St Chad's Road. The current building dates back to the 12th century although extensive restorations and additions have been made in the centuries since. History Chad came to Lichfield a few years before he became Bishop of Lichfield in 669 CE for the purpose of religious solitude. He settled in a wood and led an eremitical life in a cell by the side of a spring. From this cell he was known to preach and baptize his converts in the spring. It is believed that the location of Chad's cell and spring was in the current churchyard. Interior of the church A monastery named the station of St Chad was built nearby the spring on the present site of the church around the time of St Chad. Of the original Saxon monastery nothing now remains. During the 12th Century the monastery was rebuilt as a church in stone and consisted of the nave, two side aisles and a chancel. The west door to the church stood where the tower now stands. The windows were set in gables and the lines of these gables and the rounded arches of the Norman windows in the south aisle are some of the oldest features still visible in today's building. During the 13th century the roof was replaced, the gables were dispensed with and the walls built up to the level of the window heads. The Norman windows were replaced with the Early English style pointed windows, still seen today. The south arcade of five bays with octagonal pillars is also Early English as is the chancel and the west doorway. The Tower on the west side was built in the 14th century to house the bells. The five-light chancel east window with cusped intersecting tracery was also built during this time as was the font, which is still in use today. The church was visited in 1323 by the Irish pilgrim Symon Semeonis on his way to the Holy Land. He described it as \\"a most beautiful church in honour of St. Chad, with most lofty stone towers, and splendidly adorned with pictures, sculptures, and other ecclesiastical ornaments.\\" During the Reformation many of the church's assets were confiscated. During the English Civil War the church was occupied by Parliamentary troops who besieged the Close of Lichfield, the church was considerably damaged and the roof had to be rebuilt. At this time the red brick clerestory was added and the single overall roof was replaced by three separate roofs, including a grained roof over the nave and panelled roof in the south aisle. Prominent as a curate in 1830‚Äì1837 was the eager high churchman William Gresley. In 1840 the decision was taken to demolish the north aisle and rebuild in a Victorian Gothic style. In 1862 the chancel and chancel arch were thoroughly restored and the brick clerestory extended over the chancel, a vestry was also added to the north side and the porch to the south. Further restoration work took place on the windows, the stained glass in the chancel and the east end of the south aisle seen today dates from this period. St Chad's Well The stone structure which stood over St Chad's Well from the 1830s to the 1950s. St Chad's Well is located in the churchyard to the north west of the church. The well is built over what was a spring and it is reputed that St Chad prayed on a stone at the spring, baptised his converts and healed peoples ailments in its sacred waters. This Holy well had become a popular place of pilgrimage by the 16th Century. In the 1830s James Rawson, a local physician, saw to it that the water supply was improved and an ornate octagonal stone structure was erected over the well. When the water dried up by the early 1920s, the well was lined with brick and a pump was fitted to the spring that fed it. The stone structure was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with the simple timber structure with tiled canopy we see today. The well is still a popular site of pilgrimage for both Anglicans and Catholics and it is traditionally decorated with flowers and greenery in a well dressing ceremony on Holy Thursday. The vines currently covering the canopy are a traditional Christian symbol referring to the Eucharistic wine. Other features =Monuments= The monuments in the church include two in the south wall of the chancel with Johnsonian connections. One is to Lucy Porter (d. 1786), Dr. Johnson's step-daughter. Below it is a memorial to Catherine Chambers (d. 1767), servant to Michael Johnson and his family. It was erected in 1910 after her tomb and that of Lucy Porter had been discovered during work on the chancel floor. A statue of St Chad was placed over the south porch in 1930 by Lady Blomefield in memory of her husband, Sir Thomas Blomefield of Windmill House (d. 1928). In 1949 a screen was erected across the tower arch in memory of Alderman J. R. Deacon (d. 1942) by his widow. The east end of the south aisle was formed into a Lady chapel in 1952 as a memorial to the fallen of the Second World War. =Bells= St Chad's has four bells in its tower, three of which date from the 17th Century and the fourth has an inscription dated 1255. At the Reformation, St Chad's was reported as having 'three bells and a sanctus bell'.

Early life Charles Herbert Best in a portrait photograph by Ronny Jaques The son of a bookmaker who died when he was run over by a train in the London Underground, during World War I Ronny Jaques was sent to boarding school in a coastal town on the Thames. The school was then moved to Bedford, in the middle of England, to avoid air raids. Jaques stayed there until the end of the war. When he was 9 years old, his mother closed his father's business and moved the family to Christie Lake in Canada. In 1925, Jaques moved to New York City with his brother Louis. During that time, he worked for Henry L. Dougherty, the founder of a gas company. In 1932 both brothers quit their jobs and went bicycling through Europe for two years. Jaques then enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London where he learned photography, remaining for about 8 months. He then moved to Canada where he opened the Ronny Jaques Studio at 24 Grenville Street in Toronto. In 1941, he closed the studio to focus on his photography career in NYC. Photography career Artist Paul Borduas photographed by Ronny Jaques During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s he worked as a photographer for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, Gourmet, Holiday and Town and Country for which he shot fashion, travel, foodKolasinski, O. R. (2009).

(Vol. 69, no.1) New Brunswick. Maclean-Hunter, Toronto. OCLC: 78364079 During his free time, Jaques took pictures at The Downbeat Club, a jazz club in New York, where he photographed celebrities such as Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, and Nat King Cole. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Ronny Jaques had a reputation for being low-key; he eschewed assistants and entourage and preferred to work without set-dressing or elaborate lighting. For his covers for Gourmet of the 1960s the dishes are often set against, or on, a photographic print to serve the magazine's increasing focus on travel by linking the food to a particular city or nation, rather than actually being photographed on location.Kolasinski, O. R. (2009). Forging Purity: Food Photography and the Mythology of American Cuisine (Doctoral dissertation, Reed College). Recognition From Jaques' magazine work, in 1955 curator Edward Steichen selected three of his photographs for the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man that was seen by 9 million visitors. In one close-up, three Canadian girls with grim expressions stand at a wire fence against a field that extends to a high horizon on which, in front of an overcast sky stands a house as square and simple as a child's drawing. Another, also shot in Canada, shows a late night in a bar with bentwood chairs stacked in the foreground in silhouette, and at the bottom of the frame sit two men drinking, one of whom throws back his head in laughter while a painting of a bare-breasted woman looks down on them. The third shows a broad tree-lined path in a Colombian park that is lit with dust-filtered low slanting light against which, at centre, appears a park labourer who kneels in prayer as a priest in a cassock passes, his sun umbrella held aloft by his male companion. Later life By the 1990s Ronny was living in Copenhagen, Denmark, with Lise, his third wife, and their two children, and Lulu, who was married with four children, and Jens-Louis. He died at the age of 98 in the summer of 2008.

This translation was published in 1939. Organised activities by the larger Ahmadiyya Muslim Community under the leadership of the Caliph began only after the Second World War when a centre was established. The movement has increasingly taken root in Germany since the 1980s through the arrival of South Asian immigrants and converts to Islam. The Ahmadi community in Germany consists mainly of Pakistani immigrants with a relatively small number of native German converts. Significant communities exist in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Bremen.Ahmadiyya Muslim Mosques Around the World, pg. 44 The Khadija Mosque in Berlin, designed and financed by Ahmadi Muslim women in Germany was opened in 2008. Acknowledgement with Church status in Germany Historically, due to the Landeskirchen concept, the organizational setup of the churches in Germany has always been in close interaction with the state administration and mirrored the territorial patchwork. As a legacy of the Prussian education system, the various confessions in Germany (including in the meanwhile Jewish and secular bodies as well) have contributed to primary and secondary education in Germany and do so still.

When it returned to Cobh on 25 June 1828, the ship's captain had brutally murdered seven of his crewmen. The story was largely forgotten until 2010, when The Ship of Seven Murders, a book which detailed the case, was published. Built in 1817, the Mary Russell was a small wooden brig of 132 tonnes, drawing 13 feet under load, single-decked with beams. That tonnage would make it about 80 feet in length. The ship was built entirely of wood, with wooden masts and rope rigging. The bottom was sheathed in copper to protect the vessel from shipworm. Crew The ship's captain was William Stewart, a Protestant man born in Cobh in 1775. His chief mate was a Scotsman named William Smith, and his second mate was a Swede named William Swanson. Also on board were John Cramer, the ship's carpenter; seamen John Howes, Francis Sullivan and John Keating; and three apprentices ‚Äì John Deaves (aged 15), Daniel Scully (13), and Henry Rickards (12). There were also two stablemen on board to look after the mules: Timothy Connell and James Morley. In addition to the crew, there was one passenger on board: an eleven-year-old boy named Thomas Hammond. Captain James Gould Raynes, a Cork man, who had sailed to Barbados on board Hibernia, was relieved of his command for drunkenness. After much persuasion, he was granted passage back to Cork by Captain Stewart on board the Mary Russell. Murders Following a dream, Captain Stewart grew suspicious of the crew and feared a mutiny led by Captain Raynes. That Raynes would speak in Irish to the crew added to Stewart's paranoia. Captain Stewart first bound the seven men by hand and foot, pinioning them to the floor of the ship's main saloon. He then systematically killed them all, attacking them first with a crowbar, and then with an axe. Trial On Sunday, 11 August 1828, Captain Stewart was tried for murder of Captain James Gould Raynes at Cork Assizes. Unusually, both prosecution and defence were seeking the same verdict: not guilty by reason of insanity. Daniel O‚ÄôConnell was engaged to appear for the prosecution at Stewart‚Äôs trial, but was unable to attend as he was fighting the pivotal by-election in County Clare that first elected him to the House of Commons.

Family background Ziatyk was born on the day after Christmas 1899, in the hamlet of Odrekhova near Sanok in southeastern Poland. He was the younger of two sons born to Maria and Stefan Ziatyk, his older sibling being called Mykhailo. The family were Ukrainian Rite Catholics. Stefan Ziatyk died when Ivan was 14 years of age. Ukrainian seminary In his late teenage years, Ziatyk decided to follow his calling from God and prepare for the Catholic priesthood. He entered the Ukrainian Catholic seminary in Przemy≈õl where he spent time studying Christian spirituality, philosophy, theology together with the history and Liturgy of the Ukrainian Rite Catholic Church. He was ordained to the diaconate and then priesthood in 1923. In 1925, Father Ivan returned to the seminary where he lectured in dogmatic theology as well as serving as spiritual director for the next ten years. Life as a Redemptorist For some time Father Ivan had desired to live a more austere life and, in 1935, made the decision to join the Redemptorists. Although he was an ordained priest, he was required to spend a year in the novitiate which was located near Lviv in western Ukraine, making his first profession in August 1936. During his first year as a Redemptorist, Father Ivan lived in the monastery dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ivano-Frankivsk (then called Stanislaviv) before moving to another monastery in Lviv, where he was both assistant superior and treasurer. Then, in 1938, he was appointed to teach dogmatic theology at the newly opened seminary in Holosko on the outskirts of present-day Lviv. In 1941, Father Ivan was made superior of the monastery dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God in Ternopil where he served before taking up the same position at in 1944. As well as being superior at Zboiska, he was engaged in the education of teenage boys interested in becoming Redemptorists. Persecution and death After the Second World War the Soviet regime renewed its oppression of Christian denominations; as Ukraine was part of the U.S.S.R. its people also suffered, but for a unique reason. The Soviets sought to abolish the Ukrainian Catholic Church by merging it with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which was considered easier to control as it was both state- sanctioned and did not acknowledge the spiritual leadership of the Bishop of Rome. All the bishops of the Ukrainian Catholic Church (also known by some as the Greek Catholic Church) found themselves placed under arrest in early 1946. Members of the Redemptorist order were gathered at the monastery in Holosko and placed under virtual arrest for the next two years as their activities were constantly monitored by the secret police. The members of the community were also subjected to periodic interrogation. Father Ivan came under particular scrutiny as he had become responsible for the leadership of Ukrainian Catholics. (When Archbishop Joseph Slipyj was arrested, he delegated the Belgian priest Joseph De Vocht to lead the Church. After De Vocht was expelled in 1948, Father Ivan took over). Eventually, Father Ivan was arrested in January 1950. At the end of his show trial (something not uncommon at that time) he was found guilty of promoting ‚Äú...the ideas of the Roman Pope, of spreading the Catholic Faith among the nations of the whole world and of making all Catholics.‚Äù and ‚Äúcooperating with anti-Soviet nationalistic organizations and anti-Soviet propaganda.‚Äù and sentenced to ten years hard labour. Ziatyk served time in prison, first at Zolochiv in western Ukraine and then at Ozernyi prison near Irkutsk in Siberia. Like many other priests and religious who were imprisoned by the Soviet regime, Father Ivan endured frequent interrogations, various deprivations and torture to persuade him to renounce his faith in Christ or at least abandon his Catholicism and convert to the state-sanctioned Orthodox Church; he refused to comply. In 1952, on Good Friday (the day on which Christians commemorate the salvific death of Christ) Father Ivan was drenched in water and beaten unconscious before being left outside in the Siberian cold. As a result of his injuries, he died a few days later and was buried in ‚Äú....Cemetery 373 in the Lake Baikal zone, in the district of Tajshet in the region of Irkyts‚Äôk‚Äù On 6 April 2001, the Holy See recognised Father Ivan Ziatyk as being a martyr and he was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 27 June, the feast of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the patroness of the Redemptorists.Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church website: Beatifications References Category:1899 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Beatified Redemptorists Category:Polish beatified people Category:Polish Roman Catholic priests Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Ivan Ziatyk"},{"id":"28256791","text":"The Chesapeake Raid was an American Revolutionary War campaign by British naval forces under the command of Commodore Sir George Collier and land forces led by Major General Edward Mathew.

It was developed by the European Commission together with the Member States of the European Union to speed up cross-border administrative cooperation. IMI allows public administrations at national, regional and local level to identify their counterparts in other countries and to exchange information with them. Pre-translated questions and answers as well as machine translation make it possible for them to use their own language to communicate. Background Internal market legislation of the European Union (EU) makes it mandatory for competent authorities in Member States to assist their counterparts abroad by providing them with information. Some legislation also requires communication between Member States and the European Commission (for example for the notification of national implementing measures of European Union law). IMI has been developed in order to facilitate this day-to-day exchange of information. IMI was launched in February 2008. Development and maintenance has been funded by the programme Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) since July 2010. ISA is the successor to the IDABC program, which initially funded IMI and came to an end on 31 December 2009. IMI is one of the governance tools of the Single Market. Other such tools are Your Europe, Your Europe Advice, Solvit and the Points of Single Contact. IMI applies a \\"Privacy by Design\\" approach ‚Äì integrating privacy and data protection compliance in all stages of the design of IMI ‚Äì which has been developed in consultation with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Administrative coordination is legally determinate and provided in a form of legal assistance between responsible institutions. In the case of the IMI system, administrative coordination encompasses some modes of administrative cooperation related to information provision (information exchange or data provision); shared administrative procedures execution (obligation to execute a single administrative decision/act by an institution from different Member States) and networking on a specific institutional structure (working of agencies or groups in formalised policy implementation processes)Civinskas, R., Dvorak, J., Guogis, A. (2017). The Administrative Side of Industrial Relations in Selected EU Countries: Case of Posted Workers. Montenegrin Journal of Economics, Vol. 13 (4), pp. 131‚Äì147 http://www.mnje.com/sites/mnje.com/files/131_-_148_-_z_12_-_civinskas_et_al.pdf Main Actors IMI has been rolled out in a decentralised way. Therefore, the practical implementation of IMI is the responsibility of the individual Member States. There are several actors that play a role in the IMI network. =Competent Authorities= Competent authorities are the end users of IMI. They are public bodies that have been given the responsibility to deal with certain elements of application of internal market legislation. They can function on national, regional or local level. =IMI Coordinators= There is one national IMI coordinator (NIMIC) per Member State, often located in a national ministry. Their task is to ensure the smooth operation of IMI in their country. IMI coordinators may delegate some of their responsibilities to additional coordinators who are in charge of, for example, one legislative area or a geographical region, depending on each Member State‚Äôs administrative structures. =European Commission= The European Commission is responsible for maintenance and development of the tool, helpdesk services and training. It also manages and supports the network of IMI coordinators, promotes further expansion of IMI and reports on the functioning of the system. IMI Workflows IMI offers a number of workflows to its users in order to facilitate different types of administrative cooperation across the Member states of the European Economic Area. =Information requests= When a competent authority needs information from a counterpart abroad, it can send a request for information. This exchange mechanism uses lists of pre-translated questions and answers available in all EU languages. It is also possible to attach documents. Only the competent authorities that are directly involved in an information exchange have access to the content. A practical example of an information request is when a German teacher would like to continue his activities in Portugal. The Portuguese authority needs to verify the authenticity of his scanned diploma. It can then use IMI to send an information request to its partner authority in Germany. This authority can accept the request and send an answer back to the authority in Portugal. Due to the pre-translated question and answer sets, both authorities can communicate in their own language. =Notifications= Notifications are based on one-to-many information exchanges where authorities can alert or notify one or more competent authorities and/or the European Commission. For example, the Services Directive requires that Member States alert each other of possible dangers to the health and safety of people or to the environment caused in the provision of services. =Information repositories= IMI information repositories are databases storing specific information for certain policy areas. An example of such a repository is the directory of registers maintained by competent authorities throughout the European Economic Area. This directory is equipped with multilingual search functions. The content of a repository can be accessed either by a restricted group of competent authorities or by all IMI users. Legal Framework IMI is used in all Member States of the European Economic Area for the administrative cooperation required by the Directive on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC), by the Directive on services in the internal market (2006/123/EC) and, on a pilot basis, by the Posting of Workers Directive. Since November 2012, it provides a repository for information on licence holders for the cross-border road transport of Euro cash and an IT platform for the problem solving network Solvit. IMI is being expanded to cover further legislative areas. For example, the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross- border Healthcare. IMI aims to \\"become a flexible toolkit at the service of administrative cooperation, contributing to the improved governance of the Internal Market.\\" The IMI Regulation which came into force in December 2012 is an EU law establishing a comprehensive legal framework for IMI. It provides a complete set of rules for the processing of personal data in IMI and prescribes a method for future expansion of IMI to additional policy areas.

The Bihaƒá Republic (Serbo-Croatian Latin: Bihaƒáka Republika, Cyrillic: –ë–∏—Ö–∞—õ–∫–∞ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞) was a short-lived republic that existed between November 1942 and January 1943 in a liberated area of Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia. It was established by the Partisan resistance movement following the liberation of Bihaƒá. Bihaƒá became its administrative center and the first session of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) was held there on 26 November 1942.  Liberation of the territory  In the summer and fall of 1942 partisan forces improved largely its organization and tactics. Organized in mobile brigades, partisans were able to attack and overpower isolated Axis garrisons of battalion size and, in some cases, even stronger. Partisan units in western Bosnia and Croatia were largely reinforced with arrival of 6 brigades from eastern parts of Yugoslavia in summer 1942. Bihaƒá, the central town of the territory, was liberated on 4 November 1942 after a two-day battle of 8 Krajina and Croatian brigades against the 4th Usta≈°a Brigade and 12th Croatian Home Guard Regiment. Some towns were liberated earlier (Vojniƒá, Vrginmost, Korenica, Drvar, Glamoƒç, Bosanski Petrovac), and others were liberated in continuation of the Bihaƒá operation: Bosanska Krupa on 5, Cazin on 6, and Slunj on 14 November. Several towns were liberated during separate attacks: Jajce on 26 November, Livno on 15 December, Tomislavgrad on 19 December 1942, and Tesliƒá on 1 January 1943. Udbina and Bosansko Grahovo were evacuated by usta≈°a and Italian units under partisan pressure. Some towns were attacked unsuccessfully: Bosanski Novi and Dvor na Uni on 26‚Äì28 November, and Sanski Most on 10‚Äì22 December. With these operations, large swaths of territory, from Karlovac in the west to Prozor in the east, were cleared of Axis forces. Partisans established control over an area that was some 250 km long and 50‚Äì70 km wide.

It is also called the exponential growth rate, or the continuous growth rate. Rationale RGR is a concept relevant in cases where the increase in a state variable over time is proportional to the value of that state variable at the beginning of a time period. In terms of differential equations, if S is the current size, and \\\\frac{dS}{dt} its growth rate, then relative growth rate is :\\\\frac{1}{S}\\\\frac{dS}{dt}. If the relative growth rate is constant, i.e., :\\\\frac{1}{S}\\\\frac{dS}{dt} = k, a solution to this equation is :S_t = \\\\exp^{(kt)}. A closely related concept is doubling time. Calculations In the simplest case of observations at two time points, RGR is calculated using the following equation: :RGR \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{(\\\\ln S_2 - \\\\ln S_1)}{(t_2-t_1)}, where: \\\\ln = natural logarithm t_1 = time one (e.g. in days) t_2 = time two (e.g. in days) S_1 = size at time one S_2 = size at time two When calculating or discussing relative growth rate, it is important to pay attention to the units of time being considered. For example, if an initial population of S_0bacteria doubles every twenty minutes, then at time interval T it is given by the equation :S_T \\\\ = \\\\ S_0 2^T = S_0 \\\\exp^{(\\\\ln(2)\\\\cdot T)}, where T is the number of twenty-minute intervals that have passed. However, we usually prefer to measure time in hours or minutes, and it is not difficult to change the units of time. For example, since 1 hour is 3 twenty-minute intervals, the population in one hour is S(3)=S_0 2^3. The hourly growth factor is 8, which means that for every 1 at the beginning of the hour, there are 8 by the end. Indeed, :S_t = S_0 8^t = S_0 \\\\exp^{(\\\\ln(8)\\\\cdot T)} where t is measured in hours, and the relative growth rate may be expressed as \\\\ln(2) or approximately 69% per twenty minutes, and as \\\\ln(8) or approximately 208% per hour. RGR of plants In plant physiology, RGR is widely used to quantify the speed of plant growth. It is part of a set of equations and conceptual models that are commonly referred to as Plant growth analysis, and is further discussed in that section.

This analysis can be applied to heat engines and pumps, including the heart. A considerable amount of information on cardiac performance can be determined from the pressure vs. volume plot (pressure‚Äìvolume diagram). A number of methods have been determined for measuring PV-loop values experimentally.  Cardiac pressure‚Äìvolume loops Figure 1: Idealized pressure‚Äìvolume diagram featuring cardiac cycle components. Real-time left ventricular (LV) pressure‚Äìvolume loops provide a framework for understanding cardiac mechanics in experimental animals and humans. Such loops can be generated by real-time measurement of pressure and volume within the left ventricle. Several physiologically relevant hemodynamic parameters such as stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection fraction, myocardial contractility, etc. can be determined from these loops. To generate a PV loop for the left ventricle, the LV pressure is plotted against LV volume at multiple time points during a single cardiac cycle.  Cardiac terminology  = Afterload = Afterload is the mean tension produced by a chamber of the heart in order to contract. It can also be considered as the ‚Äòload‚Äô that the heart must eject blood against. Afterload is, therefore, a consequence of aortic large vessel compliance, wave reflection, and small vessel resistance (LV afterload) or similar pulmonary artery parameters (RV afterload). Left ventricular afterload is affected by various disease conditions. Hypertension increases the afterload, since the LV has to work harder to overcome the elevated arterial peripheral resistance and decreased compliance. Aortic valve diseases like aortic stenosis and insufficiency also increase the afterload, whereas mitral valve regurgitation decreases the afterload. = Preload = Preload is described as the stretching of a single cardiac myocyte immediately prior to contraction and is, therefore, related to the sarcomere length. Since sarcomere length cannot be determined in the intact heart, other indices of preload such as ventricular end-diastolic volume or pressure are used. As an example, preload increases when venous return is increased. This is because the end-diastolic pressure and volume of the ventricle are increased, which stretches the sarcomeres. Preload can be calculated as :\\\\text{preload} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{LVEDP} \\\\times \\\\text{LVEDR}}{2\\\\text{h}} where :* LVEDP = left ventricular end- diastolic pressure :* LVEDR = left ventricular end-diastolic radius (at midpoint of ventricle) :* h = thickness of ventricle  Pressure‚Äìvolume parameters  = Stroke volume = Stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood ejected by the right/left ventricle in a single contraction. It is the difference between the end-diastolic volume (EDV) and the end-systolic volume (ESV). In mathematical terms, \\\\text{SV} = \\\\text{EDV} - \\\\text{ESV} The stroke volume is affected by changes in preload, afterload, and inotropy (contractility). In normal hearts, the SV is not strongly influenced by afterload, whereas, in failing hearts, the SV is highly sensitive to afterload changes. Stroke volume essentially matches the term Ejection Fraction. = Stroke work = Ventricular stroke work (SW) is defined as the work performed by the left or right ventricle to eject the stroke volume into the aorta or pulmonary artery, respectively. The area enclosed by the PV loop is a measure of the ventricular stroke work, which is a product of the stroke volume and the mean aortic or pulmonary artery pressure (afterload), depending on whether one is considering the left or the right ventricle. = Cardiac output = Cardiac output (CO) is defined as the amount of blood pumped by the ventricle in unit time. In mathematical terms, \\\\text{CO} = \\\\text{SV} \\\\times \\\\text{Heart Rate}. CO is an indicator of how well the heart is performing its function of transporting blood to deliver oxygen, nutrients, and chemicals to various cells of the body and to remove the cellular wastes. CO is regulated principally by the demand for oxygen by the cells of the body. Physiologic relevance Diseases of the cardiovascular system, such as hypertension and heart failure, are often associated with changes in CO. Cardiomyopathy and heart failure cause a reduction in cardiac output, whereas infection and sepsis are known to increase cardiac output. Hence, the ability to accurately measure CO is important in physiology, as it provides for improved diagnosis of abnormalities, and can be used to guide the development of new treatment strategies. However, CO is dependent upon loading conditions and is inferior to hemodynamic parameters defined by the PV plane. = Ejection fraction = Ejection fraction (EF) is defined as the fraction of end-diastolic volume that is ejected out of the ventricle during each contraction. In mathematical terms, \\\\text{EF} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{SV}}{\\\\text{EDV}} Healthy ventricles typically have ejection fractions greater than 0.55. However, EF is also dependent on loading conditions and inferior to hemodynamic parameters defined by the PV plane.  Physiologic relevance  Myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy causes damage to the myocardium, which impairs the heart's ability to eject blood and, therefore, reduces ejection fraction. This reduction in the ejection fraction can manifest itself as heart failure. Low EF usually indicates systolic dysfunction, and severe heart failure can result in EF lower than 0.2. EF is also used as a clinical indicator of the inotropy (contractility) of the heart. Increasing inotropy leads to an increase in EF, whereas decreasing inotropy decreases EF. = dP/dtmin & dP/dtmax = These represent the minimum and maximum rate of pressure change in the ventricle. Peak dP/dt has historically been used as an index of ventricular performance. However, it is known to be load-dependent and inferior to hemodynamic parameters defined by the PV plane. An increase in contractility is manifested as an increase in dP/dtmax during isovolumic contraction. However, dP/dtmax is also influenced by preload, afterload, heart rate, and myocardial hypertrophy. Hence, the relationship between ventricular end-diastolic volume and dP/dt is a more accurate index of contractility than dP/dt alone. Likewise, an increase in diastolic function or an increase in relaxation (lusitropy) causes increased dP/dtmin during isovolumic relaxation. Hence, dP/dtmin has been used as a valuable tool in the analysis of isovolumic relaxation. However, studies have shown that this parameter may not be a valid measure of LV relaxation rate, especially during acute alterations in contractility or afterload. = Isovolumic relaxation constant (Œ§au) = Figure 2. Calculation of Tau (Glantz method) Tau represents the exponential decay of the ventricular pressure during isovolumic relaxation. Several studies have shown that Tau is a preload-independent measure of isovolumic relaxation. The accurate estimation of Tau is highly dependent on the accuracy of ventricular pressure measurements. Thus, high fidelity pressure transducers are required to obtain real time instantaneous ventricular pressures. Calculation of Tau (Glantz method) \\\\text{P}(\\\\text{t}) = \\\\text{P}_0 e^{\\\\frac{-\\\\text{t}}{\\\\tau_E}} + \\\\text{P}_{\\\\alpha} where :* P = pressure at time t :* P0 = amplitude constant :* œÑE = Glantz relaxation constant :* PŒ± = non zero asymptote due to pleural and pericardial pressure  PV loop analysis  Due to the load dependency of the previous parameters, more accurate measures of ventricular function are available in the PV plane. = End-systolic pressure volume relationship = Pressure-Volume loops showing end-systolic pressure volume relationship End- systolic pressure volume relationship (ESPVR) describes the maximal pressure that can be developed by the ventricle at any given LV volume. This implies that the PV loop cannot cross over the line defining ESPVR for any given contractile state. The slope of ESPVR (Ees) represents the end-systolic elastance, which provides an index of myocardial contractility. The ESPVR is relatively insensitive to changes in preload, afterload, and heart rate. This makes it an improved index of systolic function over other hemodynamic parameters like ejection fraction, cardiac output, and stroke volume. The ESPVR becomes steeper and shifts to the left as inotropy (contractility) increases. The ESPVR becomes flatter and shifts to the right as inotropy decreases. = End-diastolic pressure volume relationship = End-diastolic pressure volume relationship. End-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR) describes the passive filling curve for the ventricle and thus the passive properties of the myocardium. The slope of the EDPVR at any point along this curve is the reciprocal of ventricular compliance (or ventricular stiffness). For example, if ventricular compliance is decreased (such as in ventricular hypertrophy), the ventricle is stiffer. This results in higher ventricular end-diastolic pressures (EDP) at any given end-diastolic volume (EDV). Alternatively, for a given EDP, a less compliant ventricle would have a smaller EDV due to impaired filling. If ventricular compliance increases (such as in dilated cardiomyopathy where the ventricle becomes highly dilated without appreciable thickening of the wall), the EDV may be very high but the EDP may not be greatly elevated. = Pressure-volume area = The Pressure- volume area (PVA) represents the total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction. This is equal to the sum of the stroke work (SW), encompassed within the PV loop, and the elastic potential energy (PE). In mathematical terms, \\\\text{PVA} = \\\\text{PE} + \\\\text{SW} also, \\\\text{PE} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{PES}(\\\\text{VES} - \\\\text{V}_0)}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\text{PED}(\\\\text{VED} - \\\\text{V}_0)}{4} where * PES = end-systolic pressure * PED = end-diastolic pressure * VES = end-systolic volume * VED = end-diastolic volume * V0 ‚Äì theoretical volume when no pressure is generated  Physiologic relevance  Pressure-volume area plot. There is a highly linear correlation between the PVA and cardiac oxygen consumption per beat. This relationship holds true under a variety of loading and contractile conditions. This estimation of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) is used to study the coupling of mechanical work and the energy requirement of the heart in various disease states, such as diabetes, ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. MVO2 is also used in the calculation of cardiac efficiency, which is the ratio of cardiac stroke work to MVO2. = Preload recruitable stroke work = Preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) is determined by the linear regression of stroke work with the end-diastolic volume. The slope of the PRSW relationship is a highly linear index of myocardial contractility that is insensitive to preload and afterload.  Physiologic relevance  Preload recruitable stroke work. During heart failure, myocardial contractility is reduced, which decreases the slope of the PRSW relationship. Recent studies also indicate that the volume axis intercept of the PRSW relationship (not the slope) may be a better indicator of the severity of contractile dysfunction. = Frank‚ÄìStarling curve = Frank‚ÄìStarling curve. ‚ÄúThe heart will pump what it receives‚Äù- Starling‚Äôs law of the heart The Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism describes the ability of the heart to change its force of contraction (and, hence, stroke volume) in response to changes in venous return. In other words, if the end-diastolic volume increases, there is a corresponding increase in stroke volume. The Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism can be explained on the basis of preload. As the heart fills with more blood than usual, there is an increase in the load experienced by each myocyte. This stretches the muscle fibers, increasing the affinity of troponin C to Ca2+ ions, causing a greater number of cross- bridges to form within the muscle fibers. This increases the contractile force of the cardiac muscle, resulting in increased stroke volume. Frank‚ÄìStarling curves can be used as an indicator of muscle contractility (inotropy). However, there is no single Frank‚ÄìStarling curve on which the ventricle operates but rather a family of curves, each of which defined by the afterload and inotropic state of the heart. Increased afterload or decreased inotropy shifts the curve down and to the right. Decreased afterload and increased inotropy shifts the curve up and to the left. = Arterial elastance = Arterial elastance Arterial elastance (Ea) is a measure of arterial load and is calculated as the simple ratio of ventricular end-systolic pressure to stroke volume. In mathematical terms, \\\\text{E}_\\\\text{a} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{ESP}}{\\\\text{SV}} = \\\\text{Heart Rate} \\\\times \\\\text{Resistance} By characterizing both the ventricular and arterial systems in terms of pressure and stroke volume, it is possible to study the ventriculo-arterial coupling (the interaction between the heart and the arterial system).  PV loop changes for diverse cardiac abnormalities  = Dilated cardiomyopathy = Dilated Cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy, the ventricle becomes dilated without compensatory thickening of the wall. The LV is unable to pump enough blood to meet the metabolic demands of the organism. The end-systolic and diastolic volumes increase and the pressures remain relatively unchanged. The ESPVR and EDPVR curves are shifted to the right. = Left ventricular hypertrophy = Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an increase in the thickness and mass of the myocardium. This could be a normal reversible response to cardiovascular conditioning (athletic heart) or an abnormal irreversible response to chronically increased volume load (preload) or increased pressure load (afterload). Shown is a diagram of pathological hypertrophy reducing EDV and SV. The thickening of the ventricular muscle results in decreased chamber compliance. As a result, LV pressures are elevated, the ESV is increased, and the EDV is decreased, causing an overall reduction in cardiac output. :There are two exceptions to this. Increased left ventricular hypertrophy with increased EDV and SV is seen with athletes and in healthy normal elderly individuals. Moderate hypertrophy allows for a lower heart rate, increased diastolic volume, and thus higher stroke volume. = Restrictive cardiomyopathy = Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy includes a group of heart disorders in which the walls of the ventricles become stiff (but not necessarily thickened) and resist normal filling with blood between heartbeats. This condition occurs when heart muscle is gradually infiltrated or replaced by scar tissue or when abnormal substances accumulate in the heart muscle. The ventricular systolic pressure remains normal, diastolic pressure is elevated and the cardiac output is reduced. = Valve diseases =  Aortic stenosis  Aortic stenosis Aortic valve stenosis is abnormal narrowing of the aortic valve. This results in much greater LV pressures than the aortic pressures during LV ejection. The magnitude of the pressure gradient is determined by the severity of the stenosis and the flow rate across the valve. Severe aortic stenosis results in #reduced ventricular stroke volume due to increased afterload (which decreases ejection velocity) # increased end-systolic volume # compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume and pressure  Mitral stenosis  Mitral stenosis This is a narrowing of the mitral valve orifice when the valve is open. Mitral stenosis impairs LV filling so that there is a decrease in end-diastolic volume (preload). This leads to a decrease in stroke volume by the Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism and a fall in cardiac output and aortic pressure. This reduction in afterload (in particular, aortic diastolic pressure) enables the end-systolic volume to decrease slightly but not enough to overcome the decline in end-diastolic volume. Therefore, because end-diastolic volume decreases more than end- systolic volume decreases, the stroke volume decreases.  Aortic regurgitation  Aortic regurgitation Aortic insufficiency (AI) is a condition in which the aortic valve fails to close completely at the end of systolic ejection, causing leakage of blood back through the valve during LV diastole. The constant backflow of blood through the leaky aortic valve implies that there is no true phase of isovolumic relaxation. The LV volume is greatly increased due to the enhanced ventricular filling. When the LV begins to contract and develop pressure, blood is still entering the LV from the aorta (since aortic pressure is higher than LV pressure), implying that there is no true isovolumic contraction. Once the LV pressure exceeds the aortic diastolic pressure, the LV begins to eject blood into the aorta. The increased end-diastolic volume (increased preload) activates the Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism to increase the force of contraction, LV systolic pressure, and stroke volume.  Mitral regurgitation  Mitral regurgitation Mitral regurgitation (MR) occurs when the mitral valve fails to close completely, causing blood to flow back into the left atrium during ventricular systole. The constant backflow of blood through the leaky mitral valve implies that there is no true phase of isovolumic contraction. Since the afterload imposed on the ventricle is reduced, end-systolic volume can be smaller than normal. There is also no true period of isovolumic relaxation because some LV blood flows back into the left atrium through the leaky mitral valve. During ventricular diastolic filling, the elevated atrial pressure is transmitted to the LV during filling so that LV end-diastolic volume (and pressure) increases. This would cause the afterload to increase if it were not for the reduced outflow resistance (due to mitral regurgitation) that tends to decrease afterload during ejection. The net effect of these changes is that the width of the PV loop is increased (i.e., ventricular stroke volume is increased). However, ejection into the aorta (forward flow) is reduced. The increased ventricular stroke volume in this case includes the volume of blood ejected into the aorta as well as the volume ejected back into the left atrium.

For husking rice the Mizos used wooden mortar and pestle which were called ‚ÄòSum‚Äô and ‚ÄòSuk‚Äô. During the break of their tiresome rice husking which was done mainly by women the Mizo youngsters used this rice pounding wooden pestle ‚ÄòSuk‚Äô to exhibit their manly prowess. There were different games using Suk as instrument. are well known in addition to this rod pushing game. Sukkhawh is throwing Suk like a javelin, and Insukherh is a game in which two players holding Suk at each end and twisting with force to out play the opponent. Of all these games, Insuknawr was the most popular among the Mizos.

It is named FnrS because its expression is strongly dependent on fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator (FNR), a direct oxygen availability sensor. A conserved intergenic region between genes ydaN and dbpA was predicted to encode an sRNA, adjacent to where another non- coding RNA (C0343) has been identified. However, northern blot analysis of this 477bp sequence yielded no results. A subsequent tiling array analysis sequencing Hfq-binding sRNA found that the Watson strand did indeed encode an sRNA. Gene regulation FnrS has been shown to downregulate 32 different mRNAs in Enterobacteria, in 15 of these cases it does so by base-pairing with the mRNA transcript. The majority of genes downregulated by FnrS are required for aerobic metabolism or the oxidative stress response. Some of the genes downregulated by FnrS are: *adhP - an alcohol dehydrogenase involved in metabolism *cydD - zinc sensitive ATP-binding component of cytochrome-related transport *mqo - membrane associated malate:quinone oxidoreductase which operates in the citric acid cycle *sodB/A - a superoxide dismutase which aids with oxygen stress resistance *ygiW - a hypothetical outer membrane protein A study incorporating comparative target prediction and subsequent experimental verification of selected predictions, suggests that FnrS might be a more global regulator in Escherichia coli. It is predicted to control several transcription factors. These include the verified targets marA and IscR. MarA activates genes involved in the resistance to superoxide, which might not be necessary at the anaerobic conditions where FnrS is expressed. IscR regulates genes for iron-sulfur-cluster containing or biogenesis proteins. FnrS might be involved in the observed O2 dependent expression of the IscR regulon. Further targets of FnrS are nagZ and sdhA. There is also evidence to suggest that the expression of FnrS is regulated by the RcsCDB signalling system in Salmonella enterica.

The marching band is the largest student organization on campus and the university's largest for-credit course. Under the leadership of Dr. Sid Hearn, the Marian University Marching Band took the field for the first time on September 19, 2009. Since then, the band has performed for many prestigious events on and off campus. The band performs for home football games, parades, pep rallies, campus sporting events, community concerts, and private events. Recently, the Marian University Marching Band has become widely requested as an exhibition band for high school band competitions across the Midwest, performing headline exhibitions at various Bands of America events since 2010 including the Indianapolis Public Schools Tournament of Bands portion of the Grand National Championships at Lucas Oil Stadium, Super Regional in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, and Finals portion of the Grand National Championships at Lucas Oil Stadium . History In 1964, student John Sweany had a vision to bring the excitement that he experienced through his high school marching band to Marian College. With only six classmates and some bargain instruments, John formed the Marian Blue Knights‚Äîthe first non-military collegiate Drum and Bugle Corps in the United States. Through dedication and skill, Sweany was able to take his corps to unexpected heights and provide the heartbeat of the campus for 12 years. During its existence, the Marian Blue Knights performed at: Holland Tulip Festival Indianapolis 500 Festival Parade Niagara Falls Blossom Festival Kentucky Derby Parade United States Capitol Walt Disney World Washington, D. C. For over a decade, the corps was the heartbeat of the Marian College campus until it became inoperative in the late 1970s. In 1984, one of the most successful drum and bugle corps in the history of DCI rose from the ashes of the defunct Marian College Blue Knights when the Star of Indiana was founded in Bloomington using Marian College Blue Knight bugles and equipment. Rebirth With the formation of a football team in 2007, Marian University president Daniel J. Elsener sought to create a marching band that could provide fans with that \\"college\\" atmosphere during games. This simple goal has blossomed into the brightest new program in the state. During the 2009 season, the band fielded a drum line and horn line. Color Guard was added for the 2010 season, and 2011 saw the addition of pit percussion. In 2012, Marian University fielded its first Winter Guard as competitive members of the MidWest Color Guard Circuit and qualified as a finalist in the Independent A classification during this first season. The winter guard, known as \\"Knightro\\" of Marian University, made their Winter Guard International debut in 2013 at the Southeastern Regional in Chattanooga, TN and was named the 2013 Independent Open Class Silver Medalists at the MidWest Color Guard Circuit Championships. Unparalleled support from the Marian University faculty, students, and the Indianapolis community, has ensured that the bands program will continue to grow and improve.

It was founded on April 25, 2010 by Louis Carlet, Dave Ashton, Tony Dolan and others. It is a \\"godo roso\\" general amalgamated union, the first ever in Japan with an most-foreign top executive. Although membership is not restricted to any particular industry, Tozen's members tend to be from the publishing, banking, universities and foreign language teaching industries, with most members located in the Kanto region. The union is known for high standards of democracy, transparency, multi-nationalism and for active use of the right to strike. The executive is composed of 18 members, including President Hifumi Okunuki, Chief Financial Officer is Louis Carlet, and Field Director Gerome Rothman. Founding of the union Tozen Union was created when foreign and Japanese members of National Union of General Workers Tokyo Nambu defected. The NUGW is an older union which traces its roots back to 1956, with the founding of . In 1994, the National Union of General Workers Tokyo South was formed, then renamed NUGW Tokyo Nambu in 2003. In 2004, the Foreign Workers Caucus was formed inside Nambu, which would eventually come to have 11 local branches. On April 25, 2010, six of these branches voted to separate from Nambu and form Tozen. Other Nambu branches followed later. Tozen obtained official corporate registration in July 2010, according to its own website. While Tozen uses General Union in its name, it is not affiliated in any way to the General Union, Fukuoka General Union and the National Union of General Workers Tokyo Nambu. Tozen and General Union both have locals/branches at Gaba, Nova, Bunsai Gakuen, Shane, Berlitz and Interac. Locals Tozen has a number of local unions at different workplaces, including: The Japan Times, Linguaphone, Philippine National Bank, Syndicat des Employ√©s de l‚ÄôInstitut Franco-japonais, Lyce√© Franco-japonais, Sophia University, Gaba, Apple Japan, Japan College of Foreign Languages, Nichibei Eikaiwa, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Simul Academy, Coco Juku (Nichii Gakkan), Mitsui Fuso, NCC, English Express, and Shane English School. Tozen also represents ALTs at various companies as well as university workers and teachers. Actions Tozen is an activist union, and has taken action through the courts and industrial relations bureaucracy a number of times as well as engaging in strikes, leafleting, demonstrations, rallies and freedom of information campaigns. Tozen strikes more than any other union in Japan. Tozen President (former Paralegal) Hifumi Okunuki began in February 2012 a column in the Japan Times called Labor Pains, in which she details famous labor law court cases.Court Backs Right to StrikeTepco Liable to Workers Then Executive President Louis Carlet on March 11, 2011, spoke to Democracy Now! about the situation in Tokyo after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Tozen was cited by the U.S. State Department's human rights report on Japan for the union's long campaign to enroll teachers in shakai hoken health and pension insurance. Tozen also spoke with political activist Noam Chomsky in March 2014. Visit to Iceland Between February 27 and March 11, 2019 Tozen Union President Hifumi Okunuki, Chief Financial Officer Louis Carlet, and Field Director (and Rengo Trade Union Confederation Executive) Gerome Rothman participated in a guest lecture series organized by Iceland's second largest labour union, Efling. Based on an invitation from Efling's Organizing Division (F√©lagssvi√∞), on March 3, 2019 Tozen Union gave a presentation about its structure, history, range of activity, and the basics of Japanese labour law. The event was live-streamed. And on March 5, 2019 Tozen Union led a workshop on the subject of workplace organizing. On March 8, 2019 Hifumi Okunuki, and Louis Carlet were interviewed by Icelandic television about Efling's one-day maids' strike covering the whole of Reykjav√≠k, which took place on the same date. Notable Legal Victories = The Language of Labour Relations = While most foreign workers in Japan are employed in the context of their native language, or English, both at the time of hiring and during their day-to-day workplace operations, employers typically attempt to dominate foreign union members by refusing to negotiate in the language of the workplace. In response Tozen Union invented and endeavours to establish the concept of The Language of Labour Relations, which contends that employers are not allowed to suddenly use a different language when their employees begin Collective Bargaining. In a 2016 Tokyo Labour Commission ruling on Tozen Union's case against Tokyo Gakugei University, the Commission established that employers is not allowed to unilaterally establish the conditions of Collective Bargaining, confirming that this includes the language in which negotiations will take place. = The Right to Strike for Independent Contractors = In an October 2019 Tokyo Labour Commission ruling, the Commission established that teachers hired by Gaba Corporation as independent contractors have the right to strike. Tozen union and its Gaba Union Local sued Gaba Corporation to overturn warning letters issued to striking teachers. Gaba Corporation claimed that its over 1000 teachers were independent contractors, and thus were not protected by the rights of workers and Japan's Trade Union act. In a previous Osaka Labour Commission case, the Commission had recognized these employees' right to Collectively Bargain. Gaba Corporation management tried to nullify the impact of the ruling by claiming that even if the teachers had the right to Collective Bargaining, they didn't have the right to strike, which the Tokyo Labour Commission rejected based on Tozen's arguments. In Japan, the right to Solidarity, Collective Bargaining, and Collective Action (including strikes) are set in Article 28 of the Constitution, and cannot be divided.

So, here it becomes clear that the Real-Time Delphi approach requires real-time calculation and provision of group responses. Friedewald et al. further state that the Real-Time Delphi method has beneath its explorative and predictive elements also normative and communicative elements. These latter are investigated by Bolognini,. The author argues that computer-based Delphi can be especially relevant in the context of e-democracy, not only for the roundless approach, the real-time updating of statistical response, or the large number of panellists, but for the possibility to establish split panels corresponding to different groups (such as policy-makers, experts, and citizens), which the administrator can give different tasks and privileges, depending on the issues and the type of decision-making process. who explores the potential of computer-based Delphi as a communication technique for electronic democracy. Comparative studies of von der Gracht and colleagues have revealed that Real-time Delphi studies are comparable to the outcome of conventional round-based Delphi surveys. Validating an Innovative Real-Time Delphi Approach ‚Äì A methodological comparison between real-time and conventional Delphi studies. In: Technological Forecasting & Social Change. 78, 9, 2011, p. 1681‚Äì1694, doi:10.1016/j.techfore.2011.04.006. History The basic idea of a real-time, therefore computer-based (usually web-based), Delphi approach originates in a paper published by Turoff back in 1972 about an online Delphi conference conducted in the United States.Turoff, M. (1972). Delphi Conferencing: Computer-Based Conferencing with Anonymity. Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 3, 159-204. The conference was characterized by remote locations of participants, an online tool to access and give judgments, anonymity of the participants, continuous operations and analysis of results (i.e. participants were able to see given answers of the other participants in real-time), as well as asynchronous participation (i.e. participants could independently login and logout how often and when they desired). The stated aspects are some of the key characteristics of Real-Time Delphi studies, which shows that the original idea of conducting such studies can be traced back to the respective year. Today, nevertheless, technological innovations and advanced computer aided design possibilities (e.g. high-speed internet connections, high definition graphic, and advanced processor performance) facilitate more sophisticated studies in this context.H√§der, M. (2002). Delphi-Befragungen. Ein Arbeitsbuch. Wiesbaden: Westdeutscher Verlag. The general idea to develop a faster advanced form of Delphi studies by using ideas and basic concepts of Turoff, was initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which awarded a grant in 2004 to develop an approach to improve ‚Äúspeed and efficiency of collecting judgments in tactical situations‚Äù. A small software company named Articulate Software in San Francisco was awarded an innovation research grant to develop what DARPA was asking for. Adam Pease, principal consultant and CEO of Articulate Software, published the findings and methodology together with Theodore Gordon in 2006. Based on the findings in this seminal paper, Heiko von der Gracht developed a second Real-time Delphi platform until 2008. In subsequent years, von der Gracht and colleagues used the platform extensively for prospective research studies. In 2011, von der Gracht and Gordon presented a joint paper at WFS Annual Summit 2011, which summarizes the lessons learned of 40 RTD studies across the two platforms.

Differences between conventional and real-time Delphi method The question arises how a Real-Time Delphi study differs from a Conventional Delphi study. The basic framework is to think of a Delphi study which is conducted in form of an online questionnaire. However, a Conventional round-based Delphi study conducted via the internet is called ‚ÄúInternet Delphi‚Äù. The basic difference to Internet Delphi is that the process of a Real-Time Delphi is not characterised by single iterated rounds. In fact, real-time calculation and provision of responses are the key characteristics of Real-Time Delphis. Various other labels for Real-Time Delphi can be found in literature and many authors are not completely aware of the differences:Turoff, M., & Hiltz, S. (1995). Computer based Delphi processes. In M. Adler & E. Ziglio, E. (Eds.), Gazing into the Oracle: The Delphi Method and its Application to Social Policy and Public Health (pp. 56-88). London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers. ‚ÄúElectronic Delphi‚Äù, ‚ÄúComputer Delphi‚Äù, ‚ÄúComputer-aided Delphi‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTechnology Delphi‚Äù. However, it is important to truly understand the design and process a researcher has chosen to find out whether real-time calculations and provisions have been applied or not. The typical Real-Time Delphi process can be described in the way that participants get access to an online questionnaire portal for a certain time frame, within which they are allowed to log in and log out as often as they want. Whenever they login, they will see all their quantitative and qualitative answers of previous sessions and they can change all answers as desired within the given period of time. Besides their own answers they will see the ongoing ‚Äì hence, real-time ‚Äì responses of other participants, and with regard to metric assessments the group as a whole will be visualised in terms of median, average, and interquartile range (IQR). It has to be pointed out that the numerical visualisations as well as the qualitative inputs change in the course of other participants changing their responses. Consequently, a participant can find out to what extent his own responses from an earlier point of time are still within the group opinion (i.e. IQR). The core innovation, then, of Real-Time Delphi studies is the real-time calculation and provision of results.Monguet, J., Ferruzca, M., Guti√©rrez, A., Alatriste, Y., Mart√≠nez, C., Cordoba, C., Fern√°ndez, J., et al. (2010). Vector Consensus: Decision Making for Collaborative Innovation Communities. Communications in Computer and Information Science (Vol. 110, pp. 218‚Äì227). Viana do Castelo, Portugal: Springer. doi:10.1007/978-3-642-16419-4_22 Methodological advancements The core methodological innovation of Real-Time Delphi studies are the absence of iterated rounds and the real-time calculation and provision of group responses. Whereas Conventional Delphi studies are characterised by repeating sequential rounds, the Real-Time Delphi approach is characterised by a continuous round-less procedure leading to a reduced time frame needed to conduct such studies.Gordon, T. J. (2007). Energy forecasts using a ‚ÄúRoundless‚Äù approach to running a Delphi study. Foresight, 9(2), 27-35. Consequently, conducting large-scale studies of huge complexity in a relatively short period of time becomes possible. Another core methodological innovation is the fact that experts may not only judge once or twice, depending on the number of rounds, as it has been usual in a Conventional Delphi study. During a Real-Time Delphi, experts can independently reassess their responses as often as they want. Hartman and Baldwin discuss further advantages of the Real-Time Delphi approach: First, the number of experts participating in the real-time study can be increased due to a higher degree of automation during and improved possibilities for analysis after the study. Additionally, the Internet provides the possibility to invite a worldwide expert panel to participate in the study. Second, the degree of interaction among the experts can be increased due to the fact that they can immediately react on others‚Äô comments. Additionally, the time frame between giving own answers and getting insights into others‚Äô responses is very short, which encourages stronger cognitive examination with the respective issue in question. Hartman and Baldwin argue that with the help of this procedure the validity of results is maximised. In order to conduct a Real-Time Delphi study, computer software ‚Äì usually web-based ‚Äì is needed for facilitating real-time calculations and visualisation of results. It is generally proposed in the existing literature that the experts participating in the study see not only their own answers but also the median and interquartile range of all given responses immediately after answering a quantitative question. Besides the quantitative assessment a qualitative judgment of participants can be shown which serves as a justification for their numerical assessment of the question. Additionally, it can be shown to the expert how many respondents have already given their answers. To examine the qualitative arguments of others participants can click on a button, and a ‚Äúreasons window‚Äù opens, which shows the statements of other participants to underline their point of view. So, the respective legitimisations given by others may cause a respondent to recapture his own point of view. In the next step the expert can change his own answer, add new arguments to underline his point of view, or leave his answer unchanged. In addition, the respondent will be shown an attention indicator, a so-called ‚Äúflag‚Äù, if his answer is within or outside the interquartile range or significantly different from the median. This application helps to see and understand immediately the own assessment and to think about reasons for the deviation from group opinions or else a high degree of consent. The respondent's attention will be called by highlighting questions with a high degree of deviation with a different colour and by asking him to give further reasons for his deviation from the group opinion. After operating a question in the described procedure, the participant can continue to the next question or press a ‚Äúsave‚Äù-button in the program, which leads to an immediate update of the median, interquartile range, and given arguments, and then leave the program. A second advantage of the round-less approach is the fact that, in order to take part in the study, participants can login and logout with their personalised account as often as they want during the time frame provided. Their already given answers will be saved and recalled when they login the next time. So, by design of the study, there are no explicit single rounds to answer the questions. Updating and playing back the information to the other participants follow immediately in succession to the process of answering. Here, it becomes clear that the process of answering can be synchronous or asynchronous and a worldwide expert panel can be reached, which is one of the major advantages of web-based tools. Turoff and Hiltz argue that the issue of asynchronous interaction is probably one of the least understood characteristics of Real-Time Delphis. Zipfinger Zipfinger, S. (2007). Computer-Aided Delphi: An Experimental Study of Comparing Round-Based with Real-Time Implementation of the Method. Linz: Trauner Verlag. points out two advantages of asynchronous participation of the experts: First, they can login to the portal whenever they want; therefore, one could argue that the degree of convenience of taking part is increased for the participant due to a 24h-availability of the portal. Second, panellists can contribute to whatever aspects in the questionnaire they want, especially when having gone through each question at least once. Here, a substantial aspect of Real-Time Delphis becomes obvious: Turoff and Hiltz explain that a Real-Time Delphi study offers a design of structured communication which allows every individual to choose the sequence and speed to contribute to the problem solution process. So, in comparison to face-to-face discussions, the Real-Time Delphi approach gives room for individuality and different cognitive abilities of the participants. A further advantage is the fact that the administrator of the study can set an arbitrary time frame in which participants have to log in and take part in the questionnaire. So, whenever the researcher or administrator of the study is satisfied with the existing answers (i.e. in terms of quantity and quality), he can declare the study to be ended and close the online tool (i.e. ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù the responses). The key features of Delphi studies, such as anonymity, controlled feedback and group response, are also met in the context of Real-Time Delphi studies. However, the issue of iteration is, by design of the technique, not valid for Real-Time Delphi studies anymore. Instead of answering each question a first time and getting a second sheet with the group responses in the second round, the Real-Time Delphi already shows the second screen (i.e. group responses) immediately after answering each question. Having answered each question at least once, the participant can usually control which question to reassess from a ‚Äúconsensus portal‚Äù, which serves as a kind of control panel to access single questions again. So, on the one hand, the procedure differs from a Conventional Delphi and, on the other hand, the iteration into single rounds is missing. Having asked the question how the accomplishment of a Real-Time Delphi study differs from conducting a usual Delphi study, Gordon and Pease point out that a Real-Time Delphi study can be implemented via a site on the Internet or in any other network (e.g. intra- company network, local area network) and is, therefore, not conducted in paper-and-pencil form any more. As with all Delphi studies, the process of defining and selecting experts is still extremely important. The Conventional Delphi study is then divided into several steps of response round, analysis through the facilitator, playing back the information, next response round, and so on. However, the Real-Time Delphi study is, after granting access to the online tool, rather a self-running process. The basic strengths of a Real- Time Delphi study are its efficiency and applicability to all Delphi topics (i.e. common problem sets, decision making issues, cross impact studies, etc.). Figure 2 illustrates that the process of a Real-Time Delphi differs. Important is to point out that the number of interventions of the facilitator needed during the response phases (i.e. after opening the online tool) are usually less. Having developed the online tool in advance, the intermediate analysis done by the facilitator of the study is rather uncomplicated in comparison to the Conventional Delphi. The overall shortened time period needed to conduct a real-time study underlines that the approach can be regarded as generally more efficient. Gordon and Pease point out that a Real- Time Delphi study is applicable for a wide range of possible circumstances under which the consultation of experts is necessary. On the one hand, the authors give the example of a ‚Äúsmall group operating synchronously in a conference room with laptop computers connected wirelessly to the web site where the software resides, with anticipated completion of the exercise in say 20 min.‚Äù. On the other hand, it can be thought of a larger panel of experts operating asynchronously from remote locations within a longer period of time. The greatest weakness of the real-time approach is that it is missing a wholly integrated, scientifically founded concept. The real-time Delphi idea is still a very new concept, which requires further research and application to become a tool for full-scale operations. Especially the editing of the alpha (i.e. the first) inputs of respondents, the real-time presentation of group results, and the tracking of progress over time should be integrated in a kind of administrator package to make the accomplishment of a Real-Time Delphi less difficult. Examples of real-time Delphi applications Numerous examples for real-time Delphi applications can be found. Among them, The Millennium Project conducted by Glenn, Gordon, & Florescu in 2009 provides a context for global thinking and improved understanding of global issues, opportunities, challenges, and strategies. More information on the project can be found on www.millennium-project.org Another stream of projects based on real-time Delphi studies was conducted by the former Institute for Futures Studies and Knowledge Management of EBS University of Business and Law in Germany, among them the T&L2030; Series of five different studies together with PricewaterhouseCoopers: Transportation & Logistics 2030 Series.

She was built by Brodogradiliste Jozo Lozovina Mosor, Togir, Yugoslavia in 1974 (Yard No. 163) for Stena Ab, G√∂teborg as a roll-on roll-off car and commercial vehicle ferry, under the name Stena Nordica. It was launched on 17 June 1973. From 1996 to 2000, she was owned by SeaFrance under the name SeaFrance Monet. Service history = Stena = Stena Nordica, a steel twin screw motor vessel, was built by Brodogradiliste Jozo Lozovina Mosor in Togir, Yugoslavia, in 1974 (Yard No. 163) for Stena Ab, G√∂teborg as a roll-on roll-off car and commercial vehicle ferry, which was launched 17 June 1973. On 2 June 1974, the Stena Nordica was renamed Stena Danica, which was then renamed back to Stena Nordica in December 1981. On 2 May 1983, the Stena Nordica arrived at a builders' yard in Antwerp for conversion to a new role. Among things done was the moving of loading doors from port side to starboard side. On 10 June 1983, the ship was taken over by Nautica (Belgien) N.V. Ostend, Belgium, and by 16 June commenced service between Ostend and Dover. In August 1983, the ferry suffered complete engine failure and had to be withdrawn for repairs, which lasted over a week. In March 1984, the ferry underwent another renaming, to the Stena Nautica. =SNCF= In late spring 1986, SNCF formed a subsidiary company, Dieppe Ferries, to manage the future of its Newhaven service. The Stena Nautica was now chartered to SNCF in Dieppe, France, and was renamed to Versailles. It was simultaneously transferred to the French flag and commenced service between Newhaven and Dieppe. On 22 January 1990, SNCF Versailles became registered to Societ√© Propietaire des Navaires (SPN), Paris, France, at the same time as SNCF sold 49% of the ferry operations to Stena Sealink Line UK, London, England. Sealink Dieppe Ferries was known as Sealink SNAT and operated in a new livery. Following months of industrial unrest, Sealink SNAT announced that the Newhaven to Dieppe route was to be closed or sold off. Following this announcement, the crew on this route immediately went on strike. By April 1993, it was announced that the Newhaven to Dieppe route had been purchased by Sealink Stena Line, Ashford, England. The ferry was then rebuilt at A,&P.; Appledore, Southampton, England. By 22 May 1992, the ship, now named Stena Londoner, commenced service between Newhaven and Dieppe. The agreement between Stena Sealink Line and its French partners SNAT terminated from 31 December 1995. From that time onwards, SNAT traded as SeaFrance. 3 March 1996 was the final day between Newhaven and Dieppe. =SeaFrance= In June 1996, the Stena Londoner was renamed SeaFrance Monet, registered to G.I.E. Versabil, Calais, France. It underwent a rebuild in Dunkerque and by 3 July 1996 it commenced service between Calais and Dover. After 7 December 1997, during operation between Calais and Dover, the SeaFrance Monet was laid up in Dunkerque. Subsequently, in May 1998, she was laid up in Le Havre. On 29 March 2000, Monet collided with a pier in Calais, during stormy weather, and sustained stabiliser damage. She was sold to Naviera Armas S.A., Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, in a broken down condition on 18 May 2000. On 24 May, Mone was towed from Dunkerque to Vigo, Spain, for engine repairs, arriving on 30 May 2000. =Naviera Armas= On 11 September 2000, the SeaFrance Monet was renamed Volc√°n de Tacande and commenced service with Armas around the Canary Islands. Services included Los Cristianos - San Sebasti√°n de la Gomera - La Estaca. On a voyage from Los Cristianos to San Sebasti√°n de La Gomera, on 30 January 2005, the vessel lost all power due to a flooded engine room. All passengers had to be evacuated. Eventually, the vessel was towed to Puerto de Las Palmas where she was later declared a total loss. In May 2005, she was sold for breaking and in June 2005, she arrived in Turkey for scrapping.

Although it was the original terminus to cross Pennines rail traffic on the Eden Valley Railway, it was rapidly by-passed by a new line and junction. The station, which was on the West Coast Main Line, was treated as a private stop by the Earls of Lonsdale. History A pre-grouping railway junction map showing Clifton and Lowther station on the line between the line from and and the junction with the Eden Valley Railway The station opened as Clifton railway station on Lancaster and Carlisle Railway in 1846. In 1858 work began to build the Eden Valley Railway between Penrith and Kirkby Stephen via Appleby-in-Westmorland. It would primarily be for mineral traffic but it would also carry passengers. The terminus at the western end of the new line would be Clifton Station. Eden Valley passenger services used an island platform that also served the West Coast Main line. The station also had goods sidings, a turntable, and water tower. However, even before the Eden Valley line opened, plans were conceived to build a northern junction that would provide a direct link between the industrial areas of West Cumberland and the northeast's coalfields around Durham and Newcastle. The Eden Valley line would provide a direct connection between the Cockermouth & Workington Railway's Workington to Penrith line and the Stockton and Darlington railway. Although the branch - which had several cuttings, embankments and bridges - was completed to Clifton station, by 1862 permission was given to build the northern connection that would allow trains from Penrith to run directly onto the Eden Valley line. When the new route opened in 1863, a new Clifton station was built on the northern section (it was later renamed Clifton Moor in 1927). Eden Valley trains could now use the northern track as they had been granted running powers on the L&CR; line to Penrith. After 1874, the short southern branch from the Eden Valley Railway to the original Clifton station was closed. Despite losing its cross Pennine passenger services, the station remained open. In 1887 the station was renamed Clifton & Lowther. It closed to passenger services in 1938 and to freight in 1951. Private station Remains of a bridge over the original Eden Valley Railway line to Clifton & Lowther When Clifton first opened Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale, who lived in the nearby Lowther Castle, was permitted to stop any train on demand. When the new Clifton Station (see ) opened in 1863 the railway company built him his own private waiting room. This private agreement was subsequently passed on to future Earls of Lonsdale. A 1903 article in Railway Magazine noted: > We cannot regard Lowther Railway Station, on the London and North-Western > line, as absolutely a private station, but the Earl of Lonsdale, who is the > great territorial feudal lord of the district of Cumberland that stretches > about Penrith and Askham, has a private agreement with the railway > authorities in virtue of which, for certain concessions made with regard to > building the station, the land it stands on, etc., he, his family, and > guests have the right to have any train stopped at any required times at > Lowther Station, whether such trains are expresses or not, and whether they > may be timed to stop near or far from Lowther Station. It will easily be > seen, therefore, that, such a \\"right\\" is tantamount in many ways to owning a > private railway station, with the additional advantage that somebody else > keeps up the maintenance of the place! Yet \\"Clifton and Lowther Station\\" is > open to the public, and so is not absolutely a \\"private\\" station.

Pfeifer joined the Marine Corps from Philadelphia under the name Louis Fred Theis and served aboard the during engagements in the waters around Manila during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. When a fire broke out aboard ship and several crew members went missing while trying to extinguish the flames, Pfeifer (under the name of Theis) and several other shipmates risked their lives to rescue them. All eventually received the Medal of Honor for their actions. After receiving the Medal of Honor he continued to serve in the Marine Corps and upon reenlistment changed his name back to Pfeifer until he was discharged in 1917. Early life and military career Pfeifer was born June 19, 1876, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 5, 1898, he joined the Marine Corps from Brooklyn, New York. He enlisted under the name Louis F. Theis and served his first enlistment under this name. He was assigned to the marine contingent aboard the when it was sent as part of Admiral George Dewey's fleet in the campaign against Manila during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the Battle of Manila Bay. =Medal of Honor action= On the morning of March 31, 1901, while off Cavite in Manila Bay, a fire started aboard the Petrel originating in the sail room. The sail room was a small compartment in the bottom of the ship, adjacent to the magazine and was accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. Several members of the ship's crew, led by the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes filled the area. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no other lamps would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him, including Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below). When the four men did not return, Seaman Alphonse Girandy tied a rope around his waist and climbed down the ladder, finding Kessler and Flaherty, both semi-conscious, and passing them up to be hauled through the hatchway. He found Toner at the bottom of the ladder and, although losing consciousness himself, held on to him as the sailors above pulled both men out of the compartment. Lieutenant J.S. McKean, with a rope around his waist, was next into the sail room, followed by Private Louis F. Thies (Pfiefer) and Seaman Thomas Cahey. As McKean searched in the darkness for the two men still missing, Lieutenant Commander Roper and Cadet Lewis, the ship's generator finally came back online. With the help of a lamp lowered through the hatchway, McKean could see Roper and Lewis slumped against the walls of the compartment. McKean dragged Roper to the ladder to be hauled out and then, with the help of Theis and Cahey, rescued Lewis, just before losing consciousness himself. The fire was extinguished later that day; Roper was killed by the fumes, but the other men all eventually recovered. For their actions during the incident, Cahey, Girandy, and Thies were each awarded the Medal of Honor. Pfeifer received his medal on March 22, 1902, while still going by the name of Louis Fred Theis. His complete citation states: > Serving on board the U.S.S. Petrel; for heroism and gallantry, fearlessly > exposing his own life to danger for the saving of the others on the occasion > of the fire on board that vessel, 31 March 1901.

The eviction of this invading force of tribal raiders, who enjoyed numerical superiority, better lines of communication, commanding high ground and superior logistics, was a major military achievement for the small force of Indian soldiers. Relief of Leh Pakistani raiders had besieged and reduced Skardu in early 1948.. It was vital that Leh, the next likely target, be relieved before it was attacked by the raiders. Maj Prithi Chand, a Lahauli officer with a band of 40 volunteers from the 2nd Battalion, Dogra Regiment began a hazardous mid-winter ascent of Zojila pass on 16 February 1948, with rifles and ammunition for the garrison. They reached Leh on 8 March, where an ad hoc force for defence was organised, followed soon by a Jammu and Kashmir State Forces detachment bringing additional weapons. Reinforcement of Leh The slow advance of raiders permitted reinforcement of Leh by air by a company of 2nd Battalion, 4 Gorkha Rifles (2/4 GR) and later a company of 2nd Battalion, 8th Gorkha Rifles (2/8 GR) by air just in time to repulse the raiders. Had the raiders kept advancing they could have captured Leh easily. The garrison of Leh held despite shortage of troops, weapons and ammunition, sickness and fatigue. In August another company of 2/8 GR was flown in by air and the remaining part of the battalion, codenamed Arjun column, with a large column of supplies on mules, trekked to Leh from Manali. Another large mule column, codenamed Chapati column, followed in September to provide adequate supplies for the winter. Lt Col (later Col) HS Parab, CO 2/8 GR, was airlifted to Leh on 23 Aug and later designated Commander, Leh Brigade (though the force never exceeded two battalions in strength). Spirited small unit actions and guerilla raids on both banks of the Indus effectively held the raiders at bay throughout September and October. Capture of Zoji La Operation Duck 15 August 1948 ‚Äì 1 November 1948 When Zoji La fell to the enemy in May 1948, it was vital for the Indians that the pass be recaptured before winter so as to relieve Leh. An unsuccessful frontal attack was launched by 77 Parachute Brigade under Brig Hiralal Atal to capture Zoji La pass. Operation Duck, the earlier epithet for this assault, was renamed as Operation Bison by Lt Gen Cariappa, the Western Army commander. M5 Stuart light tanks of 7 Cavalry were moved in dismantled conditions through Srinagar to Baltal while the superhuman efforts of two field companies of the Madras Sappers working day and night improved the mule track from Baltal up the Zoji La to Gumri. The surprise attack on 1 November by the brigade with armour, led by the division commander Thimayya in the lead tank, and supported by two regiments of 25 pounders and a regiment of 3.7 inch guns, saw the enemy being surprised. The pass was forced and the enemy pushed back to Matayan. Liberation of Leh and Kargil Since the raiders were inactive on the Leh front during 77 Para Brigade‚Äôs operations in Zoji La, Leh Brigade went onto the offensive advancing from Tharu to Marol on the north bank of the Indus and from Chilling to Lamayuru to Kargil on the south bank. Another detachment advanced along the Shyok River clearing opposition on that axis and securing the Nubra Valley flank. On the Zoji La front, 77 Parachute Brigade launched a deliberate attack and captured Matayan on 13 November and Dras on 15 November. The brigade linked up on 24 November at Kargil with Indian troops advancing from Leh while the enemy withdrew northwards toward Skardu. The Indian pursuit was halted by fierce enemy action at Chathatang as the enemy soldiers blew themselves under Indian tanks to save their posts, 5 km ahead of the Marol fork of the Indus. The strong enemy defenses, on both banks of the Indus, resisted till 1 January 1949 when a ceasefire was called.

It is based on OpenSolaris, which was based on System V Release 4 (SVR4) and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). illumos comprises a kernel, device drivers, system libraries, and utility software for system administration. This core is now the base for many different open-sourced illumos distributions, in a similar way in which the Linux kernel is used in different Linux distributions.What illumos is and is not  ZDNet The maintainers write illumos in lowercase since some computer fonts do not clearly distinguish a lowercase L from an uppercase i (see homoglyph).  Overview  The OpenIndiana operating system is based on illumos illumos was announced via webinar on Thursday, 3 August 2010, as a community effort of some core Solaris engineers to create a truly open source Solaris by swapping closed source bits of OpenSolaris with open implementations. The original plan explicitly stated that illumos would not be a distribution or a fork. However, after Oracle announced discontinuing OpenSolaris, plans were made to fork the final version of the Solaris ON kernel allowing illumos to evolve into a kernel of its own. , efforts focused on libc, the NFS lock manager, the crypto module and many device drivers to create a Solaris-like OS with no closed, proprietary code. , development emphasis includes transitioning from the historical compiler, Studio, to GCC.https://www.openindiana.org/documentation/faq/#how-does- openindiana-differ-from-opensolaris \\"Oracle‚Äôs Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler.\\" The \\"userland\\" software is now built with GNU make and contains many GNU utilities such as GNU tar. illumos is lightly led by founder Garrett D'Amore and other community members/developers such as Bryan Cantrill and Adam Leventhal, via a Developers' Council. The illumos Foundation has been incorporated in the State of California as a 501(c)6 trade association, with founding board members Jason Hoffman (formerly at Joyent), Evan Powell (Nexenta), and Garrett D'Amore. As of August 2012 the foundation was in the process of formalizing its by-laws and organizational development. At OpenStorage Summit 2010, the new logo for illumos was revealed, with official type and branding to follow over.  Development  Its primary development project, illumos-gate, derives from OS/Net (aka ON) , which is a Solaris kernel with the bulk of the drivers, core libraries, and basic utilities, similar to what is delivered by a BSD \\"src\\" tree. It was originally dependent on OpenSolaris OS/Net, but a fork was made after Oracle silently decided to close the development of Solaris and unofficially killed the OpenSolaris project.

The series aired on syndication during its original run from September 13, 2010, to May 24, 2012. The Nate Berkus Show is a spin-off of The Oprah Winfrey Show. In September 2012, the Oprah Winfrey Network purchased the cable rights to The Nate Berkus Show, along with the first five seasons of Rachael Ray. Production The show was co-produced by Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures Television. It is taped in 1080i (HDTV) at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York. The series was distributed by Sony Pictures Television, after Sony and NBCUniversal made agreements to launch the show on all 10 NBC owned and operated stations, as well as Harpo Productions. The show's premiere came in response to the cancellation of The Bonnie Hunt Show, which was not renewed for the 2010‚Äì11 television season. As a result, most NBC stations were having trouble finding daytime programming. Broadcasting & Cable reported that NBC syndicated daytime programming, aside from The Ellen DeGeneres Show, \\"have been largely out of the daytime game, primarily because of low to lukewarm ratings for Bonnie Hunt's show. On December 9, 2011, it was announced that the show, which NBC had given a two-year commitment to air, would end after its second season. It remained in production and delivered all scheduled original episodes. The show officially ended on May 24, 2012, with reruns airing through August 31, 2012. Ratings When the show debuted, The Nate Berkus Show had a 1.1 rating, which was the highest rating for a new daytime talk show during the 2010‚Äì11 television season. although the rating showed only half of what the ratings for Dr. Oz was. The ratings stayed stagnant for the entire two-year run, never averaging more than a 1.1, and the Hollywood Reporter stated that Berkus's program ranked #126 in all of syndication at the time of its cancellation.

The lineup consisted of Joseph Nolan (Guitar,vocals), Yossi Hatton (Bass,vocals), and Chris Swirski (Drums,vocals). Their version of progressive rock is strongly influenced by bands of the 1970s and 1980s including The Stooges, The Mothers of Invention, Talking Heads and Minutemen. As Patrick Ferrucci quotes, \\"It‚Äôs party rock with an edge and an intelligence. There‚Äôs wit and wildness just swimming around in Kimono‚Äôs music\\".Ferrucci, Patrick: Not Draggin' Their Feet Anymore, New Haven Register, 2009. Mark Suppanz of The Big Takeover describes the music as \\"...noisy, souped-up rock saturated with a healthy dose of reckless abandon and a raw, unpolished and in-your-face sound\\".Suppanz, Mark: Review - Space Orphans and We are the Dudes, pg. 175, Issue66, The Big Takeover, 2010. History Kimono Draggin' formed out of the ashes of several New Haven based indie bands. Upon recording their 5-song demo, titled \\"The Essence of Dik Chin\\", they began writing a rock opera that instead evolved into a script for a chopsocky mockumentary television series. The script saw the 3 musicians as moonlighting students of a martial art called Dik Chin. The story combined the band's jangly art rock with a healthy dose of humor and b-movie action. A&E; Network Production Assistant, Aurelio Muraca (Nanny 911, Trading Spouses) had seen the band play in Danbury, CT and had heard the band was writing a show. After several meetings it was decided the show wouldn't come to fruition due to lack of writing interest on the band's behalf. More focused on their love of music, Kimono Draggin' pushed forward performing their own brand of Progressive rock to eccentric audiences across New England. In early 2005, the trio recorded their first LP, \\"My Summer in Paris\\" with producer/engineer Scott Amore (of The Butterflies of Love). They supported their self-released album by touring extensively, playing historic rock venues such as the Knitting Factory and CBGB. The album received a lengthy, obscure review on Allmusic by Eugene Chadbourne and was criticized by many for its explicit lyrical content. As stated by Chadbourne in the review, \\"Little bits of his [Nolan's] lyrics crest to the top of the jam on golden surfboards, glowing with the essence of sheer stupidity that rock & roll thrives on.\\"Chadbourne, Eugene: Review - My Summer in Paris, All Music, 2005. Kimono Draggin' went back in the studio in 2007 with Scott Amore and recorded what would later become \\"Space Orphans\\", but the band became sidetracked and embarked on a European Tour. The tour was created around an invitation to perform at Zappanale 18 in Bad Doberan Germany (a music festival memorializing the late Frank Zappa). Kimono Draggin' successfully performed a mostly original set to the sea of Frank Zappa fans that stood before them. The band supported additional acts on the festival, including Frank Zappa veterans Chad Wackerman, Don Preston and Napoleon Murphy Brock. This performance gained the attention of Peter Van Laarhoven of the Belgian music magazine, United Mutations. Van Laarhoven states, \\"...the band has evolved quite a lot the last couple of years. The power and the Beefheart approach are still there, but it's all more balanced.\\"Van Laarhoven, Peter: Blog Article, United Mutations, 2009. During this time period the band performed live on BBC Radio Humberside with Alan Raw at their Queen's Gardens, Hull studios. The tour also saw Kimono perform memorable gigs at The Star and Garter in Manchester, England and Tapas la Movida in Nice, France. The trio took a brief hiatus in 2008, rarely performing live. In the summer they began writing diligently and then began performing heavily around New England supporting Philo Cramer (formerly of Fear) and Richard Lloyd (formerly of Television). In the summer of 2009, Kimono Draggin' was discovered by 2 former recording students of Murray Krugman (producer of Blue √ñyster Cult). Matt Labozza and Kurt Daniello invited the band into the studios at University of New Haven where they recorded their second full-length album titled \\"We Are The Dudes\\". During this time, the band decided to finally finish and release \\"Space Orphans\\" as well. In support of this double-album release, Kimono Draggin' threw a CD Release party in December 2009 performing with guests, Fighting Cocks (featuring Philo Cramer from Fear) and Continental (featuring Rick Barton formerly of Dropkick Murphys). Upon the successful release of both albums, the band filmed a music video for the song 'Ello Dudes which features the bandmates as violent troublemakers who kidnap and torture two random people. The video was inspired by the work of Stanley Kubrick. Shortly after the video's premier, the band was approached by Verbicide Magazine for a feature interview. In 2011, the band recorded their 4th full-length album,'Kimono Gold' in January and officially split up in March. Chris Swirski and Joe Nolan have continued to play music together in other projects, including Space Orphans and Joe Division.
