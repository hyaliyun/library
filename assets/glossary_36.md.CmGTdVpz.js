Autoclave tape works by changing color after exposure to temperatures commonly used in sterilization processes, typically 121¬∞C in a steam autoclave. Small strips of the tape are applied to the items before they are placed into the autoclave. The tape is similar to masking tape but slightly more adhesive, to allow it to adhere under the hot, moist conditions of the autoclave. One such tape has diagonal markings containing an ink which changes colour (usually beige to black) upon heating. It is important to note that the presence of autoclave tape that has changed color on an item does not ensure that the product is sterile, as the tape will change color upon exposure only. For steam sterilization to occur, the entire item must completely reach and maintain 121¬∞C for 15‚Äì20 minutes with proper steam exposure to ensure sterilization. The color-changing indicator of tape is usually lead carbonate based, which decomposes to lead(II) oxide. To protect users from lead -- and because this decomposition can occur at many moderate temperatures -- manufactures may protect the lead carbonate layer with a resin or polymer that is degraded under steam at high temperature.

It was on the Washington ballot in November 1998 and passed with 58.22% of the vote. It added to Washington's law (but not its constitution) the following language: Initiative 200 effectively curtailed any form of affirmative action in the state.https://www.kirklandreporter.com/news/i-1000-passes-state-legislature- as-advocates-hope-to-increase-equality/ In April 2019, the Washington Legislature passed Initiative 1000, ending the ban on affirmative action.https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington- lawmakers-pass-initiative-1000-ending-a-2-decade-ban-on-affirmative-action/ However, in November 2019, Referendum 88 blocked Initiative 1000 from going into effect.https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/with-nearly- all-ballots-counted-voters-reject-washingtons-affirmative-action-measure/  Background  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the civil rights movement came to an end, states nationwide developed policies as a form of remedy aimed to help mitigate the impact of institutionalized racism, sexism, etc. The policies were created to give special consideration to underrepresented minorities when state contracts and hiring where involved.https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1994/1994_93_1841 In doing so the state believed that the availability of opportunities would help in the advancement of underrepresented minorities. Chapter 49.60 RCW, which prohibited discrimination against any person on basis of race, color, creed, national origin, family and marital statute, sex, age, or disability, was the standing Washington law prior to the enactment of Initiative 200, and had been upheld previously by courts and the Human Rights Commission. Included in the statute was a provision requiring state agencies access to affirmative action strategies to increase opportunities amongst racial minorities, including women, and veterans. State funded schools and universities were granted authority to establish their own entrance and admissions program with entrance requirements. The requirements outlined in the admission program must have complied with all federal laws prohibiting discrimination. Some universities had admissions policies in which the objective was to select students who had demonstrated capacity, high quality work, and who would contribute to a diverse student body.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2002/2002_02_241/  Initiative  Initiative 200, a Washington State statute enacted by direct public vote took place in November 1998. The voting took place statewide, with approximately 1.9 million voters taking to the polls. 58.2 percent, or a grand total of 1,099,410 voters supported the measure. Statewide, all counties passed the statute, with only one exception, King County, in all places but Seattle.http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/publications/detail/toward-an-equal- society-making-initiative-200-work Following the initiative's passage, Washington Governor Gary Locke, who had opposed the initiative, issued a directive to guide state agencies in its implementation.https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/GovernorLocke/eo/dir98-01.htm The governor's directive was criticized as \\"timid\\" by the free-market think tank Washington Policy Center.https://www.washingtonpolicy.org/publications/detail/toward-an-equal- society-making-initiative-200-work  Opposition and outcomes  Proponents of I-200 said it was a step toward a \\"colorblind\\" society, a promise of the equality of merit and the limited role of government to make that so. However, opponents have noted that colorblind ideologies individualize conflicts and shortcomings, rather than examining the larger picture with cultural differences, stereotypes, and values placed into context. Among the outspoken opponents of the measure included former Governor Gary Locke.http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981011&slug;=2777038 The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Editorial Board also noted: Opponents continue to point to the negative impact of I-200 on higher education, particularly in the face of the State's substantial growth of minority groups and the demand for an educated workforce. A draft report by the Higher Education Coordinating Board shows that Washington State African Americans, Hispanic and American Indian students \\"were not participating -- nor were they achieving academically -- at rates comparable to statewide averages.\\" While I-200 was enacted, more than half of all American Indians who graduated from high school were college bound. In 2003, those numbers dropped to 38 percent.http://www.wsac.wa.gov/sites/default/files/DiversityReport_001.pdf In addition, opponents have criticized Tim Eyman, the Initiative's sponsor, for diverting campaign funds meant for several ballot initiatives he sponsored for personal use. In 2000 and 2001, it was discovered that Eyman diverted as much as $200,000 in campaign funds for several of his initiatives.http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Eyman-stripped-of- control-1080158.php References Category:History of affirmative action in the United States Category:Government of Washington (state) Category:Opposition to affirmative action ","title":"Initiative 200"},{"id":"9847577","text":"Sutherlandia, known as Ballonerbsen in German, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae containing 6 known living species.

Through solar radiation, thunderstorms, and the fair-weather condition, the atmosphere is subject to a continual and substantial electrical current. Principally, thunderstorms throughout the world carry negative charges to the earth, which is then discharged gradually through the air in fair weather. This atmospheric circuit is central to the study of atmospheric physics and meteorology. It is used in the prediction of thunderstorms, and was central to the understanding of electricity. In the past it has been suggested as a source of available energy, or communications platform. The global electrical circuit is also applied to the study of human health and air pollution, due to the interaction of negative ions and aerosols. The effect of global warming, and temperature- sensitivity of the Earth's electrical circuit is unknown.  History  Wardenclyffe Power Plant attempted to use the earth's electrical circuit for telecommunications In the 18th century, scientists began understanding the link between lightning and electricity. In addition to the iconic kite experiments of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas-Fran√ßois Dalibard, some early studies of electric charges in a \\"cloudless atmosphere\\" were done by John Canton, Giambatista Beccaria, and John Read. In 1752, Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier observed electrification in fair weather. Various others performed measurements throughout the late 18th century, often finding consistent diurnal variations. During the 19th century, several long series of observations were made. Measurements near cities were heavily influenced by smoke pollution. In the early 20th century, balloon ascents provided information about the electric field in the upper atmosphere. Important work was done by the research vessel Carnegie, which produced standardised measurements around the world's oceans (where the air is relatively clean). C. T. R. Wilson was the first to present a theory of a global circuit in 1920. Mechanism = Lightning = Lightning strikes the earth 40,000 times per day,Electricity in the Atmosphere ‚Äì Feynman Lectures and can be thought to charge the earth like a battery. Thunderstorms generate an electrical potential difference between the earth's surface and the ionosphere, mainly by means of lightning. Because of this, the ionosphere is positively charged relative to the earth. Consequently, there is always a small current transporting charged particles between the ionosphere and the surface. = Fair weather condition= This current is carried by a small number of ions present in the atmosphere (generated mainly by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere, and by radioactivity near the surface). Different locations, and meteorological conditions on the earth can have different electrical conductivity. Fair weather condition describes the state of atmospheric electricity where air carries this electrical current between the earth and the ionosphere.  Measurement  The voltages involved in the Earth's circuit are significant. At sea level, the typical potential gradient in fair weather is 120 V/m. Nonetheless, since the conductivity of air is limited, the associated currents are also limited. A typical value is 1800 A over the entire planet. When it is not rainy or stormy, the amount of electricity within the atmosphere is typically between 1000 and 1800 amps. In fair weather conditions, there are about 3.5 microamps per square kilometer (9 microamps per square mile). This can produce a 200+ volt difference between the head and feet of a regular person. Local turbulence, winds, and other fluctuations also cause small variations in the fair weather electric field, causing the fair- weather condition to be partially regional. = Carnegie curve = The Earth's electrical current varies according to a daily pattern called the Carnegie curve, believed to be caused by the regular daily variations in atmospheric electrification associated with the earth's weather regions. The pattern also shows seasonal variation, linked to the earth's solstices and equinoxes. It was named after the Carnegie Institution for Science.

The bridge is a seven-arch stone railroad bridge located on the Norfolk Southern Railway mainline, built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1887-88. Its upstream face was reinforced with concrete in 1929. This bridge survived the Johnstown Flood of 1889, but the bridge blocked debris across the river. These materials, including barbed wire, subsequently caught fire and created an inferno covering . Scores of people were trapped and killed. The bridge is visible from Point Park in downtown Johnstown.  Stone Bridge project  The Stone Bridge, located on the edge of Johnstown's downtown, is an arched bridge built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1887. On May 31, 1889, its seven arches blocked tons of debris, carried by the Johnstown Flood, including miles of barbed wire twisted through it from the destruction of a plant. The bridge withstood the force of the flood and this load. But an enormous fire broke out in the debris at the bridge, killing scores of people trapped within it, and burning for three days. A Johnstown landmark, the three-track bridge is still used by the railroad. It is now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway. Route 56, the most heavily traveled road in the region, passes nearby. The bridge is highly visible from Route 56, downtown, the Johnstown Area Heritage Association's (JAHA) newly established Festival Park, and the restaurant and visitors center above the city at the Inclined Plane. The bridge needed restoration, as its stone fa√ßade had long since been covered with concrete, added when the bridge was expanded with a third track, and its general appearance was poor. A bridge restoration project was developed by community leaders, to include cleaning and physical and aesthetic improvements, resurfacing of the south side, and new lighting with energy-efficient LED lighting adjustable to different colors and intensities. Estimated to cost $1.2 million, the project was initiated in 2008 as part of flood commemorative activities. Michael Brosig, co-chair of the Stone Bridge Committee, said, > The significance of the Stone Bridge is that it stood its ground against the > flood waters and altered the future of Johnstown completely and forever. It > created the backdrop for the event that put Johnstown on the map. Restoring > the South facade of that structure and casting LED lighting on it will > certainly showcase the triumph of the human spirit in a spectacular style > for all to see, enjoy and be proud of their heritage. Based on its strategic > location, it is the linchpin of the historic district of our city. Consultants on the bridge restoration project included Shadowstone, Inc., of Clifton, New Jersey, for the lighting. For the bridge restoration and rehabilitation, the group worked with Pawlowski & Haman Architects, P.C., and H. F. Lenz Co., both of Johnstown.

The 5th BG was a prewar bomb group assigned to Hawaii at the time of the Pearl Harbor Attack; its B-17s largely destroyed on the ground at Hickam Field. The unit was reformed into a B-24 Liberator heavy bomb group after the attack and was assigned to Thirteenth AF during the war; the 32d Composite Wing flew RB-29s for Far East Air Forces in the late 1940s, primarily as photo-mapping aircraft over China, Formosa, Indochina and Korea. Strategic Air Command (Groups) Army Air Forces B-29 bomb groups assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) after the command's establishment in March 1946. Includes groups that were returned to the United States from the European Theater and were programmed to redeploy to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) after their B-29 conversion training was completed. These units were retained on active service after the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945 and were assigned to Continental Air Forces (CAF). In March 1946 were transferred to SAC upon redesignation of CAF to SAC. Many of these units and squadrons were under-manned and under-equipped due to the rapid demobilization of the armed forces in this period. In addition, frequent inactivations and activations were made, with older, prewar units being reactivated in place of younger, wartime units. Up until the end of the Korean War, SAC used tail markings that consisted of a combination of geometric shapes and letters. The shape would indicate the Numbered Air Force, with a triangle representing the Eighth Air Force; a circle for Fifteenth Air Force and a square for Second Air Force. This system was phased out in 1953. * 2d Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1947‚Äì1948) : Activated in July 1947 : Chatam AFB, Georgia : Tail Code: Empty Square : 20th Bombardment Squadron : 49th Bombardment Squadron : 96th Bombardment Squadron : Re-equipped with B-50 Superfortress, July 1948 * 7th Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1946‚Äì1948) : Activated in October 1946 : Carswell AFB, Texas : Tail Code: Empty Triangle : 9th Bombardment Squadron : 436th Bombardment Squadron : 492d Bombardment Squadron : Re-equipped with B-36 Peacemaker, July 1948 * 22d Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1948‚Äì1952) : Reassigned from Fifth Air Force (WPA) : Redesignated Very Heavy BG, June 1946 : March AFB, California : Tail Code: Circle-E : 2d Bombardment Squadron : 19th Bombardment Squadron : 33d Bombardment Squadron : Group assigned to 22d Bombardment Wing, June 1952 * 28th Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1946‚Äì1950) : Activated in July 1946 from a/p/e of inactivated 449th Bombardment Group : Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota : Tail Code: Triangle-S : 77th Bombardment Squadron : 717th Bombardment Squadron : 718th Bombardment Squadron : Re-equipped with RB-29 Superfortress, April 1950 : Re-equipped with B-36 Peacemaker, July 1950 * 43d Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1946‚Äì1948) : Activated in October 1946 from a/p/e of inactivated 444th Bombardment Group : Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona : Tail Code: Circle-K : 63d Bombardment Squadron : 64th Bombardment Squadron : 65th Bombardment Squadron : Re-equipped with B-50 Superfortress, July 1948 * 92d Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1946‚Äì1952) : Reassigned from Eighth Air Force (ETO) : Redesignated Very Heavy BG, July 1946 : Fairchild AFB, Washington : Tail Code: Circle-W : 325th Bombardment Squadron : 326th Bombardment Squadron : 327th Bombardment Squadron : Group assigned to 92d Bombardment Wing, June 1952 * 93d Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1947‚Äì1949) : Reassigned from Eighth Air Force (ETO) : Redesignated Very Heavy BG, July 1945 : Castle AFB, California : Tail Code: Circle-M : 328th Bombardment Squadron : 329th Bombardment Squadron : 330th Bombardment Squadron : Re-equipped with B-50 Superfortress, July 1949 * 97th Bombardment Group, (B-29, 1946‚Äì1950) : Activated in August 1946 from a/p/e of inactivated 485th Bombardment Group : Eielson AFB, Alaska;

B-29 \\"Very Heavy\\" bomber units were redesignated \\"Medium\\" with the introduction of the B-36 Peacemaker into the inventory in 1948, with some units transitioning to the B-36/RB-36 beginning in 1949. The B-50 Superfortress, an advanced version of the B-29 was also introduced in 1949. SAC deployed non nuclear-capable B-29 groups to Far East Air Forces in 1950 to conduct strategic bombardment missions over the skies of North Korea, however the aircraft was made obsolete by the development of Soviet jet-powered interceptors such as the MiG-15. The B-29 soldiered on for a more few years in the strategic bombardment role, but by 1955 was replaced by the B-47 Stratojet medium bomber. In 1950, conversions of B-29s to KB-29P aerial tankers began to reach SAC squadrons. KB-29s were in service with SAC until being replaced by the KC-97 Stratofreighter (which was itself based on the B-29) by 1955. * 1st Fighter Wing, (B-29, 1949) : March AFB, California : Assigned to Headquarters 1st FW while attached to 22d Bombardment Wing * 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (B-29, 1949;

Weather reconnaissance duties required special variant of the B-29. Armament and related equipment was removed and in place of upper forward turret astrodome was installed. Additional radio and specialized meteorological equipment was installed and such refitted aircraft was redesignated WB-29.Lloyd, B-29 Superfortress. Part 2 While the B-29's \\"public\\" mission was that of weather reconnaissance, the \\"covert\\" mission, that of atmospheric sampling for radiation debris, was perhaps the more critical task. WB-29s soldiered on through the mid-1950s, providing critical data on tropical storms, nuclear tests, and many other routine but important reconnaissance tasks. But the airplanes were weary, and by 1956 were replaced by a modification of seventy-eight B-50Ds to WB-50 configuration. * 53d Reconnaissance Squadron (Very Long Range, Weather) : Kindley AFB, Bermuda (B-29, 1946‚Äì1947.

On October 14, 1947, Capt Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Yeager was dropped in his X-1 from the B-29 and was credited as the first human to pilot an aircraft faster than the speed of sound. Several B-29s were modified for various experimental purposes under the designation EB-29. Perhaps the best known of these was the EB-29 used as the carrier aircraft for the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin parasite fighter in 1948. The rear bomb bay was modified to carry a special cradle from which the XF-85 could be launched and retrieved in flight. Other B-29s flown at Eglin/Muroc/Edwards AFB were XB-29E fire control test model; XG-29G (44-84043) which served as a flying test bed for J-35, J-47 and J-73 jet engines mounted in the bomb bay; the YB-29H used for special armament testing; YB-29J used for services testing of improved engine designs; QB-29 target drones. The CB-29K was an experimental transport version. Air Defense Command Beginning in 1954, the 4754th Radar Evaluation Squadron, Air Defense Command operated B-29s from various bases in the United States to provide ECM training and evaluation services to its radar site personnel.

The Skyrocket exceeded Mach 2 for the first time on November 20, 1953 (piloted by Scott Crossfield). The last Skyrocket flight took place in December 1956. P2B-1S BuNo 84029 was later transferred to NACA for continuation of high-speed flight tests and was redesignated as NACA-137. It was eventually sold to a civilian owner, a museum in Oakland, California. This was the only example of a flyable B-29 ever being sold to a civilian operator. This B-29 was flown on rare occasions under the civil registration N91329. After many years of inactivity, it was sold to the Kermit Weeks Aviation Museum of Miami, Florida. It was transported there disassembled in 1987. It was registered with the Weeks Museum as N29KW. Allied nations =United Kingdom= During the early 1950s, the Royal Air Force urgently needed interim aircraft for its bomber units, as a \\"stop gap\\" replacement for the Avro Lincoln,until British-designed and manufactured jets like the English Electric Canberra and, in the longer term, the so-called \\"V bombers\\", became operational. From the RAF's point of view the B-29, was a heavy bomber comparable to the Lincoln, albeit with distinct performance and capacity advantages and, as a type that had already been proven operationally, did not detract from the development of the British jets. A formal agreement with the USA was signed on January 27, 1950 and the USAF loaned the RAF seventy B-29 bombers which received the serials WF434-WF448, WF490-WF-514 and WF545-WF574. Later another 18 were delivered under serials WW342-WW356 and WZ966-WZ968.Nowicki, B-29 Superfortress, p.16 The aircraft received the service name Boeing Washington B.1 (B.1 from \\"Bomber Mark 1\\") with RAF Bomber Command from 1950 as a longer-range nuclear-capable bomber, pending the introduction of the English Electric Canberra in quantity. Most of the airframes were taken out of USAF storage and were virtually new, having been delivered at the end of the Pacific War, although a small number came from operational units. The first 4 aircraft were delivered to the Washington Conversion Unit at RAF Marham on March 22, 1950. All B-29s for the RAF were ferried by the crews of the 307th Bombardment Wing USAF. The first unit converted to Washingtons was No. 115 Squadron RAF which flown from USA in June 1950. Two RAF Washingtons took part in the Laurence Minot SAC bombing competition in 1951 alongside USAF B-29s. Squadrons based at RAF Coningsby were converted to English Electric Canberra bombers in 1953. Squadrons from RAF Marham were converted a year later. Most Washingtons were returned to the United States, being flown by RAF crews to Dover AFB; then subsequently to the aircraft storage facility at Davis-Monthan AFB. A small number of Washingtons remained in the United Kingdom, being used by 192 Sq. for Electronic Intelligence operations until 1958; later being used as ground target airframes for RAF combat aircraft. ;Royal Air Force *RAF Marham : No. 35 Squadron RAF : No. 90 Squadron RAF : No. 115 Squadron RAF : No. 207 Squadron RAF *RAF Coningsby : No. 15 Squadron RAF : No. 44 Squadron RAF : No. 57 Squadron RAF (moved from RAF Waddington in April 1952) : No. 149 Squadron RAF *RAF Watton : No. 192 Squadron RAF operated Washingtons between April 1952 and February 1958. =Australia= Two ex-RAF Washingtons (WW354 and WW353) (former USAAF 44-61963; 44-62049) were turned over by the RAF to the Royal Australian Air Force Aeronautical Research and Development Unit in late 1952 and conducted trials for the United Kingdom's Ministry of Supply. They were assigned the RAAF serials A76-1 and A76-2. Both aircraft were retired in 1956 and sold for scrap in 1957.A76 Boeing Washington RAAF Museum.

Early life Hall Bartlett was born in Kansas City, Missouri, he graduated from Yale University Phi Beta Kappa, and was a Rhodes Scholar nominee. He served five years in Naval intelligence, then started his film making career when he began producing the documentary film Navajo, the first contemporary picture to focus attention on the plight of the American Indian. Bartlett was also the first filmmaker to do a picture about professional football: his film Crazylegs was the story of superstar Elroy Hirsch.  Career  = 1950's = Bartlett's next film and directorial debut, Unchained, was filmed inside the California Institution for Men at Chino, California. Bartlett spent six months living as an inmate while he wrote the screenplay. The film's musical theme, \\"Unchained Melody,\\" became an international classic.Unchained (1955) Bartlett then acquired the rights to the first novel of Arthur Hailey, Zero Hour!, and made it into a suspense film. The film's plot was later used for Airplane!, the 1980 spoof of disaster films. Drango, a study of the post American Civil War era, was based on the true story about a Union officer who returned to the land his fellow soldiers had ravaged to try to rebuild the South, as Abraham Lincoln had encouraged before his assassination. = 1960's = All the Young Men, starring Sidney Poitier was about a black man's struggle to achieve first class citizenship. The Caretakers centered on the problems of mental health and was (at the request of President John F. Kennedy) the first film ever shown on the floor of the United States Senate. A Global Affair, a story about the first baby ever born in the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City, starred Bob Hope and Lilo Pulver. Hall's film, Sol Madrid, was made from the Robert Wilder novel, The Fruit of The Poppy. Changes, a strongly personal examination of the younger generation, was filmed in college communities across the country to record honest insights into issues of the day. The New York Times called the film \\"one of the most imaginative, haunting and artistic movies yet made. It is a remarkable film and ‚Äì more than that ‚Äì a remarkable experience.\\" = 1970's = The Sandpit Generals received international acclaim and was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. Bartlett's next film, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, based on the novella of the same name by Richard Bach, would prove to be his most famous achievement as a director. So fascinated was Bartlett by the story that he declared, \\"I was born to make this movie.\\" He commented, \\"I felt I had to make this film. I feel very strongly that we're in an age in motion pictures, in all the arts and in life generally, of negativity. People feel that the cards are stacked against them personally so that no one can win. I think Jonathan Livingston Seagull has been such a tremendous success as a novel because it is very positive on terms that any human being can relate to. It says that inside every person is the potential to be something more. By looking into yourself and knowing yourself and reaching for the best within yourself, you or I or anyone can have a different kind of life. That to me is the most needed thing of our time.\\"Questia.com However, the release of Jonathan Livingston Seagull was plagued by lawsuits. Bach sued Paramount Pictures before the film's release for having too many discrepancies between the film and the book. The judge ordered the studio to make some rewrites before it was released. Bartlett had allegedly violated a term in his contract with Bach which stated that no changes could be made to the film's adaptation without Bach's consent.Google News Neil Diamond, who wrote the songs featured on the film's soundtrack, also sued the studio for cutting too much of his music from the filmHaving Survived a Tumor and The Jazz Singer, Neil Diamond Eases His Life Back into Shape, Carl Arrington, People, April 5, 1982 The Search of Zubin Mehta is a story of an extraordinary family, eminently making a high place of cultural achievement in the world. The Children of Sanchez was written for the screen by Cesare Zavattini based on Oscar Lewis's book of the same title, a classic study of a Mexican family played by Anthony Quinn, Dolores del R√≠o and Lupita Ferrer (Bartlett's then-wife at the time). This film is better known for its Grammy award-winning musical score by Chuck Mangione. The film was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. = 1980's = Bartlett's final film, the 1983 TV movie, Love is Forever, was based on the true story of one of the most daring escapes in modern history. John Everingham (played in the film by Michael Landon) rescued his Laotian fianc√©e under the watchful guns of the Pathet Lao Army, executing an unforgettable, exciting, dangerous, and life- risking plan. The plan demanded a year's careful training and study, after Everingham, a top reporter, was imprisoned in Laos, then expelled from the country with a high price for his murder if he ever returned. Bartlett filmed Love Is Forever in Thailand. He is the first person to get permission to shoot on the Mekong River, two miles away from the Army of Laos. Landon and Bartlett clashed often during the production over a variety of issues Armstrong with Bartlett eventually editing the film in secret to avoid Landon's interference.p.26 Wheeler, Jill C. Michael Landon Abdo & Daughters, 01/09/1992 Personal life and death Bartlett was heavily involved in the Los Angeles community as a founder of the Music Center, a director of the James Doolittle Theatre, a patron of the Art Museum, a patron of the American Youth Symphony, a board member of KCET, and organizer of the Los Angeles Rams Club and the Los Angeles Lakers Basketball Club. At the time of his passing in 1993, Bartlett was finishing his second novel for Random House, Face to Face. His first novel, The Rest of Our Lives, was a best seller in 1988. Bartlett had partnered with Michael J. Lasky and developed a dozen projects for the eleven years prior to his death. One of these projects included the film Catch Me If You Can. Bartlett and Lasky both wrote and drafted many scripts for the project with Hall positioned as the director and Lasky producing. The rights were eventually sold and produced/directed by Steven Spielberg, nineteen years after Lasky's first option. In his last days, they were working on a three- picture slate which included the re-mastering of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The production team grew to include Robert Watts, known for being one of the producers on a number of Spielberg and Lucas films. Awards Bartlett's films have received ten Best Picture and Best Director awards at various international film festivals, seventeen Academy Award nominations, eight Hollywood Foreign Press Golden Globe Awards, and more than 75 national and international awards from publications and organizations.

It ran until its final 25th issue in 2010. The series was created and written by Robert Kirkman with art by Jason Howard. The first issue of The Astounding Wolf-Man was given away for free as part of Free Comic Book Day. A \\"director's cut\\" edition of the first issue was released the same date as the second issue. The story is that of Gary Hampton, a CEO who is mauled by a werewolf while on a family vacation. The story revolves around Gary's efforts to use his powers for good and to be a superhero, despite being plagued by a curse. Conclusion Robert Kirkman ended The Astounding Wolf- Man in 2010 with the story arc \\"Legacy\\". Although Wolf-Man's own series was concluded and all loose ends tied up, Kirkman pointed out that characters from Wolf-Man's universe would still crossover into his other characters' lives as they inhabit the same universe;CBR.com Wolf-Man himself appeared in the Invincible series several times, notably in a two-part storyline (Invincible Universe #8‚Äì9) sent as part of an extraction squad consisting of Popper, Mantis, Best Tiger, and Claire Voyant to capture a Brazilian super-criminal known as Redeye. Wolf-Man is momentarily distracted by the presence of Davi, Redeye's ward, and captured. Weakened due to his injuries and lack of moonlight, Wolf-Man seems to confuse Davi with Chloe. Davi aids Wolf-Man's escape as Best Tiger destroys Redeye's prison. As the prisoners and townspeople, left bloodthirsty following Redeye's depowerment, Wolf-Man, still weak, is unable to stop the riot and becomes separated from Davi. Fearing he has again failed to save a child, Wolf-Man returns to the base unaware that Davi has escaped harm and now possesses Redeye's powers. Characters * Gary Hampton aka \\"Wolf-Man\\" ‚Äì the main protagonist of the series; a successful businessman-turned superhero following an incident that left him with werewolf abilities. * Rebecca Hampton ‚Äì Gary's beautiful wife. Killed in Issue #7 by Zechariah; who she struck across the face after expressing her disdain for him; Zechariah, momentarily blinded by rage, responded by hitting her across the face, breaking her neck, and then fatally biting her neck, causing Rebecca to bleed to death. * Chloe Hampton aka \\"Vampire Girl\\" ‚Äì Gary's loving daughter, she is close to both of her parents. * Dunford ‚Äì The estate manager, butler and lifelong friend to the Hampton family; formerly a businessman whose company was bought out by Gary during his rise in the business world, Dunford was actually offered a position in Hampton Industries, but chose to retire instead. Following his wife's death, Dunford, who was friends with Gary by then, was invited to stay with his family as their estate manager. Dunford is Gary's closest friend and sees him as a kind and generous man who has only ever wanted to help people; a belief that leads to him to be the (initially) only one who believes Gary's innocence following Rebecca's death. Dunford is made Chloe's legal guardian during this time, and ultimately is successful in getting her through her grief. Killed in Issue #22 by Jacobsen and the werewolves following their attack on the Hampton estate. Gary, Chloe, Mecha- Maid and Elise attend his private funeral. * Maria ‚Äì The loyal maid to the Hampton family; reluctantly let go following Gary's loss of his company, which forced the family to cut back on luxuries. * Nathan Singleton ‚Äì A corporate CEO and head of Singleton Enterprises; Hampton Industries' greatest rival. Singleton himself was a rival of Gary for years, later embarked upon an affair with a lonely Rebecca ‚Äì and gained information from her about Gary's company that almost ruined him. Singleton, despite appearing to have taken advantage of his relationship with Rebecca in order to hurt Gary's business, was actually in love with Rebecca, and, even after the two ended their relationship, he was still happy to get back together when Rebecca distanced herself from Gary, during his early days as Wolf-Man, and reached back out to Singleton. Singleton was last seen attending Rebecca's funeral, alongside Chloe, Dunford and Gary and Rebecca's parents. * Zechariah ‚Äì A vampire who approached Gary immediately following his discovery of his abilities; Zechariah posed as a friend and mentor to Gary in his early days as Wolf-Man; teaching him all he knew about werewolves and how to control his abilities, as well as establishing his Wolf-Man identity. Ultimately, Gary's trust in Zechariah crumbled when he realized how much Zechariah was keeping from him ‚Äì when Zechariah tried to find and reconcile with Gary; instead he met Rebecca, and a confrontation led him to kill Gary's wife in a brief moment of rage. Zechariah left Gary to take the blame ‚Äì though was finally caught following his attack on Stronghold Prison, setting the record straight. Zechariah escaped with Mecha-Maid's assistance and, avoiding her trap with Gary, plotted revenge and kidnapped Chloe to mutate her into a vampiress. Zechariah was killed in the final issue, before he could succeed, when the Elder tore Zechariah's heart out of his chest and consumed it, killing him and reducing him to a skeleton in seconds ‚Äì finally ending his evil actions and interference in Gary's life. * The Actioneers ‚Äì A team of superheroes who are killed and revived as vampires by Zechariah to serve him; despite retaining their memories, their instinctive loyalty to Zechariah is overpowering and follow him completely. The team was finally captured following their attack on Stronghold Prison; which they participated in beside Zechariah and Chloe, in order to track down and kill Gary. The team is kept in isolation inside GDA HQ beneath the Pentagon. In the final issue, the team, immediately following Zechariah's death, is restored to normal. * Pamela aka \\"Mecha-Maid\\" ‚Äì A member of the Actioneers superhero team; who, being a robot, was instead disassembled and kept captive by Zechariah and the now-vampiric Actioneers. Mecha-Maid finally escapes when they departed, alongside Chloe, to attack Stronghold Prison, and Mecha-Maid followed and was caught in the fray, being captured by Face and his team ‚Äì but was spared at Gary's insistence and later joined him as his superhero partner (and possible love interest). Mecha-Maid later joins the expanded Guardians of the Globe and, accepting Gary's advice to let her child grow and develop on her own, constructs a robotic body for Elise. In the final issue, Mecha-Maid is seen happily reuniting with the restored Actioneers. * Elise ‚Äì The artificially-created \\"daughter\\" of Mecha-Maid; initially just a hologram, she is much later given a robotic body to live independently. * Agent Hunter ‚Äì An agent of the Global Defense Agency; who also has the ability to survive all types of injury and completely regenerate from his wounds, regardless of how fatal they are (e.g. decapitation). Hunter is placed in charge of the Wolf-Man investigation and, with his human partner and with the backing of the GDA and Guardians of the Globe, relentlessly track Gary down to arrest him, completely believing Gary murdered Rebecca, despite numerous attempts, on Gary's part, to change his mind. Hunter ultimately succeeded when Gary was caught at Rebecca's grave. Later, however, Hunter found he had been mistaken about Gary all along, and was ordered by Stedman to let go of his investigation after it was shut down. Hunter and Gary, apparently, made amends, and together join the expanded Guardians of the Globe. * Director Cecil Stedman ‚Äì The leader of the Global Defense Agency; Stedman is an enigmatic and very powerful U.S. government figure, who later becomes Gary's strongest ally following Rebecca's death, working tirelessly to aid him and later exonerate him for Zechariah's crime. Stedman later recruits Gary to the expanded Guardians of the Globe, and later gives his blessing to Gary's formation of his own team ‚Äì The Wolf Corps. He is the main character in the Invincible series; where his history and position are further explored. * \\"The Face\\" ‚Äì A powerful criminal with two-merged faces and a third laser- blasting eye, who was in de facto control of Stronghold Prison; formerly the most powerful member of a defunct criminal organisation known as \\"The Body\\" ‚Äì with Face being the last to fall and be imprisoned. Face escaped Stronghold Prison with Gary to the UK; and then released Gorgg, who betrayed Face and consumed him. Face was presumed dead, until he was found alive in Gorgg's remains during the salvation operation ‚Äì immediately asking he be taken back to prison. Gary later confirmed to Construct that Face was sent back to prison as requested. * Agent Donald Ferguson ‚Äì An agent of the Global Defense Agency; who is also a robot, and later joins the expanded Guardians of the Globe. He becomes a friend to Gary and Chloe following Gary's exoneration. * \\"The Elder\\" ‚Äì An elder brood werewolf and leader of all werewolves in the world; the Elder was responsible for attacking and giving Gary his werewolf powers, making him responsible for leaving Gary's old life in ruins, and his wife and best friend dead. In the final issue, the Elder confronts Gary for battle to test his worth ‚Äì explaining he had chosen Gary to succeed him as Elder of the werewolves so they may be redeemed and become great once again. After a fierce battle, Gary fatally strikes the Elder across his throat and he ultimately collapsed and bled to death ‚Äì a victorious Gary stood over his body, and the surrounding werewolves immediately bowed to their new Elder. * Jacobsen ‚Äì An influential werewolf under the Elder's command; Jacobsen first met Gary while seeking to kill Zechariah to avenge his murder of one of his children ‚Äì when Gary (apparently) does so, Jacobsen immediately declares he and all behind him will consider Gary an ally and friend to the werewolves. Much later, Jacobsen and the werewolves returned to attack the Hampton estate, declaring Gary was marked for death by the Elder; during which Jacobsen killed Dunford. Jacobsen was witness to the Elder and Gary's final battle, where Gary killed the Elder, as he had wished. Jacobsen and the others immediately bowed to their new Elder. Later, Jacobsen and the werewolves were taken in by Gary and, with Jacobsen's influence, forms the Wolf Corps under Gary's command ‚Äì Jacobsen, embracing his humanity, deeply expressed regret for his actions at the Elder's command, but Gary, having already forgiven him, stated all issues between them were settled and all were welcome with the werewolves. * \\"Gray Wolf\\" ‚Äì A werewolf, whose real name is unknown, who is employed as an agent of the Global Defense Agency; who originally \\"attacked\\" Gary, pretending to work for the Elder, but secretly gave him a hidden communicator at Stedman's behest, as apparently Gary saved Gray Wolf's life. Later, following Gary's defeat of Gorgg, exoneration and return as a superhero, Gray Wolf joins the expanded Guardians of the Globe. After a mission to shut down Impact's former employer, Gray Wolf revealed his identity ‚Äì he was the rooftop gardener who Gary, in his first night as a werewolf, apparently killed while mindlessly wandering the rooftops; explaining that, as he had terminal cancer, his new werewolf abilities, given to him by Gary who instinctively sensed his sickness, healed him of ‚Äì and then Gray Wolf, a retired CIA agent, found himself back in the spy game with the GDA, as a superhero; leaving him happier than he has ever been. This revelation finally gives Gary closure on this incident (as Gray Wolf's believed death had haunted Gary for a long time afterwards). In the final issue, it is implied Gray Wolf is now the Hamptons' new butler and estate manager.

Dullea (May 30, 1889 - May 31, 1966) was the Chief of Police in the San Francisco Police Department from 1940 to 1947. Early years Dullea attended Franklin Grammar and Lowell High Schools. After service in the Marine Corps, Dullea joined the San Francisco police force in 1914. In 1924, he was a police sergeant assigned to the Auto Detail's Shotgun Squad, a mobile police car unit assigned to patrol during night hours for motorized bandits. By 1929, he was Captain of Inspectors under William J. Quinn, serving during Prohibition, and later became a Captain of Detectives. Tenure as Chief of Police Dullea was appointed Chief in 1940 by Mayor Angelo Rossi. In 1941, Dullea ordered the San Francisco Police Department to assist in the roundup of Japanese-Americans for transport to internment camps, confiscating minor personal possessions; in February 1942 Dullea said his department was holding 6,000 radios and cameras taken from Japanese-Americans.Dullea, Charles W., Testimony of Charles W. Dullea, U.S. House Select Committee Investigating National Defense Migration [Tolan Committee] Hearings, 77 Cong, 2 sess., 1941-1942, Report. 77 Cong., 2 sess., 1942. H. Rpt. 1911. Serial 10970 During the war years Dullea presided over a police force diminished by conscription. In response, Dullea enlisted a police auxiliary consisting of 2,500 men and women, who were given a crash course in police work and trained in the use of firearms to assist in traffic duties and security at sporting events as well as crime prevention.Lotchin, Roger W., The Bad City in the Good Old Days, Indiana University Press (2003), , p. 204. With increased numbers of servicemen visiting San Francisco on leave, the department reported increases in the number of criminal incidents including drunk-and-disorderly charges, which Chief Dullea blamed on the increased number of servicemen on leave in San Francisco. On August 14, 1945, after President Truman announced the end of the war on nationwide radio, soldiers and seamen on leave in the city poured out of the city's saloons to celebrate in the street, resulting in a four-day \\"Peace Riot\\" of fights, gang rapes, looting and vandalism, leaving 11 people dead (including a municipal streetcar driver) and 1000 injured. After the deadliest riot in the city's history, Chief Dullea publicly expressed his disgust with what he termed, \\"the unbridled and unrestrained acts of a lot of undisciplined men in uniform.\\"Brunsdale, Mitzi, Icons of Mystery and Crime Detection: From Sleuths to Superheroes, ABC-CLIO, (2010) p. 354 Others blamed Chief Dullea for having no prepared plan to deal with the violence.Nolte, Carl, The dark side of V-J Day, The San Francisco Chronicle, 15 August 2005 After the war, Dullea used his position as Chief of Police to call for greater gun control efforts, including urging WWII veterans to turn in or dispose of their war souvenir firearms, and urged Hollywood filmmakers to publicize such efforts.Friedman, Alan, The Passing Parade: Souvenirs of Death, dir.

Education Hermann Br√ºck was born in Berlin. His father was Hermann Heinrich Br√ºck and his mother, Margaret. Hermann junior was educated at the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium in Berlin-Charlottenburg, a school specialising in the Classics (Latin and Greek), where he also had excellent teachers in mathematics and physics. Br√ºck, from 1924 to 1928, was educated at the University of Kiel, the University of Bonn, and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. His doctoral work on the wave mechanics of crystals was under the supervision of Arnold Sommerfeld. His interest in astronomy was gained early in life, and he turned his attention to astronomical spectroscopy. He was granted his PhD at Munich in 1928.Rudolf Peierls Bird of Passage (Princeton, 1985) p. 25.Sommerfeld ‚Äì Personal Data Br√ºck ‚Äì Biography, Royal Society of Edinburgh Career Upon graduation from Munich, Br√ºck followed his friend Albrecht Uns√∂ld to the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory; Uns√∂ld had earned his doctorate the year before, also under Sommerfeld. While there, he participated in the physics colloquium at the Humboldt University of Berlin with the physicists Max von Laue and Albert Einstein and the astronomer Walter Grotrian. With growing difficulties under National Socialism, Br√ºck left Germany in 1936 to take a temporary research assistantship at the Vatican Observatory. In 1937 he moved to the University of Cambridge to join the circle of modern astrophysicists around Arthur Eddington. In time, Br√ºck became Assistant Director of the Observatories and John Couch Adams Astronomer, specialising in solar spectroscopy. Under his tenure, he taught a course in classical astronomy and started the student astronomical society, which fostered the careers of many astronomers. In 1947, at the invitation of √âamon de Valera, Br√ºck moved to Dublin to direct the Dunsink Observatory, which was part of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, where he associated with Erwin Schr√∂dinger. In 1950, the Observatory, along with the Royal Irish Academy, hosted the first meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1955, the International Astronomical Union held their triennial Assembly in Dublin. At this gathering, the Observatory demonstrated photoelectric equipment for photometry, which had been developed by M. J. Smyth, who had been Br√ºck's student in Cambridge. Also displayed was the UV solar spectroscopy which extended the Utrecht Atlas and formed part of the revised Rowland tables of the Solar spectrum; Br√ºck's wife, Dr. Mary Br√ºck (n√©e Conway), was a leading figure in this work. In 1957, Br√ºck moved to the University of Edinburgh to be Astronomer Royal for Scotland. With his vision and drive, he transformed the Royal Observatory into an internationally ranked centre of research. He put together a team of astronomers and engineers headed initially by P. B. Fellgett and later by Vincent Reddish. This team created the automated instrumentation for scanning stellar and intergalactic images. This technology enabled spectra to be reduced in minutes rather than months, which gave astronomers time to focus on other activities. The team also advanced the technology for the remote operation of telescopes. In addition to his scientific duties, he expanded the teaching of astronomy with a new honours degree in Astrophysics, which started in 1967. On arrival at Edinburgh, he started the student astronomical society and gave it access to the Observatory. For a period, Br√ºck served as Dean of the Faculty of Science. Br√ºck retired in 1975. At this time, his second wife and colleague, Dr Mary T Conway, initiated an historical study of nineteenth century astronomy, which resulted in the publication of a book on Charles Piazzi Smyth, one of Br√ºck's predecessors. Their work also resulted in a book on the history of Edinburgh Astronomy, and a paper in Vistas in Astronomy on Lord Crawford's Observatory in Dunecht, which was the parent to the nineteenth century rebirth of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. Throughout his career, Br√ºck served as a member and councillor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

Playing career Kelly made his first grade debut for the Gold Coast in Round 18 1995 against St George which ended in a 46-16 loss. In 1996, Kelly joined Parramatta and became a regular fixture in the team over the next 5 years. In 1998, Kelly played in all but 1 of the club's matches as they finished 4th on the table and qualified for the finals. Kelly played in all of Parramatta's finals games including the heartbreaking preliminary final loss against Canterbury-Bankstown. With Parramatta leading 18-2 with less than 10 minutes to play, Canterbury staged a comeback scoring 3 tries in 8 minutes with Canterbury player Daryl Halligan kicking 2 goals from the sideline to tie the game at 18-18. Parramatta player Paul Carige then made a series of personal errors which cost Parramatta dearly in extra time with Canterbury going on to win 32-20. In 1999, Parramatta finished 2nd and qualified for the finals again. Parramatta once more reached the preliminary final against Melbourne. Parramatta lead the match 16-0 at halftime before a second half capitulation occurred similar to the year earlier with Melbourne winning the game 18-16. In 2000, Kelly played 28 games as Parramatta reached their 3rd straight preliminary final against Brisbane.

Having won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos travelled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Kelly playing at centre in Brisbane's loss. In 2001, Kelly played in 16 matches for Brisbane as they reached the preliminary final against his former side Parramatta. Brisbane lost the match 24-16. Kelly played with Brisbane up until the end of 2005 before retiring. Kelly's last match in first grade was against Canberra in Round 14 2005.

Trading at that time was concentrated on gold and currency transactions, however in the 1930s there was an inflow of French, Syrian and local Lebanese investment which made it possible for the BSE to flourish, especially with the establishment of mixed Lebanese-French joint stock companies that were quoted simultaneously on the Paris and Beirut Stock Exchanges.http://www.metametrics.com/beirut.html , Development of the Beirut Stock Exchange.

A pingo and polygonal ground near Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada Patterned ground is the distinct and often symmetrical natural pattern of geometric shapes formed by ground material in periglacial regions. It is typically found in remote regions of the Arctic, Antarctica, and the Outback in Australia, but is also found anywhere that freezing and thawing of soil alternate; patterned ground has also been observed on Mars. The geometric shapes and patterns associated with patterned ground are often mistaken as artistic human creations. The mechanism of the formation of patterned ground had long puzzled scientists but the introduction of computer- generated geological models in the past 20 years has allowed scientists to relate it to frost heaving, the expansion that occurs when wet, fine-grained, and porous soils freeze.  Types  Patterned ground can be found in a variety of forms. Typically, the type of patterned ground in a given area is related to the prevalence of larger stones in local soils and the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. = Polygons = Polygonal soil patterns, typical of the Arctic Tundra Polygons can form either in permafrost areas (as ice wedges) or in areas that are affected by seasonal frost. The rocks that make up these raised stone rings typically decrease in size with depth. In the northern reaches of the Canadian Boreal forests, when bogs reach a eutrophic climax and create a sedge mat, Tamarack Larch and Black Spruce are often the early colonists within such a polygonal climax sedge mat.C. Michael Hogan. 2008. Black Spruce: Picea mariana, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg = Circles = Partially melted and collapsed lithalsas (heaved mounds found in permafrost) have left circle-like structures on the Svalbard Archipelago. Circles range in size from a few centimeters to several meters in diameter. Circles can consist of both sorted and unsorted material, and generally occur with fine sediments in the center surrounded by a circle of larger stones. Unsorted circles are similar, but rather than being surrounded by a circle of larger stones, they are bounded by a circular margin of vegetation. = Steps = Steps can be developed from circles and polygons. This form of patterned ground is generally a terrace-like feature that has a border of either larger stones or vegetation on the downslope side, and can consist of either sorted or unsorted material. = Stripes = Stripes are lines of stones, vegetation, and/or soil that typically form from transitioning steps on slopes at angles between 2¬∞ and 7¬∞. Stripes can consist of either sorted or unsorted material. Sorted stripes are lines of larger stones separated by areas of smaller stones, fine sediment, or vegetation. Unsorted stripes typically consist of lines of vegetation or soil that are separated by bare ground.  Formation  Patterned ground in the polar region of Mars. In periglacial areas and areas affected by seasonal frost, repeated freezing and thawing of groundwater forces larger stones toward the surface, as smaller stones flow and settle underneath larger stones. At the surface, areas that are rich in larger stones contain much less water than highly porous areas of finer grained sediments. These water-saturated areas of finer sediments have a much greater ability to expand and contract as freezing and thawing occur, leading to lateral forces which ultimately pile larger stones into clusters and stripes. Through time, repeated freeze-thaw cycles smooth out irregularities and odd-shaped piles to form the common polygons, circles, and stripes of patterned ground. Patterned ground occurs in alpine areas with freeze thaw cycles. For example, on Mount Kenya seasonal frost layer is a few centimetres (inches) below the surface in places. Patterned ground is present at to the west of Mugi Hill. These mounds grow because of the repeated freezing and thawing of the ground drawing in more water. There are blockfields present around where the ground has cracked to form hexagons. Solifluction occurs when the night temperatures freeze the soil before it thaws again in the morning. This daily expansion and contraction of the soil prevents the establishment of vegetation. Frost also sorts the sediments in the ground. Once the mantle has been weathered, finer particles tend to migrate away from the freezing front, and larger particles migrate through the action of gravity. Patterned ground forms mostly within the active layer of permafrost.

Johann Baptist Straub (1 June 1704 (baptism) - 15 July 1784) was a German Rococo sculptor. Biography Straub was born in Wiesensteig, into a family of sculptors. His father Johann George Straub and his brothers Philipp Jakob, Joseph, and Johann Georg Straub were also sculptors, as was his nephew Franz Xaver Messerschmidt. J. B. Straub studied in Munich with the court sculptor Gabriel Luidl and then went to Vienna, where he worked from 1726 to 1734. In 1734 Straub returned to Munich. In 1737 he was appointed by Elector Karl Albrecht from Bavaria as the court sculptor. In the same year Straub married a daughter of the court engraver, Franz Xaver Sp√§th. Straub worked primarily in Upper Bavarian churches and monasteries, frequently alongside some of the greatest Baroque artists of the day: the architect Johann Michael Fischer, the painter Johann Baptist Zimmermann, the Asam Brothers, the Tyrolian painter Johann Jacob Zeiller, and the stuccoists Franz Xaver and Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, among others. Usually Straub's figures are carved in simple white, with very little gold trim. Important works by Straub are in the Residenz in Munich as well as in Schloss Nymphenburg. His best-known church works are the altars of the monastic churches of Andechs and Sch√§ftlarn as well as St. Michael's Church in Berg am Laim, a borough of Munich.

Ras-GRF1 has also been shown to be upstream from IGF1, allowing it to control growth in mice. Although it is sometimes known as CDC25, it should not be confused with Cdc25. Ras-GRF1 is a paternally expressed imprinted gene, meaning that only the paternal allele of the gene is translated into protein. Disruption of this epigenetic imprinting also produces learning and memory deficits in neonatal mice.

The narrator wants somebody to love, and he's also dreaming about a girl, who should be that \\"someone\\". Although, it could be a love song to alcohol. The song is from the year 1989. * \\"Armudes √ºksindusse\\" is about a man, who is left and is feeling lonely. He ultimately decides to cope with being alone. * \\"Charleen\\" is about an irresistible party girl Charleen. * \\"Teel √§ra\\" is about a man, who has to leave his beloved, although this is hard for him. Most likely, the reason for leaving is the difference between them. * \\"Suudlused\\" is about a girl, who's in love with a man, whom her parents and brothers dislike. They say, that she should fear that man, but the girl doesn't care, because she likes his kisses. * \\"L√µputu p√§ev\\" seems to be about injustice done to the narrator. It's Jaagup Kreem's favourite song on the album. * \\"Torm\\" is about unrequited love. It's one of Terminaator's biggest hits.

It claims to be the oldest continuously-existing Spiritualist community in the United States. Lake Pleasant was founded in 1870 as a \\"campmeeting grounds\\" with 75 tent lots, and by 1872 was popular with Spiritualists for summer tenting. In 1874 the New England Spiritualist Campmeeting Association (NESCA) was organized by Henry Buddington and Joseph Beals, and in 1879 formally incorporated. The village rapidly expanded to 90 small cottages, and around the lake were divided into many more camping lots. At its peak, circa 1900, Lake Pleasant contained 196 homes and cottages, swelling in August to as many as 2,000 residents. Lake Pleasant was one of a couple dozen Spiritualist camp meetings in the Northeast during this time, including Onset Bay, Grove in Wareham, Massachusetts, Queen City Park in Burlington, Vermont, and Lily Dale, outside Jamestown, New York. Emma Hardinge Britten, one of the many invited speakers at Lake Pleasant, painted this portrait of the community in 1880: Lake Pleasant's decline began in 1907 with a fire that destroyed 130 homes, and its fate was sealed when the lake itself became a public water supply off limits to recreation. As property values fell, many buildings were acquired by the water department for demolition. From 1913 to 1976, Lake Pleasant was home to two competing Spiritualist organizations, each with its own temple and followers, namely the original NESCA, affiliated with the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and The National Spiritual Alliance established in 1913. The two groups differed on questions of reincarnation. The NECSA temple burned down in 1955, and NECSA itself disbanded in 1976.

He won a silver medal in the 110 metre hurdles at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris with a time of 15.5 seconds. He was also selected as an All-American football player in 1899 while playing for the University of Michigan. He went on to coach the Knox College and University of Missouri football teams in the 1900s. He was dismissed from his coaching position at Missouri in January 1906 after being accused of paying money to a player. Knox College voted him into their athletic Hall of Fame in 2012. Athlete at Michigan McLean's hometown was Menominee, Michigan, a lumber town located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He enrolled in the University of Michigan where he became a star athlete in American football, track and field, and baseball. He played as a substitute on Michigan's 1897 football team and played left halfback for the 1898 and 1899 teams.https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1898fbt.htmhttps://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1899fbt.htm McLean was also a member of Michigan's track and baseball teams. In May 1899, McLean set the University of Michigan school record in the 120-yard hurdles with a time of 16-1/5 seconds. On the same day, he also broke a western intercollegiate record in the running broad jump by clearing 23 feet. In 1898, McLean played on Michigan's first Western Conference (as the Big Ten Conference was then known) championship football team. The Wolverines won the championship with a 12‚Äì11 victory over Chicago‚Äîa game that inspired Louis Elbel to write the University of Michigan's fight song, \\"The Victors.\\" McLean contributed to the win over Chicago with a kick return to the 50-yard line and a second kick return for 35 yards. In November 1899, McLean led the Wolverines in a game against eastern football power, the University of Pennsylvania at Franklin Field in Philadelphia. The Wolverines lost the game 11‚Äì10, but McLean's play at left halfback drew praise in newspaper accounts carried across the country. McLean made several long runs, principally on end runs. Michigan scored its first touchdown \\"wholly on a series of runs by McLean, around Pennsylvania's left end.\\" The score came on a 22-yard end run that \\"set the Michigan rooters fairly wild.\\" The New York Times reported that even the Penn fans showed their appreciation for McLean -- \\"his brilliant sprinting around Pennsylvania's ends often brought applause from the followers of the Quakers.\\" McLean's final game for Michigan was a November 1899 match against the University of Wisconsin played in front of 17,000 fans in Chicago. Newspaper accounts reported that Michigan's \\"crack halfback\\" McLean \\"made one of his end runs\\" with ten minutes to play‚Äîa forty-yard run for a touchdown. Another newspaper described McLean's final touchdown as follows: \\"the premier halfback, receiving the ball on the forty-yard line, bounded past the Badgers' left end, and at a high speed struck out for the goal line.\\" After the season ended, McLean received acknowledgement with his selection as a first-team All- American, including All-American selections by The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Fort Wayne News. Olympic athlete McLean competed for the United States in track and field events at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. He won the silver medal in the 110 metre hurdles with a time of 15.5 seconds. Alvin Kraenzlein took gold with a time of 15.4 seconds. McLean also took sixth place in the long jump with a distance of 6.655 metres, not making it into the top five who qualified for the final, as well as the triple jump, in which he did not place in the top six, and the standing triple jump, in which he did not make the top four.

Evidence was presented that Akerson, the star fullback on Missouri's 1904 team, was a professional who had been \\"hired\\" to serve on the team. Akerson had previously played at Knox and went on to become \\"one of the best individual players who was ever a member of a Tiger team.\\" McLean paid Akerson $250 out of his own pocket, and several alumni from Kansas City were to have shared the expense. However, the others \\"welched,\\" and when McLean wrote to them requesting that they pay their share, they turned over the correspondence to the university's athletic director. The news created \\"a real sensation\\" that resulted in McLean's being \\"dismissed in disgrace.\\" A Nebraska newspaper called it \\"the biggest scandal in the history of Missouri athletics,\\" and some even called for the abolition of football at the school.

They are used in overhead electrical wiring, to support radio antennas and overhead power lines. A strain insulator may be inserted between two lengths of wire to isolate them electrically from each other while maintaining a mechanical connection, or where a wire attaches to a pole or tower, to transmit the pull of the wire to the support while insulating it electrically. Strain insulators were first used in telegraph systems in the mid 19th century. Description and use A typical strain insulator is a piece of glass, porcelain, or fiberglass that is shaped to accommodate two cables or a cable shoe and the supporting hardware on the support structure (hook eye, or eyelet on a steel pole/tower). The shape of the insulator maximizes the distance between the cables while also maximizing the load-bearing transfer capacity of the insulator. In practice, for radio antennas, guy-wires, overhead power lines and most other loads, the strain insulator is usually in physical tension. When the line voltage requires more insulation than a single insulator can supply, strain insulators are used in series: A set of insulators are connected to each other using special hardware. The series can support the same strain as a single insulator, but the series provides a much higher effective insulation. If one string is insufficient for the strain, a heavy steel plate effectively bundles several insulator strings mechanically. One plate is on the \\"hot\\" end and another is located at the support structure. This setup is almost universally used on long spans, such as when a power line crosses a river, canyon, lake, or other terrain requiring a longer than nominal span. Strain insulators are typically used outdoors in overhead wiring. In this environment they are exposed to rain and, in urban settings, pollution. As a practical matter, the shape of the insulator becomes critically important, since a wetted path from one cable to the other can create a low-resistance electrical path. Strain insulators intended for horizontal mounting (often referred to as \\"dead ends\\") therefore incorporate flanges to shed water, and strain insulators intended for vertical mounting (referred to as \\"suspension insulators\\") are often bell-shaped.

It centers on Salt Creek and the impoundment of a tributary, Weldon Springs, to form Weldon Spring Lake, a reservoir. It is supervised by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Geology and ecology Weldon Springs is an unusual spring in the relatively flat Grande Prairie of central Illinois. The spring is a local reminder of the former presence of an immense buried river valley, the Teays River, once as large as the Mississippi River. Glacial till left behind during the Ice Age buried the valley and its bedrock bluffs below the current earth surface, but much later flows of groundwater were forced by this buried geological feature to the surface. Weldon Springs became a wetland with some of the northernmost bald cypress trees in Illinois. History In the 1800s, Weldon Springs was the fishing camp of a leading local citizen, Judge Lawrence Weldon. In 1900, Judge Weldon leased the springs to the Weldon Springs Company, which raised $7,500 to redevelop the springs as a Chautauqua. From 1901 until 1921, Weldon Springs - which was served by a branch line of the Illinois Central Railroad - was a recognized stop on the Chautauqua circuit; for ten days annually, inspirational speakers and entertainers took top billing on the spring garden's outdoor amphitheatres. National leaders who appeared at Weldon Springs included William Jennings Bryan, Helen Keller, Carrie Nation, the Rev. Billy Sunday, and President William Howard Taft. With the increasing availability of personal motor vehicles and distribution of movies, the Chautauqua circuit collapsed in the early 1920s. The Weldon family donated the springs to the county seat of Clinton in 1936, and the parcel moved to state ownership in 1948. It is the heart of what is now Weldon Springs State Recreation Area. Today When nearby Logan County, Illinois built its first-generation pioneer public schools in the 1860s, one of the one-room schools was named the Union School (1865). The name signifies the side Illinois took during the American Civil War at the time. After the Union School was consolidated about 1950, the building was moved to Weldon Springs and restored as the state park museum and visitor center. From the Union School and parking lot, more than 7 miles (11 km) of trails fan out. Local hikers will find the largest trees in the Salt Creek bottoms, including the largest tree in the park, a silver maple. The 1.3-mile (2.1 km) Schoolhouse Trail accesses a restored tallgrass prairie which provides habitat for more than 30 different species of butterflies. More than 80 birdhouses are maintained to provide homes for bluebirds. The spring-fed Weldon Spring Lake is managed for largemouth bass and channel catfish, with panfish also present. There is a power limit on the lake, with gasoline-powered motors not allowed. The campgrounds and amphitheaters used during the spring complex's Chautauqua days continue in readiness for use. =2008-2009 temporary shutdown= Weldon Springs State Park was one of eleven state parks slated to close indefinitely on November 1, 2008 due to budget cuts by then-Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.Dempsey, Pam G. \\"Governor closing 24 state sites, including Kickapoo State Park\\", The News Gazette (Champaign, Illinois), August 29, 2008, accessed August 31, 2008.

This species was named in honor of Reverend John Bachman. Adults have rufous brown upperparts and crown with gray and black streaking on the nape, back and primaries. The face is gray with a rufous brown eyestripe. It has a buff colored breast and whitish belly. These are mid-sized New World sparrows, measuring and weighing .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, John B. Dunning Jr. (ed.). CRC Press (1992), . Their breeding habitat is open pine forests. The domed nest is usually built on the ground near a clump of grass or a bush. Females lay three to five eggs. Bachman's sparrow is primarily a non-migratory resident, but it may retreat from some of the most northerly territories. The species is mainly a granivore, but it will also take some insects. This bird is considered near threatened by the IUCN, with habitat loss one of the major factors often cited in its decline. Habitat degradation due to later stages of forest succession has also been attributed to the decline of this species. Prescribed forest burns may assist in recovery. The song begins as a clear whistle, followed by a short trill. Distribution Bachman's sparrows occur primarily in the southeastern United States from the central region of peninsular Florida north to southeastern North Carolina and west through portions of Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri to eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas. Following forest conversion and the spread of agricultural fields up into the early 1900s, Bachman's sparrows rapidly expanded their range and began breeding in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania.Mumford, Russell E.; Keller, Charles E. 1984. The birds of Indiana. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press .Stevenson, Henry M.; Anderson, Bruce H. (1994). The birdlife of Florida. Gainesville, FL: University of Florida Press However, this trend reversed during the 1930s as much of the eastern deciduous forest recovered. Bachman's sparrows are thought to have been extirpated from Virginia in the early 2000s, and North Carolina is now the northern periphery of their eastern range. Among the three subspecies of Bachman's sparrow, Peucaea aestivalis aestivalis breeds furthest east, from southeast South Carolina to peninsular Florida. Peucaea a. bachmanii occurs west of P. a. aestivalis to Mississippi and north to Kentucky. P. a. illinoensis occurs in the westernmost region of the species' range. Timing of major life events =Migration= Reviews and a field guide summarize the limited information available on Bachman's sparrow migration.National Geographic Society. 1999. Field guide to the birds of North America. 3d ed. Washington, DC: The National Geographic Society Bachman's sparrows in the southern portion of their range are resident, while those in Missouri, Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia, parts of North Carolina, and extreme northern Mississippi and Alabama have been thought to migrate south during winter. Historical records suggest that Bachman's sparrows that once bred from Illinois to Pennsylvania did migrate to the south. Records of Bachman's sparrow occurrence on breeding grounds and specimens of subspecies collected outside their normal breeding range suggest that spring migration occurs from mid-March to May and fall migration occurs from late August through to late October. However, migration of Bachman's sparrows in the northern part of their current range is not well understood and it may be that suitable habitat conditions do no necessitate migration. Because of their secretive nature, determining the presence of Bachman's sparrows is difficult outside of the breeding season, when individuals rarely sing and perch visibly. However, examination of eBird data from recent decades suggests that several populations of Bachman's sparrows remain in North Carolina for the winter. =Breeding= Bachman's sparrows' breeding season typically begins in April and continues through August. The earliest date for Bachman's sparrow eggs in Florida is 14 April and the latest date is 4 August. The earliest Bachman's sparrow nest found during a study in longleaf pine habitat of South Carolina was 10 April, while the latest nest found was early in the incubation stage on 5 August. In a study of Bachman's sparrow reproduction in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, egg laying started as early as 17 April and continued until 26 August. However, 85% of clutches were started in May, June, or July. Bachman's sparrows typically raise 2 broods per breeding season and will renest after failed attempts. In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, the average time between fledging of the 1st brood and starting the second brood was 12.3 days. This was not significantly (p=0.39) different from the 9.7-day average period between a failed nest and a subsequent nest attempt. On average, females attempted 3.1 nests per season. The maximum number of attempts per season was five. The maximum number of nests attempted in longleaf pine habitat of South Carolina was also five. After two successful nests, a female attempted three times to raise a third brood. Limited evidence suggests that three broods per season may occur occasionally. Bachman's sparrow nests are constructed on the ground by females and are primarily made of grasses. All nests (n=71) found in a study in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas were built on the ground. Most nests (70%) were built at the base of bluestem clumps, although nests were found at the base of small trees, forbs, and other grass species. Bachman's sparrow nests are dome-shaped with an opening typically oriented to the north. However, there is some variation in nest shape and on the Arkansas study site above, only 7% of nests were not either partially or completely domed. Bachman's sparrow nest shape may vary geographically, as nests found farther north in their historic range were infrequently domed. Clutch size varies from three to five. Average clutch size on a site in Arkansas was 3.9, while in a longleaf pine community in South Carolina mean clutch size was 3.6. Both of these studies found significant (p‚â§0.02) decreases in clutch size as the breeding season progressed. On a dry prairie site in Florida (n=9) average clutch size was 3.44 and on another (n=5) it was 3.6. In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, females laid an average of 11.6 eggs (n=20) over the course of the breeding season. In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations in Arkansas, females incubated eggs for 13 to 14 days. The average nestling period was 9 days, and the average period between fledging and independence was 25 days. Both parents care for the young during these periods. A review suggests that Bachman's sparrows probably breed the year after hatching. Bachman's sparrows exhibit some fidelity to breeding sites. Over a two-year period in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of central Arkansas, 6 of 34 adults returned to areas where they had a territory in a previous year. This varied across years, with a 29% return rate of adult birds banded in 1983 and none of the adults banded in 1984 returning to the site in 1985. No juveniles (n=60) returned to the site. =Nesting success= Values of nest success reported for Bachman's sparrows vary. Daily nest survival rate of Bachman's sparrow ranged from 0.89 to 0.96 across sites and years in the dry prairie of central Florida. On average 3.13 birds were fledged per successful Bachman's sparrow nest. Estimates of productivity ranged from 1.21 to 4.16 offspring per pair per year across sites and years. In a South Carolina longleaf pine community, daily survival rate of Bachman's sparrow nests in 1995 was 0.952, which was significantly (p=0.04) higher than the 1996 daily nest survival rate of 0.889. Earlier nesting attempts (before June 15, n=15) had significantly (p=0.05) higher survival rates than those started later in the year (n=11). Daily nest survival rate was 0.922 during incubation and 0.973 during the nestling stage. In central Arkansas, daily success rate during the incubation period was 0.965, while in the nestling period it was 0.919. In the glades of south- central Missouri, 8 female Bachman's sparrows fledged an average of 1.5 young per season over 2 years. Predation accounted for 80% of egg loss on study sites in Arkansas and 94% of nest failures on sites in central Florida. Daily survival rates of nests in the Sandhills of North Carolina were 0.947 and 0.951. Nest survival in North Carolina and South Carolina declined significantly later in the breeding season. Information on Bachman's sparrow nest predators can be found in the Predators section of this summary. Cowbirds, nest abandonment, and prescribed fire are other known causes of nest failure. There are several accounts of Bachman's sparrow exhibiting nest defense behavior. One study recorded video evidence of a Bachman's sparrow successfully leading a cottonmouth away from its nest. In the same study, three individuals used ptiloerection and two individuals chased away an approaching cotton rat. There have also been some reports of Bachman's sparrows which feign injury or imitate the movement of a snake, even emitting a hissing noise, at the approach of danger. =Survival= Survival of Bachman's sparrows during the breeding season has been investigated in a South Carolina study area dominated by longleaf pine. Recapture of banded birds resulted in a monthly survival rate during the breeding season of 0.94. Using radio telemetry, average survival of Bachman's sparrows from 20 April to 26 July was 80.0%. In another radio telemetry study, four mortalities out of 38 Bachman's sparrows were documented over two years. The overall breeding season survival rate was estimated as 0.893. According to a literature review, Bachman's sparrows have been captured that were at least three years old. Preferred habitat Bachman's sparrows inhabit areas with a dense layer of ground vegetation and open mid-stories with scattered shrubs and saplings, including young clearcuts and open pine (Pinus spp.) forests.Chambers, Rachel J. 1994. Habitat relations of Bachman's sparrows and other birds on Missouri glades. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri-Columbia. Thesis =Habitat characteristics= Bachman's sparrows' selection of a dense layer of herbaceous vegetation is widely documented. Vegetation density was greater below 3 feet (0.9 m) than above 3 feet (0.9 m) and percent ground cover and percent grass cover were consistently higher (>58%) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrow than unoccupied sites in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina. In 17- to 28-year- old slash pine plantations of northwestern Florida that had been burned within 4 years, Bachman's sparrow abundance was significantly (p=0.043) correlated (r=0.46) with relative volume of grass. In longleaf and loblolly pine stands of varying ages and under different management in South Carolina, areas occupied by Bachman's sparrows consistently had high vegetation volumes ‚â§3 feet (1 m) above ground. Sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows in longleaf pine woodlands of Florida managed for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) had significantly (p=0.007) higher vegetation densities ‚â§ 2 feet (0.5 m) than unoccupied sites in the study area. Grass density, primarily bluestems (Andropogon spp. and Schizachyrium spp.) ‚â§ 2 feet (0.5 m) above ground, was also significantly (p=0.004) greater on occupied compared to unoccupied sites. Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p‚â§0.01) more abundant in mixed pine-grassland restoration stands in Mississippi, which had greater understory, grass, and forb cover, than traditionally managed stands. In 1- to 6-year-old loblolly pine stands of eastern Texas, herbaceous ground cover (p=0.003) was greater in study areas occupied by Bachman's sparrows. In south-central Missouri, glades occupied by Bachman's sparrows had significantly more grass (p=0.03) and forb cover (p=0.0005) than unoccupied glades. However, vegetation densities below 3 feet (0.9 m) and percent ground and grass cover in areas occupied by Bachman's sparrow did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from unoccupied areas of loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations in Arkansas. Despite an emphasis on grass and herbaceous vegetation under 3 feet, recent studies have shown that Bachman's sparrows show a threshold level response to grass density and actually decline in regions where grass is too dense. Because Bachman's sparrows often walk across the ground instead of flying, grass that is too dense may impede movement. Further, though Bachman's sparrows select home ranges with a relatively low density of woody vegetation, individual birds seem to select microhabitat within their range with greater density of woody vegetation. This may be due to the importance of woody song perches for males and woody vegetation as escape cover. Factors such as the patchiness of vegetation and species composition of the ground layer may affect habitat suitability by influencing foraging success and the availability of food and nesting material. In Georgia, Bachman's sparrows did not occur in open areas with uniformly dense herbaceous vegetation, despite these sites having a similar volume of vegetation ‚â§3 feet (1 m) above ground as recently burned pineland sites that were occupied by Bachman's sparrow. Although measurements were not taken, observations of Bachman's sparrow in clearcuts in eastern Texas suggest they may favor tall grass in clumpy rather that uniform distribution. In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, explanations suggested for a lack of evidence of ground layer features influencing selection of breeding territories included importance of habitat characteristics that were not measured, such as patchiness of the herbaceous layer and species composition. In a predominantly longleaf pine forest in Georgia, Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p=0.04) more abundant in areas where ground cover was primarily Beyrich threeawn (Aristida beyrichiana), compared to relatively disturbed communities of bluestems (Andropogon spp.) and silkgrass (Pityopsis spp.). Amount of litter and debris on a site may influence Bachman's sparrow habitat selection. Percent litter cover was consistently high (>58%) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrow in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina. Although statistical significance was not tested due to small sample size, Bachman's sparrows occurred at higher densities in control plots (1.5 territories/40 ha) than plots that had downed coarse woody debris >4 inches (10 cm) in diameter removed (0.4 territories/40 ha) in a loblolly pine forest of South Carolina. Haggerty suggests that litter may provide habitat for Bachman's sparrow prey, but that too much litter could interfere with foraging. In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, litter cover (78%) and depth (0.5 inches (1.2 cm) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p‚â§0.01) lower than litter cover (88.9%) and depth (1.6 inches (4.2 cm)) on unoccupied sites. Bachman's sparrow inhabits areas with open overstories. In sites in eastern Texas of varying age since clearcutting, study areas occupied by Bachman's sparrows had significantly (p<0.01) fewer short (‚â§ 10 feet (3m)) and tall (>10 feet (3m)) trees than unoccupied study areas. In longleaf and loblolly pine stands of varying ages and under different management in South Carolina, plots occupied by Bachman's sparrows consistently had low volumes of vegetation from 7 to 13 feet (2‚Äì4 m) above ground compared to unoccupied sites. In middle-aged and mature forests of Georgia composed primarily of loblolly pine, Bachman sparrow densities were negatively associated with tree/shrub volume and vegetation volume from 7 to <16 feet (3 to <5 m).Gobris, Nancy M. 1992. Habitat occupancy during the breeding season by Bachman's Sparrow at Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in central Georgia. Athens, GA: University of Georgia. Thesis In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, Bachman's sparrow breeding areas had significantly lower percent canopy cover (p<0.001), shorter woody vegetation (p‚â§0.01) and fewer trees (p<0.001) and shrubs (p‚â§0.05) than unoccupied sites. In south-central Missouri, Bachman's sparrows occurred in glades with less than 30% woody cover, and occupied glades had significantly (p‚â§0.05) lower percentages of deciduous and coniferous saplings, deciduous and coniferous trees, and total woody vegetation. Mid-story density was marginally (p=0.055) greater on unoccupied sites, and Bachman's sparrow abundance was significantly (p=0.043) negatively correlated (r= ‚Äì0.446) with mid-story density in longleaf pine woodlands of northwestern Florida. However, relative abundance of Bachman's sparrows was not significantly (p=0.107) associated with canopy cover and there were no significant (p=0.133) differences in canopy cover between occupied and unoccupied sites. There is evidence that Bachman sparrow may select sites with some tall vegetation. In north-central Florida, densities of Bachman's sparrows in young (2‚Äì4 years) slash pine plantations with artificial snags added (n=3) was 31.4 pairs/km2, while in similar vegetation without snags (n=3) Bachman's sparrow density was 22.3 pairs/km2 [8]. In an area in South Carolina composed of longleaf and loblolly pine, Bachman's sparrow occurred at significantly (p=0.002) higher density in clearcuts than middle- aged (22‚Äì50 years) stands, while in another area clearcuts had relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows. Vegetation differences between the 2 sites are likely to explain the difference. The site with relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows had been drumchopped, which resulted in a lower volume of vegetation from 3 to 7 feet (1‚Äì2 m) above ground. The authors suggest that the lack of vegetation in this height range may have limited perches, resulting in fewer birds on the site. An investigation of Bachman's sparrow habitat characteristics in 1- to 6-year-old loblolly pine stands of eastern Texas led to recommendations that 2 to 5 tall (>39 feet (12 m)) trees/100 ha remain on a clearcut for Bachman sparrow singing perches.Wan Ramle, Wan A. Kadir. 1987. Vegetational characteristics of early successional sites utilized for breeding by the Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) in eastern Texas. Nacogdoches, TX: Stephen F. Austin State University. Thesis In Georgia, the lack of vegetation from 10 to <16 feet (3 to <5 m) was suggested as a possible reason for the absence of Bachman's sparrows from open field vegetation. However, across the southeast, vegetation density from 3 to 6 feet (0.91‚Äì1.8 m) above ground varies widely on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows, suggesting their requirements for the density of this vegetation layer are comparatively flexible. In the dry prairie of central Florida, Bachman's sparrows used clumps of saw-palmetto that had \\"natural\\" burrows significantly (p<0.001) more than would be expected based on availability. The authors suggest that Bachman's sparrows in prairie habitat use burrows as areas of refuge from predators. =Landscape level effects= Several studies have investigated the importance of landscape attributes on Bachman's sparrows. For a discussion of the possible importance of patchiness of vegetation within a site see the habitat characteristics section. The ability of the Bachman's sparrow to detect and colonize areas before they are no longer suitable may depend on the size and isolation of the habitat. In south-central Missouri, only glades ‚â• 29 acres (11.7 ha) were occupied by Bachman's sparrows. The probability of Bachman's sparrow occupying pine-grassland restoration stands in Mississippi increased as size of areas with long burning rotations, short- harvest rotations, and no removal of hardwoods decreased (p=0.05) and as the perimeter to area ratio of these areas increased (p=0.02). In South Carolina, distance from source populations significantly (p‚â§ 0.05) influenced the ability of Bachman's sparrows to colonize recent clearcuts in both years on one study area and in 1 of 2 years in another study area. The authors suggest that the presence of corridors in the latter study area may have resulted in distance being less influential. Time since fire is an important factor in Bachman's sparrow habitat use. In Florida, Bachman's sparrows abandoned sites that were greater than 5 years post fire. In North Carolina, occupancy of Bachman's sparrows decreased with years since fire. Several studies suggest that optimal sites are those that have been burned within the previous 3 years, which highlights the importance of frequent fire regimes for the successful conservation of Bachman's sparrow. Bachman's sparrows' association with edge habitat is uncertain. In eastern Texas clearcuts with relatively abundant loblolly pine, sites with Bachman's sparrow territories were significantly (p<0.01) closer to the edge of the study area and the number of Bachman's sparrows was significantly (p<0.05) correlated (r=‚Äì0.22) with distance to edge.Brooks, Robert Alexander. 1987. Avifaunal populations of regenerating clearcut areas in eastern Texas, with emphasis on the Bachman's Sparrow and Prairie Warbler. Nacogdoches, TX: Stephen F. Austin State University. Thesis. However, in dry prairie of central Florida the difference in Bachman's sparrow densities in edge and core habitat was not significant (p‚â•0.36), and both edge and core habitat were considered population sinks. In North Carolina, Bachman's sparrow occupancy increased at intermediate distances (~250 meters) from wildlife openings. Bachman's sparrows may be dependent on landscape level factors at a large scale. An occupancy study in North Carolina used repeated point counts (n=232 points) to examine the impact of patch fragmentation and size on occupancy. They found that occupancy was very strongly correlated to percent of habitat within 3 kilometers. This sensitivity to habitat in the surrounding landscape may be related to dispersal but is not yet understood. =Territory and density= thumb Territory size of Bachman's sparrows varies. In Missouri glades, reports of average Bachman's sparrow breeding territory range from 1.5 acres (0.62 ha, n=13) to 7 acres (2.9 ha, n=7). In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of central Arkansas, mean home range size (n=25) during the breeding season was 6 acres (2.5 ha). In on a south-central Florida site with saw palmetto and scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia) interspersed amongst threeawn (Aristida spp.), Bachman's sparrow territories (n=6) averaged 12.5 acres (5.1 ha). In winter (November‚ÄìJanuary), the average home range size of 8 Bachman's sparrows was 1.6 acres (0.65 ha) in the dry prairie of central Florida. Bachman's sparrow density during the breeding season has been estimated in several habitats. On clearcuts of various ages with relatively abundant loblolly pine in eastern Texas, maximum Bachman sparrow density was 1.9/10 ha. In South Carolina, Bachman's sparrow densities ranged from 0 to 0.48/ha across sites of different ages and management regimes. In Georgia, Bachman sparrow densities ranged from 0 to 0.92 birds/ha on sites ranging from an open field to middle-aged and mature forests composed primarily of loblolly pine. In a south-central Florida community composed of saw palmetto, scrub palmetto, and threeawn, Bachman's sparrow density averaged 1 male/33 ha. In dry prairie of central Florida, Bachman's sparrow densities varied from 0.92 to 3.24 territories/10 ha across sites and years. Bachman's sparrow densities calculated from breeding bird censuses in longleaf pine forests was >15 territories/40 ha, while densities from winter bird population studies were from 6 to 10 individuals/40 ha.Engstrom, R.

Tallahassee, FL: Tall Timbers Research, Inc.: 127‚Äì138 Food habits Bachman's sparrows forage on the ground for plant seeds and arthropods. In a predominately loblolly and shortleaf pine habitat of eastern Texas, all Bachman's sparrow foraging observations were on the ground and a literature review states that Bachman's sparrows rarely forage in shrubs. Reviews and an investigation of the Bachman sparrow's diet in eastern Texas summarize the species that comprise the Bachman's sparrow's diet. A variety of grass seeds such as panicgrasses, bristlegrasses (Setaria sp.), crowngrasses (Paspalum spp.), and threeawns are eaten by Bachman's sparrows as well as seeds of several other taxa, including blueberries (Vaccinium spp), pines, and sedges (Carex spp). Arthropods in the Bachman's sparrow's diet include grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera spp.), spiders (Araneae), beetles (Coleoptera spp.), caterpillars (Lepidoptera spp.), wasps (Hymenoptera), and leafhoppers (Cicadellidae).Dunning, John B. 1993.

A 2019 study in Florida video-monitored 65 nests and recorded 37 individual depredation events by 12 total species. Most (51%) of nest predation was caused by snakes (black racer, corn snake, gray rat snake, cottonmouth, and coachwhip), followed by mesomammals (coyote and bobcat; 19%), rodents (hispid cotton rat, cotton mouse, and eastern wood rat; 16%), and fire ants and blue jays (14%). Predators were not identified for 17 additional depredation events. Bachman's sparrow nests are occasionally parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater). In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of central Arkansas, 5% of 38 nest failures were due to brown-headed cowbird parasitism.

Cummings (10 June 1858 ‚Äì 13 July 1919) was a Scottish professional runner who held the record for the mile in the 19th century and is perhaps best remembered for a series of races against Walter George, a top amateur runner who turned professional in part to challenge Cummings. Early professional career Cummings decided, by the time he turned 18 in 1876, to take up the uncertain life of a professional \\"bagtagger,\\" as runners were known at the time. His first professional race came soon afterwards. He ran the mile in 4:28¬Ω on 9 June 1877 and ran 4:25 the next year, as well as a two- mile race in 9:20¬Ω. His times were impressive enough to race for the Champion's Belt at Lillie Bridge on 1 July 1878. A long-shot, he won the race in 4:28 to become that year's Champion of England. He won a mile race in 4:18¬º later that year in Glasgow and again in 4:19¬Ω two weeks later, and was considered to be at the top of pedestrianism. The next few years were ones of mixed fortunes as he raced often and did not always win. He ran four miles in 19:57¬º in 1879, but lost his mile title to E. Dickenson who ran 4:20. He regained the Champion's Belt in 1880 with a 4:22 and won the 10 mile Belt with a 51:47 performance. Then he set a world record for 1¬Ω miles with 6:43¬Ω, but lost late that year in the mile to William Duddle who ran 4:19¬Ω. Chastened by his defeats, Cummings was determined to regain his dominance in 1881. He beat Duddle over 1,000 yards on 30 April with a world record 2:17, then he regained the Championship Belt on 14 May, setting a mile record of 4:16 in the process. The previous record had stood for 16 years. He beat Duddle two more times over the mile that year, and dipped under 4:20 twice in December. As a result of his dominance, professional running started to die. That soon changed with the emergence of Walter George, an amateur runner who set records in distances from 3/4 mile to 10 miles in 1882. After George had run 4:19 on 3 June of that year, thus setting a new amateur record for the mile with only three professionals faster at the distance - including, of course, Cummings - he challenged him to race, but was denied permission by the amateur authorities. But by 1885, George had conquered all comers as an amateur and sought new challenges as a professional. Being badly in debt was also a factor in this decision to shed his amateur status. The 1885 challenge mile The long- awaited mile challenge race was held on 31 August 1885 at Lillie Bridge, witnessed by some 30,000 spectators. Crowds of people angry they had been denied entry broke through the closed entry gates and ended up completely encircling the running track both inside and out. Cummings arrived at 5:30 pm and walked two laps of the track. George, caught in traffic, arrived shortly before 6:00 pm and climbed over the crowd with a ladder as the risk of injury pushing through the crowd was too great. Nevertheless, both runners had to force their way through the crowds with their handlers. Betting was heavy, with Cummings favoured over George. At the gun, George dashed ahead, with Cummings close behind, in a steady rain. Cummings, who had won the coin toss, had chosen the third-of-a-mile rectangular cinder track at the site over the favoured quarter-mile cycling track. At the quarter mile point of the race, hindered by the slow track with sharp corners, George led with 58, a torrid pace which the crowd enthusiastically cheered. But Cummings was close enough to be able to touch George's heels with his fingertips. At the half-mile point, they were at 2:01, and the crowd went delirious. At 1,000 yards, Cummings pulled even. At the three-quarter mark, George was at 3:07¬Ω, only half a second slower than the world record pace. Instead of slowing, George kept the pace, and Cummings struggled to keep up. Halfway through the final lap, Cummings gave up and started to walk, and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when he was far enough ahead. Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards in a time of 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap. Cummings got revenge later in 1885 by badly defeating George in a four-mile challenge race at Powderhall Grounds in Edinburgh, and in a 10-mile challenge soon after that back at Lillie Bridge. The 1886 challenge mile Their most famous encounter occurred in 1886, in a rematch of their 1885-mile challenge. On 23 August, again at Lillie Bridge, the two runners raced each other in front of 20,000 spectators. The starting gun was fired by former two-mile record-holder Jack White and George, as he did the year before, led off. The first lap was in 58¬º. Cummings followed closely, looking relaxed. At the half, George was at 2:01¬æ. As they completed the third lap, neither runner looked weak. As they passed three-quarters in 3:07¬æ, Cummings pulled up alongside George and the crowd went wild. Cummings launched a kick with 350 yards to go and opened an eight-yard lead. George held back, sure that Cummings could not hold the pace. Sure enough, George closed the gap, came even and then pulled ahead by two yards. Then, Cummings collapsed and George coasted to the finish. The spectators, in contrast to the congratulatory mob which surrounded George the previous year upon his victory, waited silently for the time to be written on the blackboard. When the time was written down‚Äî4:12¬æ‚Äîpandemonium broke out. Cummings' record was gone. And George's mark would not be surpassed for almost 30 years. Cummings got some revenge on George by defeating him in a four-mile challenge race, but George lapped him in a 10-mile challenge and was forced to drop out. In 1888, Cummings defeated George in a 3/4 mile race and two one-mile races, though neither time was faster than 4:30.

Accessed November 20, 2015. \\"Alexander, James Waddell M, Topology Born 1888 Seabright, NJ.\\" Alexander came from an old, distinguished Princeton family. He was the only child of the American portrait painter John White Alexander and Elizabeth Alexander. His maternal grandfather, James Waddell Alexander, was the president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Alexander's affluence and upbringing allowed him to interact with high society in America and elsewhere. He married Natalia Levitzkaja on January 11, 1918, a Russian woman. Together, they had two children. They would frequently spend time, until 1937, in the Chamonix area of France, where he would also climb mountains and hills. Alexander was also a noted mountaineer, having succeeded in many major ascents, e.g. in the Swiss Alps and Colorado Rockies. When in Princeton, he liked to climb the university buildings, and always left his office window on the top floor of Fine Hall open so that he could enter by climbing the building. Education He graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1910. He received his Masters of Arts degree in 1911 and his doctoral degree in 1915. Military career During World War I, Alexander served with tech staff in the Ordnance Department of the United States Army overseas. He retired as a Captain. Academic career He was a pioneer in algebraic topology, setting the foundations for Henri Poincar√©'s ideas on homology theory and furthering it by founding cohomology theory, which developed gradually in the decade after he gave a definition of cochain. For this, in 1928 he was awarded the B√¥cher Memorial Prize. He also contributed to the beginnings of knot theory by inventing the Alexander invariant of a knot, which in modern terms is a graded module obtained from the homology of a \\"cyclic covering\\" of the knot complement. From this invariant, he defined the first of the polynomial knot invariants. With Garland Briggs, he also gave a combinatorial description of knot invariance based on certain moves, now (against the history) called the Reidemeister moves; and also a means of computing homological invariants from the knot diagram. Towards the end of his life, Alexander became a recluse. He was known as a socialist and his prominence brought him to the attention of McCarthyists. The atmosphere of the McCarthy era pushed him into a greater seclusion. He was not seen in public after 1954, when he appeared to sign a letter supporting J. Robert Oppenheimer. Death and legacy He died on September 23, 1971. The Alexander's Chimney, in the Rocky Mountain National Park, is named after him.

In one of those races on 23 August 1886, he set a mile record which was not surpassed for almost 30 years. George's amateur career At 16, George was apprentice to a chemist (pharmacist) and working long hours. Accordingly, he entered cycling and then walking races on weekends for exercise. Before turning 20 in 1878, he trained for three months and boasted, to his friends' amusement, that he would one day run a mile in 4:12. This was at a time when the amateur mile record was 4:24¬Ω and the professional mile record was 4:17¬º. He wrote in a notebook then the quarter-mile splits required to achieve such a time: 59s; 2:02; 3:08. In his first race, he was given a 45-yard handicap and promptly won in 4:29, which caused the officials to withhold the prize money until they could determine whether he was a ringer. He never again was given a handicap. His unorthodox training technique, necessitated by his apprenticeship, was to do what he called \\"100-up\\" which involved running in place with high knee lifts and springing, and to take baths in brine. He found quick success, winning the 1879 Amateur Championships of England in the mile (4:29) and in the four miles. The next year, the first Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championship was held and George won the mile in 4:28 and the four miles. Then, on 16 August at Stamford Bridge, London, George held his \\"ideal\\" pace for one lap ‚Äì 59s ‚Äì then slowed to 2:04¬Ω and 3:14. Though he was disappointed to finish in 4:23, the time established a new amateur world record. On the professional side of racing, William Cummings was also running impressive mile times, setting a professional record of 4:16 in 1881 while George spent most of that year injured. But George responded in 1882 and ran another amateur world record in the mile on 3 June in 4:19, leaving only Cummings and two other professionals with faster performances. George applied to the AAA to race the professional Cummings, but was denied permission. Travelling to America, George faced the top American miler Lon Myers over a series of three races in November 1882. A total of 130,000 attended these races at the Polo Grounds in New York City. In the first, Myers beat George 1:56 to 1:57 in the 880 yards. The next week, George led all the way in defeating his rival 4:21 to 4:27 in the mile. In the final 3/4 mile showdown, 60,000 watched George and Myers battle on a cold day on a bad track. George led narrowly with a 61 and 2:02¬æ before Myers took the lead. But Myers staggered at the end and collapsed after crossing in 3:13 ‚Äì behind George who won in 3:10¬Ω. Both fell unconscious after the race and George described it as \\"the most gruelling race I ever ran.\\" In 1883, George was ill and William Snook won the mile championship, though George recovered to lower his amateur record for 10 miles. The next year, George sought revenge on Snook, as they met on 21 June at the Aston Lower Grounds in Birmingham for the AAA championships. George prevailed in the race at 4:18, setting his third amateur mile record in the process. That same year he won titles over the 4-miles, 10-miles, the 880 yards and in cross country. He additionally set world amateur records in the 2 miles (9:17), 3 miles (14:39), 6 miles (30:21¬Ω), 10 miles (51:20) and one hour (11 miles 932 yards). George turns professional: The 1885 challenge mile With nothing more to prove in the amateur world, George turned professional in 1885 and challenged Cummings over the mile. The long-awaited mile challenge race was held on 31 August 1885 at Lillie Bridge, witnessed by some 30,000 spectators. Crowds of people angry they had been denied entry broke through the closed entry gates and ended up completely encircling the running track both inside and out. Cummings arrived at 5:30 pm and walked two laps of the track. George, caught in traffic, arrived shortly before 6:00 pm and climbed over the crowd with a ladder as the risk of injury pushing through the crowd was too great. Nevertheless, both runners had to force their way through the crowds with their handlers. Betting was heavy, with Cummings favoured over George. At the gun, George dashed ahead, with Cummings close behind, in a steady rain. Cummings, who had won the coin toss, had chosen the third-of-a-mile rectangular cinder track at the site over the favoured quarter-mile cycling track. At the quarter mile point of the race, hindered by the slow track with sharp corners, George led with 58, a torrid pace which the crowd enthusiastically cheered. But Cummings was close enough to be able to touch George's heels with his fingertips. At the half-mile point, they were at 2:01, and the crowd went delirious. At 1,000 yards, Cummings pulled even. At the three-quarter mark, George was at 3:07¬Ω, only half a second slower than the world record pace. Instead of slowing, George kept the pace, and Cummings struggled to keep up. Halfway through the final lap, Cummings gave up and started to walk, and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when he was far enough ahead. Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards in a time of 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap. Cummings got revenge later in 1885 by badly defeating George in a four-mile challenge race at Powderhall Grounds in Edinburgh, and in a 10-mile challenge soon after that back at Lillie Bridge. 1886 challenge mile George (left), and Lon Myers Their most famous encounter occurred in 1886, a rematch of their 1885-mile challenge. On 23 August, again at Lillie Bridge, the two runners raced each other in front of 20,000 spectators. The starting gun was fired by former two-mile record-holder Jack White and George, as he did the year before, led off. The first lap was in 58¬º. Cummings followed closely, looking relaxed. At the half, George was at 2:01¬æ. As they completed the third lap, neither runner looked weak. As they passed three- quarters in 3:07¬æ, Cummings pulled up alongside George and the crowd went wild. Cummings launched a kick with 350 yards to go and opened an eight-yard lead. George held back, sure that Cummings could not hold the pace. Sure enough, George closed the gap, came even and then pulled ahead by two yards. Then, Cummings pulled up lame, and George coasted to the finish. The spectators, in contrast to the congratulatory mob which surrounded George the previous year upon his victory, waited silently for the time to be written on the blackboard. When the time was written down ‚Äì 4:12¬æ ‚Äì pandemonium broke out. Cummings' record was gone, and George's mark would not be surpassed for almost 30 years. Cummings got some revenge on George by defeating him in a four-mile challenge race, but in a 10-mile challenge George lapped Cummings, who was forced to drop out. In 1888, Cummings defeated George in a 3/4 mile race and two one-mile races, though neither time was faster than 4:30. George met Myers again in Australia in 1887, beating him in all but the 880 yards. Though George's 4:12¬æ was impressive, he ran some time trials in 1885 which were truly remarkable. In the first, two weeks before his professional debut against Cummings, he ran a 4:14¬Ω. Then, in Surbiton several days before the big race, he ran against some local runners with handicaps. His splits were 58, 1:58 and 3:07, and finished in a startling 4:10. Not believing their watches, the track was immediately measured: he had run six yards too far. No man would run the mile faster until 1931. In 2010, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

Of those two, WTMA is the only one to maintain its current call letters. In 1945, it added an FM sister station which today is 95.1 WSSX.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977, page C-187 From the early 1960s through 1981, WTMA broadcast a Top 40 format and was an ABC Radio News affiliate. But like many other AM Radio Top 40 stations, it switched to an adult contemporary format in the early 80s until 1986 when FM became more popular for music. It tried a couple different formats including an R&B-flavored; oldies format and country music. Then on June 1, 1989, it switched to its current news/talk format. WTMA has since then maintained its talk radio format, under the ownership of Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. In May 1999, WTMA lost popular syndicated shows by Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura to new talk radio competitor WSCC. Still, the station jumped from 13th to 7th in the morning and from 16th to 12th with 25-54 listeners. Program director Jason Wilmot said WTMA was still the number one station for news.

It was established by the Royal Decree (53/88) issued on 21 June 1988, to regulate and control the Omani securities market and to participate, effectively, with other organizations for setting up the infrastructure of the Sultanate's financial sector. After ten years of continuous growth, there was a need for a better functioning of the market. Thus MSM has been restructured by two Royal Decrees (80/98) and (82/98). History The Royal Decree (80/98) dated November 9, 1998, which promulgated the new Capital Market Law, provides for the establishment of two separate entities, an exchange, Muscat Securities Market (MSM), where all listed securities shall be traded, and the Capital Market Authority (CMA) - the regulatory. The exchange is a governmental entity, financially and administratively independent from the regulatory but subject to its supervision. The Market has developed its existing system of clearance and settlement, by introducing a new mechanism for ensuring stable dealings in securities, as well as providing a better environment attracting foreign investment into Oman. The former settlement mechanism was involving only three parties in the clearance and settlement: MSM, Muscat Clearing and Depository Company (S.A.O.C) and the brokers. The newly introduced settlement formula is through a settlement bank (Central Bank) with a Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF)., established with the contribution of all intermediary companies. The Muscat Securities Market is a member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges. Market classification The regular market has strict listing requirements. For listing on this market, companies must have a solid record of profitability. There exists also a parallel market with relatively fewer requirements, and is therefore easier for companies to list on, especially the newly established ones. There is a third market consists of companies that are facing financial difficulties. Legislative structure From its inception, Muscat Securities Market has issued instructions and regulations as required to ensure that it attains its objectives and performs its duties and responsibilities with the utmost efficiency and fairness, and in conformity with a technical platform of the new electronic trading system, with intensive working on solid infrastructure enabling trading through the Internet. MSM-30 index The Muscat Securities Market Index was established in 1992, and the base date was June 1990. The number of companies included in the index sample has changed over time to reach currently 30 companies, the most liquid in the market. It 30 has the following features: # Freely available shares for trading are included only. Any shares which fall under the following will be excluded: ## Founders (exclusion ends when the company issues two balance sheets for two consecutive financial years); ## Government holdings; ## Strategic holdings (10% or more); ## Locked-in shares, which are not tradable for at least 3 months. # A 10% capping (CAP) is set to ensure wider representation of smaller companies in the index. # The free float and capping has been revised (re-set) on a quarterly basis. The revision is conducted quarterly, by end of March, June, September and December. The index sample amendment, on the other hand, takes place in the beginning of July of each year. The sample is selected based on the applicable selection criteria (market capitalization, liquidity, and earnings per share). The MSM 30 index contains three sub-indices representing the three sectors (Banking & Investment, Industry & Services, and Insurance). Technology In the area of information technology, the Market has replaced of the present trading system, which has been operating since 1998, with a more efficient system from Atos Euronext France, which is a very sophisticated system used in many developed markets. The new system ensures provision of the data and information immediately for the supervisory authorities, to enable them activating the regulatory role in trading. The new system broadcasts the trading data immediately to all users and enables the market to add many investment instruments in the future and to make an easy link with the other stock markets in the GCC and other countries. Certification ISO 9001:2008 Muscat Securities Market has been awarded the ISO 9001:2008 certification for \\"Trading of Securities\\", and the ISO 27001:2005 certification for \\"Information Security Management System\\".

Usually one particular species is of interest. One important species studied by fish counters are Atlantic salmon. This species is of interest owing to its ecologically vulnerable status and anadromous lifestyles.  Methods of operation  Fish counters can be divided into three principal types: resistive counters, optical counters, and hydroacoustic counters. = Resistive counters = A resistive counter is associated with an in-river structure, an example constituting a Crump weir. The resistivity of a fish is lower than that of water. So, as fish cross this barrier, they pass embedded electrodes, and the difference in resistivity disturbs the field established in the vicinity of the electrodes, altering inter-electrode resistance. With three electrodes these disturbances can then be measured by a Wheatstone bridge, or other means, to detect the size and direction of travel of the fish. Fish counters of this type are used widely in Scotland to census populations of Atlantic salmon, where comparison with closed circuit television shows around a 97% detection rate. = Optical counters = An optical counter is also associated with an in-river structure. However, rather than pass electrodes, in an optical counter the fish interrupt some of a number of vertically arranged beams of light. The pattern of beam-breaks can be used to determine the size, profile, and direction of motion of the fish. Infrared light is used for minimizing the disturbance of the fish as they will not see the light when passing through the counter. When a fish swims through the net of light beams, the resulting silhouette image is used for counting as well as estimating the size of each fish. Each individual image is memorized in the control unit so that the counting can be verified afterwards. Some systems such as the Riverwatcher use the infrared scanner to trigger a digital camera to capture between 1 and 5 photos or a short video clip of each fish. The computer then automatically links the images to other information contained in the database for that individual fish such as size, passing hour, speed, silhouette image, temperature etc. The camera is installed in a special tunnel that contains both the camera and lights providing constant light, and same distance from the camera for the fish. That way, it is possible to get good images of the fish regardless of time of day. The performance of optical counters has been determined by studies, under various conditions, to be greater than 90%. Optical counters can also distinguish the size of fish more accurately than other counter types and so are particularly useful where a mixture of species inhabit a river (for example rivers where salmon mix with sea trout). The key disadvantage of optical counters is the small penetration of the beams through the water, restricting their use to narrow river features or in-river structures, an example being fish ladders. = Hydroacoustic counters = Hydroacoustic counters operate using the principles of sonar. A fish is insonified by a sound source and reflections from the fish are detected by an underwater microphone. The reflection occurs because of the sudden change in impedance to sound waves within the fish, particularly at the swimbladder (90% of the reflection). Hydroacoustic counters do not require in- river structures, but require skilled installation and operators. Without skilled installation at ideal sites hydroacoustic counters can be inaccurate. Studies typically indicate detection rates of 50% to 80%, though one study found detection rates as low as 3%. Careful planning and pre-siting study must be used to determine effectiveness. The lack of a requirement for any in-river structure makes the counters an attractive proposition. Generally used for short-term or seasonal studies, some situations require a long-term count which is accurate in absolute terms, not only in relative change (for example, no hydroacoustic sensors are routinely used in the detection of Scottish Atlantic salmon). In these instances resistivity or optical sensors tend to be preferred. Such methods usually require significant habitat modification, such as construction of a weir to funnel the fish through the counter. Recent advances in automated hydroacoustic monitoring systems has allowed continuous monitoring for periods exceeding 18 months. These systems include intelligent monitoring and real-time data processing, ensuring proper operation and publication of status and results (e.g. fish counts) on a routine basis.  Siting counters  = In river structures = Resistivity and (particularly) optical fish counters require in-river structures to direct the fish through the detection aperture of the counter. Fish ladders and Borland fish passes are effective structures for this purpose and occasionally a natural restriction within the river may be used for a similar purpose. However, for most counters a custom in-river structure will be required. One of the most effective such structures is the Crump weir, a triangular profile weir designed to ensure rapid planar flow over the detector. = Siting within the river system = A species of anadromous fish, such as the Atlantic salmon, may return to a particular breeding ground throughout its life. This means that within the larger rivers a number of quite distinct populations may cross a counter together, in aggregate. A population which uses a particular tributary may collapse whilst the overall numbers are not clearly affected. Issues with the management of that particular tributary and population therefore go unnoticed. Counters should be placed to count individual populations, rather than the species in aggregate, in order that population collapses and recoveries can be detected.  Alternative methods  The results of automatic fish counters can be supplemented, confirmed, or replaced by a number of alternative techniques, varying in accuracy, cost, complexity, and skew effects. * Electrofishing * Traps * Net and rod counts * Redd counts (disturbances in gravel caused by mating activities of some fish) * Closed circuit television  Notes   References  * Eatherley, D.M.R., Thorley, J.L., Stephen, A.B., Simpson, I., MacLean, J.C. & Youngson, A.F.

Opened in 1910, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In its heyday, the theater was known for catering to an African-American clientele, and had played host to many of the great Black musical artists of the early and mid-twentieth century. The Howard Theatre was billed as the \\"Theater of the People,\\" and supported two theatrical organizations, the Lafayette Players and the Howard University Players. In September 2010 extensive renovations were started to restore the theater to its former glory. The theater reopened on April 9, 2012 to headline acts like Wanda Sykes, Blue Oyster Cult, and Chaka Khan, all of whom appeared in the first month after its reopening. Early history Constructed in 1910, the theater was founded and owned by the National Amusement Company, a white-owned group. When built, it had a capacity of more than 1,200. Designed by J. Edward Storck, the theater featured orchestra and balcony seats and eight proscenium boxes, with a lavishly decorated interior. No less extravagant was the exterior, which combined elements of the Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance, and neoclassical styles. The whole was surmounted by a larger than life statue of Apollo playing his lyre. Howard Theatre at 620 T Street NW, with inset of manager, Andrew J. Thomas (ca. 1910-1919). Interior of the Howard Theatre at 620 T Street NW, ca. 1915. Andrew Thomas served as the theater's manager during its early years. Beginning in 1922 it was leased and run by actor, producer, and entrepreneur Sherman Dudley. It was taken over in 1926 by Abe Lichtman, the white owner of a chain of movie theaters that were frequented by Blacks. With the onset of the Great Depression, the building became a church for a time under the direction of Elder Michaux. In 1931, as part of the venue's return to its original purpose, Duke Ellington appeared with his band at \\"the Howard,\\" helping also to cement the theater's reputation as an entertainment hotspot. (found at Historical Society of Washington, DC library) This rebirth was helped along by Shep Allen, the building's new manager. In the 1930s Allen introduced an amateur contest that was used as a springboard to stardom by Billy Eckstine and Ella Fitzgerald. The Howard Theatre lost its original ornate facade in 1941 when it was redone in the then-fashionable Streamline style. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor would attend balls at the theater during World War II. These balls featured performers like Danny Kaye, Abbott and Costello and Cesar Romero, among others. Also in the 1940s, Pearl Bailey made her debut at the Howard Theatre. The Howard Theatre turned into a house for rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues during the 1950s and 1960s, when many important acts from both genres played there. Among the acts to grace the stage were Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Sammy Davis, Jr., James Brown, Lena Horne, Lionel Hampton, The Supremes, Stevie Wonder, and Dionne Warwick, Martha Reeves & The Vandellas, Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells The 1968 riots, which followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., caused the venue a great deal of harm. The riots, coupled with desegregation, contributed to the theater's difficulty in attracting patrons, and the theater closed in 1970. Three years later, in 1973, the Howard Theatre Foundation was organized to reopen the venue. It was this organization which succeeded, in 1974, in gaining the building historic landmark status. In April 1975, the New Howard Theatre Corporation presented an evening of entertainment to salute the reopening of the theater. Redd Foxx and Melba Moore were among the acts featured at the theater's reopening. Later in the decade, go-go bands played the venue, and Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers also performed at the Howard Theatre in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1980, the theater closed again. At the time it was the oldest venue in the country that featured Black artists. Under Mayor Marion Barry the theatre was purchased by the District government for $100,000. In 2002, the DC Preservation League listed the Howard Theatre as one of its Most Endangered Places in the District. Reopening In 2006, the Howard Theatre was returned to private ownership when Ellis Development was selected to renovate and restore the theatre. The District set aside $20 million in public funding for the renovation. Ellis Development, led by Chip Ellis and his son, Malik Ellis, formed Howard Theatre Development Group LLC. Through Howard Theatre Development Group, Ellis Development received nearly $12 million in District funds to redevelop and reopen the theatre. To oversee management of the facility, Ellis Development created the nonprofit Howard Theatre Restoration Inc. In September 2010, groundbreaking for extensive renovations of the theater was held. The project's goals were to restore the Howard Theatre to 600 seats, complementing developments at the adjacent Progression Place. Martinez + Johnson Architecture and Marshall Moya Design were responsible for the restoration, architecture, and design of the theater. The theater reopened for Community Day on April 9, 2012. The grand opening event was held on April 10. =Acts= Since its reopening, it has hosted a diverse lineup of well-known acts, including Vic Mensa, Anthony Hamilton, Raheem DeVaughn, Chrisette Michele, Tamia, Dianne Reeves, Gregory Porter, Esperanza Spalding, Jos√© James, The Roots, Slick Rick, Drake, Chaka Khan, Sizzla, Aaron Neville, Kendrick Lamar, and Sheila E, Keke Wyatt, Jon B.

Biography Preston Rogers Bassett was born in Buffalo, New York, son of urban planner Edward Murray Bassett and Annie Preston Bassett. Geologist Isabel Bassett Wasson was his sister. He received an A.B. from Amherst College in 1913 and attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1913-1914. He received two honorary degrees, an M.A. and a D.Sc., from Amherst College, and an honorary LLD from Adelphi College. He married Jeanne Reed Mordorf in 1919 and had four children. Jeanne Reed Mordorf was born November 1, 1893 in Trenton, NJ, graduated from Vassar College in 1915. They were married in Brooklyn May 24, 1919. Their home from 1925-1952 was 104 Broadway, Rockville Centre, NY. Career at Sperry Bassett worked for the Sperry Gyroscope Company for his whole career, where he rose from research engineer (1914) to Chief Engineer (1929), Vice-President in Charge of Engineering (1932), General Manager (1944), and President (1945-1956). He was also Vice President of the merged Sperry Corporation (1950-1957). He held 35 patents awarded between 1920 and 1937, including several for improved high- intensity carbon arc lights used in anti-aircraft searchlights and movie projectors. He helped Albert A. Michelson use arc light and gyroscope technology to measure the speed of light at Mount Wilson in June, 1924. He also developed the first soundproofing systems for airplanes and worked closely with Sperry founder Elmer Ambrose Sperry on several flight instruments based on gyroscopes, especially the gyrocompass, crucial to flying safely at night and in bad weather. The first blind landing (now called an instrument landing) was made by aviation pioneer Jimmy Doolittle in 1929 using Sperry instruments. Later life and work Bassett's many interests in addition to aviation included antique collecting, early technology, and history of Long Island and New England. He was President of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences (1947), Nassau Historical Society (1947-1954), Friends of Old Bethpage Village (1966-1970), and Keeler Tavern Preservation Society in Ridgefield, Connecticut (1968-1972). He served as Vice President of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities (1962-1972) and New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown, New York (1964-1975). He served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (1952-1961). He was a director of Abilities, Inc., a company that employed the handicapped. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Institute of Aeronautical Sciences. He was a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) from 1954-1958, when it became the present National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He was a keen observer of atmospheric phenomena encouraging others to look skyward to see the optical effects of clouds, raindrops, and ice crystals. He painted still lives and landscapes. He wrote books and articles on topics ranging from Long Island Craftsmen to Shadow Bands and Searchlights. His lectures to local groups on these topics were very popular. In his eighties and nineties he embarked on an \\"uncollecting\\" program in which he gave antiques to the Smithsonian Institution, Henry Ford Museum, Mead Art Museum, Old Bethpage Village, Farmers' Museum, Keeler Tavern, and others, always encouraging the museums to put his antiques into historical context. He died on April 30, 1992 at the age of 100.  References  *Bassett, Preston R. Life and Times of Preston R. Bassett.

Early life Born to Corsican parents in French Algeria, his father was considered to be a member of the colon class of French immigrants to the country. While Coppolani was in Algeria, he grew up among local Muslims and learnt Algerian Arabic. He was intrigued by Islamic practices and studied Sufism. Military and colonial career He was transferred to Senegal in 1899 to lead the expansion of colonial rule north of the Senegal river, where Moorish tribes held firm against French rule. This was disguised as an inquiry, whereas the goal of the mission was to lead to the subjugation of the local people. Local tribal rivalries provided Coppolani with an opportunity, and in 1901, he drew up a plan for moving into the territory with a combination of military and political strategies. Alliances were drawn up with two of the main marabouts of the territory, Shaykh Sidya Baba and Shaykh Saad Bouh, local leaders of Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhoods. They were promised a dominant role in the colonial administration and protection for their Zawiya tribes against the attacks of Hassane warriors. In return they would use their religious influence to persuade the local emirs to accept French rule. With military pressure applied, the strategy worked, and the emirates of Tagant, Trarza and Brakna all accepted French rule in 1903-04. The last emirate, in the northern zone of Adrar, proved combative. It was also backed by a third influential Qadiriyya marabout, shaykh Ma al-'Aynayn, himself in turn supported by the Sultan of Morocco. Coppolani was preparing to march on Adrar when he was killed in 1905, by a member of the shaykh's Gudfiyya brotherhood. The emirate was eventually defeated and forcibly incorporated into Mauritania in 1912, by General Gouraud, but tribal revolts and raids persisted until 1934.

The blast engulfed a carriage of the train in flames, killing three and injuring five others. One of the dead and the most seriously injured survivor were volunteers of the IRA. After the blast, the organisation issued a statement acknowledging responsibility, apologising to those who were harmed and stated that it was 'grave and distressing' but an 'accident' caused by the 'war situation'.F.A.C.T. Train bomb 18 Jan 1980 , retrieved 4 March 2007 The explosion The train was a Northern Ireland Railways afternoon service carrying passengers between Ballymena railway station and Belfast Central railway station. The train was largely empty as it left Dunmurry railway station and entered the outskirts of Belfast, crossing under the M1 motorway on its way to Finaghy railway station shortly before 4.55 p.m., when a large fireball erupted in the rear carriage, bringing the train to a standstill and forcing panicked passengers to evacuate urgently as the smoke and flames spread along the train. The survivors then moved down the track in single file to safety whilst emergency services fought the blaze. After several hours and combined efforts from fire, police and military services the blaze was contained. One fireman was treated for minor injuries. The two damaged carriages were transported to Queen's Quay in Belfast for forensic examination and were subsequently rebuilt. One remaining in service until 2006 and the other until 2012. Of the four persons occupying the carriage, three were killed with burns so severe that it was not possible to identify them by conventional means. Rail chief Roy Beattie described the human remains as \\"three heaps of ashes\\". The fourth, later identified as Patrick Joseph Flynn, was an IRA member and one of the men transporting the bombs. He suffered very serious burns to his face, torso and legs, and was reported to be close to death upon arrival at the hospital. Of the dead, two were eventually named as 17-year-old Protestant student Mark Cochrane from Finaghy and the other a 35-year-old Belfast-based accountant and recent immigrant from Lagos, Nigeria, Max Olorunda, who had been visiting a client in Ballymena. He left a wife Gabrielle, a Catholic nurse originally from Strabane, and three daughters; the youngest Jayne, is an author and a cross- community worker. Aged two at the time of the bombing, she has written a book about the aftermath of her father's death. Max Olorunda was the first African civilian and only Nigerian to have been killed in the Troubles.\\"Daughter of Nigerian IRA victim writes 'Legacy' book. News Letter. Belfast. 20 September 2013 retrieved 25 May 2015 The identity of the third was harder to ascertain, but it was eventually confirmed by the IRA by their statement that he was 26-year-old IRA member Kevin Delaney, father of one with a pregnant wife.CAIN Sutton Index of Deaths 1980, retrieved 4 March 2007 In addition to the fireman, four people were injured, including Flynn, two teenagers treated for minor injuries and an older man who had suffered much more serious burns. Further bomb alerts were issued across the region and two similar devices discovered on trains, at York Road railway station in Belfast and at Greenisland railway station. Both were removed safely and control detonated. The devices were simple incendiary bombs similar to that which exploded south of Befast, consisting of a 5lb block of explosives attached to a petrol can with a simple time device intended to delay the explosion until the train was empty that evening. Later testimony indicated that Delaney had armed the first of two bombs and placed it beside him as he picked up the second one. As he armed this device, the first bomb suddenly detonated for reasons that remain unknown. Delaney was killed instantly and his accomplice, Patrick Joseph Flynn, was forced to leap from the train in flames. Flynn was guarded by police in hospital and arrested once his wounds had healed sufficiently. Reactions The IRA released a lengthy statement about the event, terming it a 'bombing tragedy', blaming the Royal Ulster Constabulary for their 'sickening and hypocritical ... collective activity of collaboration with the British forces' and stating: > The explosion occurred prematurely and the intended target was not the > civilians travelling on the train. We always take the most stringent > precautions to ensure the safety of all civilians in the vicinity of a > military or commercial bombing operation. The bombing mission on Thursday > night was not an exception to this principle. Unfortunately the unexpected > is not something we can predict or prevent in the war situation this country > is in, the consequences of the unexpected are often grave and distressing, > as Thursday night's accident shows. > ... > Our sorrow at losing a young married man, Kevin Delaney is heightened by the > additional deaths of Mr. Olorunda and Mark Cochrane. To all their bereaved > families we offer our dearest and heartfelt sympathy. In Britain, Conservative MP Winston Churchill called for the death penalty to be reinstated for terrorists as a result of this incident. The RUC responded to the IRA's announcement with a short statement stating that: > The fact is that innocent people are dead and the Provisional IRA are > responsible, as they have been on hundreds of other occasions. Once again > they stand condemned in the eyes of the civilised world. This was not the first occasion in which an IRA bomb on a train killed or wounded someone. On 12 October 1978, 55-year-old Letitia McCrory was killed by an IRA bomb explosion on the Belfast-Dublin line near Belfast Central station.CAIN Sutton Index of Deaths 1978, retrieved 4 March 2007 The CAIN database indicates that in the 1978 explosion, an inadequate warning was given thus not allowing authorities time to evacuate the train completely before the device detonated.CAIN Chronology of the conflict 1978, retrieved 4 March 2007 Prosecution 24-year-old Patrick Flynn was tried at Belfast Crown Court for double manslaughter and possession of explosives after his recovery from his injuries. Flynn was severely disfigured and badly scarred from the extensive burns the incendiary device had inflicted upon him. The judge was asked and agreed to take this into account for sentencing after reviewing the evidence and finding Flynn guilty due to his proximity to the explosion, his known IRA affiliation and the discovery of telephone numbers for The Samaritans and Belfast Central station in his jacket, to be used to telephone bomb warnings. Mr Justice Kelly sentenced Flynn to ten years prison for each manslaughter as well as seven years for the explosives offences, to be served concurrently. He concluded by summing up with the words: > I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt you were one of the bombers. I am > satisfied you and your associates did not intend to kill. Nevertheless, the > explosion and fire caused the death of three people in most horrific > circumstances. In sentencing you I am conscious you have suffered severe > burns and scars, for the rest of your life which will be a grim reminder to > you of the events of that day.

The bridge consists of four resistors and two capacitors. At the time of the Wien bridge's invention, bridge circuits were a common way of measuring component values by comparing them to known values. Often an unknown component would be put in one arm of a bridge, and then the bridge would be nulled by adjusting the other arms or changing the frequency of the voltage source. See, for example, the Wheatstone bridge. The Wien bridge is one of many common bridges. Wien's bridge is used for precision measurement of capacitance in terms of resistance and frequency. citing It was also used to measure audio frequencies. The Wien bridge does not require equal values of R or C. At some frequency, the reactance of the series R2-C2 arm will be an exact multiple of the shunt Rx-Cx arm. If the two R3 and R4 arms are adjusted to the same ratio, then the bridge is balanced. The bridge is balanced when: :\\\\omega^2 = {1 \\\\over R_x R_2 C_x C_2} and {C_x \\\\over C_2} = {R_4 \\\\over R_3} - {R_2 \\\\over R_x} \\\\, . The equations simplify if one chooses R2 = Rx and C2 = Cx; the result is R4 = 2R3. In practice, the values of R and C will never be exactly equal, but the equations above show that for fixed values in the 2 and x arms, the bridge will balance at some œâ and some ratio of R4/R3.

They occupied an area which is now the Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach areas. To their west were the members of the Nansemond tribe. The main village of the Chesepian was called Skicoke, located in the present independent city of Norfolk. The exact location of Skicoak is unknown. It may have been near the junction of the Eastern and Southern Branches of the Elizabeth River in downtown Norfolk. Other evidence suggests it was located in the Pine Beach area of Sewell's Point. At that location, a large Native American burial mound was discovered close to the 20th-century community named Algonquin Village. The Chesepian also had two other towns (or villages), Apasus and Chesepioc, both near the Chesapeake Bay in what is now the independent city of Virginia Beach. Of these, Chesepioc was known to have been located in the present Great Neck area. Archaeologists and other persons have found numerous Native American artifacts, such as arrowheads, stone axes, pottery and beads in Great Neck Point. Several buried remains of the indigenous people have been found in this area as well. Although they were eastern-Algonquian-speaking, as were the thousands of members of the Powhatan Confederacy, the archaeological evidence suggests that the original Chesepian people belonged to another group, the Carolina Algonquian. According to William Strachey's The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia (1618), the Chesepian were wiped out by the Powhatan, the paramount head of the Virginia Peninsula-based Powhatan Confederacy, some time before the arrival of the English at Jamestown in 1607. The Chesepian were eliminated because Powhatan's priests had warned him that \\"from the Chesapeake Bay a nation should arise, which should dissolve and give end to his empire\\".William Strachey.

He migrated from Mumbai to Dhaka in former East Pakistan and started a trading business dealing in electrical goods and home appliances, Radios and TVs, Wire & Cable and Automobiles. Shortly afterwards, the business entered a joint venture with Japan to manufacture Toshiba radio sets. The company was a pioneer in setting up technical collaboration with Japan. The business soon expanded and industrial activities commenced in the western wing of Pakistan, where he secured the agency of tractors. In fact, the Group's pace of development was so fast that it soon flowered into two Sugar Mills, a Tractor Plant, Cement Plant, two Paper Sack Units, Particle and MDF Board Plant. From 1970 onwards, the group has diversified its activities form trading to industrial production. This started with the acquisition of Adamjee now Fecto Sugar Mills Limited in early 1975, followed by the establishment of another sugar mills in 1978. Bolstered by its initial successes, the group ventured into progressive manufacturing of agricultural tractors and farm equipment including agricultural implements of various types.

Minister of State of Augusto Pinochet and President of the Central Bank in the same administration Upon getting his Master in Economics at University of Chicago, Miguel Kast joined Odeplan (1973), the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973. At Odeplan, Miguel Kast focused most of his energies on creating the \\"map of extreme poverty\\", which would become the cornerstone of Chile's social development programs. In 1978 he became the head of Odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join Odeplan and by sending them to the country's outer regions to get insight into the real problems of Chile. In 1980 Miguel Kast became Labor Minister under the Military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and in April 1982 he became President of the Central Bank of Chile. This was a complicated moment in Chile's economy; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and Chile's big economic groups had liabilities with their own banks. As a Central Banker he worked to reduce the level of related loans (loans made to the owners of the banks). He also created a mechanism called the \\"Portfolio Sale\\" through which the Central Bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks. By keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar, Miguel Kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars. However the central authority saw it otherwise and on June 13, 1982 decided to devalue the peso. This brought a sharp loss of international reserves and Miguel Kast decided in August 1982 to completely free exchange rate thus further devaluing the peso and bringing a new intervention from the central authority. Under this new threat of instability, Miguel Kast resigned from the Central Bank, effective on 2 September. Towards the end of 1982 Kast wanted to leave the life of government and dedicate himself to the private business world and his professorships at the Catholic University, but it was at this same time that he began to feel unwell and to present signs of physical weakness and a pale appearance. In January 1983 he was diagnosed with bone cancer; it was at that very moment that Kast took refuge in his family and friends, but mainly in his Catholic faith. It was a fulminant cancer that took his life on September 18, 1983. Two of his relatives are involved in politics too: his younger brother Jos√© Antonio, and one of his children, Felipe Kast.

To pretend she had cleared it entirely, she swallowed the petal and became pregnant. She bore a daughter, named her Lisa, and gave her to fairies to raise. The fairies gave her gifts, but one twisted her ankle and cursed Lisa to die when she was seven, because her mother, combing her hair, forgot the comb in her hair. This happened, and the lamenting mother put her in seven crystal coffins and put them in a room. Her health failed. Before she died, she gave her brother the key to the room and make him promise not to open it. He obeyed, but he married, and one day while he hunted, his wife opened the door. Jealous of the girl's beauty, she pulled her out by her hair, which knocked out the comb and brought her back to life. The woman beat her and made her a slave, telling her husband that her aunt had sent her a slave and warned her that stern measures were necessary with this perverse slave. The baron went to the fair and asked everyone for what they wanted. Lisa asked for a doll, a knife, and some pumice-stone, and cursed him not be able to cross a river to return if he did not. He forgot them, but the river swelled, reminding him. Lisa took them to the kitchen and told her story to the doll, and then threatened to sharpen the knife on the stone and kill herself if the doll did not answer. The doll did. After several days of this, the baron heard this and eavesdropped. When the girl began to whet the knife, he broke into the kitchen and took it from her. Then he put Lisa in the care of a relative, where she regained her health and beauty. The baron brought her to his own home, dismissed his wife back to her relatives, and in due course married off his niece.

Broadcasting at 101.5 FM, the station airs an adult contemporary format branded as 101.5 EZ Rock. The station is owned by Bell Media. History The station traces its origins to December 21, 1984 when the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission awarded a new FM license for the Kelowna market to Silk FM Broadcasting, a company two-thirds controlled by veteran radio broadcaster Nick Frost.Decision CRTC 84-1050 CILK-FM signed on for the first time at 101.5 MHz with a soft adult contemporary format at 10 AM on June 21, 1985, with an average effective radiated power of 11,000 watts. The transmitter had a northward-directed pattern from the 3,200 foot level of Okanagan Mountain, 7 kilometres south of Kelowna city centre. On May 7, 1993, Silk FM Broadcasting applied to amend its broadcasting licence by relocating the transmitter site on Okanagan Mountain approximately three kilometres to the south and by decreasing the effective radiated power from 11,000 to 10,300 watts. The applicant indicated these changes would improve service to the Central Okanagan area. On July 19 of the same year, the CRTC approved the application. In 1995, Frost hired a single employee, David E. Fowler, whose mandate was to start up an internet service provider: Silk Internet. The workplace, and all the associated equipment, was set up in the lobby of the radio station. A systems administrator, Stephen Hawtree, was hired soon afterwards to assist with the technical operations. By the end of the first week of operation there were five brand new Internet subscribers and within two years it became Kelowna's largest internet providers. Within five years the subscriber list was up to about 6,000. In 2000, the Silk Internet was sold to Pacific Coast Net, which itself was subsequently sold to Uniserve Communications. That same year, Silk FM Broadcasting launched an online news and local information web portal Castanet.net. CILK's former logo, used until December 2010. In 2004, the station adopted an adult hits format. On October 5, the CRTC announced that Silk FM Broadcasting had applied to add rebroadcast transmitters in the nearby Okanagan cities of Vernon and Penticton, in addition to its owned and operated rebroadcast transmitters at Big White Mountain and Magna Bay. On February 28, 2005, the CRTC denied the application to add the transmitters into Vernon and Penticton on the grounds that it would result in a significant increase to the coverage of CILK-FM into the adjacent radio markets. On May 3, 2006, several years after Frost bought out minority shareholders of Silk FM Broadcasting and became sole owner of the company, he announced the sale of CILK-FM and its two broadcast transmitters to Standard Radio for a total purchase price of $9.25 million CAD. The sale was approved unconditionally by the CRTC in December 2006. In the summer of 2007, Silk FM modified its format to adult contemporary, playing contemporary and modern hits. In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CILK-FM. By January 2011, the station became 101.5 EZ Rock, keeping the adult contemporary format. By March 2011, the station was added at the Canadian hot AC panel per Mediabase status, joining sister contemporary hit radio station CHSU-FM, but later moved to the Canadian AC panel the following week.

Biography  Nieves Conde, part of a large family and with a military father, was interested in film from the time he was a child. Upon finishing secondary school in Segovia, he began to study law in Madrid, joining the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS (Spanish Phalanx of the Councils of the National Syndicalist Offensive), a fascist political party, whose social ideology would have a profound impact on his cinematographic works. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the front as a voluntary Falangist as part of the Nationalist or Rebel faction, opposing the unification of the Falange and the Requet√©s decreed by Franco, allying himself in the Falangist faction with the \\"hedillistas\\" (supporters of Manuel Hedilla, the successor of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, at the head of the Falange that was opposed to the unification as decreed by Franco) and reaching the rank of Infantry Second Lieutenant. He did not complete his university studies. At the end of the war he returned to Segovia where he worked in the press and radio until he returned to Madrid to become a movie critic for the newspaper Pueblo. Between 1939 and 1942 he was an editor at the film magazine Primer Plano in charge of the section \\"Fuera de cuadro\\" (off- screen). A friend of Carlos Fern√°ndez-Cuenca, Luis G√≥mez Mesa, and Rafael Gil, he began to work professionally in film with Gil in 1941 as a directing assistant. He worked with Gil on five of his movies from 1941‚Äì1946, including Viaje sin destino [Journey to Nowhere] (1942) and Tierra sedienta [Thirsty Land] (1945). From 1942 onward he left Primer Plano and Pueblo‚Äîseemingly over disagreements over its direction‚Äîand dedicated himself professionally to film.  Cinematographic Work  He directed his first film, Senda ignorada [Unknown Path] (1946), a gangster movie set in the United States, in 1946. This was followed by Angustia [Anguish] (1947), featuring Rafael Bardem and Julia Caba Alba, another crime film, which was declared of \\"national interest,\\" and Llegada la noche [Night Arrival] (1949), with a script from Carlos Blanco. In 1950 he directed Balarrasa [Reckless] (1950) with a script from Vicente Escriv√° and with actors such as Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez, Mar√≠a Rosa Salgado, Maruchi Fresno, Luis Prendes, and Jos√© B√≥dalo. This film was also categorized as being of national interest and is viewed as his first great popular and economic success. In 1950 he also co-directed Jack el negro [Black Jack] with Julien Duvivier. He reached the summit of his career as a film maker in 1951 with Surcos [Furrows] (1951). This film, which has a clear social inspiration from a Falangist perspective, is considered to be one of the great films of Spanish cinema. It has a script from Natividad Zaro and Gonzalo Torrente Ballester based on a plot by Eugenio Montes and features Luis Pe√±a and Mar√≠a Asquerino as its protagonists. The film caused controversy and was attacked by the Catholic Church for depicting taboo themes of the time, such as poverty, the black market, and rural migration, and as a result the ending of the film had to be changed before it could be screened. Additionally, despite winning national prizes it did not achieve commercial success. Filmography * Unknown Path (1946) * Anguish (1947) * Night Arrival (1949) * Black Jack (1950) a.k.a.

(December 15, 1909California, Prison and Correctional Records, 1851-1950 \\\\- ????), alias Slipton J. Fell,According to Bosworth, he also went by the aliases Ralph Sells and Charles Oliver. was a drifter convicted of murder in the death of Ada Brownell French Rice, the estranged wife of the mayor of Nome, Alaska. Labeled \\"The Laughing Killer\\" by the press, Selz continuously filed petitions for his release and made several successful escapes from prison only to be recaptured each time.  Early life  Selz was born in San Francisco, California, and after a long period of drifting, returned there in late 1935 and met Rice who, shortly thereafter, invited him to share a small cottage with her in Palo Alto, California. Selz was 30 years younger than Rice, but considered himself a Romeo of sorts and seemed to be a perfect match for her.  Crimes  On February 27, 1936 Selz was arrested on auto theft charges and police discovered he had been forging Ada Rice's signature and cashing checks on her account. Although Selz didn't know it, Rice had been reported missing. Police questioned him for weeks and he finally confessed to killing her and burying her body in the Santa Cruz mountains. Selz served more than 30 years in California prisons for the murder of Rice. He was known as \\"The Laughing Killer\\" because when he revealed the location of Mrs. Rice's grave in the Santa Cruz mountains he couldn't stop giggling. He later claimed that he had been abused by police interrogators and given \\"truth serum\\" medication during several days of intense interrogation, which caused him to laugh inappropriately. That claim was a basis of the court case People v. Von Braun Selz. Selz escaped from prison several times. The first time was about 1940. He had taught himself to speak five different languages while in prison. He fled to Canada and joined the Canadian Army under a phony name during the Second World War. Because of his language skills he was put in charge of a \\"displaced persons\\" camp in Quebec. These were European refugees from German occupied Europe. He interviewed many of these refugees and gained invaluable information about conditions in Europe. His information was very useful for Canadian and British military intelligence services. He received a number of decorations for his service and was written about in the Canadian press. This was his downfall. California prison authorities found out where he was hiding and he was arrested and extradited back to California to serve out his life sentence. However, the Canadian government was so grateful for his service that for many years afterward, whenever Selz would appear before the Parole Board, Canada would send a delegation to speak on his behalf and urge his release on parole. However, because Selz was suspected of being a serial killer and was suspected in the death of a total of five women, although he had only been convicted of the murder of his lover Mrs. Rice, he did not succeed in getting a parole until the late 1960s. He was returned to prison for violating his parole after a couple of years of freedom. He had attempted to get Social Security benefits using multiple Social Security numbers.Nash, Jay Robert, The Encyclopedia of World Crime, cited in Colin Wilson, The Murder Casebook, p. 201 Selz was paroled again about 1970 because of heart disease. His ultimate fate is unknown.

Career Rees was born in Cardiff, where he attended Fitzalan High School. During his time there, he was a member of the squad that was the first to take the English Schools' FA Cup out of England. He later joined his hometown club, Cardiff City, signing on a YTS scheme. He made his professional debut on 8 September 1984 in a 4‚Äì2 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion. Rees did not make another league appearance for the club until the following year when he was on the receiving end of eight defeats in nine appearances during the 1985‚Äì86 season. A wrist injury kept him sidelined for nearly a year and, on his return, the presence of Graham Moseley meant he was sold to First Division club Watford for a fee of ¬£60,000. At Watford, Rees spent three years as understudy to Tony Coton, as well as spending time on loan at Crewe Alexandra, Southampton and Leyton Orient, before leaving to join West Bromwich Albion after David James was named as Watford's first-choice goalkeeper following the departure of Coton. In March 1992, Rees joined Sheffield United for a fee of ¬£25,000 due to a goalkeeping crisis at the club, making his debut for the club in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Liverpool on 28 March 1992. He played in eight league games that season, helping them win five and draw two, which ensured their survival as they finished in a secure ninth place and confirmed their place in the new FA Premier League. When he made his First Division debut for Watford, on 28 December 1987 at the age of , Rees set a record for the youngest footballer to play in all four divisions of the English Football League. Illness and death Rees was diagnosed with cancer of the bowel in the summer of 1992. He underwent surgery in August of that year and was believed to have overcome the disease shortly afterwards. However, by March 1993 it had returned and he underwent further surgery. On 3 April 1993, Rees took a lap of honour prior to a FA Cup semi-final match between Sheffield United and their Steel City rivals Sheffield Wednesday after leading the two sides out. Former teammate Kevin Gage later recalled the moment, stating: Rees died at the end of the following month, aged 26. Legacy The 'Mel Rees Tournament' is held every summer at the Sheffield United academy to raise money for St Luke's Hospice.

She has written extensively on the juncture between Enlightenment moral philosophy, metaphysics, and politics, both for scholarly audiences and the general public. She currently lives in Germany, where she is the Director of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam. Biography and career Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Neiman dropped out of high school to join the anti-Vietnam War movement. Later she studied philosophy at Harvard University, earning her Ph.D. under the direction of John Rawls and Stanley Cavell. During graduate school, she spent several years of study at the Free University of Berlin. Slow Fire, a memoir about her life as a Jewish woman in 1980s Berlin, appeared in 1992. From 1989 to 1996 she was an assistant and associate professor of philosophy at Yale University, and from 1996 to 2000 she was an associate professor of philosophy at Tel Aviv University. In 2000 she assumed her current position at the Einstein Forum in Potsdam. She is the mother of three grown children. Neiman has been a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, a Research Fellow at the Rockefeller Foundation Study Center in Bellagio, and a Senior Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies. She is now a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Her books have won prizes from PEN, the Association of American Publishers, and the American Academy of Religion. Her shorter pieces have appeared in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Globe and Mail, and Dissent. In Germany, she has written for Die Zeit, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and Freitag, among other publications. Neiman belongs to a small number of women who have risen to public prominence in the male-dominated field of philosophy.\\"How can we end the male domination of philosophy?\\" https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/26/modern-philosophy-sexism- needs-more-womenWhat Is Philosophy's Problem With Women?: http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/09/09/philosophy_has_a_woman_problem_let_s_try_to_figure_out_why.html\\"In the Humanities, Men Dominate the Fields of Philosophy and History\\": http://chronicle.com/article/Men-Dominate-Philosophy-and/135306/ Major works Evil in Modern Thought Evil in Modern Thought writes the history of modern philosophy as a series of responses to the existence of evil ‚Äì that which, whether in the form of innocent suffering or human action intentionally causing it, ‚Äúthreatens our sense of the sense of the world.‚Äù Neiman argues that the problem of evil provides a better framework than epistemology for understanding the history of philosophy because it includes a wider range of texts, forms a link between metaphysics and ethics, and is more faithful to philosophers‚Äô stated concerns. Indeed, Neiman believes that evil, by challenging the intelligibility of the world as a whole, lies at the root of all philosophical inquiry. The book explores the period from the early Enlightenment to the late 20th century through discussions of philosophers who often figure in traditional histories of philosophy, such as Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer, as well ones who do not, such as Pierre Bayle, Sigmund Freud, Albert Camus, Emmanuel Levinas, and Hannah Arendt. Neiman groups thinkers around two basic distinctions: one between those who believe in a guiding order beyond appearances and those who think that sensory experience is all we have for orientation; and another between those who believe we must try to understand evil and those who maintain that doing so would be immoral on the grounds that any explanation of evil would be tantamount to its justification. Moral Clarity In Moral Clarity, Neiman argues that all human beings have moral needs but that secular culture, particularly on the political left, is reluctant or unable to satisfy them, and as a consequence has ceded the moral domain to religion and traditional conservatives. She attributes this failing not to a lack of values but to a lack of a ‚Äústandpoint from which those values make sense.‚Äù The book explores the reasons why this is so and offers a new framework for moral thinking based on Enlightenment ideas, particularly those of Kant and Rousseau, which rely neither on divine authority nor on authoritarian ideology. Why Grow Up? In Why Grow Up, Neiman challenges the infantilism that she believes is widespread in modern society. She suggests that the ‚Äúforces that shape our world‚Äù encourage consumerism, apathy, cynicism, and the fetishization of beauty and youth in order to keep citizens passive and compliant. These, she thinks, are propped up by a conception of adulthood in which being an adult is synonymous with drudgery, resignation, and inevitable decline. Neiman makes the case for an ideal of adulthood that involves exercising judgement, understanding one‚Äôs own culture through immersion in others, actively shaping society, and seeking orientation in the face of uncertainty. As in Moral Clarity, Neiman draws on the work of Kant, Rousseau, Arendt, and other philosophers to argue for a concept of maturity in which thinking critically does not mean abandoning one‚Äôs ideals. Learning from the Germans Learning from the Germans examines German efforts to atone for Nazi atrocities and identifies lessons for how the United States might come to terms with its legacy of slavery and racism. The book brings together historical and philosophical analysis; interviews with politicians, activists, and contemporary witnesses in Germany and the United States; and Neiman‚Äôs own first-person observations as a white woman growing up in the South and a Jewish woman who has lived for almost three decades in Berlin. Awards and honors In 2014 Neiman was the recipient of the International Spinoza Prize and an honorary doctorate from the University of Sankt Gallen. She delivered the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at the University of Michigan in 2010.

Fossil remains (which are common in the pellets of the extinct laughing owl) indicate the species was once widespread across both the North Island and the South Island. Despite a small number of reports of small owls being found in the 19th century that may have been New Zealand owlet-nightjars, the species is thought to have become extinct around 1200 AD. The New Zealand owlet-nightjar was the largest species of owlet- nightjar, weighing an estimated 150‚Äì200 g. The species was also either flightless, as suggested by its small wings, or a very poor flier (the species has a strong keel). The diet probably consisted of invertebrates, as well as frogs and lizards. The species rapidly became extinct after the introduction of Pacific rats to New Zealand. Their remains have never been found in association with MƒÅori middens, and are unlikely to have been hunted due to their small size and nocturnal habits.

The Botanical Garden has two separate sites: one in Kaisaniemi and one in Kumpula. The Kaisaniemi Garden is open to the public. Its greenhouse is currently home to more than 800 different species of plants and its grounds to more than 2,800 plants of different origins. Construction on the Kumpula Garden started in 1987 and opened to the public in 2009. History of the Kaisaniemi Garden =A walking area for the people of Helsinki= In 1763, Governor Hans Henrik B√∂je rented a plot of land from the city of Helsinki bordered by H√§meen maantie (nowadays Siltasaarenkatu) and started a garden on it. In 1773, control of the garden was handed over to gardener Erik Edbom. When Helsinki became the capital in 1812, the garden became a municipal garden. Later on, in 1827, work on transforming the garden into a walking area for the denizens of Helsinki commenced according to plans drawn up by Carl Ludvig Engel. His plans divided the park into two distinct areas: a symmetrical, tree-lined park and a landscaped garden formed by winding paths. In 1829, the walking area was pared back once the Imperial Academy of Turku Botanical Garden moved next to it after the Great Fire hit Turku and the Imperial Academy relocated to Helsinki. =History of the Botanical Garden= The Palm House, built in 1889 The University of Helsinki Botanical Garden has its roots in the Imperial Academy of Turku Botanical Garden, which was established by Professor Elias Tillandz in 1678. Tillandz‚Äô garden was a small garden for growing cabbages and medicinal plants. After Tillandz‚Äô death, the garden was left to its own demise until Professor Pehr Kalm took responsibility for it. The garden started to flourish as Kalm brought hundreds of useful plants with him from North America. When the Imperial Academy of Turku relocated to Helsinki in 1828, it was allocated a piece of land in Kaisaniemi that had previously served as common pasture for the people of Helsinki. Professor of Zoology and Botany Carl Reinhold Sahlberg started construction on a new garden, relying on his extensive private collection that was not destroyed in the Great Fire of Turku. Head Gardener Franz Faldermann of the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden was commissioned to design the botanical garden. According to his plan, the garden had two separate areas: gardens and a park-like arboretum. He also planned the greenhouse buildings, of which the first was completed in 1832. Sahlberg served as the first head and organizer of the botanical garden, whose ambitious goal was to create collections of all of the plants in Finland and as many of the non-Finnish plants that thrived in Finland. The wooden, single- storey main building designed by Engel was built in the middle of the garden by 1831. In the 1850s, it was expanded according to plans by . The wood building was moved out of the way of the new main building. In its new location, it became the gardeners‚Äô living quarters, which is the purpose it still serves today. Wiik planned an Empire style bakehouse for the garden and a fence to protect the garden from the cows grazing in pasture nearby. Engel also planned a joint Gothic stable and cow barn, which has already been demolished. The botanical garden's current buildings are the handiwork of Architect Gustaf Nystr√∂m, as the original greenhouses designed by Faldermann were replaced at the end of the 19th century with new greenhouses designed by Nystr√∂m. Unlike Faldermann's greenhouses, Nystr√∂m's were made of wrought iron. In 1889, the large, tropical Palm House with its glass roof was finished and in 1896 the rest of the greenhouses. In 1903, construction on the institute building housing the Botanical Department and the Botanical Museum that Nystr√∂m had designed to replace the original main building now serving as the gardeners‚Äô living quarters and the professor's living quarters was finished. The Botanical Museum is still housed in the same building. The gardeners‚Äô building was relocated to the western border of the botanical garden. Furthermore, wooden buildings from the 19th century were moved to the northern border of the garden from elsewhere in Helsinki during the 1990s. During the Continuation War, the garden was hit by three bombs and the greenhouses were damaged. As a result, all of the more than 1,500 taxa in the greenhouses, with the exception of a single cypress and the seeds of a water-lily, died due to freezing temperatures. The seeds survived at the bottom of the water-lily pool and the current water-lily in the pool is the descendant of that water-lily. In the 1950s, the greenhouses were restored and modernized and from 1996 to 1998, they were refurbished once again. The Kaisaniemi Garden and its greenhouses will continue to be used for exhibitions and research. History of the Kumpula Garden The useful plant section of the Kumpula Garden on September 9, 2006 In the 20th century, the university's botanical garden started to run out of space, so when the decision was made to split the university into four separate campus areas in the 1970s, a plot of land for a new botanical garden was set aside on the Kumpula Campus. The boundaries of the Kumpula Garden were drawn in 1987. The new garden was built in the former garden of the Kumpula Manor. It opened to public in 2009. The garden is divided up into two separate sections: one for useful plants and one where the plants are arranged according to their geographical origin. The plants are gathered from areas that have climates similar to that of southern Finland, e.g., from Europe, North America and the Far East.

It offers telephone, internet, and television services through FTTH in 45 cities of Mexico as well as IT Services. It is the second largest landline telephone service provider and a relevant virtual private network operator. History Though incorporated in 1993, it wasn't until 1997 that AXTEL received authorizations from the Mexican government to operate in the radioelectrical spectrum. The company's business plan was to compete with Telmex in local telephony by bypassing phone lines and using fixed wireless communications instead, one of the largest deployments thereof in the world. It wasn't until 1999 that the company began operating in Monterrey. It later expanded to Guadalajara, and Mexico City in 2000. Then President Ernesto Zedillo made the first \\"national\\" call in the company's network, inaugurating service nationwide. At the time, news outlets around the country saw this moment as the beginning of a true open market in the local telephony business in Mexico. On December 4, 2006, Axtel acquired Avantel Infraestructura and Avantel, S. de R.L. de C.V. (collectively Avantel). Avantel was a provider of Internet protocol (IP) solutions. Avantel provided telecommunications services to business, government and residential customers in Mexico. Avantel was incorporated as a 55.5%-44.5% joint-venture between Banamex and MCI, primarily oriented to provide long-distance services. Avantel brought to Axtel spectrum in various frequencies, approximately 390 kilometers of metropolitan fiber optic rings, 7,700 kilometers of long- distance fiber optic network, an IP backbone and connectivity in 200 cities in Mexico, among others. By 2007, Axtel had expanded its coverage to 20 of the most important cities in the nation. It was in this year that the company made its initial public offering in the Mexican Stock Exchange. AXTEL provides services using a hybrid wireline and fixed wireless local access network (including 1,079.8 kilometers of metro fiber optic rings) along with 7,700 kilometers of long-haul fiber-optic network. The Company's nationwide network includes 7,700 kilometers of fiber optic network with links to terminate long- distance traffic in over 200 cities.

Oregon Ducks Football: 100 Years of Glory. Eugene, OR: McCann Communications Corp. . for five seasons, 1967 through 1971, compiling a record of 22‚Äì29‚Äì2. At Oregon, Frei coached Dan Fouts and Ahmad RashƒÅd. He later worked in the National Football League (NFL) as an assistant coach and scout, mostly with the Denver Broncos. Early years Frei spent his early years in the village of Brooklyn, then moved with his family to Stoughton, southeast of Madison. Frei graduated from Stoughton High School in 1941, shortly before his 17th birthday, and was a classmate of Marian Benson, whom he married in 1945. He was inducted into the Stoughton Hall of Fame after his death. =Wisconsin Badgers= Frei played college football at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and was a guard for the Badgers as a sophomore in 1942. The team starred two-time All American end Dave Schreiner and halfback Elroy \\"Crazylegs\\" Hirsch, finished with an 8‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, ranked third in the final AP Poll, and was named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation. The Badgers beat the AP national champion, Ohio State, 17‚Äì7, but lost to unheralded Iowa, 6‚Äì0 and tied Notre Dame, 7‚Äì7. That glorious Badger season was played in a final-fling atmosphere on campus with many students, including football players, already enlisted in the service and awaiting their callups to active duty during World War II. Only one player from that Badgers team still was on the Wisconsin roster in 1943. Frei was only age 18, but like most of his teammates, he went on active duty in early 1943. =World War II= Frei served as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces, after training flying 67 reconnaissance missions in the Pacific theater for the 26th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (26th PRS) of the Fifth Air Force's 6th Photographic Group. In the unarmed version of the P-38, he made solo or tandem flights over Japanese targets to take photographs in advance of bombing missions. He was awarded the Air Medal with two Oak Leaf clusters, meaning he in essence earned the medal three times. Two starters (Schreiner and tackle Bob Baumann) were killed in action on Okinawa and the Badgers compiled a stunning collection of military honors in various service branches and around the world. =Return to Wisconsin= After the war, Frei returned to Wisconsin, where he played football for the Badgers in 1946 and 1947, and graduated in 1948. Coaching career =Early coaching positions= Journeying to Oregon at the recommendation of a fellow pilot, Don Garbarino, Frei quickly became a popular high school football coach at Grant High School in Portland.Bellamy, Ron. \\"This Picture's Worth Goes Beyond Words\\", The Register-Guard, 22 October 2004 He was an assistant to Ted Ogdahl, who himself earned a Silver Star for wartime service in the Pacific fighting, as the Generals‚Äîwith future Oregon Duck and NFL quarterback George Shaw starring‚Äîwon the Oregon state championship in 1949. Frei became head coach at Lincoln High School in 1950, then line coach at Willamette University in Salem in 1952. =Oregon= Frei joined the popular, respected, and successful Len Casanova's football staff at the University of Oregon in Eugene as freshman coach in 1955 and became offensive line coach the next year. When Casanova became athletic director, Frei was named UO's 25th head coach in January 1967, the first year at the new Autzen Stadium, north of campus. The previous venue, Hayward Field, was a track and field shrine, but woefully inadequate and a recruiting handicap for football in Casanova's final seasons. Recovering from a 2-8 start in 1967, Frei's teams had a 22‚Äì29‚Äì2 record for his five seasons as head coach. His 1970 team defeated both UCLA and USC, plus then-unbeaten and highly-ranked Air Force late in the season, and finished in a tie for second in the Pacific-8 Conference in an era when only the league champion (Stanford in 1970) went to a bowl game (through 1974), the Rose Bowl. Frei was named UPI's national coach of the week twice that season, following the wins over USC and Air Force. Frei himself was known to be conservative, but his philosophy was that especially because he had flown in combat when younger than many of his players and had been forced to grow up fast; he wasn't going to try to control his young players' lives, dictate their hairstyles, or attempt to censor their political views away from the field. He steadfastly refused to call his players \\"kids,\\" and some made fun of or never understood his unvarying references to them as \\"young men.\\" His positive impact on his players during turbulent times was long-lasting. In a pattern that would continue for most of his NFL coaching and administrative career, his official Oregon coaching biography published in media guides and programs made no mention of his military service during World War II and made no attempt to explain the four- year gap between his sophomore and junior seasons as a Wisconsin player. He never brought it up and most of his players were astounded to hear about it later‚Äîmuch later. Frei was on the staff at Oregon for 17 seasons, twelve as an assistant and five as head coach. Resignation Frei resigned as head coach on January 19, 1972. That was two months after the end of the 1971 season, which included road losses to national champion Nebraska and national power Texas in \\"paycheck\\" games deemed necessary for the then-strapped Oregon athletic department. The final game was a 30‚Äì29 home loss to Oregon State in the Civil War, with halfback Rashad (then known as Bobby Moore) unable to play because a bruised thigh. It was Oregon State's eighth consecutive win in the series. Frei, popular in Eugene, had seemed destined to remain as coach, but his resignation followed a dispute with second-year athletic director Norv Ritchey, who recommended that Frei fire assistant coaches to deflect criticism and mollify some disgruntled boosters, primarily in Portland.George Seifert article The ridiculousness of that request would become clear later. His final Oregon staff included future NFL head coaches John Robinson, George Seifert, and Gunther Cunningham, future NFL defensive coordinator John Marshall, and Bruce Snyder, a future head coach at Utah State, California, and Arizona State. Radical student body president Iain Moore issued a statement to the Oregon media, declaring: \\"In an un-ideal situation, Jerry Frei ran as ideal a program as possible with the broad interests of the participants pre-eminent in his mind and actions. The Oregon program will be all the poorer for his departure and his reputation has been besmirched in the process.\\"\\"Third Down and a War to Go.\\" =National Football League= Frei was an assistant coach with the Broncos (1972‚Äì1975), expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1976‚Äì1977), and Chicago Bears (1978‚Äì1980), returning to the Broncos in 1981. He was a Broncos offensive line coach under John Ralston and Dan Reeves before going into scouting and administration, and he wound down his full-time career as the team's director of college scouting. After his retirement, Frei served as a consultant until his death at age 76 in 2001. Family Frei's widow, Marian, died at age 87, in Lakewood, Colorado, in March 2011. They are buried at Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver. Frei's sons are David Frei, host of The National Dog Show Presented by Purina, former host of The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and AKC-licensed judge;https://www.nbc.com/the-national-dog- show/credits/host/david- freihttps://www.oregonlive.com/tv/2018/11/david_frei_on_cohosting_the_na.html and journalist Terry Frei, whose seven books include \\"Third Down and a War to Go ,\\" about the heroic 1942 Wisconsin Badgers.

Both men are widely credited as acting head coaches in official histories of the \\"Fighting Irish\\" football team, and Salmon is recognized as head coach during the 1903‚Äì1904 season. Playing career Born in Syracuse, New York, Salmon made his mark in collegiate football in 1903, when (as a senior) he scored 105 points. His career record of 36 touchdowns remained a school standard until 1985. At six feet and three inches, and 230 pounds, Salmon was a force to be reckoned with on the gridiron. As one writer observed: \\"The alabaster-skinned Salmon has been described as both a slasher and a smasher, a colorful way of saying he would run right over you if he could not run around you\\". Moreover, in an era when a wet pigskin might weigh as much as 14 pounds, Salmon averaged 30 yards with his punts. In 1903, Salmon was named to Walter Camp's third All-America team. Coaching career and legacy During the 1903‚Äì1904 season, Salmon served officially as head coach of the \\"Fighting Irish\\". He presided over a lackluster season of 5‚Äì4, and as one writer has commented, \\"The team needed Salmon on the field, not on the sidelines\\". After graduating with a degree in engineering, the former sports hero rarely returned to campus and underplayed his outstanding athletic career.

Located in Tombstone, the park preserves the original Cochise County courthouse. The two-story building, constructed in 1882 in the Victorian style, is laid out in the shape of a cross and once contained various county offices, including those of the sheriff, recorder, treasurer, and the Board of Supervisors as well as courtrooms and a jail.Arizona State Parks: Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park Inside, the courthouse contains a museum with numerous artifacts from the town's history while outside, a replica gallows has been constructed in the courtyard to mark the spot where seven men were hanged for various crimes. The park was one of the first to be designated as a state park and in 1959 was the first to open following the 1957 establishment of the Arizona State Parks Board. History Following the 1877 discovery of silver ore by prospector Ed Schieffelin in southeastern Arizona, the town of Tombstone was founded and grew rapidly as miners flooded the area in the hope of finding their fortunes. The town of Tombstone was incorporated in 1879. By 1881 the town had grown to more than 7,000 population; stage robberies were no longer novel events. But more important than the lawlessness, Tombstone miners and merchants had to travel 150 dusty roundtrip miles to Tucson to record mining claims, deeds, contracts, etc. at the Pima County Courthouse. At the time, the area was part of Pima County with the county seat Tucson being a rugged two-day, 70-mile journey away. In 1881, as a result of these incentives, and aided by a shrewd agreement with the Prescott delegation to the Territorial Legislature, the residents of the thriving boomtown voted to separate from Pima County and the territorial legislature subsequently formed a new county, Cochise County. Cochise county was formed in 1881 from the eastern part of Pima County, and Tombstone became its seat (The Territorial Capital stayed at Prescott rather than moving to Tucson). A new courthouse was built the following year and housed all of the county's offices. The Sheriff of Cochise County had his office on the ground floor, first door to the right, when the new courthouse was built in 1882. Sheriff John Behan and his successors gradually instilled the idea that the proper arena for conflict was the courtroom upstairs rather than the street. Except for the Earp - Clanton feud, which gave Tombstone an extremely bad press from which it has no interest in recovering, citizens gladly accepted the proffered alternative. The Tombstone courthouse represents a practical solution to the problem of securing lives and property in unorganized or poorly governed territory. It was put into effect quickly, without fumbling by men practiced in the process through their experience in Colorado, Utah, Nevada, where mining rushes had carried them in the past. Tombstone remained the county seat until 1929, when outvoted by a growing Bisbee, and the county seat was moved there. The last county office left the courthouse in 1931. Except for an ill-fated attempt to convert the courthouse into a hotel during the 1940s, the building stood vacant until 1955. When the Tombstone Restoration Commission acquired it, they began the courthouse rehabilitation and the development as a historical museum that has continued to operate as a state park since 1959. It features exhibits and thousands of artifacts which tell of Tombstone's colorful past. Architecture The courthouse in Tombstone is an elegant example of Territorial Victorian. The building is a well-integrated, stylish, yet sober and restrained culmination of that tradition When Maricopa County built its courthouse a few years later, they cribbed liberally from Tombstone's example. The Tombstone courthouse is the oldest courthouse still standing in Arizona, At the time it was built it was one of the largest buildings in Arizona Territory. The building measures 76 feet in total width; the \\"shaft\\" of the cruciform structure measures 40 feet wide; the east and west wings project nineteen feet from the main structure and are 30 feet long. The first segment to be built is 88 feet long overall. The addition to the jail and courtroom brought the total to 116 feet in length. The building is a two-story red brick structure built with five courses of runners and one of headers. Exterior angles are quoined with white stone and/white stone \\"dripstone course\\" separates the lower and upper half of the building. A one-story cupola or observation tower with a mansard roof wears a lacy gingerbread cresting that creates a kind of \\"widow's walk\\" atop all. Fenestration is symmetrical. The double-hung eight-pane windows, are set in heavy frames topped by a bracketed, heavy \\"territorial\\" cornice that echoes the strongly accented pediments atop each end wall of the building. The eave- line is deeply recessed and strongly accented with simple dentils as are the pediments of the gable ends. This theme is repeated on a smaller scale on the cupola pediments. Elegantly slim chimneys once served every room but are now reduced to two. An iron spiral stair ascends the southeast corner to the courtroom. Formerly another arose from the jail below the courtroom directly to the prisoner's table. It replaced an elevator which proved unsatisfactory. The front entrance porch is carried by four square pillars, two free and two attached, all have a large groove on each face. It is topped by a balustrade. The porch cornice is dentated. The main portion of the Tombstone Courthouse was built in 1882 at a cost of $50,000. An addition to the rear was built in 1904. The building served as Cochise County courthouse until 1929 when the county seat was moved to Bisbee. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

The conflict was part of the Jin-Song wars, and was fought near Tangdao Island. It was an attempt by the Jin to invade and conquer the Southern Song Dynasty, yet resulted in failure and defeat for the Jurchens. The Jin Dynasty navy was set on fire by firearms and Fire Arrows, suffering heavy losses. For this battle, the commander of the Song Dynasty squadron, Li Bao, faced the opposing commander Zheng Jia, the admiral of the Jin Dynasty. On the fate of Zheng Jia, the historical text of the Jin Shi states: This battle was followed by another naval confrontation, the Battle of Caishi (ÈááÁü≥‰πãÊàò) taking place in 1161. The battle is significant in the technological history of the Song navy. The 20th-century historian Joseph Needham has called the era \\"one of continual innovation\\" when the size of the Song fleet grew \\"from a total of 11 squadrons and 3,000 men [the Song navy] rose in one century to 20 squadrons totalling 52,000 men, with its main base near Shanghai.\\" They were further reinforced by the aid of seafaring Chinese merchants. The technological gains of the Song navy ensured its access and dominance of the East China Sea for centuries in competition with the military forces of Jurchen and Mongol rivals. By 1129, the Song navy had invented gunpowder bombs for warship trebuchets. The weapon was made mandatory for all ships in the Song fleet. The construction of paddle-wheel ships, operated with treadmills, went on for several decades between 1132 and 1183. The engineer Gao Xuan devised a paddle-wheel ship outfitted with up to eleven paddle-wheels on each side. Iron plating for armoring the ships was designed in 1203 by the engineer Qin Shifu.

It was also included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two (1973) after being voted one of the best novellas up to 1965.\\"Introduction\\", Ben Bova, The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two, New York: Doubleday, 1973, pp. ix‚Äìxi. Identical in volumes Two A and Two B. Plot summary The story is about the conversion of an ordinary house into an interplanetary portal or stargate by mysterious alien beings who apparently have taken up the task of exploring space for habitable planets and connecting them to each other, thus allowing civilizations to swap ideas easily. In the story, a tinkerer and trader, Hiram Taine, finds out that his house contains peculiar creatures who repair and upgrade things in interesting ways and transform parts of his house to a substance impervious to harm. After unearthing a spaceship buried in the backyard, he discovers that the front part of his house is no longer on Earth but on a strange desert planet which is now accessible by merely passing through the front door. A little exploration in the desert reveals the existence of another similar house which opens to a rainy planet and some spaceships identical to the one unearthed in the backyard sitting in launch cradles next to some other empty launch cradles, implying several other similar houses. The story ends with the arrival of some aliens of either the desert planet or one of those connected to it, who are eager to trade ideas with the new member of the universal \\"planet-network\\". Publication history Since its original publication in Astounding Science Fiction, \\"The Big Front Yard\\" has not been re-published in any other magazine. In particular, it was never published in the British version of Astounding. The story has been anthologized at least ten times, including Italian and German translations. The story also appears in at least seven collections devoted to Simak's work, including French and German translations (for the latter, the story was titled \\"Das Tor zur anderen Welt\\" (\\"The Gateway to the Other World\\")).

Ryman worked in watercolor, oils, and pen & ink sketches. In 1953 Ryman drew the first illustrations of Walt Disney's vision of a theme park that eventually became Disneyland. Early years and education Ryman was born in Vernon, Illinois, son of Dr. Herbert D. Ryman (1878-1918) and Cora Belle Ryman ( Norris, 1876-1963). His family moved to Decatur, IL when he was age 9. While attending Millikin University, he became deathly ill with scarlet fever. His mother was opposed to his artistic ambitions and wanted him to pursue a medical degree. But as his sickness worsened, she told him that he could attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He graduated cum laude in 1932 from the Art Institute of Chicago. Career In 1932 Ryman moved to California, where he found a job as a storyboard illustrator in the art department of Cedric Gibbons at Metro-Golden-Mayer Studios. For a period, during Hollywood's \\"golden age\\", he was the sole artist and illustrator for MGM Studios. He helped design many major pictures for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and 20th Century Fox including the screen styling of David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities, Mutiny on the Bounty, and Anna Karenina. His work on The Good Earth project inspired him to leave his job at MGM and tour China where he made many sketches. His last work at MGM was the Emerald City segment of The Wizard of Oz. In 1938 he returned to California, where he met Walt Disney as a result of an exhibit of Ryman's works at the Chouinard Art Institute. Walt was so impressed with the paintings that he invited Herb to join the Walt Disney Studios (Burbank). Herb went on to serve as an art director for such feature- length animated films as Fantasia and Dumbo. In the late summer of 1941, Ryman toured with Walt Disney, other Disney Studio artists, and management personnel on a three-month \\"Good Will Tour of South America\\", through an invitation from Nelson Rockefeller, Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The tour was part of an Allied effort to maintain solid relations with southern countries in the Western Hemisphere. They traveled by aircraft and regional railway systems connecting the countries of Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, and Mexico. Production of the two Disney films Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros, resulted from this trip.\\"Walt Disney's Railroad Story: The Small-Scale Fascination That Let to a Full-Scale Kingdom\\". Michael Broggie, 1998, pg. 205-214. Ryman had become acquainted with author Margaret Landon during his travels in Asia. After the end of World War II, when he heard that 20th Century Fox was developing a film based on Landon's 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam, he informed Disney that he was leaving Walt Disney Productions to work on the 20th Century Fox film. At Fox, Ryman also worked on several other pictures, including Forever Amber, Down to the Sea in Ships, David and Bathsheba, The Black Rose, and The Robe. During the summers of 1949 and 1951, Ryman took a leave of absence from 20th Century Fox and travelled with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Living among the performers and documenting the circus in his paintings, he became friends with Emmett Kelly. In 1955 Doubleday published The Tontine, a two volume novel written by Thomas B. Costain and illustrated by Ryman. Set in nineteenth- century England, the story centers around the fictional \\"Waterloo\\" tontine, established to benefit veterans of the Napoleonic wars. Among other plot twists, shareholders hire an actor to impersonate a dead nominee, and conspire to murder another member. After leaving the Disney organization, Ryman had remained friends with Walt Disney. On September 26, 1953 he received an urgent request to meet with Disney. Disney asked Ryman to render the artwork for a Disney envisioned theme park. Disney and Ryman worked non-stop throughout the weekend creating a large pencil sketch and several other drawings illustrating the project.Chronology of Disneyland Theme Park Roy Disney took the drawings and a six-page portfolio to New York to show investors the plan in order to secure financing used to develop Disneyland. Once financing was assured, Disney asked Ryman to rejoin the Disney Company. Disneyland became the centerpiece of his Disney career. Among his contributions were designs for Main Street, U.S.A., Sleeping Beauty Castle and New Orleans Square. Herb also contributed concepts for the Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, and for attractions featured at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair, including Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. Ryman worked on many special projects at Disney over a five decade span. He was the chief designer of the Cinderella Castle at the Walt Disney World Resort. Ryman officially retired from The Walt Disney Company in 1971. He returned in 1976 as a consultant on Walt Disney World, Epcot Center including renderings and concept paintings for The American Adventure, the China Pavilion, and the Meet the World attraction at Tomorrow Land at Tokyo Disneyland. His last project at Disney was contributing concept drawings for Main Street in the planned Euro Disneyland when he became ill. He is well known for his watercolors of the rugged California coasts around Carmel and Point Lobos, as well as for his paintings of the Ringling Brothers Circus, and portraits of Emmett Kelly and other well known people. Many of his paintings hang in Hollywood's most famed homes. Awards and legacy Ryman was a member of the American Institute of Fine Arts, the Society of Illustrators, and the California Art Club where he was president in 1963. In 1990, Herb Ryman was inducted [posthumously] into the Disney Legends program. His sister, Lucille Carroll, co-founded the Ryman-Carroll Foundation in his memory. In 2000 the Ryman-Carroll Foundation published \\"A Brush with Disney\\" a 252-page story of Ryman's life with color illustrations by Ryman (). Personal life Ryman's ancestors came to the U.S. from Heidelberg, Germany. Ryman's father, Dr. Herbert D. Ryman was born April 11, 1878 in Vernon, Illinois. He graduated from Kansas State Medical College, Lawrence, KS in 1907. He moved his family to Mt. Pulaski, Illinois in 1910. The U.S. entered World War I in April 1917 and Dr. Ryman joined the Army Medical Reserve Corps the following September. He was commissioned a Captain in the Medical Corps 107th Field Artillery 28th Division and sent to the war front in France at his request. On Saturday afternoon, August 17, 1918 he was mortally wounded while ministering to a wounded comrade on the battlefield near St. Gilles, France. Refusing aid, he assisted in rendering and directing the treatment of three other soldiers. Though weakened by loss of blood, he showed utter disregard for his personal danger, refusing to accept treatment until the other wounded had been cared for. He later died at a nearby aid station. For his act of heroism he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His mother, Cora Belle Norris, was born July 6, 1876, in Pendleton County, Kentucky and was the great-granddaughter of President Zachary Taylor. After the death of her husband, Mrs. Ryman moved Herbert and his two sisters Lucille and Christine to Decatur, where she resumed her teaching career. She later was elected superintendent of the Macon County Schools, where she served for 16 years. She retired in 1938 and moved to California to live with her son, Herbert. She died in Los Angeles, California, on January 9, 1963, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Ryman lived for many years on Chandler Blvd in Van Nuys, California. He later moved to Sherman Oaks, California, where he died of cancer on February 10, 1989., 16 days after the death of his oldest sister Christine Pensinger (1903-1989).

Life and career Great-nephew of the theologian Samuel Hopkins, Mark Hopkins was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1824 from Williams College, where he was a tutor in 1825‚Äì1827, and where in 1830, after having graduated in the previous year from the Berkshire Medical College at Pittsfield, he became professor of Moral Philosophy and Rhetoric. In 1833 he was licensed to preach in Congregational churches. He was president of Williams College from 1836 until 1872. He was one of the ablest and most successful of the old type of college president. He married Mary Hubbell in 1832 and together they parented ten children. His volume of lectures on Evidences of Christianity (1846) was delivered as a series of lectures at the Lowell Institute in January 1844. The book became a favorite textbook in American Christian apologetics being reprinted in many editions up until 1909. Although not trained as a lawyer Hopkins held a lifelong interest in the law and aspects of his argument in Evidences of Christianity reflects legal metaphors and language about the veracity of eyewitness testimony to the events in the life of Jesus Christ. Much of his apologetic arguments though were a restatement of views that had been previously presented by earlier apologists such as William Paley and Thomas Hartwell Horne. In Hall of Fame for Great Americans Of his other writings, the chief were Lectures on Moral Science (1862), The Law of Love and Love as a Law (1869), An Outline Study of Man (1873), The Scriptural Idea of Man (1883), and Teachings and Counsels (1884). Dr Hopkins took a lifelong interest in Christian missions, and from 1857 until his death was president of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (the foreign missions board for American Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and other Reformed Protestant churches.). He died at Williamstown, on 17 June 1887. Reputation President James Garfield had attended Williams College in the 1850s. At an 1871 dinner of Williams alumni, Garfield paid tribute to Hopkins, defining an ideal college as Hopkins and a student together in a log cabin. The epigram became more widely known in the pithier form retold by John James Ingalls, in which a log was substituted for the log cabin. In the later judgment of university historian Frederick Rudolph, \\"no one can properly address himself to the question of higher education in the United States without paying homage in some way to the aphorism of the log and to Mark Hopkins\\". In his 1903 essay \\"The Talented Tenth,\\" W. E. B. Du Bois opined, \\"There was a time when the American people believed pretty devoutly that a log of wood with a boy at one end and Mark Hopkins at the other, represented the highest ideal of human training. But in these eager days it would seem that we have changed all that and think it necessary to add a couple of saw-mills and a hammer to this outfit, and, at a pinch, to dispense with the services of Mark Hopkins.\\" In 1915 Hopkins was elected into the American Hall of Fame. Family His son, Henry Hopkins (1837‚Äì1908), was also a president of Williams College. Mark Hopkins's brother, Albert Hopkins (1807‚Äì1872), was long associated with him at Williams College, where he graduated in 1826 and was successively a tutor (1827‚Äì1829), professor of mathematics and natural philosophy (1829‚Äì1838), professor of natural philosophy and astronomy (1838‚Äì1868) and professor of astronomy (1868‚Äì1872). In 1835 he organized and conducted a natural history expedition to Joggins, Nova Scotia, said to have been the first expedition of the kind sent out from any American college, and in 1837, at his suggestion and under his direction, an astronomical observatory was built at Williams College, said to have been the first in the United States built at a college exclusively for the purposes of instruction.

Early life Garnett Lucille Ryman was born to Dr. Herbert D. Ryman and Cora Belle (Norris) Ryman while her father was a medical student at Kansas State Medical College. Dr. Ryman died in France while a field surgeon during World War I when she was about twelve, and her mother Cora Belle, a schoolteacher, raised the children. Lucille, as she was known, graduated from Decatur High School in Decatur, Illinois and went on to Millikin University, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority and acted in plays. During the following five years, she taught at Assumption High School and Roosevelt Junior High, acting in plays staged by Decatur's Town and Gown Players, a community theater company. Moving to California to study acting at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1931, she won a $1,000 scholarship. She quit her teaching job in Decatur to act in and direct plays at the playhouse, where movie actors graced the stage and directors sought new talent. Lucille's brother, Herbert Ryman (1910-1989) was a prominent Walt Disney Company imagineer. Career Using the stage name Jane Starr, she worked with movie producer Louis O. Macloon at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, demonstrating how motion pictures were made. Macloon, who had recently given an actor named Clark Gable some of his first parts, chose her to star in the Broadway play It Pays to Sin. When the play received scathing reviews and closed, Carroll sought consolation by visiting backstage with Katharine Hepburn, who had also received terrible reviews while acting in a nearby theater. Hepburn was characteristically blunt. \\"Then you're not an actress\\", Hepburn told Carroll. \\"I don't care what the critics say about me. I know what I am.\\" Carroll moved to San Francisco, where she and Macloon opened an experimental theater and produced several plays. She married Macloon in 1936. They divorced within a few years. During the 1930s, she traveled throughout the nation as talent scout for Universal Pictures, rising to become head of that studio's talent department in New York. Carroll headed Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer's talent department from 1941 to 1954 and helped sign a young actress named Lana Turner, helped arrange a key screen test for Marilyn Monroe and played a role in bringing June Allyson and Janet Leigh to MGM. She was one of the first women to reach a position of executive power in the old Hollywood studio system. At MGM, she met John Carroll, a successful actor who had appeared in movies such as Flying Tigers with John Wayne and Go West with the Marx Brothers. They were married in 1947. He died in 1979. Movies made at MGM while Lucille Carroll ran its training department included Singin' in the Rain, Show Boat, Gaslight and Meet Me in St. Louis. While she was there, MGM garnered 16 Academy Award nominations for best picture, winning Oscars for An American in Paris and Mrs. Miniver. In 1942, Hepburn signed a contract with MGM to appear in a picture, Woman of the Year, the first of many in which she appeared with Spencer Tracy. One of Carroll's roles at MGM was as an advisor to established stars such as Hepburn, Tracy, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Greer Garson. She smoothed over differences that arose between the stars and the studio's business executives. In later years, Carroll resided in Burbank with her brother. After Herb's death, she produced a collection of his great works and many Disney conceptual works, that later became reality, as the hallmark of the Disney Theme Parks. She also co-founded the Ryman-Carroll Foundation as a tribute to her brother and to honor his lifelong dedication to mentoring young artists. She died in her Glendale home at the age of 96 on October 23, 2002.

His first name was a Welsh form of \\"Edwin\\"; his second a grandmother's surname.The Encyclopaedia of Boys' School Stories, Robert J. Kirkpatrick, Ashgate, 2000, p. 59 Brooks published his first short story, \\"Mr Dorien's Missing ¬£2000\\", in July 1907, when he was seventeen. His first major breakthrough came in 1910, when the paper The Gem gave him an assignment to publish a serial named \\"The Iron Island\\", the main character being Frank Kingston. In 1912 he wrote his first Sexton Blake stories and in 1915 started writing stories for the Nelson Lee Library, becoming the lead writer of the detective series after which the publication was named. In 1917 he started the St. Frank's series in that paper, the stories for which he is best remembered. Additional serial assignments followed, including those featuring Clive Derring and Sexton Blake. In 1918 he launched the character of Rupert Waldo, an early superhero. In 1918 he married Frances (daughter of master tailor Abraham Goldstein),http://www.edwysearlesbrooks.com/biography.html who became his assistant and collaborator through the years. The two took great pride in delivering clean manuscripts for publication throughout their careers. They became a cornerstone of the Amalgamated Press imprints. Their son, Lionel (1928‚Äì), wrote Conquest Calls The Tune (1968) with his mother, and 1969's Conquest in Ireland alone.http://www.edwysearlesbrooks.com/biography.htmlhttp://www.booksandwriters.co.uk/B/edwy- searles-brooks.html The magazines that had published his stories started running into financial trouble in the 1930s, and Brooks started publishing hardcover novels for the adult market in 1938 with the first novel in the Norman Conquest series under the pseudonym of Berkeley Gray. He also published stories and novels as Victor Gunn featuring Ironsides Cromwell. He may have also continued publishing stories through D C Thomson & Co. Ltd, a Dundee- based rival of Amalgamated that was less affected by paper shortage. His serialised novels included the Norman Conquest and Ironsides Cromwell stories. Dare-Devil Conquest formed the basis for the 1954 movie Park Plaza 605 starring Tom Conway.

In modern times, it is a community within the urbanized portion of the independent city of Virginia Beach, the largest city in Virginia. History Kempsville was originally called Kempe's Landing, and subsequently Kemp‚Äôs Landing, after George Kempe, an industrious English immigrant, who in the 1600s acquired land along the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River and developed it into a colonial port for the shipment of tobacco and other goods.\\"What's in a Name? Kempsville\\" by Bill Bartel, Virginian-Pilot (Dec 5, 2011)Ferebee, E.E. and J. Pendleton Wilson, Jr.; \\"An Economic and Social Survey of Princess Anne County\\"; University of Virginia, 1924. \\"Early Towns in Princess Anne County\\", pp. 12-16 Kemp‚Äôs Landing was laid out into half acre lots which were sold at public auction after being advertised in the Virginia Gazette. The purchasers held the lots subject to building within three years a dwelling house at least 20 feet square with a brick chimney.Ferebee, Wilson; p. 14 Tugs and sailing vessels (frequently two masted schooners) often came to Kempsville. A large drawbridge crossed the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River where the much smaller bridge of Princess Anne Road now crosses the river.Ferebee, Wilson; p. 15 Kempsville was the shipping point for most of the products of Princess Anne County. The County was then a very large producer of corn and wheat. Several large warehouses lined the banks of the river which was then much wider than today. Great quantities of oak ‚Äúknees‚Äù and all kinds of timber were shipped from Kempsville to Norfolk Navy Yard. Until 1861 Kempsville was quite a busy place. It had a tobacco warehouse and an inspector whose salary was ¬£35 a year. The warehouse receipts were used as currency. However, the growing of tobacco made little headway in the sandy soil of Princess Anne County.Herndon, Melvin; \\"Tobacco in Colonial Virginia\\", p. 20 A canal company was incorporated to connect the headwaters of the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River with the headwaters of the Lynnhaven River. The Commonwealth of Virginia government bought part of the stock of the canal company, but the Civil War put an end to digging of the canal and it was never finished. From 1762 to 1770, George Logan, a Scot, was the Princess Anne County High Sheriff. From 1772 to 1775, George Logan was one of the Princess Anne County Justices. During the Revolution, George Logan was a Loyalist. On November 14 or 15, 1775, John Ackiss, the son of a former member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and six others were killed by Colony of Virginia Governor Lord Dunmore's British forces during the Battle of Kemp's Landing. These seven men were the first American Revolutionary War casualties in Virginia. In 1929, the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a plaque \\"Skirmish of Kempsville\\" near the site. On November 16, 1775, Lord Dunmore entered Kempsville in triumph. Dunmore captured the Colonial Commander then set up his headquarters at Logan‚Äôs home. Those who swore an oath of allegiance to King George III wore a red badge on their breasts. After the November 16, 1775 Battle of Kempsville, George Logan entertained Lord Dunmore at his home. This house became the home of Dr. R. E. Whitehead. In 1778, the Princess Anne County Court House was moved to Kemp‚Äôs Landing from New Town. From 1778-1824, Kempsville was the location of the county seat of Princess Anne County. On August 13, 1779, nine African slaves were sold at public auction at Kempsville. They had been taken by the Continental frigates Boston and Deane then transported in the privateer Enterprise. Also on August 13, 1779, a British sloop of war the ‚ÄúMermaid,‚Äù was sold at public auction at Kempsville by order of the Admiralty Court then held at Hampton. On May 5, 1783, the town of Kempsville was incorporated in Princess Anne County, Virginia. On September 5, 1814, during the War of 1812, the Princess Anne County Court ordered that its records be moved to safety in North Carolina. On March 6, 1815, the Court ordered the clerk to retrieve its records from North Carolina. On July 28, 1815, the Court allocated money to six men to retrieve the records. In 1824, the county seat of Princess Anne County was moved to its current location at Princess Anne, Virginia. In July 1843 the construction of Emmanuel Episcopal Church was completed on land that had been donated by David Walke. On November 27, 1843, the Right Reverend William Meade consecrated the Emmanuel Episcopal Church building. Portions of the Emmanuel Episcopal Church‚Äòs outer walls are original. The cemetery on the church grounds includes the graves of nine veterans of both the Confederate States of America and United States of America Armies who fought in the American Civil War. It also contains the more recent grave of Allen Jones \\"Al\\" \\"Two Gun\\" Gettel, a local boy that made his first pitch on the ball fields now preserved as Kempes Landing Park, who grew up to be a major league pitcher for the New York Yankees, the Cleveland Indians, and the Chicago White Sox over a 10-year career (1945‚Äì55). The Princess Anne Academy was located at the old jail in Kempsville. The Academy closed in 1850. The ancestors of many of the prominent families of the city of Norfolk and Princess Anne County attended the Academy. For example, in December 1835 then again in 1838, the Academy‚Äôs principle trustee, Mr. Rogers, advertised in the Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald for a teacher for 1836 then 1839 of Latin, Greek, English, and Math, including the elements of Euclid if required. In 1850, a number of prominent citizens of Kempsville advocated for a turnpike road from Norfolk to Kempsville. However, the road was not constructed until 1871 or 1872. After Reconstruction, during an election, several African Americans were killed and many wounded in a riot. A number of European Americans were brought before the court but nothing came from this proceeding. In 1897, the tavern that had been erected on the former Court House land was destroyed by fire. In 1922, the former Court House and jail were still in use. The former Court House was remodeled in 1902. In 1922 Kempsville was a ‚Äúbeautiful little country village‚Äù with two churches, a few stores of general merchandise, and a modern brick school building. This farming community had extremely fertile land that mainly grew potatoes, cotton, corn, and many truck crops. Formation of the City of Virginia Beach In 1963, when the \\"new\\" city of Virginia Beach was created from the merger of the small oceanfront resort city of Virginia Beach and Princess Anne County, Kempsville became one of seven boroughs of the new city. The other six were Bayside, Blackwater, Lynnhaven, Princess Anne, Pungo, and Virginia Beach (oceanfront). Kempsville grew in population during the explosive economic growth of the 1960s and 1970s. Kempsville transformed into a sprawling suburban community of the largest independent city in Virginia. Many of the important historical buildings of Kempsville were either moved or torn down during this transformation. Only two buildings remain from the Revolutionary War period, including the Carraway House (built 1734) on South Witchduck Road. and Pleasant Hall (1779) Present day Kempsville is one of seven residence districts in the City of Virginia Beach, and is thereby associated with one seat on City Council. Although the official land area of the Kempsville district is small relative to the size of the City of Virginia Beach, Kempsville's historical influence stretches the entire span of Princess Anne Road from the Norfolk border to the Courthouse and Pungo areas of the city. Schools The community of Kempsville operates under the Virginia Beach City Public School System. There are three high schools, three middle schools, and eight elementary schools, respectively: Kempsville High School, Tallwood High School, Salem High School, Kempsville Middle School, Brandon Middle School, Larkspur Middle School, Arrowhead Elementary, Centerville Elementary, Fairfield Elementary, Kempsville Elementary, Kempsville Meadows Elementary, Point O' View Elementary, Providence Elementary Tallwood Elementary, and Woodstock Elementary. Regent University, a private Christian facility founded in 1977 by Pat Robertson, is located in Kempsville, as are the Christian Broadcasting Network headquarters and The Founders Inn & Spa. Public Safety The 4th Precinct is based in Kempsville giving the community police protection by the Virginia Beach Police Department. Fire protection is provided by the Virginia Beach Fire Department through Fire Station 9 and Fire Station 10 in the VBFD system. The Kempsville Volunteer Rescue Squad provides ambulance transportation and EMS services as part of the Virginia Beach Department of EMS. Retail The two major shopping centers in the Kempsville community are located directly across the street from each other on the Southwest and Northwest Corners of the Kempsville Road and Providence Road intersection. They are Providence Square and Fairfield Shopping Centers, respectively. These areas are home to several restaurants including Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Moe's Southwest Grill, AJ Gator's Sports Bar, Frankies Place For Ribs, Papa John's, McDonald's, Wendy's, YNot Pizza, and Subway. They also house the grocery stores Kroger and Food Lion as well as some businesses such as banks, dental offices, Madison Jewelers, QW Alterations and Kitchen King Cabinets. About 0.1 miles north from the Kempsville Road and Providence Road intersection is the 4th VBPD Police Precinct Station, which is located next to the Kempsville Public Library. Also, across Kempsville Road is the Kempsville Presbyterian Church. Kemps River Crossing is another major shopping center, taking its name from its location at the intersection of Kempsville and Indian River Roads. Neighborhoods Kempsville residential neighborhoods include Acredale, Arrowhead, Avalon Hills, Bellamy Manor, Carolanne Farms, College Park, Fairfield, Indian Lakes, Lake Christopher, Lake James, Larkspur Farms, Point o' View, Salem, Stratford Chase, and Whitehurst Landing. The neighborhood of Point o' View is situated on the banks of Kemps Lake that formed from the construction of Interstate 264/Virginia Beach Expressway. Kemps Lake provides opportunities for water sports with its deepest point of . Road Construction Project A major road construction project was completed involving Princess Anne, Kempsville, and Witchduck Roads. The Witchduck Road portion and this intersection is one of the busiest corridors in Virginia Beach. Kempsville Rd./Witchduck Rd. has been widened to 3 lanes in each direction (north and south) with a new intersection of Princess Anne Rd, Kempsville Road and Witchduck Rd. The widened road extends from the Interstate 264 overpass on Witchduck Rd. south bound to the Kempsville Rd/Princess Anne Intersection at the heart of the Kempsville Community. Now that this road project is completed, a Historic Kempsville Retail District is anticipated to be built in the area surrounding this intersection featuring colonial architecture with retail shopping. The plans for this retail district were envisioned before the recent economic downturn, so much of the proposed new development in the area may take much longer to come to fruition than originally conceived. On the southeastern corner of the new intersection, construction of the Kemps Landing public park has been completed with a small lake, strolling walkways and a large gazebo resembling the one at James and Dolley Madison's Montpelier estate located in Orange, Virginia. Though construction of the park is complete, there is currently very limited public access to the property as construction is in progress nearby.

Originally, Rambeau was to debut the song on American Bandstand in 1962, but mere minutes before Rambeau was to perform, he was told the song could not be sung, due to Barris then being an ABC employee, owing to concerns of payola, which had become a major music industry scandal at the time. That was also the reason for the record not receiving airplay on any ABC-owned radio station, weighing the song down so it was not a hit. Later, Barris contacted composer Milton DeLugg to arrange an instrumental version of the song, which eventually wound up on the game show The Newlywed Game and would become its signature theme song (the main melody of the theme is preceded by Felix Mendelssohn's Wedding March).

It was known as the Centennial Library from 1977 until 2005. The library is located at 251 Donald St, and serves approximately 5,000 visitors each day. The four storey, library boasts a local history room, public art, information displays, a grand staircase, as well as access to the Winnipeg Walkway system. The Best of Friends Gift Shop is also situated within the building.  History  Interior reading terrace In May 1968 Mayor Stephen Juba proposed that a new Centennial Library be built by 1970 to honour Manitoba's 100th birthday. A plan was put in place to relocate the main branch on Graham Avenue between Smith and Donald Streets, on the site of Columbus Hall (Aragon Bldg.) where Bell Drugs, Rainbow Dance Gardens, and J's Discotheque were located. In March 1969, the city announced it wanted to purchase the land between Graham and St. Mary and Smith and Donald for $1.75 million. The construction of the new library and underground parking for 500 cars cost $9 million. In December 1973, Ward, MacDonald, Cockburn, McLeod and McFeetors were selected as the architectural firm to design the new library. The province chipped in $900,000 towards the cost. A sod turning ceremony, commencing construction was held on December 20, 1974, with actual construction beginning in March. The new library would have room for 600,000 books within its 350,000 sq. ft. The construction tender was awarded to Poole Construction Ltd. (now PCL). The original cost of the project was estimated at $8,478,462, though that figure had risen to $9 million afterwards. A construction strike and winter work conditions caused the project to be completed four months later than originally calculated. The underground parkade, for 550 vehicles, opened early December 1976. The Central branch (380 William Ave.) closed February 21 and the Downtown branch (408 Portage Ave.) closed February 25, 1977 so that materials could be moved over to the new Centennial Library. The library was opened to the public on March 16, 1977 as the Centennial Library. It replaced the Central branch on William Avenue. Fifty-five hundred people visited on opening day, and 5,188 books and magazines were checked out. Al Ducharme (ICEC - St. Vital) greeted members of the public and borrowed the first book at the new library. = Expansion = Started in 2003 and completed in 2005, the $21 million redevelopment of Winnipeg's main library branch involved the addition of of new space, construction of a new fourth floor and renovations throughout the existing library. The library now features a new Reading Terrace with a four storey high solar glass wall, positioned alongside a new grand staircase, along with two new glass elevators, and a passive solar wall on the southeast face of the building. The Millennium Library opened on November 8, 2005 after $18 million of renovations were constructed over a two-year period. The work was completed a year late and $4 million over budget. In 2013, Toronto-Dominion Bank presented a $150,000 gift to be used towards renovations of Millennium Library's TD New and Noted area. The renovations will include open-concept space, as well as direct access to Millennium Library Park.

Millennium Library Park  Finished 2012, the park alongside the Millennium Library underwent a $4.3-million reconstruction. The rebuilt plaza has an artificial wetland aerated by a pair of windmills, a wooden walkway built out of sustainably farmed wood, birch trees planted in deep pots, two new pieces of public art, and low fences and a raised floor. The park now features five distinct outdoor zones: * The Millennium Plaza * Crossroads Plaza * The Learning Commons * The Urban Wetland * The Jim Pattison Foundation Reading Garden When the Millennium Library reopened, there was no money left in the budget to rebuild the park. Work on the park could not commence until a membrane was built over the parkade below it. Rebuilding the plaza itself was funded equally by all three levels of government. The Winnipeg Arts Council arranged financing for the two pieces of public art: Sentinel Of Truth and emptyful. Reconstruction Costs: * $2.1 million to rebuild the plaza * $1.5 million to replace a membrane over the roof of the Millennium Library Parkade * $575,000 to commission and install \\"emptyful\\" * $90,000 for \\"Sentinel Of Truth\\" The redevelopment plan was spearheaded by the Winnipeg Library Foundation.  Public Art  The following public art installations are viewable in and around the Millennium Library. * Bill Pechet's \\"emptyful\\" (Park) - a stainless steel sculpture including water elements * Darren Stebeleski's \\"Sentinel of Truth\\" (Park) - a wall of weathering steel, covering and protecting bits of text inscribed into stainless steel. * Cliff Eyland's \\"Untitled\\" (Lobby) * Nicholas Wade's \\"Illumination\\" (Richardson Reading Terrace base) * Charlie Johnson's \\"Story Lines\\" mural (Skywalk) * J.A.

It is illuminated by four bands of LED lights at night and uses both water and fog. During the summer, when the fog and water elements will be operational, the fountain is illuminated in blue, green and purples hues. During the winter, when the water elements are not operational, the artwork is lit up with reds, oranges and yellows.

Numerous incidents involving aggressive visitors to the library, some involving weapons, open liquor have been documented by the Winnipeg Police Service and the head of the Winnipeg Public Library. In early 2019 the staff of the Library felt that they needed to increase the level of security, to protect both the staff who provide assistance and for patrons who are there to study. Measures were taken, where weapons and liquor were held by a private security firm and could be collected after the library visitor had left. When the new security protocol came into effect on February 28, 2019 a group of university students had created an ad-hoc group, opposing the changes, saying it invades patron's privacy. The library reported in early September 2019 that the new security measures had the intended effect of decreasing the numbers aggressive patrons who bring in weapons and/or alcohol. However, it has also had the unintended effect of decreasing the numbers of legitimate patrons who are there to study. In February 2020, musician John K. Samson wrote and released \\"Millennium for All\\", a song supporting the activist campaign against the security restrictions.Sarah Murphy, \\"John K.

It has been shown that if one believes that war is biologically determined, he or she is less likely to engage in activities to promote peace. Conversely, if one believes that war is not biologically determined, one is more likely to work for peace. http://culture-of-peace.info/myth/title-page.html David Adams and Sarah Bosch, The myth that war is intrinsic to human nature discourages action for peace by young people, in J. Ramfrez, R. Hinde, andj. Groeble (eds.), Essays on Violence, 121‚Äî37 (Seville: University of Seville Press, 1987, retrieved May 16, 2018. In fact, according to international surveys in 1972Eckhardt, William 1972. \\"Crosscultural theories of war and aggression,\\" International Journal of Group Tensions, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 36-51. about half of all young people believed that war was biologically determined. The result was replicated by studies in Finland https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00291463.1984.10636883 Riitta Wahlstrom, On the psychological premises for peace education Nordisk Psykologi 1984 36 (3): 160-168 and the United StatesDouglas Fry and James N. Welch. Beliefs about Human Nature and Conflict: Implications for Peace Education. American Anthropological Association, San Francisco, CA, 2-6 December, 1992 . John Horgan reported in 2009 that 185 out of 205 surveyed students at Purdue University believed that humans would never stop fighting wars.  Criticism  Steven Pinker has criticized the Seville Statement as being an example of the moralistic fallacy.Pinker, Steven. How the Mind Works. W. W. Norton & Company, 1997, pp. 44 and 49. Some scientists believe both evolutionary psychology and neuropsychology suggest that human violence does indeed have biological roots.Jones, Dan \\"Human behaviour: Killer instincts\\", Nature, January 30, 2008.Moran, Melanie \\"Brain rewards aggression much like it does sex, food, drugs\\", Physorg.com, February 1, 2008. Pinker has used the Seville Statement as an example of the idea of biological determinism, the incorrect idea that genes are solely responsible for any of our behaviors. A 2008 article in Nature by Dan Jones stated that \\"The decades since have not been kind to these cherished beliefs. A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought.\\" Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the Cinderella effect). Chimpanzees have violence between groups, which has similarities to raids and violence between groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower in humans living in small group societies than in chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between ingroup and outgroup, which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies, which suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced blood feuds due to better functioning justice systems may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.

They are well known for two performances in an advertisement for Honda, and at the Academy Awards. It is conducted by Steve Sidwell, who is also the composer of their repertoire. The advert for Honda followed the advert from April 2003, ‚ÄúCog‚Äù, which showcased the Honda Accord. Production of Effects Sound effects are produced primarily by means of using the mouth; the arms, fingers, and hands are also sometimes used. For example, the performers would tap their fingernails against their teeth, to simulate rain falling on a car's windshield. To simulate wind, one would quickly blow air. To imitate the sound of tires squealing, a soprano would make a high pitched screeching sound. Performances The ensemble was featured in a television advertisement for a Honda Civic in January 2006, called Choir, which gained immense popularity. The advertisement was made by the company Wieden and Kennedy, and shown mainly at countries in Europe such as the United Kingdom. This performance consisted of sixty vocalists, and was filmed in a car park in the end of November 2005. In February 2007, the Choir also appeared as performers in the 79th Academy Awards, producing sound effects to a collection of different film clips in a piece called Elements and Motion. A video of these movie clips was shown behind the forty person choir, as they performed in Kodak Theater. Although much praise was given to this particular performance, it has received some criticism of not reaching the high expectations set in any Academy Award festival. Awards The television advertisement for the Honda Civic, that the Sound Effects Choir was featured in, won the Gold Lion Award in the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in September 2006, generally regarded as the most prestigious international advertising festival.

He is a major link in the old and well-known theory that his widow, Bridget Bishop, was executed on trumped up charges because her in- laws were jealous of what she had inherited from him. Upham's History of the Salem Witchcraft Trials makes clear that her marriage to Thomas Oliver is a determining factor in the witchcraft prosecution of Bridget Oliver Bishop.  First marriage: Mary Leman  Oliver married Mary Leman on 29 Jan 1626 in Norwich Norfolk England. They originally immigrated to Boston, with 2 children and 2 servants, on the \\"Mary Anne\\" in 1637. At that time Thomas Oliver's profession was calender. They moved to Salem where he accumulated property which he left there when they returned to England. Mary's constant and unpleasant public comments (especially her support of Roger Williams) caused her to be punished as early as 1638. Thomas Oliver's inability or perhaps unwillingness to control her caused them to be exiled from the Colony and return to England c. 1649. They had at least 3 sons, and according to Upham at least 3 daughters. One daughter married a constable who may have caused Bridget Oliver Bishop to be brought up on charges of witchcraft.Salem Witchcraft with an account of Salem Village and a history of opinions on Witchcraft and Kindred Subjects.

Charles W. Upham, NY: Frederick Unger Pub Co, 1978, 2 v. After his death she was brought up on charges of witching him to death (this was not the first time she was accused of witchcraft, but it was perhaps the first time she was put on trial). This time she was acquitted. However this seems to have set her up for the second charge in 1692 as the result of which she was hanged.  Estate  When he left the colony for England he had a considerable amount of real property to which he returned after his first wife Mary's death. His estate included a house and sometime tavern in Salem, Massachusetts near the meeting house where after his death his widow Bridget Oliver Bishop was known for staying up late into the night entertaining her guests with playing shovelboard. During the scholarly reexaminations of the Salem witch trials during the 19th century, Bridget Bishop's claims on this estate were posited as the real reason for her being accused of witchcraft. In one of his books Upham makes clear that one of the police officials was married to one of her in-laws who had expressed jealousy of Bridget Oliver Bishop's having property near the meeting house at Salem.  Family Connections  One of his daughters married a constable. Further, the wife of one of the judges had a grandmother whose surname was Oliver.Francis Winslow and his Forbears and Life Based upon Family Records and Correspondence during 30 Years.

He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football for the Virginia Tech Hokies. Rouse was also a member of the New York Giants, Arizona Cardinals and Omaha Nighthawks. In 2018, he entered and won the election for an at-large seat on the Virginia Beach city council. In February 2020, Rouse entered the race for Virginia Beach mayor, but he dropped out of the race in May. Early years Rouse attended First Colonial High School in Virginia where he excelled at many positions, including outside linebacker and wide receiver. He was named first- team Group AAA by The Associated Press and second-team by the state coaches as a linebacker. In his senior year, he was named Defensive Player of the Year in the Virginia Beach District, yet lost the state award to Kai Parham, who also played in the Beach District. He also lettered in basketball. College career Rouse redshirted his freshman year. At the backup 'Field' outside linebacker position, he finished the season with 46 total tackles (19 solo tackles) with three tackles for losses, one forced fumble and two pass deflections. He was selected to the Freshman All-American team by Rivals.com while appearing in 13 games and starting only one. During his sophomore season, Rouse remained at his backup position at outside linebacker. He finished the season with 37 total tackles (16 solo tackles) with 2.5 tackles for losses and one forced fumble. At the end of the season, Rouse switched from weak outside linebacker to the defensive backfield at safety. Rouse had an outstanding junior season in 2005 opening at the 'Rover' safety position, collecting 77 total tackles and five interceptions, which prompted him to be named a First-Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection and one of the top safeties in the country. He was the leader of the Virginia Tech defense and elected to stay in college for his senior season. He had a reputation of hard hits, sometimes resulting in penalties. During the 2006 season, his senior season, Rouse did not live up to the standard of performance he'd set for himself the previous season; Rouse had an extremely poor performance in the game against Georgia Tech which landed him on the bench before the end of the game. He had another disappointing performance the next week against Boston College which led to him splitting time at the safety position with fellow senior safety, Carey Wade, for a three-week stretch four games before the end of the season. He returned to the starting spot for the final four games of the season, having started ten total games for the season. Rouse finished his senior season with 57 total tackles, one forced fumble, two pass deflections and two interceptions. Rouse finished his college career at Virginia Tech with 217 total tackles (93 solo tackles), 12 tackles for losses, four forced fumbles with one recovery, nine passes defensed and five interceptions. Rouse made 24 starts in 52 career games at Virginia Tech. Professional career =Pre-draft= Rouse entered the 2007 NFL Draft as one of the top prospects at safety with his unmatched combination of size, strength and speed. At 6'4, 223 pounds, he ran 4.59 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine. While his physical attributes impressed scouts, his lackluster senior season drastically reduced his draft stock; Rouse was projected by many as a late first-round to second- round draft pick. Rouse was drafted in the third round (89th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers. On June 8, he signed a 4-year, $2.3 million contract with the Packers. Rouse was cut by the Green Bay Packers on September 23, 2009. =Green Bay Packers= After an injury to starting safety Nick Collins, Rouse made his first NFL start on November 11, during a 34‚Äì0 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. On November 18, Rouse recorded his first interception, when he picked off a Vinny Testaverde pass on Carolina Panthers' opening possession in a 31‚Äì17 victory over the Panthers. The following week, in a 37‚Äì26 win over the Detroit Lions, Rouse recorded his second career interception in just his second career start. He was nominated for the week 12 Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week award for his performance against the Detroit Lions where he made a key game-changing interception against fellow rookie Calvin Johnson. He finished his rookie campaign with 25 total tackles (22 solo tackles, two assists), four pass deflections and two interceptions while playing in 11 total games, starting in three of them. Rouse helped Green Bay win the 2007 NFC North division championship. The Packers finished the season losing to the New York Giants 23‚Äì20 in the NFC Championship Game, missing out on going to Super Bowl XLII. Rouse entered the 2008 season as the backup strong safety behind starter Atari Bigby but an injury to Bigby during the Week 2 matchup at Detroit promoted Rouse to starting strong safety for the Packers third game of the season against the Dallas Cowboys and the fourth against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After sustaining a knee injury in the 4th quarter against Tampa Bay, Rouse was inactive for the Packers next contest against the Atlanta Falcons. With Bigby also still out with an injury, Rouse was reinserted into the starting line up for the next two games against the Seattle Seahawks and the Indianapolis Colts. Against the Colts, Rouse had seven tackles, two pass defenses, and an interception which he returned 99 yards for a touchdown, tying the longest interception return in Packers history. He was named NFL Defensive player of the week for that performance. After Atari Bigby returned from injury, Rouse returned to his backup role for the next couple of games until he was injured after his interception in the Monday Night Football game at New Orleans. Rouse was inactive for the next contest vs Carolina. Rouse again entered the season as a backup but started in Week 2 against the Cincinnati Bengals in place of the injured Atari Bigby. He recorded 9 tackles, 2 assisted, in the game. However, he was released from the team on the following Wednesday, September 23, 2009 and replaced by Matt Giordano. =New York Giants= Rouse was claimed off waivers by the New York Giants on September 24, 2009 after Kenny Phillips was placed on injured reserve. He was released on March 6, 2010. =Arizona Cardinals= Rouse signed with the Arizona Cardinals on August 3, 2010.Cutting Sheik, Highsmith among Cards‚Äô moves He was waived on August 18. =Omaha Nighthawks= After being released by the Cardinals, Rouse signed with the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League for the 2010 season. =Virginia Destroyers= Rouse continued with the UFL for the 2011 season, joining the Virginia Destroyers for the 2011 season. A highlight of Rouse's time with the Destroyers was the 2011 UFL Championship Game, in which Rouse recorded three interceptions en route to a 17‚Äì3 win; Rouse was designated the game MVP. Political career 2020 mayoral campaign logo In 2018, Rouse ran for an at-large seat on the Virginia Beach City Council. There were six candidates running for two seats. Rouse got the most votes and was elected alongside incumbent councilman John Moss. On February 27, 2020, Rouse announced he would run for mayor in the November election, facing incumbent Bobby Dyer. On May 30, 2020, he announced that he was dropping out of the race citing the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for ending his campaign.

Macloon told Gable, \\"You'll do, my boy.\\" The Great Lover Clark Gable - By Jim Tully - The Family Circle July 4th, 1941 Macloon's career with producing partner and wife Lillian Albertson was prolific, marking over a decade of successful plays and musicals from New York to Chicago and Los Angeles, including It Pays to Sin, which they translated from Hungarian. Entrepreneur Macloon was also an entrepreneur, and was a major investor in Almac Yacht Corporation, of Mystic, Connecticut, which built fifty foot Seven Seas Cruisers with interiors designed by Joseph Urban, the noted architect of the Ziegfeld Theatre. Death Macloon died 13 August 1979 at age 86 in Baker City, Oregon.

JC3IEDM is an evolution of the C2IEDM standard that includes joint operational concepts, just as the Land Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (LC2IEDM) was extended to become C2IEDM. The program is managed by the Multilateral Interoperability Programme (MIP).  The Joint C3 Information Exchange Data Model  JC3IEDM is produced by the MIP-NATO Management Board (MNMB) and ratified under NATO STANAG 5525. JC3IEDM a fully documented standard for an information exchange data model for the sharing of C2 information. The overall aim of JC3IEDM is to enable \\"international interoperability of C2 information systems at all levels from corps to battalion (or lowest appropriate level) in order to support multinational (including NATO), combined and joint operations and the advancement of digitisation in the international arena.\\" According to JC3IEDM's documentation, this aim is attempted to be achieved by \\"specifying the minimum set of data that needs to be exchanged in coalition or multinational operations. Each nation, agency or community of interest is free to expand its own data dictionary to accommodate its additional information exchange requirements with the understanding that the added specifications will be valid only for the participating nation, agency or community of interest. Any addition that is deemed to be of general interest may be submitted as a change proposal within the configuration control process to be considered for inclusion in the next version of the specification.\\" \\"JC3IEDM is intended to represent the core of the data identified for exchange across multiple functional areas and multiple views of the requirements. Toward that end, it lays down a common approach to describing the information to be exchanged in a command and control (C2) environment. # The structure should be sufficiently generic to accommodate joint, land, sea, and air environmental concerns. # The data model describes all objects of interest in the sphere of operations, e.g., organizations, persons, equipment, facilities, geographic features, weather phenomena, and military control measures such as boundaries. # Objects of interest may be generic in terms of a class or a type and specific in terms of an individually identified item. All object items must be classified as being of some type (e.g. a specific tank that is identified by serial number WS62105B is an item of type \\"Challenger\\" that is a heavy UK main battle tank). # An object must have the capability to perform a function or to achieve an end. Thus, a description of capability is needed to give meaning to the value of objects in the sphere of operations. # It should be possible to assign a location to any item in the sphere of operations. In addition, various geometric shapes need to be represented in order to allow commanders to plan, direct, and monitor operations. Examples include boundaries, corridors, restricted areas, minefields, and any other control measures needed by commanders and their staffs. # Several aspects of status of items need to be maintained. # The model must permit a description of the composition of a type object in terms of other type objects. Such concepts include tables of organizations, equipment, or personnel. # The model must reflect information about what is held, owned or possessed in terms of types by a specific object item. # There is a need to record relationships between pairs of items. Key among these is the specification of unit task organizations and orders of battle. # The model must support the specification of current, past, and future role of objects as part of plans, orders, and events. # The same data structure should be used to record information for all objects, regardless of their hostility status. # Provision must be made for the identification of sources of information, the effective and reporting times, and an indication of the validity of the data.\\" JC3IEDM development history and current maturity JC3IEDM has been developed from the initial Generic Hub (GH) Data Model, which changed its name to Land C2 Information Exchange Data Model (LC2IEDM) in 1999. Development of the model continued in a Joint context and in November 2003 the C2 Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) Edition 6.1 was released. Additional development to this model, incorporating the NATO Corporate Reference model, resulted in the model changing its name again to JC3IEDM with JC3IEDM Ed 0.5 being issued in December 2004. Subsequent releases have seen areas of the model developed in greater depth than others and there is variation in the number of sub-types and attributes for each type in the current version. An example is HARBOUR within the FACILITY type which has 43 attributes compared to a VESSEL-TYPE with 12 attributes or a WEAPON-TYPE with 4 attributes. The associated attributes of a certain type also lack support for exploiting with those of other types. For example, VESSEL-TYPE does not support the length or width of a vessel in its attributes but HARBOUR has both maximum vessel length and width attributes. National policies related to JC3IEDM The UK Ministry of Defence has mandated JC3IEDM as the C2 Information Exchange Model, in Joint Service Publication (JSP) 602:1007, for use on all systems and/or projects exchanging C2 information within and interoperating with the Land Environment at a Strategic and Operational Level. It is strongly recommended for other environments and mandated for all environments at the Tactical level. JSP 602:1005 for Collaborative Services has also mandated JC3IEDM in the tactical domain for all systems/projects providing data sharing collaborative services.

It may irritate the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.  Synthesis  Bismuth subcarbonate can be attained from the reaction between bismuth nanoparticles and the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in water. Bismuth subcarbonate has the tendency to form nanoplates, but it can be also obtained as small round nanospheres (with controlled size) when it is grown in the presence of halloysite nanotubes. The high pH and high temperature of the aqueous solution helps to reduce the time of synthesis. It is readily formed on the surface of undoped bismuth oxide (Œ≤-Bi2O3 and Œ≥-Bi2O3) nanoparticles even when they are not suspended in water.  Structure  Bismuth subcarbonate has a structure with a tetragonal unit cell. Layers of (BiO)n positively charged, and carbonate anion (CO32-) are surrounding both sides of the (BiO)n+ layer to compensate the charge. Usually, The (BiO)n layer grows perpendicular to the b axis.

Uhthoff specialized in the study of ophthalmological disorders that were related to the central nervous system. In 1890 he described a condition of temporary vision loss linked to physical exercise, and associated with optic neuritis. This condition was to become known as Uhthoff's phenomenon, and was later found to be caused by a rise in body temperature. In 1915 he published a treatise titled Augensymptome bei Grosshirntumoren in which gave an early description of a neuro-ophthalmic disorder that was to become known as Foster Kennedy syndrome.Kennedy's syndrome (www.whonamedit.com) at www.whonamedit.com However, the disease was to be named after Robert Foster Kennedy (1884‚Äì1952), who provided a more comprehensive (and earlier) account of the disorder.

Coloration varies between individuals, but typically the moth is olive green and burgundy on its back, and white or yellow and burgundy on the underside. Its wings are transparent with a reddish-brown border. It has light-colored legs, which combined with the lack of striping on the underside is diagnostic. Beating its wings rapidly, H. thysbe hovers to collect nectar from a variety of flowers. The combination of its appearance and its behavior commonly leads to it being confused with a hummingbird or bumblebee. Hemaris thysbe is found in a large portion of North America, with a range extending from Alaska to Oregon in the west and from Newfoundland to Florida in the east. It is a migratory species and is most common in southern Ontario and the eastern United States. H. thysbe has two broods a year in the southern portion of its range, but only one in the north. As a caterpillar, it feeds on honeysuckle, dogbane, and several types of fruit trees. Due to the variable appearance of H. thysbe, it has often been mistakenly described as multiple distinct species. It was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. The moth is a flower pollinator. Description The body of an adult Hemaris thysbe moth is spindle shaped, and is largely covered by a thick coat of fur. There is significant variation in coloration between individuals. Typically, the back side of the moth is olive to golden-olive on the thorax and burgundy to black with light olive to dark golden patches on the abdomen. The underside of the moth is white to yellow on the thorax and burgundy to black on the abdomen. When it first hatches, the wings of H. thysbe are dark red to black. As it begins to fly, scales fall off leaving a mostly clear wing with reddish- brown borders and veins. The width and shape of the border as well as the patterning of the veins vary between individuals. The moth beats its wings quite rapidly and has a wingspan of . H. thysbe has light-colored, often yellow legs. In general, southern broods and individuals hatched later in the season are darker in color. Southern and eastern populations generally exhibit jagged wing borders, while northern and western ones are usually smooth. Hemaris thysbe extends its long proboscis to feed from a flower The antennae of H. thysbe are thicker at their base and are curved at the ends. Unlike most moths, the species lacks hearing organs. It has compound eyes and well- developed reproductive organs. Hemaris thysbe can be distinguished from Hemaris gracilis and Hemaris diffinis by the lack of stripes on the underside of its thorax and by its pale legs. (Legs are reddish in H. gracilis and black in H. diffinis.) The H. thysbe caterpillar is yellowish green with bands of dark green and reddish brown to dark brown. It has a granulose body with small, white spots and a white horn projecting from its posterior. As a caterpillar, H. thysbe feeds on cherry trees, European cranberry bush, hawthorns, dogbane, honeysuckle, and snowberry. It burrows into the soil to overwinter as a brown, hard-shelled pupa. In the late spring, it emerges as an adult moth. H. thysbe lays green eggs on the underside of plant leaves, which hatch in about a week. Development takes four weeks, after which the caterpillar spins a cocoon at ground level. Two to four weeks later a moth emerges for a second breeding cycle before summer's end in southern climates. In northern climates, H. thysbe has a single mating cycle per year. The mating and other behavioral habits of H. thysbe have not been well studied. Adults are most active during the hottest parts of the day, but remain active until sunset. H. thysbe collects nectar from a wide variety of flowers using a long () proboscis while hovering above the bloom. It shows a preference for pink and purple flowers, moving rapidly from one flower to the next. The moth is considered to be a hummingbird mimic and is frequently mistaken for the bird or for a bumblebee. Habitat and range Hemaris thysbe lives in second- growth forest, in meadows, and is commonly found in cultivated gardens of suburbia. H. thysbe is a migratory species, capable of traveling long distances. In single brood regions, adults are found throughout the summer. In the south, adults are present from March to June and from August to October. H. thysbe is most abundant in the eastern United States and southern Ontario. Its range extends eastward to Newfoundland and westward to Texas, the Great Plains, and into Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. On the west coast of North America, its range extends from Oregon, up to the Yukon Territory and Alaska. It has minimal economic impact to humans, acting neither as a crop pollinator nor as a pest. The moth does, however, pollinate several cultivated flowers, and is the primary pollinator for some species of orchid. H. thysbe is not endangered or threatened. Taxonomic history Hemaris thysbe hovers over a flower while feeding Hemaris thysbe was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775 as Sesia thysbe in his Systema Entomologiae. The specific name is likely a reference to Thisbe, half of a pair of ill-fated lovers in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The name thus associates the blood-stained scarf of Thisbe to the reddish-brown coloration of the moth. Due to the variable coloration and wing patterning of H. thysbe, it, along with other members of Hermaris, were described as many different species during the 1800s. In 1971, entomologist Ronald Hodges examined the various forms in detail. He dissected a number of specimens representing the range of H. thysbe coloration and geographic scope and found no differences in their reproductive organs. He thus concluded that the many variations represent a single species. Species collapsed into H. thysbe include: *Sphinx pelasgus Cramer, 1780 *Sesia cimbiciformis Stephens, 1828 *Sesia ruficaudis Kirby, 1837 *Sesia fuscicaudis Walker, 1856 *Haemorrhagia buffaloensis Grote & Robinson, 1867 *Haemorrhagia floridensis Grote & Robinson, 1867 *Sesia uniformis Grote, 1868 *Macroglossa etolus Boisduval, 1875 *Macroglossa pyramus Boisduval, 1875 See also *Hummingbird hawkmoth References External links *Hemaris thysbe at \\"Sphingidae of the Americas\\" *Fabricius' original description (in Latin) at Archive.org thysbe Category:Orchid pollinators Category:Moths of Canada Category:Moths of the United States Category:Moths of Mexico Category:Moths described in 1775 ","title":"Hemaris thysbe"},{"id":"9850960","text":"KRAT (92.1 FM, \\"Alt 92.1\\") is a commercial radio station located in Sparks, Nevada, broadcasting to the Reno, Nevada area airing an alternative rock format.

After returning to Finland, he served in the Finnish army and became a national hero in the Battle of Kollaa during the Winter War with the Soviet Union; with his relentless fighting spirit, he rose to legendary character on the war front.Suomen Kadettiupseerit He was wounded three times during World War II. Early life Juutilainen was born in Sortavala on 18 October 1904. His parents were railway clerk Tuomas Juutilainen and Helmi Sofia Juutilainen n√©e Kauppinen. His brother was Ilmari Juutilainen, later better known as flying ace during the wars.JUUTILAISEN VELJEKSET ‚Äì H√ÑVITT√ÑJ√Ñ-√ÑSS√Ñ JA MAROKON KAUHU (in Finnish) Juutilainen attended school in Sortavala, where he read seven classes at Sortavala Lyceum.Syrj√∂/Kansallisbiografia 2001 (in Finnish) He was athletic, who enjoyed skiing, horseback riding, fencing and Finnish baseball, the latter of which he was a member of the Sortavalan Viritys baseball team at least in 1924.YLE: Marokon Kauhu nousi legendaksi Kollaalla (in Finnish) Already as a young boy, he got his first contact with the war in 1918, participating in the Finnish Civil War by loading machine gun belts on the white side. After the war, a still minor age Juutilainen tried to volunteer for the Aunus expedition, but the recruits found that Juutilainen had forged the consent of his parents to the expedition. Nevertheless, Juutilainen decided to choose a military career as his profession. He attended the Reserve Officer School in 1925 and continued his studies at the Cadet School in 1926‚Äì1927, but had to drop out of school due to unsuitable lifestyles for the active officer and resigned from the Finnish Army in 1928. Career = French Foreign Legion = On 20 June 1930, Juutilainen travelled to France and joined the French Foreign Legion. He was transferred to Fort St. Nicolas in Southern France, near Marseille, and from there to Oran in Algeria. He spent time in a Foreign Legion training camp in the town of Sidi Bel Abb√®s. From there he was transferred to Fez and fought in several battles against the Berber rebels in the Atlas Mountains. Because of his service in Morocco, he was called \\"The Terror of Morocco\\" by Finnish troops. The war in the Atlas Mountains was long, and in 1931 the Berber offensive surrendered. Juutilainen served in the Foreign Legion for a full five years and was rewarded with the Legion Cross and French citizenship. He returned to Finland on 20 June 1935, by which that time the southern part of Morocco was under French protectorate. = The Winter War = In November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland, starting the Winter War. Juutilainen served in the Finnish army during this war, notably during the Battle of Kollaa. Major General Woldemar H√§gglund's question \\"Will Kollaa hold?\\" (\\"\\") was famously answered by Lieutenant Juutilainen: \\"Kollaa will hold, unless the orders are to run.\\" (\\"\\") During his command at Kollaa in December 1939, Juutilainen negotiated with H√§gglund about the strategy for the Kollaa Front. The Battle of Kollaa was strategically important. \\"Unless we are told to run\\" meant exactly that; a week earlier, he had received a regimental order to withdraw, which he disregarded. Afterwards, Lieutenant-Colonel and regiment commander Wilhelm Teittinen, who commanded the JR/34 at the Kollaa Front, honored Juutilainen: \\"He created the Kollaa Spirit\\". (\\"H√§n loi Kollaan hengen\\") By 1940, he was a captain commanding the \\"Moroccan company\\", a unit of \\"good shots and good skiers\\" who had all been decorated for bravery. A contemporary news report described the unit as having achieved \\"startling victories in this sector\\" during the war. Juutilainen's men called him \\"papa\\". He used the guerilla warfare skills he learned with the French Foreign Legion to train his men. By this time, Juutilainen had lost one finger of his right hand as a result of Russian shrapnel. = The Continuation War = During the offensive phase of the Continuation War, Juutilainen served as company commander and battalion commander in the Infantry Regiment 9. He had the reputation of the Winter War on his shoulders and his actions were closely monitored. Juutilainen was at his best in the front line, in the middle of a fight. In Svir, he served as commander of the Battle Division of the Infantry Regiment 3. The future Commander of the Defense Forces, Yrj√∂ Keinonen, also served as one of the company's commanders in the Combat Department.Kenraali Yrj√∂ Keinonen ‚Äì Sotaupseerit (in Finnish) After the fiercest battles of the Continuation War in Gora in 1942, Juutilainen was transferred to the command of the JR 9 garrison, a position he served in during the station wars. As a regimental commandant, he had more than a year to be promoted to 7th Division Commandant. He served as the division's commandant for a year. After that, before returning to the field army, Juutilainen served from May 1944 as commander of the 31st Prisoner of War Company. The transfer to the platoon was due to \\"continued drunkenness and the beating of the commander in April 1944\\", according to the Punishment Diary of 7th Division officers; as he served as commandant of the division's headquarters, action and excitement were replaced by alcohol that was consumed in considerable quantities. He was known as a nervous and ferocious man, and didn't bow to anyone, he was even known to have shot at the foot of a subordinate when he gave impetus to his orders; but in the front line, he took care of his men, was fair and respected by his subordinates. In the summer of 1944, Juutilainen once again took part in the fighting in the direction of the company in the direction of Loimola, and he was also there when the armistice was concluded and came into force at the beginning of September 1944.Kapteeni Aarne Juutilainen ‚Äì Sotaupseerit (in Finnish) Death Grave of Aarne Juutilainen at Malmi Cemetery in Malmi, Helsinki After the peace came, Aarne Juutilainen no longer got a grip on life, only alcoholism gave him the final upper hand.

The Voltigeurs were French military skirmish units created in 1804 by Emperor Napoleon I.http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/French_infantry.html#frenchvoltigeurs They replaced the second company of fusiliers in each existing infantry battalion. Etymology Voltigeurs ([v…îlti í≈ì Ä], English: \\"acrobats\\") were named after their originally conceived mode of operation: although they were foot soldiers, on the battlefield they were intended to jump onto the croup of cavalry horses to advance more quickly. This proved unworkable and they were trained to be elite skirmishers, but they retained their original name. Voltigeurs formed an integral part of the Grande Arm√©e's basic building blocks, the Line and Light infantry battalions. Line and Light Infantry Voltigeurs French Line Infantry grenadier (left) and voltigeur (right) c. 1808 Cornet in imperial livery and officer of the Line voltigeurs (1812) In 1804, each French Line (Ligne) and Light (L√©g√®re) infantry battalion was ordered to create one company of ninety of the best shots who would serve as elite skirmishers. The voltigeurs were skilled at sharpshooting and received specific training in marksmanship, using cover and taking the initiative. Like the grenadiers, this company would frequently be detached from the battalion to perform specialised light infantry tasks‚Äîoperating in loose formation, forming the skirmish line and screening the battalion from the enemy. The formation instruction for voltigeurs gave no indication where they were supposed to stand in the battle line. Although the original concept of skirmishers using cavalry to transport them during battle quickly proved unworkable in any large scale, voltigeurs did on occasion ride with French dragoons to battle, as recalled by a British officer on the harrowing retreat of John Moore's army prior to the Battle of Corunna. > The French had much the advantage of us in these petty warfares, for I have > frequently seen their light troops mounted behind their dragoons, so that > when they came to a favourable place to make an attack, these fellows > dismounted quite fresh, and our light troops who had been always marching, > had to oppose them; still we managed to beat them off.Lt. Col. Charles > Stevens, 1878 With the reorganization of 1807 the voltigeur company was enlarged to 120 men. When the battalion was formed up in line formation, the voltigeurs took their place on the left of the line, the second most prestigious position. The top position, the right, was occupied by the battalion's grenadier company. The French voltigeur suffered huge losses during the 1812 Russian Campaign. One account described how they were decimated by the combined forces of Russian artillery and cuirassiers after bearing the brunt of cavalry charges. After this period, the quality of the French voltigeurs declined as the new units lacked the experience and training to set them apart from their \\"non-elite\\" compatriots in the regular light infantry chasseur companies. The hastily reformed regiments of 1813, numbering up to 19, were not up to the same standard as the elite units of the Voltigeurs before the Russian campaign. Despite this, the Voltigeurs of the Guard performed admirably in the 1813‚Äì1814 campaigns. = Uniform = The uniform was made of a blue coat with yellow collar and cuffs piped red, red and green epaulettes with a yellow crescent, and yellow bugle horns on the turnbacks. From 1804, they wore shakos, but some had bicorne hats with green pompoms and a yellow brush. By 1807, all Voltigeurs had a shako which could be plain black, and have a yellow top or bottom band, or have yellow chevrons, green cords, and an all-green plume or a green plume with a yellow tip. Line voltigeurs had white trousers and lapels, while light voltigeurs had blue trousers and lapels. Voltigeurs of the Guard A French Voltigeur Porte Fanion of the Young Guard c.1811 In 1809, the French Imperial Guard's corps of Chasseurs formed the Tirailleurs-Chasseurs and Conscrit-Chasseurs regiments, part of the Young Guard. In 1811, these units were renamed Voltigeurs, forming the 1-4th regiments. The Voltigeurs of the Guard, along with their sister regiments the Tirailleurs (formerly the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers and Conscrit-Grenadiers Regiments), provided the skirmish screen for the Chasseurs and Grenadiers of Napoleon's Old Guard. During the Battle of Waterloo the Voltigeurs, along with the Tirailleurs, conducted a tenacious defense of the town of Plancenoit against a major Prussian flanking attack. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Young Guard, reinforced by some battalions of Old Guard Grenadiers, held the town until the defeat of the Middle Guard attack on the allied centre caused the army to collapse. After the abdication of Napoleon and the Second Restoration of the Bourbon kings, the surviving regiments of Voltigeurs, along with the remnants of the entire Imperial Guard, were disbanded.

Drawn from experienced men with good records in the line infantry, the Voltigeur regiments of the Imperial Guard served with distinction in the Crimean and Italian campaigns. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 they saw only limited action before the surrender of the main Imperial field army at Metz. The surviving depot companies of the Voltigeur regiments were then incorporated into the provisional regiments de march of the Republican forces. Voltigeurs in French-allied states Several Napoleonic French allies based their battalion formation on that of the French. These allies also had voltigeur companies in their battalions. The allies using the French battalion system included: * The Grand Duchy of Baden * The Duchy of Warsaw * The Kingdom of Bavaria (After 1810) * The Kingdom of Holland * The Kingdom of Italy * The Kingdom of Naples * The Kingdom of Saxony (After 1809) * The Kingdom of Westphalia * The Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg * Several minor Rheinbund states In addition, the United States organized a \\"Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen\\" (1847‚Äì1848) for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Historical Register and Dictionary of the US Army Like its French counterpart, the American voltigeur was composed of light infantry trained to fight either in conventional formations or spread out into skirmish lines.

It was first performed on Twelfth Night, 6 January 1618, in the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace. The work's failure on its initial performance, and its subsequent revision, marked a significant development in Jonson's evolving masque technique. Prince Charles The masque marked the d√©but of the young Prince Charles, the future King Charles I, in the public life of the Stuart Court. Upon the death of his older brother Prince Henry in 1612, Charles had become the heir to the throne of his father, James I; but his youth and relatively poor health (he'd suffered from rickets as a child) kept Charles from assuming the kind of public prominence that Henry had earlier enjoyed. Dancing a role in Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue marked a sort of \\"coming out\\" for Charles, just as Henry's appearance in the Jonson/Jones masque Oberon, the Faery Prince (1611) had been significant in his career. Orazio Busino, the chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to London and a member of the audience, described Charles as \\"an agile youth, handsome and very graceful.\\"Bradley and Adams, p. 103. The show Jonson's text for the masque was dominated by the usual figures of classical mythology -- in this case, Hercules faces a conflict between the competing demands of duty and pleasure; under the guidance of Mercury, a mean between the two is found in the person of Daedalus. The appearance of Comus, the Bacchus-like god of festivity and mockery, at the start of the masque may have later inspired John Milton to make the figure a central focus of his own masque Comus in 1634. Jones's set for the masque featured a large mountain meant to represent Mount Atlas; the mountain's peak was shaped like a human head that moved its eyes and changed expression. The anti-masque featured a dozen followers of Comus, men dressed in barrels, and a dozen boys costumed as frogs. A second anti- masque featured a dance of pygmies. Busino's eyewitness account of the masque's initial performance helps to explain its failure. Busino wrote that toward the end of the masque the performers' energies flagged: :Finally they danced the Spanish dance once more with their ladies and because they were tired began to lag; and the King, who is by nature choleric, grew impatient and shouted loudly, \\"Why don't they dance? What did you make me come here for? Devil take all of you, dance!\\" At once the Marquis of Buckingham, his majesty's favorite minion, sprang forward, and danced a number of high and very tiny capers with such grace and lightness that he made everyone love him, and also managed to calm the rage of his angry lord.Busino quoted in Leapman, pp. 179-80. The Marquis of Buckingham mentioned by Busino was George Villiers, who was the successor of John Ramsay and Robert Carr as the King's \\"favorite minion.\\" In one interpretation, the masque may have failed with James because it was too obviously critical of the King's personal vices -- \\"his excessive fondness for Buckingham, upon whom he lavished titles, wealth and sexual favours; his frequent inebriation; and his squandering of court revenues on over-lavish banqueting and drink.\\"Leah S. Marcus in Mueller and Loewenstein, p. 497. Revision The difficulties of the masque's creators were compounded by the fact that James's queen and Charles's mother, Anne of Denmark, who had missed the first performance due to illness, commanded a second, which occurred on Shrove Tuesday, 17 February. Jonson did a major rewrite on his text, adding a new anti-masque as its start called For the Honor of Wales, full of broad dialect humour. This revision was apparently not enough to please the naysayers among the courtly audience. Busino, for his part, disapproved of the bare-breasted costumes of some of the female masquers.Leapman, pp. 80, 180-1. But the anti-masque, which Jonson had invented in The Masque of Queens in 1609, became more prominent in Jonson's subsequent works in the genre, often opening the masque as in For the Honor of Wales. Other writers of masques were influenced in the same direction, as in The Triumph of Beauty by James Shirley (published 1646). Aftermath The career of neither Jonson nor Jones was severely impacted by the failure of Pleasure Reconciled. Jonson continued as the Court's primary author of masques for more than a decade, and Jones designed the masques for an even longer period. When the Whitehall Banqueting House burned down in January 1619, Jones replaced it with a building that is widely considered his masterpiece in architecture (see: Banqueting House, Whitehall). Jonson's text for the masque was first published in the second folio of his collected works in 1641. That text ends with the claim that the masque \\"pleased the King so well, as he would see it again\\" -- one of the more outrageous fabrications in English literature. (Jonson had died in 1637, and can't be blamed for it.) The text also exists in a transcript by the professional scribe Ralph Crane, which was prepared for Sir Dudley Carleton.Cummings, p. 106.

Havighurst worked and published well into his 80s. He died of Alzheimer's disease in January 1991 in Richmond, Indiana at the age of 90.Glenn Fowler. \\"Robert Havighurst, 90, Educator And Expert on Youth and Old Age\\", The New York Times, February 2, 1991. Background and education Havighurst was born in June 1900 in De Pere, Wisconsin. Both his father, Freeman Alfred Havighurst, and mother, Winifred Weter Havighurst, were educators at Lawrence University. He attended public schools in Wisconsin and Illinois. He obtained a B.A. from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1921, an M.A. from Ohio State University in 1922, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from Ohio State in 1924. He was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand in 1953-1954 and at the University of Buenos Aires in 1961. He received an Honorary Degree Sc. from Adelphi University in 1962 and an Hon. L.L.D. from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1963. Career He published a number of papers in journal of physics and chemistry about the structure of the atom in 1924.Biography at FreudingSlip, Retrieved March 4, 2007 He went to Harvard University as a postdoctoral fellow, studying atomic structure and publishing papers in journals of physics and chemistry. He decided to change careers in 1928, so he went into the field of experimental education. He became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1940, he became an education professor at the University of Chicago in the University's Committee on Human Development. He worked in the field of aging. Again, in the same year he was interested in international and comparative aspects of education. He wrote several books and published many papers. His best-known book called \\"Human Development and Education\\". He was named a member of the National Academy of Education in 1965. He retired in 1983. He was inducted in the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame.Biography at the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame; Retrieved March 4, 2007 Intellectual contributions Havighurst's educational research did much to advance education in the United States. Educational theory before Havighurst was underdeveloped. Children learned by rote and little concern was given to how children developed. From 1948 to 1953 he developed his highly influential theory of human development and education. The crown jewel of his research was on developmental tasks. Havighurst tried to define the developmental stages on many levels. Havighurst identified six major stages in human life covering birth to old age: * Infancy & early childhood (Birth till 6 years old) * Middle childhood (6‚Äì13 years old) * Adolescence (13‚Äì18 years old) * Early Adulthood (19‚Äì30 years old) * Middle Age (30‚Äì60 years old) * Later maturity (60 years old and over) From there, Havighurst recognized that each human has three sources for developmental tasks. They are: * Tasks that arise from physical maturation: Learning to walk, talk, control of bowel and urine, behaving in an acceptable manner to opposite sex, adjusting to menopause. * Tasks that arise from personal values: Choosing an occupation, figuring out one's philosophical outlook. * Tasks that have their source in the pressures of society: Learning to read, learning to be a responsible citizen. The developmental tasks model that Havighurst developed was age dependent and all served pragmatic functions depending on their age. Educational work and civil rights From 1967 through 1971, Havighurst directed the National Study of Indian Education, which was funded by the U.S. Office of Education. He involved Native Americans in planning the study as well as helping in field work and data analysis. The conclusions indicated that education for Native American youth across the United States varied widely according to numerous factors such as funding, location, curriculum, faculty, degree of isolation, and cultural differences. Recommendations included finding ways for Native Americans to have an increased voice in their education and the establishment of a National Commission on Indian Education. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Havighurst focused his attention on the problems of urban education. He conducted a study of public high schools in the forty-five largest cities in the United States. The study examined: educational goals, school structure and organization, staff characteristics, curriculum, student activities, student activism, and school-community relations. Havighurst concluded that there was more and deeper segregation and separation of high school students of different socioeconomic and ethnic groups in 1969 to 1970 than there was ten or twenty years before. In 1977, at age seventy-seven, he coedited a book in which he developed a series of policies and practices for the improvement of big city schools based on his research.  Quotes \\"Family life is the source of the greatest human happiness. This happiness is the simplest and least costly kind, and it cannot be purchased with money. But it can be increased if we do two things: if we recognize and uphold the essential values of family life and if we get and keep control of the process of social change so as to make it give us what is needed to make family life perform its essential functions.\\" \\"The modern world needs people with a complex identity who are intellectually autonomous and prepared to cope with uncertainty; who are able to tolerate ambiguity and not be driven by fear into a rigid, single-solution approach to problems, who are rational, foresightful and who look for facts; who can draw inferences and can control their behavior in the light of foreseen consequences, who are altruistic and enjoy doing for others, and who understand social forces and trends.\\" \\"A successful mother sets her children free and becomes free herself in the process.\\" \\"The two basic principle processes of education are knowing and valuing.\\" \\"The art of friendship has been little cultivated in our society.\\" \\"A developmental task is a task which is learned at a specific point and which makes achievement of succeeding tasks possible. When the timing is right, the ability to learn a particular task will be possible. This is referred to as a 'teachable moment.' It is important to keep in mind that unless the time is right, learning will not occur. Hence, it is important to repeat important points whenever possible so that when a student's teachable moment occurs, s/he can benefit from the knowledge.\\" Selected works * Warner, Lloyd W.; Havighurst, Robert J.; and Davis, Allison.

In June 2000, as part of the Jubille Year celebration of the Catholic Church, the Diocese of Antipolo offered Mass at the center with Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, and Archbishop Antonio Franco, Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines, who was then making a pastoral visit to the diocese. Mass was again offered at the center in 2005 to celebrate the National Eucharistic and Marian Year. The center was also the venue for a congress held in celebration of the same season. Former President Corazon Aquino and Bishop Teodoro Bacani were the main speakers. In 2007, the Diocese of Antipolo held a well-attended concert of its priests in the center. On December 5, 2008, the Center was again the venue of a Mass and program celebrating the 25th anniversary of the canonical erection of the Diocese of Antipolo.

The band was founded by Byron Byrd in Dayton, Ohio, in 1976. Additional members included Kym Yancey, Chris Jones, Gary King, John Wagner, Hollis Melson, and Shawn Sandridge. History After being signed to Capitol by Larkin Arnold, Sun was faced with an immediate problem: an incomplete band. The gap was in the rhythm section, so Byron Byrd recruited Roger Troutman and Lester Troutman (now with Zapp) and paid them to do some studio sessions so he could get the album finished. Lester laid drum tracks with Roger on bass, then Roger overdubbed guitar for four songs on the album, including \\"Live On, Dream On.\\" It was on \\"Wanna Make Love (Come Flick My BIC)\\" that Troutman (Roger) contributed his signature Talk Box embellishments. As the first single from the debut LP, Live On, Dream On (1976), \\"Wanna Make Love\\" became Sun's first hit, peaking at #31 on Billboard‚Äôs R&B; chart. With the release of their second album, Sun Power (pressed on orange vinyl in 1977), Sun sprang into a ten-piece configuration of multi-instrumentalists and vocalists that consisted of Byron Byrd, John Hampton Wagner, Christopher D. Jones, Hollis Melson, Dean Hummons, Kym Yancey, Shawn Sandridge, Bruce Hastell, Gary King and Ernie Knisley. The album also contained ‚ÄúConscience,‚Äù the song \\"Time Is Passing‚Äù (used and sampled many Rap Artists including Dr. Dre) plus the instrumental ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre So Hot,‚Äù which has been used in sports telecasts.

This time the city authorities sanctioned the rally to be held between the noon and 2 p. m., but nevertheless refused to permit protesters to march to City Hall. President Vladimir Putin visited the city on the night before the event together with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and American film actor of Belgian origin Jean-Claude Van Damme to watch a martial arts contest, but did not comment on the protest. Berlusconi noted that the number of anti-Putin protesters had been exaggerated by the media.Riot Police Violently Break Up March by Natalya Krainova and David Nowak, The Moscow Times, 16 April 2007.

Neighboring quarters were also closed to traffic and pedestrians. There were at least 1,500 police according to the march organizers. Only those protesters who had come by 12 p. m. were allowed to enter the square, leaving a number of others outside the barriers. The total number of demonstrators gathered was estimated as over 3,000 by the organizers and about 500 according to the police.

Reception In his 4 star review for the Allmusic website, Maurice Rickard states \\"Several genres and bands are skillfully evoked... and helpfully listed in the liner notes in order of occurrence. Jazz, surf, R&B;, death metal, funk, acid rock, and serialism are grafted together in this collection, often into the same song, and the band shifts genres, tempos, and arrangements on a dime. Supposedly, Radio was conceived as a set for a college radio program, making it a kind of \\"Young Person's Guide to Naked City,\\" beginning with accessible tunes, gradually building up listener tolerance to dissonance, and finally sandbagging the listener with evil blasts of dissonant metallic noise and convincing perpetrator-and-victim screaming.\\"Rickard, M.

Some fractions of migrant population like Tamil, Nepali,Punjabi, Telugu, Bihari, Marwari and Muslim Pangals lives in moreh. The official language is kuki. Moreh is already a huge commercial hub, and economists suggested that it could become a bustling city in the next couple of decades. The town is already seen as the commercial capital of Manipur and India's Gateway to South-East Asia. Moreh plays a very important role in connection with the India-Myanmar relationship and is also a rapidly developing trade point in India on the border with Myanmar, with the city of Tamu on the other side of the border. The Indo-Myanmar Friendship Bridge in Moreh connects India to Kalewa in Myanmar's Sagaing Division. The highway on the Myanmar side is intended to run up to Mandalay but it is in bad shape. Indian planners hope the rail link to Moreh will eventually be connected to the Myanmar railway system, allowing onward connectivity to Thailand and China.

Remarks  As Moreh shares a border with Myanmar, it is a transit point for trafficking illicit drugs to the international market. Road to Thailand India‚Äôs foreign minister met with Myanmar‚Äôs construction minister in Delhi on 22 February 2012, and spoke about opening a highway between Moreh, in India, and the Myanmar-Thai border near Mae Sot. Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Thein Sein have set a deadline of 2016 to provide trilateral road connectivity, that would make it possible to drive from India to Thailand via Myanmar. Trans-Asian Railway As of 2012, all freight traffic from Asia to Europe goes by sea. The Trans-Asian Railway will enable containers from Singapore, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Korea to travel over land by train to Europe. The Southern Corridor of the Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) is of prime interest to India. It connects Yunnan in China and Thailand with Europe via Turkey and passes through India. There is a general understanding between India and Myanmar that their railways will be interconnected via a line section that will extend from Kalay in Myanmar to Jiribam in India via the border point at Tamu/Moreh, India. The proposed route will enter India through Tamu and Moreh, then enter Bangladesh through Mahisasan and Shahbajpur and again enter India from Bangladesh at Gede. On the western side, the line will enter Pakistan at Attari. There is a missing link on this route in the India-Myanmar sector; of this, , in India, is between Jiribam in Manipur and Tamu, Burma in Myanmar. The rail link between Jiribam and Tapul/Imphal has been sanctioned by Indian Railways, but that is unlikely to be completed before 2016. In 2011, construction work was in progress in a stretch between Jiribam and Tupul/Imphal. India's Ministry Railway has also approved the Tapul/Imphal to Moreh, India/Tamu, Burma link.http://www.mdoner.gov.in/sites/default/files/silo3_content/railways/Railwaymap.pdf  Notes  External links * http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays- paper/tp-others/tp-states/border-woes/article2099469.ece *http://e-pao.net/epPageExtractor.asp?src=features.Indo- Myanmar_relationship_on_bilateral_and_economic_cooperation.html.. *http://www.akshardhool.com/2012/12/a-precursor-of-things-to-come.html *http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=21159 *http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganhartley/2013/03/26/burmas-second-chance- for-trade-with-india/ *http://www.irrawaddy.org/india/burma-indo-border- market-threatened-by-indian-insurgents.html Category:Cities and towns in Chandel district Category:India‚ÄìMyanmar border crossings Category:Chandel, Manipur ","title":"Moreh, India"},{"id":"9851394","text":"High Steaks is a Tom and Jerry animated short film, released on March 23, 1962. It was the fourth of the thirteen cartoons in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. The short's title is a pun on the phrase \\"High stakes\\". Plot Tom's owner, Clint, is grilling steaks outside in his backyard. Jerry also hungers for some steaks and runs out of the basement to get to them, but Tom manages to stop him by trapping him with a fork. Tom then flings Jerry back into the basement, which makes him angry, and Jerry brings out his own fork to stab Tom with. The two engage in a fencing match with their forks; Tom misses every time, and accidentally stabs Clint in the butt with it, causing him to leap and yell in pain. After Tom nervously salutes him, Clint angrily sears Tom's head with a hot girdle, turning his head into a waffle. Then, he goes back to grilling his steak in fury. Later, Jerry next hides in a shuttlecock, trying to sneak onto the table, but Tom catches him and hits him with a racket. The shuttlecock bounces against the net and ricochets into Clint's mouth. Thinking that Tom threw the shuttlecock at him, the angry Clint grabs the racket and breaks it apart over Tom's head. Afterward, Jerry shakes up a bottle of Kooky Kola (which is a pun on the soda, Coca-Cola) soda and sprays it on one of Clint's steaks, ruining it completely. Thinking that Tom is responsible for the damage, Clint shakes up another bottle of Kooky Kola and force-feeds it to him as Tom gulps it, which turns him into a bottle. Jerry laughs at Tom's predicament, and the Tom once again chases Jerry. While Tom is searching for Jerry, Tom gets enamored with the aroma of the steam and goes up to the grill. Jerry, who was hiding behind the grill, places Tom's tail into the grill, causing Tom to scream in pain and run around wildly with the grill in tow. In the process, he smashes the table where Clint is eating steak, ruining his lunch and angering him further. Tom lands above the swimming pool with the heavy grill to cool off, but is unable to get out of the water due to the grill's weight. Clint, finally having had enough of Tom's shenanigans, yanks Tom up by his neck and pounds him for ruining his lunch. All the while Jerry hides under the picnic table covering his eyes with his hat. After the beatings are done, Clint ties Tom to a lawn chair to keep him out of trouble before storming off to cook some more steaks. Jerry then wheels the chair with Tom's hands tied to a wooden post out of the yard and attaches it to a car's bumper, and the car drives away with the chair, carrying the screaming, unconscious Tom with it. After that, Clint returns to his grilling in peace, while Jerry climbs up onto the table to steal and eat one of Clint's cooked steaks.

DEFA was the state owned film company of the GDR. The non- profit organization houses an extensive collection of 35mm and 16mm prints, dcps, DVDs, books, periodicals and articles. Students are involved in all aspects of the archive's research, outreach and teaching activities and also gain valuable non-academic experience in subtitling and library, conference and arts management. In order to fulfill its dual mission‚Äîto make DEFA films available and better known, and to broaden understanding of filmmaking in the GDR by interdisciplinary critical scholarship‚Äîthe DEFA Film Library undertakes a range of scholarly and support activities. About the DEFA Film Library =History= The DEFA Film Library at UMass Amherst was founded by Barton Byg, professor of film and German Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, in the late 1980s. The signing of an UMass memorandum on September 23, 1993 marks the DEFA Film Library's official founding. Byg's idea was to make films from the East German DEFA Studios more available and widely known in North America and to broaden popular and scholarly understanding of filmmaking in the GDR by critically exploring its aesthetic, political and ideological bases. DEFA stands for Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft. Founded a year after the end of World War II, it ultimately comprised a group of coordinated, state-run film studios, including, for example, the DEFA Feature and Documentary Film Studios, the Studio for Animation Films, etc. After the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, and German Reunification the following year, it was not clear what would happen to the over 7,500 DEFA films that had been made between 1946 and 1992, as the film rights had belonged to the now-defunct former GDR. As the post-unification fate of East Germany's film heritage was being decided across the Atlantic, the DEFA Film Library's collection grew bit by bit. In 1997, an agreement with two German partners ‚Äî Progress Film and the precursor to the DEFA Foundation ‚Äî brought a collection of East German film journals and the largest collection of 16mm and 35mm prints of DEFA films outside of Germany to the UMass Amherst campus. Also housed in the DEFA Film Library archive are 16mm prints that were donated by the US-GDR Friendship Committee and the former East German Embassy in addition to theatrical films, this part of the collection includes films that were made specifically to report on and represent the GDR overseas. In 1998, ICESTORM International Inc., which owned the international video rights for DEFA films, brought East German titles on video to North America. ICESTORM and the DEFA Film Library collaborated on the selection of 61 titles for the first U.S. release of subtitled DEFA films on video in 1999. On October 1, 2001, the DEFA Film Library took over the distribution of these titles for ICESTORM International. Since 2003, the DEFA Film Library has also been involved in subtitling and producing DEFA films for the North American market, in collaboration with ICESTORM and other licensors. =Circulating Print Archive= The DEFA Film Library's collection of theatrical film prints has now grown to almost 500 prints and have been screened at venues throughout North America, including: The Museum of Modern Art and the New York Jewish Film Festival in New York; the Harvard Film Archive and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the American Film Institute and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; the Toronto International Film Festival; the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio; Real Art Ways in Hartford, Connecticut; and Darkside Cinema in Corvallis, Oregon. Most visible have been large-scale touring film series that are co-curated by the DEFA Film Library and various partners and premiere at prestigious cultural institutions. In 2005, The Museum of Modern Art and the Goethe-Institut New York presented the most comprehensive retrospective of East German films ever screened in North America, Rebels with a Cause: The Cinema of East Germany. In 2009, a series commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall, WENDE FLICKS: Last Films from East Germany, premiered at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hammer Museum, the Wende Museum, UCLA and the Goethe-Institut Los Angeles. The DEFA Film Library has also curated and hosted the annual film festival at the German Studies Association conference since 2004. (For the list of curated film series, please see below.) =DVD releases with English subtitles= The DEFA Film Library's current DVD distribution catalog includes almost 100 (East) German titles, with 6‚Äì8 additional titles released every year. Its DVD line strives to complement films with high-quality bonus features and materials for educators. Highlight releases include: * Stars * Beethoven Duet * The Lost Angel * Arts in Exil * The Flying Dutchman * For Eyes Only * K√§the Kollwitz * the 2-DVD educators‚Äô set of Verdict on Auschwitz: The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial 1963‚Äì1965 (Dirs.

Slatan Dudow, 1932). =Research at the DEFA Film Library= The on-site research collection also includes over 1,000 DVDs and over 400 articles, books and periodicals (Filmspiegel, Kino DDR, Film und Fernsehen, epd Film, Deutsche Filmkunst). In addition, the Special Collections department at UMass Amherst's W.E.B. Du Bois Library owns the collection \\"Social Change and Movements for Social Change\\", which includes a Cold War Culture Collection with an emphasis on East Germany. =Programming for scholars= The DEFA Film Library supports an international network of scholars with a range of regular programming that has helped shape national and international research agendas on (East) German cinema. * In 1997 and 1999, DFL organized two international conferences on East German cinema in the Five College area, in collaboration with PROGRESS Film-Verleih and the DEFA Foundation in Berlin. It collaborated on a third international conference with the Academy for Film and Television in Potsdam-Babelsberg in November 2011. * Since 2001, the DEFA Film Library has hosted a week-long biennial Summer Film Institute for 25‚Äì30 researchers. Combining workshop discussions with screenings of a range of films‚Äîincluding little-known and rare titles‚Äîthe Institutes are known for their stimulation of new research topics. (For a list of Summer Film Institute topics, please see below.) * The DEFA Film Library organizes or participates in panels and panel series at national conferences. =Visiting Artists and Scholars= The DEFA Film Library Filmmaker's Tours bring German filmmakers to colleges, universities and cultural institutions throughout North America.

It is a formed, single layer shape that is made out of a non-conducting material, usually porcelain or glass. It is thought to be the earliest developed overhead insulator and is still popularly used in power networks up to 33 KV. Single or multiple pin insulators can be used on one physical support, however, the number of insulators used depends upon the application's voltage. Pin insulators are one of three types of overhead insulators, the others being strain insulators and suspension insulators. Unlike the others, pin insulators are directly connected to the physical support compared to being suspended from the wire. Pin insulators are shaped to allow the secure attachment of the conducting wire and avoid it coming adrift. The wire is usually attached to the insulator by being wrapped around it or in other circumstances, fixed into grooves on the insulator itself. When an insulator is wet, its outer surface becomes conducting making the insulator less effective. An insulator has an umbrella-like design so that it can protect the lower part of the insulator from rain. To keep the inner side of the insulator dry, ridges around the insulator, \\"rain sheds\\", are made. These increase the creepage distance from the energized wire to the mounting pin.  Collecting  Pin insulators have become collectible items. All glass pin insulators are assigned a Consolidated Design (CD) number, a system first implemented by hobbyist N.R. Woodward in 1954. Each CD number corresponds to a specific glass style, shape, or manufacturer. CD numbers are only hobby-specific for collectors, and are not used or recognised by insulator manufacturers. Insulators, at the time of manufacturing, were simply viewed as an engineering product and were not meant to be an entertainment product for spectators. This meant that the quality of the insulators was not a primary concern of the manufacturers that made them. The finished product was usually discoloured from impurities and foreign objects diffused within the molten glass and metal molds. These impurities give the insulator a unique character and high value as collectors would rather obtain an imperfect product rather than a perfect, common product. Impurities in the glass can create amber swirls, milk swirls, graphite inclusions, and two or three-tone insulators. Foreign objects contained within the glass are known to be nails, pennies, and screws. Although glass insulators are the most popular for the majority of collectors, a number of people collect porcelain insulators as well. These also come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.  Manufacturers  A sparkling CD 145 or \\"beehive\\" insulator from the telegraph era made by the Brookfield Glass Company circa 1882. The same snowy CREB 145 sitting on its side One of the major U.S. manufacturers that produced glass insulators during the 19th century and early 20th century in the USA was Brookfield Glass Company. It can be assumed that Brookfield may have had poor quality control as their insulators seem to be found with the most imperfections, however, this could be disputed. Another major U.S. manufacturer that produced glass insulators was the Hemingray Glass Company. They were known for producing the most variety of colors. Some examples of colors that the company produced are yellow, golden yellow, butterscotch, glowing orange, amber, whiskey amber, \\"root beer\\" amber, orange-amber, red-amber, oxblood, green, lime green, sage green, depression green, emerald green, olive green, yellow-olive green, aqua, cornflower blue, electric blue, cobalt blue, sapphire blue, glowing peacock blue, and many others. Different colors were produced to allow two or more different utility companies to quickly identify which wires were theirs by the color of insulator if multiple wires were strung over the same utility pole. For example, one company may have a string of amber insulators, while another, on the same poles, might have their insulators in cobalt blue. There are many manufacturers in the United States, Canada, and other countries that can be found embossed on all styles of insulators.

Emotion robots learn from people. Retrieved on March 4, 2007. The robots are designed to respond to emotional cues from humans and use them to adapt their own behavior. The project designers wanted to facilitate integration of robots into human society so that they could more easily provide services. The project aims to create robots that can \\"recognize\\" a given emotion, such as anger or fear, in a human, and adapt its behavior to the most appropriate response after repeated interactions.Kate Wighton. March 3, 2007. Robo-doc‚Äôs on call today. Times Online. Retrieved on March 5, 2007. Thus the project emphasizes development over time. Robots are expected to be able to read emotions by picking up on physical cues like movement of body and facial muscles, posture, speed of movement, eyebrow position, and distance between the human and the robot. Project participants want to design the robots to detect those emotional cues that are universal to people, rather than those specific to individuals and cultures. The robots are made not only to detect emotions in people but also to have their own. According to Dr. Lola Ca√±amero, who is running the project, \\"Emotions foster adaptation to environment, so robots would be better at learning things. For example, anything that damages the body would be painful, so a robot would learn not to do it again.\\" Ca√±amero says that the robots will be given the equivalent of a system of pleasure and pain. The robots will have artificial neural networks. Rather than building complex hardware, the project coordinators plan to focus on designing software and to use mostly \\"off the shelf\\" hardware that is already available. The only part they plan to build themselves are heads with artificial faces capable of forming facial expressions. The scheme for 2.5 million euros is financed by the European Commission (the executive body of the European Union) and is set to last for three years. Project participants hope to have a model of robot that can be used in homes and hospitals by the scheduled end date of the project.

In the twelfth century, Archbishop Pierre mentioned, 'Castrum Santi - Cannati' in a paper. In the thirteenth century, villagers turned on their archbishop and pledged allegiance to the Lord of the Baux-de-Provence, and then to the Kings of Sicily (namely, Frederic III of Aragon, or perhaps Louis XIII). This, however, only lasted three years. In the same century, the Knights Templar established a settlement there. Pierre Andr√© de Suffren was born here on 17 July 1729. A century later, Alphonse Tavernier, a poet, was born here on 27 November 1852. On June 11, 1909, a terrible earthquake destroyed almost everything. Shortly after, the houses were re-built in the same architectural style. Both in 1984 and 1994 huge floods ravaged most houses.

Lirwani agents launch a covert strike to abduct Tess and assassinate the King and Queen. These events take place while Wren is on vacation in Alat Los.

Whitehead was a marketing maverick who used an innovative memorable 10-second television commercial to sell Blue Star Ointment. These shorter ads cost less than a traditional 30-second commercial to both produce and air. Whitehead packed all the information into a shorter time frame to attract customers through the old marketing format of an auctioneer. Biography Whitehead was born in Fort Morgan in northeastern Colorado. His mother's family traces their roots to the pre-Revolutionary War period. Robert Whitehead's daughters are still both affiliated with the Daughters of the American Revolution. Whitehead's father, Dan, was a third-generation cattle broker and an auctioneer. Whitehead said that much of his early business success came from his father's direction. In 1882, Dan Whitehead's family established the town of Oakland in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. Whitehead began his sales career with the Gail Borden Company in New York City; he moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to accept a sales director position with Amalie Oil Company. Later, he founded Quaker Products from his home in Houston and obtained the rights to distribute Blue Star Ointment, which became his firm's primary product; Quaker Products also offered a cleaner for steam irons. Whitehead often remarked that Blue Star Ointment successfully treated his painful psoriasis, which he suffered with since his teenage years. The product also offers relief from various types of itching from eczema to insect bites, ringworm, jock itch, and athlete's foot. Blue Star's original formula was created in the 1920s by the apothecary and pharmacist Adolf Gottlieb, a German immigrant. Gottlieb sold his Blue Star formula in the 1930s to traveling salesman Jim Bourland of Fort Worth, Texas. When Bourland died, Robert Whitehead acquired the rights thereafter, and sales began to skyrocket. Whitehead's older son, Henry Whitehead, and daughter Gail Whitehead assisted him in the family-owned and operated business.

The story, screenplay and direction are by Kushan Nandy; dialogues by Ashish Deo. The film is a murder mystery and is loosely based on James Hadley Chase's novel Tiger By The Tail.  Plot  The film opens with the brutal murder of Neeraj Shah (Sachin Dubey). His body is dumped in the trunk of a car. This crime isn't committed on impulse: Whoever did it had good reason. We then enter the life of a bank executive Pratyush Shelar (Atul Kulkarni). He gets home late on his anniversary because he had to console an old college classmate about her marital woes. His own marital woes are worsened when his wife Antara (Suchitra Pillai) kicks up a big fight and leaves their home with their daughter Saanjh. Pratyush is upset about this. His colleague Aslam Durrani (Harsh Khurana) picks up on this and suggests an exotic dancer Teesta (Shweta Menon). Pratyush is too upset to be interested. But Aslam is determined; later that night he calls Pratyush and pretends as though some thugs are about to kill him. He asks Pratyush to come immediately to a certain location. That location is 88 Antop Hill. Pratyush arrives. 88 Antop Hill is a halfway house mainly occupied by exotic dancers and escorts. Pratyush walks into the flat Aslam had mentioned; it is Teesta's lair. She attempts to seduce him but he refuses her advances. Upon her request, he takes her to the Moksha club and buys her a drink. (He doesn't drink.) She remarks that the bartender Sol (Rahul Panday) knows all her secrets. While leaving the bar, their car is attacked by an apparently drunk man, who seems to know Teesta. Teesta urges Pratyush to leave fast. When he brings her back home, he realizes that his car keys are missing. He waits as she looks for them. When Teesta gets into her bedroom, she is mysteriously murdered. She stumbles into Pratyush's arms, fatally stabbed, and collapses. Scared and confused, Pratyush leaves immediately. One of the neighbors, a weird and on-and-off senile old fellow called Murli Mansukhani (Shauket Baig) sees him leave. When the cops begin to investigate, they find that Teesta had a roommate Sonali (Jasmine) and that Sonali is engaged to a prominent businessman, K.K. Menon (Sanjay Singh). The investigating officer, and the hero of this movie, Inspector Arvind Khanvilkar (Rahul Dev), starts his work. The prime suspect is an unwitting Pratyush because he was the last person to see Teesta alive. A somewhat convoluted plot evolves. Sonali has several dark secrets and a good-for-nothing brother Prashant (Subrat Dutta). Teesta was somehow connected to Sonali's dark past. Menon knows this and wanted to wipe out everything, including Prashant. He has Prashant kidnapped, and later he tells Sol to bump off Prashant. There is a three-way fight among them. Pratyush arrives upon the scene and witnesses two more murders. A dying Prashant advises Pratyush to go to Sonali at the earliest. In the meantime, the weird old man of 88 Antop Hill, Murli, recalls that he had seen Pratyush and follows him to blackmail him. When Pratyush asks him to get lost, he goes to Sonali's house and tries to blackmail her. Aslam Durrani visits Pratyush and, seeing him, thinks he has probably committed the crime, saying that Pratyush would better leave the city and that he wouldn't want anything to do with the latter anymore. Pratyush contacts the cops but a dimwitted cop sternly asks him to surrender, as the police have found the murder weapon and a blood stained shirt, with Pratyush's diary stating 88 Antop Hill on the fateful date at his house. Pratyush panics and goes to Sonali to convey Prashant's message to her. She does not listen to what he says. Here Menon and the good inspector show up as well. The crux arises -- the inspector says that he has found out that Sonali is actually \\"Sonali Shah\\", and she was married already to the deceased Neeraj Shah; it was Sonali who killed him because he wouldn't give her a divorce to marry Menon. He also says that Neeraj's house was ransacked by Sonali to find the marriage certificate. Arvind goes to the fridge and finds Murli Mansukhani lying stabbed in it! The truth is then out. It is known that Sonali murdered Neeraj and hid his corpse in the fridge and murdered Murli because he opened the fridge out of curiosity and found Neeraj's corpse. Arvind also reveals that Sonali killed Teesta. Sonali says it was because Teesta knew about her marriage with Neeraj, and used to blackmail her, saying she will make it known to Menon. It was Sonali who had followed Pratyush and Teesata on the fateful night back to 88 Antop Hill, secretly climbed into Teesta's bedroom and slit her throat. She further followed Pratyush and leaves the knife in his house to implicate him. It is then revealed that Menon has murdered Prashant, at which Sonali is shocked. Menon makes a last effort to save himself and Sonali. He tries to bribe Arvind with 10 million, saying that he must arrest poor Pratyush on charges of all the murders. To this, Arvind agrees and shoots Pratyush in the shoulder. But the wounded Pratyush releases gas from the cylinder nearby and threatens to light his cigarette lighter. While he grabs Arvind's phone and tries to call police, Menon attacks him and stabs him on the sofa, and Arvind quickly turns out the gas. But the wounded Pratyush pulls out Menon's revolver, kicks him off and shoots him through a cushion. A dumbfounded Sonali picks up a pistol and threatens to kill Pratyush. Arvind tells her not to, but she pulls the trigger -- only to find that the gun is empty. Arvind then apologizes to Pratyush, saying he had to wound the latter or else Menon would've killed Pratyush. Sonali is then arrested on charges of multiple homicide and attempt to kill Pratyush. The film ends with the inspector relieving Pratyush of all charges in the case and requesting him to take care of a pet dog. Pratyush's wife and child return.

It was developed by Dutch company VSTEP and released by the former company Lighthouse Interactive, which closed down in 2009. Ship Simulator 2006 The first version of Ship Simulator was released in 2006 and was titled Ship Simulator 2006. The user can steer various ships, amongst others a Rotterdam water taxi, a container ship and even the ill-fated RMS Titanic, in various weather conditions and in three real-life harbours, which are Rotterdam, Hamburg and Phi Phi Islands in Thailand; a fourth harbour, New York City was later released as a free download. A game element is added to the simulation by means of forty \\"missions\\" which have to be completed as fast or as accurately as possible. Users can also design their own missions, and share with others. The game has a built-in scenario editor to create new missions. The Official Ship Simulator 2006 Add-On was released in February 2007. This is an expansion pack with six additional ships and extra features such as ship walk-throughs.  Series  Ship Simulator 2008 released in July 2007 in Germany and the UK. It contains seven ports and eight open sea environments. This version also features waves, weather, day/night time transitions, damage to vessels, and new boats and ships. There are six new ships; a supertanker, a Solent ferry, large ocean ferry, a new patrol boat and two new tugs. There is also a Ship Simulator Professional V2.0 The Titanic has also undergone some minor changes for example the second class stairwell and the stern section are visitable, as well and the original ships have been updated. Free add-ons were reportedly available, including a hovercraft, jetski, barge, improved physics and possibly another environment. An official expansion for Ship Simulator 2008 titled Ship Simulator 2008 New Horizons was released in April, 2008. The add- on features eight new ships, the addition of multiplayer functionality, a new sailing area (Padstow, Cornwall), twenty new missions, in game downloading of new missions, option to connect and disconnect barges to the pushboat in-game, and new walkthrough options. Ship Simulator Extremes is the name of the latest installment in the Ship Simulator series. It was released on August 27, 2010. Additions to the game include new locations around the world from cold Antarctica to warm Bora Bora as well as new ships (including official licensed Greenpeace vessels) and new dynamic and more realistic weather and water systems. Most vessels from Ship Simulator 2008 are also part of the choice of ships. The cruise ship \\"Ocean Star\\" from Ship Simulator 2006/2008 is also included, except outside colors have changed and the name changed to \\"Orient Star\\". Vessels have more usable controls and more realistic ones, unlike Ship Simulator 2008 in which only the whistle, binoculars, thrust, rudder and thrusters (if applicable on the vessel) are usable, although you can listen to the ship's radio but not send out calls. Sinking dynamics and physics have also improved in Ship Simulator Extremes. Also unlike Ship Simulator 2008, you can launch lifeboats/motorboats off a suitably vessel. Following a campaign by members of their growing fanbase, VSTEP agreed to include the ports of Dover and Calais (in one environment).To celebrate the first anniversary of Ship Simulator Extreme a new pilot boat. The game has been criticized for not being able to run on Mac OS and very powerful computers for no reason, requiring high graphical performance and like its predecessors not being able to use your own ships. Peripherals A \\"ship control unit\\", designed specifically for Ship Simulator and enabling more realistic steering, was released in 2006 by Wilco Publishing. P.I. Engineering have announced \\"ShipDriver\\", a marine simulation controller based on their RailDriver train controller for Auran's Trainz and Microsoft's Train Simulator. ShipDriver released in winter 2010. Critical reception Ship Simulator has been criticised for limitations in the replication of realistic controls and the lack of open architecture preventing users from creating their own vehicles and voyages. \\"Slow and mundane gameplay\\" and bugs have also been cited. Reviewers did comment that the game is challenging and that it has educational value. In addition, reviewers also praised the attention to detail for the scenery and boats.

Its studios are located on Plumb Lane in South Reno, and its transmitter is located on McClellan Peak northeast of Carson City, Nevada. History KNEV is the longest continuously operating FM station in the state of Nevada, having signed on Christmas Day 1953. Since its original air date in 1953, KNEV has maintained its original call sign and frequency. KNEV was originally an easy listening station during the daytime and classical after 6 PM and all day on Sundays and remained that way for many years. In 1980, Everett Cobb sold the station to McClatchy Newspapers. In 1992, the station was relaunched as \\"Magic 95\\", with a soft adult contemporary format, and would compete with crosstown station KRNO (Sunny 106.9). In 1995, the station shifted towards a hot AC format, while retaining the \\"Magic\\" branding. The 1970s songs were dropped from the playlist as the station focused on hits from the 1980s and 1990s. In 2001, Magic rebranded as \\"Mix 95.5\\" and became an adult top 40 station. In November 2004, the station flipped to an all-Christmas format and brought back the \\"Magic\\" branding.

It was proposed by Virginia Ragsdale in her dissertation in 1906 and was disproved in 1979. It has been called \\"the oldest and most famous conjecture on the topology of real algebraic curves\\". Formulation of the conjecture Ragsdale's dissertation, \\"On the Arrangement of the Real Branches of Plane Algebraic Curves,\\" was published by the American Journal of Mathematics in 1906. The dissertation was a treatment of Hilbert's sixteenth problem, which had been proposed by Hilbert in 1900, along with 22 other unsolved problems of the 19th century; it is one of the handful of Hilbert's problems that remains wholly unresolved. Ragsdale formulated a conjecture that provided an upper bound on the number of topological circles of a certain type, along with the basis of evidence. Conjecture Ragsdale's main conjecture is as follows. Assume that an algebraic curve of degree 2k contains p even and n odd ovals. Ragsdale conjectured that : p \\\\le \\\\tfrac32 k(k-1) + 1 \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad n \\\\le \\\\tfrac32 k(k-1). She also posed the inequality :  2(p-n)-1  \\\\le 3k^2 - 3k + 1, and showed that the inequality could not be further improved. This inequality was later proved by Petrovsky. Disproving the conjecture The conjecture was held of very high importance in the field of real algebraic geometry for most of the twentieth century. Later, in 1980, Oleg Viro Translated in introduced a technique known as \\"patchworking algebraic curves\\" and used to generate a counterexample to the conjecture. In 1993, Ilia Itenberg produced additional counterexamples to the Ragsdale conjecture, so Viro and Itenberg wrote a paper in 1996 discussing their work on disproving the conjecture using the \\"patchworking\\" technique. The problem of finding a sharp upper bound remains unsolved.

It is owned by Michigan State University, and is sister station to the AM radio and television stations with the same call letters. The station airs classical music, and several of National Public Radio's more popular programs, such as Morning Edition, Weekend Edition, All Things Considered and Car Talk. In January 2013, WKAR launched the daily news/arts radio magazine Current State, an hour-long program of interviews and produced reports devoted Mid-Michigan and statewide politics, government, business, education, environment, science, technology, health, medicine and the arts. The program is broadcast Monday through Friday at 9 am and 6 pm on 90.5 FM and weekdays at noon on AM 870. Current State Weekend airs Saturdays and Sundays on both 90.5 FM and AM 870. The station is also the primary Emergency Alert System (EAS) station for the state of Michigan, relaying emergency messages from the Michigan State Police to all media outlets in Michigan; WKAR-FM hosts statewide tests twice a year. WKAR-FM is also the secondary EAS station for Lansing and the South Central Michigan region (WFMK is the primary station for the region). The station signed on for the first time on October 4, 1948 as the Lansing area's first FM station. Like most FM stations of the time, it simulcast its AM sister for several years during the AM station's sunrise to sunset broadcast hours. When WKAR-AM concluded its broadcast hours for the day, WKAR-FM would then carry its own signature programming which included classical music and other arts-related programs. The two stations split their broadcasting schedules on March 1, 1965, with the FM station airing fine arts programming. The WKAR stations were charter members of NPR in 1971, and were among the 90 stations to carry the inaugural broadcast of All Things Considered. The station's 85,000-watt signal, combined with a 269.3 meter antenna can be heard as far east as Flint and the Detroit suburbs, and as far west as Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. WKAR- FM is a \\"Superpower Grandfathered\\" Class B FM station, providing a signal 7.6 dB stronger than would be granted today under current U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules. HD programming WKAR-FM is licensed by the FCC to broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format, on the following HD channels: HD1 provides a simulcast of the analog FM signal's NPR and classical music format. HD2 is a simulcast of the Classical 24 classical music channel. HD3 is a simulcast of WKAR (870 AM), continuing from local sunset to sunrise when the AM station is not broadcasting. It is also simulcast on a low-powered translator at 105.1 FM, giving most of the Lansing area access to a locally focused NPR news and talk station. In addition to its HD signals, WKAR-FM also has streams on its website of folk music, jazz, and Radio Reading Service. Its three HD signals are also streaming online. As of June 30, 2017, WKAR-FM has discontinued HD Radio services.

M√©nestrier was born in Lyon. He composed numerous books on heraldry, in which he was one of the greatest authorities of his age, the professor of the colleges in Chamb√©ry, Vienne, Grenoble, and Lyon. During 1669-70 he traveled to Germany and Italy, but reached Paris and lived there to his death. He was the most widely known heraldist of his time, and was from 1622 in close correspondence with Philipp Jakob Spener, the founder of the German scientific heraldry who refused the merely symbolic interpretation of arms. M√©nestrier maintained that we can know the essence of heraldry only from the sources from the age of living heraldry but he was also influenced by the heraldic view of his age. Thus, his researches were abortive. M√©nestrier's essays \\"On Ancient and Modern Musical Productions\\" (Des Repr√©sentations en musique anciennes et modernes, 1681) and \\"On Ancient and Modern Ballets, After The Rules of Theatre\\" (Des Ballets anciens et modernes selon les r√®gles du th√©√¢tre, 1682) were influential in the development of ballet as a dramatic concert dance style capable of expressing a wide range of emotion and narrating a complex story, drawing upon accounts of ancient Roman pantomime.Alessandra Zanobi, Ancient Pantomime and its Reception, Oxford University Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama M√©nestrier was also a numismatist and antiquary. In 1689 he published his Histoire du Roy Louis le Grand par les m√©dailles. embl√™mes, devises, jettons, inscriptions, armoiries, et autres monumens publics. The book was the first antiquarian history of a modern individual, and largely used medals drawn from the collection of P√®re Fran√ßois de la Chaise.

Jos√© Manuel Torres Yake, a 33-year-old Japanese Peruvian wanted for child sexual abuse in Peru, was arrested and charged with Airi's murder a week later. Torres was convicted and sentenced to life without parole in July 2006. Murder On Tuesday 22 November 2005, Airi Kinoshita, a seven-year-old elementary school student from Hiroshima, disappeared on her way home from school. At 5 p.m. that day, a local resident discovered Airi's corpse in a tape-bound cardboard box in a vacant lot in Hiroshima's Aki Ward. Injuries were found on her lower body that suggested she had been sexually assaulted. Airi's randoseru was later found alongside a road about 300 meters away, and had been carrying a so-called \\"crime prevention buzzer\\" but it was missing when her body was found. Around 300 people attended Airi's funeral in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, her father Kenichi's hometown, with many mourners including Ground Self-Defense Force members who served with her father, a soldier. Kenichi Kinoshita stated: \\"I was deeply shocked when I was told by police that she was probably murdered,\\" her father said in an address during the funeral. \\"I feel animosity toward the person who committed the crime. I hope the culprit is caught soon.\\" The Hiroshima Prefectural Police said they suspected Airi's killer had lured her away as she was walking home and then killed her soon afterwards. An autopsy confirmed that Airi had been murdered within 90 minutes of leaving school, around lunchtime between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., and had died of suffocation caused by pressure to the neck. Police investigators learned that the box Airi was found in had been used as packaging for an oven sold at a home improvement store in Higashi Ward. Arrest and trial By 29 November, the police sought the arrest of Jos√© Manuel Torres Yake, a 33-year-old Japanese Peruvian who lived in an apartment in Hiroshima near where Airi's body was found. On 30 November, Japanese police arrested Torres at a relative's house in Suzuka, Mie Prefecture. Torres had illegally immigrated to Japan from Peru in April 2004 on a work visa using the false name Juan Carlos Pizarro Yagi and claiming to be 30-years-old, and relocated from Mie Prefecture to Hiroshima Prefecture in mid-2005. Japanese police discovered that Torres was wanted in Peru for multiple charges of child sexual abuse. Airi's murder had attracted attention from the Japanese mass media, and at first her real name was reported. However, when it was revealed that Airi had been sexually assaulted, the Japanese media stopped using her real name. Despite this, Airi's relatives wanted her real name to be reported. On June 26, 2006, her father Kenichi said: After this speech, Japanese mass media resumed reporting Airi's real name. The speech made the name Airi Kinoshita famous in Japan. On July 4, 2006, the Hiroshima District Court sentenced Torres to life imprisonment for sexually assaulting and killing the girl, citing his haphazardness. He had dumped the girl's body close to his apartment. Prosecutors appealed against the leniency of the sentence, demanding the death penalty. On December 9, 2008, the Hiroshima High Court reversed and remanded the original verdict. However, the Supreme Court of Japan demanded them to continue his trial. The Hiroshima High Court upheld the life sentence, resulting in the end of his trial because they had not submitted an additional appeal by August 12, 2010. Reaction Airi Kinoshita's death caused a moral panic among parents in Japan, which had been thought to be a \\"safe society\\", and led to greater suspicion against otaku subculture in the country. The Japanese media had suspected that the criminal was an otaku while Airi's murder was still being investigated, though Torres' arrest and conviction proved this to be false. The panic against otaku had existed in Japan since the arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki in Tokyo in 1989, and was heightened by the arrest of Kaoru Kobayashi in Osaka a year earlier. Similar to Torres, both Miyazaki and Kobayashi had raped and murdered young girls around Airi Kinoshita's age and were well-publicized as otaku, although there was little-to-no evidence of them being otaku. Torres' charges of child sexual abuse in Peru meant the incident also had influence in Latin America. A journalist, Kent Paterson, indicated Torres into debates of femicides in Latin America.

It is a part of St. Bernard Parish Public Schools. Chalmette High School opened in 1954 at the current site of Chalmette Elementary School, previously known as Chalmette Middle School. In 1962, the school moved to the current location on the corner of Palmisano Avenue and Judge Perez Drive. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina flooded the school, which was being used as an emergency shelter, along with the rest of the Greater New Orleans area. Chalmette High hosted the St. Bernard Unified School, before reopening as Chalmette High School for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. In 2009, U.S. News magazine released its rankings of the best high schools in America, based on test scores and other factors. Chalmette earned a bronze medal as one of 39 schools in Louisiana to make the list. History The history of Chalmette High School began in 1926 with the addition of a freshman class to Meraux Elementary School. It is believed that an additional grade level was added each of three subsequent years until a four-year institution could be established. Prior to 1926, any student wanting a high school diploma had to transfer to an Orleans Parish Public School. Orleans Parish agreed to educate any secondary student from St. Bernard for a nominal annual fee, which was paid by St. Bernard Parish School Board. The first high school in St. Bernard Parish was named Joseph Maumas High School and was located on Friscoville Street in Old Arabi. Sometime during the 1930s, the name was changed to Arabi High School. The school acquired its present nickname from an owl figurine that hung above the school entrance. The figurine was lost, but the nickname lives on. In 1954, Arabi High School changed its name to Chalmette Senior High School as it moved to the site of the current Chalmette Elementary School. A new facility was constructed further \\"down the road\\" at the corner of (then Goodchildren) Judge Perez and Palmisano, and Chalmette Senior High moved there in 1962. St. Bernard High was opened in the early 1950s and served the lower end of St. Bernard Parish. In the fall of 1966, Chalmette High School became an all-boys high school. This helped meet the demand of more classrooms to house the ever growing school population. The solution to the problem of having four co-ed high schools was to segregate by sex. This would cut costs drastically since the parish would only have to build and maintain two stadiums instead of four. Andrew Jackson High School and PGT Beauregard High School served girls for the next 22 years, and they became the \\"sister\\" schools to Chalmette and St. Bernard respectively. During the 1968‚Äì1969 term, the school's name was officially changed to Chalmette High School, but the sign outside the front door still had \\"Senior\\" on it until the most recent renovations in In 1970, the Owls joined the New Orleans Catholic League, in the LHSAA's new class 4A. Though the Owls never won it in football, they were more than a match for their district foes, and this time period is remembered by many as the heyday of the school. In 1974, a Chalmette student let loose a canister of teargas under the football stadium during the rivalry game with Holy Cross. In 1978, they played eventual state champion St. Augustine for a share of the Catholic League championship, and lost 20‚Äì19 in front of a still school-record crowd of 14,000 on their campus. Back then, there were no \\"wild cards\\" in the LHSAA state football playoffs, so the Owls missed the state playoffs with what could have been one of the top teams in the state. The year 1971 brought construction to Chalmette High. As the school population grew, more space was needed. An addition was built that is still referred to as \\"the new building.\\" The school grew to a high of 1,600 boys in the 1970s, but shrank with the opening of Meraux Catholic school Archbishop Hannan High School in 1985. That and the decision to go back to co-ed status in 1989 brought about a mild decline in the school. More students were choosing to attend Andrew Jackson, a magnet school that served the entire parish, rather than just the upper end. Chalmette left the Catholic League football district after the 1988 season. Chalmette High stayed between 700 and 900 students for the next 15 years, as their academic ratings stayed stable and their sports teams saw moderate success in class 4A, now no longer the highest classification. Their classification briefly dipped to 3A in the early 2000s. In this brief period, they and St. Bernard were in the same LHSAA district. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina changed everything. The parish was completely devastated, and St. Bernard Parish leaders saw an opportunity to rebuild bigger and better. The St. Bernard Parish school board opened a school in trailers set up in the stadium parking lot in November 2005 and welcomed 334 students from kindergarten to 12th grade on its first day. Chalmette High School played temporarily under the St. Bernard Unified School banner in its sports. By the springtime, the main building on Judge Perez had been repaired. As the parish struggled with difficult decisions in the aftermath of Katrina, they decided Chalmette High School would be the only one to rebuild after the storm. Archbishop Hannan was relocated to the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain by the Archdiocese. Andrew Jackson and St. Bernard were eventually converted into middle schools. Even rival Holy Cross relocated from their lower 9th ward campus to a new site on Paris Avenue, in Gentilly. As St. Bernard Parish started to repopulate, Chalmette High School joined LHSAA class 5A for the first time in its history for the 2007 football season, and rejoined the Catholic League. The school is undergoing a transformation, with the freshman academy across Judge Perez at the former Lacoste Elementary, the Cultural Arts Center and St. Bernard Public Library next door, field houses for both the football and baseball teams, the stadiums renovated with artificial turf added, and a skywalk over Judge Perez Drive connecting the two campuses done. In 2015, a new school library, and administrative offices were completed. Chalmette High hit an important milestone in 2012, as they received an \\"A\\" rating from the state of Louisiana for their school performance score. Athletics Chalmette takes great pride in its athletics program. The athletic programs continue to strive towards achieving the goal of an LHSAA state championship, which has never been won in the school's history. The Owls have bounced between districts in their history, with their longest stay in one district being from 12 B.C ‚Äì1988, in the famed New Orleans Catholic League. Due to the closure of St. Bernard and Andrew Jackson High Schools and the re-locations of Archbishop Hannan and Holy Cross, Chalmette became the only High School in St. Bernard Parish, thus moving the school to class 5A, the highest classification of the LHSAA, for the first time in 2007. The Owls retain a rivalry against Holy Cross from their Catholic League days and have played 47 times in football since 1967, HC leading 33-11-3. Notable meetings include the Owls' first state playoff game in 1776, three straight ties between 1973 and 1975, and a 41‚Äì6 defeat of the Tigers in 2003 which set the stage for an undefeated regular season. Chalmette was undefeated all-time against St. Bernard High, and split the series against Hannan while they were located in St. Bernard, 3-3, playing from 1997 through 2002. In 2013, the Owls joined district 8-5A consisting of mostly Jefferson Parish Public Schools. Alumni There are quite a number of successful people who reign from Chalmette. Norris Weese, a former quarterback of the Fighting Owl Football Team, led Chalmette to the 1968 state semi-finals and later played for the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XII, held in the Louisiana Superdome. Weese's Owls lost in the 1968 semifinals to Shreveport Woodlawn, led by future Arkansas and Buffalo Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson. Ronnie Lamarque is a locally famous automobile dealer. Walter Boasso is a successful businessman, former state senator, and a 2007 candidate for governor of Louisiana. Mike Romano is Chalmette's most recent major league athlete, having pitched three games for the 1999 Toronto Blue Jays. Jane Boisseau (1963) graduated from NYU law school, was a partner at a worldwide law firm based in New York City, and was selected one of the USA's Best Lawyers. Charles Perniciaro, M.D. (1974) is an internationally recognized dermatologist and dermatopathologist who has published over 50 medical articles and book chapters. William Wei (2015) graduated from Tulane University and is an energy investment banker at a firm based in New York City Mitchell Robinson of the class of 2017, became Chalmette's first McDonald's All-American basketball player and also played in the Jordan Brand Classic. He was committed to play at Western Kentucky University before deciding to simply train for the 2018 NBA Draft. He was selected with the 36th pick in the 2018 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks Cultural Arts Center A modernist, pillared cultural arts building opened at Chalmette High School in 2011. Clad in brick, stainless steel panels and cement plaster, and complete with a glass atrium lobby, the $28.7 million building on East Judge Perez Drive features a 420-seat theater as its centerpiece. It was paid for through FEMA and Community Development Block Grant funds and private donations. Designed by Waggonner & Ball Architects of New Orleans and constructed by Mapp Construction of Baton Rouge, work began in March 2009 and was substantially completed by December. It includes a public library on the first floor, fronting Judge Perez Drive. In addition to the larger theater, there is a 120-seat technology center that has a large cinema screen. Students can plug in laptops at their seats while listening to lectures. Upstairs, there is a choral room, two practice rooms and an instrumental music ensemble room, each soundproof and equipped with recording equipment. There are two dance studios, one that has the same dimensions as the large theater's stage, thereby providing students with a separate practice space. The large theater is designed with acoustics in the forefront, according to its architect, David Waggonner. It sports a classic proscenium arch, an orchestra pit, and a fly loft that will allow students to hoist scenery and lights. A student-run coffee shop will provide concessions during shows. Ninth Grade Academy In 2009, construction was completed on a new building designed by LACHIN Architects, APC across Judge Perez Drive. The complex, across from the main campus, includes a 3-story classroom building, a new gymnasium, a 25-yard indoor swimming pool, a wrestling arena, and a fitness center. The Academy is home to approximately 600 freshmen. The facility was built around research-based practices that recommend 9th-grade academies as a way to stem the drop-out tide that seems to hit 9th-graders across the nation. The program divides students into 3 cohorts of about 200 students who are served by the same 6-8 teachers. The school provides tutoring to students during lunch and after school. In addition, students who choose not to complete assignments or who may choose to complete them without the best effort are required to attend tutoring sessions until work is completed. The Chalmette High School Lacoste Campus complex will also house the school's Cultural Arts facility. That building, completed in November 2010, will feature a dance studio, music and choral studios, a performance theater, and a 9th-grade library emphasizing cultural arts. The facility will also house a branch of the public library. Demographics In 2019, 52% of the students came from racial and ethnic minorities; the numbers of minorities increased as a result of post-Hurricane Katrina population shifts. Extracurricular activities Bobby Nuss Stadium Bobby Nuss Stadium is Chalmette's football, soccer, and track and field stadium. The stadium became officially named on November 1, 1991, in a pre-game ceremony. The stadium was named after Bobby Nuss, a longtime Chalmette football coach who died of a heart attack the year prior to the ceremony. The stadium's former name was Noel Suarez Stadium, which is now the name of the Owls' baseball field, next door to Nuss Stadium. Many memorable moments in Chalmette's athletic history have occurred in the stadium. In 2001, the New Orleans' area single game rushing record was broken twice in a three-week span, both times at Nuss Stadium. In addition to this accomplishment, the Owls Football Team completed a 10-0 regular season, their first ever and only one to date, in 2003. Chalmette football has won district championships in 1961, 1968, 1992, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, and most recently in 2015, but has won multiple playoff games only once, in 1968, when they made it to the state semifinals. The stadium was flooded as a result of Hurricane Katrina but was repaired in time for the 2006 football season. Its reopening was compared to the New Orleans Saints reopening of the Louisiana Superdome. For the 2008 football season, artificial turf and a new scoreboard with a messaging board were added. The stadium seats approximately 8,000, with concession stands on both sides. A new press box, twice the size of the old one, was completed for 2011. In 2012, Chalmette High unveiled the finest football fieldhouse in the state of Louisiana. Designed by LACHIN Architects, APC, the first floor features a locker room, coaches' offices, art classrooms, gym, and a storage area. The second floor has meeting rooms, the weight room, a media room, a running track above the gym, and overlooks the field, giving a great view of the action. Several movie projects have utilized Chalmette High's football stadium, such as 2012's The Campaign, starring Will Ferrell, and When the Game Stands Tall, released in August 2014. Chalmette High School original gym Voted one of the top ten gyms in the state of Louisiana, Chalmette's gym seats approximately 1100 in wooden chairback seats and was a location for the filming of Hurricane Season and Glory Road, as well as commercials featuring Michael Jordan and Chris Paul. Chalmette boys' basketball has three LHSAA state semifinal appearances: in 1984, 1985, and 2017. The girls' basketball team was state runner-up in 1991. Noel Suarez Stadium Noel Suarez Stadium is the baseball stadium at Chalmette High School. A new scoreboard was added in 2008, along with the new football scoreboard. The stadium seats approximately 500 and is distinctive for how close the fans are to the action, as well as the odd shape of the outfield and high fences, necessitated by the running track of the football stadium. The deepest parts of the outfield are left-center and right-center field, but straightaway center is closer to home plate than both foul poles. For the 2011 season, artificial turf was added, and an indoor batting cage and clubhouse was constructed next to the stadium. A new press box and concession stand were constructed, making a concourse on the last row of the stadium. New individual plastic seats were added, replacing the old wooden benches. Chalmette baseball was state runner-up in 1969 and 1977, and made it to the state semifinals in 1978 and 2005. For the 2013 season, artificial turf was added to the girls' softball field next door, and a bank of tennis courts were constructed behind left field. The turfed field has put Suarez Stadium and the softball field next door in demand for showcase events, such as the Marucci Classic. An American Legion state tournament has been held here as well.

Since its release in 2003,Ultimate Tamiya TT-01 Chassis the TT-01 has become a very popular entry-level chassis, especially for drifting and rallying applications. The bathtub chassis frame combined with the central driveshaft makes it a durable car for everyday surfaces, and its relatively light weight plastic chassis and cut-out mounting positions for the battery and motor gives it a low center of gravity. Both in Europe and the US the TT-01 is the de facto choice for 24-hour endurance races. These events see teams of competitors, hobbyists, and friends build their TT-01 kit at the track the morning of the race then compete for 24 hours with teams of 5-8 people just like the races at Lemans and Daytona. Tamiya's recent addition of LED lights in most of their TT-01 kits sees these races take on an even more realistic look as the cars sport head and tail lights at night.  Versions  * TT-01 - The first Tamiya TT-01 was released as a Ferrari Enzo in 2003. The original version features a 27T 540 \\"silver-can\\" motor, open planetary differentials front and rear, and non-adjustable double wishbone suspension with dry friction shock absorbers. * TT-01 conversion kit - It is a full conversion (hop ups) of Tamiya TT-01. This version is an upgraded version from the original plastic parts to an aluminum hop ups & parts. Manufactured by Yeah Racing. * TT-01D (Drift) - Includes low friction, hard plastic \\"drift\\" tires, ball bearings, adjustable suspension arms, oil-filled shock absorbers and a Sport Tuned 25T Mabuchi Motor. It also comes with body shells of typical real- life drift cars like the Mazda FD3S RX-7, Nissan Silvia S15 Nismo Coppermix and Toyota Supra, and the kits include LED lights. * The TT-01R (Race) - Adds aluminum alloy drive shaft, adjustable rear toe-in and a Tamiya 25T \\"GT tuned\\" motor. The race kit does not come with a lexan body shell. * TT-01E (Enhanced) - The standard TT-01 model upgraded with polycarbonate suspension uprights and fibreglass-reinforced nylon upper deck/chassis bracing and motor mount, thus improving both the structural rigidity and the toughness of the vehicle. For more information on the updated parts check this information from tamiya: TT01 vs. TT01 E By Andrew Kuntze * TT-01D Type E - Combines \\"D\\" upgraded parts with \\"E\\" upgraded materials. * TT-01R Type E - Combines \\"R\\" upgraded parts with \\"E\\" upgraded materials. Also adds metal diff cup joints, dog bones and wheel axles. * TT-01ES (TT-01E Sport) - XB Series/RTR-only version of the TT01E kit. Uses cheaper materials to achieve lower retail price.  Expert built  Tamiya also sells the TT-01, TT-01D and TT-01E in Ready-to-Run (RTR) versions, designated \\"XB\\" or \\"Expert built\\". These come with pre-painted body shells, transmitters and receivers, and only needs batteries and a charger to get the model going. Depending on your country XB System RTR kits are also available. These ship with a simple wall plug charger and a standard size 7.2V 1800mah NiMH battery. Tamiya TT-01D 24 Hours of Andernach (Germany) The 24 Hours of Andernach (24h Rennen Andernach in German) is an endurance RC race that takes place once a year at the Andernach Autodrom in Germany. Uwe Rheinard, co-creator of the Euro Touring Series and father of Marc, four times IFMAR World Champion driver, started his annual 24-hour endurance-race event originally using Tamiya FWD kits. Since its introduction, the TT01 kit has been utilized. RC Racers around the world see this race as the biggest RC endurance race and many races in other countries are modeled after it. All teams utilize a Porsche 911 body. Since the event is held outdoors, the teams must be prepared for rain just like the real thing, because they do not stop the race for weather. In 2012, Conrad Electronic supported the event with 4000 mAh LiPo batteries. Rules allow a maximum of five battery packs. With 3482 laps, or 630 km, team ‚ÄòWilde 13‚Ä≤ won for the fourth time in row with their Falken-Porsche using only two sets of tires and without a single parts failure. 24 Hours of Jackson (USA) Inspired by Andernach, RC racers in the US caught onto the fun of endurance racing with the TT-01, most notably with the creation of the 24 Hours of Jackson held in Jackson, New Jersey. The race is promoted courtesy of the Jackson RC club, who are also known for hosting the 2011 ROAR National RC Championships. They held their 1st annual event in 2010 with great success seeing almost all teams finish the race. The facility is also an outdoor, curbed, euro-style track which is ideal for endurance racing as it cuts down on marshal needs which adds up over 24 hours. Many teams will find a motor change needed at some point in the race which again makes the TT-01 an ideal platform with its shaft drive making the change quick and painless. The race allows teams of 5-8 people and, unlike Andernach, the ability to choose their body of choice from 6-8 available selections that are in stock from Tamiya. Jackson also came to the decision in keeping the track layout the same for this particular race so subsequent years could attempt to break the distance record. This was to be the case with the winning team in 2010 covering 3963 laps only to be broken by the 2011 winner who managed 4118 laps total.

It is the largest museum in Sri Lanka. It is maintained by the Department of National Museum of the central government. The museum holds contains a collections of much importance to Sri Lanka such as the regalia of the country, including the throne and crown of the Kandyan monarchs as well as many other exhibits telling the story of ancient Sri Lanka.  History  Museum in 1896 The Colombo Museum, as it was called at the beginning, was established on 1 January 1877. Its founder was Sir William Henry Gregory the British Governor of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) at the time. The Royal Asiatic Society (CB) was instrumental in bringing to the notice of Gregory on his appointment as governor in 1872 the need for a public Museum with much difficulty the approval of the legislative council was obtained within a year. The Architect of the Public Works Department, James G. Smither (1833-1910) was able to prepare the plans for new structure on Italian Architectural style. The construction was completed in 1876 and the museum commenced it functions in the following year. The construction of the museum was carried out by Arasi Marikar Wapchie Marikar (1829-1925, aka Wapchi Marikar, who was descended from the Sheiq Fareed family who arrived in Ceylon in 1060), paternal grandfather of Sir Razik Fareed. Wapchi Marikar was the builder of the General Post Office in Colombo, Colombo Customs, Old Town Hall in Pettah, Galle Face Hotel, Victoria Arcade, Finlay Moir building, the Clock Tower, Batternburg Battery and many other buildings that are still standing today (2011). The Old Town Hall in Pettah, which is now a busy market, was built on a contract for the sum of 689 Sterling Pounds. In January 1877, the completed building of the Colombo Museum was declared open by Governor Gregory, in the presence of a large crowd, amongst which there were many Muslims present. At the end of the ceremony, the governor asked Wapchi Marikar what honour he wished to have for his dedication. He asked the same question of the carpenter S.M. Perera who was responsible for the woodwork of the museum, who requested and was awarded a local rank. Marikar requested that the museum be closed on Fridays, the Muslim sabbath; this request was granted and maintained, although the museum later much opened on all days except public holidaysMuseum opening hours When the throne of the last Kandyan King was to be exhibited at the museum, the then prime minister, Mr. D.S. Senanayake, obtained the consent of Sir Razik Fareed, Wapchi Marikar‚Äôs grandson, to keep the museum open on the intervening Fridays only. Sculpture of the Buddha located at the entrance of the museum. Heiyantuduwa Raja (elephant) Skeleton at National Museum of Colombo, Sri LankaDuring the period between 1877 and 1999, the authorities of the museum took various steps to display the cultural and natural heritage of the country for this purpose. Several other wings were added from time to time under the direction of Dr. Arthur Willey and Dr. Joseph Pearson new structures were built during the period of Dr. P.E.P. Deraniyagala, Dr. P.H.D.H. de Silva and Sirinimal Lakdusinghe. One of the natural history museum, and yet another consists of the auditorium. These buildings would facilitate the extension of the library ethnological and Anthropological studies, etc. Developments after 1940 The museum was given the status of a national museum during the period of P. E. P. Deraniyagala. He opened branch museums in Jaffna, Kandy, and Ratnapura and a fully-fledged department of national museum was established in 1942 under the act No. 31. Nine branch museums were ultimately opened, and a school science programme and a mobile museum service are also in operation. The museum has a copy of the Statue of Tara, a three-quarter life size statue of Tara currently held in the British Museum.The female as Cult Object in Buddhism, Digital Library, retrieved 10 December 2013 The crown jewels and the throne of the last King of Kandy, which were returned to Sri Lanka by the British Government, were added to the museum collection. Ground floor galleries are arranged in historical sequence, and upper galleries thematically. A library was also established on 1 January 1877. The government Oriental library (1870) was incorporated into Colombo National Museum library, and served as the nucleus of the library collection by collecting the local publications of the past 129 years; the library has been functioning as an unofficial national library in Sri Lanka, and became the first legal deposit library in the island. From its inception, special attention was given to building up of a collection related to Sri Lanka, Orientation and Natural Science. In 1982 Dr. Thelma Gunawardena became the first woman director of the National Museum of Colombo. She served from 1982 through 1994.

Under their management, Ritzy starts fighting in better venues and attracts the attention of Patricia Merrill (Claire Dodd). Patricia and Ritzy began an affair, which his wife Joan tolerates. When Ritzy learns that he has been winning because his opponents were paid to lose the fights, and that Joan agreed to these conditions, he leaves her. Ritzy is suspended for fighting in a fixed fight. Patricia loses interest in him because he is no longer successful. He gets a job attracting customers to a health lecture. Patricia is there and invites him to visit her, but he finds a pregnant Joan waiting at Patricia's apartment.

Growing up on Manhattan's Upper West Side around the corner from Rock Steady Park, home of the breakdancing pioneers Rock Steady Crew, Fontaine did some DJing himself while attending Bronx High School of Science.Larry Getlen, \\"A Better Vibe\\", Wesleyan (Wesleyan University alumni magazine), Issue IV 2006, p. 28‚Äì32. At Wesleyan University (Middletown, Connecticut), Fontaine double-majored in English and African-American studies;Wesleyan.edu while in college he met Stephanie Addison, his future wife. After two years teaching in Baltimore, Maryland, as part of the Teach for America program, he returned to New York City, interned for VIBE, and began writing on the side for British hip hop magazine True, soon renamed as Trace, where he eventually became an editor and hired away his own previous editor at VIBE, Scott Poulson-Bryant. While at True/Trace he befriended Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs. His editor-in-chief thought the relationship was too close, and that Combs was using him. \\"We were certainly being hustled,\\" said Fontaine later, \\"but in all hustles, there has to be a counter-hustle.\\" Fontaine thought that their \\"little magazine with no money and no marketing\\" stood to \\"ride [Combs'] coattails\\"; the editor-in-chief disagreed; Fontaine soon left to become features editor for The Source. An assignment to write a cover story on rapper DMX resulted in his spending two years as part of DMX's posse, getting 350 hours of \\"interviews\\" with him, which he shaped into E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX. In 2001, Fontaine hooked up with Damon Dash (rapper Jay-Z's manager); Dash financed the magazine America, with Fontaine running the show. The magazine first appeared in spring 2004. Fontaine left in 2006 after a falling out with Dash; he left to become editor-in-chief of GIANT, starting with the August 2006 issue. Works Formerly, Fontaine was the CEO and Editor-in-Chief of GIANT, the magazine of celebrity, style, and culture. Since taking the helm of the newly re-launched publication in August 2006, Fontaine cemented his status as one of the hottest editors in the magazine world with back-to-back covers of Beyonc√©, Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Alicia Keys and Prince. Prior to that, Fontaine was most notably the Senior Producer of Entertainment for Volume.com, the $35 million Internet portal sponsored by HBO; the US Editor of Trace magazine, where he secured the fashion and music magazine's US distribution and advertising deals and wrote nine cover stories; and the Music Editor of The Source, where he oversaw the growth of the world's largest music magazine on the newsstand and was nominated for a National Magazine Award for General Excellence in 2000. america, an ‚Äúurban luxury‚Äù publication he dreamed up while visiting his childhood home in London, England, enabled Fontaine to run his own company and continue his high-end cross-platform work with clients that included Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, Target and Lexus. His 42-page portfolio with Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs and Pen√©lope Cruz by photographer Peter Lindbergh for Estee Lauder is considered an advertorial benchmark. In 2002, Fontaine released his first two books. The first, What‚Äôs Your HI-FI Q?

His published works include Halcyon Days: Contributions to The Spirit Lamp, Dear Sir: Letters of Mr. and Mrs. Couperus to Oscar Wilde, I Desire The Moon: The Diary of Lady Alfred Douglas (Olive Custance), and Oscar Wilde: A Plea and a Reminiscence. He is currently working on an edition of the collected correspondence of Alfred Douglas. His latest book about Douglas is Alfred Douglas: A Poet's Life and his Finest Work, a biography of 'Bosie' which sets out to defend Oscar Wilde's lover 'Bosie' from over a century of allegedly false accusations and misinformation. Wintermans presents the case that Douglas was, contrary to popular belief, a supportive and kind lover who worshipped the playwright - and whose subsequent life was destroyed. The biographical portion of the book is also accompanied by an anthology of Douglas' poetry. The biography is an expanded English translation of Wintermans' earlier publication, Alfred Douglas. De boezemvriend van Oscar Wilde, which has also been translated into German and published as Lord Alfred Douglas, ein Leben im Schatten von Oscar Wilde.

Plot The show closely follows the plot of the books, with only a few alterations and cuts for length. The first act is based on Anne of Avonlea, while the second act is based on Anne of the Island. During the course of the first act, Gilbert Blythe gives up the position of Avonlea Schoolmaster for Anne Shirley, allowing her to stay close to home to care for her adoptive mother, Marilla Cuthbert. It is revealed that almost all of Avonlea knows that Gilbert is deeply in love with Anne, and she with him, although Anne will not admit it. In return for the kindness he has done her, Anne agrees to a wager with Gil; he will propose to her at some day of his choosing, and if she says no he will never ask again. After some time, Anne's best friend Diana Barry becomes engaged to her beau, Fred Wright and at the end of the first act, marries him. Gilbert takes advantage of his wager with Anne and proposes to her following the wedding, but she rejects him. He vows never to propose again. Through a series of fortuitous events, Anne is finally able to follow her dreams and go to Redmond University. The second act opens with Anne of the Island, introducing several new friends for Anne. Meanwhile, Anne falls in love with a millionaire named Royal Gardner much to the dismay of Marilla and Diana back home in Avonlea. Although she toys with the idea of marrying Roy, she finally decides that she does not truly love him and rejects his proposal. Roy storms off and is not seen again. Gilbert, who is paying his way through University with odd jobs, happens to be working as a waiter at the restaurant where Anne and Roy are. He gives Anne an early birthday gift in the form of three letters her parents left behind before they died. As she reads the letters she begins to realize that she truly can love somebody, and finally finds the love she's had for Gilbert all along. The show ends with Anne proposing to Gilbert back home in Avonlea for the summer, as the entire town and several friends from Redmond look on. Performances Anne & Gilbert opened in 2005 at the Victoria Playhouse in Victoria‚ÄìBy-the-Sea, Prince Edward Island, directed and choreographed by Duncan MacIntosh. In 2006, the production moved to the Harbourfront Theatre in Summerside, maintaining much of the original cast. The show continued to run at the Harbourfront each summer season until 2012, entering its seventh season with returning actors Amy Reitsma and Aaron Kyte in the title roles. The original production continues to run in Charlottetown, having moved to the Guild Theatre starting in 2013. A second professional production at The Thousand Islands Playhouse in July‚ÄìAugust 2007 was directed by Greg Wanless, music-directed by Sandy Thorburn, and choreographed by Kiri-Lyn Muir. A tour of Ontario took place in 2008. The production played for the first time outside of Prince Edward Island and for the first time by an amateur troupe at Catholic Central High School in Lethbridge, Alberta in spring 2007.

These terms have been applied in a wide variety of ways, and the meaning must be determined from each context. Typically, if a denomination is changing, and some refuse to change, and the denomination splits, those who did not change are referred to as the \\"Old Lights\\" and the ones who changed are referred to as the \\"New Lights\\". History The terms were first used during the First Great Awakening,1730's-1740's, which expanded through the British North American colonies in the middle of the 18th century. In A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God (1737), Jonathan Edwards, a leader in the Awakening, describes his congregants' vivid experiences with grace as causing a \\"new light\\" in their perspective on sin and atonement.Ava Chamberlain, \\"Self- Deception as a Theological Problem in Jonathan Edwards's 'Treatise Concerning Religious Affections,\\"' Church History, (1994) 63#4 pp. 541-556 in JSTOR Old Lights and New Lights generally referred to Congregationalists and Baptists in New England who took different positions on the Awakening from the traditional branches of their denominations. New Lights embraced the revivals that spread through the colonies, while Old Lights were suspicious of the revivals (and their seeming threat to authority). The historian Richard Bushman credits the division between Old Lights and New Lights for the creation of political factionalism in Connecticut in the mid-eighteenth century. Often many \\"new light\\" Congregationalists who had been converted under the preaching of George Whitefield left that connection to become \\"new light\\" Baptists when they found no evidence of infant baptism in the apostolic church. When told of this development, Whitefield famously quipped that he was glad to hear about the fervent faith of his followers but regretted that \\"so many of his chickens had become ducks.\\"Thomas R. Schreiner, Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ, (B&H; Publishing Group, 2007) pg. xvi https://books.google.com/books?id=EraDre6dUwYC&source;=gbs_navlinks_s The Presbyterian Church in Pennsylvania would experience a division during the Great Awakening, with those elements of the denomination embracing the revivals called \\"New Side\\" and those opposed to the revivals called \\"Old Side\\". In the Church of Scotland in the 1790s the \\"Old Lights\\" followed the principles of the Covenanters, while the \\"New Lights\\" were more focused on personal salvation and considered the strictures of the Covenants as less binding moral enormities.\\" The terms were also used in 1833, when a debate over swearing allegiance to the US Constitution split the Reformed Presbyterians. The \\"Old Light\\" Reformed Presbyterians, in keeping with their Covenanter heritage, refused to swear allegiance to the constitution, and thus to become citizens, because the constitution made no mention of the Lordship of Christ, whereas the \\"New Light\\" Reformed Presbyterians allowed for it. Following the split, the Old Lights eventually formed the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America and the New Lights formed the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod.

The seventh edition of the textbook was translated into several languages, including English. He published numerous articles on glaucoma, retinal disorders, trachoma and other eye maladies. Axenfeld was particularly interested in bacterial infections of the eye. In 1909 he was awarded the Graefe Medal by the German Ophthalmological Society for his research of sympathetic ophthalmia. With Otto von Schjerning (1853-1921), he collaborated on the Handbuch der √§rztlichen Erfahrungen im Weltkriege.Google Books Handbuch der √§rztlichen Erfahrungen im Weltkriege 1914/1918 He also made significant contributions to Kolle and Wassermann's Handbuch der pathogenen Mikroorganismen. Eponyms Axenfeld has several eponymous ophthalmic terms named after him, including: * \\"Axenfeld's conjunctivitis\\": Conjunctivitis caused by Moraxella lacunata. Sometimes called \\"Morax' disease\\": named after Victor Morax (1866-1935), who described the disorder independent of Axenfeld. * \\"Axenfeld's nerve loop\\": A posterior ciliary nerve loop that is noticeable in the sclera. * \\"Axenfeld syndrome\\": A syndrome characterized by corneal embryotoxon (posterior arcuate ring), a distinct Schwalbe's line and iris adhesion to Schwalbe's line.

Detail of floating floor over joists.'' A floating floor is a floor that does not need to be nailed or glued to the subfloor. The term floating floor refers to the installation method, but is often used synonymously with laminate flooring. It is applied now to other coverings such as floating tile systems and vinyl flooring in a domestic context. A sprung floor is a special type of floating floor designed to enhance sports or dance performance. In general though the term refers to a floor used to reduce noise or vibration. A domestic floating floor might be constructed over a subfloor or even over an existing floor. It can consist of a glass fibre, felt or cork layer for sound insulation with neoprene pads holding up a laminate floor. There is a gap between the floating floor and the walls to decouple them and allow for expansion; this gap is covered with skirting boards or mouldings. Floating floors as used in sound studios can be either just larger versions of the domestic variety, or much larger constructions with slabs of concrete to keep the resonance frequency down. The manufacture of integrated circuits uses massive floating floors with hundreds of tons in weight of concrete to avoid vibration affecting mask alignment. Floating floors are one of the requirements for the THX high-fidelity sound reproduction standard for movie theaters, screening rooms, home theaters, computer speakers, gaming consoles, and car audio systems. While floating floors add to the appeal of a home, they are not recommended for areas that may get wet, i.e. bathrooms and near exterior doors.

She was murdered by her father, Rahmi, in January 2002 in an honor killing. Life Fadime ≈ûahindal was opposed to her family's insistence on an arranged marriage, and instead selected her own boyfriend. At first she kept the relationship secret, but her father found out about it. ≈ûahindal then left her family and moved to Sundsvall, where her brother found her and threatened her. She went to the police, who advised her at first to talk to her family. She then turned to the media with her story, after which she turned again to the police and was offered a secret identity. By turning to the media, ≈ûahindal managed to receive support from the Swedish authorities. She filed a lawsuit against her father and brother, accusing them of unlawful threats, and won. ≈ûahindal was scheduled to move in with her boyfriend, Patrick, the following month, in June 1998, when he died in a car accident. He was buried in Uppsala. Her father forbade her to visit Uppsala, since he did not want her to visit her boyfriend's grave. Nalin Pekgul, a Kurdish-Swedish parliamentarian, negotiated a compromise in which ≈ûahindal agreed to stay away from Uppsala and her father promised not to stalk her. On 20 November 2001, the Violence Against Women network arranged a seminar on the topic \\"Integration on whose terms?\\". During the seminar, ≈ûahindal spoke in front of the Riksdag about her personal story.  Murder  On 21 January 2002, ≈ûahindal secretly visited her mother and sisters in Uppsala. During the visit, her father arrived and shot her in the head in front of her mother and two sisters. ≈ûahindal was buried in Uppsala.  Investigation and trial  Confronted by police, Rahmi ≈ûahindal confessed and said in his defense that he was ill. Despite the confession, one of her cousins later tried to convince the police that he had killed her. During the trial, her father said that another man killed ≈ûahindal, but claimed that he could not reveal the killer's identity under threat of death. Her father was ultimately convicted of murder by a Swedish court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released in 2018 after 16 years in prison. Her murder sparked a debate in Sweden about immigrant integration and raised questions regarding Patrick's death.

The highway is a major trunk road that carries heavy commuter traffic south from the Eastern Outlet to Howrah and Rokeby. As one of the Tasman Highway's principle Feeders and one of the eastern shore's major transport corridors, The South Arm Highway facilitates the movement of traffic between the suburbs and satellite communities to the south with the city centre and ultimately, other major cross city highways. With annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 17,000, the highway is considered a major traffic corridor within Hobart. The designation \\"South Arm Highway\\" arises from its journey south (via Rokeby Road) to South Arm. Route description South Arm Highway's northern end is at a grade-separated interchange with the Tasman Highway, at the boundary of Warrane and Mornington. The road continues north from the interchange as Flagstaff Gully Link to Flagstaff Gully, while immediately to the south is a roundabout with Cambridge Road, which carries the C329 road route towards Mornington. Only south of the roundabout is a T junction with Mornington Road, for access to the Mornington Business Estate. The highway continues south past the industrial area, and then curves to the south-east around the Waverley Flora Park. After entering the residential suburb of Howrah, South Arm Highway continues south-east to intersect Shoreline Drive at a large roundabout. Beyond this intersection, the highway passes through a reverse curve to reach its southern terminus at Oceana Drive. Rockeby Road continues on from the highway, as single-carriageway road, towards South Arm. The highway is assigned the road route B33, and in 2007, the annual average daily traffic volume was 17,000. History In 1965, a major Transportation Study was commissioned for the Hobart metropolitan area proposing the construction of several freeways to service the city, including a major south bound freeway servicing the eastern shore of the Derwent River. The Southeastern Freeway was intended to run south from the Tasman Highway, to the head of Kangaroo Bay, across the second beach and along through wirksworth, and to Rokeby. Some land was acquired but construction of the road never began. The Freeway was deemed to be unrealistic in that it was too expensive and would have come in close proximity to Schools and other vital services. =Bellerive Bypass= The concept of providing a major arterial road to Howrah was revisited with the release of the \\"Hobart Transport Revision\\" several years later. This new proposal entailed construction of a major road in an undeveloped corridor, bypassing Bellerive. Featuring a dual carriageway alignment, The first stage was opened in 1989. The Highway intersects the Tasman Highway at Mornington and then proceeds south through the Meehan Range before passing a large roundabout at Howrah. While the earthworks were completed in the first stage, the final proceeded as single carriageway to the old South Arm Highway alignment. Completion of the bypass replaced Clarence Street as the major trunk road connecting South Arm and Hobart which passed through Bellerive and Rosny. The final section of the bypass was completed in 2009, with the duplication of the South Arm Highway to Oceana Drive. Originally planned to be fully grade-separated, the highway is currently limited-access with at-grade intersections. Exits The entire highway is in the City of Clarence local government area.

The phrase is used mostly in the context of the European Union and the Schengen Area, but has been used by the Federal Court of Canada. One of the objectives of Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters is to prevent asylum shopping.Select Committee on European Union Tenth Report, House of Lords The Dublin Convention stipulates that asylum seekers are returned to the country where their entry into the union was first recorded and where they were first fingerprinted. Another objective of this policy is to prevent asylum seekers in orbit, i.e., to prevent the continual transfer of asylum seekers between countries trying to get others to accept them. To avoid abuses, European law, the Dublin Regulation, requires that asylum seekers have their asylum claim registered in the first country they arrive in, and that the decision of the first EU country they apply in, is the final decision in all EU countries. However, among some asylum seekers, the fingerprinting and registration is vehemently resisted in countries that are not considered asylum-seeker friendly, as they often wish to apply for asylum in Germany and Sweden where benefits are more generous. Some asylum seekers report burning their fingers so they can evade the fingerprint record control in Italy and apply for asylum in a country of their choice. The fingerprint record, known as the Eurodac system, is used to intercept false or multiple asylum claims. In Ireland, two-thirds of failed asylum seekers were found to be already known to the British border authorities, a third of the time under a different nationality, such as Tanzanians claiming to be fleeing persecution in Somalia.

Syndie is capable of reaching archives situated in those anonymous networks: I2P, Tor, Freenet.  History  Syndie has been in development since 2003 and ties in closely with the I2P network project, which is considered a parent project. Following the departure of lead developer Jrandom in 2007, work on syndie was paused, however as of 2013 active development has once again resumed.  Concept  Syndie operates in a manner similar to blogs, newsgroups, forums, and other content tools; it allows one or more authors to privately or publicly post messages. Messages are pushed and pulled to and from archive servers (other peers that choose to be), which are hosted in a variety of anonymous and non-anonymous locations. Most archive servers are HTTP archives hosted inside the I2P network, but there are syndie archives in Freenet as well as the normal internet. Each archive does not control the content stored on it; by default all messages are pushed and pulled by all participants. In this way, every message is backed up by every user, so should one archive go down, the content can be pushed to a different archive then pulled by other users of that archive. This means that even if all of the users and archives delete a message, as long as one person has it and there is one pushable archive, the message will be redistributed to every user. Users have the option to delete locally stored messages after a set time, after the local storage consumes a certain amount of disk space, or by blacklists of users. Each user can create multiple identities. Each identity is known as a forum, and users can post into their own or different forums. Each user can control their forum; for example, they may wish to run a blog by not permitting other people to start threads, but allowing them to post comments.  Technical requirements  Syndie is a Java application and as such can run on any platform on which Java is supported; although a standard widget toolkit is required for the graphical user interface versions. Syndie is primarily a graphical application, based on the Standard Widget Toolkit for Java, but it can be run in a CLI (headless) mode.

These ecosystems are located in Boreal forests which are commonly known as the taiga, particularly in Europe and Asia. The ecosystems that lie immediately to the south of boreal zones are often called hemiboreal. The K√∂ppen symbols of boreal ecosystems are Dfc, Dwc, Dfd, and Dwd.  Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS)  The Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) was a major international research field study in the Canadian boreal forest. The main research was completed between the years of 1994-1996 and the program was generously sponsored by NASA. The primary objectives were to determine how the boreal forest interacts with the atmosphere, how climate change will affect the forest, and how changes in the forest affect weather and climate.  Climate change effects  Boreal ecosystems display high sensitivity towards both natural and anthropogenic climate change, atmospheric warming due to greenhouse gas emissions ultimately leads to a chain reaction of climatic and ecological effects.

P. Smol. 1993. Rapid response of treeline vegetation and lakes to past climate warming. Nature 361: 243-246. The initial effects of climate change on the boreal ecosystem can include, but are not limited to, changes in temperature, rainfall, and growing season. Boonstra, R., Boutin, S., Jung, T. S., Krebs, C. J., & Taylor, S. (2018). Impact of rewilding, species introductions and climate change on the structure and function of the Yukon boreal forest ecosystem. Integrative Zoology, 13(2), 123-138. doi:10.1111/1749-4877.12288 Based on studies from the boreal ecosystems in the Yukon, a territory in northwestern Canada, climate change is having an impact on these abiotic factors. As a consequence, these effects drive changes in forest ecotone as well as marshlands or lakes in boreal ecosystems.Tinner, W., Bigler, C., Gedye, S., Gregory-Eaves, I., Jones, R. T., Kaltenrieder, P., . . . Hu, F. S. (2008). A 700-Year Paleoecological Record Of Boreal Ecosystem Responses To Climatic Variation From Alaska. Ecology, 89(3), 729-743. doi:10.1890/06-1420.1 This also concerns plant productivity and predator-prey interactions, which ultimately leads to habitat loss, fragmentation, and threatens biodiversity. In terms of boreal trees, the poleward limit for any given species is most likely defined by the temperature, whereas the equatorial limit is generally defined by competitive exclusion. Basically, as changes in climate occur, change in the corresponding weather variables follows. Woodward, F.I. 1987. Climate and plant distribution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 188 pp. As climate conditions change, ecosystem alterations involving timing for migration, mating, plant blooming can occur. This can lead to the transition into a different type of ecosystem as the northward shift of plant and animal species has already been observed. Trees may expand towards the tundra; however, they may not survive due to various temperature or precipitation stressors. The rate depends on growth and reproductive rate, and adaptation ability of the vegetation. In addition, the migration of flora may lag behind warming for a few decades to a century, and in most cases warming happens faster than plants can keep up. Due to permafrost thaw and disturbance alterations such as fire and insect outbreaks, certain models have suggested that boreal forests have developed into a net carbon source instead of a net carbon sink. Olsson, R. (2009). Boreal Forest and Climate Change. Although the trees in the boreal are aging, they continue to accumulate carbon into their biomass. However, if disturbed higher than normal amounts of carbon will be lost to the atmosphere. In some areas, boreal ecosystems are located on a layer of permafrost, which is a layer of permanently frozen soil. The underground root systems of boreal trees are stabilized by permafrost, a process which permits the deeper trapping of carbon in the soil and aids in the regulation of hydrology. Ashton, M. S., M.

Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests. Science 320: 1444‚Äì1449. Permafrost is able to store double the amount of current atmospheric carbon that can be mobilized and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases when thawed under a warming climate feedback.Loranty, M.

It consists of two separate weapons combined into a single unit: a lower assault rifle chambered to fire 5.56√ó45mm NATO rounds and an upper 20√ó30mm (caliber of shell x length of propellent case) grenade launcher firing both conventional and air-bursting \\"smart\\" grenades, along with its integrated digital sighting unit. History The K11 was officially unveiled to the public at the DSEI military expo, though information pertaining to its development has been available since 2006. The weapon was adopted by the Republic of Korea Armed Forces in 2008 and was distributed within the Republic of Korea Army during 2010, making it the world's first army to use an airburst rifle as standard issue in the military. Each squad is reported to be issued two K11s, though it will not replace grenadiers who currently use K2 rifles with the underslung K201 grenade launcher. In May 2010, the United Arab Emirates purchased a quantity of 40 K11s for evaluation purposes for a total cost of US$560,000, giving an indicative unit cost of US$14,000. In March 2011 it was announced that 15 out of 39 K11s issued since June 2010 (including 7 out of 20 rifles used by Korean forces in Afghanistan) had shown serious defects and the decision had been made to halt production and modify the design. The defects included: barrel movements during firing, defects in the striking mechanism, condensation forming inside the laser reception lens, and defects in switching from single to automatic fire. South Korea's state procurement agency, The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said it has fixed the defects by modifying the designs and improving the shooting control system and will resume its production. A total of 4,000 K11s were to be produced with all to be fielded by 2014.S&T; Daewoo K11 DAW (Dual-barrel Airburst Weapon) - Thefirearmblog.com, 3 October 2013 In September 2014, a major defect was found in the fire control system of the K11, which suspended production as well as use of the 900 rifles distributed to the Army. The Agency for Defense Development says a solution will be implemented on a large scale before the end of 2016.South Korea to complete upgrade of faulty K-11 dual-barrel assault rifle by 2016-end - Armyrecognition.com, 30 July 2015 In 2017, the 2nd gen K11 was revealed with huge improvements for its weight and 20mm grenade firepower. In 2019, however, the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea notified the Defense Acquisition Program Administration to completely suspend the K11 project, citing a lack of accuracy and various defects. Design Equipped with a laser range-finder as well as a ballistics computer, the K11 allows the operator to quickly find the distance to a target and launch an airburst shell. The shell will then detonate a few meters away from the target. An electronic scope is integrated on the K11; it can be linked to a goggle system with a digital display. The display can be used during nighttime with thermal imaging, and shows the range information from the laser range-finder. The weapon is compatible with standard 20- or 30-round 5.56√ó45mm NATO magazines, and can hold 6-round magazines of 20 mm shells at one time. The fire selector position and layout is similar to the M16/M4 rifles' selector, though some controls are different. It has four positions, three of which are: 9 o'clock for safe; 6 o'clock for three-round burst for the rifle; and 3 o'clock for semiautomatic fire for the rifle. The fourth selector position is at 12 o'clock and controls the grenade launcher, allowing bullets and grenades to be fired using the same trigger. Because of this they both cannot be available at the same time.Daewoo K11 Advanced Combat Rifle: The Future Has Arrived - SAdefensejournal.com, 6 January 2012 There are two types of 20 mm grenade rounds for the K11; the K168 training round is for practice and has no explosives, while K167 explosive ammunition weighs and has an internal fuse with three selectable settings for point detonation, point detonation-delay, and airburst. The integrated weapon sight programs the airburst warheads after the laser rangefinder sights a target when the launcher is selected (the sight automatically provides aiming points for either bullets or grenades when their firing modes are selected). Point detonation explodes the shell on impact with a target and point detonation-delay lets the warhead penetrate a target before exploding; penetration ability is unknown. The airburst setting detonates the grenade round in front of, over, or behind a target to hit troops in cover yielding an airburst effect capable of killing targets within a 6 m area and seriously wounding those within an 8 m area. Users enter a range at which the shell is to detonate into the sighting unit, which automatically calculates the time of flight and sets the chambered round's fuse to detonate when it reaches that point. If a round is not fired within two minutes of targeting information being programmed, it will disarm itself. If a grenade does not explode, a backup self-destruct safety mechanism automatically detonates it after being at rest two seconds after impact to leave no unexploded ordnance. One of the problems with the previous American Objective Individual Combat Weapon, which influenced the combination rifle/airburst launcher concept, was that its 20 mm grenade rounds were not very lethal. The fragments were often too small and light to be effective, there was not enough explosive material to create a large kill radius, and many fragments were dispersed vertically and away from the target. This was one of the reasons the OICW effort was cancelled, and it is not known if these deficiencies were addressed with the K11's airburst grenades of the same size. However, Daewoo solved this problem by increasing the height of the grenade, and a recent report indicated that the 20mm airburst grenade has more lethal fragments than a 40mm grenade. Furthermore, after the 2nd improvements, they developed a new technology which enabled the 20mm airburst grenade to explode in a single fixed direction to increase firepower, instead of exploding in all directions (which would reduce firepower). The K11 is being upgraded to reduce the shock generated in firing the 5.56 mm rounds by as much as 40 percent, and similar technology is under review to decrease the shock of launching 20 mm shells. This will likely strengthen the ammunition power of the rifle make it easier to use, while also reducing the weight of the weapon by 10 percent. In 2017, Daewoo revealed the 2nd gen K11 which improved the weight and the 20mm airburst grenade firepower. Users *: Adopted by the Republic of Korea Armed Forces in 2010.

In 1882, while workmen were digging the foundation of a house, they discovered a marble tombstone bearing a Hebrew inscription in memory of a certain Samuel b. Solomon, who died Marheshwan 11, 4680 (October 9, 919 CE). By the kings of Aragon, the Jews of Calatayud were granted certain privileges, among which was one with regard to the oath; and these privileges were from time to time renewed. The Jewish quarter of Calatayud was situated in the vicinity of the river Las Pozas, and extended from St Maria de la Pe√±a to the Torre Mocha. On the opposite side of the river lay the Jewish cemetery. The community, which, during its prosperous times, annually paid 6,000 maravedis in taxes, possessed two large synagogues, one of which, situated at the end of the Jewish street, was very beautiful. This synagogue was built by Aaron b. Yahya, and renovated by his relative, Joseph b. Yahya. There were also several large schools, two of which were founded respectively by Joseph Parhi and Jacob b. Calna. In addition to these there was a school for the association of weavers, and another attached to the Hebrah Kaddishah. As the members of the congregation occasionally absented themselves from the synagogues and held prayers in private houses, the \\"aljama\\" (community) ordained that services were to be held only in the regularly constituted synagogues and schools; and that an infringement of this mandate was to be punished by a fine, one-half of which was to be donated to the crown. There were, however, two persons exempt from this law: one, the physician Don Bahiel al-Constantini, who lived some distance from the synagogue; the other, Moses b. Shaprut, whose gout prevented his attendance at the service. In 1326, the Jews of Calatayud had indiscreetly admitted two Christians to Judaism; in consequence the former were condemned to severe punishment by the inquisitor, but later pardoned by King Jaime. In the war between Castile and Aragon in 1367, the Jews of Calatayud and Daroca, of whom the former had bravely defended their city, were subjected to great suffering at the hands of the Castilian soldiery, having their shops plundered and their children ruthlessly massacred. As a result of this war the walls of the city of Calatayud, which had been heavily damaged and partly destroyed, had to be restored; and since the Jews were willing to repair only the walls of their immediate quarter, a joint conference was held on January 11, 1390, between the city council and the representatives of the aljama (among whom were the physicians Samuel Sadoch, Jacob Azarias, and Don Samuel b. Shaprut), at which it was agreed that the Jews were to rebuild all the walls of the city, but that they were to receive reimbursement from the Christian inhabitants for all the additional money expended. In consequence of the persecutions and the sermons of the proselytizing Vicente Ferrer, a large number of the wealthiest Jews of Calatayud in 1391, and more particularly in 1413, accepted baptism. Among the converts were the following distinguished families: the Clementes, whose progenitor was Moses Hamorro; the Santangels, descended from Azarias Ginillo; the Villanuebas, from Moses Patagon; and the children of the wealthy Samuel Vibon. Several of these persons rose to high eminence in Church and state, but many fell victims to the Inquisition. The community, once wealthy and powerful, gradually declined, until (about fifty years before the expulsion of the Jews from Spain) it was able to pay only a modicum in taxes. Calatayud was always celebrated as a great seat of Jewish learning, and among its eminent scholars were: the grammarian Solomon ibn Par·∏•on, who was born at Calatayud and was a friend of Judah ha-Levi; the rabbi Solomon Reuben, who was related to Hasdai Crescas, and had many enemies (he was finally compelled to give place to the preacher En Bima); R. David ibn Shoeib, who enjoyed the esteem of both Jewish and Christian circles, and who, like Moses Alkabiz and Don Solomon b. David, carried on a correspondence with Isaac b. Sheshet. The Nasi D. Samuel ha-Levi and R. Moses b. Susa (the latter probably identical with the correspondent of Isaac b. Sheshet at Ucles) were the representatives of the Calatayud community at the disputation at Tortosa. The last preacher of the congregation of Calatayud was the celebrated Isaac Arama. According to Steinschneider, the Jewish family name \\"Kalai\\" is derived from this city.

According to its discoverers, Jesse Lawrence (from Scripps Institute of Oceanography) and Michael Wysession (from Washington University), the Beijing Anomaly is evidence for large amounts of water contained within the mantle. Characteristics The effects of water on the attenuation of seismic waves are largely unknown, although theoretical expectations seem to indicate that a seismic Q¬∑¬π factor change from 300 to 100 can be explained by an approximate tenfold increase in water content. This leads to the hypothesis that only small amounts of water, present at depth within the mantle (on the order of 0.1 wt%), will lead to significant seismic attenuation and could potentially explain the anomalously low Q¬∑¬π values which extend over a broad region in the mantle below Northeast Asia. The zone of low Q¬∑¬π existing in the mantle below Northeastern China was found via seismic attenuation tomography and begins approximately 700 km below the surface and displays stark decreases in Q¬∑¬π values, down to a minimum of Q¬∑¬π= 95 at around 1000 km in depth. The extent of the anomaly below a large portion of Northeast Asia would require the existence of contributing factors which would facilitate the distribution of water within the mantle itself. Factors which could facilitate the dispersion of water to such a degree include mantle-rock advection and water transport along grain boundaries. It has therefore been suggested that the downgoing oceanic lithosphere can carry with it large amounts of water into deeper regions of the mantle, directly below the continental margins (to depths reaching far beyond 1400 km). The water contained within these subducting slabs is thought to remain unaffected by the surrounding high-temperature and pressure conditions, since it is contained within the centre of the cold lithospheric slab. The seismic attenuation anomalies in Northeast China are potentially explained by water having been extracted from the cold, deep-seated oceanic lithosphere and ‚Äúflooding‚Äù the overlying lower mantle wedge at depth, giving rise to zones of high elasticity (and potentially fluid-rich) which would cause levels of seismic attenuation that were observed tomographically.Bohm, M. Haberland, C. Imaging fluid-related subduction processes beneath Central Java (Indonesia) using seismic attenuation tomography. Tectonophysics. April 1, 2013. Vol 590. pp 175-188. Recent research has been able to better constrain the degree to which subducting oceanic mantle is hydrated using measurements of P-wave attenuation from localized earthquakes near the Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zone. Estimates suggest an approximately 40 km thick layer of moderately serpentinized mantle would be sufficient to explain the observed seismic P-wave attenuations associated to events occurring at depths of around 5‚Äì35 km below the Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zone. This would imply that the topmost zones of the oceanic lithosphere provide a significant source of water to deeper areas of the mantle during subduction, with an estimated flux of 170-318 Tg/ma of water per meter of down-going slab.Garth, T., Rietbrock, A.

The Gordon Strong Automobile Objective was a proposed planetarium, restaurant, and scenic overlook designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright for the top of Sugarloaf Mountain in Maryland. Wright developed the design in 1925 on commission from Chicago businessman Gordon Strong. A spiraling ramp featured centrally in Wright's plan; this was his first use of a feature which would later gain fame as part of his Guggenheim Museum in New York. History and design Strong became familiar with Sugarloaf Mountain while living in Washington, D.C. prior to around the start of the 20th century. The mountain is a monadnock which due to the lack of competing peaks in the area possesses considerable views of its surroundings.Reinberger, 38. Strong began to buy land on Sugarloaf Mountain as early as 1902, and between then and his retirement in 1935 he developed various plans for developing the mountain as a resort or recreation center. The \\"automobile objective\\" idea was one such plan, which Strong proposed to Wright in 1924. The \\"automobile objective\\" was primarily a day-trip destination; people would drive out to the mountain, perhaps picnic while enjoying the scenic views, and then return home. Wright's design went through various iterations, but the main feature was a ziggurat- like circular structure at the pinnacle of the mountain. The structure was wrapped in a spiraling ramp which cars would use to ascend and descend. The ramp was the main exterior feature of the structure, aside from a tall spire sticking up from the center, which was likely intended as a mooring post for dirigibles.Reinberger, 40. Parking for hundreds of cars was placed inside the building. In developing the concept, Wright decided to include an auditorium inside the spiraling ramps, and move the tower to the side. Another notable element of this design was the specification of glass, or glass blocks in concrete armature, as the material for the ramp, which would let more natural light into the interior space. This was possibly impractical but certainly daring. Wright's final and most complete plan for the site replaced the interior theatre with a larger domed open space that would be used as a planetarium. This was the plan that he presented to Strong in 1925. The size of the interior dome necessitated moving all parking outside, onto the ramp itself, and limited the space available for eateries and overnight bedrooms. Strong regarded the plan as unsuitable and rejected it, believing that it allocated space poorly and violated the integrity of the mountaintop. Wright reacted sharply to the rejection: \\"I have given you a noble 'archaic' sculptured summit for your mountain. I should have diddled it away with platforms and seats and spittoons for‚Ä¶expectorating businessmen and the flappers that beset them.\\"Letter of Wright to Strong, October 20, 1925. Quoted in Reinberger, 46. Critical commentary and legacy Mark Reinberger asserts that the design is evidence of Wright's desire to find a new form of architectural expression, a utopian scheme reliant on modern technology‚Äîin the case of this project, the automobile.Reinberger, \\"Sugarloaf Mountain Project\\", passim. Wright's vision culminated in his plan for Broadacre City. In Broadacre City, automobile objectives would be built at locations of natural beauty to serve as a meeting places and social centers. Sugarloaf Mountain was an early expression of Wright's attachment to the automobile as an important social artifact. He criticized people driving to a destination and leaving their car parked underground: \\"leaving the automobiles in which they both now really live and have their beings, still 'parked' aside,--betrayed and abandoned as usual.\\"Letter of Wright to Strong, October 20, 1925. Quoted in Reinberger, 46. The Gordon Strong plan was Wright's first spiral-based building, but he returned to the element at least six times, building first the V. C. Morris Gift Shop (1948) in San Francisco and finally delivering the well-known Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1943‚Äì1959).Quinan, 473.

In interstitial defects, two or more atoms may share one lattice site, thereby increasing its total energy.Ehrhart, P. (1991) Properties and interactions of atomic defects in metals and alloys, H. Ullmaier (ed.), Landolt-B√∂rnstein, New Series III vol. 25 ch. 2, pp. 88 ff. Springer, Berlin. Alternatively small atoms in some crystals may occupy interstitial sites in energetically favorable configurations, such as hydrogen in palladium. Interstitials can be produced by bombarding a crystal with elementary particles having energy above the displacement threshold for that crystal, but they may also exist in small concentrations in thermodynamic equilibrium.  Self-interstitials  Self- interstitial defects are interstitial defects which contain only atoms which are the same as those already present in the lattice. Structure of self- interstitial in some common metals. The left-hand side of each crystal type shows the perfect crystal and the right-hand side the one with a defect. The structure of interstitial defects has been experimentally determined in some metals and semiconductors. Contrary to what one might intuitively expect, most self-interstitials in metals with a known structure have a 'split' structure, in which two atoms share the same lattice site. Typically the center of mass of the two atoms is at the lattice site, and they are displaced symmetrically from it along one of the principal lattice directions. For instance, in several common face-centered cubic (fcc) metals such as copper, nickel and platinum, the ground state structure of the self-interstitial is the split [100] interstitial structure, where two atoms are displaced in a positive and negative [100] direction from the lattice site. In body-centered cubic (bcc) iron the ground state interstitial structure is similarly a [110] split interstitial. These split interstitials are often called dumbbell interstitials, because plotting the two atoms forming the interstitial with two large spheres and a thick line joining them makes the structure resemble a dumbbell weight-lifting device. In other bcc metals than iron, the ground state structure is believed based on recent density-functional theory calculations to be the [111] crowdion interstitial, which can be understood as a long chain (typically some 10‚Äì20) of atoms along the [111] lattice direction, compressed compared to the perfect lattice such that the chain contains one extra atom. Structure of dumbbell self-interstitial in silicon. Note that the structure of the interstitial in silicon may depend on charge state and doping level of the material. In semiconductors the situation is more complex, since defects may be charged and different charge states may have different structures. For instance, in silicon, the interstitial may either have a split [110] structure or a tetrahedral truly interstitial one.Watkins, G. D. (1991) \\"Native defects and their interactions with impurities in silicon\\", p. 139 in Defects and Diffusion in Silicon Processing, T. Diaz de la Rubia, S. Coffa, P. A. Stolk and C. S. Rafferty (eds.), MRS Symposium Proceedings vol. 469. Materials Research Society, Pittsburg. Carbon, notably in graphite and diamond, has a number of interesting self- interstitials - recently discovered using Local-density approximation- calculations is the \\"spiro-interestitial\\" in graphite, named after spiropentane, as the interstitial carbon atom is situated between two basal planes and bonded in a geometry similar to spiropentane.  Impurity interstitials  Small impurity interstitial atoms are usually on true off- lattice sites between the lattice atoms. Such sites can be characterized by the symmetry of the interstitial atom position with respect to its nearest lattice atoms. For instance, an impurity atom I with 4 nearest lattice atom A neighbours (at equal distances) in an fcc lattice is in a tetrahedral symmetry position, and thus can be called a tetrahedral interstitial. Large impurity interstitials can also be in split interstitial configurations together with a lattice atom, similar to those of the self-interstitial atom. Octahedral (red) and tetrahedral (blue) interstitial symmetry polyhedra in a face-centered cubic lattice. The actual interstitial atom would ideally be in the middle of one of the polyhedra.  Effects of interstitials  Interstitials modify the physical and chemical properties of materials. * Interstitial carbon atoms have a crucial role for the properties and processing of steels, in particular carbon steels. * Impurity interstitials can be used e.g. for storage of hydrogen in metals. *The crystall lattice can expand with the concentration of impurity interstitials * The amorphization of semiconductors such as silicon during ion irradiation is often explained by the buildup of a high concentration of interstitials leading eventually to the collapse of the lattice as it becomes unstable. * Creation of large amounts of interstitials in a solid can lead to a significant energy buildup, which on release can even lead to severe accidents in certain old types of nuclear reactors (Wigner effect). The high-energy states can be released by annealing. * At least in fcc lattice, interstitials have a large diaelastic softening effect on the material. * It has been proposed that interstitials are related to the onset of melting and the glass transition.

He has managed English rock groups The Who and Judas Priest, as well as artists Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. Life Curbishley was one of six children born to a London docker and his wife. He is the older brother of ex-West Ham United and Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley, and grew up near West Ham Station in London. He married Jackie Curbishley, but the couple later divorced. He then remarried, and had two children. During the 1960s, Curbishley served a prison term for armed robbery of a bank van, though he denied involvement in the crime. Curbishley owns a London home and a villa in Spain. Career Curbishley started his career in the music business in the early 1970s at Track Records, managing tours for The Who and other artists such as Thunderclap Newman, Golden Earring and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Curbishley produced The Who's film Tommy, the prison movie McVicar and also the film Buddy's Song, all starring The Who's Roger Daltrey. With Daltrey, he also established the Goldhawke production company to issue the singer's solo albums. Curbishley left Track in the mid-seventies after financial issues led to the decline of the company. With his wife Jackie, he established Trinifold, Ltd., a music management company. After a royalty dispute, Curbishley's company acquired management of The Who in 1976 and soon expanded to manage other well-known artists such as Judas Priest and Robert Plant. It was at the suggestion of Curbishley that Plant disbanded his Shaken 'n' Stirred touring ensemble in the mid-1980s, starting afresh with a completely new band and writing with different musicians. As a direct result of this, Plant re-emerged as a hugely successful recording and touring artist. In 1994, Curbishley assumed management of guitarist Jimmy Page, and in the same year, was integral in the reuniting of Page and Plant, both former members of Led Zeppelin. Despite failed attempts by others to reunite the pair, Curbishely was able to persuade the previously reluctant Plant to work with Page again, resulting in the highly successful Unledded album, video and world tour. During this period, Curbishley and Trinifold also managed the solo career of Francis Dunnery (former frontman of It Bites, and Plant's guitarist prior to his reunion with Page). Trinifold Music has published songs recorded by many other artists including Chicago, Kenny Rogers, Atlantic Starr, Karyn White, Faith Hill and Kenny Chesney. In 2004, UB40 and Rachel Fuller were added to Trinifold's roster. In 2001, Curbishley served as the executive producer of a BBC1 documentary on the life of Reggie Kray. In 2002, Trinifold was acquired by The Sanctuary Group, but Curbishley continued to manage the company. He later embarked on more film production projects, including films such as The Railway Man. He is currently co-producing a film about the life of Keith Moon with Roger Daltrey.

Its melody is often used as wedding music in Jewish weddings. It is well known not only within Israeli and Jewish music circles, but known throughout the Middle East, and it is often used as a song belly dancers dance to. The song has also been translated into Armenian, in which language its title is \\"Yarus (O, Rose!)\\". The music is by Yosef Hadar, the lyrics are by Moshe Dor. The song was first recorded in 1957 by singer Yafa Yarkoni, and a year later by the duo HaDuda'im. Their version became a smash hit in Israel. The Dudaim toured the world extensively in the '60s, and \\"Erev shel Shoshanim\\" became one of their international signature songs. During the '60s and '70s the song was recorded by various international singers, including Harry Belafonte, Olivera Katarina, Nana Mouskouri, Daliah Lavi, Martin Simpson and Miriam Makeba. In 1974, Yugoslav progressive rock band Dah recorded their hit song \\"≈†o≈°ana\\", which featured melody based on \\"Erev Shel Shoshanim\\".\\"≈†o≈°ana\\" at Discogs In 1975, after moving to Belgium and changing the name to Land, the band recorded an English-language version of \\"≈†o≈°ana\\" (entitled \\"Shoshana\\"), which became an international hit and made the song's melody a popular football chant. In 1966, the Israeli folk dancing choreographer Zvi Hillman created the first folk dance based on the song. Juhani Forsberg used the melody, which he thought to be an Israeli folksong, in his song Tiell√§ ken vaeltaa, which has since ended up in the hymnbook of Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. A version of the song was also sampled in the 2016 hit song, \\"Save Me\\"http://www.samples.fr/the-parakit-save-me/ by French pop artist The Parakit.

Biography Born as the son of the king's lieutenant in Fontenay-le-Comte, Vend√©e, Brisson studied law in Orl√©ans, Bourges and finally Poitiers, where he stayed on as an advocate. Between 1553 and 1556, he moved on to Paris, where he swiftly gained repute for his learning and rhetorical skills. Charles IX named him Advocate General of the Parlement in 1573. His successor, Henry III, put particular trust in Brisson, who was made first Fiscal in 1573, promoted to Pr√©sident √† mortier in 1580, appointed Sixth President of the Parlement in 1588 and entrusted with several diplomatical missions. As the French Wars of Religion flamed up again, Brisson remained in Paris after the royalist judges on the Parlement fled the city on 16 January 1589, following the King, who had fled on May 13, 1588. Next day, the Seize (\\"sixteen\\"), a group of League notables that now ruled Paris, installed Brisson as First President of the Parlement in replacement of Achille de Harlay. As a politique, Brisson sought to mediate between the warring factions. The Seize, however, soon began to mistrust him, because they considered him to remain loyal to Henry. Consequently, they had him sentenced to death by a special court and executed by hanging in 1591. Scholarly work The frontispiece of De Verborum. The first page of the table of contents of the Code Henri III. Brisson never held academic office. Despite this, he is ‚Äì with Contius, Balduinus, Cujacius, Hotmannus and Donellus ‚Äì among the group of 16th century French jurists that brought Humanist jurisprudence to its peak. His principal work is De Verborum Quae ad Jus Civile Pertinent Significatione (1559), a two-folio dictionary of Justinian legal terminology that saw 17 reeditions (often much amended) up until 1805. De Verborum was the standard legal dictionary of the time, and for centuries remained an authoritative source for lexicographers. Among his other works, the following warrant particular mention. The Code Henri III was an influential 1587 compilation of the laws of France. It saw numerous reeditions, as did Brisson's works on pre-Justinian Roman law. These include De formulis et solennibus populi Romani verbis, a comprehensive compilation of Roman legal terminology.

He opened a new store at Lodhi Colony Market in New Delhi in December 2005. Arora exhibited some of his work at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London for an exhibition called \\"Global Local\\" in association with the British Council, India. A fashion jury in a leading Indian publication Outlook designated him \\"Best Indian Fashion Designer\\" and featured him on the cover of its March 2006 issue. Manish opened his first Manish Arora franchise store in Villa Moda, Kuwait and another Manish Arora Fish Fry store at Crescent at The Qutub, New Delhi in 2006. In 2007 the first Fish Fry for Reebok concept store opened at the Garden of Five Senses, New Delhi, and Arora teamed up with make-up and cosmetics company MAC for designing a signature collection. He has also collaborated with Swatch for a limited edition of watches. In 2008, once again, Reebok launched the 'RBK Fish Fry Collection 2008', a lifestyle range designed by Manish Arora. \\"Indian by Manish Arora\\", a brand designed for the growing Indian market for women's wear, is licensed to another fashion company. Manish was invited to show his collection at the ‚ÄúFashion in Motion‚Äù exhibition held at Victoria and Albert Museum, London in September 2007. By 2009 Manish owned four stores in India and sold his collections to more than 80 retailers worldwide. The designer has also entered into a joint venture with BIBA Apparels Pvt. Ltd. to further expand the label. In 2012, Arora previewed his jewellery line in association with label Amrapali comprising a range of hand jewellery, neckpieces and pendants.

The taxonomy of this species has caused some confusion in the past and it almost certainly belongs in a species complex with other African Buteo species. Some taxonomists have considered this species, the Archer's buzzard, and the augur buzzard to be the same superspecies.Brooke, R. K. (1975). The taxonomic relationship of Buteo rufofuscus and B. augur. Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club, 95, 152-154. Many taxonomists consider them all to be distinct, having different calls, different home ranges and variations in plumage. This is a species that lives among mountains, and on adjacent savanna and grassland. It is resident and non-migratory throughout its range. Description The jackal buzzard is one of the two larger Buteo species native to Africa, alongside its close cousin, the augur buzzard. Adults may measure in total length.Sinclair, I. (2004). A Photographic Guide to Birds of Southern Africa. Struik. In weight, one survey found 55 unsexed birds to weight from while another found seven males to weigh from and eleven females to weigh from .Ferguson-Lees, J., & Christie, D. A. (2001).

Another female also weighed approximately , making this one of the massive of the world's Buteo species.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . 18 jackal buzzards were found to have averaged .Mendelsohn, J. M., Kemp, A. C., Biggs, H. C., Biggs, R., & Brown, C. J. (1989). Wing areas, wing loadings and wing spans of 66 species of African raptors. Ostrich, 60(1), 35-42. Wingspan in this species is known to range from , with an average of in 9 birds being almost identical to the mean wingspan of the augur buzzard. The striking patterns of adult jackal buzzards, blackish and rufous, is distinctive. The adult jackal buzzard is strikingly plumaged and arguably one of the most \\"handsome\\" buzzards.Mendelsohn, J. M. (1997). Jackal Buzzard Buteo rufofuscus. The atlas of southern African birds, 1, 212-213. It is almost black above with a rufous tail. The primary flight feathers are blackish and the secondaries off-white, both barred with black. Below the chin and around the throat is mainly chestnut, and the rest of the underparts and the underwing coverts are rich rufous but for a contrasting black abdomen with faint white bars. The flight feathers from below present a large white panel, contrasting with black on the hand and black on the tips that form a dark trailing edge to the wing. Beyond its unmistakable colours, the jackal buzzard has a very short tail, broad wings, bulky body and large bill compared to most other buzzards but for the augur buzzard. The juvenile jackal buzzard is mainly brown above and a somewhat washed out rufous-buff brown below, often manifesting worn feathers that appear as lighter buffy or whitish streaking. The tail of the juvenile is usually buff-brown, with or without a somewhat creamy pale tip. The underwing of juvenile has black tips and whitish panel similar to adults but the inside of the wing is rufous-buff (similar to body feathers) streaked with brown. Sympatric with the jackal buzzard only in Namibia, the augur buzzard is usually distinctly paler at every stage of development than the jackal buzzard, especially lacking the rich underside tones of adults. However, both species have a melanistic form (rather rarer as far as is known in the jackal than the augur buzzard) which are very similar in appearance and may only be told apart by the melanistic augur having slight dark streaking on the white wing panels.Steyn, P. (1983). Birds of prey of southern Africa: Their identification and life histories. Croom Helm, Beckenham (UK). 1983. An unlikely confusion species is the slightly larger bateleur, given its short rufous tail but the larger-headed, heavier set eagle bears a very distinct and particular head, wing and body shape and obvious distinct colours as adults. The juvenile bateleur may be confused with the similarly brown jackal buzzard but is much more dusky below with rather differing wing colour on its bulging wings. The jackal buzzard has a call of a sharp, barking quality, weeah ka-ka-ka or kyaahh-ka-ka-ka. The female jackal buzzard voice is deeper than that of the male. The fact that its call is reminiscent of that of black-backed jackal, is believed to be the source of the species' common name. It has a lower tone than the call of the forest buzzard and is very different from the harsh crowing of the augur buzzard. It is also reminiscent of the call of the American red-tailed hawk. Range and habitat The jackal buzzard is endemic to southern Africa. Despite its limited range, it is a fairly common species of raptor. It inhabits most of South Africa, with an absence at some of the north-central part but common in the Transvaal. Thence the range extends in the west up to central Namibia and in east through Lesotho and Swaziland into south Mozambique and, to the west, in extreme southeast Botswana. This is largely a mountain-dwelling species, but can range low rocky outcrops and rubble at sea-level to high mountainous in Lesotho up to . It can adapt to both desert-like, arid conditions and areas with high rainfall and verdant plant life. Mostly it prefers to be close to grassland in which to execute most of its hunting.Barnard, P. (1987). Foraging site selection by three raptors in relation to grassland burning in a montane habitat. African Journal of Ecology, 25(1), 35-45. Although quite common and adaptable, jackal buzzards are not infrequently endangered by large man-made objects such as wind turbines, power-lines and steep-sided, massive reservoirs, in addition to poisoning of carcasses (targeted at jackals).Simmons, R., K.

Causes of admissions to a raptor rehabilitation centre in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. African Zoology, 48(2), 359-366. Behaviour Taking flight near Greyton, South Africa Pairs have noisy aerial displays, including outside the breeding season. However the aerial display of the pair on territory tends to be much less dramatic than that of the augur buzzard, usually confined to circling or gentle stooping. The breeding season peaks in July to December, but can range from as early as from May to as late as March.Brown, Leslie and Amadon, Dean (1986) Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World. The Wellfleet Press. . The large stick nest is built in a tree or on a crag, and is often reused and enlarged in subsequent seasons. At first construction the nest with average about across and deep but easily can exceed in diameter with repeated uses.Schmitt, M. B., Baur, S., & von Maltttz, F. (1987). Observations on the Jackal Buzzard in the Karoo. Ostrich, 58(3), 97-102. Two creamy or bluish white eggs (or very rarely three) are laid at about three day intervals and incubated by the female only, although food is brought to her on the nest by the male. A surveys of egg sizes show they average with a range in height of and in diameter of . The eggs hatch in about 40 days, after a further 56‚Äì60 days they can attempt flight. The parents will attack intruders, including humans, who come too close to the nest. Siblicide has been widely reported but, presumably when food supply is ample, nests often produce two fledglings. At 70 days they become independent of the nest, but young birds may then be seen with the adult pair for some time. As in other tropical raptors compared to temperate- zone relatives, the breeding cycle is relatively elongated and clutch size relatively small in the jackal buzzard compared to temperate-zone Buteo species.Visagie, R. (2009). Growth and development of a Jackal Buzzard Buteo rufofuscus chick in the eastern Nama Karoo. Gabar 20:20-25. Dietary habits An immature Jackal Buzzard. The diet of the jackal buzzard is led mainly by small ground mammals, especially rodents. Other prey may include snakes, lizards, ground-feeding birds such as sandgrouse and gamebirds (or alternately the nestlings and fledglings of other birds), insects, and road-kills. Typically, this raptor still-hunts by dropping on its prey from a perch, often either trees or roadside poles or posts. It takes its prey almost exclusively on bare ground, including roads. It also may hunt by soaring or periodically hovering or hanging on updrafts.Dean, W. R. J., & Milton, S. J. (2003). The importance of roads and road verges for raptors and crows in the Succulent and Nama-Karoo, South Africa. Ostrich-Journal of African Ornithology, 74(3-4), 181-186.Frost, P.G.H. (1967). Jackal Buzzard Buteo rufofuscus hovering. Ostrich, 38:204. A study from Grahamstown, South Africa found the prey around nest to consist of assorted rat species (21 items), four-striped grass mouse (8 items) and two golden moles. On evidence, the jackal buzzard mainly takes small mammals during the nesting cycle and then switches to a largely carrion- based diet during the non-breeding season. Jackal buzzards have been recorded at various carrion, including many sheep and goat carcasses and placenta, as well as largely road-killed hares, springhares, springboks and steenboks. Despite being often recorded at carrion, the numerous scavengers in their range, largely vultures, jackals and occasionally hyenas, are larger and often aggressive towards other scavengers. Therefore, the jackal buzzard either only comes to carrion when other scavengers are done feasting or are entirely absent. They have an advantage in being less shy towards humans than larger birds of prey and scavengers and may be able to come to road-kills more quickly and may also gain an advantage in accessing large carcasses that they may not be able to penetrate without larger scavengers opening them up first.Kendall, C. J. (2013). Alternative strategies in avian scavengers: how subordinate species foil the despotic distribution. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 67(3), 383-393.Tarboton, D. G. (1984). The status and conservation of birds of prey in the Transvaal. Transvaal Museum Monographs, 3(1). Larger and/or more dangerous live prey recorded to be taken by jackal buzzards has included adults of birds such as francolins and marsh owls, adult puff adders, adult greater cane rats and largely or exclusively the young of various mongoose, monitor lizards and Cape hyraxes.Bing, M.

Wing areas, wing loadings and wing spans of 66 species of African raptors. Ostrich, 60(1), 35-42. The adult augur buzzard is strikingly plumaged and essentially unmistakable if seen well. It is an almost black brown above with a rufous tail that stands out strongly in contrast. The primary flight feathers are blackish and the secondaries off-white, both barred with black. Below the chin and around the throat is mainly white, and the rest of the underparts and the underwing coverts are rich rufous. The flight feathers from below are white, tipped with black to form a dark trailing edge to the wing. The juvenile augur buzzard is mainly brown above and rufous brown below and on the tail. It can be confused with wintering steppe buzzard, but the augur is considerably larger and bulkier with broader wings and a heavier flight style and an unbarred undertail. Although not as dark as the adult on the back and upperwing coverts, it is usually noticeably darker than a juvenile steppe buzzard. The adult augur buzzard has white underparts and underwings. The female has black on the lower throat. Juveniles are brown above and buff below, the underparts later becoming white. Juveniles are similar to juvenile jackal buzzards but are generally much paler below with bolder carpal patches and more clearly barred secondaries and tail. There is a melanistic form of augur buzzard, all black, except for grey and white flight feathers that are barred black and contrast strongly with the black center and a chestnut tail. About 10% of birds are melanistic, but the proportion rises in forested areas with high rainfall to as much as 50% in some areas. A somewhat similar melanistic morph of jackal buzzard is also known and these birds can very hard to distinguish, perhaps only told apart by the stronger barring on the melanistic augur pale flight feathers. Dark morph long-legged buzzards may also be confused for melanistic augur buzzards but are clearly more slender in the wing, less blackish on the body and lack the bold rufous tail.Lendrum, A. L. (1979). The augur buzzard in the Matopos, Rhodesia. Ostrich, 50(4), 203-214. Range and habitat Gatamayu Forest - Kenya The augur buzzard is found in eastern and southwestern Africa. Despite its erratic looking distribution, it is often common in its range. The augur buzzard is found from eastern Sudan and Ethiopia (also northern Somalia) down through the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, parts of Tanzania into Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, western Angola and west-central Namibia. Despite its wide range in southern Africa it appears to only occur in South Africa as a vagrant.Layard, E. L. (1884). The birds of South Africa. Bernard Quartich. The augur buzzard is found in open or light wooded upland areas but can also range into lowland deserts at sea level (such as in Namibia) and some more mountainous, precipitous areas of eastern Africa. By preference, they seem to prefer to hunt in elevated savanna grasslands, high moorland, cropland sometimes into open forest or deserts as well. Augur buzzards in east Africa usually live between elevation but normally occur above and have been recorded living at in Ethiopia. Behaviour An augur buzzard in Serengeti National Park. Pairs have noisy aerial displays, including outside the breeding season. Their call is quite different from their cousin, the jackal buzzard, and most other birds of prey, being a harsh, resonant crow-like a-kow a-kow a-kow or a-ung a-ung a-ung, drawn out as aerial display escalates into a longer, higher-pitched a-waaa a-waaa a-waaa.Brown, Leslie and Amadon, Dean (1986) Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World. The Wellfleet Press. . Pairs of augur buzzards usually mate for life but some polygamy has been reported in the species.Paviour, J. (2013). Key factors that influence breeding performance in raptors. The Plymouth Student Scientist, 6(1), 398-411. The large (up to wide) stick nest is built in a tree or on a crag, and is often reused and enlarged in subsequent seasons. On average two (sometimes only one and rarely three) creamy or bluish white eggs are laid and incubated by the female only, although food is brought to her on the nest by the male. The eggs hatch in about 40 days, and after a further 56-60 days the chicks can attempt flight. At 70 days they become independent of the nest, but young birds may then be seen with the adult pair for some time. As is the case in other tropical raptors, the clutch size is relatively smaller and the reproductive cycle is relatively longer than in related species found in the temperate zones. The diet of the augur buzzard is quite varied and opportunistic, as is typical of most Buteo species. It catches most of its prey on the ground, either by still-hunting from perch or swooping down from a soaring flight or, occasionally, from a hovering flight. They may also forage on the ground for both insects and small vertebrates. The primary foods for augur buzzards seem to include either small, terrestrial mammals or reptiles, chiefly snakes and lizards. Other prey may include small ground birds (and sometimes the nestlings, fledglings or unwary adults of varied birds), insects, and road- kill. In Zimbabwe, 59% of the diet was reptiles while the remainder was mostly mammalian, lead by vlei rats. At one nest site there, lizards made up 35% of the foods and snakes 46%.Irwin, M. P. S. (1981).

Idioventricular means ‚Äúrelating to or affecting the cardiac ventricle alone‚Äù and refers to any ectopic ventricular arrhythmia. Accelerated idioventricular arrhythmias are distinguished from ventricular rhythms with rates less than 40 (ventricular escape) and those faster than 120 (ventricular tachycardia). Though some other references limit to between 60 and 100 beats per minute. It is also referred to as AIVR and \\"slow ventricular tachycardia.\\" It can be present at birth. However, it is more commonly associated with reperfusion after myocardial injury. AIVR is generally considered to be a benign abnormal heart rhythm. It is typically temporary and does not require treatment. Pathophysiology In the human heart the sinoatrial node is located at the top of the right atrium. The sinoatrial node is the first area of the heart to depolarize and to generate the action potential that leads to depolarization of the rest of the myocardium. Sinoatrial depolarization and subsequent propagation of the electrical impulse suppress the action of the lower natural pacemakers of the heart, which have slower intrinsic rates. The accelerated idioventricular rhythm occurs when depolarization rate of a normally suppressed focus increases to above that of the \\"higher order\\" focuses (the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node). This most commonly occurs in the setting of a sinus bradycardia. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm is the most common reperfusion arrhythmia in humans. However, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation remain the most important causes of sudden death following spontaneous restoration of antegrade flow. Prior to the modern practice of percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome, pharmacologic thrombolysis was more common and accelerated idioventricular rhythms were used as a sign of successful reperfusion. It is considered a benign arrhythmia especially in the setting of STEMI(where it is conventionally thought to be an indicator of reperfusion) that does not require intervention, though atrioventricular dyssynchrony can cause hemodynamic instability, which can be treated through overdrive pacing or atropine. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= AIVR appears similar to ventricular tachycardia with wide QRS complexes (QRS >0.12s) and a regular rhythm. It can most easily be distinguished from VT in that the rate is less than 120 and usually less than 100 bpm. There may or may not be AV dissociation depending on whether it is due to ventricular escape or AV block.

The area had originally been claimed and controlled by France, which had named it La Louisiane in honor of King Louis XIV in 1682. Spain secretly acquired the territory from France near the end of the Seven Years' War by the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). The actual transfer of authority was a slow process, and after Spain finally attempted to fully replace French authorities in New Orleans in 1767, French residents staged an uprising which the new Spanish colonial governor did not suppress until 1769. Spain also took possession of the trading post of St. Louis and all of Upper Louisiana in the late 1760s, though there was little Spanish presence in the wide expanses of the \\"Illinois Country\\". New Orleans was the main port of entry for Spanish supplies sent to American forces during the American Revolution, and Spain and the new United States disputed the borders of Louisiana and navigation rights on the Mississippi River for the duration of Spain's rule in the colony. New Orleans was devastated by large fires in 1788 and 1794 which destroyed most of the original wooden buildings in what is today the French Quarter. New construction was done in the Spanish style with stone walls and slate roofs, and new public buildings constructed during the city's Spanish period include several still standing today such as the St. Louis Cathedral, the Cabildo, and the Presbytere. Louisiana was later and briefly retroceded back to France under the terms of the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso (1800) and the Treaty of Aranjuez (1801). In 1802, King Charles IV of Spain published a royal bill on 14 October, effecting the transfer and outlining the conditions. Spain agreed to continue administering the colony until French officials arrived and formalized the transfer. After several delays, the official transfer of ownership took place at the Cabildo in New Orleans on 30 November 1803. Three weeks later on 20 December, another ceremony was held at the same location in which France transferred New Orleans and the surrounding area to the United States pursuant to the Louisiana Purchase. Upper Louisiana was officially transferred to France and then to the United States on Three Flags Day in St. Louis, which was a series of ceremonies held over two days on 9 and 10 March 1804.  History  Spain was largely a benign absentee landlord administering the territory from Havana, Cuba, and contracting out governing to people from many nationalities as long as they swore allegiance to Spain. During the American Revolutionary War, the Spanish funneled their supplies to the American revolutionists through New Orleans and the vast Louisiana territory beyond. In keeping with being absentee landlords, Spanish efforts to turn Louisiana into a Spanish colony were usually fruitless. For instance, while Spanish officially was the only language of government, the majority of the populace firmly continued to speak French. Even official business conducted at the Cabildo often lapsed into French, requiring an interpreter to be on hand. = Slavery = When Alejandro O'Reilly re-established Spanish rule in 1769, he issued a decree on 7 December of that year which banned the trade of Native American slaves. Although there was no movement toward abolition of the African slave trade, Spanish rule introduced a new law called coartaci√≥n, which allowed slaves to buy their freedom and that of others. A group of maroons led by Jean Saint Malo resisted re-enslavement from their base in the swamps east of New Orleans between 1780 and 1784. Pointe Coup√©e conspiracy On 4 May 1795, 57 slaves and 3 local white men were put on trial in Point Coupee. At the end of the trial 23 slaves were hanged, 31 slaves received a sentence of flogging and hard labor, and the three white men were deported, with two being sentenced to six years forced labor in Havana. Upper and Lower, or the Louisianas Spanish colonial officials divided Luisiana into Upper Louisiana (Alta Luisiana) and Lower Louisiana (Baja Luisiana) at 36¬∞ 35' North, about the latitude of New Madrid, Missouri. This was a higher latitude than during the French administration, for whom Lower Louisiana was the area south of about 31¬∞ North (the current northern boundary of the state of Louisiana) or the area south of where the Arkansas River joined the Mississippi River at about 33¬∞ 46' North latitude. In 1764, French fur trading interests founded St. Louis in what was then known as the Illinois Country. The Spanish referred to St. Louis as \\"the city of Illinois\\" and governed the region from St. Louis as the \\"District of Illinois\\".

The family lived on Royal Street in what is now called the \\"French Quarter\\". Louisiana State Museum To establish Spanish colonies in Louisiana, the Spanish military leader Bernardo de G√°lvez, governor of Louisiana at the time, recruited groups of Spanish-speaking Canary Islanders to emigrate to North America. In 1778, several ships embarked for Louisiana with hundreds of settlers. The ships made stops in Havana and Venezuela, where half the settlers disembarked (300 Canarians remained in Venezuela). In the end, between 2,100 and 2,736 Canarians arrived in Louisiana and settled near New Orleans. They settled in Barataria and in what is today St. Bernard Parish. However, many settlers were relocated for various reasons. Barataria suffered hurricanes in 1779 and in 1780; it was abandoned and its population distributed in other areas of colonial Louisiana (although some of its settlers moved to West Florida).Hern√°ndez Gonz√°lez, Manuel (2007). La emigraci√≥n canaria a Am√©rica [Canarian Emigration to the Americas] (in Spanish). pp. 15, 43‚Äì44 (Canarian emigration of Florida and Texas); p. 51 (Canarian emigration to Louisiana). First Edition In 1782, a splinter group of the Canarian settlers in Saint Bernard emigrated to Valenzuela. In 1779, another ship with 500 people from M√°laga (in Andalusia, Spain), arrived in Spanish Louisiana. These colonists, led by Lt. Col. Francisco Bouligny, settled in New Iberia, where they intermarried with Cajun settlers. In 1782, during the American Revolutionary War and the Anglo-Spanish War (1779‚Äì83), Bernardo de G√°lvez recruited men from the Canarian settlements of Louisiana and Galveston (in Spanish Texas, where Canarians had settled since 1779) to join his forces. They participated in three major military campaigns: the Baton Rouge, the Mobile, and the Pensacola, which expelled the British from the Gulf Coast. In 1790 settlers of mixed Canarian and Mexican origin from Galveston settled in Galveztown, Louisiana, to escape the annual flash floods and prolonged droughts of this area.  Immigration from Saint-Domingue  Beginning in the 1790s, following the slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) that began in 1791, waves of refugees came to Louisiana. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants from the island landed there, including ethnic Europeans, free people of color, and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by the white elites. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city.\\"The Slave Rebellion of 1791\\".

It may be performed with a bed of nails type test fixture and specialist test equipment, or with a fixtureless in-circuit test setup. Bed of nails tester A bed of nails tester is a traditional electronic test fixture which has numerous pins inserted into holes in an epoxy phenolic glass cloth laminated sheet (G-10) which are aligned using tooling pins to make contact with test points on a printed circuit board and are also connected to a measuring unit by wires. Named by analogy with a real-world bed of nails, these devices contain an array of small, spring-loaded pogo pins; each pogo pin makes contact with one node in the circuitry of the DUT (device under test). By pressing the DUT down against the bed of nails, reliable contact can be quickly and simultaneously made with hundreds or even thousands of individual test points within the circuitry of the DUT. The hold-down force may be provided manually or by means of a vacuum or a mechanical presser, thus pulling the DUT downwards onto the nails. Devices that have been tested on a bed of nails tester may show evidence of this after the process: small dimples (from the sharp tips of the Pogo pins) can often be seen on many of the soldered connections of the PCB. Bed of nails fixtures require a mechanical assembly to hold the PCB in place. Fixtures can hold the PCB with either a vacuum or pressing down from the top of the PCB. Vacuum fixtures give better signal reading versus the press-down type. On the other hand, vacuum fixtures are expensive because of their high manufacturing complexity. Moreover, vacuum fixtures cannot be used on bed-of- nails systems that are used in automated production lines, where the board is automatically loaded to the tester by a handling mechanism. The bed of nails or fixture, as generally termed, is used together with an in-circuit tester. Fixtures with a grid of 0.8 mm for small nails and test point diameter 0.6 mm are theoretically possible without using special constructions. But in mass production, test point diameters of 1.0 mm or higher are normally used to minimise contact failures leading to lower remachining costs. This technique of testing PCBs is being slowly superseded by boundary scan techniques (silicon test nails), automated optical inspection, and built-in self-test, due to shrinking product sizes and lack of space on PCB's for test pads. Nevertheless ICT is used in mass production to detect failures before doing end-of-line test and producing scrap. ICT failures & mechanical simulation In-circuit testing has been known to cause mechanical failures such as capacitor flex cracking and pad cratering. This typically occurs on a bed of nails tester if there is excessive board flexure due to poor support placement or high probe forces. It can be challenging to optimize for ideal support locations and probe forces without spending resources designing and building an ICT fixture. Current methods typically employ strain gaging or similar techniques to monitor board flexure. More recently, some have looked at finite element simulation to proactively design or adjust an ICT fixture to avoid these mechanical failure modes. This approach can be implemented as part of a design for manufacturability methodology to provide rapid feedback on ICT design and reduce costs.

Such additional hardware includes: * Cameras to test for presence and correct orientation of components * Photodetectors to test for LED color and intensity * External timer counter modules to test very high frequencies (over 50 MHz) crystals and oscillators * Signal waveform analysis, e.g. slew rate measurement, envelope curve etc. * External equipment can be used for hi-voltage measurement (more than 100Vdc due to limitation of voltage that is provided) or AC equipment Source those have interface to PC as the ICT Controller * Bead probe technology to access small traces that cannot be accessed by traditional means  Limitations  While in-circuit test is a very powerful tool for testing PCBs, it has these limitations: * Parallel components can often only be tested as one component if the components are of the same type (i.e. two resistors); though different components in parallel may be testable using a sequence of different tests - e.g. a DC voltage measurement versus a measurement of AC injection current at a node. * Electrolytic components can be tested for polarity only in specific configurations (e.g. if not parallel connected to power rails) or with a specific sensor * The quality of electrical contacts can not be tested unless extra test points and/or a dedicated extra cable harness are provided. * It is only as good as the design of the PCB. If no test access has been provided by the PCB designer then some tests will not be possible. See Design For Test guidelines.

He attended Liberty High School in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. and was selected to the All State Team in 1975. After high school, he was recruited by many top colleges but elected to play at Penn State because of Coach Bahr‚Äôs honesty that Stamatis would need to earn a place on the team. Stamatis did work hard and developed into one of the top collegiate forwards. In 1978, Stamatis was named as a first team All American. The following year, Stamatis was selected as the 1979 winner of the Hermann Trophy, awarded annually to the most outstanding player in all of American college soccer. Penn State also made it to the NCAA championship semifinals that year before losing to eventual winners SIU-E. National team His outstanding play with Penn State brought him to the attention of the national team and he was called up to the U-23 national team at the 1979 Pan American Games and for preparations for the 1980 Summer Olympics.

He only played a year in the league before moving to the Denver Avalanche of Major Indoor Soccer League and the Pennsylvania Stoners of the American Soccer League before back injuries cut short his playing career. Post-soccer career He had failed to complete his degree while at Penn State, so he decided to enter the New Jersey Institute of Technology where he graduated with a Civil Engineering degree in 1985. His choice of school was influenced by the fact that his fianc√©e, now wife, was from New Jersey. While in New Jersey, Stamatis continued his association with soccer, now as a coach rather than as a player. He became an assistant coach with the school‚Äôs men's soccer team. Stamatis became a civil engineer for the Louis Berger Group and rose to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. While he did not continue to coach soccer after graduating from NJIT, he got back into coaching when his children began playing.

In 1938, he led Claremont to its first-ever premiership, and repeated the feat in the next two seasons.

It was built in 1977 at a cost of ¬£2.5 million. Type The Beck is a community theatre, offering one-night concerts, drama, comedy, dance, musicals, children's shows, films, opera, pantomime, and a children's summer project. History The Beck Theatre was built in 1977 by Hillingdon Borough Council, with a bequest from Councillor Alfred Beck. It was purpose-built as a community-focused theatre, and is set in a parkland aspect adjoining a botanical garden (the Norman Leddy Memorial Gardens). The Beck was one of forty buildings considered for the Royal Institute of British Architects London region award in 1978, and in 2004 won an Access Award from Hillingdon Council for its resources for disabled and elderly people. A fund shortage threatened the theatre's future in 1984, when it was saved by a local petition. It was taken over in 1986 by impresario Charles Vance. The management contract passed then to Hetherington Seelig, followed by Apollo Leisure in 1992 (later bought out by Clear Channel Entertainment). In 2006, the Beck reverted to Hetherington Seelig in a partnership with Qdos Entertainment called HQ Theatres, which continues to run the theatre on behalf of the local council.

Mark-compact algorithms can be regarded as a combination of the mark-sweep algorithm and Cheney's copying algorithm. First, reachable objects are marked, then a compacting step relocates the reachable (marked) objects towards the beginning of the heap area. Compacting garbage collection is used by Microsoft's Common Language Runtime and by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. Algorithms After marking the live objects in the heap in the same fashion as the mark-sweep algorithm, the heap will often be fragmented. The goal of mark-compact algorithms is to shift the live objects in memory together so the fragmentation is eliminated. The challenge is to correctly update all pointers to the moved objects, most of which will have new memory addresses after the compaction. The issue of handling pointer updates is handled in different ways. = Table-based compaction = Illustration of the table-heap compaction algorithm. Objects that the marking phase has determined to be reachable (live) are colored, free space is blank. A table-based algorithm was first described by Haddon and Waite in 1967. It preserves the relative placement of the live objects in the heap, and requires only a constant amount of overhead. Compaction proceeds from the bottom of the heap (low addresses) to the top (high addresses). As live (that is, marked) objects are encountered, they are moved to the first available low address, and a record is appended to a break table of relocation information. For each live object, a record in the break table consists of the object's original address before the compaction and the difference between the original address and the new address after compaction. The break table is stored in the heap that is being compacted, but in an area that are marked as unused. To ensure that compaction will always succeed, the minimum object size in the heap must be larger than or the same size as a break table record. As compaction progresses, relocated objects are copied towards the bottom of the heap. Eventually an object will need to be copied to the space occupied by the break table, which now must be relocated elsewhere. These movements of the break table, (called rolling the table by the authors) cause the relocation records to become disordered, requiring the break table to be sorted after the compaction is complete. The cost of sorting the break table is O(n log n), where n is the number of live objects that were found in the mark stage of the algorithm. Finally, the break table relocation records are used to adjust pointer fields inside the relocated objects. The live objects are examined for pointers, which can be looked up in the sorted break table of size n in O(log n) time if the break table is sorted, for a total running time of O(n log n). Pointers are then adjusted by the amount specified in the relocation table. = LISP2 algorithm = In order to avoid O(n log n) complexity, the LISP2 algorithm uses 3 different passes over the heap. In addition, heap objects must have a separate forwarding pointer slot that is not used outside of garbage collection. After standard marking, the algorithm proceeds in the following 3 passes: # Compute the forwarding location for live objects. #* Keep track of a free and live pointer and initialize both to the start of heap. #* If the live pointer points to a live object, update that object's forwarding pointer to the current free pointer and increment the free pointer according to the object's size. #* Move the live pointer to the next object #* End when the live pointer reaches the end of heap. # Update all pointers #* For each live object, update its pointers according to the forwarding pointers of the objects they point to. # Move objects #* For each live object, move its data to its forwarding location. This algorithm is O(n) on the size of the heap; it has a better complexity than the table-based approach, but the table- based approach's n is the size of the used space only, not the entire heap space as in the LISP2 algorithm. However, the LISP2 algorithm is simpler to implement.

He was a Grandmaster of the World Bridge Federation, and the only player to have won both the Bermuda Bowl (the world championship for national teams) and the World Senior Pairs championship. He won the European teams championship on four occasions as part of the British team. Boris Schapiro (left) and Irving Gordon, winners of the Senior Pairs, 10th World Championships in Lille, France. Schapiro is wearing the same jacket that he wore decades previously when he won his first world championship.  Life  Schapiro was born in Riga, Latvia (then part of the Russian Empire) into a prosperous family of Jewish traders. They emigrated at the time of the Russian Revolution, when he was eight years old, and soon settled in England. He was educated at Clifton College and Bradford Technical College in England and at various universities, including the Sorbonne in Paris. After graduating, Schapiro joined the family horse trading and meat business and worked there until his forties, when he retired to capitalise on his love of gambling by becoming the banker of a baccarat syndicate at Crockford's gaming club in London. He was fluent in Russian, German and French, and used those linguistic skills in the Army Intelligence Corps during World War II. In 1935, while he was working in Hamburg, his fluency in German led to his being chosen as the interpreter for Viscount Castlerosse when the latter travelled to Berlin to research an article for the Daily Express. In a restaurant, a group of Brownshirts mistook Castlerosse for a Jew and Schapiro for a non-Jew, and abused Castlerosse for drinking with an Aryan. A fight broke out, and as a result Schapiro spent two nights in prison, after which he hastily returned to Britain.Shireen Mohandes. \\"The First Sunday Times Invitational Pairs, 1963.\\" Bridge. August 2015. Page 33. Schapiro had an early marriage to a Russian woman. He later married a second time, to Helen, in 1970.  Bridge career  At age ten in England, Schapiro started playing bridge for money at school. His first major tournament was in 1929, when he went to the USA to partner Oswald Jacoby in the World Auction Bridge Pairs Championship. The two players were destined to have great and lengthy careers in the coming world of contract bridge, where Schapiro's first recorded victory was in the World Pairs Championship of 1932, also with Jacoby. (This was before the foundation of the World Bridge Federation, 1957, which has sanctioned all \\"World\\" tournaments for many years.) Schapiro's entry into serious competitive bridge in Britain was delayed until the end of the war. His partnership with Terence Reese, which started in about 1944,Reese, Terence (1977). Bridge at the Top. London: Faber & Faber. Page 36. was the basis of his most outstanding period as a player. He was also successful with other partners, the last of which was Irving \\"Haggis\\" Gordon. Schapiro's bidding in competitive situations was quite outstanding, and his commentary was featured in bridge magazine bidding competitions round the world. Bidding judgement and card-play in defence were the strengths of his game, relative to other experts. :\\"The characters of Reese and Schapiro were very different. At the bridge table Reese was the cold calculating machine, driven by logic, but witty and good-natured away from it, though with an acerbic phrase when needed. Schapiro was the player of flair; excitable, always on the move, irascible at the table and often grumpy away from it. He did not mellow with old age. At the 1999 European Senior Teams, opponents who called the referee in a vain attempt to protect Schapiro's partner from verbal abuse were told there were special dispensations in standards of behaviour for any competitor over the age of 90.\\" = Major tournament successes = Schapiro won many tournaments. His first major win at was Britain's Gold Cup in 1945/46, partnered by Iain Macleod. He won the Gold Cup eleven times in all, at the time a record, and his last win came at the age of 88 in 1997/98, a remarkable 52 years after his first and 33 years after his penultimate success. Britain won the world championship for teams in 1955 with Reese and Schapiro, Konstam and Dodds, Meredith and Pavlides, beating the USA in the final. It is the only Bermuda Bowl win for a British team. Schapiro also won the World Mixed Teams in 1962. At the age of 89 in 1998, he won the World Senior Pairs partnered by Irving Gordon. He was second in the inaugural renditions of both quadrennial open world championship tournaments under the WBF, the World Team Olympiad of 1960 and the World Open Pairs of 1962. He also represented Britain in the 1964 Olympiad and the Bermuda Bowl of the same year, which was played early in 1965, and in ten European Bridge League national teams championships, winning in 1948, 1949, 1954 and 1963. Although the British team had won the Bermuda Bowl in 1955, Schapiro's 1965 experience was altogether different. = Buenos Aires affair = In the 1965 Buenos Aires Bermuda Bowl, B. Jay Becker noticed Schapiro and his partner, Terence Reese, holding their cards in unusual ways during bidding, the number of fingers showing indicating length of the heart suit. A number of players and observers, including Dorothy Hayden, New York Times columnists Alan Truscott, John Gerber, British nonplaying captain Ralph Swimer, British Bridge League Chairman Geoffrey Butler, ACBL president emeritus Waldemar von Zedtwitz, and ACBL President Robin McNabb, all watched Reese and Schapiro and were convinced that they were signalling illegally. It was also confirmed that Reese was not using such signals while playing with his other partner, Jeremy Flint. At a hearing held at the tournament site in Buenos Aires, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) judged Reese and Schapiro guilty of cheating, and announced that due to \\"certain irregularities\\", he British team was forfeiting the matches they had already won against North America and Argentina, and that Reese and Schapiro would not be playing in the remaining matches. The British Bridge League (BBL) subsequently convened their own enquiry, chaired by Sir John Foster, barrister and Member of Parliament, and General Lord Bourne. After hearing lasting many months, including a surprise revelation by Swimer that Schapiro had confessed his guilt to him, the \\"Foster Enquiry\\" found insufficient evidence to find Reese and Schapiro guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Without rebutting the \\"direct\\" evidence that grips were correlated with heart count, the report emphasized that there was inconclusive evidence that the players had benefitted from the signals in their bidding or play. In 1967, the BBL asked the WBF to reverse their guilty finding; the WBF responded by unanimously reaffirming their guilty verdict, and later reiterating that they would not accept a British team including Reese and Schapiro for the 1968 Olympiad, which the BBL boycotted in protest. In 1968, a compromise was reached, the WBF maintaining their guilty verdict, but allowing Reese and Schapiro (who had announced his retirement from international bridge after the Buenos Aires Olympiad) to play in future world championships. Subsequently, both Reese Reese, Terence (1966). The Story of an Accusation. London: Heinemann. LCCN 67075048. 244 pages. (US edition, 1967). New York: Simon & Schuster. LCCN 67017872. 246 pages.and Alan TruscottTruscott, Alan (1969). The Great Bridge Scandal. Yarborough Press. published books on the scandal. Reese's book stated: \\"The basis of the charge, as everybody knows, is that Schapiro and I communicated length in hearts to one another by means of illegal signals. If you want to support that charge by reference to the hands played, what you have to show is that a number of illogical, uncharacteristic, and implausible bids or plays were made that can be explained only on the basis that the players had improper knowledge of one another's hands.\\" It then goes on to argue for the logic of the pair's bidding and play on the various hands from the Olympiad. Truscott's book emphasizes the unlikelihood of the observed variations in finger signals being coincidental, or of such a large number of witnesses colluding to fabricate the evidence. In May 2005, the English journalist David Rex-Taylor, a bridge player and publisher, claimed that Reese had made a confession to him forty years earlier, one that was not to be revealed until 2005 and after he and Schapiro were dead.Alder, Philip.\\"Cheating Scandal From '65 Rears Head Again\\". The New York Times. 20 Jun 2005. The purported confession claimed that Reese and Schapiro were indeed signalling, but only to show that such signaling was possible (and so were not actually paying attention to each other's signals), purportedly as part of a book on cheating (which was abandoned after the scandal broke). Although this explanation could conceivably reconcile the use of finger signals with the absence of evidence from bidding or play, there is no corroborating evidence to support this account. In contrast, Schapiro's widow claims he continued to deny the accusations to his death.\\"The Buenos Aires affair: Card Tricksters\\". The Independent. 11 May 2005. = After 1965 = Schapiro was bridge correspondent of The Sunday Times from 1968 until his death in 2002. Despite his facility with language, he was never really interested in writing; his output was two small books, and it is likely that his newspaper column was often ghosted. He made his mark as a player and a personality. The Buenos Aires affair removed at a stroke the central activity of his life. It took years for Schapiro to be rehabilitated in world bridge, although he was always held in high esteem in Europe. He did eventually return to international bridge competition, unlike Reese, and did so with considerable success (above). Schapiro's 90th birthday party in London was attended by Jaime Ortiz- Patino, the WBF President Emeritus and the owner of Valderrama Golf Club, who had been a witness for Reese and Schapiro in the BBL enquiry; Omar Sharif, the Egyptian film star and bridge player; Prince Khalid Abudullah of Saudi Arabia, a family friend; and many personalities from the bridge and casino worlds. = Anecdotes = Schapiro's conversation at the bridge table was either a delight or a nuisance, depending on taste and point of view. His standard greeting to females ‚Äì \\"What about a spot of adultery?\\" (or \\"Fancy a spot of adultery?\\") ‚Äì is mentioned in every biographical note and obituary, and reveals his sense of humour. When his team played an exhibition match at Leicester, the wife of the Chief Constable organised a cocktail party for them to meet the locals. The traveling players were invited to sign and comment in the Visitors book, and Schapiro wrote the catchphrase after his signature. Dimmie Fleming ‚Äì another international player and the only woman to play on the British open team ‚Äì defused the situation by signing next, drawing an upwards arrow and writing, \\"But will he ever be adult?\\"Ramsay, Guy (1955). Aces All. London: Museum Press. Page 149. Another story shows his partner Terence Reese picking up a collection of silver cup trophies from Schapiro's flat in Eaton Place (the Upstairs, Downstairs setting) and carrying them in a pillow-case. Stopped in the street by a policeman and asked to explain his unusual sack of possessions, Reese led the officer back to the flat so that Schapiro could validate his explanation. When Schapiro answered the door, he sized up the situation, and when asked \\"Can you identify this man?\\", said \\"Never seen him before in my life.\\" Books * Bridge, Card by Card (London: Hamlyn, 1969), Terence Reese and Schapiro * Bridge Analysis (US edition, New York: Sterling Pub, (c) 1976), 187 pp. * Boris Schapiro on Bridge (London:Pitman, 1976), 190 pp. References Further reading * Reese, Terence (1966): The story of an accusation.

The film features one theme song by the title of \\"Under A Texas Moon.\\" The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Under a Texas Moon Plot Frank Fay, as a Mexican named Don Carlos, rides into a small Texas border settlement on the Fourth of July in the early 1880s. He is accompanied by his two inseparable companions, played by Georgie Stone and George Cooper. The day is being celebrated in the style of a Spanish fiesta. Fay challenges a rough Texan, played by Noah Beery, to a duel, only to find himself invited to undertake the dangerous task of capturing a cattle rustler who has been stealing cattle from the Lazy Y Ranch. He accepts the task on the promise of receiving $7000 in gold if he can return both the thief and the stolen cattle within 10 days. During the next nine days, Fay spends his time making love to every pretty girl he meets, serenading many of them by singing the theme song to the film while playing his guitar, while his two companions join in the harmonizing. He lies to them all, telling each girl exactly what she wishes to hear. Throughout all this time, he does nothing towards earning his reward. On the 10th day, he captures the cattle rustler and turns up the cattle to everyone's surprise by using a simple method of which no one had thought. He rides back to Mexico with his latest conquest in his arms.

Response New York Latinos led by Gonzalo Gonz√°lez protested the film, characterizing it as \\"anti-Mexican\\" mainly because Frank Fay portrayed Mexicans as being liars and womanizers. Police brutalized the picketers, killing Gonz√°lez. The murder sparked a pan-Latino protest, in which the Latino civil rights activist Luisa Moreno participated. She later told Bert Corona that the experience \\"motivated her to work on behalf of unifying the Spanish-speaking communities.\\" See also *List of early color feature films References  External links  * * Category:1930 films Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films based on American novels Category:1930s color films Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels Category:Films set in the 1880s Category:Films set in Texas Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Michael Curtiz Category:1930s Western (genre) musical films Category:American Western (genre) musical films Category:Early color films ","title":"Under a Texas Moon"},{"id":"9854041","text":"Joseph M. \\"Joe Jr.\\" Morrone. is a former U.S. soccer midfielder.

Fly by Night won the Branford Boase Award in 2006, and was listed in the School Library Journal's Best Books of 2006. It was shortlisted for the 2006 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, as was its sequel Twilight Robbery in 2011. Hardinge's comic fantasy is set in the grotesque imaginary world of The Realm, which, as she writes in an after note, bears some similarity to early 18th century England. As religion, the people venerate numerous small deities known as the Beloved, each sacred to a part of a day in the year. Children must be named for the Beloved in whose time they are born, though a degree of fraud occurs to obtain a better name. This religion has been restored following a period when a militant movement, the Bird-catchers, sought to impose their own puritanical religion, leading to a civil war in which the Bird-catchers were defeated. The novel takes place at a time when the monarchy has been overthrown and The Realm has fractured into city states such as Mandelion, where the guilds, especially the Stationers and Locksmiths, act as power brokers. Numerous claimants to the throne are recognized and locally supported, but more by tradition than genuine desire for restoration. Mandelion is currently ruled by Duke Vocado Avourlace, brother of Lady Tamarind, and supporter of the claim of the Twin Princesses. He remains unmarried since being turned down by one of them.  Synopsis  Mosca is the daughter of Quillam Mye, an exiled writer and radical political agitator, who taught her to read but died when she was eight. She was born in the hours sacred to Goodman Palpitattle, He Who Keeps Flies out of Jams and Butterchurns, and thus was given the name Mosca, Italian for fly. Now twelve and living with her uncle, a miller, she yearns for the city education her father promised. She sees her opportunity when poet and conman Eponymous Clent comes to their village, and is locked overnight in the stocks. She steals the keys and releases Clent, accidentally burning down the mill which creates a useful distraction. In return, Clent agrees to give her a job, and bring her to Mandelion. She takes her fierce goose Saracen to face down the guard-dogs. Clent tries to lose Mosca, but soon learns she is useful to him and accepts her. Mosca and Clent have an adventurous journey to Mandelion. On the way, they encounter Lady Tamarind's coach held up by Black Captain Blythe, a highwayman. Clent negotiates their safe passage, finding a way to gain the gratitude of both parties. In Mandelion, a hornet's nest of political intrigue, crime and corruption, they lodge in a marriage house, which arranges weddings for people who can't afford a church. Clent has been contracted as an informer for the Stationers‚Äô Guild, who want him to find out the origin of illegal anonymous leaflets which promote a radical cause. They suspect it is some kind of provocation organised by their rivals the Locksmiths‚Äô Guild. Unable to find a school to take her, Mosca agrees to work as Clent's spying assistant, and becomes entangled in the politics. Saracen is employed to take part in a beast-fight at an inn, to help Clent find out what is going on there. They become inconveniently implicated in the murder of Partridge, a barge captain who transported Saracen to Mandelion, while also smuggling lead for rebels to make bullets. Investigating this leads Mosca to identify the rebels, thereby uncovering a plot quite different from what anyone suspected. The resolution of it produces a surprising regime change. In the end, having made too many enemies, Clent has to leave Mandelion. Mosca chooses life on the road with Clent, thus providing a lead to the sequel Twilight Robbery.  Characters  *Mosca Mye - the heroine of the story who has run away from home after burning her uncle's mill down. Her father died when she was 8. She is determined and devious. *Saracen - Mosca's ill-tempered goose. *Eponymous Clent - a travelling wordsmith and conman of dubious repute, who has been employed to act as a spy for the Stationers. *Quillam Mye - Mosca's father, who didn't believe in the Beloved, the numerous deities of The Realm. Died when Mosca was eight, his radical books of freedom burnt. *Black Captain Blythe - a not-so-villainous highwayman. *Lady Tamarind Avourlace - sister of the Duke of Mandelion and political schemer. She keeps a crocodile in her rooms in place of a guard-dog. *Mabwick Toke - head of the Stationers' Guild in Mandelion. *Aramai Goshawk - leading agent of the Locksmiths' Guild. *Hopewood Pertellis - a young lawyer and head of an illegal school that teaches children to read. *Vocado Avourlace - current Duke of Mandelion, who is obsessed with the Twin Princesses and slowly going mad. *Linden Kohlrabi - an aide to Lady Tamarind who tries to befriend Mosca.  Factions  *Guilds - The Realm is held together by the guilds, who act as power brokers. Every tradesman from watchmakers to playing card makers to millers belong to the guilds. Their present policy is to pay lip-service to the monarchy while in practice preventing it from reestablishing itself. *Stationers' Guild - originally makers of stationery, after the Bird-catcher wars they were given power over all printed material. They control all printing presses and everything from handbills to news sheets to books must be approved by the Guild who affix their seal to it. Anything without the Stationers' seal is deemed illegal and destroyed. *Locksmiths' Guild - once they only made locks and strongboxes, but now act as a mafia providing a wider range of security services. A Locksmith will always wears gloves as the outline of a key is branded on his right palm. The head of each cell wears chatelaine at his waist which match the brands of all the men that answer to him. The Locksmiths have taken complete control of the neighboring city of Scurrey, and are feared to be scheming to do the same in Mandelion. *Company of Watermen - control all movement along the river. *Bird-catchers - a militant religious movement that came to power after the fall of the monarchy. They plunged the Realm into a ten-year war against those they considered heretical, which cost the lives of tens of thousands. They were believed to have been killed, but actually they went into hiding, and eventually started a new plot against the Realm. *Radicals - a republican political movement in favor of freedom of speech and freedom from imposed religion. Sometimes confused with the Bird-catchers, because they share some philosophies in common, though in fact bitter enemies.

She was the daughter of John, Duke of Berry, and Joanna of Armagnac. She was married three times. She acted as administrator of the Duchy of Bourbon for her third spouse John I, Duke of Bourbon, during his imprisonment in England after he was captured following the French defeat at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, until 1434. Life Marie was born about the year 1375,: section \\"Marie\\"Jean Froissart, Chronicles calls her a \\"child\\" when she first married in 1386 (citation to verify) and estimates that she was \\"about 23\\" when her second spouse Philippe of Artois died in 1397 the youngest daughter of John \\"the Magnificent\\", Duke of Berry and Joanna of Armagnac. Through her father, a great collector of antiquities, art patron and bibliophile, she was a granddaughter of King John II of France. She had three brothers, Charles, Louis, and John; and one older sister, Bonne. The wedding of Philip of Artois and Marie of Berry. Jean Froissart, Chroniques: BL Harleian MS 4380 f. 6r Palais de la Cit√© where she was married may be the building in the centre background. Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry: Mus√©e Cond√© =Countess consort of Ch√¢tillon= The first of Marie's three marriages took place on 29 May 1386 in the Cathedral of Saint-Etienne at Bourges: aged about 11, Marie married Louis III de Ch√¢tillon as her first husband. Marie's father gave her a dowry of 70,000 francs; he gave Louis, his son-in-law, the county of Dunois.: section \\"Marie\\" and footnotes 357-358 The marriage and trousseau had been arranged by the two fathers in 1384: \\"A Duke will dress her, in bed and out of it, and a Count will put the jewels on her\\", John Duke of Berry and Guy Count de Blois-Ch√¢tillon agreed. The festivities at the wedding de ces jeunes enfants (\\"of these young children\\") are described in Jean Froissart's Chronicles. =Countess of Eu= There were no children from this marriage, and Louis died on 15 July 1391. On 27 January 1393 a marriage contract was drawn up for Marie and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu. They were married the next month at the Palais du Louvre in Paris; King Charles VI of France himself paid for the festivities, while her father gave her a dowry of 70,000 francs. They had two sons and two daughters. The King appointed Philip Constable in 1392. Philippe went on Crusade and fought alongside his friend Jean Le Maingre (\\"Boucicaut\\"), marshal of France at the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis on 25 September 1396. Both were captured, and Philip died some months later in captivity at Micalizo, now called Mihalƒ±√ß√ßƒ±k, in western Turkey. After Philippe's death inter Sarracenos (\\"among the Saracens\\"), his body was brought back to Eu, his home town, and Marie gave an endowment of ¬£100 annually to the Collegial Church of Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Laurent for a mass to be celebrated there on 17 June each year in his memory.Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France,vol. 23 (1894) p. 450 \\"Ex obituario ecclesiae Augensis\\" Their eldest son, Philippe, died on 23 December in the same year and is also buried in Eu.. Jointly with her widowed sister-in-law, Jeanne of Thouars, Marie was appointed guardian of the three surviving children of her marriage with Philippe: Charles, Bonne and Catherine. Aged about three, Charles succeeded his father as Count of Eu. His revenues were held for him until he came of age by three trustees: Marie herself, her father, and her uncle Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. =Duchess consort of Bourbon= Marie married her third husband John of Bourbon at the \\"King's Palace\\" (the Palais de la Cit√©) in Paris on 21 June 1401. The contract had been signed at Paris on 27 May 1400 after complex negotiations.: section \\"Marie\\" and footnote 359 She bore him three children.. He was appointed Grand Chamberlain of France on 18 March 1408 and succeeded his father as Duke of Bourbon on 19 August 1410. Marie's father had persuaded King Charles VI not to fight at the battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, but Marie's husband did fight, was captured, and spent the rest of his life in English captivity. Marie is believed to be depicted in one or possibly two full-page miniatures in the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, a lavishly-illustrated manuscript made for her father in the years after his sons' deaths. In the illustration for the month of April, the young noblemen and women in the foreground are grouped around a couple agreeing to be married. According to Patricia Stirnemann, referencing Saint-Jean Boudin, the scene, although not painted until about 1410, depicts the engagement of Marie with John of Bourbon in 1401. Raymond Cazelles disputes this, arguing that the couple are Marie's niece Bonne of Armagnac and Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans, who were to marry in 1411. A May Day celebration among nobles takes place in the foreground of the illustration for the month of May. Details appear to confirm that the house of Bourbon is represented. Both Cazelles and Stirnemann believe that the woman seen in the foreground, riding on a white horse and wearing a large white headdress, is Marie on the occasion of her marriage on 21 June 1401. These scholars do not agree as to which of the accompanying men is John of Bourbon. The buildings in the background have been variously identified, but G. Papertiant suggests that they are the Ch√¢telet, Conciergerie and Tour de l'Horloge in Paris, and at the centre the Palais de la Cit√© where Marie's wedding took place. A manuscript made for Marie's own use and presented to her in 1406 survives today as BnF, fr. 926. It is a short collection of Christian devotional works, beginning with Bonaventure's Stimulus amoris, translated into French by Simon de Courcy as the Traitie√© de l'esguillon d'amour divine. It includes a miniature of Marie and her daughter Bonne (aged about ten at this time) kneeling in prayer before the Virgin Mary. The manuscript is now in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.Catalogue entry and microfilm reproduction Marie also selected approximately 40 manuscripts from among her father's collection on his death, as she was still owed the 70,000 franc dowry from her second marriage. =Duchess of Auvergne and Countess of Montpensier= All three of Marie's brothers were dead before 1400, remarks on an inconsistency by P. van Kerrebrouck, who in his Les Valois (1990) p. 261 states that John died after his father, i.e. in 1416 or after, but in his La Maison de Bourbon: 1256-1987 (1987) p. 91 gives John's date of death as 1399. Cawley adds further evidence that John died before his father. which explains the complexity of the negotiations for her third marriage: she and her elder sister Bonne were to be heirs to John of Berry's titles, which required royal assent.:section \\"Marie\\" and footnotes 360-361 John of Berry died on 15 June 1416 (by which time Marie's husband was already a prisoner in England). Marie was accordingly appointed Duchess of Auvergne and Countess of Montpensier on 26 April 1418; these titles were confirmed in 1425. On 17 January 1421, her husband appointed her administrator of his estates as well. He died a prisoner in London in January 1434. Marie died in Lyon on an unknown date in June of the same year. She was buried at Souvigny Priory.

C√°diz (369,382) is the residence of the bishop.  History  C√°diz was raised by Urban IV to episcopal rank in 1263 at the request of king Alfonso X, a year after its Reconquista on the Moors. Its first bishop was Fray Juan Martinez. After the Christians had won from the Moors the Plaza (stronghold) de Algeciras, the ordinaries of C√°diz bore the title of Bishop of C√°diz and Algeciras, granted by Clement VI in 1352. The see counted amongst its prelates in 1441 Cardinal Juan de Torquemada, an eminent Dominican theologian jurisconsult, who took a leading part in the Council of Basle and Council of Florence, and defended in his \\"Summe de Ecclesi√¢\\" the direct power of the pope in temporal matters. On 1816.01.25, the bishopric lost territory to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Gibraltar, which had become a British colony. By the Concordat of 1851, the diocese of Ceuta, also suffragan of Seville, was joined with that of C√°diz, whose bishop was regularly Apostolic Administrator of Ceuta until the present dual name was adopted at the incorporation of Ceuta in 1933.

Night Stalker was ported to the Atari 2600 as Dark Cavern and released under Mattel's M Network label. Apple II and IBM PC versions were published in 1983.  Gameplay  The player controls a man trapped in a hedgerow maze with no exits and many threats, some natural such as bats and spiders, others artificial and more deadly in nature such as robots. The player starts out in a bunker in the middle of the map completely defenseless. A gun icon flashes at one of five random locations which he must pick up to arm himself. Each gun has six bullets. Once the ammunition has been exhausted, the gun icon will appear again and the player must move defenselessly through the maze to retrieve the new weapon. There are five different robots that the man encounters in accordance with the point total. The terrain is filled with corners and ambush points that players must use to full effect. There is also a spider web in the northwest corner where the spider enemy spawns. Player movement is hindered here, and all firepower is heavily suppressed within, making it a strategic location. Also of importance is the player's bunker, in which the player begins each life. The bunker is a safe zone and the player is impervious to damage while inside, though the more advanced robot adversaries have the firepower to destroy this safe haven. The game features only one unchanging level and no music, instead having a pulsing background beat playing back at a set interval that signals the speed chosen by the player. Legacy The Intellivision version was made available for the PlayStation 3 through PlayStation Home in fall 2012 in a collection titled Intellivision Gen2. In addition to being filled with bats and spiders, it had a greater variety of killer robots along with a variety of maze structures. An updated version of Night Stalker of the same name has been announced for release on the Intellivision Amico video game console in 2020.

The Chitai Golu Devta temple is the most celebrated temple dedicated to the deity and is about from the main gate of Binsar wildlife sanctuary & about from Almora.Binsar The other famous temple is located near Bhowali, next to the Sainik School, Ghorakhal. Golu dev used to travel far distances on his horse and used to meet people of his kingdom, Golu Darbar used to take place and Golu Dev used to hear the problems of the people and help them in any way possible, he had a special place for people in his heart and he was always ready to help them, due to his complete dedication to people, he led a very simple life and lived his life on the principles of brahmacharya. Golu dev still meet with his people and in many villages the practice of Golu darbar is still prevalent, where Golu dev appear in front of people and listen to their problem and help people in every way possible, the most common form of Golu Dev Darbar these days is Jagar. Golu Dev always had a special place for his White horse in his heart, he still do love his horse. So it is believed by many that he still travels on the back of his horse . He is the god of justice and he serves it well. That is why people worship him as The God of Justice \\"Jai Nyay Devta Goljyu Tumar Jai ho. Sabuk lije dain haije\\". Translation: Hail the God of justice: Goljyu! Blessings for everyone!  Origin  Golu Devta is considered as an incarnation of Gaur Bhairav (Shiva), and is worshipped all over the region. He is regarded as the dispenser of justice by the devotees with extreme faith. Historically, he is considered as a brave son and a general of Katyuri king, Jhal Rai and Kalinka. His grandfather was Hal Rai and great-grandfather was Hal Rai. Historically Champawat is considered as the origin of Golu Devta. His mother Kalinka is believed to be the sister of two other local deities Harishchand Devjyun (the divine spirit of Raja Harish of the Chands) and Sem Devjyun and both these deities are regarded as uncles of Lord Golu. Another legend suggests that he was a General in the army of Chand king, Baz Bahadur (1638‚Äì78), and died displaying exemplary valour at war, the temple at Chitai was erected in his honour, from Almora city. The most popular story about Golu talks of a local king who, while hunting, sent his servants to look for water. The servants disturbed a woman who was praying. The woman, in a fit of anger, taunted the king that he could not separate two fighting bulls and proceeded to do so herself. The king was very impressed by this deed and he married the lady. When this queen gave birth to a son, the other queens, who were jealous of her, placed a stone in its place and the child in a cage and put the cage into the river. The child was brought up by a fisherman. When the boy grew up he took a wooden horse to the river and on being questioned by the queens he replied that if women can give birth to stone then wooden horses can drink water. When the king heard about this, he punished the guilty queens and crowned the boy, who went on to be known as Golu devta. Golu Devta is seen in form of Lord Shiva, his brother Kalva Devta is in form on Bhairava and Garh Devi is form of Shakti. Golu Devta is also prayed as key deity(Ista/ Kula Devta) in many villages Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand. Normally three days pooja or 9 days pooja is performed to worship Lord Golu Devta also known as Goreel Devta in Chamoli District. Golu Devta is offered Ghee, Milk, Curd, Halwa, Poori, Pakauri and head of Goat sacrificed. Two Male Goat sacrifice ( Bali) is performed. Preferred black in colour. One in the temple of Golu devta and the other outside temple in remote location. The sacrificed goat is received as Prasada of pooja. Golu devta is known as God of justice and prayed with great pride and enthusiasm. Golu Devta is offered with White Cloths, white pagari and white shaal. There are many temples of Golu Devata in Kumaun, and the most popular are at Chitai, Champawat, Ghorakhal, Chamarkhan (Tehsil Tarikhet, District Almora). It is popular belief that Golu Devta dispenses quick justice to the devotee. Devotees in turn offer bells and sacrifice animals after the fulfillment of their wishes. Thousands of bells of every size can be seen hanging over the temple premises. Many devotees file a lot of written petitions daily, which are received by the temple.

Since its foundation in 1976 by nine independent Danish hauliers, the company has achieved rapid expansion and international presence, predominantly through a series of strategic competitor acquisitions, some of the most important ones being Samson Transport (1997), DFDS Dan Transport Group (2000), J.H.Bachmann (2004), Frans Maas (2006), ABX LOGISTICS (2008) and UTi Worldwide, Inc. in 2016. In April 2019, DSV signed an agreement to acquire Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG and the deal was closed in August 2019. With headquarters in Hedehusene (near Copenhagen), Denmark, and offices in more than 80 countries, DSV Panalpina employs 55,000 people and collaborates with partners and agents globally. The company is listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen (Copenhagen Stock Exchange) and included in the OMXC25 index as one of the 25 most traded stocks. The company is structured in three divisions, Road, Air & Sea, and Solutions. Its main activities lie within road transport (trucking) networks in Europe, North America and South Africa, and its global air and sea freight forwarding business. The group also has a growing contract logistics business. As part of an asset-light financial strategy to maintain fixed costs at a minimum and be able to quickly respond to market fluctuations, the group does not own any ships or aeroplanes and only a relatively small number of trucks and trailers. Jens Bj√∏rn Andersen became CEO in August 2008. In 2019, the company reported a net revenue of Euro 12.7 billion. History In 1976, Leif Tullberg and nine independent haulers established DSV, an acronym for ‚ÄúDe Sammensluttede Vognm√¶nd af 13-7 1976 A/S‚Äù (The Joint Hauliers of 13-7 1976). Leif Tullberg remained CEO until his retirement in 2005. He was succeeded by Kurt Larsen who became Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2008 when Jens Bj√∏rn Andersen took over as CEO. During the first decade the company mainly functioned as a cartage department for the owners, handling contracting haulage and deliveries. Seeking a foothold on the international market, DSV bought two competing export companies in 1989, Borup Autotransport A/S and Hammerbro A/S-Bech Trans. The next acquisitions on the road to becoming Pan- European were Samson Transport Co. A/S in 1997 and Svex Group A/S in 1999. The purchase of the DFDS Dan Transport Group in 2000 provided DSV with important road transport activities in Scandinavia, the UK, several Mainland European countries and the Baltics plus a global network including a logistics set-up. The purchase of J.H. Bachmann in 2005 reinforced the company's position within international air and sea transport. The acquisition of the Dutch Frans Maas Group in 2006 placed DSV as a truly Pan-European road transport and logistics supplier ‚Äì and one of the three largest in Europe. With the acquisition of ABX LOGISTICS in 2008, DSV got a foothold in South America and is now represented on six continents. With the acquisition of UTi Worldwide, Inc. in 2016 and Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG in 2019, the company became one of the world's four largest transport and logistics companies). On 1 April 2019, an acquisition agreement with Swiss Panalpina was announced valued at CHF 4.6 billion (‚Ç¨ 4.1 billion). On 19 August 2019, DSV announced that the acquisition of Panalpina was completed. On 2 July, 2020, DSV plans to invest approx. DKK2bn in a new logistics centre near Horsens, Europe‚Äôs largest with just one leaseholder. Company name When in 2000 DSV A/S acquired DFDS Dan Transport Group A/S, the new joint company's activities continued under the DFDS Transport name, while the parent company remained De Sammensluttede Vognm√¶nd (In English: The joint Hauliers) af 13-7 1976 A/S. In 2003, it was formally shortened to DSV A/S. In 2007, the name of the company's transport activities were also changed to DSV, to create a global brand and avoid confusion. On 24 September 2019, at an Extraordinary General Meeting, it was decided to change the company name from DSV A/S to DSV Panalpina A/S while maintaining DSV A/S as a second name. The name change only applies to the parent company. The DSV logo will remain unchanged.

LBOZ always lie in range <0,1> and has strong mathematical sense - it presents the amount of spectral signal which is not overlapped by the others. Hence, the uncertainty of a compound quantity increases by 1/\\\\xi in presence of the other compounds.

Life She grew up in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. In 1898, she travelled to Paris and Italy. She lived in Bloomsbury, and witnessed Black Friday.  Militant actions  At the beginning of the 20th century, the suffragette movement, frustrated by a failure to achieve equal voting rights for women, began adopting increasingly militant tactics. In particular, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), led by the charismatic Emmeline Pankhurst, frequently endorsed the use of property destruction to bring attention to the issue of women's suffrage. Richardson was a devoted supporter of Pankhurst and a member of the WSPU. Richardson joined Helen Craggs at the Women's Press shop and told her of the abuse from men (obsence remarks) and customers tearing up materials. Richardson claimed to be at the Epsom races on Derby Day, 4 June 1913, when Emily Davison jumped in front of the King's horse. Emily Davison died in Epsom Cottage Hospital; Mary Richardson was reportedly chased and beaten by an angry mob but was given refuge in Epsom Downs station by a railway porter.Hastings Press Google Books She committed a number of acts of arson, smashed windows at the Home Office and bombed a railway station.

It was produced and distributed by First National Pictures. It was the first color film to feature a widescreen sequence, using a process called Vitascope, the trademark name for Warner Bros.' widescreen process. The film, based on the 1925 Broadway musical of the same name, was nominated for an Academy Award for Sound Recording (George Groves). It is part of the tradition of operetta films, popular at the time. Plot Lantern slide for the film. Aniuta (Bernice Claire), known as The Flame, is a peasant girl who incites the people against the Czarist regime and the aristocracy through singing. Prince Volodya (Alexander Gray) is the leader of a group of Cossack troops who falls in love with the girl, even though she is part of a revolution that is opposed to his social class. Konstantin (Noah Beery) is a revolutionary who also falls in love with Aniuta, much to the anger of his lover, Natasha (Alice Gentle). The revolutionaries succeed in overthrowing the regime, leaving the Prince and his aristocratic class in peril for their lives and fortunes. Konstantin becomes the new leader and his brutal treatment of the people make many regret having supported the revolution in the first place. After he attempts to seduce her, Aniuta flees to a village in her native Poland. The Prince, fleeing from the new regime, happens to arrive at the same village. When he meets the girl again he decides to stay. They put their political differences aside and become romantically involved. Hearing from his spies that the Prince is at a Polish village, Konstantin immediately goes there and arrests him, announcing that he attends to execute him. Aniuta desperately attempts to free the Prince by agreeing to have sex with Konstantin. The Prince is released from prison through this ruse, but when is it discovered that she had no intention of keeping her side of the bargain, she is thrown into jail. The Prince disguises himself and attempts to free the girl, but he is discovered and imprisoned again. Before they can be executed, Natasha, revealing the real reason behind Konstantin's execution order, tells the troops to release both the Prince and Aniuta. Konstantin is arrested by the troops soon after as a traitor to the revolution, and is executed, leaving the Prince and the girl free to pursue their romance.

Based on the success of this song, Warner Bros. subsequently cast Beery in a number of musical films, most notably in Golden Dawn (1930).

It is about south-southwest of Montrose. History The earliest structure on the site was built for King William the Lion in the late twelfth century to repel Viking invasions to Lunan Bay. Evidence shows, however, that William took up residence there on several occasions whilst on hunting expeditions. In 1194, William conferred the castle, and land surrounding the village of Inverkeilor, east of the castle, to Walter de Berkeley, the Great Chamberlain. On his death, his lands of Inverkeilor, with the castle, passed to Ingram de Balliol who had married the heiress of Walter.Duchess of Cleveland, The Battle Abbey Roll with some account of the Norman Lineages, v.1, p. 253. He rebuilt the castle and the property remained in that family for two generations. When his grandson, Ingram, who flourished between 1280-84, died childless about 1305 the property passed to the son of Constance de Baliol, Henry de Fishburn. The property was forfeit during the reallocation by Robert the Bruce who in 1328 gave the castle to the Earl of Ross. The castle is referred to as rubeum castrum (Latin for Red Castle) in deeds of 1286, referring to its burnished red sandstone, typical of this area. In 1579, James, son of Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray, married Lady Elizabeth Beaton, who owned the castle, and fell in love with her daughter. After Lady Beaton threw him out, Gray (with his brother Andrew of Dunninald) laid siege to the castle for two years, ultimately burning the inhabitants out. James VI ordered John Erskine of Dun and his son Robert to bring siege engines and eject Gray, with the help of the townspeople of Dundee. Erskine was asked to make an inventory of the goods in the castle and give safe conduct for Elizabeth Beaton's son, the poet John Stewart of Baldynneis to the king's presence.HMC 5th Report: Erskine (London, 1876), pp. 636, 640. In 1590 it was reported that 12,000 gold crowns had been landed in the creek near the castle to aid the Catholic cause in Scotland.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 430. The castle slipped into decline, and, although it remained partially roofed until 1770, it was never again a residence of nobility. Its last inhabitant was the minister of Inverkeilor, one James Rait. Ruins of the keep Description Red Castle stands on high ground overlooking Lunan Bay, on the North Sea coast. Immediately to the north of Red Castle is the mouth of the Lunan Water, with the hamlet of Lunan beyond. Only a part of the fifteenth century rectangular tower, and the thick east curtain wall remain. The tower in particular is in precipitous condition, being perched on the edge of the hill above Lunan Bay, and was described as being \\"in imminent danger of collapse\\" in 1999. The castle is clearly visible from the A92 road and the Edinburgh to Aberdeen line. The remains are those of the 15th-century keep, and the surrounding wall, or enceinte, which may date from the 13th century. A midden below the castle is continually eroding, yielding a number of artefacts now in the Montrose Museum. The castle is protected as scheduled monument.

He is the co-founder of The Icarus Project, an international radical community support network and media project, which is attempting to redefine the language and culture of mental health and illness. He founded the Bay Area Seed Interchange Library (BASIL).A Seed Library for Heirloom Plants Thrives in the Hudson Valley He divides his time between the Bay Area and New York City.  Early life  DuBrul was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the son of Anita Altman, the founder and deputy director of the ReelAbilities: NY Disabilities Film Festival. His father, Paul DuBrul, was a journalist and speechwriter who died the night before DuBrul's Bar Mitzvah. In an interview with the Village Voice, DuBrul described his childhood: \\"I was raised by democratic socialists who believed in electoral politics‚Ä¶but my political education happened amidst the Tompkins Square riots of the late '80s.‚ÄùPortrait of a Protest New York - Village Voice, 18 April 2000 In his teens, DuBrul found community among punks and anarchist squatters on the Lower East Side.  Early Education  After attending Hunter College Elementary School and Bronx High School of Science, DuBrul graduated from St. Ann‚Äôs School in Brooklyn. He attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon for a year but dropped out after having a psychotic break. In a 2002 article for the San Francisco Bay Guardian, DuBrul wrote: \\"I was 18 years old the first time they locked me up in a psych ward. The police found me walking on the subway tracks in New York City, and I was convinced the world was about to end and I was being broadcast live on prime-time TV on all the channels.‚Äù He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.‚ÄòMad Pride‚Äô Fights a Stigma  Musical career and writing  After dropping out of Reed, DuBrul played in the classic ska-punk band Choking Victim. In 1995, he co-organized a traveling punk circus, which he then wrote about in his first book Carnival of Chaos: On the Road With the Nomadic Festival, published by Autonomedia. For eight years, DuBrul wrote a quarterly column for the punk zine Slug and Lettuce. DuBrul has written and lectured about the relationships between punk, activist culture, racial identity, oppression, and privilege. His memoir Maps to the Other Side was released in 2013 and focuses on DuBrul's navigation of the psychiatric system and creative mental health advocacy. In recent years, his writing has focused on drawing links between punk rock, Judaism, and the power and complexities of spiritual community.  Activism and travels  In his early twenties, DuBrul traveled to Mexico and Central America and worked with the Zapatista Uprising in Chiapas. Awakened by his experiences in Mexico, he went on to participate in a diverse number of activist projects: from the Earth First! road blockades of the Pacific Northwest, to the fight to save the community gardens in New York City, to the protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle in November 1999. Often DuBrul would travel between activist projects on freight trains. The details of his wanderings across the country and through Mexico often ended up in zines which, according to the Village Voice, \\"combine[d] adventure-travel tales with thoughtful observations about the global economy.‚Äù DuBrul was the inspiration for singer Jolie Holland's song Sascha.\\"Crazy for Love: Jolie Holland learns that madness is a matter of perspective.By Chris Parker Published: October 11, 2006 \\"  Bay Area Seed Interchange Library  While interning at a CSA farm in British Columbia, DuBrul became fascinated by permaculture and the genetic relationships that arose when domestic crops intermingled with their wild relatives. Having been raised in Manhattan, his urban sensibilities gave him a unique way of thinking about agriculture and the need to revitalize older methods of community seed production. In 2000, he founded the first urban seed lending library: the Bay Area Seed Interchange Library, or BASIL. In an interview with the New York Times, DuBrul said: ‚ÄúAn urban seed library is about the relationship between biological and cultural diversity, and people having a direct connection to the seeds that are growing their foods.‚Äù BASIL has become a model for other seed libraries across the country, including the Hudson Valley Seed Library, the first seed library in a public library in the country. According to Michael Carolan, there are currently more than 660 seed libraries in 48 states in the US. The author Ruth Ozeki drew from DuBrul‚Äôs vision of seed activism for her New York Times Notable Book All Over Creation.Ruth Ozeki - Description of \\"All Over Creation\\"  The Icarus Project  In 2002, DuBrul wrote \\"Bipolar World\\", an article published in the San Francisco Bay Guardian, relating to his personal experiences being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Among the dozens of e-mails and other correspondence that he received after this publication was a letter from Jacks Ashley McNamara, an artist and writer who identified strongly with his experiences. DuBrul and McNamara corresponded for a few weeks before finally meeting in person and deciding to start a website where people who identified with bipolar and other 'mental illness' could find real community and contribute to it. The Icarus Project was born. DuBrul has been quoted as claiming he has \\"superpowers\\" due to his allegedly heightened sensitivity to his surroundings.Columbia News Service, Nov 1, 2005 - A new movement views bipolar disorder as a dangerous gift - By Jennifer Itzenson The Icarus Project is an online, international radical community support network and media project with over 14,000 participants. It has numerous local groups across North America and has released a number of publications. Navigating the Space Between Brilliance and Madness; A Reader and Roadmap of Bipolar Worlds was published by the Icarus Project in March 2004 and is currently in its 10th printing.  Public Mental System and the Mad Underground  After 12 years, DuBrul stepped back from his work with the Icarus Project to train as a clinician in the public mental health system. He attended social work school at Silberman School of Social Work, which included a year long internship (in dialogic practice) with the Parachute Project, and he was then hired by the Center for Practice Innovations at the New York State Psychiatric Institute as a trainer of Peer Specialists in First Episode Psychosis programs. While at the Institute, he was the first author for the Peer Specialist manual for OnTrackNY. During this period, DuBrul also helped to develop the Institute for the Development of Human Arts, a training institute for mental health workers. This institute offers training to clinicians and peer workers in order to think about their personal relationship to mental health and illness. It is also building a network of mentorship to positively transform the mental health system. Dubrul is quoted as saying that ‚Äúhis interests lie at the intersection of the public mental health system and the Mad Underground.‚Äù  Tours and teaching  Shortly after the Icarus launched, DuBrul embarked on a tour of North America, facilitating workshops and leading discussions on alternative conceptions of mental illness and wellness. After the tour, Dubrul worked with McNamara and other Icarus members to create a guide for creating community support around madness and mental health. This was published under the title \\"Friends Make the Best Medicine.\\" In 2007, DuBrul and a group of fellow Icarus Project members organized the \\"Mad Gifts Tour.\\" As part of this tour, the group visited Virginia Tech soon after the April 16th massacre of 32 students, which stirred controversy about mental health on college campuses. DuBrul toured Europe in 2011, facilitating workshops and giving talks about radical mental health support. During the summers of 2010 and 2012, he co- taught month long seminars at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. In the Spring of 2013, in conjunction with the release of his book, Maps to the Other Side, DuBrul, along with Icarus Project co-founder Ashley Jacks McNamara, toured the United States giving readings, and conducting workshops and discussions on mental health.

It gets its name from the parish church of St Giles in the Fields. The combined parishes of St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury (which was carved out of the former) were administered jointly for many centuries; leading to the conflation of the two, with much or all of St Giles usually taken to be a part of Bloomsbury. Points of interest include the church of St Giles in the Fields, the Phoenix Garden and St Giles Circus. History There has been a church at St Giles since Saxon times, located beside a major highway.London: A Biography (2000) Ackroyd, Peter Chatto and Windus p131-140 The hospital of St Giles, recorded c. 1120 as Hospitali Sancti Egidii extra Londonium was founded, together with a monastery and a chapel, by Queen Matilda, wife of Henry I. St Giles (c. 650 ‚Äì c. 710) was the patron saint of lepers and the hospital was home to a leper colony, the site chosen for its surrounding fields and marshes separating contagion from nearby London. Peter Ackroyd argues that the character of vagrancy has never left the area. A village accreted to cater to the brethren and patients. The crossroads which is now St Giles Circus, where Oxford Street, Charing Cross Road, Tottenham Court Road and New Oxford St meet, was the site of a gallows until the fifteenth century. The Lollard leader Sir John Oldcastle was hanged, and he and his gallows were burnt there. Grape Street, in the heart of the St Giles district, runs beside the site of the hospital's vineyard. The south-west of the parish of St Pancras, showing boundary with Giles in the Fields, 1804: Tottenham Court Road to the west and Francis street (now Torrington Place) to the north The monastery was dissolved during the Reformation and a parish church created from the chapel. The hospital continued to care for lepers until the mid-sixteenth century, when the disease abated and the hospital instead began to care for indigents.St Giles in the Fields: HistoryBritish History Online 'Religious Houses: Hospitals', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1: Physique, Archaeology, Domesday, Ecclesiastical Organization, The Jews, Religious Houses, Education of Working Classes to 1870, Private Education from Sixteenth Century (1969), pp. 204‚Äì212. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22122. Date accessed: 3 January 2008. The parish was known as St Giles in the Fields and it is recorded in 1563 as Seynt Gyles in the Field. The first post-Catholic parish church was built in 1631 and from the mid-seventeenth century church wardens note \\"a great influx of poor people into this parish\\". The cellars in particular were already recorded as horrific places in which whole families resided, \\"damp and unwholesome\\" as the village was built on marshland. The Parliamentary Act of 1606 had condemned the area as \\"deepe foul and dangerous\\" . Vagrants expelled from the city settled in the St Giles district known for the generous charitable relief of the parish. Irish and French refugees were drawn to the area as well as \\"St Giles blackbirds\\", black servants reduced to begging. The 1665 Great Plague started in St Giles and the first victims were buried in the St Giles churchyard. By September 1665, 8,000 people were dying a week in London. By the end of the plague year there were 3,216 listed plague deaths in St Giles parish, which had fewer than 2,000 households.Museum of London After the Restoration, the area was populated by Huguenot refugees who had fled persecution and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans, particularly in weaving and the silk trade. Thornbury, Walter (1878) \\"Old and New London: Volume 3\\" pp. 197‚Äì218. \\" XXVI. St Giles in the Fields\\" The southern area of the parish, around present day Shaftesbury Avenue, was a wasteland named Cock and Pye Fields. Houses were not built there until 1666, after the Great Fire, and not fully developed until 1693, becoming known as Seven Dials. Thomas Neale built much of the area, giving his name to Neal Street and Neal's Yard. St Giles and Seven Dials became known for their astrologers and alchemists, an association which lasts to this day. The village of St Giles stood on the main road from Holborn to Tyburn, a place of local execution. Convicted criminals were often allowed, in tradition, to stop at St Giles en route to Tyburn for a final drink - a \\"St Giles Bowl\\" - before hanging. =The rookery= As London grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, so did the parish's population, rising to 30,000 by 1831. Later, a large percentage were Irish, having emigrated because of the Great Famine (Ireland) during 1845 and 1849. The rookery stood between the church and Great Russell Street, and Seven Dials near where Centre Point stands today, now home to the Centrepoint homeless charity.Guardian article \\"London parish's descent from glamour to grime charted in exhibition\\" 16 May 2011 It was of one of the worst slums within Britain, a site of overcrowding and squalor, a semi-derelict warren. From Georgian affluence in the 18th century, the area declined rapidly, as houses were divided up, many families sharing a single room. Irish Catholic immigrants seeking to escape desperate poverty took up residence and the slum was nicknamed \\"Little Ireland\\" or \\"The Holy Land\\". The expression \\"a St Giles cellar\\" passed into common parlance, describing the worst conditions of poverty. Open sewers often ran through rooms and cesspits were left untended. Residents complained to the Times in 1849: \\"We live in muck and filth. We aint got no priviz, no dust bins, no drains, no water-splies, and no drain or suer in the hole place.\\"[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/bleakhouse/carter.html Letter to The Times complaining of their living conditions, written by residents of St Giles\\" 17 May 2011] The rookery was a maze of gin shops, prostitutes' hovels and secret alleyways that police had little hope of navigating. William Hogarth, Thomas Rowlandson, and Gustave Dor√©, among others, drew the area, as did novelists Henry Fielding and Charles Dickens. Romance novelists Elizabeth Hoyt and Erica Monroe wrote about it extensively in their Maiden Lane and Rookery Rogues series, respectively. Peter Ackroyd writes \\"The Rookeries embodied the worst living conditions in all of London's history; this was the lowest point which human beings could reach\\". Reformer Henry Mayhew described the slum in 1860 in A Visit to the Rookery of St Giles and its Neighbourhood: As the population grew, so did their dead, the area a home to cholera and consumption. Eventually there was no room in their graveyard, so during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many were buried in the cemeteries surrounding St Pancras. From the 1830s to the 1870s plans were developed to demolish the slum as part of London wide clearances for improved transport routes, sanitation and the expansion of the railways. New Oxford Street was driven through the area to join the areas of Oxford Street and Holborn. The Rookery dwellers were not re-housed by the authorities. 5000 were evicted and many just moved into nearby slums, such as Devil's Acre and Church Lane making those more overcrowded still. The unchanging character of the area, failing investment schemes and inability to sell new properties ensured that plans for wholesale clearance were stymied until the end of the century.Victorian London (2005) Picard, Liza.

Some sources indicate that the parish was in place before 1222https://www.british- history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol5/pt2/pp1-2 while others suggest 1547. From 1597 onwards, English parishes were obliged to take on a civil as well as ecclesiastical role, starting with the relief of the poor. The parish formed part of the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. The parish of St George Bloomsbury was split off in 1731, but the parishes were combined for civil purposes in 1774 and used for the administration of the Poor Law after the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. George Buchanan was appointed Health Officer for the parish around 1856. Upon the creation of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 the combined parishes became the St Giles District and were transferred to the County of London in 1889. The St Giles ecclesiastical parish was an elongated \\"L\\" shape, stretching from Torrington Place in the north to Shelton Street in the south and then east to include Lincoln's Inn Fields. For registration, and therefore census reporting, the civil parish was divided in North and South districts, with Monmouth Street broadly forming the division. The length of St Giles High Street is identical to the width of the parish at that point. The ecclesiastical parish of St George Bloomsbury was located to the northeast. In 1881 the population of St Giles North was 13,837http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data;_cube=N_TOT_POP&u;_id=10565133&c;_id=&add;=N and St Giles South was 14,864.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data;_cube=N_TOT_POP&u;_id=10564451&c;_id=&add;=N The local government of London was reorganised in 1900 and St Giles became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn.

Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty. The picture shows the Huguenot refugees who arrived in the 1680s and established themselves in the silk trade; Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group on the other side of the road; the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the only thing the two sides have in common. The older members of the congregation wear traditional dress, while the younger members wear the fashions of the day. The children are dressed up as adults: the boy in the foreground struts around in his finery while the boy with his back to the viewer has his hair in a net, bagged up in the \\"French\\" style.Cooke and Davenport. Vol. 1 Noon (1821). The Works of William Hogarth. London: J.Sharpe. At the far right, a black man, probably a freed slave, fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her pie-dish \\"tottering like her virtue\\". In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin.Uglow, Jenny (1997). Hogarth: a life and a world. Faber and Faber. p. 83 . =\\"Gin Lane\\"= First stage of cruelty (Plate I) Hogarth etching (1751) Set in St Giles, \\"Gin Lane\\" depicts the squalor and despair of a community raised on gin. The only businesses that flourish are those which serve the gin industry: gin sellers; distillers; the pawnbroker where the avaricious Mr. Gripe greedily takes the vital possessions (the carpenter offers his saw and the housewife her cooking utensils) of the alcoholic residents of the street in return for a few pennies to feed their habit; and the undertaker, for whom Hogarth implies at least a handful of new customers from this scene alone. Most shockingly, the focus of the picture is a woman in the foreground, who, addled by gin and driven to prostitution by her habit ‚Äîas evidenced by the syphilitic sores on her legs‚Äî lets her baby slip unheeded from her arms and plunge to its death in the stairwell of the gin cellar below. Half-naked, she has no concern for anything other than a pinch of snuff. This mother was not such an exaggeration as she might appear: in 1734, Judith Dufour reclaimed her two-year-old child from the workhouse where it had been given a new set of clothes; she then strangled it and left the infant's body in a ditch so that she could sell the clothes (for 1s. 4d.) to buy gin.George p. 41 In another case, an elderly woman, Mary Estwick, let a toddler burn to death while she slept in a gin-induced stupor.Warner, Jessica (2002). Craze: Gin and Debauchery in an Age of Reason. Thunder's Mouth Press. . p. 69 Other images of despair and madness fill the scene: a lunatic cavorts in the street beating himself over the head with a pair of bellows while holding a baby impaled on a spike‚Äîthe dead child's frantic mother rushes from the house screaming in horror; a barber has taken his own life in the dilapidated attic of his barber-shop, ruined because nobody can afford a haircut or shave; on the steps, below the woman who has let her baby fall, a skeletal pamphlet-seller rests, perhaps dead of starvation, as the unsold moralising pamphlet on the evils of gin-drinking, The Downfall of Mrs Gin, slips from his basket.Clerk, Thomas (1812). The Works of William Hogarth. 2. London: Scholey.p29 =\\"First stage of cruelty\\"= Set in St Giles, the etching shows a boy, Nero, is being assisted by other boys torturing a dog by inserting an arrow into its rectum. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. Modern governance St Giles is split between the electoral wards of Bloomsbury and Holborn and Covent Garden in the London Borough of Camden. With some sections of Holborn and Bloomsbury it forms part of the Midtown business improvement district. It is within the Holborn and St Pancras Parliament constituency and the Barnet and Camden London Assembly constituency. Tottenham Court Road tube station St Giles Crossrail reconstruction September 2010 The Central London Railway (CLR) opened Tottenham Court Tube Station, between the Church of St Giles in the Fields and St Giles Circus on 30 July 1900.Clive's Underground Line Guides - Central Line, Dates Tottenham Court Road underwent improvements in the early 1930s to replace lifts with escalators. The station had four entrances to the sub- surface ticket hall from the north-east, south-west and north-west corners of St Giles Circus and from a subway beneath the Centrepoint building which starts on Andrew Borde Street. The entrances were frequently congested leading to occasions during peak periods of the day when they were briefly closed to prevent overcrowding in the station. In 2009, Transport for London began a major reconstruction of large parts of the station. Much of the St Giles area alongside St Giles High Street has been cleared to make way for the new development including Crossrail expansion.Crossrail - Proposal for eastern ticket hall The Astoria theatre on Charing Cross Road has been demolished and the original Central line entrances will also go.

Its main goal is the management of the information overload and increment of the semantic signal-to-noise ratio. To do this the user's profile is compared to some reference characteristics. These characteristics may originate from the information item (the content-based approach) or the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach). Whereas in information transmission signal processing filters are used against syntax-disrupting noise on the bit-level, the methods employed in information filtering act on the semantic level. The range of machine methods employed builds on the same principles as those for information extraction. A notable application can be found in the field of email spam filters. Thus, it is not only the information explosion that necessitates some form of filters, but also inadvertently or maliciously introduced pseudo-information. On the presentation level, information filtering takes the form of user-preferences-based newsfeeds, etc. Recommender systems and content discovery platforms are active information filtering systems that attempt to present to the user information items (film, television, music, books, news, web pages) the user is interested in. These systems add information items to the information flowing towards the user, as opposed to removing information items from the information flow towards the user. Recommender systems typically use collaborative filtering approaches or a combination of the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches, although content-based recommender systems do exist.  History  Before the advent of the Internet, there are already several methods of filtering information; for instance, governments may control and restrict the flow of information in a given country by means of formal or informal censorship. On the other hand, we are going to talk about information filters if we refer to newspaper editors and journalists when they provide a service that selects the most valuable information for their clients, readers of books, magazines, newspapers, radio listeners and viewers TV. This filtering operation is also present in schools and universities where there is a selection of information to provide assistance based on academic criteria to customers of this service, the students. With the advent of the Internet it is possible that anyone can publish anything he wishes at a low-cost. In this way, it increases considerably the less useful information and consequently the quality information is disseminated. With this problem, it began to devise new filtering with which we can get the information required for each specific topic to easily and efficiently.  Operation  A filtering system of this style consists of several tools that help people find the most valuable information, so the limited time you can dedicate to read / listen / view, is correctly directed to the most interesting and valuable documents. These filters are also used to organize and structure information in a correct and understandable way, in addition to group messages on the mail addressed. These filters are essential in the results obtained of the search engines on the Internet. The functions of filtering improves every day to get downloading Web documents and more efficient messages. = Criterion = One of the criteria used in this step is whether the knowledge is harmful or not, whether knowledge allows a better understanding with or without the concept. In this case the task of information filtering to reduce or eliminate the harmful information with knowledge. = Learning System= A system of learning content consists, in general rules, mainly of three basic stages: # First, a system that provides solutions to a defined set of tasks. # Subsequently, it undergoes assessment criteria which will measure the performance of the previous stage in relation to solutions of problems. # Acquisition module which its output obtained knowledge that are used in the system solver of the first stage.  Future  Currently the problem is not finding the best way to filter information, but the way that these systems require to learn independently the information needs of users. Not only because they automate the process of filtering but also the construction and adaptation of the filter. Some branches based on it, such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining, are the base for developing information filters that appear and adapt in base to experience. To allow the learning process can be carried out, part of the information has to be pre-filtered, it means there are positive and negative examples which we named training data, which can be generated by experts or, via feedback through ordinary users. = Error = As data is entered, the system includes new rules; if we consider that this data can generalize the training data information, then we have to evaluate the system development and measure the system's ability to correctly predict the categories of new information. This step is simplified by separating the training data in a new series called \\"test data\\" that we will use to measure the error rate. As a general rule it is important to distinguish between types of errors (false positives and false negatives). For example, in the case on an aggregator of content for children, it doesn't have the same gravity to allow the passage of information not suitable for them, that shows violence or pornography, than the mistake to discard some appropriated information. To improve the system to lower error rates and have these systems with learning capabilities similar to humans we require development of systems that simulate human cognitive abilities, such as natural language understanding, capturing meaning Common and other forms of advanced processing to achieve the semantics of information.  Fields of use  Nowadays, there are numerous techniques to develop information filters, some of these reach error rates lower than 10% in various experiments. Among these techniques there are decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian networks, linear discriminants, logistic regression, etc.. At present, these techniques are used in different applications, not only in the web context, but in thematic issues as varied as voice recognition, classification of telescopic astronomy or evaluation of financial risk.

It was originally patented by ammunition designer Tom Burczynski. Hydra-Shok was released in 1988 after the FBI requested a bullet with better terminal ballistics than traditional cup and core projectiles. Design Hydra-Shok ammunition features a unique, patented center-post design and notched jacket with a non-bonded lead core. Together they are meant to provide more reliable expansion and deeper penetration than the other projectiles used at that time. Center post designed bullets like Hydra-Shok have more predictable results and therefore offer some advantage as a projectile. The manufacturer says that the scored jacket and center post design provide a \\"programmed\\" expansion. There has been much debate regarding the bullet's unreliable expansion when fired through clothing or media other than ballistic gelatin, in which the bullet typically displays very rapid expansion resulting in a larger but more shallow wound channel than would be typical from most other bullet configurations in the same caliber and of similar weight.

He was born and grew up near Beaumont, Texas. In 1892 he converted a grist mill into the Beaumont Rice Mill, the first commercially successful rice mill in the state of Texas. He also established an irrigation company (later absorbed by the Lower Neches Valley Authority) to create an irrigation system to support rice agriculture. As a result of his work, the cultivation of rice expanded from 1500 acres locally in 1892 to 400,000 acres in 23 Texas counties by the time of Broussard's death. His leadership and landholdings resulted in rice being cultivated in peak years on some 40,000 acres in the local area. As the mill processed rice, it helped rice become an important commodity crop of the early residents of Beaumont. Broussard also raised cattle on his property, and harvesting lumber was important in the region. Early life and education Joseph Eloi Broussard was born on December 16, 1866 to Eloi and Mary Azema (H√©bert) Broussard in Beaumont, Texas, a farming and lumber area. His maternal grandfather was of French Creole descent and had migrated to Texas from Louisiana. His father's family was also of French ancestry, and he was raised as Roman Catholic. After his father died when Joseph was young, his mother remarried to Lovan Hamshire. They lived on his ranch near present-day Hamshire, Texas. Young Joseph studied for three years at an academy in Galveston, then began working with cattle and as a postal rider in Jefferson County, Texas. Career In 1885 Broussard was named at the age of 19 as the first postmaster of a local post office. He named it La Belle for his fianc√©e, Mary Belle Bordages. Broussard and Mary Belle Bordages married in 1889 and had nine children together. Her father Phillip Bordages (c. 1840-1891) was born in France and immigrated to New Orleans at the age of 18. He settled in Jefferson County, Texas, where he became a farmer and merchant. He married Ellen Elliott (1846-1889) and they had six children together. The Bordages parents are buried in the Broussard Cemetery southwest of Beaumont.Bordages Family Photographs, Tyrrell Historical Library Digital Collections A few years later Broussard bought a one-third interest in a gristmill in Beaumont. In 1891 he founded the Beaumont Irrigation Company with a rice irrigation and canal system, the first in the state, to support rice culture in the area.\\"Rice Culture\\", Texas Handbook Online In 1892 he converted his mill to a rice mill, the first commercially successful one in the state of Texas. At that time, farmers in the county had 1500 acres in rice. Broussard was instrumental in establishing the rice industry and this product as a commodity crop in Texas. Rice cultivation expanded. By 1903, Texas farmers \\"planted 234,000 acres of rice compared to Louisiana's 376,000 acres. The two states then produced 99 percent of the total rice crop, with production having virtually ceased in South Carolina and Georgia.\\" In peak years under Broussard's management, local farms had 40,000 acres in rice. The irrigation company became institutionalized in 1933 when established by the state legislature as the Lower Neches Valley Authority. Broussard also encouraged rice farmers to organize, serving as president of the Rice Millers' and Dealers' Association (the forerunner of the current Rice Millers' Association of America), from 1907 to 1918. During the early years, he traveled with a team to Europe to market his area's rice. By the time of Broussard's death in 1956, rice was being cultivated on 400,000 acres in 23 counties in Texas. By the 1980s, his grandson was running the rice mill.

It was also used to provide horizontal thrust in the Short SC 1. Design and development The RB108 was the first direct-lift turbojet produced by Rolls- Royce. It originated from a VTOL concept in which Alan A. Griffith proposed using a small number of specialised lift engines in a VTOL aircraft, separate from the engines which provided forward propulsion. Its power output (thrust) was not high enough for use as a practical engine in a production aircraftRolls-Royce From The wings 1925-1971 Military Aviation, R.W.Harker, Oxford Illustrated Press Ltd., , p.121 and was used only for research into VTOL. It was constructed from conventional materials. The next engine, the RB162, would have a compressor built mainly from glass-fibre composite and have a higher T/W ratio. The RB108 bearings and oil system were designed to operate with an engine attitude envelope which covered engine and aircraft tilting while transitioning between hovering and forward flight. When a fifth engine was installed in the SC.1 to provide forward thrust it had to be mounted at about 45 degrees to remain within the envelope. The exhaust was directed horizontally with a curved jetpipe. Applications The RB.108 was used in the Short SC.1, which used four for lift with an additional one mounted at an angle at the rear for propulsion, and the Mirage Balzac, which used eight vertically mounted RB.108s for lift. The Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) SG 1262 used five RB.108s, three mounted in tandem on the centreline, with one RB.108 either side. The RB.108 was also the intended powerplant for several other VTOL aircraft designs, including one by Dornier. A similar lift jet was designed by Bristol Siddeley, the BS.59, with a thrust of 8,000 lb the engine was intended for the projected Focke-Wulf Fw 260.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201015.html Specifications (RB.108) See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= *Gunston, Bill.

It was introduced to New Zealand by the Polynesian ancestors of the MƒÅori during their migration from East Polynesia in the 13th century AD. According to MƒÅori tradition, the demigod MƒÅui transformed his brother-in-law Irawaru into the first dog.  Description  Kurƒ´ were bushy-tailed, with short legs and powerful shoulders. Their coat colour ranged from yellowish brown to black, white, or spotted. Like other Polynesian dog breeds, they howled instead of barked ‚Äì the MƒÅori word for the howl was auau.  Use  Kurƒ´ were a source of food for MƒÅori, and considered a delicacy. British explorer James Cook sampled kurƒ´ on his 1769 voyage and declared that it was almost as tasty as lamb. Kurƒ´ were also used to hunt birds. In addition, MƒÅori used their skins and fur to make dog-skin cloaks (kahu kurƒ´), belts, weapon decorations and poi.  Extinction  Kurƒ´ were seen widely across New Zealand during Cook's first voyage in 1769. The kurƒ´ became extinct in New Zealand in the 1860s, following the arrival of European settlers; the breed was unable to survive interbreeding with European dogs.

He is best known for his time as Headmaster at Guildford Grammar School and later for the building of the Chapel of SS. Mary and George.Australian Dictionary of Biography listing for Henn, Percy Umfreville (accessed 4 March 2007)AustLit Agent Listing for Percy Henn (accessed 4 March 2007) Henn gained his BA in 1887 and MA in 1890 from Worcester College at Oxford University. He taught at various schools until 1900, when he became a missionary in Western Australia in country towns. In Western Australia Henn married Jean Elliott and had four children. After further religious work in regional WA, he moved to Guildford, Western Australia and became a leading force behind Guildford Grammar School's Guildford Grammar School Chapel and preparatory school. He died in 1955 at age 90.  Early years  Henn was born in Manchester, England, as the tenth child of Rev. John Henn and his wife Catherine, n√©e Holcroft. His older brother, Sydney Henn, became a member of parliament. Henn was educated at Christ's Hospital, London, as a bluecoat boy, and then at Worcester College, Oxford, on a scholarship. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1887, proceeding to a Master of Arts three years later.  Early career  Henn decided, before taking on a spiritual career, that he would become a teacher. He began his career as an assistant master at Hurstpierpoint College, West Sussex (one of the Woodard Schools, a series of eleven schools founded by Nathaniel Woodard). There, he became interested in education through religion, and became an ordained priest in 1891. He then became Chaplain at Hurstpierpoint in 1892. Henn became recognised as a teacher when he became a founding headmaster at Worksop College in Nottinghamshire; however he resigned in 1899 amidst differences with a new superior who disagreed with Henn's philosophy of a school grounds with beautiful buildings dominated by a chapel.Register of Heritage Places ‚Äì Assessment Documentation ‚Äì Guildford Grammar School Chapel (accessed 10 December 2007)  Looking abroad  In January 1900, Henn arrived as a missionary in Perth, Western Australia. After a short spell in Kalgoorlie, he moved to Geraldton as rector (parish priest). On 3 April 1902, in Geraldton, Henn married Jean Elliott. They eventually had four children together, one of whom, Guy Gavin Henn, became a member of parliament. Henn became a rector in Northam for three years (1902‚Äì1905), signifying the end of his missionary term. He returned to England and became organising secretary in the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the dioceses of Canterbury and Rochester.Revd. John Henn, Percy Henn's father  Return to Western Australia  =A Chapel for Guildford= In 1910, Henn returned to Perth to take up the position of Headmaster of Guildford Grammar School. His task was to oversee the first attempt by the Church of England at secondary education since 1873. His first thought for the new school was the provision of a chapel. To him, a Church school without a chapel was \\"like the play of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.\\" Henn immediately sent out a circular entitled \\"A Church of England Secondary School for Western Australia.\\" This circular fell into the hands of one Cecil H. Oliverson, whom Henn eventually persuaded to pay the full cost of the Chapel, the Chapel of SS. Mary and George. =Relations with Christ Church Grammar School= In 1918, Guildford Grammar School and Christ Church Grammar School were placed under the same ruling council. Henn became a member immediately; however, Christ Church did not gain representation until 1920. In 1918, Henn suggested that Christ Church Grammar School's oval be widened and made a first-class playing field. Christ Church Grammar School Founder's Day Article (accessed 17 March 2007) = Guildford Preparatory School = In 1912, a Cecil Priestley was temporarily employed by Henn as a member of the Guildford Grammar School staff. It seems today that he conceived the idea of a Guildford Preparatory School. Henn was enthusiastic about this, however the Guildford Preparatory School did not integrate with the main Guildford Grammar School until 1921, when it became Guildford Grammar Preparatory School, and Priestley resigned from his position as the Head of the Prep School around this time.Henn, Wilfrid E.

Moriarty played amateur football early in his career for Victoria Parks, until 1915. Frank Barry convinced Moriarty to come to the South Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian Football League. Moriarty played four reserves games at the end of the 1915 season, before the league went into recess for three years due to World War I. He played in the Patriotic League in 1917 and 1918. The SAFL returned from recess in 1919, and Moriarty made his league debut for South Adelaide, immediately becoming one of the league's star players at centre half-back. In each of his first three seasons - 1919, 1920 and 1921 - Moriarty won the Magarey Medal as the fairest and most brilliant player in the league. He remains the only player to have won the Magarey Medal in three consecutive seasons. He initially won all three Magarey Medals outright, although the 1920 and 1921 medals are now recorded as ties, with several other players later receiving retrospective medals for those seasons. Moriarty was selected in the South Australian team in interstate matches in 1919, and represented the state regularly throughout his career. He won the inaugural South Adelaide Football Club best and fairest in 1923, and was the club captain in 1925. Moriarty retired from league football at the age of 30, after the 1925 season. His career spanned 97 league games for South Adelaide, and 22 state games (played consecutively) for South Australia between 1919 and 1925. Moriarty's size (178 cm, 76 kg) was small compared with most of the other great centre half-backs in the history of the game. In his playing style, he is noted to have been an excellent two-way player. As a defender, he tightly marked his direct opponent, had a very high leap with which he could spoil the ball, and was credited with a strong ability to read and anticipate the play; in a self- assessment, Moriarty credited his ability to read the play as the most important contributor to his success as a player. As a rebounding player, his ability to rebound accurately to team-mates - rather than kick to contests or turnovers - is regarded as the key to why Moriarty was a dangerous player on attack as well as in defence. Moriarty's career has been widely honoured since his retirement. He has been inducted into four halls of fame: *Sport Australia Hall of Fame (inducted 1986) *Australian Football Hall of Fame (inaugural inductee, 1996) *South Australian Football Hall of Fame (inaugural inductee, 2002) *South Adelaide Football Club Hall of Fame He was named at centre half- back in the South Adelaide Football Club's Official Greatest Team. Sturt captain and Australian cricketer Vic Richardson has stated that Moriarty was the greatest footballer he had ever seen, and he is often described as the greatest South Australian footballer between the two World Wars. Following his football career, Moriarty was involved in horse racing, including as a journalist. His son, also named Dan, is also involved in horse racing. Moriarty died in 1982, aged 87.

The hymn tune to which it is usually sung is called Love Unknown by John Ireland (1879‚Äì1962). Ireland composed the melody over lunch one day at the suggestion of organist and fellow-composer Geoffrey Shaw.  History  Samuel Crossman was a Puritan minister who had taken part in the Savoy Conference but was ejected from the Church of England due to his opposition to the Act of Uniformity 1662. During his exile from the Church of England, he wrote \\"My Song Is Love Unknown\\" as a poem in 1664. It was first published in The Young Man‚Äôs Meditation and then became published as an Anglican hymn in 1684, after Crossman had rejoined the Church of England in 1665 and two years after his death. The last verse of the hymn was written as an imitation of George Herbert's The Temple poem as a tribute by Crossman to Herbert. In the 21st century, the language of the hymn is sometimes updated by hymnal editors, a move which is often lamented by traditional hymnologists who feel that the newer language loses the original meaning and nuance. The most commonly used tune for \\"My Song Is Love Unknown\\" is called \\"Love Unknown\\". It was written by John Ireland in 1925 and reportedly was composed in 15 minutes on the back of a menu. Ireland's tune was credited with bringing the hymn out of obscurity which it had fallen into during Victorian times. Analysis The Reverend Percy Dearmer stated that \\"My Song Is Love Unknown\\" \\"... illustrates the fact that 17th-century Britain was free from the unwholesome treatment of the Passion which is shown, for instance, in the Spanish sculpture of that age\\". The fourth verse asked what Jesus had done to deserve the crucifixion with the ironic answer being that he had healed the sick. Lyrics The lyrics of the hymn are as follows: My song is love unknown, My Saviour‚Äôs love to me; Love to the loveless shown, That they might lovely be. O who am I, That for my sake My Lord should take Frail flesh and die? He came from His blest throne Salvation to bestow; But men made strange, and none The longed-for Christ would know: But O! my Friend, My Friend indeed, Who at my need His life did spend. Sometimes they strew His way, And His sweet praises sing; Resounding all the day Hosannas to their King: Then ‚ÄúCrucify!‚Äù is all their breath, And for His death they thirst and cry. Why, what hath my Lord done? What makes this rage and spite? He made the lame to run, He gave the blind their sight, Sweet injuries! Yet they at these Themselves displease, and ‚Äôgainst Him rise. They rise and needs will have My dear Lord made away; A murderer they save, The Prince of life they slay, Yet cheerful He to suffering goes, That He His foes from thence might free. In life no house, no home, My Lord on earth might have; In death no friendly tomb, But what a stranger gave. What may I say? Heav'n was his home; But mine the tomb Wherein he lay. Here might I stay and sing, No story so divine; Never was love, dear King! Never was grief like Thine. This is my Friend, in Whose sweet praise I all my days could gladly spend. Inspirations The British band Coldplay's song \\"A Message\\" on their 2005 album X&Y;, is lyrically and musically derived from the hymn.

Outline The main character, only referred to as 'the girl' (Patricia Healey) leaves London, goes north on a train full of football fans and takes a trip in a white double-decker bus around an unnamed city she is visiting, although it is clearly based on Manchester; Delaney was born and grew up in nearby Salford. The Mayor (Arthur Lowe), a local businessman, and the council's ceremonial macebearer (John Sharp) happen also to be taking the trip while they show the city to visiting foreigners. Locations include Albert Square and its landmark, the Town Hall and the nearby Central Library. The 'model estate' of high-rise flats was shot on the Kersal Flats estate, while the factory sequences were shot in Trafford Park, including the Metropolitan-Vickers works. It also featured scenes on Cheetham Hill Road and inside Cheetham College (now demolished). Both the exterior and interior shots of the school were taken in the former Pendleton High School for Girls ‚Äì now mainly demolished, but with the original Victorian building converted to a retirement home. Using local people, Anderson also staged parodies of paintings by Manet (Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe), Fragonard and Goya in Buile Hill Park in Salford.

The group was formed after the Dutch government nationalised the Dutch part of Fortis on October 3, 2008 to prevent the bank and insurer succumbing to the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. The insurance arm of Fortis has been split off as ASR Nederland. When the group was formed, the Dutch government had a 97.8% stake in Fortis Bank Netherlands Holding NV, a 100% stake in Fortis Insurance Netherlands NV, and a 33.8% stake in RFS Holdings BV. It said that the banks would be integrated and merged into one organisation under the name ABN AMRO Bank N.V. before an exit would occur. The merger was completed on 1 July 2010 and the Dutch government has said that the bank will remain under state ownership until at least 2011 after which it would consider a public listing on the stock market. Credit crisis In 2007, the RFS consortium (consisting of Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Banco Santander), acquired the Dutch bank ABN AMRO for approximately ‚Ç¨72 billion (or approximately ‚Ç¨39 per share). As part of the deal Fortis bank gained the Private Banking, Asset Management and the ABN AMROs Netherlands Business Unit for which it paid ‚Ç¨24 billion. It had planned to merge these businesses with its own operations in the Netherlands and expected the integration to be completed by late 2009. However the acquisition had depleted Fortis banks reserves and it got into serious trouble in 2008 as the credit crunch took hold. Prior to the financial problems, the European Union competition commissioner had ruled that for the acquisition to be approved, Fortis would need to sell part of the business it acquired from ABN AMRO. To do this Fortis split the group under the name NEWbank and planned to sell it to Deutsche Bank, however the sale was stopped by the Dutch government at the time of nationalization and the deal was renegotiated. In September 2008 Fortis announced that its share of ABN AMRO Bank was for sale again. However, no buyer could be found.Fortis confirms injection EUR11, 2 billion, would sell ABN Amro ING buys ABN Amro from Fortis' Trouw, September 29, 2008ING does not bid for ABN Amro Netherlands NRC, September 29, 2008 and therefore on October 4, 2008, the Dutch government announced that it would acquire all the Dutch operations of Fortis, including ABN AMRO for ‚Ç¨16.8 billion. Within this package ABN AMRO was the largest component. The plan was that ABN AMRO and the Dutch part of Fortis would be integrated and eventually sold. On 1 July 2010 the bank completed the final stage of a complex restructuring, that saw the creation of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Madoff fraud As a result of the alleged fraud by Bernard Madoff, Fortis Bank Netherlands (Holding) NV lost 1 billion euros on loans from the bank (through its subsidiary Prime Fund Solutions, part of Fortis Merchant Banking) to hedge fund and as collateral investments in Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.Declaration on the fraud Madoff The Dutch government said on behalf of Fortis that a claim against the Securities and Exchange Commission would be considered.  Name  On November 21, 2008 Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos announced that Fortis and ABN AMRO would be merged. Until then, the banks would operate independently as Fortis Bank and ABN AMRO Netherlands. After the merger was complete the bank used the name ABN AMRO for the combined bank, and the bank was officially renamed on 1 July 2010. The remaining parts of the original ABN AMRO still owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland would be renamed, sold or closed down.

Built in the 16th century, it was Esher's parish church for 300 years, though later worshippers included Queen Victoria. However, by the mid-19th century the building was deemed too small for the growing population, and was replaced by Christ Church, built nearby on Esher Green in 1853/4. St George's was not therefore subjected to Victorian ‚Äòimprovements‚Äô, and its Tudor origins remain evident. It is now cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust. History Esher is mentioned in the Domesday Book, but there is no mention of a church; the first record of a patron and rector appears in 1292, but little remains of any previous building, except a doorway on the south side of the nave and the priest's door (now walled in) on the north side of the chancel, both probably 15th century. A rare example of an English church built during the Reformation, the present building was built about 1540 of a jumbled assortment of chequered sandstone, clunch, undressed flint and brick, and roofed with both stone and clay tiles, with a small oaken timber bell- or clock-turret with pyramid spire. Inside, the Tudor open roof remains, with timber tie and collar beams; referring to its vernacular construction, Simon Jenkins says: \\". . . St. George's cannot decide whether it is a barn masquerading as a chapel, or a chapel masquerading as a barn.\\"Jenkins (1999), p. 675. The wooden clock-turret houses the original clock mechanism from the early 17th century, the face and hour hand being added in 1783. Various additions made in the 18th and early 19th centuries include the three-decker pulpit and reredos of 1722 with fine carving, the Newcastle Pew (1725-26), and the brick north aisle with crenellated gables (1812). Interior: Newcastle Pew on right; pulpit & reredos on left =Newcastle Pew= In 1725‚Äì26 a brick extension, with a slate roof and its own entrance, was added to the south side of the church. The extension contains a remarkable family chamber pew built to Sir John Vanbrugh‚Äôs design for the 1st Duke of Newcastle, who had purchased Vanbrugh's nearby country house, Claremont, and therefore worshipped at St George's, as did Newcastle's brother, Henry Pelham of Esher Place. Connected to the body of the church through a bay in the south wall, the pew has a temple front of eight Corinthian columns and pilasters surmounted by a pediment of pine. The Georgian interior of the pew was later divided into two sets of three boxes, the inhabitants of Claremont sitting on the right, and those of Esher Place on the left, each with their own fireplace. Vanbrugh also replaced the Tudor windows of the church with those of Georgian style: the only remaining stained glass window was removed to the Great Hall of Wadham College, Oxford. George II‚Äôs royal coat of arms hangs from the chancel beam. The Duke of Newcastle's successors at Claremont would all have worshipped at St George's at some time. These include Princess Charlotte, only child of George IV and heiress presumptive to the throne, who died at Claremont; her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, later first King of the Belgians; his niece by marriage, the young Princess Victoria; her youngest son Leopold; and Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone. A sculpted triptych memorial to Charlotte and Leopold, commissioned in 1870 from Francis John Williamson by Queen Victoria and originally in their former home, Claremont, stands at the west end of the north aisle. St George‚Äôs today After Christ Church was built, St George's fell into some disrepair, but it was restored by the community in 1965, and remains a consecrated building, now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and supported locally by the Friends of St George's Church.The Friends of St George's Church St George's is not open every day, but several services are held each year. It can also be visited on Saturday mornings during the summer, and is a periodic venue for music and the arts. The church may be visited by borrowing a key from an adjacent property (Monday to Saturday inclusive). Notes References * Blatch, Mervyn (1997). The Churches of Surrey.

The battle was one of the first engagements between the two forces during the war and occurred when A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) struck a Viet Cong bunker system defended by Company 238 in the Gang Toi Hills, in northern Bien Hoa Province. It occurred during a major joint US-Australian operation codenamed Operation Hump, involving the US 173rd Airborne Brigade, to which 1 RAR was attached. During the latter part of the operation an Australian rifle company clashed with an entrenched company-sized Viet Cong force in well-prepared defensive positions. Meanwhile, an American paratroop battalion was also heavily engaged in fighting on the other side of the Song Dong Nai. The Australians were unable to concentrate sufficient combat power to launch an assault on the position and consequently they were forced to withdraw after a fierce engagement during which both sides suffered a number of casualties, reluctantly leaving behind two men who had been shot and could not be recovered due to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire. Although they were most likely dead, a battalion-attack to recover the missing soldiers was planned by the Australians for the next day, but this was cancelled by the American brigade commander due to rising casualties and the need to utilise all available helicopters for casualty evacuation. The bodies of the two missing Australian soldiers were subsequently recovered more than 40 years later, and were finally returned to Australia for burial. Background =Military situation= Although the initial American commitment to the war in Vietnam had been limited to advice and materiel support, by 1964 there were 21,000 US advisors in South Vietnam. However, with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) weakened by successive defeats at the hands of the communists, the South Vietnamese government faltering, and Saigon threatened with a major offensive, the situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965, with a large-scale commitment of US ground troops under the command of General William Westmoreland. At first the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy, applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by US Marine units. This was abandoned in April 1965, and replaced by a new \\"enclave strategy\\" of defending key coastal population centres and installations. This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US battalions, or 14,000 troops, to bring the total in Vietnam to 13. Allied nations of the Free World Military Forces were expected to contribute another four battalions. alt=A map illustrating locations referred to in the text. Westmoreland planned to develop a series of defensive positions around Saigon before expanding operations to pacify the South Vietnamese countryside and as a result a number of sites close to Viet Cong dominated areas were subsequently chosen to be developed into semi-permanent divisional-level bases. Such areas included Di An which was intended to become the headquarters of the US 1st Infantry Division, while the US 25th Infantry Division would be based in the vicinity of Cu Chi. However, large-scale military operations to clear the intended base areas had to wait until the dry season. Yet the allied enclave strategy proved only transitory and further setbacks led to additional troop increases to halt the losing trend. With the situation reaching a crisis point during the Viet Cong wet season offensive in June 1965, Westmoreland requested further reinforcement and US and allied forces increased to 44 battalions which would be used to directly bolster the ARVN. Australia's growing involvement in Vietnam reflected the American build-up. In 1963, the Australian government had committed a small advisory team, known as the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV), to help train the South Vietnamese forces. However, in June 1965 the decision to commit ground troops was made, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment‚Äîoriginally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan 'Lou' Brumfield‚Äîwas dispatched. Supporting 1 RAR was the 1 Troop, A Squadron, 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse equipped with M113 armored personnel carriers, artillery from the 105th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery and 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery, and 161st Reconnaissance Flight operating Cessna 180s and Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters; in total 1,400 personnel. The Australian units and New Zealand artillery were attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade under the command of Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson in Bien Hoa and operated throughout the III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ) to help establish the Bien Hoa‚ÄìVung Tau enclave. Although logistics and resupply were primarily provided by the Americans, a small logistic unit‚Äî1st Australian Logistics Company‚Äîwas situated at Bien Hoa airbase. Unlike later Australian units that served in Vietnam, which included conscripts, 1 RAR was manned by regular personnel only. Attached to US forces, 1 RAR was primarily employed in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery into an area of operations, and to support them with aerial mobility, fire support, casualty evacuation, and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D‚Äîa major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces‚Äîas well as in the Iron Triangle in November. Prelude =Opposing forces= By late-1965 the junction of the Song Be and Song Dong Nai rivers had become a major communist staging area for men, equipment, and supplies for units based around Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Communist communications and resupply routes between War Zone C and D also met the Ho Chi Minh Trail in this area. Westmoreland planned to use the US 173rd Airborne Brigade to keep the Viet Cong off balance and to target their base areas, and consequently a search-and-destroy operation codenamed \\"Operation Hump\\" was planned. Operation Hump marked the half-way point in the twelve-month tour of duty of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and was named accordingly. The concept of operations envisioned 1 RAR and 1st Battalion, US 503rd Infantry Regiment being inserted by helicopter during an airmobile operation into War Zone D, in an area about north-east of the Bien Hoa Air Base. The Australian and American area of operations (AO) was to be separated by the Song Dong Nai, with 1 RAR to deploy into a landing zone (LZ) to the south, while the US 1/503rd Battalion would conduct a helicopter assault onto a LZ northwest of the Song Dong Nai and Song Be. Meanwhile, the US 173rd Airborne Brigade's second battalion‚Äî2nd Battalion, US 503rd Infantry Regiment‚Äîwould be left to defend Bien Hoa airbase. The area was thought to be a Viet Cong stronghold and American intelligence initially identified Q762 Main Force Regiment and D800 Main Force Battalion as being nearby. However, unknown to the allied force, the Viet Cong 9th Division had likely received forewarning of the operation and had deployed one of its most experienced regiments, supported by a number of local force battalions, determined for a test of allied strength. The 271 VC Main Force Regiment (also known as Q761 Main Force Regiment) subsequently took up defensive positions in the area, while the communist U1 headquarters protected by Company 238, was situated on the plateau atop the Gang Toi Hills in an area which formed part of 1 RAR's objective. U1 was responsible for co-ordinating the Viet Cong regional defence against the Bien Hoa air base and for developing anti-government resistance and had been tasked with rebuilding the covert organisation in Bien Hoa city and the surrounding villages up to the Dong Nai, as well as re-establishing the link between Bien Hoa city and War Zone D, and for planning and executing attacks against the air base itself. Yet having relocated to the rainforest two months earlier, its presence was also unknown to the Australians and Americans. Regardless, A Company 1 RAR was scheduled to conduct a search of the plateau on the fourth day of the operation. Battle =Insertion and patrolling, 5‚Äì7 November 1965= alt=A map illustrating locations referred to in the text. On 5 November 1 RAR began the routine search-and-destroy operation, inserting by helicopter south of the Song Dong Nai at 08:00, while the US 1/503rd Battalion was inserted onto LZ King north-west of the Song Dong Nai and Song Be rivers at 11:00. The operation started badly for the Australians and Americans with the fly-in delayed. Despite a lengthy preparation by fire, a large Viet Cong force had been observed in the vicinity of LZ Queen prior to the insertion of the lead Australian rifle company‚ÄîD Company under the command of Captain Peter Rothwell. The escorting helicopter gunships began taking small arms fire as they attempted to provide suppressing fire and Rothwell made the decision to activate the alternate landing zone to the north-east, LZ Princess. D Company was subsequently inserted safely and swept back to LZ Queen, securing it for the remainder of the battalion. By mid-morning 1 RAR occupied LZ Queen, with the 105 mm L5 pack howitzers of 105 Field Battery also flying-in to provide direct support. Augmenting the Australian gunners, the US 3/319 Artillery Battalion and 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery occupied FSB Ace further south. The scheme of manoeuvre adopted by 1 RAR dictated that each company undertake a dispersed patrol program in their own tactical area of responsibility, a fact which would allow them to search more ground, but limit their ability to concentrate combat power in the event of contact. A Company, under Major John Healy, patrolled east; B Company moved north along the Song Be to Xom Xoai, while D Company patrolled south. C Company remained at LZ Queen to protect 105 Field Battery which had established a fire support base (FSB). Over the next two days the Australians patrolled relentlessly through the leech-infested swamps and dense jungle. At midday on 6 November A Company received two mortar rounds which failed to do any damage, but marked the start of a series of minor clashes. A Company had a number of contacts during this time, with the Australians killing a Viet Cong scout for the loss of two wounded in one skirmish. A further contact soon after resulted in two more Viet Cong killed and one wounded. Intelligence gained from these incidents indicated the presence of a Viet Cong Main Force Regiment in the area, while documents recovered contained plans for attacks on ARVN outposts near Bien Hoa Airbase. By nightfall on 7 November, despite the earlier contacts, no major actions had occurred in the Australian AO. With the rifle companies now several kilometres apart, A Company had patrolled into a network of well used roads and tracks that formed part of a branch of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Healy's men spent the night astride the tracks and would resume patrolling the following day along a track which led to Hill 82. Meanwhile, although unknown to them at the time, the US 1/503rd Battalion across the Song Dong Nai had patrolled to within of a major Viet Cong bunker system sited on two spur lines in the vicinity of Hill 65. =Hill 82, 8 November 1965= Brumfield arrived by helicopter on the morning of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon. The Australians continued in single file towards the top of the plateau, with 1 Platoon‚Äîunder Sergeant Gordon Peterson‚Äîleading, followed by 2 and then 3 Platoon. The going was slow in the dense jungle and visibility was limited. By 16:30 the lead section was nearing the top of the hill having gone just , while the last platoon‚Äî3 Platoon‚Äîwas still leaving the harbour. Suddenly, 1 Platoon was hit by heavy small arms fire from at least three Viet Cong machine-guns in well-sited bunkers, supported by rifles and grenades. The fire engulfed the lead section and platoon headquarters, causing five casualties in the opening minute. Pinned down, the Australians went to ground and began returning fire, allowing all except one of the wounded to crawl to safety. Private Richard Parker, who had fallen directly in front of the bunker system, was unable to be recovered. Failing to respond to the shouts of his comrades, Parker was exposed to further hits, although was probably already dead. To support the beleaguered platoon, Healy subsequently ordered the support section from company headquarters to move forward to provide covering fire, while 3 Platoon moved up on the left flank. However, due to the dispersed patrolling plan adopted, the remaining companies were unable to provide any assistance. Still at the bottom of the hill, 3 Platoon‚Äîunder Second Lieutenant Clive Williams‚Äîhad just shot and killed two Viet Cong moving along the creek line. Reaching the top of the hill to the left of company headquarters, Williams turned to the right towards the Viet Cong positions. Moving into extended line on a front the Australians had advanced just before the left flank was engaged by a number of machine-guns from another sector of the Viet Cong position. In danger of being outflanked, 3 Platoon continued to advance regardless, using fire and movement. Just from the bunkers Private Peter Gillson, the machine-gunner in the forward section, was shot as he tried to move around the twisted roots of a tall tree. As he fell two Viet Cong rushed forward to take the M60 machine- gun; however, Gillson was still conscious and they were killed at point blank range before he collapsed. Williams radioed Healy of the increasing danger while his platoon sergeant‚ÄîSergeant Colin Fawcett‚Äîhad crawled forward under heavy fire to Gillson, whose body was wedged in the buttress of a large tree. Unable to find a pulse, Fawcett attempted to extract Gillson, but was unable to do so due to heavy fire. Two other attempts to recover the body were also beaten back, and although unsuccessful, Fawcett was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Taking heavy fire from both the front and flanks, Williams had little choice but to withdraw. With the Viet Cong moving rapidly to encircle them, and unable to move forward, the Australians had to fight using small arms fire and grenades to extract themselves back to company headquarters without further casualties. However, by this time the artillery was beginning to have an impact as A Company's forward observer, Captain Bruce Murphy, a New Zealander, directed the fires. The Australians had unavoidably been placed in the worst possible position to their supporting artillery, with 105 Battery firing on a line directly towards them from their gun-line on the other side of the Gang Toi plateau. Consequently, Murphy was unable to observe the fall of shot, and had to walk the rounds onto target by sound. A slight miscalculation could have sent a round over the hill into the Australian positions, regardless, and despite persistent rifle and machine-gun fire, Murphy calmly directed the artillery throughout the battle. For his skill and bravery he was later awarded the Military Cross. By 18:30, more than two hours since the fighting began, darkness was approaching. The battalion would be unable to concentrate against the Viet Cong position until the following day, and Healy subsequently made the decision to withdraw. With the artillery falling as close as possible, the weight of the indirect fires provided the Australians with a degree of protection and an opportunity to extricate themselves. Lieutenant Ian Guild's 2 Platoon was subsequently moved into position to cover the withdrawal, and carrying their wounded the Australians successfully broke contact without suffering further losses. A Company initially moved to a landing zone below the ridgeline which had been cleared to allow the casualties to be evacuated, yet there were no helicopters available. As a result, the Australians had to look after their casualties until the following morning, and they proceeded further north to a night harbour as the area was pounded by artillery, aerial bombing and helicopter gunships. Healy assessed that his company had encountered a force of at least company-size. Later it became apparent that they had indeed contacted Company 238 which was tasked with protecting the U1 headquarters and to carry out operations in the Bien Hoa region. Throughout the day Viet Cong reconnaissance parties, perhaps including those that had been contacted intermittently, had observed the approaching Australian force on a line leading directly to the U1 headquarters. During the fighting the Viet Cong company commander‚ÄîNguyen Van Bao‚Äîhad split his force into two, allocating one platoon to fight the advancing Australians, and the other two to protect the headquarters. Following the Australian withdrawal Van Bao had also withdrawn, pre-empting the ensuing barrage, yet the U1 base remained in communist hands. =Fighting across the Song Dong Nai= alt=A soldier laying prone on the ground with his back to camera. Through the broken foliage and smoke other soldiers can be seen. Meanwhile, across the river in the American AO the US 1/503rd Battalion had uncovered a large Viet Cong bunker system and became involved in fierce fighting that had included desperate hand-to-hand combat, with both sides resorting to using bayonets. Throughout the morning the Australians had heard the increasing crescendo of firing as the battle raged; however, as neither they nor the US 2/503rd Battalion had been called on to reinforce the US 1/503rd Battalion they had pressed on. The American paratroopers had contacted a well-equipped Viet Cong Main Force regiment, complete with khaki uniforms, steel helmets and Soviet automatic weaponry and small arms. The fighting across the Song Dong Nai continued into the afternoon, before subsiding into sporadic sniper and small arms fire in the later afternoon and early evening. During the fighting, Specialist Lawrence Joel‚Äîa medic‚Äîdistinguished himself tending to his wounded comrades while under heavy fire. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor. Brumfield demanded the right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker system and to recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark‚Äîthe operations officer‚Äîbegan planning a battalion attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation, the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. A battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent on the availability of air and helicopter support, and the start date of the upcoming Operation New Life. Ultimately it was never conducted. Aftermath =Casualties= The Battle of Gang Toi was the first set-piece action between Australian and Viet Cong forces in the Vietnam War. Australian casualties included two missing (presumed killed) and six wounded, and despite the efforts of their comrades, the bodies of the Australian dead were unable to be recovered. Against these losses the Viet Cong had suffered at least six killed, one wounded and five captured. Confronted by an equal sized force, dug-in in well-prepared defences, the Australians had performed creditably enough even if they had been forced to withdraw, leaving the battlefield to the Viet Cong. Despite inflicting heavier casualties on the communists than they had suffered themselves, many of the Australians were depressed at having left two soldiers behind, and they longed for the opportunity to return to Gang Toi. In 2007, more than 40 years after the fighting, an Australian Vietnam veteran‚ÄîJim Bourke, MG‚Äîand a team of volunteers successfully located the remains of both Parker and Gillson. They had been hastily buried together in a weapon pit the day after the battle by Viet Cong soldiers, and with the assistance of the Australian and Vietnamese governments they were subsequently returned to Australia for burial. =Assessment= Although A Company, 1 RAR had been mauled, the experience of the Australians at Gang Toi was relatively minor when compared to that of the Americans. During fierce fighting the US 1/503rd Battalion had suffered 40 killed and 51 wounded, while more than 400 Viet Cong were believed killed. American claims were later raised to over 700 killed when captured documents revealed the losses caused by artillery and air strikes. Yet it was questionable as to whether such battles of attrition would be viable, while equally the American battalion had taken casualties far beyond what would have been politically acceptable for 1 RAR. Indeed, their losses had been significant, and although claimed as a victory, the Americans had failed to secure the area even if the Viet Cong had temporarily surrendered control of the battlefield. Ultimately, the communists continued to use the Bien Hoa area as a major supply route for the rest of the war. Brumfield considered Operation Hump to be the least successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece. =Subsequent operations= At the strategic level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on the verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade‚Äîthe 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)‚Äîwith armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.

The nebula is several thousand light years from Earth, and its central star is a symbiotic Mira variable - white dwarf pair. It is named for its resemblance to the Crab Nebula, which is in the northern sky. The Southern Crab was noted in a 1967 catalog, and was also observed using a CCD imager with the 2.2 meter telescope at the La Sila observatory in 1989. The 1989 observation marked a major expansion of knowledge about the nebula, and it was observed using various filters. The nebula had already been observed using Earth-based telescopes, but images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999 have provided much more detail, revealing that at the center of the nebula are a pair of stars, a red giant and a white dwarf. It was imaged again by HST in 2019 with a newer instrument. In 1999 it was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, noted for its unique \\"stair-step\\" crop and for such astrophotos as the Pillars of Creation. The WFPC2 images were taken at a optical light wavelength of 658 nm. The nebula was imaged again by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2019, and a set of images to celebrate the anniversary of the space telescope's launch in 1990 (29 years) by the Space Shuttle. This time a newer camera the WFC3 was used to image the nebula, at wavelengths filters of about 502, 656, 658, and 673 nanometers. The designation He2-104 (or Hen 2-104) comes from the Henize catalog of 1967, Observations of Southern Planetary Nebulae. The catalog includes 459 items identified as planetary nebula (or likely as such). (note that in this meaning it does not imply exoplanets) Another designation that it has been recorded for this object is WRAY-16-47.15677 - Spectroscopy and Imaging of the Southern Crab Nebul In 2008, an investigation of the Southern Crab with its symbiotic (astronomical term) star was published. The study used imaging and spectroscopic data from space and Earth-surface telescopes including Hubble and VLT observatories. The ESO defines a symbiotic star system as \\"binaries in which a small hot star (white dwarf or main sequence star) orbits around a red giant star.

She was the medical director of the first birth control clinic in Canada, located in Hamilton, Ontario. Early life Bagshaw was born on a farm in Mariposa Township, Victoria County, Ontario, the youngest of four daughters of John and Eliza Bagshaw. Bagshaw's sister, Annie, remarked that from a young age she had a brilliant memory, and school work came easily for her. Her father died in July 1904 in a farm accident, which left Bagshaw in charge of the family farm which spanned 89 hectares. By the first week of October 1904, Bagshaw sold the farm, and moved both her mother and a sister with her to Toronto to finish her final year of medical school. Education Bagshaw registered at the University of Toronto in September 1901 as an occasional student; this enabled her to obtain a degree from this university while taking most of her courses at the neighbouring Ontario Medical College for Women, which would later become Women's College Hospital. Here she gained practical experience seeing prenatal patients at a maternity clinic. In 1905 Elizabeth became Doctor Bagshaw and graduated from the University of Toronto. After graduation, Bagshaw apprenticed under Emma Leila Skinner who was an 1896 graduate of the University of Toronto. There she learned of maternity work, and the economic struggles patients often had in affording and seeing a doctor. Career After working in Hamilton, Ontario for the summer of 1906, Bagshaw moved to that city and set up her own medical practice. During the Spanish flu epidemic, Bagshaw had approximately 25‚Äì30 maternity cases per month. In 1934, Bagshaw entered politics, seeking to fill the Ward 1 aldermanic seat being vacated by Nora-Frances Henderson, one of Hamilton's first elected female local politicians who sought election to the city's Board of Control. Despite a strong campaign, Bagshaw placed third, a loss the Hamilton Spectator attributed to her running against the area's long- serving school trustee, Orville Walsh.\\"Labour forces suffer defeat at polls,\\" Hamilton Spectator, December 4, 1934, p. 15. From 1932 until 1966, Bagshaw was the medical director of Canada's first birth control clinic. Over the course of her career she delivered thousands of babies, including one delivered by the light of kerosene lamps from her car. She retired at the age of 95 in 1976, the oldest practicing physician in Canada at the time. She became a centenarian in 1981. Personal life Shortly before World War I, Bagshaw met Lou Honey, a Canadian soldier, who was killed shortly after enlisting in 1915. She also corresponded with a man named Jimmie Dickinson while at the University of Toronto and kept in touch with him for years after their graduation in 1905. At the time of the Spanish flu epidemic he was living in Western Canada, contracted Spanish flu, developed pneumonia and died. In 1921, nearing her 40th birthday, Bagshaw began a friendship with Rocco Perri, a man known as the king of bootleggers. Bagshaw attended church her whole life and belonged to a temperance organization; however, she had a tendency to become involved with law-breakers. During this same period, in February 1926, she received a phone call telling her that her second cousin, Bernice, was ill. When Bernice died, Bagshaw cared for her son, John. At the age of 45 she adopted him, calling her lawyer and avoiding Children's Aid completely, reasoning that \\"they would never give a child to an unmarried woman.\\" Both her son, and her daughter-in-law would eventually become doctors and work in the same office she started in Hamilton. Dr. Bagshaw was an avid golfer, and a charter member of Glendale Golf & Country Club when it was founded in 1919. Dr. Bagshaw's son John, in a note to the golf club, said that he had only seen his mother cry twice in her life. The first time was when her beloved Glendale's original clubhouse burned to the ground in 1936. Awards and distinctions In 1970, she was awarded Hamilton's Citizen of the Year. On April 11, 1973, Bagshaw was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada. In 1978, the National Film Board of Canada produced a film about her called Doctor Woman: The Life and Times of Dr. Elizabeth Bagshaw. In 1979, she was one of the first seven women to receive the Governor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case \\"to recognize outstanding contributions to the quality of life of women in Canada\\". In 2007, she was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. The Elizabeth Bagshaw Elementary School in Hamilton is named in her honour as is the Elizabeth Bagshaw Women's Clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Tracker was recruited from Wellington, a local team and first played in the Victorian Football Association days. A supremely athletic and fit person, it allowed him to ruck for four quarters, often brilliantly and with a dominating effect on his opponents, such was the consistency of his play the opposing rovers tried to feed off his hit outs. Strong and courageous, and a magnificent high mark he displayed a cool temperament and always at the forefront of protecting his teammates with effective shepherding. Tracker sustained serious injury problems in 1898 and 1899, however he made a strong comeback and throughout his career provided tremendous service and was inspirational to his teammates as club captain (137 games as captain). Tracker also won the Geelong Best and Fairest Award (pre- Carji Greeves Medal) in 1905 and 1906.

To friend and foe alike, he always played his hardest, but always played the game, with the result that he had not an enemy among those against whom he competed.

He married Mary, Queen of Scots to Lord Darnley. Family He was the fourth son of Sir Oliver Sinclair of Roslin (d. after 11 April 1510) by his spouse Margaret, daughter of William Borthwick, 2nd Lord Borthwick. John was a younger brother of Henry Sinclair, Bishop of Ross, and their sister Margaret was married to Robert Lauder, of The Bass (d. June 1576). In a Precept of Clare Constat (GD122/1/340, NAS) dated 2 May 1566, John [Sinclair], Bishop of Brechin, is referred to as \\"maternal uncle of Robert Lauder of Popple, knight, heir of Robert Lauder of Bass, and Margaret Sinclare, sister of Robert Sinclare of Over Liberton\\". Career Douglas writes: \\"Dr.John Sinclair, bred to the church, a man of great piety and learning, and for his extraordinary knowledge of our laws, was first appointed one of the Ordinary Lords of Session, then Lord President 'in his brother's place' [handwritten note in margin]. He was 'Dean of Restalrig near Edinburgh and was' [handwritten note in margin] afterwards preferred to the Bishoprick of Brechin\\". Before December 1537 he was Prebendary of Corstorphine. Afterwards, as Rector of Snaw, John Sinclair was admitted as an Ordinary Lord in the Court of Session on 27 April 1540. He was afterwards appointed by King James V, confirmed by a Bull of Pope Paul III dated 27 August 1542, as Dean of the Church of St. Mary of Restalrig, a valuable benefice stated to be ¬£60 sterling. He attended his brother Henry to France in 1564, and brought back with him to Scotland the materials which Henry had amassed for a continuation of Boece's History of Scotland. He also succeeded Henry as Lord President of the Court of Session. Shortly after July 1565 he was promoted to the Episcopal See of Brechin, but did not long enjoy the dignity, dying the following year. Marriage of the Queen As Dean of Restalrig, he had the honour of marrying Mary, Queen of Scots to Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley in Holyrood Abbey on 29 July 1565. Works There is speculation as to whether the work entitled Sinclair's Practicks should be attributed to him or his brother Henry. There are two manuscript copies of this work preserved in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh, and one of them is stated by Ruddiman, in an Introductory Note, to have been transcribed from the original MSS, then in the possession of Lord Pitmedden. The decisions commence on 1 June 1540 and are continued until 28 May 1549. Death In April 1566 the Bishop of Brechin \\"was seized with fever\\", and died. In a long \\"Instrument\\" dealing with the disputed redemption of property, in favour of Robert Lawder of Popple, knight, dated 9 May 1573, Sir Robert is referred to specifically as \\"heir of Mr.John Sinclair, Dean of Restalrig\\".

The prototype, D-EVEO, was powered by a Hirth HM506 inverted, air-cooled inline-6 engine. The aircraft showed \\"astonishing agility\\" at its first public appearance, the 1936 International Aerobatic Championship at Rangsdorf, but the B√º 133A garnered no orders; only two B√º 133Bs, with version of that same Hirth HM506 inline-6 engine, were built. The main production type was the Siemens-Bramo Sh 14A radial powered B√º 133C, which had a distinctive cowling and a -shorter fuselage, and the same fine aerobatic performance as the B√º 133A. Fifty-two were manufactured under licence by Dornier for the Swiss Air Force (which kept it in service until 1968). A similar number were built for the Spanish Air Force by CASA, and were designated the CASA 1-133. Operational history Blackpool (Squires Gate) Airport in 1957 The B√º 133C racked up numerous victories in international aerobatic competition, and by 1938 was the Luftwaffes standard advanced trainer. At the Brussels meet that year, a three-man Luftwaffe team made a strong impression on Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, who ordered a nine-man team be formed. It dazzled the crowds at the International Flying meet in Brussels the next year. The Jungmeister design remained competitive in international aerobatic competition into the 1960s.

Robertson was born in Glasgow. From age 8 he worked as a herd boy in Ayrshire, but eventually went on to gain a medical degree. His interests turned to the study of Natural History in the town he regularly visited, Millport, in the Firth of Clyde. He studied the local flora and fauna and established Millport as a significant area for marine biological research. In 1885 he had the 'Ark', an old floating laboratory, drawn up on shore, at Port Loy, Cumbrae. He persuaded members of the professional and business community in Glasgow to fund a permanent marine research station there. Work was progressing on the building of the present Marine Station and museum when Robertson died aged 90. The station opened in 1897 and consisted of a laboratory, museum, and public aquarium. Robertson was assisted in his collecting by his second wife Hannah Robertson. With George Stewardson Brady (1832‚Äì1921) and HW Crosskey he wrote A Monograph of the Post-Tertiary Entomostraca of Scotland, printed for the Palaeontographical Society. With Crosskey he wrote on the post-tertiary fossiliferous beds of Scotland (Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow). Robertson was known as 'The Cumbrae Naturalist'.

In the 14th century, Urasoe was the largest castle on the island, but today only ruins remain. Description The castle ruins lie behind the modern city of Urasoe, on the northern edge of Naha, today the capital of Okinawa Prefecture. It sits roughly 130-140m above sea level, and consists of two sections, arranged for the most part along a northwest‚Äìsoutheast axis. The Kogusuku (old castle) and Migusuku together cover an area roughly 380m long by 60-70m wide, the kogusuku being on a slightly higher rise to the east of the migusuku. A series of interconnected enclosures cross the site from east‚Äìwest. As much of the site has been extensively damaged, both historically and more recently, the overall size, layout and structure of the castle is difficult to ascertain, along with many other aspects of its history and use. A series of four separate ramparts and palisades defended the lower portion of the castle, along with a moat that has been dated to the late 14th or early 15th century. The upper portion of the castle, like many other gusuku, was situated in such a way that it was sufficiently defended by sheer cliffs and the sea and likely lacked significant defensive walls or ramparts. The oldest Buddhist temples in Okinawa, the Ryufuku-ji and Gokuraku-ji, are nearby, along with Urasoe y≈çdore, the site of the royal mausolea of several kings of Ch≈´zan, dug directly into the cliffside. King Eiso (r. 1260‚Äì1299) ruled Ch≈´zan from Urasoe, and is entombed near the northwest cliff of the castle. His mausoleum contains three stone coffins from China, possibly from Fujian; it is believed that Eiso is buried in the largest one, his father and grandfather in the other two. The coffins are decorated with birds, flowers, deer, shishi (lion-dogs), and various Buddhist images, along with dragons and phoenixes on the lids, which are designed to look like tiled roofs. Eiso lived in the 13th century, however, based on the style of designs and decorations on the coffins, archaeologists believe these to be of later, 15th-century, construction. King Sh≈ç Nei (r. 1597‚Äì1620), is also entombed here. Excavations in the last decades of the 20th century uncovered a ceremonial path leading from the castle to the tombs, along with the remains of an artificial lake, a tunnel entrance to the castle, and a series of residences believed to have belonged to a noble family. Over 30,000 artifacts were recovered from these excavations. History As royal capital, Urasoe represents the first instance of a major shift in the construction of elite structures, and castles (gusuku) in particular, in Okinawa. It is believed to have been grander in scale and complexity than sites which came before. Most of what is known about the castle's history comes from archaeological excavations, and not from narrative historical documentation. Low stone walls and post-holes indicate the original form of the castle, constructed in the late 13th‚Äìearly 14th centuries. Over the next century or so, the castle was expanded, and came to encompass what is today labeled the kogusuku. Korean roof tiles were used in the expansions and construction at this time. Significant portions of the castle were taken away in the early 16th century to aid in the construction of Shuri Castle. The castle remained in use, however, and Sh≈ç Iko, the son of King Sh≈ç Shin, took up residence there in 1509. Finding it largely in ruins, he oversaw its refurbishment, and it is believed he moved the residential section of the castle from the kogusuku to the migusuku at this time. The castle was burned and destroyed in the 1609 invasion of Ryukyu by Satsuma, along with the Ryufuku-ji temple which sat below it on the hillside. The castle and the ridge it was built upon were also a Japanese defensive position during the Battle of Okinawa. Desmond Doss earned his Medal of Honor by lowering injured men down the cliff on the North side of the castle. Many scholars have traditionally seen the establishment of Shuri as royal capital as bringing with it great changes and developments in the representation of the monarchy. However, some scholars today believe that \\"the form for the royal capital at Shuri, which included a central palace (seiden), a plaza for gathering allied elites and subjects, a ritual area, a large external pond, and attached Buddhist temples, was already complete at Urasoe\\".Asato, S. (1997). Shurijo izen no ogusuku, Urasoe gusuku no chosa (Investigation of Urasoe Castle, the royal castle before Shuri). Nihon Rekishi 585: 116‚Äì113. Quoted in Pearson (2001), p 271. Archaeologists point out in particular the wealth, power, and aesthetic grandeur indicated by elements of the site's structures. Roof tiles and other items, mostly ceramics, were imported from Korea, and stone coffins carved in the Chinese style, likely in Fujian, were also imported, indicating the tiny kingdom's extensive trade and diplomatic connections; items from Korea, in particular, are known to have been quite rare and expensive in Okinawa for many centuries, and have been excavated only in the most elite of sites. The Buddhist temples on the site indicate strong political and cultural connections to Japan, and the large pond or lake below the castle is a common symbol of elite power and prestige throughout East Asia.

After the war, he served in numerous civilian posts. Early life Huntington was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the son of Jabez and Elizabeth (Backus) Huntington. Huntington graduated from Harvard in 1763 and received a master's degree from Yale University in 1770. He was engaged in commercial pursuits with his father, was an active member of the Sons of Liberty, and of the Committee of Correspondence established at Norwich on 6 June 1774. Appearance He was a slightly built man: \\"His greatness was rather intellectual and moral than physical, as there is in existence a memorandum of the weighing of several revolutionary officers at West Point, August 19, 1788; when Gen. Washington weighed 209 pounds, Gen. Lincoln, 224, Gen. Knox, 280, and Gen. Huntington, 132.\\" Military career As the war approached, Huntington became an active officer in the Norwich militia. He was appointed ensign of the first Norwich militia company in October 1769, became a lieutenant in 1771, and a captain in May 1774. In October 1774, Huntington was made Colonel of the 20th Regiment of Connecticut Militia. When Israel Bissell brought the Lexington Alarm to Norwich on April 20, 1775, he personally delivered it to Colonel Huntington, who immediately got his men ready to march. On April 26 they arrived in Wrentham, Massachusetts, and a few days later they were in Roxbury and became part of the Siege of Boston. About May 20, 1775, Colonel Huntington traveled the 65 miles back to Norwich to put his affairs in order before returning to his command. While there, he arranged for his wife Faith and some of the other officer's wives to travel back to Roxbury to join their husbands at the siege. On their way back, the axle of their carriage was broken in an accident on June 13 near Providence, RI, and their journey was delayed. They arrived back in Roxbury just in time to see the bloody aftermath of the Battle of Bunker Hill. The shock of seeing this, and the realization of the danger her family was in, caused Faith to start having bouts of serious depression. Despite the best efforts of the family she continued to deteriorate and hanged herself on November 24, 1775. In July 1775, the Connecticut Assembly ordered the creation of the 8th Regiment and gave command to Colonel Huntington. The men were recruited mainly in New London, Hartford, and Windham Counties and included much of Huntington's 20th regiment. The regiment was stationed on the Long Island Sound until September 14 when, on requisition from Washington, it was ordered to the Boston Camps and took its post at Roxbury in Gen. Spencer's Brigade. The 8th remained active until expiration of the terms of service in December 1775. As part of the January 1, 1776 organization of the Continental Army, Huntington's 8th Connecticut Regiment became the 17th Continental Regiment. Originally planned to have a strength of 728 officers and men, by the end of January the 17th only had about 400 men, as did most of the other regiments. Indeed, maintaining soldiers past their terms of service was a problem for the Continental Army. In a letter to Jabez Huntington, Colonel Huntington said, \\"we shall not with all our Rhetoric be able to retain many,\\" On March 4, Huntington's regiment was one of those ordered to take and hold Dorchester Heights, the action that ended the siege by forcing the British to evacuate Boston. The day following the end of the siege, Washington began moving the army to New York. As they passed through Norwich on April 8, Colonel Huntington, Governor Trumbull (Faith's father), and General Washington had dinner at the Huntington home. By April 22, Huntington and most of his unit were in position in New York. Huntington's regiment began fortifying New York City in anticipation of a British attack and it was here they heard of the Declaration of Independence. The 17th had lost men during the Boston siege due to illness and desertion, which continued in New York. On about August 19, Colonel Huntington became seriously ill, possibly with malaria, and was unable to perform his duties, so his second in command Lt. Col. Joel Clark replaced him. On August 24, the regiment was ordered to the Brooklyn front. Because it was so understrength it was placed under the command of Gen. Parsons and combined with Col. Atlee's Pennsylvania regiment. When the Battle of Long Island was fought on the 27th, most of Huntington's regiment was surrounded and taken as prisoners, including Lt. Col. Clark, who died in captivity. The few men left of Huntington's regiment joined the main army under the command of Gen. Heath and evacuated with them as they fled New York. The 17th was never rebuilt and it ceased to exist when enlistments expired at the end of December. When the Continental Army was reorganized as the \\"Continental Line\\" at the beginning of 1777, Colonel Huntington was placed in command of the 1st Regiment. In early April the Connecticut regiments were ordered to Peekskill to join the NY and New England troops for the season. As they were getting organized, the enemy launched the Battle of Ridgefield (also known as the Battle of Danbury) in which Huntington's regiment fought and after that they moved to Peekskill. On May 12, Huntington was promoted to Brigadier general and placed in command of a brigade consisting of three Connecticut regiments. The Connecticut \\"line\\" stayed in Peekskill except for a few excursions. Huntington was ordered to move in support of Washington in the Battle of Brandywine, but the battle was over before they arrived. The Connecticut units were not used in the Saratoga campaign, so Washington moved them from Peekskill to join him at Valley Forge and they spent the bitter winter there. In the spring of 1778 the troops were trained by Gen. Steuben before moving out in June to follow the British out of Philadelphia. General Huntington's brigade was part of the main line after Gen. Lee's retreat at the Battle of Monmouth. Starting on the 4th of July in Brunswick, NJ he was a member of the court-martial of Gen. Lee. At the winter camp in White Plains Gen. Huntington was placed in command of the four regiments in the 2nd Brigade of the Connecticut Division. Washington then moved Huntington's Brigade to Redding for the remainder of the winter. Huntington's Brigade was ordered out of Redding in May 1779 and sent to the Hudson River. In June it was encamped in the highlands on the east side of the river opposite West Point and here they continued construction of three redoubts that had previously been started. In response to Tryon's Raid the entire Connecticut division was ordered to move as quickly as possible in response, but it arrived after Tryon had sailed and they missed the opportunity to defend their own state. About 21 October, the enemy destroyed and abandoned their posts at Stony and Verplanck's Points, so the Connecticut Line was ordered to those locations, where they began repairs. With winter again approaching, the Connecticut units were ordered in mid- November to Morristown to camp with the main army. In early 1780, Huntington's brigade was under the command of Gen. St. Clair because Huntington was on furlough but on 3 April he was reinstated. Since the three-year enlistments of men from 1777 were expiring, General Huntington had to focus on recruiting to maintain the strength of the brigade. It was at this time that the levies (draft) were instated to fill the ranks. On June 7, the two Connecticut brigades (the other being under Gen. Parsons) were placed under the command of Gen. Lafayette and about June 20 left camp to return to the area around West Point. Although the army moved several times in response to enemy activity, little of significance happened that summer. The Connecticut troops were stationed about 40 miles south of West Point on the 26th of September. It was then they heard of the treason of Benedict Arnold and some of the units were positioned around West Point to protect it against a possible enemy attack. After the capture of John Andr√©, General Huntington was appointed one of the members of the board at his trial. The army stayed in this area over the coming winter. In October the Continental Congress ordered a reorganization of the army and the eight previous Connecticut regiments were combined into five new ones and Huntington was placed in command of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th regiments. The Connecticut Line left their winter quarters on June 21, 1781 bound for Peekskill. It was at this camp that the French army soldiers joined the patriots. In August, Gen. Washington took most of the army south, leaving the Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts units behind to guard the highlands. Washington's movement ended at the Siege of Yorktown that effectively ended the war. On June 24, 1783, Washington wrote that the army was \\"reduced to a competent garrison for West Point; Patterson, Huntington, and Greaton being the only brigadiers now left with it, besides the adjutant general.\\" That same month Jedediah Huntington received the brevet rank of major general. The Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally ending the war. Later life After the Revolution, he was one of the first members of the board of foreign missions, and a zealous supporter of charitable institutions. He was one of the organizers of the Society of the Cincinnati. In 1788 he was appointed high sheriff of New London and later the same year the following announcement appeared in the papers: \\"Major General Huntington Esq. Vice President of the order of Cincinnati, High Sheriff for the county of New London, Judge of Probate for the district of Norwich, first Alderman of the city of Norwich, one of the representatives of the town in the State Legislature, and one of the State Electors, is now appointed by the General Assembly Treasurer for the State of Connecticut.\\" Later in 1789, he relinquished most of these duties when President Washington appointed him to be the customs house collector for the coastal area from the Connecticut River to Rhode Island. He held this post, living in New London, until his death in 1818, when he was succeeded by Brigadier General Thomas Humphrey Cushing. Initially buried in New London, his remains were disinterred and laid to rest in the family tomb in Norwich as he requested in his will. Family Anne Moore Huntington In addition to his father being a major general Huntington's brother Andrew, and half-brothers Joshua, Ebenezer, and Zachariah were officers during the war. Huntington's first wife was Faith Trumbull (25 Jan 1742 - 24 Nov 1775), daughter of Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull. Huntington and Faith had a son Jabez (17 Sep 1767 - 16 Aug 1848), before she hanged herself in Dedham (see his service at Boston in 1775). Jabez spent the rest of the war with his grandparents. His brother-in-law John Trumbull painted the original of the picture of Huntington shown on this page. Huntington met Anne Moore in Peekskill, probably when his unit was based there in 1777. Her father was a Loyalist and a member of the High Church while Huntington was a Patriot and a Puritan, but they were married with her father's blessing. Huntington and Anne Moore Huntington had seven children: # Elizabeth Moore, b. 20 Jan 1779; # Ann Channing, b. 9 Oct 1780; # Faith Trumbull, b. 7 Oct 1782, married her distant cousin Benjamin Huntington; were the parents of Daniel Huntington # Harriet Smith, b. 24 Jul 1784; # Joshua, b. 31 Jan 1786; # Daniel, b. 17 Oct 1788 # Thomas, b. 4 Dec 1793; Physician and Baptist evangelist. Legacy The Gen. Jedidiah Huntington House, in Norwichtown, survives and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1970. He entertained many distinguished officers in his house, among whom were Lafayette, Steuben, and Pulaski. When Lauzun's Legion was stationed at Lebanon during the winter of 1780/1, he invited that commander and his officers to a banquet.

Ophelia, a character in William Shakespeare's drama Hamlet, is often referred to in literature and the arts, often in connection to suicide, love, and/or mental instability. Literature Ophelia by John Everett Millais (1852) is part of the Tate Gallery collection. His painting influenced the image in both Laurence Olivier's and Kenneth Branagh's films of Hamlet. Ophelia as appeared in The Works of Shakspere, with notes by Charles Knight, ca. 1873 =Novels= * Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, in the first chapter of his 1880 novel The Brothers Karamazov, described a capricious young woman who committed suicide by throwing herself off a steep cliff into a river, simply to imitate Shakespeare's Ophelia. Dostoevsky concludes that \\"Even then, if the cliff, chosen and cherished from long ago, had not been so picturesque, if it had been merely a flat, prosaic bank, the suicide might not have taken place at all.\\" Dostoevsky also depicts the heroine Grushenka as Ophelia, binding the two through the words \\"Woe is me!\\" in the chapter titled \\"The First Torment\\". * Ophelia's Revenge (2003), a young adult novel by Rebecca Reisert, is a retelling of Hamlet from Ophelia's point of view. * Dating Hamlet (2002), by Lisa Fiedler, tells a version of Ophelia's story. *Agatha Christie's characters refers to Ophelia in the novels After the Funeral (1953), Third Girl (1966) and Nemesis (1971) * In Jasper Fforde's novel Something Rotten (2004) Ophelia tries to take over the play during Hamlet's excursion to the real world. *Ophelia by Lisa Klein tells the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's point of view. *In Paul Griffiths' novel ' (2008) Ophelia tells a narrative using only her words from Hamlet, rearranged.

She is acknowledged to be a pioneer in the Italian erotic magazine publishing sector, who contributed to change the social customs Italy from the second half the 1960s. By launching Playmen, Tattilo engaged publishers like Hugh Hefner and Larry Flynt in an ideological battle to liberate sexual attitudes and free them from bigotry and false moralisms. In the 1960s, Tattilo launched Menelik, a successful weekly magazine of erotic comic strips, featuring the character 'Bernarda'. This periodical came to sell up to 100,000 copies each week. In 1965 Tattilio and her husband, later separated, broke into publishing with a weekly called Big, a magazine for teenage boys, which answered questions of curiosity about sex, reaching sales approaching 400,000 per week. A year later they started Men, a weekly collection of photographs of nude women purchased from Scandinavia or provided by Italian modeling agents. Playmen was founded in 1967, and looked similar to Playboy, which was then banned in Italy. Tattilio reported that Playmen cost $US 640,000 to launch, in 1967, and it had risen to an estimated net worth of $1,600,000 in as soon as 1971. Tattilo made the decisions at Playmen, including cover-girl choices and took risks such as publishing covert paparazzi pictures of Brigitte Bardot sunbathing topless. In the early 1970s, Tattilo's publishing house introduced on the market with a series of books including Dizionario della Letteratura Erotica (Dictionary of Erotic Literature), La Marijuana Fa Bene (Marijuana Does You Good), and Playdux (1973), an erotic history of fascism. In the 1960s and 1970s, Adelina Tattilo fought for a libertarian, radical and socialist view in Italy and cultivated a friendship with Bettino Craxi. She died after a brief illness in Rome, February 1, 2007 at the age of 78.

He won five Ligue 1 titles as a player and four as a manager, and his team lost the 1976 European Cup Final to FC Bayern Munich at Hampden Park. Born in Paris, he moved to Nice as a child as his father played trombone at the Op√©ra de Nice.

Herbin was dismissed by Saint-√âtienne in February 1983 amidst the slush fund scandal that ended their period of national dominance. He was instantly hired by their Rhone derby rivals Olympique Lyonnais and could not prevent their relegation three months later, going on to spend two seasons in Ligue 2 with them. After a big-money job with Al-Nassr FC in Saudi Arabia and work with RC Strasbourg Alsace, he returned to Saint-√âtienne in 1987 but was unable to restore their success over the next three years.

It was founded in 1967 by a mother of three, Adelina Tattilo, achieving fame as Italy's version of Playboy magazine. The magazine was published monthly and featured photographs of nude women, and articles on fashion, sport, consumer goods and public figures. Playmen's use of \\"tasteful\\" nude photos is classified as softcore in contrast to hardcore pornographic magazines. It ceased publication in 2001. Early years During a running battle with the Italian police, the magazine reached a circulation of 450,000 within four years of its 1967 inception. It sold at about the equivalent of a US dollar per copy. Playmen was initially an imitator of Playboy magazine, although the first Girl of the Month, Brigitte Bardot, held her hands to cover her breasts. Playmen later developed a style of its own, reflecting European tastes and not overly displaying breasts as per the American Playboy counterpart. The founder Tattilo is quoted as saying \\"The U.S. is a matriarchy. I think this is the reason for the American male preference for women with exaggerated, voluminous bosoms; true wet nurses with a reassuring maternal aspect.\\" The women Tattilo chose for Playmen were generally more sophisticated than Hugh Hefner's choices. In the early years, with Italy still a religiously conservative society at the time, each month the Italian police in some cities would order a mass seizure of the magazine. Playmen rarely lasted more than 48 hours on the newsstands before either being sold out or seized by the police. Content Many actresses began their careers on the cover of Playmen: Pamela Villoresi, the singer Patty Pravo, the actress Ornella Muti, the singer Amanda Lear and many others. The magazine contained notables such as Teresa Ann Savoy, Barbara Bouchet, Lilli Carati, and Camille Keaton. The July 1968 edition contains an article by Henry Miller. In the December 1972 issue, Playmen obtained an international scoop: it published the photo of Jacqueline Kennedy, then wife of Aristotle Onassis, while she was naked in the swimming pool of their villa in the island of Skorpios. The photos were not published in the United States until Hustler Magazine printed them in 1975. In addition to naked women it occasionally also depicted naked men. It paid John Paul Getty III (who was 16 at the time) $1,000 for a naked photo spread and cover of the August 1973 issue ‚Äì on newsstands a month after the oil empire heir had been kidnapped in Rome. The magazine contained interviews of significant people in literature, cinema, politics, and sport. In the 1990s, with the arrival on the market of pornographic videocassettes, the magazine's sales dropped significantly and advertising revenue sharply declined, causing Tattilo's empire to gradually enter a crisis, followed by the closure of Playmen in 2001.

Town rights were given to Kro≈õcienko by Kazimierz Wielki in 1348. Numerous tourist attractions include Pieniny National Park Museum, the 14th-century church rebuilt in Baroque style in 1589, and in summer, walk trails in the Pieniny mountains. There are holiday cottages and paths for mountain biking both advanced and easy. In winter, ski lift at Szczawnica-Palenica is available at 6 km distance. Kro≈õcienko is one of the oldest settlements in Polish part of the Pieniny Mountains. Its history dates back to the late 12th century, when it was a village serving the now non-existing Pieniny Castle (see also Dunajec river castles). In 1348, Kazimierz Wielki granted Magdeburg rights to Kro≈õcienko, and shaped the village into a medieval town, with a market square and street grid. Royal decree, giving the charter to Kro≈õcienko does not exist, as it was burned in a Hussite raid in 1433. At that time the town was named Crosna in documents. Due to convenient location along a merchant route to Hungary, Kro≈õcienko prospered. In 1350, a Roman Catholic parish was established here, and in 1565, a parish school was opened. The period known as Polish Golden Age ended in the 17th century, when Kro≈õcienko was affected by several wars (see Swedish invasion of Poland, Great Northern War) and rebellions (see Kostka-Napierski Uprising). As a result, by mid-18th century Kro≈õcienko was almost deserted. In 1770, Kro≈õcienko was occupied by the Habsburg Empire. The town became property of Austrian treasury, which in 1822 sold it to the Gross family. New owners noticed local mineral waters, and decided to turn Kro≈õcienko into a spa, with guest houses and baths. In 1934, Kro≈õcienko was officially recognized as a spa. In the Second Polish Republic, it became a very popular tourist resort, located in close proximity to Pieniny National Park. Nevertheless, the number of permanent residents was so low that in 1932 Kro≈õcienko lost its town charter. In 1973, Kro≈õcienko was joined with nearby Szczawnica, and the town of Szczawnica‚ÄìKro≈õcienko was created. In 1982, this idea was abandoned, due to protests of residents.

It has been the seat of the district of Gmina Czorsztyn since 1993. Located on the southern slopes of the Gorce Mountains, new Maniowy was built in 1970-1980s after having been moved to a higher altitude, from an area upon which Czorsztyn Lake now stretches. The history of the old village reached back to at least 1326 when it was founded during the colonisation of the Podhale region. The present village has a modern architecture of houses with several large buildings (for example Saint Nicholas Church and the gym hall) and is inhabited by over 2000 people. Neighbouring forests, mountains, lake, ski lifts and national parks are tourist attractions in each season of the year. On cloudless days a view of nearby Eastern Tatra Mountains can be seen from the village. Village displacement Because of regular flooding of the region (including the flooding of 1934), plans had been drawn up for a dam in the region since 1905,http://www.maniowy.net/historia- wioski/43-przesiedlenie.html and in 1964, a resolution was passed to build the dam on the Dunajec river.http://nostalgia.maniowy.net/przesiedlenie This meant that eventually, the existing town of Maniowy would be underwater, so measures were taken to relocate the residents further up the slopes away from the water. Resettlement to the new Maniowy started as early as the 1970s,http://nostalgia.maniowy.net/przesiedlenie and the waters started to cover the old town in 1995.

It is in a coastal region of the Arctic Ocean which contains approximately 1,350 Arctic ice dome hills--approximately one quarter of the world's pingos. History The area has been a focus of scientific study for over 50 years, and research here has formed the basis of current understanding about the origin and growth of pingos. The region was first identified as a site of national significance in 1978, and landmark status was proposed. Legislation creating it in 1984 formed part of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement (officially, the Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act (1984)).Inuvialuit Final Agreement It provided for cooperative management of the Landmark between the Government of Canada, the Inuvialuit Land Administration, and the people of Tuktoyaktuk. It reserved subsurface rights for the Inuvialuit, federal jurisdiction for the surface, and that the pingos would be preserved unimpaired. Although a nationwide landmarks program was envisioned at its creation, Pingo remains the country's only National Landmark. Geography The Landmark comprises an area roughly , just west of Tuktoyaktuk, and includes Ibyuk Pingo‚ÄîCanada's highest, exceeded in height only by Kadleroshilik Pingo in Alaska‚Äîat . The Landmark, which lies within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, is managed by Parks Canada under the National Parks Act. In a region near the Beaufort Sea which is quite flat, pingos dominate the skyline, rising from , in various stages of growth and collapse. Ibyuk Pingo, the highest, continues to grow about per year, and is estimated to be at least 1,000 years old. Unique to areas of permafrost, pingos have formed here thanks to numerous lakes in the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula. Geology Ibyuk, the largest pingo in Canada and the second largest in the world after Kadleroshilik Pingo in Alaska =Pingos= The Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula has greatest concentration of pingos in the world with a total of 1,350 pingos. These pingos formed in one of two distinct ways: hydrostatically and hydraulically. =Other features= The Landmark protects an excellent example of massive ice. One section of the frozen groundwater, part of an eroded hillside by the sea, is over long, and high. Other less visible ice beds in the region are over thick. This type of ice is found in permafrost, and can be thousands of years old. The permafrost environment of the Landmark also hosts wedge ice. These are vertical masses of ice that form after water freezes in the cracks around ground that has contracted due to extreme cold. When ice wedges connect to one another, they can form tundra polygons. These polygons are most striking when viewed from the air. Ecology =Flora= =Fauna= Animals that inhabit this park include grizzly and polar bears, wolf packs, two species of fox, and Arctic ground squirrels. Birds that either nest or migrate around the park are brant geese, tundra swans, lesser snow geese, loons, and greater white-fronted geese. Ducks such as mallard, green- winged teal, king eider, common eider, and oldsquaw are common to this area as well as a variety of gulls and shorebird species. Visiting the Landmark In August 2010 a boardwalk trail was completed with a boat launch, dock and viewing platforms; interpretive signage is planned by Parks Canada for self- guided tours. Local tour operators provide guided access to the site, which is easiest by boat. Hiking provides a more challenging option, but no matter how visitors access the site, Arctic weather and varying water levels can force a change of plans and an alternate route of return. In media The landmark was featured in Billy Connolly: Journey to the Edge of the World, a 2008 transcontinental land, sea, and air journey by the Scottish entertainer.Billy Connolly: Journey to the Edge of the World, episode 3 (at approx. the 27:30 minute mark).

The film's script, written by Homero Manzi and Ulyses Petit de Murat, is based on the novel by Leopoldo Lugones published in 1905. The film premiered in Buenos Aires on November 20, 1942 and is considered by critics of Argentine cinema to be one of the most successful films in history.Di N√∫bila, Domingo, La √©poca de oro. Historia del cine argentino I p√°g. 392, 1998, Buenos Aires, Ediciones del Jilguero, It won three Silver Condor awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Lucas Demare), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ulises Petit de Murat and Homero Manzi), given by the Argentine Film Critics Association at the 1943 Argentine Film Critics Association Awards for the best films and performances of the previous year. The film is set in 1817 in the Salta Province of northwest Argentina during the Argentine War of Independence. It is based on the actions taken by the guerrillas under the command of the general Martin G√ºemes against the royalist army, loyal to the Spanish monarchy. For exterior filming, a village was established in the same area where the actual conflict had taken place. The cast of some thousand participants was unprecedented in Argentine cinema until that time. The origins and content of the film are linked to a particular moment in Argentine history in which there was an intense debate over whether the country should take the side of either the Axis or the Allies during World War II, or maintain its neutrality during the war. The film stresses the values associated with nationalism as expressed in the union of the people, the army, and the church in defense of the country, which was considered by some a prelude to the revolutionary ideology that led to, on June 4, 1943, the overthrowing of the government of president Ram√≥n Castillo. The film was produced by Artistas Argentinos Asociados (Associated Argentine Artists), a cooperative of artists created just a short time before production began. It required an investment far beyond other productions of the period but the commercial success of the film allowed it to recover the cost in the first-run theaters, where it remained for nineteen weeks.  Plot  In Salta Province in 1817 during the War of Independence, the irregular forces commanded by General Mart√≠n G√ºemes carry out a guerrilla action against the Spanish army. The commander of a Spanish army contingent, Lieutenant Villarreal, is wounded, captured by the guerrillas, and put under the medical care of Asunci√≥n, the mistress of an estancia. She finds out from his idenfication paper that the Lieutenant, though serving in the Spanish army, was born in Lima. She persuades him of the justice of liberating America from Spain. The patriot forces receive help from the sacristan of a chapel located next to the grounds of the royalist troops. The sacristan fakes loyalty to the king, but during the battles he sends messages to the gaucho guerrillas hiding in the mountains by means of a messenger boy and by ringing of the bell. When the royalists discover this, they attack and burn the chapel and smash the sacristan's eyes. Blinded, the sacristan unwittingly guides the royalists to the patriot camp. The royalists then proceed to annihilate the gauchos. In the final sequence, after the battle, the only three surviving characters (the badly injured sacristan, an old man, and the lieutenant who has fallen in love with Asunci√≥n and converted to the patriot cause) see G√ºemes' arriving troops, which will continue the battle. = Prologue = The film begins with a prologue on screen providing the historical circumstances of the place and time in which the action is placed, and advancing the position of its authors. From 1814 to 1818, G√ºemes and his gauchos resisted the royalist armies, that systematically ransacked the country from the Alto Peru since the withdrawal of the regular troops. This conflict of small battles was characterized by the heroism of the adversaries.

It is an epic story composed of several histories described with a wide vocabulary full of metaphors. Dialogs are short, but descriptions and subjective vision are plentiful. The landscape characteristics and Salta's nature are described in detail and have great importance in the book. =Historical context in Argentina = Francisco Petrone in a scene from the film On February 20, 1938 Roberto M. Ortiz became president of Argentina. A member of the Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical Antipersonalista party, he expressed his intention of ending the systemic electoral fraud imposed since the 1930 military coup. This idea found resistance within the political coalition named \\"The Concordance\\" (\\"La Concordancia\\") to which he belonged. Finally the worsening of his diabetes forced him to relinquish the presidency to his vice president Ram√≥n Castillo, first in provisionally and after June 27, 1942 permanently. The new president was not in agreement with Ortiz's policies and from his post he condoned the fraud practices, disappointing the followers who believed in the changes proposed by his predecessor. Halper√≠n Donghi, Tulio, La rep√∫blica imposible (1930-1945) p√°g. 236, 2004, Buenos Aires, Ariel Historia, At the start of World War II the Argentine government declared itself neutral (on September 4, 1939), repeating the position taken during the First World War (1914‚Äì1918). Great Britain supported the decision as it was interested in Argentina being neutral and continuing the supply of food during the war. Halper√≠n Donghi, Tulio, La rep√∫blica imposible (1930-1945) p√°g. 261, 2004, Buenos Aires, Ariel Historia, In December 1941, the United States of America declared war on the Axis powers after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In January 1942, the Third Consulting Meeting of Chancellors of the American Republics met in R√≠o de Janeiro as the U.S. wished other American nations to break relations with the Axis powers.

La Argentina frente a la Segunda Guerra Mundial p√°g. 11, 1988, Buenos Aires, Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires, was opposed to said goals and influenced successfully to \\"recommend\\" the breakup of relations instead of making it mandatory.

This latter minority group included the followers of nationalism and some officers of the army. The subject of the position the country should take on the war displaced other issues in the national political arena. Buchrucker, Cristian, Nacionalismo y peronismo p√°g. 222, 1987, Buenos Aires, Editorial Sudamericana, Starting in the 1930s, and following a general tendency in Latin America, nationalist ideas were fortified in the countryside and many diverse sectors of Argentina. Political parties such as the Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical, the Socialist Party of Argentina, and in the unions organized under the umbrella of the Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo the favorable currents for the State to become interventionist were growing, in order to push the preservation on the national interests and promote industrialization. This ideological change was also observable in the cultural movements, with the vindication of the tango and the indigenous \\"gaucho roots\\".

La guerra gaucha was then selected as the subject, written and filmed in the context of expansive nationalism and debates over issues of war. = State of the film industry in Argentina = In 1938, 41 films opened and 16 new directors debuted.

Homero Manzi had the idea since he wrote the script to the film \\"Viento Norte\\" (\\"North Wind\\") and convinced director Lucas Demare of the project's viability. Francisco Petrone proposed that the script be written by Manzi and Ulyses Petit de Murat. The rights for the movie were purchased from Leopoldo \\"Polo\\" Lugones (son of the writer) for 10,000 pesos received two jazz records that were unavailable in the country.

The company, knowing he was not in physical condition to survive the tough filming schedule and not wishing to replace him for another actor while he was alive, postponed the filming with an excuse and started to film El viejo Hucha (\\"Old Man Hucha\\"), in which he had no role. Remembering the proposal to write the screenplay, Ulyses Petit de Murat said: Due to having had spent all the budget needed for La guerra gaucha on El viejo Hucha, the partners at Artistas Argentinos Asociados decided to fund the film with their own fees. This financial effort was insufficient and they had to partner with San Miguel Studios and undersell the exhibition rights for the movie earlier in some areas. These decisions allowed them to make the film with \\"a little less belt-tightening but without splurging\\". Zolezzi, Emilio, Noticias del viejo cine criollo, p√°g.70, 2006, Buenos Aires, Ediciones Lumiere S.A., = Script =  Homero Manzi  Homero Manzi Homero Manzi was born November first of 1907 in A√±atuya (province of Santiago del Estero), Argentina. He was interested in literature and tango since he was young. After a brief incursion in journalism, Manzi worked as a literature and castilian professor but for political reasons (in addition to his membership in the Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical) he was expelled of his professorship and decided to dedicate himself to the arts. In 1935 he participated on the beginnings of FORJA (Fuerza de Orientaci√≥n Radical de la Joven Argentina ‚Äì Force of Radical Orientation of the Young Argentina), a group whose position has been classified as ‚Äúpeoples nationalism‚Äù. It was centered in the problematic Argentina and Latin America and on its discussions suggested ‚Äúreconquer the political Sunday from our own land‚Äù since it considered the country was still under a colonial situation. It supported neutrality in WWII on the premise that was no great interest was in play in Argentina or Latin America, it was more of a rejection position towards fascism just as much as communism. Buchrucker, Cristian, Nacionalismo y peronismo p√°g. 258 y 269, 1987, Buenos Aires. Editorial Sudamericana, In 1934, Manzi founded Micr√≥fono (\\"Microphone\\") magazine which covered subjects related to radiotelephony, Argentine movies and film making. He wrote the screenplay for Nobleza Gaucha in 1937 in collaboration with Hugo Mac Dougall, and a remake of Huella (\\"Footprint\\") (1940), for which they received second prize from Buenos Aires City Hall and also Confesi√≥n (\\"Confession\\") (1940), without achieving commercial success with any of these movies. Salas, Horacio, Homero Manzi y su tiempo p√°g. 198, 2001, Buenos Aires, Javier Vergara editor, In 1940 Manzi started what would be a long collaboration with Ulyses Petit de Murat, writing the screenplay for Con el dedo en el gatillo (\\"Finger on the trigger\\") (1940) and later Fort√≠n alto (\\"High Fort\\") (1940).  Ulyses Petit de Murat  Ulyses Petit de Murat was born in Buenos Aires on January 28, 1907 and was interested in literature and journalism from a young age. He was in charge of the music page in the daily magazine Cr√≠tica and, with Jorge Luis Borges, co-directed its literary supplement.Ulyses Petit de Murat. In 1932 he moved to the motion film section of Cr√≠tica and in 1939 wrote his first cinematographic script for the movie Prisioneros de la Tierra, an adaptation of four tales of Horacio Quiroga, made with his son, Dario Quiroga, who later in 1940 wrote Con el Dedo en el Gatillo, with the collaboration of Homero Manzi. The screenwriters started by selecting the stories that would provide them with the elements for the work. Dianas was chosen as the main source, some characters were taken from Alertas and some from other stories. They compiled the words, traditions, life styles and idioms from that era for which they used books and even a trip was made to Salta to talk with the locals. A script Then a text was made from the tales and a first draft of the images. At this point the director and actors collaborated with their comments and finally the final script was written. Guillermo Corti, cit. por Salas, Horacio, Homero Manzi y su tiempo p√°g. 205, 2001, Buenos Aires, Javier Vergara editor, = Direction= Born July 14, 1907 Demare was a music scholar. In 1928, he traveled to Spain as a bandone√≥n player for the Orchestra T√≠pica Argentina, where his brother Lucio also played. In 1933 he worked as an interpreter and singer for Spanish movies Boliche and Aves sin rumbo. Lucas Demare Demare quit the orchestra and started working in the film industry; he quickly rose from chalkboard holder to director assistant. Some time later he was hired to debut as a director, but the civil war broke out and he returned to Buenos Aires. Maranghello, C√©sar, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires p√°g. 29, Ediciones del Jilguero, Emilio Zolezzi, aside from being a movie critic, was also the Artistas Argentinas Associados attorney. He tells about the director: When he returned to Spain, his brother Lucio got him a job as custodian in the Rio de la Plata cinematographic studios. In 1937, he was hired as director and screenwriter for the movies Dos amigos y un amor (Two friends and one love) and Veinticuatro horas de libertad (Twenty-four hours of liberty), both starring comedy actor Pepe Iglesias. In 1939, he directed El hijo del barrio (1940, Son of the neighborhood), Coraz√≥n the Turco (1940, Turkish Heart) and Chingolo (1941) all of them with their own script. Maranghello, C√©sar, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires p√°g. 30, Ediciones del Jilguero, This movie was well received by the public and critics, ‚ÄúIt consolidated the exceptional tech team accompanied by Artistas Argentinos Asociados: his brother Lucio on the music band, the assistant Hugo Fregones, the montajussta Carlos Rinaldi, the set builder Ralph Pappier, the lighting specialist from the United States Bob Roberts (from the American Society of Cinematographers), the cinematographer Humberto Peruzzi, the electrician Seraf√≠n de la Iglesia, the make up artist Roberto Combi and some others.‚Äù The following movie was El cura gaucho, in which he met Enrique Muri√±o, but even with his abundant commercial success, he was fired from Pampa Films. = Filming = Lucas Demare thought that January and February (summer) were the best months to work on the filming in Salta but they were told that it was better to do it in winter due to summer being flood season. Demare travelled to Salta to reconnoiter the area. Later, the crew and equipment moved to an old estate and big house. They worked on a big ballroom and had two small rooms; each crewman had a cot and an upside down beer wooden box as night-stand. The actresses and Enrique Mui√±o, due to his age, stayed in a hotel. Demare, Lucas, C√≥mo se film√≥ La guerra gaucha, p√°g. 132, en Cuentos de cine (Sergio Ren√°n, sel.), 1996, Buenos Aires, Alfaguara, Enrique Mui√±o At their arrival in Salta, they met with the local military commander, Colonel Lan√∫s, but he was not eager to help, instead placing obstacles in their way. Demare told how they solved the problem: Demare had brought gaucho clothing for the cast, but he realized they were not appropriate for the feel he wanted in the movie as they were brand-new, so he traded the new clothing for local gauchos' own clothing. Ardiles Gray, Julio, Lucas Demare: mi vida en el cine, en diario Convicci√≥n, Buenos Aires, 10 de agosto de 1980, Suplemento Letras n* 106, III Demare sent Maga√±a and Chiola on long horse rides to \\"weather\\" their uniforms and accustom the actors to riding. The locals were surprised to encounter two soldiers in antiquated uniforms. Lucas Demare shows up in the film as an extra a few times. The scene in which the town burns had to be done in one take as they could not afford to rebuild it. Demare had the cameramen and the rest of the crew dressed as gauchos or royalist troops so that if they were accidentally included, they would not ruin the shot. While directing this scene, a sudden wind change moved the fire towards Demare himself making him lose his wig and singeing his fake beard and mustache. In another scene, Demare played the part of a Spanish soldier who, being attacked by the gauchos, receives a lance hit through the chest. Maga√±a tells In another scene where the characters played by Amelia Bence, Petrone and Maga√±a argue, the latter was supposed to fall down the stairs but doubted his ability to do so. Demare stood at the top of the stairs with his back to it and rolled down, to demonstrate that the scene could be done without undue risk. This was in fact the sequence shown in the movie. Maranghello, C√©sar, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires p√°g. 62, Ediciones del Jilguero, A scene where a group of horses ran down a hill with burning branches tied to their tails needed to be filmed from in front, so the crew built a hut made of wood, stones, and rocks in which stood Peruzzi the cameraman, who tells that \\"At the order of Action! I saw this mass of heads and hooves coming at me at full speed, and did not breath until I saw them open up to the sides of the hut, right in front of me. We had to improvise and replace the lack of technology with smarts, ingenuity and valor.\\" The filming included more than 1,000 actors as extras for the crowd scenes, although only eighty actors had speaking parts. Pappier, Ralph, Un anticipo de La guerra gaucha, en revista Cine argentino, Buenos Aires, 19 de noviembre de 1942, n* 237 Among the extras there were local gauchos hired by the producers and others provided as laborers by their employer, the Patr√≥n Costa, a wealthy local family. Maranghello, C√©sar, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires p√°g. 57, Ediciones del Jilguero, There were also the aforementioned fencing trainer and soldiers lent by the military garrison and two pato players from Buenos Aires, experts falling from horses. As the gauchos did not want to be dressed as Spaniards, military conscripts played the part. Maranghello, C√©sar, Artistas Argentinos Asociados. La epopeya trunca, 2002, Buenos Aires p√°g. 53, Ediciones del Jilguero, = Location = For the scenes in the local village where the royalists had established their headquarters, they selected the village of San Fernando. Nearby is the Gallinato Creek, where they filmed the gaucho encampment scenes and the assault against Miranda's woman. They brought material from Salta in fifty trucks to build a village. It had an area of about a thousand square meters, fifteen houses, a church with a belfry, hospital, horse barn, corrals, commander's office, cemetery, and ovens, all of which was destroyed by the fire in the final scenes. The director requested five hundred horses, four hundred cattle, oxen, mules, burros and chickens. Also many props such as wheelbarrows, wagons, and period-military equipment. Sebasti√°n Chiola y Amelia Bence The interior and exterior scens of the Asunci√≥n ranch, the royalist encampment at night, the interior of the church and belfry, the death of the child and the musical number by the √Åbalos Brothers group were filmed at the studios in Buenos Aires.  Soundtrack and choreography The music score was done by Lucio Demare. Born in Buenos Aires on 9 August 1906, he studied music from the age of six and from the age of eight he was playing piano in movie theatres -it was still the age of silent movies. In Spain in 1933, he created the music for two movies in which he also acted. He started his work in Argentine cinema in 1936 with the musical score for the film Ya tiene comisario el pueblo (\\"The village now has a constable\\"), directed by Claudio Mart√≠nez Payva Di N√∫bila, Domingo, La √©poca de oro. Historia del cine argentino I, p√°g. 142, 1998, Buenos Aires, Ediciones del Jilguero, and in 1938, he continued with Dos amigos y un amor (\\"two friends and one love\\"), with Francisco Canaro, and directed by his brother Lucas Demare. The musical numbers and native dances were played by the √Åbalos Brothers group.  Reception  La guerra gaucha was well received by the critics and the public and received several awards. The article in the El Heraldo de Buenos Aires said: La Guerra Gaucha program La Naci√≥n said: Claudio Espa√±a wrote: The opinion of film critic Jos√© Agust√≠n Mahieu is as follows: Lastly, C√©sar Maranghello says: The film stayed on the opening theaters for nineteen weeks where it was seen by 170,000 viewers, including four weeks in Montevideo by that time.  Awards  La guerra gaucha received the following awards: *The Silver Condor for Best Picture, Best Director (L. Demare), and Best Screenplay (Ulyses Petit de Murat y Homero Manzi) from the Argentine Film Critics Association *The Condor Diploma for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay (Petit de Murat and Manzi), Main Actor (Francisco Petrone), Best Sound Editing and Best Cinematography from the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences *Best Screenplay (Petit de Murat and Manzi) from the Comisi√≥n Nacional de Cultura *First prize for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Lead Actress (Amelia Bence), Best Actor (Francisco Petrone), Best Photography, Best Music and Best Sound Editing from Municipalidad de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires *Best Foreign film in Cuba shown in 1947 from the Asociaci√≥n de Cronistas Cinematogr√°ficos de La Habana (Cuba / 1948)  Economic aspects  Filming delays meant that the producers spent part of the monies they had earned on the film El Viejo Hucha. To recoup this, they had to undersell the exhibition rights in advance in some areas. Spending as little as possible, the production ended up costing 269,000 pesos approximately 55,000 US dollars. The extras in Salta were paid between 3 and 4 pesos per workday, when a theater seat cost 3 pesos. Amelia Bence was paid 5,000 pesos for about six days of filming. This was completely recouped in the nineteen weeks the film stayed at the opening theaters. Zolezzi, Emilio, Noticias del viejo cine criollo, p√°g.71, 2006, Buenos Aires, Ediciones Lumiere S.A., Nonetheless, due to the partners' lack of business experience and their scant resources put into starting the business, critical and public acclaim did not translate into big earnings.

The town was also founded near the site of Sulpher Spring, which because of the town became renowned for its healing powers. The site was also the grave of the daughter of Young Elk, an elder of the Omaha Tribe who advised Logan Fontenelle.

This type of speculation relied on money from wildcat banks, which were shady investment schemes popular at the time. Beadle named the community after his own hometown of Saratoga, New York because the mineral springs are similar to Saratoga Springs, New York. It was hoped these springs would draw many visitors to the area, and anticipating that, a large hotel (the Saratoga Springs) was built. Within several months the town had more than 50 buildings, including several businesses and churches. In February 1857 the Nebraska Territory Legislature passed an act incorporating the first University of Nebraska at Saratoga. When that did not transpire, the University was newly incorporated in Lincoln.(1857) Laws, joint resolutions, and memorials passed at the regular session of the General Assembly of the Territory of Nebraska.

OBPs are characterized by a specific protein domain that comprises six Œ±-helices joined by three disulfide bonds. Although the function of the OBPs as a whole is not well established, it is believed that they act as odorant transporters, delivering the odorant molecules to olfactory receptors in the cell membrane of sensory neurons. The olfactory receptors of terrestrial animals exist in an aqueous environment, yet detect odorants that are primarily hydrophobic. The aqueous solubility of hydrophobic odorants is greatly enhanced via odorant-binding proteins, which exist in the extracellular fluid surrounding the odorant receptors. This family is composed of pheromone binding proteins (PBP), which are male-specific and associate with pheromone-sensitive neurons and general-odorant-binding proteins (GOBP). These proteins were initially identified on the basis of their ability to bind with moderate-affinity radioactively labeled odorants.  Structure  OBPs are small proteins on the order of 14 kDa in size. All odorant binding proteins are believed to have a common structure despite their genetic diversity and highly variable primary structures. In vertebrates, OBPs are a part of the lipocalin family. They are structurally characterized by a Œ≤-barrel motif composed of antiparallel Œ≤-sheets. Insect OBPs share very little amino acid sequence similarity to vertebrate OBPs as they mainly contain Œ±-helical domains. OBPs are divergent across and within species. The percentage of conserved residues between species has been shown to be as low as 8%. OBPs' have a characteristic signature that is recognized by a conserved pattern of six cysteines that are connected in the protein by three disulfide bridges. Their structures have been investigated to explore new bio-inspired repellents against mosquitoes, with potentially improved OBP binding affinity, selectivity, and reduced volatility.  Function  The functions of odorant binding proteins as a whole is not well understood. They are generally believed to increase the solubility of hydrophobic odorants by binding them and transporting them across the aqueous sensillum lymph to receptors in the dendrites, and several studies support a role for OBPs in olfactory perception in vivo. Some odorant binding proteins are hypothesized to hasten odor response termination by extracting odorant molecules from the sensillar lymph or from receptors themselves. Presently, just one OBP, Obp76a, has been thoroughly investigated in the olfactory system of Drosophila and has a known physiological role. Obp76a, better known as LUSH, is located trichoid sensilla and is necessary for normal response of the odor receptor Or67d to its pheromone ligand cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), although responses of Or67d to cVA have been detected in the absence of Obp76a LUSH has also been found to bind cVA in vitro and is known to bind other insect pheromones, short-chain alcohols, and phthalates. In 2016, Larter et al. found that the deletion of the sole abundant OBP, Obp28a, in ab8 sensilla of Drosophila does not reduce the magnitude of their olfactory responses, suggesting that Obp28a is not required for odorant transport and that ab8 sensilla do not require an abundant OBP. Their results further suggest Obp28a may be buffering changes in the odor environment, possibly as molecular gain control, which has not been previously reported for OBPs. OBPs are thought to have multiple roles besides olfaction, including reproduction, egg laying and antiinflammatory responses.  Expression  OBPs are numerous and diverse. In Drosophila, they are encoded by 52 genes of the same family yet only share 20% amino acid similarity between themselves. Some are encoded by the most abundant mRNAs of the antennae. Within and between species, OBPs are expressed in several different tissues, including the antennal sensilla, the taste system, and chemosensory organs. They are also known to be ectopically expressed in tissues such as the gut. Genomic analysis of Drosophila and other insect species (Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori, and Triboliumcastaneum) has revealed that the OBP genes significantly differ between species. The OBP family contains 21 (in A. mellifera) to 66 genes (in A. gambiae), whereas it ranges from 52 members in Drosophila to 20 in T. castaneum. Generally these genes are irregularly scattered across the genome. Most (69% of the OBP genes in Drosophila) are arranged in small clusters from 2 to 6 OBP genes. The Drosophila OBP gene family has been classified into several subfamilies based on structural features, functional information, and phylogenetic relationships: the Classic, Minus-C, Plus-C, Dimer, PBP/GOBP, ABPI and ABPII, CRLBP, and D7 subfamilies. These subfamilies are unequally distributed across arthropods, even among the dipterans and are totally absent in some species.

Active duty in the Australian army during World War 2 saw Gus serving in the pacific. Here he painted panels for a recreation tent for wounded Australian and allied soldiers- the work now resides at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. As part of the Occupation forces in 1946, Gus travelled to Japan to teach art to the Japanese and there he met and was interviewed by a young cartoonist, named Les Tanner who worked for BECON ( British and Allied Forces Newspaper). The friendship endured for the next fifty years, until Les Tanner's death in 2001. After the war, Gus returned to Sydney where he worked as a cartoonist and illustrator for the Daily Telegraph and Women's Weekly before moving home to Melbourne where he worked on The Argus newspaper, as the cartoonist \\"Just Gus\\". He began potting with Reg Preston in 1955 and was one of the founding members in 1958 of the Potters Cottage in Warrandyte, Victoria. He and his wife Betty McLaren, set up Yarraridge pottery and together and separately, the two produced an extensive body of work. This included wheel-thrown and hand- built pieces, as well as a range of slip-cast figures designed by Gus and decorated by Betty. These designs are still being used by Betty to make figures for sale from her McLaren Pottery on the New South Wales south coast. Gus McLaren has ceramic works in both public and private collections. When the Potters Cottage held its 45th anniversary in 2003, he participated in the exhibition. He also has a considerable body of work in animated films. In 1962 he directed the first animation series made for Australian television, Freddo the Frog and he was one of the animators who worked on Grendel, Grendel, Grendel, a full-length animated film retelling the Beowulf epic released in 1981.

A failed detective writer, Howard Spitz has hit rock bottom until an 8-year- old girl helps him write children's books. Plot Howard Spitz is the author behind a string of poorly selling detective novels. He discovers that in contrast children's books enjoy strong sales. Believing it an easy way to make money, Spitz becomes a children's author with his new book character, a bovine detective named \\"Crafty Cow\\", but finds writing for his new audience significantly difficult. Whilst doing research at the local library, he submits his drafts to a little girl called Samantha Kershaw who polishes them up. In return, she asks Spitz to find her father who left her mother before she was born. Spitz also discovers that to become a successful children's author he will need to do public appearances with his audience. Terrified at the prospect of having to spend time with children, Spitz hires a struggling actor to serve as his public face. But soon his doppelg√§nger is having delusions of grandeur, as his book becomes more and more successful.

They are 1235 km across and centered at 11.28 ¬∞N and 166.37 ¬∞E. Their northernmost latitude is 16.16 ¬∞N and their southernmost latitude 6.23 ¬∞N. Their easternmost and westernmost longitudes are 174.72 ¬∞E and 154.43 ¬∞E, respectively. They can be seen in the Elysium quadrangle. Ripples seen at the bottom of the faults are sand blown by the wind. Numerical modeling of the forces in the crust of Mars suggest that the underlying cause for the faulting is the deformation caused by the Tharsis volcanoes to the east. The faults are quite young, cutting through pre-existing features such as the hills of the Tartarus Montes and the lava apron southeast of Elysium Mons. The formation of the fossae was suspected to have released pressurized underground water, previously confined by the cryosphere, with flow rates up to 2 √ó 106 m3s‚àí1, leading to the creation of the Athabasca Valles.Cabrol, N. and E.

Marte Vallis is another channel that was suggested to have formed from water released from Cerberus Fossae.Gareth, A. B. Campbell, L. Carter, J. Plaut, R. Phillips. 2013. 3D Reconstruction of the Source and Scale of Buried Young Flood Channels on Mars. Science, March 7, DOI:10.1126/Science.1234787 Crater counts suggest this last outflow from the Cerberus Fossae took place about 2 to 10 million years ago. There has been a suggestion such high discharges of water to the surface through these fissures are physically implausible and that lava was the fluid erupted from the Cerberus Fossae. The flood of lava would have had a volume of about 5000 cubic kilometers, quite typical of flood basalt eruptions on Earth. At these high discharges, lava behaved in many ways like a flood of water. It appears to have modestly eroded parts of the Athabasca Valles and then filled the Cerberus Palus basin. The rafted plates of lava in this by temporary lava pond are remarkably similar in appearance to pack ice seen in the North Sea. While some of the cracks are situated at the top of a topographic rise and are surrounded by flow features, indicating they served as volcanic vents, others are on completely flat terrain without flow features, indicating they are simply fractures. The Cerberus Fossae area has been positively identified as the first tectonically active region on Mars, with marsquakes being geolocated there by seismometer measurements from the NASA InSight lander in 2019; this activity was previously suspected on the basis of the trails of dislodged boulders.

Its precise nature has been difficult to reconstruct from the diverse literary sources and evidence derived from vase painting. The earliest reference to the komos is in Hesiod's Shield of Herakles, which indicates it took place as part of wedding festivities (line 281). And famously Alcibiades gate-crashes the Symposium while carousing in a komos. However, no one kind of event is associated with the komos: Pindar describes them taking place at the city festivals (Pythian 5.21, 8.20, Olympian 4.9), while Demosthenes mentions them taking place after the 'pompe' and choregoi on the first day of the Greater Dionysia (Speeches 21.10), which may indicate the komos might have been a competitive event. The komos must be distinguished from the pompe, or ritual procession, and the chorus, both of which were scripted. The komos lacked a chorus leader, script, or rehearsal.Rothwell, p8 In the performance of Greek victory odes (epinikia) at post-Game celebrations for winning athletes, the choral singers often present themselves as komasts, or extend an invitation to join the komos, as if the formal song were a preliminary to spontaneous revelry.Simon Goldhill, The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 135 online. Nevertheless some komoi were expressly described as \\"semno√≠\\" (\\"modest\\", \\"decent\\"), which implies that standard komoi were anything but. Demosthenes upbraids the brother-in-law of Aeschines for not wearing a mask during the komos, as was the custom (On the Embassy 19.287),Rothwell maintains there is some ambiguity to this, see note 7 p.214 suggesting costume or disguise may have been involved. The playing of music during the komos is also mentioned by Aristophanes (Thesmophoriazusae 104, 988) and Pindar (Olympian 4.9, Pythian 5.22). There are also depictions of torch-lit processions in vase painting, yet it is not always clear from the evidence of vases if they depict symposia, choruses or komoi. It is now widely thought that komos and Œ∫œâŒº·ø≥Œ¥ŒØŒ± - komoidia \\"comedy\\" are etymologically related, the derivation being komos + ·æ†Œ¥ŒÆ - o(i)de \\"song\\" (from ·ºÄŒµŒØŒ¥œâ - aeido \\"sing\\"). However, in part III of the Poetics, Aristotle records the tradition that the word komoedia derives from the Megaran mime that took place in the villages of Sicily, hence from Œ∫œéŒºŒ∑ - kome (the Dorian word for villageThe SOED cites both etymologies.). Nevertheless, it remains unclear exactly how the revel-song developed into the Greek Old comedy of the Dionysian festival in the 6th century BCE.

At the beginning of each second (with the exception of the 59th), the carrier signal was interrupted for a period of 0.1 s or 0.2 s, which corresponded to a binary \\"0\\" or \\"1\\". The transmission of the minute, hour, calendar date, day of the week, month and current year was achieved by means of a BCD code identical to that of DCF77. Like DCF77, the carrier was not interrupted during the last second of each minute. Differences from the DCF77 time code: * The carrier frequency. * Phase modulation was not included. * Amplitude modulation was done by disabling the transmitter (0% amplitude) rather than reducing it to 15% amplitude as DCF77 does. * Announcement bits warning of impending time zone changes or leap seconds were sent 12 hours in advance, rather than 1 hour. * The first pulse of each minute was not a standard 0 bit as DCF77 sends. Instead, it was a double pulse, two 0.1 s interruptions separated by 0.1 s of carrier. A triple pulse signalled the start of a new hour, and a four-pulse signal was transmitted at noon and midnight. It is understood that this frequency is now available in Europe, as well as any other part of the world, for time signal dissemination.

Fiske is also a media critic, examining how cultural meaning is created in American society, and how debates over issues such as race are handled in different media.  Career  Fiske was educated in Britain. After graduating from Cambridge University, he taught throughout the world including Australia, New Zealand and the US. While living in Perth, Australia, during the 1980s and early 1990s, he was the general editor of the academic journal Cultural Studies and taught at Western Australian Institute of Technology (known as Curtin University as of 1986). He was a Professor of Communication Arts at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for 12 years. He has since retired from academia. = Honors = In 2000, Fiske was granted emeritus status by University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as a Professor of Letters and Science/Communication Arts after having taught at the University for 12 years.\\"Faculty and academic staff granted emeritus/emerita status in 2000-01.\\" UWMadison News. University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. 2000 August 29. In May 2008, Fiske received an Honorary Degree from the University of Antwerp.  Theory  = Semiotics and television studies = Fiske is considered one of the first scholars applying semiotics to media texts following the tradition of poststructuralism, and coined the term semiotic democracy. He is the author of works on television studies regarding popular culture and mass media. Fiske's books analyze television shows as \\"texts\\" in order to examine the different layers of meaning and sociocultural content. Fiske rejects the notion that assumes \\"the audience\\" as an uncritical mass, the theory that mass audiences consume the products that are offered to them without thought. He instead suggests \\"audiences\\" as being of various social backgrounds and identities that enable them to receive texts differently. Fiske's 1987 textbook on television, Television Culture, introduces the subject of television studies by examining the economic and cultural issues, as well as the theory and text- based criticism, involving television. It also provides an overview of the arguments by British, American, Australian, and French scholars. It was \\"one of the first books about television to take seriously the feminist agenda that has been so important to the recent development of the field.\\"\\"Television studies.\\" Museum of Broadcast Communications. 2013. = Power = In Power Plays, Power Works (1993), Fiske argues that power ‚Äúis a systematic set of operations upon people that works to ensure the maintenance of the social order‚Ä¶and ensure its smooth running.‚ÄùFiske, John. 1993. Power Plays, Power Works. . p. 11. Through the book, Fiske coined the term power bloc in reference to the social and political economic constructs around which power functions in the contemporary Western world.Kincheloe, Joe L. 2008. \\"Questions of Power and Knowledge. In Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy.\\" Ch. 5 in Explorations of Educational Purpose 1, edited by J. L. Kincheloe. . p. 97. Rather than constituting a particular class or permanently-defined socio- political group, power blocs are unsystematic series of both strategic and tactical political alliances. These constantly-changing partnerships form whenever circumstances emerge that jeopardize the socio-political advantages of the members involved. They therefore arise and separate on an ad hoc basis (i.e., depending on the necessities of the moment), and their alliance is specific to matters of social, cultural, historic, and/or imminent relevance. Those who fall outside of the bloc‚Äîand fall under its \\"authority\\"‚Äîcan be understood as the notion of \\"the people.\\" Such people may still possess power of their own, however it is a weaker power: what Fiske refers to as a localizing power. In Understanding Popular Culture (1989), Fiske maintains that culture is integral to social power:Fiske, John. 1989. Understanding Popular Culture.

Description and characteristics  These are generally small sea stars, flattened dorsally and bearing very short arms, often giving a pentagonal shape in the body (except in some species possessing more than five arms). The periphery of the body is thin and formed by indistinct, tiny marginal plates. They are characterized by their aborale face formed by plates shaped like crescents, sometimes giving a \\"knitted\\" appearance to the skin. The abyssal species can be bigger, like those of the genus Anseropoda, which can exceed 45 cm in diameter.  Biology  Most of the species are small and relatively cryptic: they are often found hidden under rocks or in crevices, for example. Several species have access to a fissiparous asexual reproduction, multiplying their reproductive potential. For that reason, some species of the genera Meridiastra and Aquilonastra can sometimes appear spontaneously in aquariums, where they can proliferate from just one larva imported inadvertently. Some species can brood their young (which thus do not pass through a planctonic larval stage), such as Asterina panceri. Most of the species feed on food fragments and algal or bacterial mat covering the substratum, evaginating their stomach on their food (a frequent feeding mode in sea stars). However, some species like Stegnaster inflatus takes advantage of their webbed shape to form a \\"trap\\" by heightening on the tip of their arms, and suddenly falling on a prey which would have believed to find shelter there. They can be found in almost all the seas of the world, from the abysses to the surface and from the poles to the tropics. Genera This family comprises about 21 genera and 116 species according to O'Loughlin & Waters (2004), whereas the World Asteroidea Database states that it includes 150 species in 25 genera.

Among the primary political targets of the party was a reform of the Asturian Statute of Autonomy, in which Asturias would be recognised as a Historical Nationality, the Asturian language would be granted official status (together with Spanish language), a statute that would guarantee the highest self-government possibilities recognized in the Spanish Constitution of 1978. In 1988 the party held its first National Conference, where the founding program is approved. The PAS decides then to take part in that year's regional elections, which finally placed the Part√≠u Asturianista as the fifth political power of Asturias. The PAS also ran for the European Parliament elections of 1989, being included in a coalition of nationalist parties from all Spain. During the first National Congress of 1991 the party approves the Documentu d'Ideolox√≠a y Estratexa (Document of Ideology and Political Strategy) and decides to form an electoral coalition with UNA, another Asturian nationalist party. In the elections of the 25 May 1991, PAS won one seat for S√°nchez Vicente in the Asturian Parliament and five seats in five different municipalities. This was the first time an Asturian nationalist party got a member in the Parliament since the transition to democracy. A seat in the Parliament was obtained again in the elections of 1995, when the PAS also won the Mayor elections in Nava. Old house of the party in Gij√≥n Part√≠u Asturianista supported the Sergio Marqu√©s Government of the Principality of Asturias from 1997 to 1999. As a result of this cooperation the Llei d'Usu y Promoci√≥n de l'Asturianu (Law of Promotion and Use of Asturian language) was approved, a law considered to be a prerequisite towards the future official status of Asturian and one of the biggest achievements in the history of the party. During the 2nd and 3rd National Congresses, held in 1994 and 1998 respectively, the party approves important documents like the Ponencia d'Empobinamientu Pol√≠ticu (Report on Political Guideline) and other future political strategies. Present PAS has been out of the Asturian Parliament from 1999. The organization took part in the regional elections of 2007 in coalition with URAS, both forming the Uni√≥n Asturianista (Asturianist Union), and currently the coalition has several mayors in various Asturian municipalities.

She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Coventry, the Lord Keeper, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1583‚Äì1653), daughter of John Aldersey of Spurstow, Cheshire, and widow of William Pitchford. Career She married Sir John Pakington, 2nd Baronet (1621‚Äì1680), of Westwood, Worcestershire. The couple had at least three surviving children: one son and two daughters. A fervent royalist, Dorothy Pakington wrote manuscript prayers, and shared in the circulation of religious and philosophical manuscripts in the group of clergymen around the king's chaplain, Henry Hammond. The extent of her reputation is shown by the fact that contemporaries believed her the author of The Whole Duty of Man. Although George Ballard defended this attribution, modern scholars instead follow two nineteenth-century writers ‚Äî Richard Barham and C. E.

He was a disc jockey on Radio Caroline. He was the son of the writer Oliver W F Lodge and his wife Diana, and a grandson of the physicist Sir Oliver Lodge. He was born on 16 April 1936, in Tanleather Cottage, Forest Green, Surrey. When World War II broke out, his family left England. He was brought up in Maryland and Virginia. At the end of the war he returned with his family to England and lived near Painswick, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Bedales School, England, where he developed his interest in music. He took lessons on the violin and the clarinet, taught himself the guitar and mouth organ, and played the stand up bass in a four piece skiffle band, called the \\"Top Flat Ramblers\\". When Lodge was eighteen, he travelled to Hay River, Northwest Territories and worked in commercial fishing on the Great Slave Lake. While fishing with a colleague, he was blown out into open waters on an ice floe. His companion died, but Lodge was rescued by some trappers. He described his adventures in his first book, Beyond the Great Slave Lake (published by Cassells in 1957 and E.P. Dutton in 1958). In 1956 he returned to England. He married Jeanine Arpourettes in 1957. They returned to Hay River, Canada, where he ran a fishing business. They had three sons: Tom Jr. (b. 1959, Yellowknife, North West Territories, Canada), Brodie (b. 1961, London, England), and Lionel (b. 1962, Inverness, Scotland). All three sons are involved in music, being significantly influenced and educated by Tom Sr., Tom Jr is in his eleventh year of a weekly Sunday (9-11 p.m. U.K. time) music show (originating as 'the two Toms' with Tom Sr.) which Tom Jr uploads from Canada to Radio Caroline in the U.K., www.radiocaroline.co.uk . Radio Caroline turned fifty, March 2014, Tom also has 3 grandchildren, and 3 great- grandchildren. Broadcasting In the late 1950s Lodge moved to Yellowknife, where he worked in a goldmine until he joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as an announcer on CFYK. On 27 May 1959, a son, Tom Lodge Jr. was born. Tom Jr. is currently a presenter on Radio Caroline.Radio Caroline Profiles (retrieved 21 February 2011) In 1960 Lodge became the CBC manager for a new radio station CBXH in Fort Smith, N.W.T., until he returned to England as a CBC correspondent. In 1964 Lodge joined England's first offshore pirate radio station Radio Caroline, as disc jockey and programme director. His book The Ship that Rocked the World describes his time there. The motion picture \\"Pirate Radio\\" is based on the novel. After the outlawing of the pirate radio ships in 1967 by the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, he worked as a disc jockey for the BBC's newly created Radio 1. In 1968 Lodge became a disc jockey on CHLO-AM, St Thomas, Ontario, Canada, where he continued to build his reputation for breaking new music. In 1973 he founded a creative program at Fanshawe College London, Ontario, Canada, called \\"Creative Electronics\\", which after three years he made into Music Industry Arts, a training program for recording engineers and record producers, and is still operating at Fanshawe College. Tom Sr although resigned from radio, continued to contribute to his son Tom Jr's weekly radio Caroline show when he was able, also he did 2 last shows for his beloved Radio Caroline, one being his personal history of Radio Caroline and the music that was integral to it, the other being a close look at the history and importance of the lead guitar, playing the lead guitar solos that changed rock n roll. Both shows are still available in the Caroline web shop. Umi In 1975, in California, Lodge began practising Zen. In January 1998 his Master changed his name to Umi and he began guiding people in Zen. He had a zendo, \\"Stillpoint Zen Community\\", near Santa Cruz, California. Bibliography *Beyond the Great Slave Lake, (Cassells, 1958) *Beyond the Great Slave Lake, (E.P.

Of possible Armenian origin, Heraclius the Elder distinguished himself in the war against the Sassanid Persians in the 580s. As a subordinate general (or hypostrategos), Heraclius served under the command of Philippicus during the Battle of Solachon and possibly served under Comentiolus during the Battle of Sisarbanon. In circa 595, Heraclius the Elder is mentioned as a magister militum per Armeniam sent by Emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602) to quell an Armenian rebellion led by Samuel Vahewuni and Atat Khorkhoruni. In circa 600, he was appointed as the Exarch of Africa and in 608, Heraclius the Elder rebelled with his son against the usurper Phocas (r. 602‚Äì610). Using North Africa as a base, the younger Heraclius managed to overthrow Phocas, beginning the Heraclian dynasty, which would rule Byzantium for a century. Heraclius the Elder died soon after receiving news of his son's accession to the Byzantine throne. Origin Heraclius the Elder was possibly of Armenian origin and presumably bilingual (Armenian and Greek) at an early age.; . His Armenian origin is deduced by a passage of Theophylact Simocatta, which considers him a native of Byzantine Armenia..The passage is from Book III of Theophylact Simocatta's history: \\"And so Philippicus had learned during his journey that Priscus had been accredited as general by the emperor (Maurice); on reaching Tarsus he composed messages to Heraclius the Elder which indicated that, after leaving the army, he should return to his own city when he came to Armenia, and surrender the army to Narses, the commander of the city of Constantina.\\" () Anthony Kaldellis argues that \\"there is not a single primary source that says that Heraclius was an Armenian\\" and that the assertion is based on an erroneous reading of Theophylact Simocatta. In a letter, Priscus, a general who had replaced Heraclius the Elder, wrote to him \\"to leave the army and return to his own city in Armenia\\". Kaldellis interprets it as the command headquarters of Heraclius the Elder, and not his home town.Kaldellis, Anthony (2019). Romanland: Ethnicity and Empire in Byzantium, p.183, Harvard University Press. . Heraclius the Elder's own city is not specifically mentioned. Mary and Michael Whitby suggest that Heraclius the Elder was at the time the magister militum per Armeniam. If so, \\"his city\\" was Theodosiopolis (modern Erzurum), the headquarters of the Roman forces in Armenia.Theophylact Simocatta, III.1.1; ed. . As the chief military stronghold along the northeastern border of the empire, Theodosiopolis held an important strategic location that was contested in wars between the Byzantines and Persians. Emperors Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518) and Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) both refortified the city and built new defenses during their reigns.. Nothing is known of the specific ancestry of Heraclius the Elder, but this has not prevented modern historians from speculating on the matter. Cyril Mango has supported a theory which suggests that he was a namesake descendant of Heraclius of Edessa, a 5th-century Roman general.. A passage from Sebeos's History has been understood to suggest an Arsacid origin of Heraclius the Elder. This theory was strongly supported by Cyril Toumanoff, while considered likely by Alexander Vasiliev and Irfan Shah√Æd. John of Niki√ª and Constantine Manasses seem to consider his son, Heraclius the Younger, to be a Cappadocian, which might indicate his place of birth rather than actual ancestry. Family The Historia syntomos of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople mentions a single brother of Heraclius the Elder, named Gregoras, who was the father of Nicetas.. Theophanes the Confessor mentions Epiphania as the mother of Emperor Heraclius, thus wife of Heraclius the Elder. Heraclius the Elder is mentioned as the father of Emperor Heraclius in several sources, including Theophylact, John of Niki√ª, Nikephoros I, Theophanes, Agapius the historian, the Suda, Georgios Kedrenos, Joannes Zonaras, Michael the Syrian, the Chronicle of 1234 and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos. In contrast, there is no source mentioning him in the same sentence as the siblings of Emperor Heraclius. That he was their father can be safely assumed, though. The best attested sibling of Heraclius the Younger was arguably Theodore. Maria, sister of Heraclius the Younger, is mentioned by Nikephoros I and identified as mother of Martina, whom Heraclius the Younger would go on to marry. Both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius the Younger, thus casting some doubt on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius the Younger on the occasion of the former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this sibling. Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor. Career =Under Philippicus= Heraclius the Elder is first mentioned in 586 as a general serving under Philippicus during the Roman‚ÄìPersian War of 572‚Äì591. Heraclius the Elder commanded the center of the Byzantine army at the Battle of Solachon in spring 586. Following the battle, he was sent on a scouting mission to confirm the rumour of the arrival of Persian reinforcements.Theophylact Simocatta, II.5.9‚Äì11; ed. . The Roman- Persian frontier between 565 and 591. The Byzantine force went on to invade Arzanene. Philippicus besieged Chlomaron, the chief city of the area. At this point, Jovius and Maruthas, two local leaders, defected to the Byzantines. They promised to help locate the ideal positions for building impregnable forts that would control the passage through the Taurus Mountains and Hakk√¢ri, allowing the Byzantines to control the routes that connected Arzanene with Persarmenia and Lower Mesopotamia. Philippicus assigned Heraclius the Elder, noted at this point as his second-in-command (hypostrategos), to follow the guides to the strong points indicated.Theophylact Simocatta, II.7.1, 7.6‚Äì11; ed. . Twenty men accompanied Heraclius the Elder in the mission. They left without their armour and their party soon encountered Kardarigan leading a new Persian army. Theophylact notes that \\"Kardarigan was marching against the Romans, having enrolled throngs, who were not soldiers but men inexperienced in martial clamour; he had in addition assembled a herd of baggage animals and camels, and was moving forwards.\\" Nevertheless, Kardarigan attempted to attack Heraclius' ill-equipped unit, and Heraclius had to escape by moving from ridge to ridge. By night, he sent a messenger to warn Philippicus of the approaching threat.Theophylact Simocatta, II.8.1‚Äì5; ed. . Philippicus' forces fled in disorder back into Roman territory. He managed to reach Amida and then set about restoring the old forts on Mount Izala. There, possibly due to illness, he handed over command of his army to Heraclius. Theophylact narrates: Theophylact indicates Philipiccus and Heraclius the Elder wintered together at Theodosiopolis.Theophylact Simocatta, II.9.16‚Äì10.1, 10.4‚Äì5; ed. .. In spring 587, Philippicus was again ill, and unable to campaign in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius the Elder and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, and sent them to raid Persian territory. Heraclius the Elder besieged an unnamed strong fort, using his siege engines day and night until it fell. After installing a garrison in the captured fort, Theophanes the Confessor reports that Heraclius the Elder proceeded to join General Theodore at the siege of Beioudaes, but this seems to be an error. Theophanes seems to have misunderstood the relevant passage of Theophylact which has Theodore and Andreas joining at that siege.Theophylact Simocatta, II.10.6‚Äì7, 18.1‚Äì6; ed. .. In late 587, Philippicus planned to return to Constantinople, leaving Heraclius the Elder in charge of the army for the winter season. Heraclius the Elder took measures to restore discipline to the troops. According to Theophylact, \\"Heraclius inflicted penalties for desertion on the vagrants from the Roman force; and those who had bidden farewell to labour, and who were aimlessly wandering hither and thither, were converted to good sense by punishments.\\" In early 588, Emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602) replaced Philippicus with Priscus. Philippicus wrote to Heraclius the Elder, ordering him to leave the army in the care of Narses and return to Armenia. But the same letters notified the soldiers of an imperial decree which reduced their pay by one-quarter.Theophylact Simocatta, II.18.26 and III.1.1‚Äì2. This led to a mutiny of the troops, who refused to follow Priscus' orders. The mutiny was only ended when the order was rescinded and Philippicus re-appointed as commander of the eastern army.; .. =Under Comentiolus= Heraclius the Elder resurfaces a year later, under the command of Comentiolus, in the Battle of Sisarbanon (autumn 589), in the vicinity of Nisibis. According to the account of Theophylact, Comentiolus supposedly fled towards Theodosiopolis (modern Ra's al-'Ayn) while the battle was still ongoing. Heraclius the Elder took charge of the remaining troops and led them to victory. Theophylact, however, lived and wrote during the reign of Heraclius the Younger, and is strongly biased in favour of his father. His account is thus suspected of exaggerating or even inventing Comentiolus' cowardice with the aim of glorifying Heraclius the Elder. The contemporary Evagrius Scholasticus, for instance, credits Comentiolus with being in the thick of combat, and does not mention Heraclius the Elder at all... =Armenian revolt= Heraclius the Elder is mentioned again circa 595 as magister militum per Armeniam, probably succeeding John Mystacon. The history of Sebeos provides the main account of his term. He was sent by Maurice to face Armenian rebels led by Samuel Vahewuni and Atat Khorkhoruni. Heraclius the Elder was assisted by Hamazasp Mamikonian. Heraclius the Elder seems to have been replaced by Suren. His service in Armenia was brief, but arguably reinforced his ties to the country.. =Exarch of Africa= Heraclius the Elder is next mentioned in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder had been appointed to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600.. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.. The exarchs of Africa were effectively Governor-Generals with both civilian and military powers. Their seat of power was Carthage. Historians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries ascribed much significance to this appointment, even suggesting it would require prominent ties between Heraclius the Elder and Africa or the wider Western Roman Empire. Later historians pointed out, however, that this appointment was part of a wider pattern. In the 6th century, several prominent Byzantine military commanders had started their careers in the eastern regions of the Empire, often in the vicinity of Upper Mesopotamia. Then they were transferred to North Africa at some point in their respective careers. There is therefore no indication that this rotation from the eastern to the western provinces was unusual. Charles Diehl regarded early 7th-century Byzantine Africa to have undergone an economic and demographic decline, being under constant threat by hostile Berbers. Later historians, however, have had to revise this picture in light of archaeological evidence: the Exarchate was among the most affluent areas of the Byzantine Empire, though of lesser wealth and significance than Egypt. It seems to have seen much less warfare than the Balkans, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus did in that era, thus allowing its residents a safer way of life. There is evidence of ongoing trade between Byzantine Africa and Frankish Gaul during the 7th century. Agriculture was thriving, particularly in the vicinity of the Medjerda River. The production of grain, olive oil and wine kept the local population well-fed and probably supplied their maritime trade. Fishing seems to have been another thriving field. The local elite seems to have invested in the building of churches. The main testaments to their existence and activities are examples of funerary art, particularly mosaics.. Heraclius the Elder seems to have established ties with this elite. His son, Heraclius the Younger, married his first wife Eudokia during the 7th century. Her father was Rogas, a landowner in the Exarchate.. =Revolt against Phocas= In 608, the Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder revolted against Emperor Phocas.. The subsequent campaign against Phocas was portrayed by Byzantine historians as avenging the death of Maurice, which might have been part of the motivation of this revolt. The other part, however, would be what Walter Emil Kaegi termed \\"cold political calculations\\": Carthage was at a safe distance from Constantinople and Phocas could not easily launch an attack against it. The relative wealth of the Exarchate of Africa could well enough finance a revolt. Phocas's regime arguably needed the grain and revenues from Africa, while the Exarchate sustained itself with relative ease. Meanwhile, the Persian shah Khosrau II had secured control of Dara and was mobilizing his troops for a large-scale invasion into Byzantine territories. News of this campaign could have well reached Heraclius the Elder. With Phocas facing two separate military fronts, the emperor would be unable to concentrate the majority of his troops on either one of them, encouraging Heraclius the Elder of his chances to succeed in this confrontation.. After their revolt, Heraclius the Elder and Heraclius the Younger were proclaimed joint consuls. There is no indication in the sources on how this was achieved, i.e., whether Heraclius the Elder was self-appointed or officially proclaimed by the Senate of Carthage, \\"whose members had no legal right to designate a Roman consul\\". Nevertheless, the significance of the proclamation was evident. No private individuals had been proclaimed consuls since the reign of Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). Since then it was merely another title exclusively used by the Byzantine emperors. By this proclamation, Heraclius the Elder was arguably making a first step towards becoming emperor himself, while legitimizing his connection to the long history of Rome. The mints of Carthage and later Alexandria produced coins depicting Heraclius the Elder and his namesake son wearing consular robes.. John of Antioch and the Patriarch Nikephoros both report that Heraclius the Elder maintained correspondence with Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and former commander of the army. By that time, Priscus was the son-in-law of Phocas but reportedly held a grudge against the emperor. He allegedly promised Heraclius the Elder support in case of a rebellion and confirmed it once the rebellion had started. The story is somewhat suspect. While there was major dissension in Constantinople and Priscus did in time defect to Heraclius the Elder, there is nothing to suggest that Priscus helped incite the revolt. Patriarch Nikephoros reports that Heraclius the Elder held council with his brother Gregoras before proclaiming his revolt, possibly indicating that Gregoras was acting as his advisor. He also reports that Gregoras hoped to promote his own son Nicetas to the throne, although this is considered unlikely at best by modern historians.. The situation in 609‚Äì610 was quickly becoming dire for Phocas and his loyalists. Their defense against the Sassanid Empire had failed. There were Persian forces in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria and the Anatolian provinces. Rebel Byzantine forces held Africa and Egypt. Slavs were occupying northern Illyricum. In Thessalonica and various towns of Anatolia and Syria, the Blues and Greens were settling their differences with open conflict. In areas of Syria, the Jews were revolting and lynching Christians. Even in Constantinople, the crowds taunted Phocas for his love of liquor, implying alcoholism.. In 610, the Persian general, Shahrbaraz, was approaching Antioch, but the rebels of Africa posed a more immediate threat than the Persian front. Having secured control of Egypt, they proceeded to invade Syria and Cyprus while a large fleet under Heraclius the Younger set sail for Constantinople. Supporters from Sicily, Crete and Thessalonica were joining his campaign. The rebels reached Constantinople in October 610. The only forces available to Phocas to defend the city were the Excubitors of his bodyguard and the irregular forces of the Blues and Greens, the city's racing factions. Priscus, the commander of the Excubitors, chose the moment to reveal his allegiance to Heraclius the Younger. The Greens also changed sides in support of Heraclius the Younger and Constantinople fell to the Heraclii with relative ease.. Heraclius the Younger ultimately became the new emperor and Phocas was executed, along with several of his kinsmen and loyalists. According to John of Nikiu, Heraclius the Elder rejoiced at the news of his son rising to the throne, but died soon afterwards.. Assessment While Heraclius the Elder was a prominent general of his time, his military achievements were rather modest. The Byzantine historians covering his career were arguably attempting to magnify their importance to give Heraclius the Younger an exalted ancestry.

This system uses PostScript file format to encode font information. \\"PostScript fonts\\" may also separately be used to refer to a basic set of fonts included as standards in the PostScript system, such as Times, Helvetica and Avant Garde. History Type 1 and Type 3 fonts, though introduced by Adobe in 1984 as part of the PostScript page description language, did not see widespread use until March 1985 when the first laser printer to use the PostScript language, the Apple LaserWriter, was introduced. Even then, in 1985, the outline fonts were resident only in the printer, and the screen used bitmap fonts as substitutes for outline fonts. Although originally part of PostScript, Type 1 fonts used a simplified set of drawing operations compared to ordinary PostScript (programmatic elements such as loops and variables were removed, much like PDF), but Type 1 fonts added \\"hints\\" to help low-resolution rendering. Originally, Adobe kept the details of their hinting scheme undisclosed and used a (simple) encryption scheme to protect Type 1 outlines and hints, which still persists today (although the encryption scheme and key has since been published by Adobe). Despite these measures, Adobe's scheme was quickly reverse-engineered by other players in the industry. Adobe nevertheless required anyone working with Type 1 fonts to license their technology. Type 3 fonts allowed for all the sophistication of the PostScript language, but without the standardized approach to hinting (though some companies such as ATF implemented their own proprietary schemes) or an encryption scheme. Other differences further added to the confusion. The cost of the licensing was considered very high at this time, and Adobe continued to stonewall on more attractive rates. It was this issue that led Apple to design their own system, TrueType, around 1991. Immediately following the announcement of TrueType, Adobe published ‚ÄùAdobe type 1 font format‚Äù, a detailed specification for the format. Font development tools such as Fontographer added the ability to create Type 1 fonts. The Type 2 format has since been used as one basis for the modern OpenType Format. Technology By using PostScript (PS) language, the glyphs are described with cubic B√©zier curves (as opposed to the quadratic curves of TrueType), and thus a single set of glyphs can be resized through simple mathematical transformations, which can then be sent to a PostScript-ready printer. Because the data of Type 1 is a description of the outline of a glyph and not a raster image (i.e. a bitmap), Type 1 fonts are commonly referred to as \\"outline fonts,\\" as opposed to bitmap fonts. For users wanting to preview these typefaces on an electronic display, small versions of a font need extra hints and anti-aliasing to look legible and attractive on screen. This often came in the form of an additional bitmap font of the same typeface, optimized for screen display. Otherwise, in order to preview the Type 1 fonts in typesetting applications, the Adobe Type Manager utility was required. Font type =Type 0= Type 0 is a \\"composite\\" font format - as described in the PostScript Language Reference Manual, 2nd Edition. A composite font is composed of a high-level font that references multiple descendent fonts. =Type 1= Type 1 (also known as PostScript, PostScript Type 1, PS1, T1 or Adobe Type 1) is the font format for single-byte digital fonts for use with Adobe Type Manager software and with PostScript printers. It can support font hinting. It was originally a proprietary specification, but Adobe released the specification to third-party font manufacturers provided that all Type 1 fonts adhere to it. Type 1 fonts are natively supported in Mac OS X, and in Windows 2000 and later via the GDI API.Introduction to Configuration and Management: What's new in Windows 2000 (They are not supported in the Windows GDI+, WPF or DirectWrite APIs.) =Type 2= Type 2 is a character string format that offers a compact representation of the character description procedures in an outline font file. The format is designed to be used with the Compact Font Format (CFF). The CFF/Type2 format is the basis for Type 1 OpenType fonts, and is used for embedding fonts in Acrobat 3.0 PDF files (PDF format version 1.2). =Type 3= Type 3 font (also known as PostScript Type 3 or PS3, T3 or Adobe Type 3) consists of glyphs defined using the full PostScript language, rather than just a subset. Because of this, a Type 3 font can do some things that Type 1 fonts cannot do, such as specify shading, color, and fill patterns. However, it does not support hinting. Adobe Type Manager did not support Type 3 fonts, and they are not supported as native WYSIWYG fonts on any version of Mac OS or Windows. =Type 4= Type 4 is a format that was used to make fonts for printer font cartridges and for permanent storage on a printer's hard disk. The character descriptions are expressed in the Type 1 format. Adobe does not document this proprietary format. =Type 5= Type 5 is similar to the Type 4 format but is used for fonts stored in the ROMs of a PostScript printer. It is also known as CROM font (Compressed ROM font). =Types 9, 10, 11= Ghostscript referred them as CID font types 0, 1, and 2 respectively, documented in Adobe supplements. Types 9, 10, and 11 are CID-keyed fonts for storing Types 1, 3, and 42, respectively. =Type 14= Type 14, or the Chameleon font format, is used to represent a large number of fonts in a small amount of storage space such as printer ROM. The core set of Chameleon fonts consists of one Master Font, and a set of font descriptors that specify how the Master Font is to be adjusted to give the desired set of character shapes for a specific typeface. Adobe does not document the Type 14 format. It was introduced with PostScript 3 in 1997, and de-emphasized in later years as storage became cheaper. =Type 32= Type 32 is used for downloading bitmap fonts to PostScript interpreters with version number 2016 or greater. The bitmap characters are transferred directly into the interpreter's font cache, thus saving space in the printer's memory. =Type 42= The Type 42 font format is a PostScript wrapper around a TrueType font, allowing PostScript-capable printers containing a TrueType rasterizer (which was first implemented in PostScript interpreter version 2010 as an optional feature, later standard) to print TrueType fonts. Support for multibyte CJK TrueType fonts was added in PostScript version 2015. The out-of- sequence choice of the number 42 is said to be a jesting reference to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. Core Font Set In addition to font types, PostScript specifications also defined the Core Font Set, which dictates the minimum number of fonts, and character sets to be supported by each font. In original PostScript, there are 13 base fonts: *Courier (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique) *Helvetica (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique) *Times (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Symbol In PostScript Level 2, there are 35 fonts, which is a superset of the 13 base fonts: *ITC Avant Garde Gothic (Book, Book Oblique, Demi, Demi Oblique) *ITC Bookman (Light, Light Italic, Demi, Demi Italic) *Courier (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique) *Helvetica (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique, Condensed, Condensed Oblique, Condensed Bold, Condensed Bold Oblique) *New Century Schoolbook (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Palatino (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Symbol *Times (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *ITC Zapf Chancery (Medium Italic) *ITC Zapf Dingbats As a result of this, many computer operating systems contain these fonts or clones of them (as on the GhostScript package). In PostScript 3, 136 fonts are specified, which includes the standard 35 fonts; core fonts in Windows 95, Windows NT and Macintosh; selected fonts from Microsoft Office and the HP 110 font set. New fonts include: *Albertus (Light, Roman, Italic) *Antique Olive (Roman, Italic, Bold, Compact) *Apple Chancery *Arial (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Bodoni (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Poster, Poster Compressed) *Carta (a dingbat) *Chicago *Clarendon (Light, Roman, Bold) *Cooper Black, Cooper Black Italic *Copperplate Gothic (32BC, 33BC) *Coronet *Eurostile (Medium, Bold, Extended No.2, Bold Extended No.2) *Geneva *Gill Sans (Light, Light Italic, Book, Book Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Extra Bold, Condensed, Condensed Bold) *Goudy (Oldstyle, Oldstyle Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Extra Bold) *Helvetica (Narrow, Narrow Oblique, Narrow Bold, Narrow Bold Oblique) *Hoefler Text (Roman, Italic, Black, Black Italic), Hoefler Ornaments *Joanna (Roman/Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Letter Gothic (Regular, Slanted, Bold, Bold Slanted) *ITC Lubalin Graph (Book, Oblique, Demi, Demi Oblique) *ITC Mona Lisa Recut *Marigold *Monaco *New York *Optima (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Oxford *Stempel Garamond (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Tekton (Regular) *Times New Roman (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *Univers (45 Light, 45 Light Oblique, 55, 55 Oblique, 65 Bold, 65 Bold Oblique, 57 Condensed, 57 Condensed Oblique, 67 Condensed Bold, 67 Condensed Bold Oblique, 53 Extended, 53 Extended Oblique, 63 Extended Bold, 63 Extended Bold Oblique) *Wingdings In PDF, the following 14 fonts are defined: *Courier (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique) *Helvetica (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique) *Symbol *Times (Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) *ITC Zapf Dingbats However, in recent versions of Adobe Reader, Helvetica and Times were internally replaced by Arial and Times New Roman respectively. Character sets Although PostScript fonts can contain any character set, there are character sets specifically developed by Adobe, which are used by fonts developed by Adobe. =Adobe Western 2= It includes a basic character set containing upper and lowercase letters, figures, accented characters, and punctuation. These fonts also contain currency symbols (cent, dollar, euro, florin, pound sterling, yen), standard ligatures (fi, fl), common fractions (1/4, 1/2, 3/4), common mathematics operators, superscript numerals (1,2,3), common delimiters and conjoiners, and other symbols (including daggers, trademark, registered trademark, copyright, paragraph, litre and estimated symbol). Compared to the ISO-Adobe character set, Western 2 also adds 17 additional symbol characters: euro, litre, estimated, omega, pi, partialdiff, delta, product, summation, radical, infinity, integral, approxequal, notequal, lessequal, greaterequal, and lozenge. Fonts with an Adobe Western 2 character set support most western languages including Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, Gaelic, German, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Sami, Spanish, Swahili and Swedish. This standard superseded ISO-Adobe as the new minimum character set standard as implemented in OpenType fonts from Adobe. =Adobe CE= Fonts with an Adobe CE character set also include the characters necessary to support the following central European languages: Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian (Latin), Slovak, Slovenian and Turkish. =Adobe-GB1= This Simplified Chinese character collection provides support for the GB 1988-89, GB 2312-80, GB/T 12345-90, GB 13000.1-93, and GB 18030-2005 character set standards. Supported encodings include ISO-2022, EUC-CN, GBK, UCS-2, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and the mixed one, two- and four-byte encoding as published in GB 18030-2005. =Adobe- CNS1= This Traditional Chinese character collection provides support for the Big-5 and CNS 11643-1992 character set standards. It also includes support for a number of extensions to Big-5, which contain characters used mainly in the Hong Kong locale. Primary supported Big-5 extensions include HKSCS. Supported encodings include ISO-2022, EUC-TW, Big Five, UCS-2, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. In Adobe-CNS1-7, 23 additional glyphs were added, with 25 additional mappings for its Unicode CMap resources.HKSCS-2016 & Adobe-CNS1-7 =Adobe- Japan1= It is a series of character sets developed for Japanese fonts. Adobe's latest, the Adobe-Japan1-6 set covers character sets from JIS X 0208, ISO-2022-JP, Microsoft Windows 3.1 J, JIS X 0213:2004, JIS X 0212-1990, Kyodo News U-PRESS character set. =Adobe-Japan2= It was originally as an implementation of JIS X 0212-1990 character set standard and the Macintosh extensions, but with the introduction of Adobe-Japan1 supplement 6 (Adobe- Japan1-6) standard, Adobe-Japan2-0 became obsolete. =Adobe-Korea1= This Korean character collection provides support for the KS X 1001:1992 and KS X 1003:1992 character set standards, and their selected corporate variations. Supported encodings include ISO-2022-KR, EUC-KR, Johab, UHC, UCS-2, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. =ISO-Adobe= Fonts with an ISO-Adobe character set support most western languages including: Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, Gaelic, German, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Sami, Spanish, Swahili and Swedish. This is the standard character set in most PostScript Type 1 fonts from Adobe. File formats =CID= The CID-keyed font (also known as CID font, CID-based font, short for Character Identifier font) is a font structure, originally developed for PostScript font formats, designed to address a large number of glyphs. It was developed to support pictographic East Asian character sets, as these comprise many more characters than the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic writing systems. Adobe developed CID-keyed font formats to solve problems with the OCF/Type 0 format, for addressing complex Asian-language (CJK) encoding and very large character sets. CID-keyed internals can be used with the Type 1 font format for standard CID-keyed fonts, or Type 2 for CID-keyed OpenType fonts. CID-keyed fonts often reference \\"character collections,\\" static glyph sets defined for different language coverage purposes. Although in principle any font maker may define character collections, Adobe's are the only ones in wide usage. Each character collection has an encoding which maps Character IDs to glyphs. Each member glyph in a character collection is identified by a unique character identifier (CID). Such CIDs are generally supplemental to other encodings or mappings such as Unicode. Character collections are uniquely named by registry, ordering and supplement, such as \\"Adobe-Japan1-6.\\" The registry is the developer (such as Adobe). The so-called \\"ordering\\" gives the purpose of the collection (for example, \\"Japan1\\"). The supplement number (such as 6) indicates incremental additions: for a given language, there may be multiple character collections of increasing size, each a superset of the last, using a higher supplement number. The Adobe-Japan1-0 collection is 8284 glyphs, while Adobe-Japan1-6 is 23,058 glyphs. CID-keyed fonts may be made without reference to a character collection by using an \\"identity\\" encoding, such as Identity-H (for horizontal writing) or Identity-V (for vertical). Such fonts may each have a unique character set, and in such cases the CID number of a glyph is not informative; generally the Unicode encoding is used instead, potentially with supplemental information. CID-keyed fonts internally have their character sets divided into \\"rows,\\" with the advantage that each row may have different global hinting parameters applied. In theory it would be possible to make CID- keyed OpenType versions of western fonts. This would seem desirable for some such fonts because of the hinting advantages. However, according to Adobe, much of the software infrastructure (applications, drivers, operating systems) makes incorrect assumptions about CID-keyed fonts in ways that makes such fonts behave badly in real-world usage. Adobe ClearScan technology (as from Acrobat 9 Pro) creates custom Type1-CID fonts to match the visual appearance of a scanned document after optical character recognition (OCR). ClearScan does not replace the fonts with system fonts or substitute them by Type1-MM (as in Acrobat 8 and earlier versions), but uses these newly created custom fonts. The custom fonts are embedded in the PDF file (this is mandatory). In Acrobat DC, it is no more called \\"ClearScan\\" but \\"Recognize Text - Editable Text & Images\\",In the PDF file properties, the following metadata will be added: \\"pdf:Producer: Adobe Acrobat Pro DC Paper Capture Plug-in with ClearScan\\". and it is now possible to edit the text.Acrobat DC and ClearScan =Compact Font Format= Compact Font Format (also known as CFF font format, Type 2 font format, or CFF/Type 2 font format) is a lossless compaction of the Type 1 format using Type 2 charstrings. It is designed to use less storage space than Type 1 fonts, by using operators with multiple arguments, various predefined default values, more efficient allotment of encoding values and shared subroutines within a FontSet (family of fonts). The so-called PostScript or Type 1 flavor of OpenType fonts, also called OpenType CFF, contains glyph outlines and hints in a CFF table. CFF fonts can be embedded in PDF files, starting with PDF version 1.2. It is the usual approach to representing a Type 1 font within PDF. CID-keyed fonts can be represented within CFF with Type 2 charstrings for CID-keyed OpenType fonts. A Type 1 font can be losslessly converted into CFF/Type2 format and back. =Multiple Master= Multiple master fonts (or MM fonts) are an extension to Adobe Systems' Type 1 PostScript fonts. Multiple master fonts contain one or more \\"masters\\" ‚Äî that is, original font styles, e.g. a light, a regular and a bold version ‚Äî and enable a user to interpolate these font styles along a continuous range of \\"axes.\\" While Multiple Master font are not common in end user fonts anymore, they still play an important role when developing complex font families. =OpenType= PostScript glyph data can be embedded in OpenType font files, but OpenType fonts are not limited to using PostScript outlines. PostScript outlines in OpenType fonts are encoded in the Type2 Compact Font Format (CFF). OpenType conversion When Adobe converted PostScript Type 1 and Type 1 multiple master fonts to OpenType CFF format, they were made based on the last Type 1/MM versions from the Adobe Type Library fonts. In addition to file format change, there are other changes: *All alphabetic fonts had 17 additional characters included: the euro (some had already gotten this in Type 1), litre, estimated, and the 14 Mac \\"symbol substitution\\" characters. Symbol substitution was a scheme used on Mac OS to deal with the fact that the standard \\"ISO-Adobe\\" character set omitted certain characters which were part of the MacRoman character set. When one of these 14 characters was typed in a Type 1 font with standard encoding, both ATM and the printer driver would get a generic glyph in the Times style from the Symbol font. In the OpenType conversion, these characters were built into every font, getting some degree of font-specific treatment (weight and width). *Fonts that had unkerned accented characters had additional kerning to deal with accented characters. *Font families that included separate Type 1 expert fonts or Cyrillic fonts have these glyphs built into the \\"base font\\" in their OpenType counterparts. *Multiple master fonts were converted to individual OpenType fonts; each font consisting of a former Multiple Master instance. For many Adobe Originals fonts, particularly those designed by Robert Slimbach, Adobe did some degree of redesign along with the conversion to OpenType. The typeface Helvetica Narrow was not converted to OpenType, because the Type 1 original was a mathematically squished version of Helvetica, rather than an actually designed condensed typeface. This was originally done to conserve ROM space in PostScript printers.Type 1 (\\"PostScript\\") to OpenType font conversion As a result of the above changes, Adobe no longer guarantees metric compatibility between Type 1 and OpenType fonts. However, Adobe claims the change is minimal for Adobe (not Adobe Originals) fonts, if: *Text is written in English *The formatted text contains only non-accented characters *Only characters that were present in the old fonts are used, without the former Symbol substitution characters *Applications are used which base line spacing solely on point size or leading, and not on the bounding box of the font =Original Composite Font= Original Composite Font format (which uses a Type 0 file structure) was Adobe's first effort to implement a format for fonts with large character sets, debuted with PostScript level 2. Adobe then developed the CID-keyed font file format which was designed to offer better performance and a more flexible architecture for addressing the complex Asian- language encoding and character set issues. Adobe does not document or support OCF font format. OCF font metrics are described in Adobe Composite Font Metrics file. = Adobe Font Metrics, Adobe Composite Font Metrics, Adobe Multiple Font Metrics= Adobe Font Metrics (AFM), Adobe Composite Font Metrics (ACFM), Adobe Multiple Font Metrics (AMFM) files contain general font information and font metrics information for the font program. These files are generally used directly only in Unix environments. An AFM file provides both global metrics for a font program and the metrics of each individual character. The metrics of a multiple master font are described by one AMFM file, which specifies the control data and global font information, plus one AFM file for each of the master designs in the font. An ACFM file provides information about the structure of a composite font. Specifically, the global metrics of the composite font program and the global metrics of each of its immediately descendent font programs. ACFM file does not associate with a base font, but act as the top-level structure of a composite font. The character metrics of individual characters in the composite font are described completely by one of more associated AFM files. The formats are sufficiently similar that a compliant parser can parse AFM, ACFM, and AMFM files. =Printer Font ASCII= Printer Font ASCII (PFA) is a pure ASCII version of a Type 1 font program, containing in particular a font's glyph data. It is pure PostScript code without any sort of wrapper, and can be copied in full into a PS file to define the font to the PS interpreter. PFA is the preferred format for Type 1 fonts used in UNIX environments, and usually carries a \\".PFA\\" file name extension. Though these files syntactically can contain arbitrary PostScript code, they usually follow a rather rigid formula in order to allow readers that are less than full PostScript interpreters to process them (for example to subset the font). The first section of the file is called the clear text portion, and begins constructing those data structures that define the font in the PostScript interpreter; the information here are things Adobe in the 1980's were comfortable having public, and much of it would be present also in the companion AFM file. The last two operators in the clear text portion are \`currentfile eexec\` (encrypted exec), which instructs the interpreter to switch to reading the current file as an encrypted stream of instructions. The following encrypted portion is again PostScript code for finishing constructing the font data structures‚Äîa lot of it consists of charstrings, which is rather a kind of bytecode, but at the font definition stage those are merely data stored in the font‚Äîeven if that code is encrypted (which produces arbitrary byte values) and then hex-encoded to ensure the overall ASCII nature of the file. The data structures created here are marked \`noaccess\` to make them inaccessible for subsequent PostScript code. The final action in the encrypted portion is to switch back to reading the file normally, but since eexec would read ahead a bit it was impossible to know at exactly which character normal processing would resume. Therefore PFA files end with a trailer of 512 zeroes followed by a \`cleartomark\` operator that throws away any operands that might have ended up on the stack as a result of interpreting those zeroes starting from a random position. =Printer Font Binary= Printer Font Binary (PFB) is a binary PostScript font format created by Adobe Systems, usually carrying \\".PFB\\" file name extension. It contains a font's glyph data. The PFB format is a lightweight wrapper to allow more compact storage of the data in a PFA file. The file consists of a number of blocks, each of which is marked as ASCII or binary. To recreate the corresponding PFA file, one takes the ASCII blocks verbatim and hex-encodes the binary blocks. The binary blocks are those which make up the encrypted portion of the font program. =LaserWriter Font= LaserWriter Font (LWFN) is a binary PostScript font format used on Classic Mac OS, conceptually similar to the Printer Font Binary format but using the Mac OS resource fork data structure rather than a custom wrapper for the font data. It contains the glyph data for one font. \`LWFN\` is the file type code for this kind of file. It would not carry any extension, and the file name would be an abbreviation of the PostScript name of the font, according to a 5+3+3+‚Ä¶ formula: the name is read as being in CamelCase and split into subwords, up to 5 letters are kept from the first subword, and up to 3 letters of any subsequent subword. Palatino-BoldItalic would thus be found in the file PalatBolIta. =Printer Font Metric= Printer Font Metric (PFM) is a binary version of AFM, usually carrying \\".PFM\\" file name extension. It contains font metric information. The PFM format is documented in the Windows 3.1 \\"Printers and Fonts Kit\\" help file (PFK31WH.HLP). Some details are also covered in the Windows 3.1 \\"Device Drivers Adaptation Guide\\" help file (DDAG31WH.HLP). Both of those documents are part of the Windows 3.1 Device Development Kit (DDK), which is still available (October 2008) to MSDN subscribers. =.INF= .inf (INFormation) files contain application-specific information in plain ASCII text, such as font menu names for Windows and DOS-based applications. When a font is installed in Windows, the ATM Installer software takes the AFM and the INF file as input and generates the required PFM file at installation time. The AFM and INF files are not installed in the user's system. =.MMM= .MMM files are used for the metric data needed by multiple master fonts for the Windows environment. =.OFM= .OFM is the extension used by OS/2 for its version of binary font metrics file, starting from version 2.1. Support for Microsoft Windows Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4 and Windows Me do not support Type 1 fonts natively. Adobe Type Manager is needed in order to use these fonts on these operating systems. Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista support Type 1 fonts natively through GDI calls. The Windows Presentation Foundation introduced in Windows Vista, which is also available for Windows XP however drops support for Type 1 fonts, in favor of Type 2 fonts. For Microsoft Windows platforms that natively support PostScript, only binary PostScript and OpenType file formats are supported. Windows Presentation Foundation (formerly codenamed Avalon) in Windows Vista supports rasterizing OpenType CFF/Type 2 fonts, whereas Type 1 fonts will still be supported in GDI, but not in GDI+. PostScript font utilities The t1utils font utility package by I. Lee Hetherington and Eddie Kohler provides tools for decoding Type 1 fonts into a human-readable, and editable format (t1disasm), reassembling them back into fonts (t1asm), for converting between the ASCII and binary formats (t1ascii and t1binary), and for converting from Macintosh PostScript format to Adobe PostScript font format (unpost).

Originally situated at the Assembly House, Norwich, the school moved to its present location Eaton Grove, 95 Newmarket Road in 1933. Eaton Grove is Grade II listed. The school occupies several buildings, all of which were originally private houses; Stafford House (preparatory school), Eaton Grove (senior school) and Lanchester House (sixth form). Year Naming Norwich High School uses its own nomenclature for the year groups.

Pupils are required to take at least ten General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and IGCSE subjects in Lower V (Year 10) and Upper V (Year 11). In the sixth form, pupils usually study four or five AS-Level subjects for one year and most continue with three subjects to A-Level. Many students take the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). In total, there are 24 subjects offered at A-Level. Academically, the school is one of the highest performing independent schools in East Anglia, behind the Norwich School. Facilities The school's facilities include a sports hall, performing arts studio, main hall (including stage), junior school hall, lecture theatre, boardroom, 25-metre swimming pool, 13 acres of playing fields, fitness suite, 8 tennis courts and 1 astro turf. Scholarships Academic scholarships and means-tested bursaries are offered upon entry to Upper III and Lower VI. The scholarships offered in Upper III are music scholarships based on the performance of the candidate in an audition and academic scholarships on their performance in the transfer or entrance to the senior school examination, whereas the scholarships offered in Lower VI are based on the performance in an optional examination based on English, Mathematics, Science and a foreign language of the candidate's choice from French, German or Spanish.

Sir George Bowyer, 7th and 3rd Baronet DL (8 October 1811 ‚Äì 7 June 1883), was a British Barrister-at-Law and Liberal politician. Born in Radley Hall in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), he was the son of Sir George Bowyer, 6th Baronet, and Anne Hammond Douglas. Bowyer was a cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was then called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1836. He received an honorary Master of Arts by the University of Oxford in 1839 and an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws in 1844. One year later, he changed to Lincoln's Inn. In 1860, he succeeded to both baronetcies held by his father. Having contested Reading in the 1849 Reading by-election, Bowyer became a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dundalk from 1852 to 1868 and for Wexford County from 1874 to 1880. The Roman Catholic Church of St John of Jerusalem in Great Ormond Street in London was built at his own cost. He was made a Knight of Justice of the Order of Malta, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great and a Grand Collar of the Constantian Order of St George of Naples. Bowyer served as chamberlain to Pius IX, who appointed him a Knight of the Great Ribbon of the Order of Pius IX. He was further a Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire. He was a member of the Manchester Unity Order of Oddfellows, at one time he led a procession under a banner named Loyal Bowyer Union Lodge of Odd Fellows. Bowyer died in King's Bench Walk in London, aged 71 and unmarried. He was found dead in his bed and was buried in Radley in Berkshire on 7 June 1883. He was succeeded by his younger brother.

It connected Bridport with the main line network at Maiden Newton, and opened on 12 November 1857. It was extended to West Bay in 1884, but the extension was not well used and it closed to passengers in 1930. The remaining branch closed in 1975. Origins During the 1840s a number of railway schemes had been proposed, that would have put Bridport on a main line from London to Exeter. This included the Bridport and Exeter Railway, and schemes to extend the London and South Western Railway to Exeter from Dorchester. As late as 1853 there was a firm proposal to build such a line, but it fell through and the present-day route via Yeovil was adopted instead. Dismayed at being abandoned from the main line system, businessmen in Bridport observed that the Great Western Railway (GWR) was making plans to extend its partly built line, the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (WS&WR;) from Castle Cary to Weymouth and they resolved to build a branch line to connect their town to that line. (The incorporating Act of the WS&WR; had originally authorised a branch to Bridport).E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol I, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927 Accordingly, on 5 May 1855 they obtained the authorising Act of Parliament to build a branch line to a junction with the GWR at Maiden Newton.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, It is said to be the last broad gauge line in Dorset. Opening Map of the Bridport RailwayThe line opened on 12 November 1857, the GWR line having opened throughout earlier that year. There was one intermediate station at Poorstock, renamed Powerstock in 1860. It was constructed in the broad gauge and worked by the GWR. It had an unusual type of permanent way described by Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate: > It has been laid with MacDonnell's patent permanent way, consisting of > bridge rails weighing 51 lbs and longitudinal rolled iron sleepers weighing > 60 lbs to the lineal yard, which are secured to each other by screw bolts > and nuts. The gauge is preserved by angle iron cross-ties, nine feet apart; > and a strip of wood has been inserted between the rails and sleepers to > prevent rigidity. This description of permanent way has been already tried > on the Bristol & Exeter Railway, and with such success as to induce the > Company to lay down an additional portion of it.Captain Tyler, report to the > Board of Trade, 1857, quoted in MacDermot In the nineteenth century The line was leased to the larger company for 21 years from 1 July 1858. Toller station was opened on 31 March 1862, serving the village of Toller Porcorum. (Toller Fratrum was more easily accessed from Maiden Newton station). The branch was converted to standard gauge in June 1874. It was leased for a further 21 years from 1 July 1882. The line was extended from Bridport station to West Bay, a little over two miles, opened on 31 March 1884.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 The route Running through undulating topography, the route had to negotiate difficult terrain. It ran broadly west from Maiden Newton at first, climbing the valley of the River Hooke. After a summit west of Toller, the line turned south-west to find the valley of the River Asker and descend into Bridport. The short 1874 extension followed the same river to the sea at West Bay. The route climbed from Maiden Newton to a summit west of Toller, near the 4 mile post, with a steepest gradient of 1 in 85. From there it fell at 1 in 50 for a mile and a half, and falling nearly as steeply‚Äî1 in 62 for part of the way‚Äîto Bridport. The West Bay extension was comparatively easy. =Toller= Toller station was opened on 31 March 1862; the platform had no shelter originally. There was a single siding, later made double-ended. In the first half of the twentieth century, milk traffic was a dominant activity. =Powerstock= The only intermediate station when the original line opened, Powerstock station had a single platform with \\"a small goods yard partly quarried out of the hillside\\". In a west-facing photograph in Oakley, the summit as the line crosses the watershed towards the Asker Valley is very evident. =Bridport= The original Bridport station was a stone-built terminus with two platforms under a train shed. When opened the station provided a focus in the hitherto remote area for distribution of the net and twine products made locally. When the line was extended to West Bay, the alignment of the existing station had to be altered, and one platform line was removed to allow the other to be curved towards the new extension. Between 1887 and 1902 it was known locally as Bradpole Road station to avoid confusion with East Street.Mike Oakley, Discover Dorset Railway Stations, The Dovecote Press, Wimborne, 2001, =Bridport East Street= The station was built on the 1884 extension to West Bay, at a location a little nearer the town centre. A thatched cottage adjacent was acquired and turned into the limited station accommodation and station master's house. In 1904 the GWR provided a new building with these amenities. =Bridport West Bay= The extension to West Bay opened in 1884 and the GWR hoped that the area would develop into a major holiday resort. The harbour itself had substantially declined in importance over the years, reducing to 10% of its former trade from 1830 to 1880,David St John Thomas, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain; Volume 1: the West Country, Third edition, 1966, David & Charles, Newton Abbot in part because of the arrival of the railway itself. The station was initially called Bridport Harbour, but it was soon renamed Bridport West Bay to encourage the hoped-for holiday business. There was a signal box on the single platform, and some siding accommodation. Goods activity ceased on 3 December 1962 except for a very limited traffic in coal and shingle, which finished on 1 January 1966. Twentieth century operation The Great Western Railway acquired the line by Act of Parliament of 26 July 1901. During the First World War the West Bay extension was closed as an austerity measure (between 31 December 1915 and 7 July 1919. It re-opened at the end of the war but lost its passenger service on 22 September 1930 when the GWR decided that the hoped for resort would never arrive. The goods service continued until 3 December 1962 when it was withdrawn and the tracks lifted south of Bridport station. Then in 1965 the goods service was withdrawn from the entire branch and at about the same time steam traction was withdrawn. The track layout at Maiden Newton was altered so that through running was no longer possible, in April 1968. This left the line as a siding, a simple railway with no signals other than those at the junction, from Maiden Newton. Services in the final years of operation were provided in the main by a single car diesel multiple unit, usually a Class 121. At Maiden Newton, the branch had a bay platform on the upside; trains entered in a southerly direction. In twentieth century steam days, there was a siding alongside the branch on a rising gradient, and the customary operation was to propel an arrived passenger train into the siding; the locomotive then moved to another siding, and the passenger coaches descended by gravity into the bay platform under the control of the guard.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Yeovil to Dorchester including the Branch Line to Bridport, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1990, Passenger train service The 1895 BradshawBradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, shows six passenger trains each way on weekdays. The first train is the 08:20 from Bridport Bradpole Road (i.e. the original terminus) to Maiden Newton; all subsequent trains ran throughout from Maiden Newton to West Bay, with a final short working from West Bay to Bridport only. On Saturdays this was extended to Maiden Newton, and returned as a non-stop Maiden Newton to Bridport train at 22:26 connecting out of a late train. The passenger service was capable of being operated by one train set. Most trains made a connection to or from the Yeovil direction at Maiden Newton. There were two return trips on Sundays. By 1922 BradshawBradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985 shows a more complicated pattern, with nine trains from Maiden Newton (three of them only running to Bridport station, now designated \\"Bridport for Lyme Regis\\"). The 13:50 from Maiden Newton had a connection from Paddington at 10:30, by a slip carriage on the Cornish Riviera Express, slipped at Westbury and then running to Weymouth, and making the connection at Maiden Newton. In the up direction, there were five trains from West Bay to Maiden Newton, and three from Bridport. In addition there was one short working from West Bay to Bridport at 16:52. At least two train sets would have been required to operate this service, and it is likely that some of the unbalanced trains were mixed passenger and goods. In its final years of operation, services were usually provided by a British Rail Class 121 diesel railcar. Closure Last train at Maiden Newton The line was marked for closure in the Beeching Report but the narrow roads of the area and a subsidy from Dorset County Council kept it running. In 1971 the British Railways Board applied to close the line (under the provisions of Section 56 of the Transport Act 1962). Annual losses were stated to be ¬£54,000. Following a public enquiry, the Secretary of State for the Environment gave permission to withdraw the service and the line was duly closed on 5 May 1975. This was one of the last closures directly linked to the Beeching report. With a surge in demand by local people and rail enthusiasts seeking a final trip, a three carriage Class 117 diesel multiple unit train was used instead of the usual single carriage Class 121 during the final days of operation. The Class 117 and Class 121 were used together to make a four carriage train on the final day of operation. A replacement bus service was operated at first by Pearce's of Cattistock, but the operator changed with local authority contract. The track was lifted during the autumn of 1975 and little trace of it remains in some places. The line today The station building from Bridport was moved to Beer Heights Light Railway near Seaton in Devon, and the station building from Toller is now in the same county as the building at on the South Devon Railway. After many years as the office of a boatyard the station building at West Bay has had its appearance restored and houses a cafe. There is a short length of track. Ironically this means that the first station on the line to close is the only one left with track. The station building at Powerstock has been a private bungalow since well before the closure of the line and the site of East Street disappeared under Bridport's ring road some years ago. The junction station at Maiden Newton remains open to trains on the Heart of Wessex Line. Part of the railway line can be walked and cycled on, from Maiden Newton Station for about half a mile, and parts of the old line past Toller Porcorum. Sustrans have funding to use the old line as a cycle path from Maiden Newton to Bridport.

It is dedicated to Our Lady of Aparecida as the principal Patroness of Brazil. Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Aparecida roughly translates to Our Lady of Conception Who Appeared. It is the largest Cathedral and the second largest Catholic church in the world in interior area after the St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. History The site has its origins in the finding of a statue of the Virgin Mary. According to local tradition, three fishermen were attempting to catch a large amount of fish in the Para√≠ba River for a banquet honoring the visit of S√£o Paulo Governor, Pedro de Almeida in 1717. Despite their prayers, their attempts were fruitless until late in the day, one of the fishermen cast his net and pulled it back to find the statue of the Virgin Mary. Upon his next cast, he found the head. The group cleaned the statue, wrapped it in cloth, and returned to their task to find their fortunes had changed and they were able to obtain all the fish they needed. The statue is believed to be the work of Frei Agostino de Jesus, a monk residing in S√£o Paulo. The statue was originally housed at the home of Felipe Pedroso, one of the fisherman who found it. This became a popular site for visitors wishing to pray to the statue, leading Pedroso's family to build a small chapel to house the statue. This was replaced in 1734 by a larger chapel, and then in 1834 by the first basilica on the site. In 1955, with pilgrimage numbers still growing, the construction work began on the present building, in a site nearby. It has room for more than 30,000 people and is second in capacity after St Peter's Basilica. The old wooden chapel was originally built in 1745. The old shrine is a modest church in the colonial style built between 1834 and 1888. Since that time, pious worshippers have termed it as a basilica. Due to the following conflicting accounts on dates, the Vatican has enumerated the following recorded Papal documents: * Pope Leo XIII mentioned the Brazilian devotion to this image called \\"Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o Aparecida\\" prior to his death in 1903 * Pope Pius X granted a canonical coronation to this same image on 8 December 1904. * Pope Pius XI declared that same Marian title as the Patroness of Brazil through a papal bull signed on 16 July 1930, also witnessed and signed by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli. * Pope Paul VI granted its first Golden rose on 12 August 1967 * Pope John Paul II elevated and consecrated formally as a Basilica on 4 July 1980.https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1980/documents/hf_jp- ii_hom_19800704_aparecida-brazil_en.html New Basilica Old Basilica Facade Basilica Tower Original image of Our Lady of Aparecida in its permanent exhibit inside the Basilica Benedito Calixto Neto was the architect contracted for the design of the project and, in 1955, the construction of the new basilica started. The structure is in the Romanesque Revival style and takes the form of a Greek Cross with arms in length and in width. The dome is high and the tower reaches a height of . The basilica contains of space. The main church hall can accommodate 30,000 people, which can expand to 300,000 during external celebrations. The grounds contain a shopping mall, medical clinic, restaurants and a parking lot that can hold 4,000 buses and 6,000 cars. On 4 July 1980, Pope John Paul II consecrated the sanctuary under the name Our Lady of Aparecida while the building was still under construction. The feast day for Our Lady of Aparecida is 12 October. Pope Benedict XVI visited the Basilica of the Shrine of Aparecida on 12 May 2007, during his Apostolic Journey to Brazil on the occasion of the Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean. During his visit, the Pope awarded the Shrine a Golden Rose. On the occasion of World Youth Day, Pope Francis visited the basilica on 24 July 2013, celebrating mass there. Main pilgrimage center for the Catholic Church in Brazil, the National Shrine of Aparecida was recognized by the Vatican as the Archdiocesan Cathedral of Aparecida on 12 November 2016, being since then an official Bishop church. = Construction site = Basilia Interior Main Altar Cathedral Ceiling Original Image of Our Lady of Aparecida Also known as \\"Bas√≠lica Nova\\", it is built on the \\"Pitas\\" hill, had its earthwork started in 1952, and finished in 1954. It started to be built on November 11, 1955, by the North side, and went on to build the Bras√≠lia Tower, which had its metallic structure donated by the then president Juscelino Kubitschek. After the tower was finished, the works went to the central dome, then, in mid-1972, to the \\"Capela das Velas\\" and to the South side, then passing to the West and East, and the intermediate wings. There is a walkway, called \\"Passarela da F√©\\", which connects the old church and the new basilica to which it is 392 m long, where there are people in a sign of faith, who walk this stretch on their knees.  Honors  = Golden Rose = The Basilica of Aparecida received the \\"Golden Rose\\" in three times: * The first, by Pope Paul VI, in 1967, on the occasion of the 250th anniversary jubilee of the appearance of the image of Our Lady of Aparecida, with the delivery made on August 15 of that year. * The second was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI, on March 18, 2007, Domingo L√¶tare , and delivered on May 12 of the same year, on the occasion of his visit to Brazil. * The third was given by Pope Francis, on October 9, 2017, for the 300th anniversary of the appearance of the image.  Infrastructure  The National Sanctuary has a wide and complete network of infrastructure to receive many people during regular days and festivities. = Lost and found = The lost objects are forwarded to the Pastoral Secretariat or to the Information Center, where they can be claimed with prior consultation.

The series focuses on the work of DS Emma Scribbins (Lisa Faulkner) and DI Kate Ashurst (Caroline Catz), police detectives assigned to the murder squad of the fictional suburban English town of Middleford. In this capacity, they are supervised by DCI Jeremy Sullivan (Jeremy Sheffield). Filming for the series took place in Northwood and other locations in Northwest London. A second series was broadcast in 2005, but did not achieve the ratings of the first series, and the programme was subsequently axed by the network. Both series have since been released on DVD. In Japan and other regional territories, the series was renamed Ash and Scribbs. Critical reception Rupert Smith of The Guardian said of the second series premiere; \\"Dramas about murdered schoolgirls aren't usually my cup of gore, but this was played so much for laughs that I could almost forgive the opening scene of a terrified child running through a graveyard before meeting her killer's blade. Thereafter it spun cheerfully along as a tale of rural witchcraft, complete with a wise priest who kept a book about demonology on his lectern; I don't know what the Synod would have to say about that. There were hex dolls, blood rituals and quite a lot of firm naked flesh on display, which made Murder in Suburbia comfortingly like an ancient Hammer movie. Caroline Catz and Lisa Faulkner remained well-dressed and wisecracking throughout; more importantly, the show gave work to Clare Clifford, whom I worshipped as homely Shirley in Angels all those years ago.\\" Cast and characters =Regular cast and characters= * Caroline Catz as Detective Inspector Kate Ashurst (\\"Ash\\") * Lisa Faulkner as Detective Sergeant Emma Scribbins (\\"Scribbs\\") * Jeremy Sheffield as Detective Chief Inspector Jeremy Sullivan =Recurring cast and characters= * Glen Davies as Police Constable Tony Gallimore * Stuart Nurse as Doctor David Weatherall, Police Pathologist Episode list =Series 1 (2004)= =Series 2 (2005)= References External links * Category:2004 British television series debuts Category:2005 British television series endings Category:2000s British crime drama television series Category:2000s British mystery television series Category:2000s British police procedural television series Category:2000s British workplace drama television series Category:British detective television series Category:Carlton Television Category:English-language television shows Category:ITV crime dramas Category:ITV mystery shows Category:Murder in television Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows set in London ","title":"Murder in Suburbia"},{"id":"9855651","text":"\\"The Way Station\\" is a novella by American writer Stephen King, originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in April 1980. In 1982, \\"The Way Station\\" was collected with several other stories King published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction as The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. \\"The Way Station\\" formed the second chapter of the book, and was slightly revised for the inclusion. Plot summary At a way station in the desert, Roland Deschain meets Jake Chambers for the first time. Under hypnosis, Jake remembers that he has recently been killed in his own world, the New York City of 1977, when someone pushed him into traffic. This event creates the series' first link of Roland's world to ours, and Jake's account leads Roland to believe that the man in black may have caused the death. While searching the way station's cellar for usable supplies, Roland encounters a demon that speaks to him through a skeleton buried behind the wall. The demon warns him that the man in black will be able to use Jake as an asset against him as long as the two are traveling together. On impulse, Roland takes the skeleton's jawbone with him. Roland and Jake set off into the desert, heading toward a mountain range where the man in black has gone. Along the way, Roland tells Jake about a training session under the severe regimen of his teacher Cort, who showed him how to use a hawk as a weapon; and how Roland and one of his best friends, Cuthbert Allgood, exposed the cook Hax as a traitor working for the Good Man and sent him to the gallows. Among other changes made by King for the 2003 revised version of The Gunslinger, King altered the \\"Rain in Spain\\" nursery rhyme included in the opening pages.

Wrestlingworth incorporates the hamlet of Water End, some half mile to the south of the village centre. At the 2011 census date it had a population of 591. It is in the civil parish of Wrestlingworth and Cockayne Hatley. It serves as a commuter village for Cambridge, Stevenage and London. Amenities in the village include a pre-school group and a Church of England VC Lower School. Wrestlingworth has a number of listed buildings including the Church of St Peter, and the centre of the village is a Conservation Area. Community groups in the village often meet at the Grade I listed 17th-century pub, The Chequers. These include the local Women's Institute, the Goodwill Fund, the Walking and Wildlife Group, The Bowls Club and the Pre-School support group. Geography Wrestlingworth lies east south-east of Potton and south-west of Cambridge. The eastern parish boundary borders Cambridgeshire. Elevation The village centre is above sea level. The land falls to in the south-east corner of the parish. The highest point is in Cockayne Hatley Wood at . Landscape Natural England has designated the area as part of The Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands (NCA 88). Central Bedfordshire Council has classified the landscape as Dunton Clay Vale. Not technically a 'vale', it is used here to mean a transitional landscape between a valley and a plateau. Medium to large fields of cereal crops dominate. The limited woodland cover and incomplete or unhedged roads reveal an open, undulating landscape. Former hedgerow lines are marked in places by trees. Geology, soil type and land use The majority of the parish is arable farmland but there are also a number of paddocks for horses, cattle and sheep grazing. Most of the parish lies on boulder clay but there is a small strip of gault running through Wrestlingworth village centre. The whole parish has highly fertile lime-rich loamy and clayey soils with slightly impeded drainage. Lousy Bush, a small nature reserve is at a former gravel pit to the south-west of the village. It is registered as common land and owned by the Parish Council. The night sky and light pollution Light pollution is the level of radiance (night lights) shining up into the night sky. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Wrestlingworth is in bands 3 and 4 with darker sky surrounding, particularly looking north-east. Public footpaths and bridleways A public footpath from Water End links with bridleways to Biggleswade via Lousy Bush, The Lodge, Dunton Fen, Sunderland Hall Farm and West Sunderland Farm. History Wrestlingworth is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. However, by the mid-12th century two manor houses ‚Äì Kendale's and Hereford's - are recorded as the village which was being established along the banks of a tributary of the River Cam. Historic names were Wrastlingewurde in the 12th century and Wrestlingforth in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Church of St. Peter was established in about 1300. Graves from the Great Plague are still clearly visible in St. Peter's churchyard, together with low set ‚Äòleper‚Äô windows. More information on the Lords of the Wrestlingworth Manors and St. Peter's Church can be found on the British History website. There used to be a post office/shop and a local convenience store but now there is just a hairdressers and a public house, The Chequers. =The last woman to be publicly hanged in England= In the 1840s, notoriety hit the village when the case of the murderer Sarah Dazley came to the fore. By the age of 25, Dazley had poisoned two husbands and a child. She was about to marry a third husband when villagers warned him of her past and subsequent investigations took place. These commenced with exhumation of the bodies and a Coroner's Inquest which was held in The Chequers Pub. Traces of arsenic were found and several local residents gave evidence against Dazley during her trial at Bedford Assizes.http://vcp.e2bn.org/case_studies/case11232-sarah-dazley-murder.html At the end of the case, Dazley was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged outside Bedford Gaol. She was the last woman to be publicly hanged in England and it is said that the entire Wrestlingworth community walked or rode over to Bedford to see the event. Governance Wrestlingworth & Cockayne Hatley Parish Council has seven elected members and meets bi-monthly at the Memorial Hall. Wrestlingworth is part of Potton ward for elections to the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority. Prior to 1894, Wrestlingworth was administered as part of the Hundred of Biggleswade. From 1894 until 1974 the village was in Biggleswade Rural District and from 1974 to 2009 in Mid Bedfordshire District. Wrestlingworth was in the Mid Bedfordshire parliamentary constituency until 1997. Now in North East Bedfordshire, the elected member is Richard Fuller of the Conservative Party.

It is the pricing and delivery point for the ICE Futures Europe (IntercontinentalExchange) natural gas futures contract. It is the 2nd most liquid gas trading point in Europe and is a major influence on the price that domestic consumers pay for their gas at home . Gas at the NBP trades in pence per therm. It is similar in concept to the Henry Hub in the United States ‚Äì but differs in that it is not an actual physical location.  Balance  Unlike continental European trading hubs such as Zeebrugge and TTF, trades made at the NBP are not required to be balanced, and there is no fixed penalty for being out of balance. Instead, shippers out of balance at the end of the day are automatically balanced through the 'cash-out' procedure whereby the shipper is automatically made to buy or sell the required quantity of gas to balance their position at the marginal system buy or sell price for that day. This cash out process is not considered to be a penalty in the same way as those imposed on shippers in continental markets, because the cash-out prices are often very close to the spot price. As a result of this daily market liquidity, the UK's NBP is frequently used to balance a shipper's position on the continent by way of the Bacton ‚Äì Zeebrugge interconnector.  National Grid plc  National Grid plc is the network operator (transmission system operator) in Great Britain. National Grid is responsible for the physical transportation of gas, as shippers are required only to nominate quantities entering and/or exiting the network, and not the transport route which the gas should physically follow. National Grid has the power to bring the system into balance, if shippers as a whole are out of balance. This is achieved by trading on the OCM (see below) and passing the cost onto gas shippers through the cash-out system. When the system is short of gas it tends to force prices at the NBP up. When the system is long gas, the price is forced down. This can provide an advantageous trading environment to a shipper which has flexible flow contracts.  OCM trading system  Trades at the NBP are made via the OCM trading system, an anonymous trading service managed by ICE ENDEXhttp://www.iceendex.com to which offers or requests for gas at a nominated price can be posted. The minimum amount of gas that may be traded on the OCM is 4,000 therms, so if a shipper's position is long or short by a volume less than 4,000 therms they may be forced simply to leave their balance to cash out.

History and architecture The building was designed as the town hall and incorporated a police station and several other municipal services. The structure was designed by the Bath architect Thomas Fuller in Bath stone, featuring Jacobean gables, an oriel window and an octagonal tower with an onion dome.Bradford-on-Avon website http://www.bradford-on-avon.org/ Fuller left England in 1845 for Antigua and then Canada, where he designed the Langevin Block of the Parliament of Canada, among other important commissions. Although the town was small, the hall represented Bradford-on-Avon's pride in its wool market. The complex was put on the market in the 1930s for ¬£3,000 and during the war years it hosted dances and film screenings. In 1974 the building was designated as Grade II listed.

The area is situated at the mouth of the island's longest valley called 'Wied il-Kbir'. The name Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq in Maltese can be translated to the meaning 'sea of pebbles' in English. It has a population of approximately 1250 people. History and facilities Baƒßar iƒã- ƒäagƒßaq is named after a long stretch of rocky coast characterised by a large number of pebbles and sharp rocks. The area was used as a camping site by British forces during the British colonial period of the islands. Two century- old chapels are found in the area, one of which has been abandoned. A modern central parish church and Franciscan retreat house are also located in the village. Opposite Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq is a marine entertainment centre which also has a dolphin show. Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq also contains a small number of bars and restaurants and a boy scout camping site. The village was for much of the late twentieth century home to the White Rocks tourist complex. However, by the early 21st century this had fallen into disrepair and was no longer used. A proposal to convert the complex into a sports complex was announced by the Maltese government in 2010, but little progress had been made by June 2011. When Local Councils were established it was decided by central government that the village should form part of the Local Council of Naxxar. However the parish district of the town falls under the neighbouring Gƒßargƒßur.

He began his education at Norwich University at Alden Partridge's military college in Norwich, Vermont and eventually transferred and graduated from Harvard in 1859 and in 1859‚Äì1860 was an instructor in chemistry there. Entering the Episcopal ministry, he was rector of All Saints Church, Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1862‚Äì1883 and of Grace Church, New York from 1883 until his death. Huntington always took a prominent part in public affairs. He was active in the movement for liturgical revisions and was secretary of the Prayer-Book Revisions Committee, and editor with Samuel Hart of the Standard Prayer-Book of 1892. Huntington died in Nahant, Massachusetts, in 1909.Armentrout, Don S. & Robert Boak Slocum (eds.) (2000) An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, New York: Church Publishing Incorporated, p. 257. Huntington was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1875.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Works The Chicago- Lambeth Quadrilateral had its genesis in an 1870 essay by Huntington. In The Church Idea, an Essay toward Unity Huntington's goal was to establish \\"a basis on which approach may be by God's blessing, made toward Home Reunion,\\" i.e., with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The Quadrilateral is a four- point articulation of Anglican identity, often cited as encapsulating the fundamentals of the Communion's doctrine and as a reference-point for ecumenical discussion with other Christian denominations. The four points are: #The Holy Scriptures, as containing all things necessary to salvation; #The Creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds), as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; #The dominical sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion; #The historic episcopate, locally adapted. The Quadrilateral has had a significant impact on Anglican identity since its passage by the Lambeth Conference. The Resolution came at a time of rapid expansion of the Anglican Communion, primarily in the territories of the British Empire. As such, it provided a basis for a shared ethos, one that became increasingly important as colonial churches influenced by British culture and values, evolved into national ones influenced by local norms.

It is the Officer cadet school of the Greek Army and the oldest third-level educational institution in Greece. It was founded in 1828 in Nafplio by Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor of the modern Greek state.  Overview  The institution was created to provide officers for all the Arms of the Hellenic Army (Infantry, Armour, Artillery, Signals, Engineering, and Army Aviation), as well as some of the Corps (the Technical Corps, the Transport and Supply Corps, and the Ordnance Corps). By contrast, officers in the Legal Corps, the Medical Corps, the Finance Corps, and the Auditing Corps are graduates of the Corps Officers Military Academy (Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπœâœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ£œáŒøŒªŒÆ ŒëŒæŒπœâŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ£œâŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ), with the exception of nurse officers in the Medical Corps, who are graduates of the Nurse Officer Academy (Œ£œáŒøŒªŒÆ ŒëŒæŒπœâŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒùŒøœÉŒ∑ŒªŒµœÖœÑœéŒΩ). The School also trains cadets on behalf of foreign allied countries. The origin of the designation \\"Evelpides\\" (Greek: Œï·ΩêŒ≠ŒªœÄŒπŒ¥ŒµœÇ, Eu√©lpides, literally: \\"bearers of high hopes\\") is from a passage by the historian Thucydides, where the Corinthians describe their adversaries, the Athenians, as \\"adventurous beyond their power, daring beyond their judgment, and bearers of high hopes when in danger\\" (History of the Peloponnesian War, Book I, 70). History The old building of the Academy in Kypseli, Athens Cadets in summer uniform and Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles, 1955 President of the Republic Konstantinos Karamanlis. The Hellenic Army Academy was founded in 1828 in Nafplion, the first capital of the modern Greek State. In 1834 the Academy was relocated to the island of Aegina, and in 1837, to the city of Piraeus. From 1854 to 1857 it was housed in the Duchess of Placentia Mansion in central Athens (now the Byzantine and Christian Museum). It was then relocated to Kypseli, Athens, in facilities donated by the magnate benefactor George Averoff. In 1982 the Academy was permanently established in Vari, a southeastern suburb of Athens. To celebrate the Academy's 150th anniversary (1828-1978), stamps featuring an officer cadet and a College building were printed in 1978. Throughout its long history, the Hellenic Army Academy has taken part in all national rallies and wars. Its presence surpassed the conventional character of a common Military School. Graduates of the Academy have been not only distinguished Army Officers, but also high level scientists, famous authors and the first civil engineers and professors of Physics and Mathematics, until the respective faculties in Greek Universities were founded. The first Hellenic Navy and Hellenic Air Force officers of the Balkan Wars came from the Academy as well. The Academy is a Highest Education Institution (University) and is overseen by the Ministry of National Defence. Education and training Academic education includes military and academic courses and covers up to 50% of the curriculum. Military training includes day and night field training. Subjects such as individual training and small infantry echelon exercises are held in co-operation with Corps of the Hellenic Army and other branches of the Armed Forces. Applied military tactics is a vital part of the overall training of Cadets covering 38% of the curriculum. Physical training covers 12% of the overall training and includes track and field events and various other sports. The Academy's mission is to train Cadets by offering education in various arts and sciences with a view to widen their general knowledge, offer them the required military training so that they are able to attend the Special Training Program of the Hellenic Army upon graduation, and to cultivate and develop military merits and attitude so that they acquire, to a high level as new Officers, the qualifications and skills necessary for becoming military leaders, with integrity of character, knowledge, and physical as well as mental endurance. High school graduates enrol in the Academy according to their scholastic performance in the nationwide University admission tests, and following successful completion of additional physical and mental testing. Successful applicants have been scoring better than 80% in recent years, with top applicants above the 95% mark. Studies in the Academy last for four years and, on graduation, cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants of the Hellenic Army.

It was invented and initially produced more than eight centuries ago by the monks of the abbey of Bellelay, located in the community of Saicourt, district of Moutier, in the mountainous zone of the Bernese Jura, the French-speaking area of the Canton of Bern. Traditionally, the cheese is prepared for eating in an unusual way: the cheese is carefully scraped with a knife to produce thin shavings, which is said to help develop the odour and flavour by allowing oxygen to reach more of the surface. There are two explanations for the origin of the name T√™te de Moine, which translates literally as \\"monk's head\\". The name was first documented in the records of Mont-Terrible, a Department established by the French when they annexed the region from 1793 to 1799 at the time of the French Revolution. The first theory is that it is a mocking name bestowed by French occupation soldiers who compared the method of serving the cheese to shaving the top of a skull to create a monk‚Äôs tonsure. The second explanation is based on tales from the Jura region which refer to the number of cheeses stored at the cloister \\"per tonsure\\", or per resident monk. Texts from as far back as 1192 attest to the cheese-making skill of the monks of Bellelay. Over time, the T√™te de Moine was used by tenant farmers as payment to land owners, as well as figuring in legal settlements, being offered as a gift to the prince-bishops of Basel, and even serving as currency. T√™te de Moine is made from unpasteurized, whole cow's milk and is a semi-hard cheese. It is cylindrical in shape, with a height typically equal to 70 to 100% of its diameter. The average weight of a T√™te de Moine is 850 g, but some specimens can weigh as much as 2.5 kg. It is aged for a minimum of 2¬Ω months on a small spruce plank, and is typically paired with a dry, white wine. Since May 2001, T√™te de Moine has had appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) status. In 2013, it was replaced by the appellation d‚Äôorigine prot√©g√©e (AOP) certification. Exported throughout the world, it is the calling card of the cheese-making tradition of the Swiss Jura. It is currently produced by fewer than 10 cheese dairies of the Jura Mountains area of Porrentruy, District of Franches-Montagnes, both situated in the Canton of Jura, as well as in Moutier and Courtelary, in the Bernese Jura. In 1982 the girolle was invented, an apparatus which makes it possible to make \\"rosettes\\" of T√™te de Moine by turning a scraper on an axle planted in the center of the cheese. This apparatus helped to boost the consumption of this cheese.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, and Toronto Blue Jays. Career =Third baseman= Johnson was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent third baseman in . He batted .248 for their Western Carolina League affiliate, the Salisbury Braves in 1962, and committed seven errors in only 29 games for a .868 fielding percentage. He batted .238 with an .872 fielding percentage in , and the Mets began experimenting with him on the mound. He made eleven pitching appearances for the California League's Salinas Mets that season, and had a 6.75 earned run average without a decision. With an .870 fielding percentage in , the notion of Johnson as a third baseman was abandoned, and he was converted to a pitcher for good by the New York‚ÄìPenn League's Auburn Mets. He pitched in the Mets' minor league system through . Following the season, he was obtained by the Philadelphia Phillies from the Mets in the 1967 minor league draft. =Philadelphia Phillies= Johnson made his major league debut on July 17, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park. He gave up two earned runs in one inning of the Phillies' 8-4 loss. =Curt Flood trade= Johnson spent two years with Philadelphia, before moving to the St. Louis Cardinals in a controversial transaction. On October 7, , he was sent by Philadelphia along with Dick Allen and Cookie Rojas to the St. Louis Cardinals in the same trade that brought Tim McCarver, Byron Browne, Joe Horner and Curt Flood to the Phillies. After Flood refused to report to his new team, St. Louis sent Willie Monta√±ez and a minor leaguer to Philadelphia to complete the trade. Flood believed that Major League Baseball's reserve clause was unfair and appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although his legal challenge was unsuccessful, it brought solidarity among ballplayers as they fought against reserve clause and sought free agency. =San Francisco Giants= He was 2-0 with a 3.18 ERA for the Cards when they dealt him mid-season to the San Francisco Giants for Frank Linzy. With the Giants, Johnson emerged as one of the top relievers in the National League, finishing sixth in Cy Young Award balloting during an era when such an honor was rare for relief pitchers. In , Johnson went 12-9 with a 2.97 ERA and eighteen saves for the division winning Giants. In his only post- season, he pitched 1.1 innings and gave up two runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates in game four of the 1971 National League Championship Series. =Later career= During Spring training , Johnson was selected off waivers by the Cleveland Indians. After one season in the American League, he was traded to the Houston Astros for Cecil Upshaw. He was released by the Astros at the end of the season, and signed with the San Diego Padres in . After two seasons in San Diego, he was traded to the newly created Toronto Blue Jays for Dave Roberts, who had just been purchased by the Jays from the Padres. Johnson was the winning pitcher (as a reliever) in the Blue Jays' first-ever game on April 7, 1977. Johnson went 2-4 with a 4.60 ERA in the Blue Jays' inaugural season, at the end of which he retired. Following his majors career, Johnson played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.

In 1999 and 2000, Cassidy & Associates was led all lobbying firms in reported income.  History  Beginning in 2004, the firm represented Equatorial Guinean president Teodoro Obiang, \\"one of Africa's most notorious dictators\\". According to the United States Department of Justice the president paid Cassidy & Associates at least $120,000 per month. Mother Jones has described the agency as almost \\"a shadow foreign ministry\\" for the country.

In 2015, the firm's founder and namesake, Gerald S. J. Cassidy, stepped down after 38 years of leading the firm. The firm reported earning $12.85 million in 2015, according to records filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) with the Secretary of the U.S. Senate and Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the firm had been hired by the Egyptian intelligence services. In late February, the U.S. State Department cataloged human rights abuses in Egypt in its annual report. The Egyptian government hired Cassidy & Associates and its parent company Weber Shandwick to improve Egypt's image in the United States.

Its history dates back to the 18th century in the Kingdom of Prussia during the Seven Years' War and War of the Bavarian Succession and has existed ever since in different forms and shapes. WW I - Feldpost - FELDPOSTEXPEDITION der 32 Div. 64 Inf. Brig. XII. (K. S.) - Dresden - vom 3.2.1915 History =World War II= During 1937-39, the German Wehrmacht had a military mailing service that provided free postal services within Germany. On September 3, 1939, the first changes to the service occurred. Postcards and letters up to 250 g including newspapers could be mailed free of charge by the German para-military and military organizations. Later in 1939, packages weighing up to 1000 g were included at the nominal rate of 20 Reichspfennig fee. All German military branches had its own organic postal administration in charge of receiving and delivering mail. For Feldpost offices closest to the combat zone a mobile facility usually processed mail for all military branches. In 1940 further changes were introduced followed through the rapid conquest of Europe. Eventually a series of postal agreements were set up between Germany and the occupied countries providing an extended usage of Feldpost service. Countries such as the Netherlands had close to 50,000 pro-Nazi volunteers that during the course of the war used the Feldpost service. Eventually these postal agreements were settled between Germany and other countries, including neutral countries such as Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Turkey, which had volunteers within the German forces. cover with battalion code number 03498/L To preserve the secrecy of troop movements, each battalion was assigned a five digit code number called Feldpost number (FPN). By the end of 1939, letter prefixes \\"L\\" and \\"M\\" were attached in front of each FPN to units belonging to the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. A breakdown by military units was added by attaching letter prefixes \\"A\\" through \\"E\\" at the end of each FPN. The letter A generally signified headquarters company, the others stood for line companies. The sequence of an FPN does not necessarily mean that the location of the units were at the same area. The postal cover/postcard itself was usually stamped with a military Feldpost Cancellation and Official Military Unit Seal. Feldpost numbers were sometimes reassigned to other units, particularly when a unit ceased to exist. Normally Feldpost mail could not be dispatched nor received by civil post offices. If a soldier wanted to send mail through a civil post office, full postage was collected.

He was a major inspiration behind the fictionalized novel F. L. Vƒõk (1906) by Alois Jir√°sek. Biography Hek was the son of a shopkeeper (of Dutch origin) from Dobru≈°ka. He received his primary education in Dobru≈°ka and in Prague (from 1779) and from 1782 he studied at a Piarists gymnasium in Prague. In Prague, Hek met the Czech patriots concentrated around V√°clav Matƒõj Kramerius' publishing house ƒåesk√° expedice and around the Czech theatre groups. In the second half of the 1780s, he returned to Dobru≈°ka to take over his father's shop. Hek also served as a local agent for Kramerius, loaned books from his large personal library (3,284 volumes in 1806) and tried to organize a local Czech theatre, which was forbidden by authorities. A fire in 1806 completely destroyed his shop and he lost money during the state bankruptcy of the Austrian Empire in 1811. From 1806, he cooperated with Josef Liboslav Ziegler (1782‚Äì1846), a patriotic priest. In 1821, his wife died and he retired. Hek then lived, among other places, in the Saxonian town of Herrnhut (), a center of Czech Evangelical exile, and for the last years of his life in Ky≈°perk (today Letohrad) with his daughter. The historical novel F.L. Vƒõk by Alois Jir√°sek is based on Hek's life, as described in his autobiography. A television series, F.L. Vƒõk, was shot in 1971. The City Museum of Dobru≈°ka owns Hek's birth house, and has hosted an exhibition about Hek in the building since 1972. Dobru≈°ka's main square was named after F.L. Vƒõk. Work The majority of the Hek's works were published after 1806; the 1820s were his most active period. The most important were his satirical epigrams. In 1820, he published book of epigrams Velk√Ω p√°tek (), a scathing critique of provincialism in Dobru≈°ka. An example of his epigrams is: \\"The greater the fool, the more titles he needs\\" (). Predictably, the work was banned and confiscated, and only two original copies are known today. Hek was sentenced to three weeks in prison, though he was pardoned due to bad health, and was harassed by authorities in Dobru≈°ka ever thereafter. While living in Ochranov (Herrnhut), he translated old texts of Czech exiles into German. His best known music works were composed during the 1830‚Äì40s. Hek also wrote his own autobiography in German. Literature * Jan Jakubec: Dƒõjiny literatury ƒçesk√© (History of Czech Literature), volume I 1929, volume II 1934. * Alois Jir√°sek: F.L.

It is found in the northern Pacific Ocean, from Russia to Alaska and as far south as Monterey Bay. It is a distinctly red fish, with brown, yellow, white, and black mottling, that is generally around long, though specimens can grow to up to in length. German naturalist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius formally described it in 1811. Carnivorous, it hides camouflaged among rocks on the ocean floor and lashes out to seize its prey‚Äîcrabs, fish and shrimp. Taxonomy German naturalist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius formally described the red Irish lord in 1811 as Cottus hemilepidotus, from material collected off Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Kamchatka Peninsula. The species (and genus) name is derived from the Ancient Greek words hemi \\"half\\", lepis \\"scale\\", and ous, otis \\"ear\\". The genus was erected in 1829 by French zoologist Georges Cuvier in the second edition of his work Le R√®gne Animal. Prussian naturalist Peter Simon Pallas described the same species as Cottus trachurus in 1814. No subspecies are recognised and there is little geographic variation across its range. Description The red Irish lord grows to an average length of about , with a maximum recorded length of , and a maximum recorded weight of . As with most sculpins, it is only partially scaled and has a broad head and large eyes, with a slimmer body. Red Irish lords are also characterized by a dorsal fin separated into three notches, with an average of 10 to 12 dorsal spines, and 18‚Äì20 dorsal soft rays. It possesses several bands of scales along its body, the dorsal band being about 4‚Äì5 scales wide, with another band below the lateral line that is about 10 scales wide. However, there are no scales on its underside. It features frontal cirri of 4‚Äì8 barbels, and nasal cirri of 4‚Äì8 barbels, while lacking fleshy flaps on its nostrils. It has 35 vertebrae. The red Irish lord can be identified by its namesake red coloration, which can also contain brown, white, and black mottling. It is generally darker above and paler to almost white below. Spotting and mottling is more prominent in larger fish, and always visible on specimens over long. The pectoral and anal fins are mottled. The pelvic fins are pale, but are spotted or dark in large males. It can also change color to blend in with its surroundings. The similar brown Irish lord has a dorsal band that is 6‚Äì8 (rather than 4‚Äì5) scales wide, while the yellow Irish lord has more slender cirri.  Distribution and habitat  The red Irish lord lives in temperate, demersal marine environments between 66¬∞N and 34¬∞N. They are found mostly along the coastal waters of the Northern Pacific Ocean, from the Bering Sea in Russia, to Alaska, to the Western coast of the U.S. as far as Monterey Bay in California, although rare that far south. Red Irish lords are sculpins, and therefore benthic, bottom-dwelling fish that inhabit mostly shallow waters, but can live at deeper depths. They prefer a coastal, rocky habitat in reefs and shallow areas in the intertidal zone up to about in depth, but their distribution can range all the way up to . Their hunting strategy and camouflaged coloration lend themselves to hiding at the sea floor among sand, rocks and other marine life, while waiting to ambush prey. They are not harmful to humans.  Diet and behavior  The red Irish lord is a carnivorous ambush predator, using its camouflage to blend in with the ocean floor, where it sits motionless and waits to strike at passing prey. Living mostly on the bottom, its main food sources are crabs, small fish, shrimp, mussels, and barnacles. Like many other sculpins, it tends to hide within rock crevices, strike out for food and quickly resume its position. They are typically discarded by commercial fisheries. The red Irish lord is preyed upon by the North American river otter.  Life cycle  Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus is a non-migratory species. Its life cycle consists of five stages of development: egg, larvae, pre-juvenile, juvenile, and the adult stage. While the red Irish lord exhibits primarily maternal guarding of young, males have been shown to build and guard nests into which the females then lay eggs. The eggs are laid in a mass between October and January, the guarding fish retreating with low tide. Juveniles typically live in tide pools for some period of time.
