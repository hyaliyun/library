The building is a parallelogram with a 120 ft. of frontage on Center St. with a depth of 80 ft. The height to the eaves of the roof is 48 ft. Eighty thousand pressed bricks made by H & G Evans of Philadelphia were used to construct the outer walls, and 20,000 bricks were made onsite for the inner walls. The mansard slate roof has porthole dormers and elaborate chimneys and a decorative bracketed cornice. The central pavilion has flanking pilasters supporting a classic portico. A 1923 renovation added an elevator, three new wings, each with a courtroom, and a rotunda with an elaborate glass dome joining the wings. Courtroom 1 was added at this time. It is one of the largest courtrooms in the United States, with 500 seats. A second renovation was completed in 1995. Twenty-six portraits of county judges grace the building, many of which were painted in the 1920s and 1930s by Mr. and Mrs. Vale. Two 1930 murals, Knowledge and Justice were restored in 1994.

Early life and education Cancellieri was born in Rome on 22 October 1943. She studied political science at the University of Rome. Career Cancellieri worked for the ministry of interior beginning in 1972. She then worked as a Prefetto (prefect) in Bologna, Vicenza, Bergamo, Brescia, Catania and Genova. She retired from the provincial-level government representation. She was subsequently appointed special commissioner of the municipalities of Bologna (in February 2010) and of Parma (in October 2011), temporarily taking over from the mayors in the wake of political scandals. She was appointed minister of interior on 16 November 2011, and was one of the technocrats in the Monti cabinet. Her term in the Monti cabinet ended on 27 April 2013 when Enrico Letta announced that she would serve as justice minister in his cabinet. The following day her tenure as justice minister began and she replaced Paola Severino in the post. Andrea Orlando replaced her in the post in February 2014 when the Renzi cabinet was formed.  Italian court reform  In 2013, Cancellieri and Letta's government went ahead with Severino's (and Monti government's) reform of Italian courts initially planned in 2012. This overdue reform was deemed necessary by a number of people in order to streamline the functioning of some of the State's courts and was part of an effort by the Italian authorities to reduce the spending of public money. However, some harsh debate arose as cases occurred in which Cancellieri ordered to close efficient courts (e.g. the court of Bassano del Grappa, one of the quickest in Italy) merging them with slower, less efficient courts. The decree was also passed in contrast to the requests of various authorities of Bassano and Veneto, and even in contrast to the Italian Parliament's official stand. The closing of the court of Bassano was later confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Italy with the reason that \\"the courts of Bassano and Belluno could not be balanced within the same province...\\" despite the fact that Bassano and Belluno are not in the same province and the Court's judgement was thus based on a false premise.

The company focused on offering short-term, high-cost loans to customers via online applications, and began processing its first loans in 2007. The firm operated across several countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland and South Africa; it also operated in Canada until 2016, and in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands through the German payments business, BillPay, between 2013 to 2017. The company was responsible for inventing fully automated risk processing technology to provide short-term, unsecured personal loans online, including via tablet and mobile app.However, it also drew wide criticism from amongst politicians, charities and religious leaders, for the interest it charged, equated to an annual percentage rate (APR) of 1,509%; an example of this was that a loan of ¬£100 over seventeen days (Wonga's average loan term) required ¬£113.60 to repay. The company was criticised heavily by politicians, including the Labour Party leader Ed Miliband as a leading example of predatory lending.Ed Miliband Takes On The 'Wonga Economy' Sky News, 5 November 2013. Retrieved 7 November 2013. The firm's debt collection practices were also scrutinised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who found the firm had lent money to many who would never be able to repay and Wonga agreed to compensate 45,000 customers for unfair and misleading debt collection practices.https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/wonga-pay-redress-unfair- debt-collection-practices By 2015, the company began to incur losses, which were further increased by discontinuation of sponsorship deals, a data breach in 2017, and a surge of customer compensation claims. Despite an emergency cash injection from shareholders to prevent it becoming insolvent, the firm fell into administration on 30 August 2018, with Grant Thornton appointed to wind down the business, sell assets and identify creditors. By March 2019, administrators noted that compensation claims against the firm increased, but with many claimants unlikely to receive the full value of their claim.  History  Founding and growth Wonga was co-founded by Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz in October 2006, who derived the name from the Romany slang term for money that was in use in some parts of Britain since the 1980s.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. The plan for the company was to disrupt the short- term credit industry with a new branch of lender that provided transparency, exact control of amount and payment date, and immediate access to funds to customers, without hassling them through faxing or emailing documents. Although both men had previous experience in internet start-up operations, neither Damelin or Hurwitz had any within retail banking, which presented a problem when seeking out funding, as many potential investors they aproached perceived the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The company's first year was spent on software development for a beta website. The business model of lending only to those who could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans, required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner ‚Äì something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. In addition, Damelin and Hurwitz required the co-operation of leading banks to help get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, by convincing them that customer identity could be provided without physical documentation, a factor in their plan that banks were uncertain with. A beta website was eventually finalised and launched in 2007, and within five minutes, Wonga was processing its first loan application; within a week, the firm faced its first loan default. The subsequent months of operation showed increased demand, but traditional methods of credit risk assessment proved inadequate, leading the company to experience default rates of around 50%. During the first year of operations, the company used this period to gather data on customer behaviour in order to develop their own proprietary risk technology. The full market launch of Wonga.com was officially made in July 2008, and within a year it had processed around 100,000 loans. Through the experience of processing these loans, the company developed technologies which began to dramatically reduce the percentage of defaults. In July 2009 Wonga raised a further ¬£13.9m of funding in a Round B led by Accel Partners, Greylock Partners and Dawn Capital. In 2009 the company was already profitable and default rates were below 10%, less than the average for credit cards. A third round of funding was completed in 2011, for ¬£73m led by Oak Investment Partners including additional investors Meritech Capital Partners and the Wellcome Trust. By the end of 2011, Wonga's technology could reliably reject two-thirds of applications and predict the ability of a customer to repay a loan by an accuracy of around 93%. In May 2012, the firm expanded into South Africa, offering consumer loans, and began testing their technology in November that year for a possible expansion into Canada. Decline and collapse On 30 September 2014, Wonga announced that its profits for the previous year had fallen by 53% to ¬£39.7 million. The company blamed the cut in profits to \\"remediation costs\\" ‚Äì compensation paid to customers ‚Äì which in total cost the company ¬£18.8m, and predicted its profitablity would be reduced through new controls set out by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) from June of that year. Along with conforming to the new rules set out by the FCA, which limited roll-overs of loans and forced them to increase affordability checks, price caps were introduce from the start of 2015. The tougher regulations on the payday loan sector impacted the firm significantly, doubling its loss as its UK consumer base was greatly reduced; around almost 3.8 million of the 4 million loans it granted around that time were to UK customers. By the end of 2015, the company reported a pre-tax loss of ¬£80.2m for the year ‚Äì up from ¬£38.1m the year before . In April 2017, Wonga suffered a data breach which affected around 245,000 of its customers in the UK. The range of information stolen in the breach included details on customers' bank cards ‚Äì information used by some banks as part of the login process for online accounts. On 4 August 2018, the company received an emergency ¬£10m cash injection from shareholders after its chief executive warned it was in danger of becoming insolvent due to a surge in customer compensation claims. On 26 August, Grant Thornton were lined up to act as administrators in the event Wonga becomes insolvent, pending a decision to be made within weeks, and assumed their responsibilities the day after the firm went into administration on 30 August. Grant Thornton focused on conducting a wind-down of the business that would involve the sale of assets and identifying creditors, along with handling claims for compensation. By March 2019, the administrators informed the Treasury Select Committee that the number of claims had increased fourfold - increasing from around 10,500 to over 40,000 - since the firm's collapse, but that the lack of assets and the sheer volume meant that many claimants ‚Äî denoted as unsecured creditors ‚Äî were likely to receive much less than they were entitled to. By January 2020, the number of claimants was 358,000. They will share around ¬£23m in compensation, around 4.3% of what they were owed.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/30/wonga-claimants-to-get- just-43-payout-for-mis-sold-loans Ownership and corporate structure Over 180 million shares of the company are owned by venture capital firms, around 77.1%. The balance of the company is owned by staff, board members and founders with Errol Damelin owning 26.5m shares through Castle Bridge Ventures, an offshore trust based in the British Virgin Islands, while Jonty Hurwitz owns 12.6m shares (around 5.5%) through a BVI company.\\"Wonga sets ¬£1.2bn target\\" by Simon Duke in The Sunday Times, Business section, 10 November 2013, p. 2.

Customer profile Wonga claims that its customers are \\"tech-savvy young professionals who previously used the banks to borrow money\\". It accepts that its APR is \\"not cheap\\" but claims that its typical customer is on a mid-level salary and is temporarily short of cash because of an unexpected bill, for example to buy a new central heating boiler or tickets to a music festival. Dr Gathergood of the University of Nottingham described payday loan users as falling into two groups, those who have had a financial shock but can repay the money and those who were unable to control their expenditure, though he said lenders preferentially associated their clients with the first group. The committee also looked at credit unions. Mark Lyonette of Association of British Credit Unions said that although credit unions now provided 90 million loans in the United States, they were not able to match the \\"sophisticated automation and credit scoring behind the scenes\\" of the \\"high-tech, payday-lending Wonga model\\", though he welcomed the possibility of using post offices as a vehicle to expand the Credit Union market in the UK. Wonga has said that most applicants are not credit-worthy enough to obtain a loan from the firm, but it only lends to those with a good credit record. Some commentators, however, have warned that taking a loan from a payday lender can damage the customer's credit record and their ability to obtain a mortgage, even where the loan was repaid years ago. Ray Boulger of John Charcol, for instance, told BBC Newsnight that \\"Our experience is that mortgage lenders will often turn down requests for people who have had a payday loan...\\",Wonga boss answers Newsbeat listeners' questions BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, 5 November 2013. Retrieved 7 November 2013. and Robert Sinclair, Chief Executive of the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries, said \\"From a consumer perspective, anybody who takes out a payday loan is clearly showing some financial distress and existing lenders will think these consumers may be maxed out.\\"Payday loans spell trouble for mortgage applications by Devraj Ray in Moneymarketing.co.uk, 17 November 2013. Retrieved 23 November 2013. Archived here. Defaults and renewal of loans Screenshot from Wonga.com, 3 February 2014, showing the costs of a loan. Wonga states that if the money is not available on the day a customer has nominated to pay it back, a ¬£30 fee will be charged and interest will accrue for a maximum of 60 days and does not allow automatic \\"rolling over\\" of loans, limiting to specific requests and to a maximum of three instances in accordance with the Finance and Leasing Association lending code. On 28 November 2012, following concerns that small loans, intended to be short-term, could become prohibitively expensive, the government announced it would give the Financial Conduct Authority powers to prevent indefinite rolling over of loans and effectively limit charges. In August 2018, the company announced that it would not be offering more loans because of the critical financial situation of the company. However, it decided to only entertain their existing clients. Sponsorship and public relations Footballer Papiss Ciss√© of Newcastle United in a Wonga sponsored shirt. Wonga sponsored free travel on the London Underground on New Year's Eve in 2010, and posters were put up on the network advertising the website with the slogan \\"sometimes you need some extra cash\\". A member of the London Assembly said that it was 'shameful' that the Mayor of London had allowed such sponsorship at a time of year when people are most vulnerable financially. Media Week noted that the deal was \\"highly criticised\\" and that Transport for London later banned payday loan companies from sponsoring their services. In August 2012 the company launched OpenWonga, an online \\"digital platform that aims to 'inform the debate' around the brand\\". In October 2012 Wonga announced that they were sponsoring the football team Newcastle United for ¬£8 million a year. Several MPs spoke out against the deal and the leader of Newcastle City Council told The Guardian he was \\"appalled and sickened\\" that the club had signed a deal with \\"a legal loan shark\\" and in July 2013 Papiss Ciss√© refused to wear the kit, citing religious reasons as a practising Muslim despite \\"pictures ... of him gambling in a casino\\". The sponsorship was not renewed after the 2016‚Äì17 season.Newcastle United sponsor revealed as Chinese gaming firm In 2012, Wonga.com sponsored ITV's Red or Black?, which was widely criticised.

In 2013, an Irish subsidiary of Wonga patented \\"user authentication software\\", telling Corporate Watch that \\"it is common practice for international groups to consolidate their IP holdings in a location where the substantial activity relating to the IP is performed.\\" Richard Murphy from Tax Research UK commented that \\"the transfer of key business processes ‚Äì especially those that are technology based and that can be protected by patents and copyrights ‚Äì is a classic way in which companies try to move their profits between countries.\\" Debt collection practices In May 2012, the company was required by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to improve its debt collection practices, after it was found that it had sent letters to customers in 2010 accusing them of committing fraud and saying that the police might be informed. Telephone scripts used by Wonga warned borrowers working in the public or financial sectors that their terms of employment said they should not be in debt. Wonga appealed the decision and said it believed it had grounds for suspecting dishonest conduct by the specific customers to whom letters had been sent, and that they had been sent on isolated occasions more than 18 months previously and had not been sent since. It stated that it had put in place procedures to make sure similar problems did not occur in future, and that since then it referred cases of suspected fraud to an in-house team to investigate. The phone scripts had not been used since January 2010, it said. In November 2013, after being challenged repeatedly by members of Parliament in a Business, Innovation and Skills select committee hearing on pay day lenders, Wonga said that they had not been censured by the OFT, but had been asked to make various changes, and that criticism by the OFT was \\"an open issue\\"; the company could not say more on an ongoing process. The practice of allowing debtors to \\"roll on\\" an existing loan was also called into question by the MPs. Regulation for the consumer credit industry passed from the OFT to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) from April 2014. In June 2014, the FCA found that Wonga's debt collection practices were unfair and ordered that they compensate affected customers. The FCA found that between October 2008 and November 2010, Wonga had sent their customers letters purporting to be from non-existent law firms \\"Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon\\" and \\"Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries\\", described as \\"fake\\" in reports, to collect money from them. In some cases, customers were charged for the supposed lawyers' fees for these letters; Labour MP Stella Creasy asked why the police were not investigating. This practice had been uncovered by the OFT in 2011, after Wonga was asked to disclose information about its debt collection practices.Jones, Rupert (25 June 2014) \\"Wonga to pay ¬£2.6m compensation for fake debt firm letters\\", The Guardian, Retrieved 25 June 2014 \\"Wonga's misconduct was very serious because it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears,\\" said Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA. He added: \\"The FCA expects firms to pay particular attention to fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting their loan repayments\\". Richard Lloyd of Which? described the findings as \\"a shocking new low for the payday industry that is already dogged by bad practice and Wonga deserves to have the book thrown at it.\\" Wonga UK managing director, Tessa Cook, said: \\"Today is not a proud day for Wonga and I'd like to apologise\\". As the misconduct happened before the FCA took over the regulation of payday lenders, it is unable to fine Wonga. It also said there would be no criminal investigation as it wanted to set up a compensation scheme (of about ¬£2.6 million) as quickly as possible and a criminal probe would take time. However, the issue was later passed onto the police for potential criminal investigation. The head of the Law Society, Desmond Hudson, said that Wonga's activity, which he qualified as dishonest, could amount to blackmail, deception, and other breaches of the law. The City of London Police began reassessing the case for an investigation, but announced the following year that after a thorough review of all the material gathered, that there was insufficient evidence to progress an investigation. Consequent to discussions with the FCA, on 2 October 2014 Wonga agreed to write off the debts ‚Äì thought to total ¬£220m ‚Äì of 330,000 customers who were in arrears of thirty days or more. Church of England Justin Welby has been critical of Wonga. In May 2012, Justin Welby (then the Bishop of Durham) called Wonga.com's high interest rates \\"shocking\\" and \\"usurious\\". Wonga declined to comment. By July 2013, Welby was Archbishop of Canterbury and had been a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. He announced that he had had a \\"good conversation\\" with Errol Damelin and told him that he wanted to see competition, not legislation, put Wonga out of business. According to the BBC the church would help credit unions by providing premises and expertise. However Welby was reported to be furious when the Financial Times pointed out that, despite denying involvement in payday lending, the Church Pension fund invested in venture capitalists Accel Partners which raised funds for Wonga in 2009. In a November 2013 interview for ITV, Niall Wass defended the firm's practices and challenged critics to \\"go use the service, see if you think it is fair and transparent, take out ¬£30 for ten days, pay it back after a week, look at the price, tell me if that is fair and transparent.\\"Archbishop of Canterbury 'should try Wonga', boss urges. Interview with Niall Wass by Laura Kuenssberg, ITV, 4 November 2013. Archived here. By July 2014, The Church of England had severed its ties with the payday lender. Politicians An all-party Early Day Motion tabled in November 2011 highlighted Wonga's \\"high APR\\" and sought to restrict the level of interest that can be charged on all loans by financial institutions. British MP Stella Creasy has also proposed legislation for interest rate caps. A Policis report on proposed interest rate capping said it would cause an exit from the market and those with access to the credit mainstream would be diverted to products such as overdrafts and revolving credit that could be higher cost than high APR products and those without access to credit would be diverted to the black credit market. The Times said capping will further limit the availability of credit to people from regulated entities. On 20 November 2012, Creasy demanded an apology from the company after The Guardian reported that abusive tweets were sent to her by Wonga employees. Further investigation of the Creasy case showed that computers registered to Wonga.com's London office were used to abuse Creasy over Twitter, and delete criticism, as well as the reference to \\"usury\\" from the English Wikipedia's Wonga.com page. Wonga.com admitted that a \\"junior employee\\" may have sent the tweets and defended what it regards as its right to correct \\"inaccurate\\" Wikipedia articles, though Wikipedia policy on conflict of interest says such edits are \\"strongly discouraged.\\"\\"MP demands apology after abusive tweets are traced to Wonga employee\\".

He accused Wonga and other payday lenders of 'targeting children'. In 2018, once the company had gone into administration, chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee Frank Field wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in a letter urging the Archbishop to lead a consortium with Wonga's administrators and for the Church of England to purchase the company's loans, preventing the company from selling its loans on to debt recovery businesses at \\"knockdown rates\\". APR and the cost of a loan Screenshot from Wonga.com showing the cost of borrowing ¬£100 for 30 days on 17 November 2013. The firm claims its loans are often cheaper than unauthorised bank charges and although APR disclosure is mandatory, it is a poor comparison measure for short term loans. The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee heard evidence from consumer money expert Martin Lewis that the total cost of a payday loan was more useful than APR. Lewis calculated in his blog that at a compounding interest rate of 4,212%, a ¬£100 loan that is not repaid would in seven years amount to more than the USA's entire national debt, however, he explained that his calculation \\"bears little resemblance to reality\\", because Wonga does not charge compound interest. He also explained that he had performed this calculation purely to raise awareness of the risks of payday loans and concluded by expressing the hope that his example would make people \\"think twice before getting payday borrowing\\".Fact: borrowing ¬£100 at Wonga's APR costs more than the US national debt (over $14 trillion) after 7 years!

In April 2014, a loan shark in Manchester was jailed for illegal money lending and other offences despite claiming that his rates were lower than Wonga. His lawyer said: \\"Within his community there are large numbers of people who because of their debt history are very limited in terms of the places they can go, other than companies such as Wonga.\\" Loan shark jailed despite plea for mercy to judge saying his rates were better than Wonga.com by Chris Osuh, Manchester Evening News, 10 April 2014. Archived here. In October 2014, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga from using a TV advert that it said breached its code because of a claim that customers would save money. The authority said this was likely to be interpreted as a statement that Wonga's loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate.Osborne, Hilary (October 2014). \\"Wonga banned from using ad that didn't mention 5,853% interest rate\\", The Guardian, 8 October 2014. Retrieved 9 October 2014. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: \\"Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how much it will cost. The consequences are really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt... both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways\\".BBC News (October 2014). \\"Wonga TV ad banned for failing to show interest rate\\", BBC News, 8 October 2014.

It is considered to be partly autobiographical and tells the story of the protagonist, H√©l√®ne Karol, who shares much of N√©mirovsky's early history. Le Vin de solitude was originally published in France in 1935. Following the success of N√©mirovsky's posthumously published work Suite Fran√ßaise in 2004, it was translated and published in English in 2011. Plot Le Vin de solitude tells the story of a dysfunctional middle-class Jewish family living in Kiev in the Ukraine during the early years of the 20th century. The father comes from humble origins, but makes a fortune from banking in Imperial Russia. H√©l√®ne hates her vain mother, Bella, with an intense but well-hidden passion. As she grows into her teens, the rage increases, fed by her mother's criticisms, extravagance, and lavish, romantic life with her young lover, Max. She pities her absent, gambler father, Boris. She eventually takes revenge on her mother by seducing away her lover, even though she does not actually want him. At the time of the Russian revolution, the family flee to Finland and eventually arrive in Paris as √©migr√©s. H√©l√®ne has an admiration for France inculcated by her childhood French governess, Mademoiselle Rose. H√©l√®ne's moral integrity in the novel centres on the dawning realisation that the forces which drove her hated mother's behaviour also exist within her and she must transcend them if she is not to repeat the life of her mother.

Plot Four young friends‚Äîfashion photographers Brian and Tyson, Brian's medical student wife Noelle, and fashion model Jennifer ‚Äî who is referred to by the nickname \\"Atheria\\" ‚Äî travel deep into the desert for a photography session. They suffer a car accident that renders their car hopelessly stuck in a ravine, stranding them in the desert. Brian separates from the party to search for a way out of the desert, while Noelle notices that Atheria begins to show signs that she is suffering from both a concussion and a subdural hematoma as a result of the crash. She resolves to perform an emergency procedure to relieve life- threatening intracranial pressure inside Atheria's skull, but fails to save Atheria, who dies from her injuries. In desperation, Tyson torches the car as a signal fire. Brian returns and explains that there is no sign of civilization in any direction, and thus no one to see the signal fire. After spending roughly 24 hours camped out by the car, Brian, Noelle, and Tyson decide that there is no hope of rescue, and realize that they have to hike out of the desert. Tyson advocates walking the 80 mile road that led them to their present location, since they at least know where it leads, but Noelle argues that there might be water in the mountains, which are closer. Brian recalls reading on a map that there is a town just west of the mountains‚Äîthe only form of civilization around for many, many miles, and agrees with Noelle's plan. Heat and thirst wear away at the three friends as they trek through the desert for days on end. Initially, Tyson seems to be the most resourceful of the three; he knows enough to nourish himself by drinking blood from a rattlesnake. However, as Brian, Noelle, and Tyson grow increasingly desperate for water, Tyson foolishly tries to alleviate his thirst first by eating a cactus‚Äîwhich only makes him more thirsty‚Äîand then by drinking a pool of water that Noelle warns him is tainted with arsenic. Tyson dies in the middle of the night as a result. The next night, Brian and Noelle seek shelter in a cave, where they realize that they are dying of thirst. Motivated by Noelle's revelation that she is pregnant, Brian slits his own throat so that Noelle can save her own life by drinking his blood. Noelle at first refuses, but when it becomes clear that she cannot prevent Brian from bleeding to death, she drinks. The following day, Noelle continues to hike alone, and despairs when she happens upon the crash site, and realizes she has traveled in a big circle. In a moment of despair she remembers that Atheria mentioned breast implants. She desperately searches her friend's grave, which has been picked clean by wolves, and finds one intact. She then uses it to set up a saline I.V. Afterwards, she continues to walk until she sees a car that will presumably come to her rescue. As she collapses from exhaustion, it begins to rain.

Political career Elsa Fornero being sworn in by the President of Italy (16 November 2011) On 16 November 2011, Fornero was appointed Minister of Labour, Social Policies, and Gender Equality, replacing Maurizio Sacconi. Pension reform and the \\"exodus case\\" Elsa Fornero assumed the role of minister in the Monti government, boasting twenty years of experience in the study of public pension systems, in a moment of serious financial crisis of the state that began in the summer of 2011 with the public debt crisis and the risk of not being able to pay public wages and pensions. As part of the \\"Save Italy\\" decree presented on 4 December 2011, the ministry presented a set of reforms of the Italian public pension system, drawn up in just 20 days. The reforms contemplated a number of measures to cut public spending and increase revenue with a concomitant increase in pension contributions. The pension reform resulted in the so-called \\"exodus case\\" of 2012: this affair was at the centre of political and social disputes, as well as ideological and social clashes between workers' unions and the Monti government, with various controversies in the political arena and several debates within the Confindustria. The parliamentary clash ended on 4 July 2012 when the Chamber of Deputies rejected a no-confidence motion filed against Fornero by the Italia dei Valori party together with the Lega Nord party. Controversy Fornero was accused by many journalists, media, and politicians belonging to opposition parties of acting with a snobbish attitude towards the problems of common people during the economic crisis. Her statement that \\"nowadays, a job would not be a right anymore\\" became quite famous. In December 2011, shortly after her appointment to the government post, Fornero cried publicly while presenting new austerity measures.'Italy's Welfare Minister Elsa Fornero Cries As She Reveals Austerity Cuts' Felicity Morse Huffington Post, 5 December 2011 Personal life Elsa Fornero with her husband Mario Deaglio in Trento, 2012 Fornero is married to economist and journalist Mario Deaglio; they have two children together: Silvia Deaglio, who is an associate professor of medical genetics at the University of Turin; and Andrea Deaglio, a film director.

She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local Pakistani Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become \\"the most prominent citizen\\" of the country. The daughter of educational activist Ziauddin, Yousafzai was born to a Pashtun family in Mingora, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Her family came to run a chain of schools in the region. Considering Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was particularly inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work. In early 2009, when she was 11‚Äì12, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life during the Pakistani Taliban occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu. On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in the Swat District, after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Pakistani Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. Yousafzai was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK. The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for Yousafzai. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become \\"the most famous teenager in the world\\". Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of fifty leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwƒÅ against those who tried to kill her. The Pakistani Taliban were internationally denounced by governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups. Pakistani Taliban officials responded to condemnation by further denouncing Yousafzai, indicating plans for a possible second assassination attempt, which was justified as a religious obligation. Their statements resulted in further international condemnation. Following her recovery, Yousafzai became a prominent activist for the right to education. Based in Birmingham, she co-founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation with Shiza Shahid, and in 2013 co-authored I Am Malala, an international best seller. In 2012, she was the recipient of Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize and the 2013 Sakharov Prize. In 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi of India. Aged 17 at the time, she was the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. In 2015, Yousafzai was a subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured her as one of the most influential people globally. In 2017, she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada. Yousafzai attended Edgbaston High School in England from 2013 to 2017, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from the University of Oxford where she was an undergraduate student of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in 2020. Early life Childhood Yousafzai with her father in 2013 Yousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, into a lower-middle-class family. She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Tor Pekai Yousafzai. Her family is Sunni Muslim of Pashtun ethnicity, belonging to the Yusufzai tribe. The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and as a result, Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours. She was given her first name Malala (meaning \\"grief-stricken\\") after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan. At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chicken. Fluent in Pashto, Urdu and English, Yousafzai was educated mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, who is a poet, school owner, and an educational activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. In an interview, Yousafzai once stated that she aspired to become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed. Inspired by the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the two-time elected Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Yousafzai started speaking about education rights as early as September 2008, when her father took her to Peshawar to speak at the local press club. \\"How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?\\" Yousafzai asked her audience in a speech covered by newspapers and television channels throughout the region. In 2009, Yousafzai began as a trainee and then a peer educator in the Institute for War and Peace Reporting's Open Minds Pakistan youth programme, which worked in schools in the region to help young people engage in constructive discussion on social issues through the tools of journalism, public debate and dialogue. As a BBC blogger From left to right: Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Muhammad Ali Jinnah have influenced Yousafzai In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu website and his colleagues came up with a novel way of covering the Pakistani Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Pakistani Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed and later stated that: \\"We had been covering the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't know much about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban\\", said Mirza Waheed, the former editor of BBC Urdu. Because they were concerned about Yousafzai's safety, BBC editors insisted that she use a pseudonym. Her blog was published under the byline \\"Gul Makai\\" (\\"cornflower\\" in Urdu), a name taken from a character in a Pashtun folktale. On 3 January 2009, Yousafzai's first entry was posted to the BBC Urdu blog. She would hand-write notes and then pass them on to a reporter who would scan and e-mail them. The blog records Yousafzai's thoughts during the First Battle of Swat, as military operations take place, fewer girls show up to school, and finally, her school shuts down. That same day, on her BBC blog entry, she wrote: > I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taliban. > I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat. > My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school. I was afraid going to > school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from > attending schools. Only 11 out of 27 pupils attended the class because the > number decreased because of the Pakistani Taliban's edict. My three friends > have shifted to Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi with their families after > this edict. In Mingora, the Pakistani Taliban had set an edict that no girls could attend school after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown up more than a hundred girls' schools. The night before the ban took effect was filled with the noise of artillery fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper. =Banned from school= Following the edict, the Pakistani Taliban destroyed several more local schools. On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote: \\"Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Pakistani Taliban allow girls to go to school. We were told to prepare certain chapters for the exam but I do not feel like studying.\\" In February 2009, girls' schools were still closed. In solidarity, private schools for boys had decided not to open until 9 February, and notices appeared saying so. On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an \\"eerie silence\\". \\"We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for our mother but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late. Many other shops were also closed\\", she wrote in her blog. Their home had been robbed and their television was stolen. After boys' schools reopened, the Pakistani Taliban lifted restrictions on girls' primary education, where there was co-education. Girls-only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended, out of 700 pupils who were enrolled. On 15 February, gunshots could be heard in the streets of Mingora, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying: \\"Don't be scared ‚Äì this is firing for peace.\\" Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and the militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Pakistani Taliban announced the peace deal on their FM Radio studio, another round of stronger firing started outside. Yousafzai spoke out against the Pakistani Taliban on the national current affairs show Capital Talk on 18 February. Three days later, Pakistani Taliban leader Maulana Fazlulla announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but they had to wear burqas. =Girls' schools reopen= On 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates \\"played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before\\". Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Pakistani Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted. Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: \\"People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting.\\" On 9 March, Yousafzai wrote about a science paper that she performed well on, and added that the Taliban were no longer searching vehicles as they once did. Her blog ended on 12 March 2009. As a displaced person After the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by New York Times reporter Adam B. Ellick about filming a documentary. In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat. Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives. \\"I'm really bored because I have no books to read,\\" Yousafzai is filmed saying in the documentary. That month, after criticising militants at a press conference, Yousafzai's father received a death threat over the radio by a Pakistani Taliban commander. Yousafzai was deeply inspired in her activism by her father. That summer, for the first time, she committed to becoming a politician and not a doctor, as she had once aspired to be. By early July, refugee camps were filled to capacity. The prime minister made a long-awaited announcement saying that it was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Pakistani Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first ‚Äì to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, \\"Respected ambassador, if you can help us in our education, so please help us.\\" When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage. Early activism Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, one of Yousafzai's sources of inspiration Following the documentary, Yousafzai was interviewed on the national Pashto-language station AVT Khyber, the Urdu-language Daily Aaj, and Canada's Toronto Star. She made a second appearance on Capital Talk on 19 August 2009. Her BBC blogging identity was being revealed in articles by December 2009. She also began appearing on television to publicly advocate for female education. From 2009 to 2010 she was the chair of the District Child Assembly of the Khpal Kor Foundation through 2009 and 2010. In 2011 Yousafzai trained with local girls' empowerment organisation, Aware Girls, run by Gulalai Ismail whose training includes advice on women's rights and empowerment to peacefully oppose radicalisation through education. In October 2011, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a South African activist, nominated Yousafzai for the International Children's Peace Prize of the Dutch international children's advocacy group KidsRights Foundation. She was the first Pakistani girl to be nominated for the award. The announcement said, \\"Malala dared to stand up for herself and other girls and used national and international media to let the world know girls should also have the right to go to school.\\" The award was won by Michaela Mycroft of South Africa. Her public profile rose even further when she was awarded Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize two months later in December. On 19 December 2011, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani awarded her the National Peace Award for Youth. At the proceedings in her honour, Yousafzai stated that she was not a member of any political party, but hoped to found a national party of her own to promote education. The prime minister directed the authorities to set up an IT campus in the Swat Degree College for Women at Yousafzai's request, and a secondary school was renamed in her honour. By 2012, Yousafzai was planning to organise the Malala Education Foundation, which would help poor girls go to school. In 2012, Malala attended the International Marxist Tendency National Marxist Summer School. Education From March 2013 to July 2017, Yousafzai was a pupil at the all-girls Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. In August 2015, she received 6 A*s and 4 As at GCSE level. At A Level, she studied Geography, History, Mathematics and Religious Studies. Also applying to Durham University, the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics (LSE), Yousafzai was interviewed at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in December 2016 and received a conditional offer of three As in her A Levels; in August 2017, she was accepted to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). On 19 June 2020, it was announced that she had completed her finals exams at university. Murder attempt As Yousafzai became more recognised, the dangers facing her increased. Death threats against her were published in newspapers and slipped under her door. On Facebook, where she was an active user, she began to receive threats. Eventually, a Taliban spokesman said they were \\"forced\\" to act. In a meeting held in the summer of 2012, Taliban leaders unanimously agreed to kill her. On 9 October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Yousafzai as she rode home on a bus after taking an exam in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Yousafzai was 15 years old at the time. According to reports, a masked gunman shouted: \\"Which one of you is Malala? Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all.\\" Upon being identified, Yousafzai was shot with one bullet, which travelled from the side of her left eye, through her neck and landed in her shoulder. Two other girls were also wounded in the shooting: Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, both of whom were stable enough following the shooting, to speak to reporters and provide details of the attack. Medical treatment After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a military hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of her skull was removed to allow room for swelling. On 11 October 2012, a panel of Pakistani and British doctors decided to move Yousafzai to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. Mumtaz Khan, a doctor, said that she had a 70% chance of survival. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Yousafzai would be moved to Germany, where she could receive the best medical treatment, as soon as she was stable enough to travel. A team of doctors would travel with her, and the government would bear the cost of her treatment. Doctors reduced Yousafzai's sedation on 13 October, and she moved all four limbs. Offers to treat Yousafzai came from around the world. On 15 October, Yousafzai travelled to the United Kingdom for further treatment, approved by both her doctors and family. Her plane landed in Birmingham, England where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, one of the specialties of this hospital being the treatment of military personnel injured in conflict. According to media reports at the time, the UK Government stated that \\"[t]he Pakistani government is paying all transport, migration, medical, accommodation and subsistence costs for Malala and her party.\\" Yousafzai had come out of her coma by 17 October 2012, was responding well to treatment, and was said to have a good chance of fully recovering without any brain damage. Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, but was still battling an infection. By 8 November, she was photographed sitting up in bed. On 11 November, Yousafzai underwent surgery for eight and a half hours, in order to repair her facial nerve. On 3 January 2013, Yousafzai was discharged from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home in the West Midlands, where she had weekly physiotherapy. She underwent a five-hour long operation on 2 February to reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing with a cochlear implant, after which she was reported to be in stable condition. Yousafzai wrote in July 2014 that her facial nerve had recovered up to 96%.From the Preface to the 2014 edition of I Am Malala, page xix. . Reaction Barack Obama, Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia meet Yousafzai in the Oval Office, 11 October 2013 The murder attempt received worldwide media coverage and produced an outpouring of sympathy and anger. Protests against the shooting were held in several Pakistani cities the day after the attack, and over 2 million people signed the Right to Education campaign's petition, which led to ratification of the first Right to Education Bill in Pakistan. Pakistani officials offered a 10 million rupee (US$105,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. Responding to concerns about his safety, Yousafzai's father said: \\"We wouldn't leave our country if my daughter survives or not. We have an ideology that advocates peace. The Taliban cannot stop all independent voices through the force of bullets.\\" Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari described the shooting as an attack on \\"civilized people\\". UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon called it a \\"heinous and cowardly act\\". United States President Barack Obama found the attack \\"reprehensible, disgusting and tragic\\", while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Yousafzai had been \\"very brave in standing up for the rights of girls\\" and that the attackers had been \\"threatened by that kind of empowerment\\". British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the shooting \\"barbaric\\" and that it had \\"shocked Pakistan and the world\\". American singer Madonna dedicated her song \\"Human Nature\\" to Yousafzai at a concert in Los Angeles the day of the attack, as well had a temporary Malala tattoo on her back. American actress Angelina Jolie wrote an article about explaining the event to her children and answering questions like \\"Why did those men think they needed to kill Malala?\\" Jolie later donated $200,000 to the Malala Fund for girls' education. Former First Lady of the United States Laura Bush wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post in which she compared Yousafzai to Holocaust diarist Anne Frank. Indian director Amjad Khan announced that he would be making a biographical film based on Yousafzai. Ehsanullah Ehsan, chief spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that Yousafzai \\"is the symbol of the infidels and obscenity\\", adding that if she survived, the group would target her again. In the days following the attack, the Pakistani Taliban reiterated its justification, saying Yousafzai had been brainwashed by her father: \\"We warned him several times to stop his daughter from using dirty language against us, but he didn't listen and forced us to take this extreme step.\\" The Pakistani Taliban also justified its attack as part of religious scripture, stating that the Quran says that \\"people propagating against Islam and Islamic forces would be killed\\", going on to say that \\"Sharia says that even a child can be killed if he is propagating against Islam\\". On 12 October 2012, a group of 50 Islamic clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwƒÅ ‚Äì a ruling of Islamic law ‚Äì against the Taliban gunmen who tried to kill Yousafzai. Islamic scholars from the Sunni Ittehad Council publicly denounced attempts by the Pakistani Taliban to mount religious justifications for the shooting of Yousafzai and two of her classmates. Although the attack was roundly condemned in Pakistan, \\"some fringe Pakistani political parties and extremist outfits\\" have aired conspiracy theories, such as the shooting being staged by the American Central Intelligence Agency to provide an excuse for continuing drone attacks. The Pakistani Taliban and some other pro-Pakistani Taliban elements branded Yousafzai an \\"American spy\\". United Nations petition On 15 October 2012, UN Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister, visited Yousafzai while she was in the hospital, and launched a petition in her name and \\"in support of what Malala fought for\\". Using the slogan \\"I am Malala\\", the petition's main demand was that there be no child left out of school by 2015, with the hope that \\"girls like Malala everywhere will soon be going to school\\". Brown said he would hand the petition to President Zardari in Islamabad in November. The petition contains three demands: * We call on Pakistan to agree to a plan to deliver education for every child. * We call on all countries to outlaw discrimination against girls. * We call on international organisations to ensure the world's 61 million out-of-school children are in education by the end of 2015. Criminal investigation, arrests, and acquittals The day after the shooting, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik stated that the Taliban gunman who shot Yousafzai had been identified. Police named 23-year-old Atta Ullah Khan, a graduate student in chemistry, as the gunman in the attack. he remained at large, possibly in Afghanistan. The police also arrested six men for involvement in the attack, but they were later released due to lack of evidence. In November 2012, US sources confirmed that Mullah Fazlullah, the cleric who ordered the attack on Yousafzai, was hiding in Eastern Afghanistan. He was killed by a U.S.-Afghan air strike in June 2018. On 12 September 2014, ISPR Director, Major General Asim Bajwa, told a media briefing in Islamabad that the 10 attackers belong to a militant group called \\"Shura\\". General Bajwa said that Israrur Rehman was the first militant group member who was identified and apprehended by the troops. Acting upon the information received during his interrogation, all other members of the militant group were arrested. It was an intelligence-based joint operation conducted by ISI, police, and military. In April 2015, the ten who were arrested were sentenced to life in prison by Judge Mohammad Amin Kundi, a counterterrorism judge, with the chance of eligibility for parole, and possible release, after 25 years. It is not known if the actual would-be murderers were among the ten sentenced. In June 2015, it was revealed that eight of the ten men tried in-camera for the attack had in fact been secretly acquitted, insiders revealed one of the men acquitted and freed was the murder bid's mastermind. It is believed that all other men who shot Yousafzai fled to Afghanistan afterwards and were never even captured. The information about the release of suspects came to light after the London Daily Mirror attempted to locate the men in prison. Senior police official Salim Khan stated that the eight men were released because there was not enough evidence to connect them to the attack. Continuing activism Yousafzai spoke before the United Nations in July 2013, and had an audience with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. In September, she spoke at Harvard University, and in October, she met with US President Barack Obama and his family; during that meeting, she confronted him on his use of drone strikes in Pakistan. In December, she addressed the Oxford Union. In July 2014, Yousafzai spoke at the Girl Summit in London. In October 2014, she donated $50,000 to the UNRWA for reconstruction of schools on the Gaza Strip. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, Yousafzai did not describe herself as a feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. On 12 July 2015, her 18th birthday, Yousafzai opened a school in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, near the Syrian border, for Syrian refugees. The school, funded by the not-for-profit Malala Fund, offers education and training to girls aged 14 to 18 years. Yousafzai called on world leaders to invest in \\"books, not bullets\\". Yousafzai has repeatedly condemned the Rohingya persecution in Myanmar. In June 2015, the Malala Fund released a statement in which Yousafzai argues that the Rohingya people deserve \\"citizenship in the country where they were born and have lived for generations\\" along with \\"equal rights and opportunities.\\" She urges world leaders, particularly in Myanmar, to \\"halt the inhuman persecution of Burma's Muslim minority Rohingya people.\\" In September 2017, speaking in Oxford, Yousafzai said: \\"This should be a human rights issue. Governments should react to it. People are being displaced, they're facing violence.\\" Yousafzai also posted a statement on Twitter calling for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to condemn the treatment of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. Suu Kyi has avoided taking sides in the conflict, or condemning violence against the Rohingya people, leading to widespread criticism. In 2014, Yousafzai stated that she wished to return to Pakistan following her education in the U.K., and inspired by Benazir Bhutto, she would consider running for prime minister: \\"If I can help my country by joining the government or becoming the prime minister, I would definitely be up for this task.\\" She repeated this aim in 2015 and 2016. However, Yousafzai noted in 2018 that her goal had changed, stating that \\"now that I have met so many presidents and prime ministers around the world, it just seems that things are not simple and there are other ways that I can bring the change that I want to see\\". In an interview with David Letterman, for Netflix's show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, Yousafzai was asked: \\"Would you ever want to hold a political position?\\" and replied \\"Me? No.\\" Representation Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown arranged for Yousafzai's appearance before the United Nations in July 2013. Brown also requested that McKinsey consultant Shiza Shahid, a friend of the Yousafzai family, chair Yousafzai's charity fund, which had gained the support of Angelina Jolie. Google's vice-president Megan Smith also sits on the fund's board. In November 2012, the consulting firm Edelman began work for Yousafzai on a pro bono basis, which according to the firm \\"involves providing a press office function for Malala\\". The office employs five people, and is headed by speechwriter Jamie Lundie. McKinsey also continues to provide assistance to Yousafzai. Malala Day Yousafzai on a special visit to Strasbourg in November 2013 Malala with Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis in 2015 On 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event \\"Malala Day\\". Yousafzai wore one of Benazir Bhutto's shawls to the UN. It was her first public speech since the attack, leading the first ever Youth Takeover of the UN, with an audience of over 500 young education advocates from around the world. Yousafzai received several standing ovations. Ban Ki- moon, who also spoke at the session, described her as \\"our hero\\". Yousafzai also presented the chamber with \\"The Education We Want\\", a Youth Resolution of education demands written by Youth for Youth, in a process co-ordinated by the UN Global Education First Youth Advocacy Group, telling her audience: The Pakistani government did not comment on Yousafzai's UN appearance, amid a backlash against her in Pakistan's press and social media. Words from the speech were used as lyrics for \\"Speak Out\\", a song by Kate Whitley commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and broadcast on International Women's Day 2017.  Jon Stewart interview  On 8 October 2013 Malala, at the age of 16, visited The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, her first major late night appearance. She was there as a guest to promote her book, \\"I am Malala\\". On the program they discussed her assassination attempt, human rights, and women's education. She left Jon Stewart speechless when she described her thoughts after learning the Pakistani Taliban wanted her dead, saying: Stewart visibly moved by her words ended the conversation saying, \\"I am humbled to speak with you\\". Stewart would again have her as a guest on the show after the 2015 Charleston Church Shooting, in which he started the show citing no jokes saying, \\"our guest is a incredible person who suffered unspeakable violence by extremists and her perseverance and determination through that to continue on is an incredibly inspiration and to be quite honestly with you, I don't think there's anyone else in the world I would rather talk to tonight than Malala so that's what we'll do and sorry about no jokes. Nobel Peace Prize Yousafzai's shawl on display at the Nobel Prize Museum On 10 October 2014, Yousafzai was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Having received the prize at the age of 17, Yousafzai is the youngest Nobel laureate. Yousafzai shared the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. She is the second Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize after 1979 Physics laureate Abdus Salam. After she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the decision. A Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl, commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize: \\"This is not for fine people who have done nice things and are glad to receive it. All of that is irrelevant. What Nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global disarmament.\\" Ad√°n Cort√©s, a college student from Mexico City and asylum seeker, interrupted Yousafzai's Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in protest for the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping in Mexico, but was quickly taken away by security personnel. Yousafzai later sympathised, and acknowledged that problems are faced by young people all over the world, saying \\"there are problems in Mexico, there are problems even in America, even here in Norway, and it is really important that children raise their voices\\". David Letterman interview In March 2018, Yousafzai was the subject of an interview with David Letterman for his Netflix show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. Speaking about the Taliban, she opined that their misogyny comes from a superiority complex, and is reinforced by finding \\"excuses\\" in culture or literature, such as by misinterpreting teachings of Islam. On the topic of her attackers, Yousafzai comments that \\"I forgive them because that's the best revenge I can have\\". Pointing out that the person who attacked her was a young boy, she says that \\"He thought he was doing the right thing\\". Asked about the presidency of Donald Trump, Yousafzai said: \\"Some of the things have really disappointed me, like sexual harassment and the ban on Muslims and racism.\\" She also criticised the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to education, saying that education is the first step to \\"eradicating extremism and ending poverty\\". Throughout the episode, clips are shown of Yousafzai acting as a tour guide for prospective students to her college Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Reception Reception in Pakistan Reception of Yousafzai in Pakistan is mostly negative. Yousafzai's opposition to Taliban policy makes her unpopular among Taliban sympathisers. A Dawn columnist alleges that she is scapegoated by the failing state government, and a journalist in The Nation wrote that Yousafzai is hated by \\"overzealous patriots\\" who are keen to deny oppression of women in the country. Yousafzai's statements conflict with the view that militancy in Pakistan is a result of Western interference, and conservatives and Islamic fundamentalists describe her ideology as \\"anti-Pakistan\\" and \\"anti-Islam\\". In 2015, the All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) banned I Am Malala in all Pakistani private schools, and the president Mirza Kashif Ali released a book I Am Not Malala. The book accuses Yousafzai of attacking Pakistan's army under the pretence of female education, describes her father as a \\"double agent\\" and a \\"traitor\\" and denounces the Malala Fund's promotion of secular education. However, Ali claimed that \\"we are not against her but the ideology being imposed on us\\" and pointed out that the APPSF went on a national strike when Yousafzai was attacked. Conspiracy theorists in newspapers and on social media have alleged that Yousafzai staged her assassination attempt, or that she is an agent of the American Central Intelligence Agency. Many Pakistanis view her as an \\"agent of the West\\", due to her Nobel prize, Oxford education and residence in England. Another conspiracy theory alleges that Yousafzai is a Jewish agent. However, Yousafzai does have some support in Pakistani media; Farman Nawaz argues that Yousafzai would have gained more fame in Pakistan if she belonged to the province of Punjab. His opinion was not given importance by the mainstream media of Pakistan but his views in this regard were published by Daily Outlook Afghanistan. Yousafzai is seen as courageous by some Pakistanis. On 29 March 2018, Yousafzai returned to Pakistan for the first time since the shooting. Meeting Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she gave a speech in which she said it had been her dream to return \\"without any fear\\". Yousafzai then visited her hometown Mingora in Swat Valley. The APPSF, a group representing the 173,000 private schools in Pakistan, organised \\"I am not Malala Day\\" on 30 March. Yousafzai responded by saying \\"I am proud of my religion, and I am proud of my country.\\" Stand on Kashmir On 7 August 2019, following the Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Yousafzai expressed her worry about the situation and appealed to the international community to ensure peace in Kashmir. On 14 September 2019, Malala posted a tweet, in which she said that a Kashmiri girl told her: \\"I feel purposeless and depressed because I can't go to school. I missed my exams on August 12 and I feel my future is insecure now.\\" However, many Twitter users pointed out that on 12 August 2019, it was Eid al-Adha in India, a public holiday when schools were closed across the country, so an exam would not be possible on that day. After her tweet, Yousafzai was harassed widely on Twitter, and accused of spreading the \\"Pakistani agenda\\" over Kashmir and being selective in the protest by the Indians. Works alt=International Poetry Festival 2013 in Argentina Yousafzai's memoir I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, co-written with British journalist Christina Lamb, was published in October 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the US and by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK.\\"Formats and Editions of I Am Malala WorldCat. Retrieved 11 April 2014. Fatima Bhutto, reviewing the book for The Guardian called the book \\"fearless\\" and stated that \\"the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book\\", though she criticised \\"the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent\\" that is interwoven with Yousafzai's. Marie Arana for The Washington Post called the book \\"riveting\\" and wrote \\"It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank.\\" Tina Jordan in Entertainment Weekly gave the book a \\"B+\\", writing \\"Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted.\\" Yousafzai at Women of the World Festival, 2014 A children's edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. According to Publishers Weekly, in 2017 the book had sold almost 2 million copies, and there were 750,000 copies of the children's edition in print. Yousafzai was the subject of the 2015 documentary He Named Me Malala, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. In 2017, a Hindi biopic film Gul Makai was announced, with Reem Sameer Shaikh portraying her. Yousafzai authored a picture book, Malala's Magic Pencil, which was illustrated by Kerasco√´t and published on 17 October 2017. By March 2018, The Bookseller reported that the book had over 5,000 sales in the UK. In a review for The Guardian, Imogen Carter describes the book as \\"enchanting\\", opining that it \\"strikes just the right balance\\" between \\"heavy-handed\\" and \\"heartfelt\\", and is a \\"welcome addition to the frustratingly small range of children's books that feature BAME central characters\\". Rebecca Gurney of The Daily Californian gives the book a grade of 4.5 out of 5, calling it a \\"beautiful account of a terrifying but inspiring tale\\" and commenting \\"Though the story begins with fantasy, it ends starkly grounded in reality.\\" In March 2018, it was announced that Yousafzai's next book We Are Displaced: True Stories of Refugee Lives would be published on 4 September 2018 by Little, Brown and Company's Young Readers division. The book is about refugees, and includes stories from Yousafzai's own life along with those of people she has met. Speaking about the book, Yousafzai said that \\"What tends to get lost in the current refugee crisis is the humanity behind the statistics\\" and \\"people become refugees when they have no other option. This is never your first choice.\\" Profits from the book will go to Yousafzai's charity Malala Fund. She visited Australia and criticized its asylum policies and compared immigration policies of the U.S. and Europe unfavourably to those of poor countries and Pakistan. The book was published on 8 January 2019.

After the success of the Portuguese military in the Eastern front by 1973, it started to be known as the Eastern Zone, since guerrilla warfare episodes were nonexistent. Through economic and social promotion campaigns, including the construction of healthcare, education, sanitation, transport and security infrastructure, the construction of new villages, the training of new black military units like the Flechas, and the foreign units known as the Fi√©is (former gendarmes from Zaire) and the Leais (refugees from Zambia), the Portuguese operations in the late stage of the anti-guerrilla war in Portuguese Angola, eradicated all the main sources of conflict in the territory.Ant√≥nio Pires Nunes, Angola, 1966-74: vit√≥ria militar no leste, , 9789728563783, Publisher: Pref√°cio, 2002 History Campaign in the Eastern Front From 1966 to 1970, the pro-independence guerrilla movement People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), expanded their limited insurgency operations to the East of Angola. This vast countryside area was far way from the main urban centers and close to foreign countries were the guerrillas were able to take shelter. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), a smaller pro-independence guerrilla organization established in the East, supported the MPLA. Until 1970, the combined guerrilla forces of MPLA and UNITA in the East Front were successful in pressuring Portuguese Armed Forces (FAP) in the area to the point that the guerrillas were able to cross the Cuanza River and could threat the territory of Bi√© which had an important urban center in the agricultural, commercial and industrial town of Silva Porto. In 1970, Francisco da Costa Gomes, the Chief- Commander of the Armed Forces of Angola, decided to reinforce the Eastern Front by relocating troops and armament from the North to the East. In 1971, the FAP started a counter-insurgency military campaign, that although provoking a number of civilian collateral damages in its first stage, effectively expelled the three guerrilla movements operating in the East of Angola to beyond the frontiers of the territory. The last guerrillas lost hundreds of soldiers and left tons of equipment behind, disbanding chaotically to the neighboring foreign countries in the region or in some cases, joining or surrendering to the Portuguese authorities. In order to gain the confidence of the local rural populations, and create conditions for their permanent and productive settlement in the region, the FAP organized massive vaccination campaigns, medical check-ups, water, sanitation and alimentary infrastructure. 45% of Eastern Angola population were under 15 years old and less than 10% of those children had gone to school. The FAP built schools and enforced policies to stimulating the admittance of the local child in those schools. On 31 December 1972, the Development Plan of the East (Plano de Desenvolvimento do Leste) included in its first stage, 466 development enterprises (150 were completed and 316 were being built). 19 health centers had been built and 26 were being constructed. 51 new schools were operating and 82 were being constructed. Ant√≥nio Pires Nunes, Angola Vit√≥ria Militar no Leste Life in the Eastern Zone The move also included the grouping of the population in purpose-built villages as a way to better accomplish the imperatives of the two assigned missions: to contribute to the economic and social development of people and dissociate the population of the guerrillas and their influence, avoiding scattered rural villagers of being an easy source of coercive recruitment or logistics by the guerrillas. The reorganization of populations in Angola took several forms that deserved the attention of journalists and writers, both foreign and national, that compared the development plans of the Portuguese authorities to what they knew what they did in the wars in Algeria and Vietnam. They were amazed how, without great resources in Eastern Angola, it was possible to put together the concept of strategic village to the concept of socioeconomic village to build a mixed settlement for the local populations. This was the typical village of East Zone in Phase 1, built from scratch for military reasons but where was exerted an intense economic and social promotion campaign. In 1973, in the East were working five contracting firms with annual capacity to build 700 km of paved road and at the same time, the military engineering company proceeded to the opening and repair of trails with tactical operational interest. Special military units New all-black military units like the Flechas, the foreign units known as the Fi√©is (former gendarmes from Zaire) and the Leais (refugees from Zambia), were armed, equipped and trained in order to combat the guerrillas and later were used to patrol the borders and perform routine security missions. Aftermath After the Portuguese withdrawal from Angola in 1974-75 due to the events of the Carnation Revolution military coup in Lisbon, the MPLA and UNITA splintered, and the Angolan Civil War began as the movements clashed militarily and ideologically. MPLA leader Agostinho Neto became the first president of newly independent Angola, officially the People's Republic of Angola. Backed by Soviet and Cuban money, weapons and troops, the MPLA defeated the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) militarily and forced them largely into exile. UNITA also was nearly destroyed in November 1975, but it managed to survive and set up a second government in the provincial capital of Huambo. UNITA was hard-pressed but recovered with South African aid and then was strengthened considerably by U.S. support during the 1980s. The MPLA's military presence was strongest in Angolan cities, the coastal region and the strategic oil fields. But UNITA controlled much of the highlands interior, notably the Bi√© Plateau, and other strategic regions of the country. Over 500,000 Angolans died in the civil war. Millions of refugees were displaced from their lands.

He achieved lasting success with Las corsarias (1919)... Las bravias continued along the same line, but Alonso later went back to a more traditional zarzuela format with La linda tapada (1924), a work of undoubted quality. The regional zarzuela ‚Äî Castilian peasants this time ‚Äî appeared in La Bejarana (1924), from which a number of songs still survive; and in the Murcian zarzuela La Parranda (1928), which has also endured. Still, Alonso's masterwork is La Calesera (1925), which evokes the city of Madrid and popular culture, as well as a wider Spanish feeling, recalling the political battles of the nineteenth century...\\"Vincent J. Cincotta - Zarzuela, the Spanish lyric theatre: a complete reference 2003 \\"During his 48-year career, Alonso composed the music for 74 zarzuelas and sainetes liricos, 72 operettas and musical revues, 32 lyrical entremeses and other short musical pieces for the theatre, ...\\" Alonso's music is funny, cheerful, easy melody and with a popular accent. He excelled in pasodobles and chotis, which he impressed with grace and ease. Many of his works are still highly valued, as the pasacalle Los Nardos, the chotis El Pichi, both from Las Leandras, the chotis Tabaco and cerillas from the revue Las de Villadiego or the song Maitechu m√≠a (both with lyrics by Emilio Gonz√°lez del Castillo). He wrote also two pasodobles for fiestas in the city of Alicante, Les Fogueres de Sant Joan, titled La festa del poble, premiered in 1934, and La Nit de San Joan 1934, a pasodoble foguerer for band, chorus and bass soloist. He also was elected president of the General Society of Authors of Spain. Childhood and early youth Francisco Alonso was born in Granada, where he received his early education from the Piarists. As the son of a pianist, Alonso was interested in music from early childhood. His mother supported him when, unable to overcome the dissection classes , he abandoned a career in medicine for musical studies. He studied music initially with Antonio Segura, and later with Celestino Villa, choirmaster of the Cathedral of Granada. Alonso's first compositions were created for the Escuelas del Ave Mar√≠a (founder Andr√©s Manj√≥n). Later, he wrote music for ballroom dances such as polkas, mazurkas, and waltzes. When he was 16 years old, he led the band of the powder workers of the El Fargue district of Granada, and later created a choir at the Philharmonic Society of Granada that performed several concerts in Granada. At age 18 he premiered his first opera with La Ni√±a de los Cantares, performed at the Teatro Cervantes in 1905. At that time he also became the director of the regimental band of C√≥rdoba, for whom he composed his well-known pasodoble P√≥lvora sin Humo. In Madrid His mother and father died in 1905 and 1908 respectively and Alonso decided to move to Madrid to focus on making the most of the better musical opportunities offered by the capital. After a banquet and tribute offered by his colleagues on March 12, he bid farewell to Granada in 1911. He arrived in Madrid with 600 pesetas in his pocket and initially devoted himself to writing cupl√©s, then very fashionable, for stars of the time as La Fornarina, Resurrecci√≥n Quijano, :es:Pastora Imperio, La Bella Chelito and La Goya. But he met only modest success for his stage works as the one act sainete ¬°Armas al Hombro! with the composer :es:Tom√°s L√≥pez Torregrosa, which premiered at the :es:Teatro Mart√≠n on 13 November 1911. In 1913 El Bueno de Guzm√°n premiered with the librettist and composer :es:Enrique Garc√≠a √Ålvarez. Alonso had to wait until 1916 for his first real success with the revueM√∫sica, Luz y Alegr√≠a, which premiered at the :es:Teatro Novedades de Madrid. In 1918 he premiered a lyrical fantasy De Madrid al Infierno, with the chotis Oye Nicanora which was repeatedly encored by the audience. He showed more maturity in his orchestration in Las Corsarias, premiered at the Teatro Mart√≠n in 1919, that included the pasodoble La Banderita which became extremely popular in Spain, was sung by soldiers who were off to the Rif War of Africa, so that even the king Alfonso XIII was heard singing it while shaving, the more than twenty thousand performances of the work since its premiere by the company of Salvador Videgain made the maestro one of the great composers of the time, achieving even a decoration for the flag. From this time the Master is free to compose at will. His works met the same success in many countries of Latin America and Alonso was able to stage some of his works in Paris. In 1924, came a consecutive series of successes starting with La Linda Tapada, premiered at the Teatro C√≥mico and included the popular Canci√≥n del Gitano, followed by La Bejarana premiered the same year at the Teatro Apolo and that was equally popular for its Pasodoble de los Quintos. At this time Alonso took inspiration from folk music of the various regions of Spain as in Curro el de Lora with its Andalusian atmosphere to a libretto by :es:Luis Fernandez Ardav√≠n, released in 1925, but which met with little success despite its excellent score. At the Teatro de la Zarzuela in the same year he premiered La Calesera, with a Madrid ambience, and featuring Pasodoble de los Chisperos and Himno a la Libertad. La Parranda set in Murcia opened in 1937. This included the Canci√≥n del Platero and the Canto a Murcia which became a popular anthem of the region. In La Picarona (1931), set in Segovia, its Canto a Segovia stood out. Paco Alonso not only composed operettas, but was a versatile author who created many sketches and revues. Of those released in 1927 in :es:Teatro Eslava Las Castigadoras, featuring the Chotis de las Taquimecas and Las Cari√±osas. The next year followed Chotis de la Lola. But his greatest success in the field of the revue came in 1931 with Las Leandras premiered at the Teatro Pav√≥n and written especially for the star :es:Celia G√°mez who scored an enormous hit with Pasodoble de los Nardos and the chotis El Pichi. Until the Spanish Civil War he premiered mainly revues like Las de Villadiego, Las de los Ojos en Blanco which include the pasodoble Horchatera Valenciana, Mujeres de Fuego and some zarzuelas like Me Llaman la Presumida (1935). After the war the love of zarzuela fell into a deep decline and although Alonso premiered Manuelita Rosas, and La Zapaterita focussing on operetta and musical comedy with which he had some success as Do√±a Mariquita de mi Coraz√≥n (1942), Luna de Miel en El Cairo (1943), Aquella Noche Azul and Tres D√≠as Para Quererte, (both 1945). In 1947 he was elected as director of the Society of Authors and Publishers. While convalescing from an operation for retinal detachment he premiered 24 Horas Mintiendo a comedy written by :es:Francisco Ramos de Castro. After his death at his home on Calle Sagasta, Madrid, in 1948, he was buried in a massive funeral. His posthumous La Rumbosa, a lyrical sainete opened in 1951.

Due to the mutated nature of the virus, its incubation period has been reduced to hours instead of weeks or months, and its method of transmission now follows more closely that of the flu. Through multiple plot-lines, the story follows subjects as diverse as d√©tente, espionage, the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, and many others. Plot summary Set in the early 1980s, during the height of Cold War, the novel follows a series of parallel storylines. The situation at Heathrow Airport is tense, due to the arrival of the Soviet delegation, led by the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Artamonov. Heathrow VIP lounge is where they and British Foreign Minister Sir Geoffrey Drummond, are to conclude the signing of a new Anglo-Soviet treaty. Whilst tight security is being deployed by the head of the Aviation Security, Major Lawford, along with his colleagues: Colonels Donovan of the MI6 and Rasimov of the KGB, the Heathrow Medical Centre, headed by Dr. Luke Komarovsky, becomes informed that a nun from a convent near Lagos Nigeria, who was travelling on the Alitalia Boeing 747 en route to New York City via Heathrow, has become ill. Her symptoms are first diagnosed as those of hysteria caused by fear of flying, then to an epileptic seizure. The plane is given a priority landing. Dr. Komarowsky, who in the past has been a scientist, was working, along with three other doctors, each of whom will make an appearance later in the book: Dr. John Hamilton, Dr. Matthew Laverick, and Dr. Coro Deveroux, in a team headed by the world-renowned microbiologist, Dr. Frederick Lieberman. Their work, in a laboratory at Wolfenden House is veiled in mystery, but their goal (four of them were called either the nucleus or evangelists of Messiah Lieberman) was the 'holy grail' of microbiology - creation, through genetic reorganisation, of general immunity to bacterial, viral and oncological diseases. Based on genetic modification of human DNA this is intended to become hereditary. However, the most recent batch of experiments with a vaccine based on recombined Rabies virus, were performed on humans who were exposed to the rabies virus during quarantine in Britain. The human trial ended horribly, accelerating, instead of providing post exposure immunity of the vaccination, and even though the patients were well outside of the window when any rabies vaccine available on the market would be able to save them from developing symptoms. This event leads to Luke Komarowsky abandoning the field of virology and science altogether, and puts him in his present position of the head of the Heathrow Airport medical unit. The nun, after landing and quick examination, does not show the symptoms of a Generalised tonic-clonic seizure. The baffled Dr. Komarowsky decides on the diagnosis of a malaria with cerebral complications. As a precaution, he isolates the nun in the medical center, and the airplane passengers in the transit lounge of the Terminal 2. The measure fails. Airport Security, not being informed of the reason for the presence, and focusing on the arrival of the Soviet diplomatic contingent, clears out the lounge and moves the passengers into the general transit. The sole passenger whose destination was London, a Cologne bank director, is murdered by one of the bank's disgruntled employees in the Heathrow terminal 2 parking area. Soon, the nun who was escorting Mother Theresa, now isolated in the intensive care unit, begins showing symptoms, followed by the Alitalia Stewardess who was administering aid to the nun on the plane, and a nurse who got bitten by nun Theresa when she tried to give her warm water for rehydration. The developing medical crisis leads Dr. Komarowsky to contacts his former Wolfenden House colleague, Dr. Hamilton, from the Institute for the Infectious Diseases. Hamilton diagnoses the patients as suffering from an extremely virulent strain of rabies. The incubation period of less than two hours is something never seen before. The mode of transmission is also unclear. The four patients have either scrapes or bites, which is to be expected. Then the doctors of the medical service, dispatched to the Transit of the Terminal 2 after a brawl has erupted there, reports that he found some of the brawlers showing signs of epileptiform seizures. Realization that the isolation measure of Dr. Komarowsky has been breached, opens up the possibility of an epidemiological disaster at the Heathrow Airport. The committee of people responsible for running all the aspects of the airport quickly gathers as the 'Anti-Rabies committee'. They impose a strict quarantine on the medical center and the transit of Terminal 2, and general quarantine of the entire Terminal 2. Cases begin appearing rapidly, whilst Dr. Hamilton, who has received all the necessary supplies from London, to create a world class microbiology laboratory in the Control Tower of the airport, and epidemiological teams from all over the world start arriving. One of them consists of Dr. Coro Deveroux, and Dr. Lieberman (now using the surname Lohman, and who has disappeared following the incident at his Wolfenden House laboratory). Soon Dr. Hamilton comes to a further realization: the virus is nothing like any other rabies virus seen till now, for not only is it extremely virulent and replicates at an alarming rate, it is a mutant strain that has an additional layer covering its viral envelope - something against which no existing rabies vaccination produced antibodies will have any effect on. As the outbreak spirals out of control, the remaining doctors - Komarowsky, Deveroux, Hamilton and Lieberman, and a select list of other people, including the writer on whose notes the novel is supposedly based are locked in the tower which has been turned into a fortress. The people trying to escape realize that the whole of the airport has been blocked by the units of the British Army, who have orders shoot to kill anyone approaching the perimeter. Dr. Lieberman, who, hiding behind a supposed Jewish background, is in reality a former SS doctor Siegfried Stadler, who headed the plan of improving the mankind on genetic level, and has worked directly for Himmler in Auschwitz. He is, except for a small group of Jewish survivors or rather their offspring, for no one survived his experiments, completely unknown to history (he was never photographed, the couple hundred deaths his experiments led to are attributed to Mengele and other medical personnel in the camp). Also, he is not antisemitic, for he considers the entirety of humanity as being beneath what they could truly accomplish once they set their genes in order, and has worked with Jews because they were the only material available to him. He quickly discovers that the virus is one of his recombinates of the rabies virus, which he has selected to be the mechanism of the delivery of his 'serum', that will recombinate human into a 'titan', the √ºbermensch of Nietzsche. His disappearance was due to the Jewish survivors catching his trail following Wolfenden incident, and who has now been working in Syria, in theory helping them to develop a bioweapons program, in reality, continuing his work started in Auschwitz, and continued at Wolfendenn (he again states that, had Israel shown interest, he would have worked for them). Thus his development of the vaccine/serum is rapid. He does produce two doses of it, but the team locked and fortified in the control tower, realize that they do not have a patient to try it on. Luke volunteers to go and find one, not knowing that the rabies is already in the tower, since one of the members of the Aviation Security personnel has smuggled into the building a stewardess of the KLM airline with the idea to charge her safety for sexual favors, not knowing she was already infected, and thus infected him as well. As the rabies spreads rapidly amongst the remaining AS officers, Luke, who has decided the best way to certainly bring back a sample is to infect himself, runs into Dr. Matthew Lawerick (the fourth of Lieberman's 'evangelists' from Wolfenden) who has been brought to insanity following his desperate attempts to save his wife from the disease. Just as Lawerick grieves to him, Luke enters into the furious state, and, believing he's in an operating room, and operating on a patient with a tumor causing delusions, beheads him. Just as he recovers somewhat and returns to the tower, he is picked up by the remaining commander of Aviation Security, and proceeds to infect him - now there being two patients. But the situation is already too late for both, since the tower has been almost completely overrun by rabies. The sole two survivors, now also infected are Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Deveroux, locked and isolated. Both have taken Lieberman's vaccine (Lieberman himself has been killed by the writer/chronicler, whose girlfriend was really one of the Jews hunting for Stadler, and who, before he gets locked in the tower, passes him an envelope showing the results of Stadler's work on a person who is obviously the girlfriend's mother or some other close relative) and are each sitting facing each other, each in his own corner of the room they're in. Hamilton has notified the commander of the blockade that he will be in regular telephone contact, and if he doesn't call, that means the vaccine/serum fails, and Heathrow is to be 'sanitized' - completely cremated by the army. Soon though, they notice that the early signs of rabies infection begin to disappear - Liebermans serum appears to work. In the meantime, airplane carrying Soviet delegation, which left the airport in a hurry is shot down by Soviet Anti Aircraft batteries over Poland, and in Soviet Union itself, a coup takes place, when Marshal of the Soviet Union, Shurov, ousts the soft line Premier, and sets up contact with the president of the United States - he states that Soviet scientist have conclusively discovered that the virus is a laboratory mutant, that he doubts in the efficiency of Liebermans vaccine, and in the British ability to deal with the situation in general. He proposes to US to conduct a nuclear cremation of Heathrow (and maybe entire London, since there has been, later shown, mistaken, alarm that a case appeared in the city), and apparently threatens that if US refuses to cooperate, Soviet Union will proceed with the operation on its own. After some haggling about possible nuclear war resulting from it, pressure put on the British Prime Minister by US President, and Shurov's sudden backing down, an agreement is reached that suits all three of them - if the serum fails British will conduct the sanitation, but the force doing it will have a UN mandate (thus relieving British PM from the eventuality he'd have to make and carry the costs of the decision alone). Hamilton and Deveroux, who have admitted to feelings they shared for each other for years have sex on the roof of the tower. All of a sudden, the first shocking discovery is made - Hamiltons clock has stopped, he failed to make the final call that would announce, without a doubt, the success of the serum, and save Heathrow, because of it. He sees the helicopter of the newly formed UN Heathrow Rabies eradication force approaching the tower. His frantic attempts to signal the helicopter with his flashlight are cut short by completely naked Deveroux swinging a steel bar at him. His observations though do not show any outward signs of rabies, her face is calm and haughty instead, and her moves contain smooth elegance uncharacteristic to spasmodic movements of a rabies patient. All of a sudden, he, in himself begins to feel a sudden change - he begins to feel as if the whole of humanity is merely there to exist on his mercy, mercy no one has yet deserved, including this creature in front of him that tries to mimic his sudden, smooth and elegant moves. The serum was the final recombination of Stadler/Lieberman/Lohman virus. The crew of the helicopter sees only two titans, two √ºbermensch, engaged in a ferocious fight on the roof, and conclude that Heathrow is dead. Behind them, the sound of jets is heard, the first wave of the eradication of Heathrow Rabies has been launched. Since the beginning of the infection an unknown man, Gabriel, is looking out for something. Shadow that he saw in his dreams. Something is a dog from Middle-East, pioneer of the disease. He found out that dog exists from Sue Jenkins, girl that he met at the Terminal, and suddenly release that his faith is not be infected. His destiny is to save humanity. Sue's friend, along his grandfather, came to Heathrow via Alitalia airplane from Palestine-Israelian border. He brought Sharon, small black dog. Sharon's home was attacked by some other dog, dog that dr. Lieberman has infected. In all-time fight - Good against Evil, deep into sewerage system below Heathrow, both of them will be satisfied: Sharon will escape and Gabriel will survive. The book ends with the epilogue written by the supposed author, who while visiting Gabriel at the mental hospital found out about destiny of Heathrow prisoners and his friend, Daniel Leverquin, who was at the airport and chronicled the epidemic. At the last meeting with Gabriel, considering him a Heathrow Angel, Leverquin gave him his notes. He describes the Heathrow outbreak as contained, and documents that debate is being held as to what to do with the ruins of the once great airplane hub and Gabriel latest escape from mental hospital. Writer thinks that Gabriel is needed somewhere. He concludes, though, on a bleak note, quoting the last paragraph of Camus' The Plague (197=47): \\"but he alone knows what the crowd does not, that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears, that it can remain dormant for decades in furniture and bedding, can wait patiently in rooms, in cellars, in trunks, in handkerchiefs and paper, and that perhaps the day would come when, just to teach men a lesson and make them unhappy, the plague would awaken its rats and send them off to die in some happy city.

Representing a disciplinary link between economy, visual perception laws and cognitive psychology,David E. Meyer, University of Michigan, review to volume Visual marketing the subject mainly applies to businesses such as fashion and design. As a key component of modern marketing, visual marketing focuses on studying and analyzing how images can be used to make objects the center of visual communication. The intent is that the product and its visual communication therefore become strategically linked and inseparable and their fusion is what reaches out to people, engages them and defines their choices (a marketing mechanism is known as persuasionFathali M.

Marketing persuades consumer's buying behaviour and Visual Marketing enhances that by factors of recall, memory and identity. Growing trends in the usage of picture based websites and social networking platforms like Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, Timeline feature of Facebook justifies the fact that people want to believe what they see, and therefore, need for Visual Marketing. thumb Visual marketing includes all visual cues like logo, signage, sales tools, vehicles, uniforms, right to your Advertisements, Brochures, Informational DVDs, Websites, everything that meets the Public Eye.  History  Table showing the evolution of Visual Marketing in terms of Time-Perception-Critical interpretation ‚Äì Paolo Schianchi The roots of this way of interpreting objects lie in Susan Sontag‚Äôs essay Notes on \\"Camp\\", written back in the 1960s; the author points out that objects are not interesting in themselves but rather in the way they are represented, being the result of a series of considerations that touch upon the object's history, its symbolism, its manifestation and realization in the eyes of the beholder.Susan Sontag, Notes on \\"Camp\\", Partisan Review 1964 As it developed, visual marketing highlighted the masking of an object, which instead of just being a product, turns into the star of its own 'production\\", so it changes from itself into something else, at the precise moment it enters the market.Jim Bettman, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business: \\"Although vision is perhaps the primary human sensory modality, vision research is perhaps the most advanced of research on sensory systems, and marketers provide a multitude of visual information to consumers via ads, packaging, and other media\\" (...) According to Paolo Schianchi, architect and designer, an Italian visual marketing academic:P. Schianchi, Nuvole di estetica e prodotto, S. 39, ISRE Edizioni Salesiane, year XVII, No. 1, 2010 ‚Äú(...) Objects are: real, as what we see; visible - what they are made from; perfect - their classic identity; communication - their bond with taste; form and function - container and content; emotion - the story they can evoke; critical operation - the language that consecrates and exposes it; industrial operation - making them active and productive; image - the what and the how; anonymous - merely because it exits (...)‚Äú All of these components ‚Äì that belong to and define an objects from the viewpoint of the market and of the consumer ‚Äì are the research and planning nuances that encompass the scope of visual marketing. So, this branch \\"(...) acts on several levels of the design of an object: the idea (objects have to meet certain functions and be neutral, round, sharp-edged, eccentric shapes etc.); the communication (for a certain period in one geographic zone, then turned into a luxury item, at another time disguised as eco-friendly etc.) and in the end, the exhibition ‚Äì in a trade fair, in a showroom and at other events (the object is approachable but its context drops it into atmospheres as an unusual industrial find, an emotional dispenser of functions, unapproachable art and design object, etc.). (...)\\".P. Schianchi, Nuvole di estetica e prodotto, p. 39, ISRE Edizioni Salesiane, year XVII, n¬∞ 1, 2010 In the words of Umberto Galimberti, Italian philosopher and psychoanalystU. Galimberti, I miti del nostro tempo, Feltrinelli 2009 - p. 103 \\"(...) Even when there is no lack of money, the desire ‚Äì now defined by fashion ‚Äì does not refer so much to objects as to the myths surrounding them, and often the only thing being consumed is the myth itself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ (...)\\". This concept is taken up again by Gillo Dorfles in his book \\"Il feticcio quotidiano\\" (The daily fetish): \\"(...) This is why I believe I can say that it is now possible to talk about a new ergonomic standard, not connected to the height of a desk or to the pneumatic quality of padding but to the creation of that ‚Äúmythical image‚Äù that a design object must present if it is really right for the purpose it was designed for (...)\\"..G. Dorfles, Il feticcio quotidiano, Castelvecchi Editore, 2012, p. 138, edited by Massimo Carboni The mythology that covers objects to the point of becoming one with them, is decoded, in this branch through the study of various visual and verbal languages belonging to the groups of interest. So visual marketing draws the attention away from traditional targets to focus on ‚Äú...interest groups that are no longer broken down by age, gender, education or any other personal records and social contexts but by type of involvement, whether it be sports (golf or football fans), personal (wine connoisseurs or collectors), cultural (art and classical music lovers), etc. All these groups contain visual, verbal, sound, gesture, olfactory and formal codes that they refer to and use to communicate... ‚Äù Paolo Schianchi, I linguaggi del visual marketing: gli architetti non sono tutti uguali. in: B&O;, n. 356, year XXXVIII, p.28-29, Ed. Gruppo 24 Ore, Milano, 2012. So, the expressive group behaviours lie behind the new sub-alphabets whose decoding can be used to create direct marketing methods with the group itself. One of the people inspiring this almost anthropological approach is Marc Aug√©, who in his book ‚ÄúLe temps en ruines‚Äù (Time in ruins) notes that: ‚Äúthe world where image is omnipresent requires the reality to be reflected in its image...‚Äù. Marc Aug√©, Rovine e macerie, p. 131, Torino, Bollati Boringhieri 2004 Paolo Schianchi‚Äôs researchAntonella Camisasca, La forma che non t'aspetti. in: B&O;, n. 356, year XXXVIII, Ed. Gruppo 24 Ore, Milano, 2012 underscored how the act of putting together the image of the reality generated by each interest group is composed of language sets made of words, sounds, images, smells and shapes that give rise to various sub-alphabets when combined differently. If correctly decoded, these expressive elements become the means to get in touch with a group and direct a message inside itPaolo Schianchi, I linguaggi del visual marketing: gli architetti non sono tutti uguali. in: B&O;, n. 356, year XXXVIII, p.28-29, Ed. Gruppo 24 Ore, Milano, 2012. This aspect of visual marketing helps to create targeted marketing campaigns that go straight to the users‚Äô emotions and representations of reality, using their own expressive language The roots of this principle lie in Vil√©m Flusser's ‚ÄúInto the universe of technical images‚Äù (originally published as Ins Universum der technischen Bilder), where he claims: ‚Äú ... all ethics, all ontology, all epistemology will be excluded from the pictures, and it will become meaningless to ask whether something good or bad, real or artificial, true or false, or even what it means. The only remaining question is what I can experience...‚Äù.Vil√©m Flusser, Immagini, come la tecnologia ha cambiato la nostra percezione del mondo, p. 179, Roma, Fazi, 2009 This is how the author introduced the concept of the expressive emotion at the origin of visual and verbal sub-alphabets, which belong to each individual at the moment they become part of an interest group. Visual marketing has taken these concepts onboard and to communicate a product to a group it decodes their emotional and individual languages, because we now know that everyone lives‚Äú... a double life, where each person is the representation of themselves, becoming inseparable from the physical person, as objects are from their image...‚ÄùPaolo Schianchi, Design. La raffigurazione di se stesso, p. 19, Il Sole 24 Ore Business Media, 2010 Visual Marketing consultants plan around this, moving from the design of the object to its visual display, and in so doing creating the mythology around it. Theories on visual marketing have been developed by author and professor in Consumer Science, Michel Wedel.Visual Marketing, 2007. M. Wedel and F.G.M. Pieters (Eds.), New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Marketing and Consumer Psychology Series, C.P. Haugtvedt (series Editor)  Visual Marketing Types  When you consider that 65% of people are visual learners, 90% of information that comes to the brain is visual, and presentations with visual aides are 43% more persuasive, it makes sense to use Visual content types which people have an innate psychological resonance with.  Infographics  It is one of the most popular visual content format and we must use this visual markeing format. Not only do infographics communicate a ton of information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner, but they are also one of the most shared pieces of visual content.  Memes and Branded Quotes  Another must-have visual content type is the meme and/or branded quote. Currently this visual format are the most sharable content type over social media platforms. In this case, we used big, bold text in combination with an impactful image to attract viewers' attention as they scroll down their feeds.  Video:  Videos are the best visual marketing format on the web today. There are numerous types of videos that can enhance your business ‚Äì you could consider how-to videos, animated explainer videos, demonstrations or customer testimonials.  Images  Marketer Jeff Bullas cites that articles with images get 94% more views than those without. When you put some quality images within any content, people are more inclined to finish reading what you‚Äôve written.  Presentations  Presentation are not restricted to just the baordroom, now it is can be shared with world via sites like Slideshare. You can expand the outreach of your bisiness utlizing presentation. A great SlideShare presentation allows you to inform and communicate to your audience, no matter what device they are using.

Produced by the Armstrong works in Italy between 1914 and 1917, approximately 30-44 were built. Originally the Obice da 305/17 Modello 15 was a stationary coastal defense gun but was later adapted to a mobile siege artillery role. A number also served during World War II. History In 1908 the Italian coastal artillery analyzed reports from the Russo-Japanese War of the performance of their Armstrong howitzers that they had supplied to Japan and found them unsatisfactory. They then turned to the companies Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, St Chamond and Vickers-Terni for proposals for a howitzer. The Inspector General of Artillery chose the design from Armstrong- Pozzuoli, with modifications to the ammunition, and loading system. Design alt= The long barrel of the 305/17 was made of steel and was rifled with 60 left-hand constant twist grooves. Although the overall length of the barrel and breech was 19 calibers, the Italians designated their artillery by the length of the barrel only which was 17 calibers. The barrel was then inserted into a ring cradle which housed two cylinders of the hydraulic recoil mechanism and the pneumatic recuperator cylinder located above the barrel. The barrel was mounted on trunnions towards the middle and the wedge-shaped box trail carriage had a large open space behind the breech to allow for recoil, high angles of elevation and reloading. The weight of the barrel and breech was . The 305/17 had an interrupted screw breech and used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. Variants *Obice da 305/17 G Modello 1915 - The initial model was a stationary coastal defense gun which rested on a metal platform designed by General Garrone which allowed for 360¬∞ of traverse. The G in the guns designation stood for Garrone. For traverse the carriage pivoted in the center and there were four castor wheels at the edges of the carriage. *Obice da 305/17 G Modello 1916 - The Modello 1916 was a modified version which was lightened and simplified to allow the gun to be broken down into multiple loads and reassembled in the field to act as a mobile siege gun. For transport, it was broken down into the barrel, recoil system and ring cradle, top carriage and gun platform. Once onsite a pit could be dug for the pyramid-shaped earth anchor and then assembled with winches and ramps in 24 hours. *Obice da 305/17 G Modello 1917 - The Modello 1917 was also a mobile version designed to disassembled and used in a siege artillery role. A gun battery consisted of two howitzers with 8 wagons, 2 machine guns for defense, a utility wagon, and 5 artillery tractors. The wagons could be towed at and set up time remained 24 hours. *Obice da 305/17 D.S. - These guns were mounted on the same \\"De Stefano\\" carriage for land use and the resulting guns were classified by their size in millimeters 305, their length in calibers 17 and lastly by their carriage type DS which stood for De Stefano. The De Stefano carriage was a clever, but strange looking monstrosity which looked something like a child's 4-wheeled toy-horse when the gun barrel was elevated. The carriage was a large 4-wheeled box-trail design with two non-steerable wheels on the front and two castering wheels at the rear. The wheels were fitted with detachable grousers designed by major Crispino Bonagente for traction on soft ground and were towed in one piece by a Pavesi-Tolotti artillery tractor. When not on the move the grousers were removed and the steel wheels rode on an inclined set of steel rails when in firing position. The steel rails were mounted on a firing platform made of wooden beams which allowed the gun 360¬∞of traverse. When the gun fired recoil which was not absorbed by the recoil mechanism was transmitted to the wheels and the carriage rolled up the inclined rails and then rolled back into firing position. The box trail carriage was tall and wide enough that the breech of the gun was accessible at high angles of elevation without a pit being dug and the gun crew had a bucket and hoist for ammunition handling. Service World War I Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Italian Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. Indirect fire, interdiction and counter-battery fire emphasized the importance of long-range heavy artillery. In order to address the Italian Army's lack of long-range heavy artillery 254B, 254/40, 305/17, 305/40, and 305/46 Naval Guns were converted to land use. The first howitzers entered service with units of the coastal artillery in 1914, with 12 at La Spezia, 4 at La Maddalena and 4 at Messina. In October 1917, 38 pieces were available in the three versions. A number of guns were disassembled and redeployed to the Alpine front to act as siege artillery. After the loss of 9 guns following the Battle of Caporetto, another 18 were produced between 1 July 1918 and 30 June 1919, thus reaching the total of 44 guns, of which 8 were in reserve. Spanish Civil War In 1937, 5 pieces were delivered to the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War. World War II In 1939, 10 Modello 16 and 17 Modello 17's were in service. These armed the 540th battery of the 22nd Artillery Group of the Guardia alla Frontiera (G.a.F.), a battery of the XXIX and one of the XXXI Group of the 24th artillery Regiment G.a.F. and the 4th Army Army Artillery Grouping. These were used in the French Campaign, the defense of Naples and in the defense of the Sicilian coast. Another 16 guns on a shielded coastal mount were supplied to 4 coastal batteries of the Regia Marina, manned by MILMART personnel. Some guns remained in service in the post-war period and were retired in 1959. Photo Gallery File:Italian heavy gun.jpgA 305/17 modello 16 howitzer on a De Stefano carriage with Bonagente grousers.

Early life Deepak Ram's great- grandparents were brought to South Africa to work on sugar cane plantations as indentured labourers. He was thus born in South Africa to second generation immigrants during the apartheid era in the 60s. A few weeks after his birth the family home in Sophiatown, a racially mixed area, was bulldozed under Group Areas Act for effecting racial segregation. His family then settled in Lenasia - a township south of Johannesburg earmarked for those of Indian origin. His earliest influences were the Jazz records his brothers listened to and the Bollywood and Indian music his parents listened to. His first flute was fashioned out of a drainpipe with six holes drilled arbitrarily on the sides. Career Deepak Ram first traveled to India at the age of 17 where he received training in classical Indian music under the tutelage renowned flautist Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia and the late Shri Suryakant Limaye.

The ISDS Recommended Practice (DNV- RP-D201) was launched in 2008 by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), the Norwegian classification society. DNV Offshore Standard OS-D203 launched in April 2010. Since the ISDS standard was first published by DNV, it has been applied by several oil companies, equipment suppliers, ship and rig owners. The ISDS standard focuses on how to set up and run a project and how to develop system and software quality assurance processes that will last the lifetime of the unit (ship, rig etc.). It provides a framework for working systematically to achieve the required reliability, availability, maintainability and safety for the integrated unit of software dependent systems. The process typically starts when owners are specifying their requirements, either for a new project or an enhancement to an existing system. In collaboration with DNV specialists, the owner can assess the integrator and the suppliers to ensure they have the prerequisites for delivering good quality software. One of the innovations of ISDS is that it assigns systems and software responsibilities to one or more of the roles: owner, operator, system integrator, suppliers, and independent verifier. Another important feature of ISDS is that it requires the designation of a system integrator. This can be the shipbuilder, the major automation supplier, or a specialized contractor. The ISDS defines the activities to be performed by the system integrator. These activities focus on managing requirements and interfaces among the different systems. The ISDS-required practices for suppliers focus on ensuring that software quality is built into vendors‚Äô products through systematic reviews, inspections, and testing. All of these requirements are generally accepted good practices in software engineering. Nothing revolutionary is demanded. Among the rig-owners, Songa Offshore, Seadrill and Dolphin Drilling have been early adopters of the ISDS approach. DNV conducted a pilot project of the recommended practice version of ISDS with Seadrill (in Houston) in 2009. Several improvements were made to Seadrill's new build and operations practices as a result of this initiative, and a story on this has been published in Offshore Engineer. DNV has been engaged with Dolphin Drilling in an effort that will lead to the issuance of the first ISDS class certificate, see article by Steve Marshall in Upstream Online. DNV is engaged by the Daewoo Ship and Marine Engineering (DSME), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) yards in South Korea, for drilling units they are building for Songa Offshore, Fred Olsen Energy (Dolphin Drilling), Statoil and Diamond Drilling. The owners have specified a full scope for DNV follow-up on ISDS, including systems for emergency shut-down, fire and gas, BOP control, drilling control, pipe/riser handling, heave compensation & tensioning, bulk storage, drilling fluid circulation, cementing, dynamic positioning, power management and integrated automation. See article published in Offshore Magazine for the Songa Offshore units. In September 2013, DNV announced the contract with Diamond Drilling, the first American rig-owner to apply ISDS for a new-build project. The ISDS methodology has been developed starting with best industry practices from aerospace, telecom and automotive industries, and adapting the requirements to fit the offshore and maritime domains. An article published in Oil & Gas Journal gives an industry perspective to ISDS. In July 2015, the Songa Equinox, the first of Songa Offshore‚Äôs four new sixth generation Cat-D semisubmersible rigs, met the requirements of integrated software dependent systems (ISDS) standard (DNV-OS-D203) to prevent software glitches. The aim is to enable full tracking of the quality and version control of all integrated software systems, so that the yard and the user knows the status of all systems, the latest updates, if any still require close-out at the yard, at any given time. Noticeable improvements to the typical complex cyber dependent vessel newbuilding lifecycle were observed.

Frankel believed that the objects striven for in the contest of 1848 had been attained, and that the Jews no longer had separate political interests. He therefore considered that the time had arrived for them to undertake a scientific investigation of their history and literature. The first seventeen volumes of the \\"Monatsschrift\\" were edited by Frankel, who was succeeded by the historian Heinrich Graetz. The latter edited vols. xviii. to xxxvi. inclusive, being assisted by Pinkus Frankl of Berlin in vols. xxxiii. to xxxv. Publication was stopped in 1887, but was resumed in 1892, with Marcus Brann and David Kaufmann as joint editors (vols. xxxvii. to xliii.). Upon Kaufmann's death (1899) Brann became sole editor. Since Jan., 1904, the \\"Monatsschrift\\" has appeared as the organ of the Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Wissenschaft des Judenthums. The \\"Monatsschrif\\" was first published in Dresden. Some volumes were then issued in Krotoschin and some in Berlin; but the greatest number appeared in Breslau. A complete table of contents for the first seventeen volumes is appended to vol. xvii., and a similar table for the years 1869 to 1887 is given at the end of vol. xxxvi. This table has been published separately also.

Its length measures 3.1 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, largely obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns above, which only about half of the last turn projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, slopingly shouldered at the summit. The shoulder bears the first of the four stronger tuberculate spiral ridges. Connections that join the tubercles in the spiral series are a little more strongly developed than those that link them vertically‚Äîthe spaces enclosed between them being deep squarish pits. The tubercles are very prominent and rounded; there are about 16 upon the second, 20 upon the third, and 26 upon the penultimate turn. The axial series slants retractively from the posterior suture. The sutures are deep and broad, considerably wider than the spaces between the keels. The periphery of the body whorl is deeply channeled, the channel marked by a weak extension of the axial bars that terminate at the first supraperipheral keel.

It is marked by seven strong moderately raised spiral keels that, like the channels that separate them, diminish regularly in width from the periphery to the umbilical area; the last, the eighth, immediately behind the columella, being less distinct and considerably broader than the rest. The channels between the keels are about equal to the keels in width and are crossed by numerous very slender raised threads, which extend up on the sides of the keels but do not cross them. About five of these threads fall in the space between two tubercles on the spire, in the first supra-peripheral groove. The oval aperture is large, effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is rather thick, not showing the external sculpture within. The columella is somewhat twisted, revolute anteriorly, re-enforced by the attenuated base, and provided with a weak fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a callus‚Äîwhich joins the columella with the posterior angle of the aperture and renders the periostracum almost complete.

These activities may include desertion, illegal scuttling, theft of the ship or cargo, and committing any actions which may not be in the shipowner's best interests. As barratry is misconduct against the shipowner (or demise charterer), only these parties have locus standi to sue in barratry; any affected cargo-owners will normally claim against the shipowner (or demise charterer) for breach of the contract of carriage.Modern Maritime Law - Alexa Mandaraka-Shappard Description Barratry is usually considered a crime against the ship's owner. Therefore, if the owner himself chooses to wreck the ship, no crime is committed, as the owner simply destroyed his own property, though this can still be considered a crime against any other owners. Also, harm to the crew can qualify as barratry regardless of who damaged the vessel. Throughout the 19th century, courts in the United States struggled with defining and understanding the law. Courts have concluded that negligence is not enough to qualify as barratry, but that it instead requires an intentional act and an intent to defraud. Similarly, deviating from the assigned course is also not by itself barratry. It is different from the crime of mutiny, where mutineers disobey the commanding officer, who remains loyal to the ship's owner (which is not the case in barratry). Case law Patapsco Insurance Company v. Coulter, a U.S. Supreme Court case, explored the meaning of barratry in detail. In the case, a ship was planned to sail to Gibraltar to sell flour, and then use the profits to purchase goods in Marseille. However, at Gibraltar, a fire started aboard ship, destroying the ship and the cargo inside. The plaintiffs argued that the crew could have saved the ship but failed. The courts ruled, however, that failure to stop a fire, even if negligent, does not constitute barratry. Fire was ruled the cause of the cargo's destruction, not barratry, and the insurance company was required to pay. National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Republic of China et al considered how barratry applies during periods of civil war and insurrection., In the 1940s, the United States sold 13 ships to the Republic of China, the nationalist government that controlled China at the time. During the Chinese Civil War, the communist People's Republic of China took control of mainland China and forced the nationalist Republic of China to Taiwan. When the nationalist government fled to Taiwan in 1949, six of the ships were at ports in mainland China while a seventh was at sea. The nationalist government ordered all seven ships to Taiwan, but none complied, and all seven turned their ships over to the Communist government. Although the government's insurance policy excluded losses due to civil war, insurrection or mutiny, it did cover barratry. The court ruled that all seven of these ships were a case of barratry, not mutiny, as the captains ordered the ships to raise the Communist flag. Penalties Until 1888, barratry was a capital offense in the United States. Juries routinely refused to convict people of the crime, even if their guilt was obvious, because they did not agree with the death penalty for barratry. That came to a head with the destruction of in 1885. Mary Celeste had become infamous since being discovered adrift in 1872, in good condition with no one on board. In 1885, her final owner, Captain G. C. Parker, was accused of barratry, in that he deliberately ran her aground and burned her off the coast of Haiti, and then made an exorbitant insurance claim for a non-existent cargo. Despite the obvious attempt at insurance fraud, and clear evidence of his guilt, five of the twelve jurors refused to convict Parker, to avoid condemning him to death. That led to the death penalty for the crime being abolished three years after the trial. Barratry in fiction * In Tom Clancy's 1984 novel The Hunt for Red October, the character Admiral Foster remarks that the apparent theft of the eponymous Soviet submarine Red October by her Captain Marko Ramius and his officers, with the intention to defect with the submarine to the United States, constitutes barratry and not mutiny.

It involves delaying the sound emanating from one or more drivers (greater than 2-way) to correct the transient response, improve accuracy and, in non-coaxial drivers, improve the directivity or lobe tilting at the crossover frequencies. It employs adjusting the front-to back spacing of the individual drivers so that the sound output is truly simultaneous.  Background  In 1975 Ed LongEd Long (audio engineer) in cooperation with Ronald J. Wickersham invented the first technique to Time-Align a loudspeaker systems. In 1976 Long presented \\"A Time-Align Technique for Loudspeakers System Design\\"http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2283 at the 54th AES convention demonstrating the use of the Time-Align generator to design improved crossover networks for multi-way loudspeakers systems. This technique relied on subjective evaluation of various square pulses swept through the crossover frequencies. The Time-Align Generator locked the pulse on an oscilloscope so that it could be viewed. The Time-Align technique was employed by Long on the UREI 813 Studio monitor introduced in 1977. Long also manufactured near field studio monitors from the late 1970s through the 90's utilizing the Time-Align technique. In 1977 Long trademarked Time-Align and later trademarked its derivatives, Time Aligned and Time Alignment. Long Licensed the Time-Align trademark to UREI, Bag End Loudspeakers and others. Since hi-fi audio requires that the loudspeaker be capable of faithful reproduction of the recorded material, it follows that a loudspeaker that better covers the audio spectrum will have better hi-fi performance. Therefore, most hi-fi loudspeakers employ multiple drivers to cover the audio spectrum satisfactorily. At the very least, such a loudspeaker may be 2-way employing a woofer (or mid-range/mid-woofer) and a tweeter. Higher end loudspeakers may be 3-way or even 4-way. For the sake of this article and simplicity, a 2-way speaker system will be assumed - consisting of a woofer and a tweeter. Since the woofer covers the lower-end of the audio spectrum and the tweeter covers the upper-end, the dividing point between the two being the crossover frequency, it is of utmost importance that, at the crossover frequency the outputs of both drivers should acoustically sum so as to be seamless, without any peaks or dips, otherwise the loudspeaker is said to colour the sound. A typical characteristic of a 2-way speaker is that at the crossover frequency, due to the physical distance between the centres of the woofer and tweeter, the sound that emanates from the combination is not omni- directional, but lobed. Within the region of the lobe the sound level, at the crossover frequency is much higher as compared to outside the lobe. Therefore loudspeaker designers try to make the main lobe as fat as possible, by using drivers that are as small as possible in diameter so as to allow closer spacing between them. However, the lowest frequency of interest (bass) puts a lower limit to the woofer's diameter. Therefore, such speakers will always have lobing.  Lobe tilting  A typical 2-way speaker uses a woofer and a tweeter as mentioned earlier. Usually the tweeter is much smaller and thinner than a woofer. What this means is that the radiating surfaces (at the voice- coil or the dome/dust-cap depending on design, also known as the \\"acoustic centre\\") of the drivers are not in the same plane - the tweeter's radiating surface is usually much forward of the woofer when both are mounted to the same flat panel. Even though this physical offset may be of the order of 20-40mm, at typical crossover frequencies (‚â• 1 kHz), this offset is enough to cause tilting of the main lobe. The image below shows this: Image:TM lobe time aligned.gif The woofer is the larger of the two, located below the tweeter. This is the most commonly used 2-way configuration. As can be seen the tweeter is much thinner and its acoustic centre is ahead of the woofer's acoustic centre. Due to this, at the crossover frequency since both drivers are producing the same frequency, the sound waves from the tweeter arrive at the listening position P earlier than those from the woofer. Due to this, at P there is non-ideal summing of the waves (they might reinforce or cancel out). Thus the main lobe points away from P towards a position P' (which for this particular speaker is lower than P). \\"Article by Rane discussing the Linkwitz- Riley crossover, time-alignment, lobing and correction of lobe tilt in TM or MT speaker configurations.\\"  Correction of lobe-tilting with time-alignment  For most purposes the tilted lobe poses no problems and indeed many speaker systems do not use time alignment. However, there is a type of crossover called the LR4 or LR2 crossover, which has certain unique features that make time-alignment worthwhile for speakers that use it. This particular crossover has the property that at the crossover frequency the electrical summing is flat (i.e., there is no peak or dip) and the signals being sent to the woofer and tweeter are always in phase (180¬∞ out of phase in the LR2 case, which is corrected by simply inverting the tweeter's signal). When used with a loudspeaker that is time-aligned, the loudspeaker's main lobe now points exactly forward (i.e., straight) and does not have a 3dB peak in response. This makes the LR2 or LR4 crossovers ideal for audio as compared to the Butterworth type. Even without a LR crossover, it is worthwhile to have the main lobe point forward so that the speakers will illuminate the listening position evenly, resulting in better overall system performance (such as imaging or audibility). \\"Article by Rane, sections Linkwitz-Riley crossover and Time or Phase Correction.\\"  Electrical time-alignment  In this technique (usually) the tweeter's signal is phase-shifted (usually a delay since tweeter is ahead of the woofer). This phase shift introduces an equivalent time shift in the tweeter's sound wave such that it corrects the time difference between the woofer and tweeter due to the physical offset. With a variable phase-shift filter, it becomes very easy to time align almost any speaker without having to physically alter anything. This method is also much easier and convenient over physically time-aligning the drivers. \\"ESP article discussing effects of time-delay, phase and time-alignment\\" However, acoustic measurement is almost always required in this case, since the phase adjustment cannot be done by hearing alone.  Physical time-alignment  In this technique the drivers are physically offset such that their acoustic centres lie in the same physical plane. This technique is used when no other means of time alignment are available or meant to be used. It simplifies setup for the end user in that they do not need any special electronics to align the drivers. However, this technique requires that the exact depths of the acoustic centres be known at design time, so that the physical offset may be introduced in the front panel of the speaker where the drivers mount. A common way to do this is so that the front-panel has a \\"step\\" (as shown in the above image) where the tweeter mounts at some distance behind the woofer. This step can cause more errors in summing than the time delay between the drivers due to the diffraction of the tweeter's sound waves around the step. \\"ESP article discussing effects of time-delay, phase and time-alignment, section Conclusion\\" Sloping and rounding the edges of the step helps in reducing diffraction, but it cannot be eliminated completely. Also, the more gradual the slope, greater is the vertical separation between the drivers, which in turn again causes thinning of the lobe (i.e., increase in vertical directivity) at the crossover frequency. Another way to introduce physical time-alignment without having to physically shift the tweeter backwards is to tilt the speaker itself upwards (or have the front-panel sloping instead of vertical). This method will cause the physical on-axis plane itself to be tilted upwards - so it virtually brings the physical plane in line with the required on-axis plane. However, now the listening position is off-axis relative to either driver at all frequencies. This is the simplest of all methods (especially tilting the speaker itself upwards) in that it can be done for any speaker and lends itself more easily to setting up the speakers by trial-and-error.

Early life He was born in Dunfermline, Scotland. He was deputy head boy at Currie High School. In 2008 he embarked on full-time study at the University of Edinburgh while developing as a rugby player. He graduated with a law degree in 2013. He had impressed in the 2010‚Äì11 season as a Scotland age-grade internationalist and his part in Currie's recent rise to prominence, domestically in Premier 1 and the British and Irish Cup. Before signing, Scott represented Scotland at under-19 and under-20 in 2009 and 2010 respectively. He played for Edinburgh's district intestate under-17 and under-18 teams. Club career In April 2011 Scott joined Edinburgh as an elite development player. He made his competitive d√©but on 2 September 2011 against Cardiff Blues. His first try came against 2010‚Äì11 Celtic League winners Munster after he dummied and cut inside, before palming off two Munster defenders to score under the posts. Since then he has become a familiar feature for Edinburgh, combining his upbringing as a stand-off with his strength in the tackle to great effect as a play-making centre with an eye for the try line. Having become a regular feature in the Edinburgh Rugby midfield, Scott signed a contract extension in October 2012 that will keep him at the club until 2015. By the middle of January 2016 he had played 70 times for Edinburgh and had scored 14 tries. On 16 January 2016, an announcement that Scott had signed for Aviva Premiership side Gloucester, to join for the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season. His last match for Edinburgh was against the Cardiff Blues on 7 May 2016. On 21 February 2018, Scott re-signed with his hometown club Edinburgh back in the Pro14, on a two-year deal ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season . On 29 April 2020 it was confirmed Scott will join English side Leicester Tigers from the 2021‚Äì21 season. International career Before going pro, Scott represented Scotland at under-19 and under-20 in 2009 and 2010 respectively. He made his age-grade international debut in the 55‚Äì13 success against Italy at Lasswade, Edinburgh, in March 2009, followed by the Dourdan match against France a month later. In 2010 he was recalled to the representative set-up for Scotland's under-20 6 Nations, playing in all but one match, featuring as a replacement in each of the four 6NC matches before playing in a further five Junior world Championship matches in Argentina. He made a try-scoring debut for Scotland A in February 2012 in the 35‚Äì0 win over England Saxons at Netherdale. The following month he gained his first international cap, coming on as a replacement in the RBS Six Nations match versus Ireland at the Aviva Stadium.

The issue was whether a provincial statute which altered the contractual liabilities of a benevolent organization, reducing its financial obligations to two widows, was within the constitutional authority of the province of Quebec under the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867). It was the first case where the Judicial Committee examined in detail the interplay between the list of federal powers in s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and the list of provincial powers in s. 92 of the Act.Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92. The Judicial Committee held that the legislation was within provincial jurisdiction as a matter of local and private interest, coming under section 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The statute did not intrude on federal jurisdiction over bankruptcy and insolvency, under s. 91(21) of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Facts  L'Union St-Jacques was a benevolent institution in Montreal, founded under provincial law. One of its purposes was to provide annuities to surviving widows of its deceased members, as governed by the contract of membership. However, it found that its annuity commitments exceeded its financial capacities, and if it made the payments as set out in the contract, it would run out of funds., Preamble To deal with this problem, the Legislature of Quebec enacted An Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal. The Act authorised the Union to make block payments of $200 to each of the surviving widows, replacing the annuities, which were to have been paid at the rate of 7s. 6d. per week for life. The Act also provided that if the Union's financial position improved, it then could make up the arrears owing to the widows under the original terms of the contract.Act to relieve L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal, ss. 1-3. Following the passage of this Act, the Union voted to take advantage of its provisions. Two of the four widows eligible for benefits agreed to accept the block sum of $200 instead of the amounts provided under the contract. The other two widows insisted on receiving the contractual benefits, and challenged the reduction in payments in the courts. Decisions of the Quebec courts The two widows brought their action in the Circuit Court of Montreal. As part of their court action, they challenged the constitutionality of the provincial Act which authorised the lower payments, arguing that it was not within provincial authority under s. 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. They argued that the provincial Act in fact dealt with \\"Bankruptcy and Insolvency\\", which are matters of exclusive federal jurisdiction under s. 91(21) of the Constitution Act, 1867. In response, the Union argued that the Act was authorised by s. 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which gives the provinces power to legislate with respect to \\"All Matters of a merely local and Private nature in the Province.\\" On 30 November 1870, Justice Torrance of the Circuit Court accepted the widows' argument and held that the Act was not within the constitutional authority of the Province.B√©lisle v. L'Union St. Jacques (1870), 15 LC Jur 212 (QC Cir Ct). The Union then appealed to the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side). On 20 September 1872, that Court dismissed the appeal, by a 3-2 majority (Duval C.J, Drummond and Monk JJ., Caron and Badgley JJ., dissenting). The majority agreed that the Act dealt with bankruptcy and insolvency and was not within provincial jurisdiction.L'Union St-Jacques de Montr√©al v. B√©lisle (1874), 20 LC Jur 29, 5 RLOS 622 (QC QB).  Decision of the Judicial Committee  The Union then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, at that time the court of last resort for the colonies of the British Empire, including Canada. (There was no appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, as that court had not yet been created.) The Union was represented by Sir William Harcourt, QC, and Mr Bompas. The widows were represented by Judah P. Benjamin, QC, and F.W. Gibbs. Lord Selborne gave the decision for the Committee. He ruled that the statute was constitutional, as a local and private matter, within provincial jurisdiction under s. 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. It dealt solely with the affairs of the Union, which operated in Montreal, and whose members were clearly within provincial jurisdiction. The Act took note of a particular state of affairs of the Union and provided a remedy. The subject matter of the Act was clearly local and private in nature.L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal at p. 35 (AC). Bankruptcy and insolvency, on the other hand, is a general matter, providing a legal system for the administration of estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent. The federal Parliament had not enacted any legislation under this head of power at the time of the events, and to suggest that the mere possibility that Parliament would enact such legislation in future should take the matter out of provincial jurisdiction \\"... would go very far to destroy that [provincial] power in all cases.\\"L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal at pp. 36-37 (AC). Lord Selborne went on to describe the extent to which the federal power could reach: Lord Selborne noted that there was no proof that the Union was insolvent, and in fact the tendency of the Act was to keep it from becoming insolvent. Nor did the provincial Act terminate the Union, wind it up, or distribute its assets to its creditors. The provincial Act therefore did not deal with bankruptcy and insolvency and did not intrude on federal jurisdiction.L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal at pp. 37-38. He concluded that the Committee should advise Her Majesty that the appeal be allowed and the original suit be dismissed, with no order as to costs.L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal at p. 38.  Significance of the decision  L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal v B√©lisle was the first case in which the Judicial Committee gave any detailed analysis of the interplay between s. 91 and s. 92 of the Constitution Act 1867, which are at the heart of the constitutional division of powers between the federal government and the provinces in Canada. (In a previous case, R v Coote, the Judicial Committee had dismissed a constitutional challenge to a provincial statute, but the Committee did not give any detailed reasons on the constitutional point.) Lord Selborne's definition of the bankruptcy and insolvency power has been described in later jurisprudence as declaring that the Parliament of Canada \\"has a very wide discretion and is not necessarily limited in the exercise of that discretion by reference to the particular provisions of bankruptcy legislation in England prior to the date of the BNA Act.\\"Reference re legislative jurisdiction of Parliament of Canada to enact the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, as amended by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act Amendment Act, [1936 SCR 384.] The federal Department of Justice included this decision in the three volume collection of constitutional decisions of the Judicial Committee which the Department published when appeals to the Judicial Committee were abolished.

The theorem states that a univalent function defined on the unit disc, fixing the point 0, maps every disk z < r onto a starlike domain for r ‚â§ tanh œÄ/4. The largest r for which this is true is called the radius of starlikeness of the function. Statement  Let f be a univalent holomorphic function on the unit disc D such that f(0) = 0. Then for all r ‚â§ tanh œÄ/4, the image of the disc z < r is starlike with respect to 0, , i.e. it is invariant under multiplication by real numbers in (0,1). An inequality of Grunsky If f(z) is univalent on D with f(0) = 0, then :\\\\left\\\\log {zf^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over f(z)}\\\\right\\\\le \\\\log {1+z\\\\over 1-z}. Taking the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm, this implies the two inequalities :\\\\left{zf^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over f(z)}\\\\right\\\\le {1+z\\\\over 1-z} and :\\\\left\\\\arg {zf^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over f(z)}\\\\right \\\\le \\\\log {1+z\\\\over 1-z}. For fixed z, both these equalities are attained by suitable Koebe functions : g_w(\\\\zeta)={\\\\zeta\\\\over (1-\\\\overline{w}\\\\zeta)^2}, where w = 1. Proof originally proved these inequalities based on extremal techniques of Ludwig Bieberbach. Subsequent proofs, outlined in , relied on the Loewner equation. More elementary proofs were subsequently given based on Goluzin's inequalities, an equivalent form of Grunsky's inequalities (1939) for the Grunsky matrix. For a univalent function g in z > 1 with an expansion : g(z) = z + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \\\\cdots. Goluzin's inequalities state that : \\\\left\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\lambda_i\\\\lambda_j \\\\log {g(z_i)-g(z_j)\\\\over z_i-z_j}\\\\right \\\\le \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\lambda_i\\\\overline{\\\\lambda_j}\\\\log {z_i\\\\overline{z_j}\\\\over z_i\\\\overline{z_j}-1}, where the zi are distinct points with zi > 1 and Œªi are arbitrary complex numbers. Taking n = 2. with Œª1 = ‚Äì Œª2 = Œª, the inequality implies : \\\\left \\\\log {g^\\\\prime(\\\\zeta)g^\\\\prime(\\\\eta) (\\\\zeta-\\\\eta)^2\\\\over (g(\\\\zeta)-g(\\\\eta))^2}\\\\right\\\\le \\\\log {1-\\\\zeta\\\\overline{\\\\eta}^2\\\\over (\\\\zeta^2 -1 )(\\\\eta^2 -1)}. If g is an odd function and Œ∑ = ‚Äì Œ∂, this yields : \\\\left \\\\log {\\\\zeta g^\\\\prime(\\\\zeta) \\\\over g(\\\\zeta)}\\\\right \\\\le {\\\\zeta^2 + 1\\\\over \\\\zeta^2 -1}. Finally if f is any normalized univalent function in D, the required inequality for f follows by taking : g(\\\\zeta)=f(\\\\zeta^{-2})^{-{1\\\\over 2}} with z=\\\\zeta^{-2}. Proof of the theorem Let f be a univalent function on D with f(0) = 0. By Nevanlinna's criterion, f is starlike on z < r if and only if : \\\\Re {zf^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over f(z)} \\\\ge 0 for z < r. Equivalently :\\\\left\\\\arg {zf^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over f(z)}\\\\right \\\\le {\\\\pi\\\\over 2}. On the other hand by the inequality of Grunsky above, : \\\\left\\\\arg {zf^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over f(z)}\\\\right\\\\le \\\\log {1+z\\\\over 1-z}. Thus if : \\\\log {1+z\\\\over 1-z} \\\\le {\\\\pi\\\\over 2}, the inequality holds at z. This condition is equivalent to :z\\\\le \\\\tanh {\\\\pi\\\\over 4} and hence f is starlike on any disk z < r with r ‚â§ tanh œÄ/4.

History The traditional centers of residence and culture for Bosnian Canadians are located in Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton and Calgary. Numerous Bosnian language newspapers and other periodicals are published in many states. The largest Bosnian organisation in Canada is the Congress of North American Bosniaks. Religion The Bosnian Islamic Association Gazi Husrev-Beg was founded in November 1977 under the name 'Association of Islamic Community Gazi Husrev-Beg'. It has been operating under its current name (BIAGH) ever since 1995. The primary reason of its foundation was to respond to the religious needs of its members. That was made possible through a full- time imam, who has been serving this community uninterruptedly since June 1982. The BIAGH caters to the needs of Bosniaks that pertain to Bosniak tradition, folklore, sport and different creative workshops.

Early life Alberto de Gainza Paz was the eldest of four children born to Alberto de Gainza Lynch and Zelmira Rosa Paz D√≠az in Buenos Aires. Both parents belonged to powerful families in Argentina; especially Zelmira, who was the daughter of Jos√© Clemente Paz (deputy, diplomat and founder of the newspaper La Prensa), and Zelmira Diaz Gallardo. Alberto, surrounded by powerful contacts and a member of high society in Buenos Aires, frequented many exclusive meetings and parties, and frequented the Hippodrome in Palermo. In 1921, he received a law degree from the University of Buenos Aires. He married Elvira Castro Soto, and had 8 children: Elvira, Alberto, Maximo, Ezekiel, Joseph, Angelica, Zelmira Gainza and Jorge de Castro. Career In 1943, Gainza Paz assumed the role of editor of the newspaper La Prensa from his uncle, Ezequiel Pedro Paz, who retired for health reasons. La Prensa was suspended for five days in 1944, after criticizing the government's health program. Gainza Paz and five other newspaper editors were arrested in 1945, charged with conspiring against the government. In January 1951, the Peronist government forced the newspaper to suspend publication, through its control of newspaper distribution. That March the Congress ordered the arrest of Gainza Paz, who was already in exile in Uruguay. In 1951, Paz was quoted The Citizen- Advertiser, Auburn NY, December 5, 1951, page 4 in a New York newspaper: \\"I am not saying that what happened in my country might some day happen here, but I will warn you that it is much easier to fight to keep the freedoms you have than to fight to regain the freedoms you have lost.\\" He returned to La Prensa in 1956, the year after Juan Per√≥n was deposed.

It was written by Richard and Esther Shapiro.  Plot  California, June 1959. Paige Farrell (Lindsay Frost), a wealthy young femme fatale, has just graduated from high school and is now celebrating at rich classmate Lee's (Dylan Walsh) mansion. He tries to seduce her, but Paige ignores his affections due to her relationship with working class boy Michael Stefanos (Grant Show). Michael himself is quite popular with the opposite sex as well, as even Paige's mousy best friend Ellen Reese (Cynthia Gibb) admits that she fantasizes about him. At the same party, aspiring singer Linda Rosen (Jane Krakowski) - known for having had many bed partners - tries to perform a song, but stage fright causes her to be bullied off the stage. Vulnerable, she gives into inexperienced Alex Twining's (Jace Alexander) attempts to court her. They are about to have sex in a motel, when Linda starts to vomit, ruining the night. Later at night, some of the students drive home and get into a car accident, killing Phillip and Cecily, a beloved couple who were set to marry. Ben Kirkland (Steven Weber), who owned the car, feels guilty for having allowed them to drive the car even though they were drunk. Sixteen months later in New England, the group is now focussing on their future. Paige's powerful and intimidating father Matthew (Ronny Cox) is not satisfied with his daughter's boyfriend Michael, who now works in a garage with high school friend Virgil Hawkins (Eriq La Salle). When he finds out that Paige and Michael are engaged, he tries to prevent his daughter from marrying a garage worker by firing Michael's father (who previously worked for him). Michael is enraged that his father has been fired because of a personal conflict, and promises to one day destroy Matthew. Paige, however, continues to support her father and breaks the engagement. Along with Virgil, Michael comes up with plans to destroy Farrell's business, but his father warns him not to get involved with him. Nevertheless, Michael gets closer to the Farrell office through sleeping with Ellen, who now works as his secretary. Quickly, Paige starts to miss Michael and starts to doubt about her father's integrity at work. She arranges a passionate weekend with Michael at the beach, which abruptly ends when Paige announces that she will marry Lee, and move to Boston. Heartbroken, Michael merges with Farrell's biggest competition: Bartman. Meanwhile, Ben and Alex are upset with the newly announced engagement as well, and aspire to break up the couple. Ellen has other worries, as she realizes that she is pregnant. Michael promises to marry her as soon as she has money, which he tells her he can arrange if she steals personal information from Farrell. Ellen is offended that Michael is asking such from her, and realizes now that she is a simple tool for him to get closer to Farrell. At Paige and Lee's wedding, Ellen enrages Michael by informing him that she will get an abortion. When Lee gets in the middle, Michael throws a fight, shocking all the guests. Michael later apologizes to everyone, and makes peace with the wedding, as does Ben. At the end, Michael and Ellen announce their engagement, and Ben, Alex and Virgil leave town for the South.

She was the daughter of Johan Bj√∂rnsson Printz, governor of New Sweden, and she married her father's successor, governor Johan Papegoja. She is the most well documented and known woman of New Sweden. Meixner, Esther Chilstrom (1965)The Governor's daughter: The story of Armegott Printz (Chester, Pa.: Wilber C. Kreibel Inc.) Life Armegot Printz was born in Bottnaryd, Sm√•land, Sweden. She was the daughter of the Swedish noble Johan Printz, colonel lieutenant of the V√§stg√∂ta cavalry, and the German Elisabet Bock. She, as well as her mother and siblings, accompanied her father to Germany during his participation in the Thirty Years' War in the army of Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. In 1642, after her father's appointment as governor of the Swedish colony New Sweden in America, she followed her father to America in the company of her siblings and stepmother, where they arrived in February 1643. Alf √Öberg (2000) Kvinnor i Nya Sverige (Natur & Kultur, Stockholm) New Sweden In New Sweden, her father had The Printzhof manor built as their residence at Tinicum Island. In 1645, the poor noble Johan Papegoja arrived to the colony with permission from Per Brahe to marry Armegot. After the marriage took place, her spouse was given a position in the colony by her father and the couple settled in Fort Christina, where they had four sons. Armegot Printz was described as dominant, proud and willful, and was said to have totally dominated the relationship. In 1653, Papepgoja replaced her father as governor so Armegot was given the position of first lady of the colony. When her husband was replaced by Johan Risingh and returned to Sweden, Armegot remained in the colony to manage her father's properties. She also stayed in Fort Christina, where she kept control of the staff and retained the position of first lady until Risingh managed to have her removed to Printzhof. After this, five officials turned in their notices and wished to join Armegot's service instead. Risingh persuaded them to stay, but blamed the conflict on the influential position of Armegot and wrote to Sweden for a wife to undermine her status. Dutch In 1655, however, New Sweden was conquered by the Dutch. The Printzhof, where Armegot had allowed her neighbours to hide their valuables, was looted. When her possession of Printzhof was questioned by the Dutch, she had her ownership of Printzhof, as well as her possession of Fort Tinicum, confirmed by the Dutch governor in New Amsterdam. In 1662, she sold Printzhof to Dutch merchant Joost de la Grange (1623-1664). She travelled to the Netherlands to collect her payment, but was not paid. She visited her family in Sweden, and upset the local church authorities by her refusal to submit to her husband. In 1663, she returned to America to claim the payment for Printzhof, which was now owned by de la Grange's widow's new husband Andrew Carr. The process was drawn out for years. Meanwhile, she resided at Printztorp (now Chester, Pennsylvania), where she managed an inn, a tavern and a liquor distillery. Death In 1675, Printzhof was given back to her, and the year after, she sold it and returned to Sweden. She spent her remaining life travelling between the estates of her children and died at L√§ck√∂ Castle. References Related Reading *Benson, Adolph B. and Naboth Hedin, eds.

Mukundan. Widely regarded as the author's magnum opus, the novel vividly describes the political and social background of Mah√© (Mayyazhi), the former French colony, in the past, in a mystical way.\\"Malayalam novelettes in translation\\" The novel was translated into English and French, both the versions winning accolades.\\"Making mischief... .By God !\\" Historic background The novel is based upon the lives of a few families of Mah√© enclave. The new generation in Mah√© wanted to merge the French enclave with India. The older people were loyal to the French rulers and believed in a romantic charm of the colonial rule. Two persons called Kanaran and Dasan take leadership of the fight against the French. The novel includes finer details about the romance of French rule in Mah√©. The streets of Mah√© with French names revoke an old charm. There is a christian church and many Hindu temples mentioned in the story. The story describes the first revolution when the activists removed the national flag from one of the government offices. This revolution was certainly a failure as the French navy came and the activists fled across the Mah√© Bridge. The second and final revolution was however successful and the French rulers escaped by ship. Plot summary The protagonist in the novel is a young man called Dasan who was born in French Mah√© and educated in Pondicherry. Even though he was offered a job in the French administration and assistance for higher education in Paris, he instead joins the freedom movement led by Gandhian Kanaran, and is attracted by communist ideology. A girl called Chandrika falls in love with him, but he is not able to promise her a married life because of his commitment to the revolution. A French court sentences Dasan to 12 years of imprisonment, but Dasan escapes captivity by walking across to the Indian Union. Very soon he comes back to Mah√© leading a group of volunteers and frees Mah√© from foreign rule. The French national flag is removed and the Indian national flag is hoisted on government buildings. Despite being a local hero, he struggles for his livelihood as he refuses to accept regular employment and join the mainstream lifestyle. His girlfriend is forced by her parents to marry another man, so she commits suicide. Dasan also follows her way to reach the abode of the soul on the Velliyamkallu island on the Mah√© coast.

It belongs to the Syro-Malabar Church under the Archeparchy of Changanacherry. It is a Forane church, with several parishes under it. History Champakulam Kalloorkadu St. Mary's Basilica (also called Champakulam Valia Palli) is one of the oldest Christian churches in India and the mother church of almost all Catholic Syrian churches in Alleppey District. Believed to be established in AD 427, the church was rebuilt many times. Champakulam church was once under Niranam Church, which was founded by the Apostle Saint Thomas himself. The many rock inscriptions found around the church tell us about the history of the church. The open air Rock Cross at Champakulam church is one of the most ancient crosses with clear documentation of its antiquity, dating to AD 1151. There are many archaeological artifacts found around the church that tell more about its history. Champakulam Church had very friendly relations with the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Group and had a pivotal role in many ecumenical efforts in the Eighteian grouenth century. Ikkako Kathanar, one of the martyrs (nasranis) of East Syriac Catholics, was born in this parish. Champakulam church has been recognized by the Universal Church as a Basilica. On 27 November 2016, the church was officially declared as a basilica by Pope Francis and Mar Joseph Perumthottam, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Changanacherry. This is the first basilica in the archdiocese of Changanasserry, the fourth in the Syro Malabar Church, the ninth in Kerala and the twenty-third basilica in India. Over the years, the church has undergone significant updates. Initially, there was a small parish hall with about hundred seats. A few years back, a bigger Parish Hall was constructed. The latest, inaugurated on 3 January 2011, has 800+ seats. St. Mary's Theological Center was inaugurated in 2011 as well.

Ikkako Kathanar- the forgotten martyr of Catholic Saint Thomas Christians Ikkako Kathanar was a priest from this parish who became martyr in the hand of Portuguese for protecting the East Syriac tradition of the indigenous catholic church of India (Nasranis) mainly along the malabar coast. Till the arrival of Europeans Nasranis were belonging to the East Syriac rites in the Catholic Church. The Europeans under the Padroado and Propaganda tried to forcefully convert the nasranis into western or Latin rite. Ikkako Kathanar is one of the faithful of the church who tried to resist this illegal attempt which extended over more than five centuries. He attained martyrdom under the hands of propaganda carmelites during this. Annual Feasts Apart from general Christian Holy celebrations like Christmas, Good Friday & Easter (Holy week) etc., there are two main yearly feasts (‡¥Æ‡¥≤‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥≥‡¥Ç: ‡¥™‡µÜ‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥≥‡µç‚Äç).

The general approach in multi-swarm optimization is that each sub-swarm focuses on a specific region while a specific diversification method decides where and when to launch the sub-swarms. The multi-swarm framework is especially fitted for the optimization on multi-modal problems, where multiple (local) optima exist. Description In multi-modal problems it is important to achieve an effective balance between exploration and exploitation. Multi-swarm systems provide a new approach to improve this balance. Instead of trying to achieve a compromise between exploration and exploitation which could weaken both mechanisms of the search process, multi-swarm systems separate them into distinct phases. Each phase is more focused on either exploitation (individual sub-swarms) or exploration (diversification method). The coordination of the sub-swarms depends on the specific diversification method(s) implemented by the multi-swarm system. Wave of Swarm of Particles (WOSP),T.

A distinctive feature of sub-swarms is that their initial positions and initial velocities are not randomly selected as in normal swarms. Instead, they maintain some information from the previous trajectories of the particles. In general, the development of multi-swarm systems leads to design decisions which did not exist during the original development of particle swarm optimization, such as the number of particles to use in each sub-swarm, the optimal value for the constriction factor and the effects of non-random initial positions and initial velocities. These design decisions have been thoroughly studied and have well-established guidelines ‚Äì e.g. the use of non- random initial positions and initial velocities leads to improved results in multi-swarm systems, which is not the case for single-swarms.S.Chen and J.

DSU is not currently widely used in industry. However, researchers have developed a wide variety of systems and techniques for implementing DSU. These systems are commonly tested on real-world programs. Current operating systems and programming languages are typically not designed with DSU in mind. As such, DSU implementations commonly either utilize existing tools, or implement specialty compilers. These compilers preserve the semantics of the original program, but instrument either the source code or object code to produce a dynamically updateable program. Researchers compare DSU-capable variants of programs to the original program to assess safety and performance overhead.  Introduction  Any running program can be thought of a tuple (\\\\delta, P), where \\\\delta is the current program state and P is the current program code. Dynamic software updating systems transform a running program (\\\\delta, P) to a new version (\\\\delta', P'). In order to do this, the state must be transformed into the representation P' expects. This requires a state transformer function. Thus, DSU transforms a program (\\\\delta, P) to (S (\\\\delta), P'). An update is considered valid if and only if the running program (S (\\\\delta), P') can be reduced to a point tuple (\\\\delta, P') that is reachable from the starting point of the new version of the program, (\\\\delta_{init}, P'). The location in a program where a dynamic update occurs is referred to as an update point. Existing DSU implementations vary widely in their treatment of update points. In some systems, such as UpStare and PoLUS, an update can occur at any time during execution. Ginseng's compiler will attempt to infer good locations for update points, but can also use programmer-specified update points. Kitsune and Ekiden require developers to manually specify and name all update points. Updating systems differ in the types of program changes that they support. For example, Ksplice only supports code changes in functions, and does not support changes to state representation. This is because Ksplice primarily targets security changes, rather than general updates. In contrast, Ekiden can update a program to any other program capable of being executed, even one written in a different programming language. Systems designers can extract valuable performance or safety assurances by limiting the scope of updates. For example, any update safety check limits the scope of updates to updates which pass that safety check. The mechanism used to transform code and state influences what kinds of updates a system will support. DSU systems, as tools, can also be evaluated on their ease-of-use and clarity to developers. Many DSU systems, such as Ginseng, require programs to pass various static analyses. While these analyses prove properties of programs that are valuable for DSU, they are by nature sophisticated and difficult to understand. DSU systems that do not use a static analysis might require use of a specialized compiler. Some DSU systems require neither static analysis nor specialty compilers. Programs that are updated by a DSU system are referred to as target programs. Academic publications of DSU systems commonly include several target programs as case studies. vsftpd, OpenSSH, PostgreSQL, Tor, Apache, GNU Zebra, memcached, and Redis are all dynamic updating targets for various systems. Since few programs are written with support for dynamic updating in mind, retrofitting existing programs is a valuable means of evaluating a DSU system for practical use.  Related fields  The problem space addressed by dynamic updating can be thought of as an intersection of several others. Examples include checkpointing, dynamic linking, and persistence. As an example, a database that must be backward-compatible with previous versions of its on-disk file format, must accomplish the same type of state transformation expected of a dynamic updating system. Likewise, a program that has a plugin architecture, must be able to load and execute new code at runtime. Similar techniques are sometimes also employed for the purpose of dynamic dead-code elimination to remove conditionally dead or unreachable code at load or runtime, and recombine the remaining code to minimize its memory footprint or improve speed. FreeKEYB 6.57p1 Beta as of 2004-08-17 with outdated and incomplete documentation --> (NB. The K3PLUS successor FreeKEYB is a fully reconfigurable driver with many dynamically loadable special features. It implements a unique form of byte-level granular dynamic dead code elimination and relocation techniques at load-time as well as self-modifying code and reconfigurability at run-time to minimize its memory footprint close to the canonical form depending on the hardware, operating system, other environment and driver configuration as well as the selected feature set and locale (about sixty configuration switches with hundreds of options for an almost unlimited number of possible combinations). The build process utilizes a macro assembler as well as a framework of automatic pre- and post-processing tools analyzing the temporary binaries to generate dependency and code morphing meta data to be embedded into the resulting executable file alongside the binary code and a self-discarding, relaxing and relocating loader to dynamically (re)combine, (over)load, modify, update or unload the runtime image (code and data) of the driver as requested. The complexity is hidden in a single self-contained file so that for a user the handling is the same as for a normal (semi-)monolithic driver/TSR.  History  The earliest precursor to dynamic software updating is redundant systems. In a redundant environment, spare systems exist ready to take control of active computations in the event of a failure of the main system. These systems contain a main machine and a hot spare. The hot spare would be periodically seeded with a checkpoint of the primary system. In the event of a failure, the hot spare would take over, and the main machine would become the new hot spare. This pattern can be generalized to updating. In the event of an update, the hot spare would activate, the main system would update, and then the updated system would resume control. The earliest true Dynamic Software Updating system is DYMOS (Dynamic Modification System). Presented in 1983 in the PhD dissertation of Insup Lee, DYMOS was a fully integrated system that had access to an interactive user interface, a compiler and runtime for a Modula variant, and source code. This enabled DYMOS to type- check updates against the existing program. Implementation DSU systems must load new code into a running program, and transform existing state into a format that is understood by the new code. Since many motivational use-cases of DSU are time-critical (for example, deploying a security fix on a live and vulnerable system), DSU systems must provide adequate update availability. Some DSU systems also attempt to ensure that updates are safe before applying them. There is no one canonical solution to any of these problems. Typically, a DSU system that performs well in one problem area does so at a trade-off to others. For example, empirical testing of dynamic updates indicates that increasing the number of update points results in an increased number of unsafe updates.  Code transformation  Most DSU systems use subroutines as the unit of code for updates; however, newer DSU systems implement whole- program updates. If the target program is implemented in a virtual machine language, the VM can use existing infrastructure to load new code, since modern virtual machines support runtime loading for other use cases besides DSU (mainly debugging). The HotSpot JVM supports runtime code loading, and DSU systems targeting Java (programming language) can utilize this feature. In native languages such as C or C++, DSU systems can use specialized compilers that insert indirection into the program. At update time, this indirection is updated to point to the newest version. If a DSU system does not use a compiler to insert these indirections statically, it insert them at runtime with binary rewriting. Binary rewriting is the process of writing low-level code into the memory image of a running native program to re-direct functions. While this requires no static analysis of a program, it is highly platform- dependent. Ekiden and Kitsune load new program code via starting an entirely new program, either through fork-exec or dynamic loading. The existing program state is then transferred to the new program space.  State transformation  During an update, program state must be transformed from the original representation to the new version's representation. This is referred to as state transformation. A function which transforms a state object or group of objects is referred to as a transformer function or state transformer. DSU systems can either attempt to synthesize transformer functions, or require that the developer manually supply them. Some systems mix these approaches, inferring some elements of transformers while requiring developer input on others. These transformer functions can either be applied to program state lazily, as each piece of old-version state is accessed, or eagerly, transforming all state at update time. Lazy transformation ensures that the update will complete in constant time, but also incurs steady-state overhead on object access. Eager transformation incurs more expense at the time of update, requiring the system to stop the world while all transformers run. However, eager transformation allows compilers to fully optimize state access, avoiding the steady-state overhead involved with lazy transformation.  Update safety  Most DSU systems attempt to show some safety properties for updates. The most common variant of safety checking is type safety, where an update is considered safe if it does not result in any new code operating on an old state representation, or vice versa. Type safety is typically checked by showing one of two properties, activeness safety or cons-freeness safety. A program is considered activeness-safe if no updated function exists on the call stack at update time. This proves safety because control can never return to old code that would access new representations of data. Cons-Freeness is another way to prove type safety, where a section of code is considered safe if it does not access state of a given type in a way that requires knowledge of the type representation. This code can be said to not access the state concretely, while it may access the state abstractly. It is possible to prove or disprove cons-freeness for all types in any section of code, and the DSU system Ginseng uses this to prove type safety. If a function is proven cons- free, it can be updated even if it is live on the stack, since it will not cause a type error by accessing state using the old representation. Empirical analysis of cons-freeness and activeness safety by Hayden et all show that both techniques permit most correct updates and deny most erroneous updates. However, manually selecting update points results in zero update errors, and still allows frequent update availability. Existing systems  DYMOS  DYMOS is notable in that it was the earliest proposed DSU system. DYMOS consists of a fully integrated environment for programs written in a derivative of Modula, giving the system access to a command interpreter, source code, compiler, and runtime environment, similar to a REPL. In DYMOS, updates are initiated by a user executing a command in the interactive environment. This command includes directives specifying when an update can occur, called when-conditions. The information available to DYMOS enables it to enforce type-safety of updates with respect to the running target program.  Ksplice, kpatch and kGraft  Ksplice is a DSU system that targets only the Linux kernel, making itself one of the specialized DSU systems that support an operating system kernel as the target program. Ksplice uses source- level diffs to determine changes between current and updated versions of the Linux kernel, and then uses binary rewriting to insert the changes into the running kernel. Ksplice was maintained by a commercial venture founded by its original authors, Ksplice Inc., which was acquired by Oracle Corporation in July 2011. Ksplice is used on a commercial basis and exclusively in the Oracle Linux distribution. SUSE developed kGraft as an open-source alternative for live kernel patching, and Red Hat did likewise with kpatch. They both allow function-level changes to be applied to a running Linux kernel, while relying on live patching mechanisms established by ftrace. The primary difference between kGraft and kpatch is the way they ensure runtime consistency of the updated code sections while hot patches are applied. kGraft and kpatch were submitted for inclusion into the Linux kernel mainline in April 2014 and May 2014, respectively, and the minimalistic foundations for live patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on April 12, 2015. Since April 2015, there is ongoing work on porting kpatch and kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline. However, implementation of the function-level consistency mechanisms, required for safe transitions between the original and patched versions of functions, has been delayed because the call stacks provided by the Linux kernel may be unreliable in situations that involve assembly code without proper stack frames; as a result, the porting work remains in progress . In an attempt to improve the reliability of kernel's call stacks, a specialized sanity-check userspace utility has also been developed with the purpose of checking kernel's compile-time object files and ensuring that the call stack is always maintained; it also opens up a possibility for achieving more reliable call stacks as part of the kernel oops messages.  Ginseng  Ginseng is a general-purpose DSU system. It is the only DSU system to use the cons-freeness safety technique, allowing it to update functions that are live on the stack as long as they do not make concrete accesses to updated types. Ginseng is implemented as a source-to-source compiler written using the C Intermediate Language framework in OCaml. This compiler inserts indirection to all function calls and type accesses, enabling Ginseng to lazily transform state at the cost of imposing a constant-time overhead for the entirety of the program execution. Ginseng's compiler proves the cons-freeness properties of the entire initial program and of dynamic patches. Later versions of Ginseng also support a notion of transactional safety. This allows developers to annotate a sequence of function calls as a logical unit, preventing updates from violating program semantics in ways that are not detectable by either activeness safety or cons-freeness safety. For example, in two versions of OpenSSH examined by Ginseng's authors, important user verification code was moved between two functions called in sequence. If the first version of the first function executed, an update occurred, and the new version of the second function was executed, then the verification would never be performed. Marking this section as a transaction ensures that an update will not prevent the verification from occurring.  UpStare  UpStare is a DSU system that uses a unique updating mechanism, stack reconstruction. To update a program with UpStare, a developer specifies a mapping between any possible stack frames. UpStare is able to use this mapping to immediately update the program at any point, with any number of threads, and with any functions live on the stack.  PoLUS  PoLUS is a binary-rewriting DSU system for C. It is able to update unmodified programs at any point in their execution. To update functions, it rewrites the prelude to a target function to redirect to a new function, chaining these redirections over multiple versions. This avoids steady-state overhead in functions that have not been updated.  Katana  Katana is a research system that provides limited dynamic updating (similar to Ksplice and its forks) for user-mode ELF binaries. The Katana patching model operates on the level of ELF objects, and thus has the capacity to be language-agnostic as long as the compilation target is ELF.  Kitsune and Ekiden  Ekiden and Kitsune are two variants of a single DSU system that implements the state-transfer style of DSU for programs written in C. Rather than updating functions within a single program, Ekiden and Kitsune perform updates over whole programs, transferring necessary state between the two executions. While Ekiden accomplishes this by starting a new program using the UNIX idiom of fork-exec, serializing the target program's state, and transferring it, Kitsune uses dynamic linking to perform \\"in-place\\" state transfer. Kitsune is derived from Ekiden's codebase, and can be considered a later version of Ekiden. Ekiden and Kitsune are also notable in that they are implemented primarily as application-level libraries, rather than specialized runtimes or compilers. As such, to use Ekiden or Kitsune, an application developer must manually mark state that is to be transferred, and manually select points in the program where an update can occur. To ease this process, Kitsune includes a specialized compiler that implements a domain-specific language for writing state transformers.  Erlang  Erlang supports Dynamic Software Updating, though this is commonly referred to as \\"hot code loading\\". Erlang requires no safety guarantees on updates, but Erlang culture suggests that developers write in a defensive style that will gracefully handle type errors generated by updating.  Pymoult  Pymoult is a prototyping platform for dynamic update written in Python. It gathers many techniques from other systems, allowing their combination and configuration. The objective of this platform is to let developers chose the update techniques they find more appropriate for their needs. For example, one can combine lazy update of the state as in Ginseng while changing the whole code of the application as in Kitsune or Ekiden.  Microsoft Visual C++  Microsoft is utilizing internal patching technology for Microsoft Visual C++ that supports patching individual C++ functions while maintaining functional correctness of patches. Currently known applications is SQL Server in Azure SQL Database.

Harrild was the founder of the business Harrild & Sons, his history is recorded in 'The House of Harrild' by Edward Liveing written in 1949, which gives the complete history of the Company, and also many names and dates of Harrilds. Early life Robert Harrild, born in Bermondsey, London, England, was the second son of Robert Harrild of Surrey and his wife Sarah Johnson. In 1801, at the age of 21, Harrild set up in partnership with Edward Billing at the Bluecoat-Boy Printing Office, Russell Street, Bermondsey. In the same year, Harrild married Edward Billing's sister, Elizabeth. Joseph Billing, nephew of Edward, later married Sarah Harrild, daughter of Robert. Seven of Robert and Elizabeth's ten children survived into adulthood, their daughter Mary married the colour-printing innovator George Baxter (printer), Baxter's sister Mary married Robert's eldest son and heir Robert Harrild. Printing career Albion press manufactured by Harrild & Sons In 1807, Harrild branched off on his own to premises at 127 Bermondsey Street. During this period he published and printed a number of books, some copies of which are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. In 1809, Harrild started up in business making printers' materials and working as a printers engineer. When he began, the blocks of type used in printing were inked by means of ink balls, a method introduced by Caxton. Harrild is noted for having improved the process by introducing ‚Äòcomposition rollers‚Äô which sped up printing and became an indispensable innovation. At first this change was met with opposition from the workforce, and Harrild had to bring all his tact and energy to the situation to persuade people that it was in their interests to work with the new rollers. Harrild continued to make both balls and rollers for inking after 1810, but his new rollers vastly increased the production of newspapers, whereas the old ball method of inking limited printing to between 150 and 200 copies per hour. Harrild introduced the rollers for inking at his London factories in Farringdon Road; as printers and compositors from all over England visited to see the invention, his new method quickly became known and adopted throughout the industry. Harrild himself came to be considered one of the heads of the printing trade, and gained esteem in part due to his energetic character and philanthropic work. Around 1819, Harrild moved the business to 20 Great Eastcheap, London. He specialized at this time in printing books for children. During the years 1818-1825, the business branched into considerable amounts of commercial printing and Harrild was instrumental in manufacturing rollers for printing machines and for installing and maintaining these rollers in many of the Fleet Street newspaper offices. In 1824, Harrild moved the business again, this time to 25 Friday Street and 3 years later took over 10 and 11 Distaff Lane. By 1832 the printing side of the business had been discontinued and he concentrated on the engineering side, manufacturing his own printing presses and supplying rollers and materials. Later life Harrild was responsible for preserving the Benjamin Franklin printing press. Franklin‚Äôs machine was one that he worked on as an unknown journeyman, whilst living in London in 1752-6; although it became obsolete when first the Blaew Press and later the Stanhope were invented, Harrild kept the machine on which Franklin had worked until 1841. Harrild exhibited the machine in public, sending the money raised by the exhibition to the London Printers' Pension Society. Harrild then presented the Franklin Press to Mr J. B. Murray, from America, and it was taken to the United States and put on show in the patent office at Washington, D.C.. When Harrild died his will made a bequest of ¬£1000 to the 'Printers' Society' which was to be used to create a 'Franklin Pension'. Harrild made his home at Sydenham and for many years he was a parish guardian, having been one of the first to be appointed after the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. When he arrived Sydenham was little more than a wild common, by the time of his death it had become a popular residential neighbourhood, in part due to his own interest in the area. Harrild had been instrumental in developing much of the new housing on Sydenham Common and he had built 'Round Hill' as the family home. His sons Horton and Thomas also had houses built there. His son Henry does not appear to have played a part in the family business, or to have lived at Sydenham, but in Islington. Harrild‚Äôs will excluded all but a minor provision for Henry. His son Thomas became uncle, by marriage, to the author Richard Jefferies.

(EUD) is the German section of the Union of European Federalists (UEF). It is a non-partisan, interdenominational and independent non-governmental organization advocating federal Europe. EUD's youth organization, Junge Europ√§ische F√∂deralisten Deutschland is part of the Young European Federalists.  Self-conception  Europa-Union Deutschland is a citizens' initiative based on volunteerism and active citizenship. EUD is operating on local, regional and national level and unites representatives of all social groups. EUD advocates a far-reaching European Integration. As a mediator between citizens and institutions of the European polity it has been fighting for \\"a citizens' Europe\\" based on social consensus.http://www.europa- union.de/ueber-uns/satzung/ According to EUD's statute: \\"It is the purpose of the association to promote an international attitude, tolerance in all areas of culture and international understanding with the aim of creating the United States of Europe on a federal and democratic-constitutional basis. To fulfill this purpose, EUD organizes meetings and conferences as well as actions at the federal level and regional level, informs its members and the public about the development of the European Union and impacts on policy-makers in a variety of ways.\\" EUD's founding idea was the establishment of democratic and federal structures to enable the cooperation of the European peoples. Important stages of European integration were demanded by Europa-Union Deutschland at an early stage: direct election of the European Parliament, democratization of the European Community/Union, enlargement, introduction of the euro. EUD regularly takes a stand on specific policy areas, particularly concerning a citizens' Europe. In line with the demand for a United States of Europe EUD fought for a European constitution and supported reform processes such as the failed Constitutional Treaty and the successful Treaty of Lisbon. The federalist attitude was confirmed by the organization in December 2009 with the criticism of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. Europa-Union Deutschland organizes lectures in schools and associations as well as conferences, weekend seminars and study tours to European institutions in order to make European Integration more known amongst citizens.  History   Founding Years 1946-1949  In September 1946, the Swiss \\"Europa-Union\\" invited the European Federalists for a conference to Hertenstein close to Lake Lucerne.more information on the role of Europa-Union Switzerland see http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/3542/europatraeume_unterm_schweizer_kreuz.html Twelve theses were formulated constituting the foundation of the European federalists' work in the post-war years. The theses became known as Hertenstein Program and later became the founding document of Europa-Union Deutschland. At the same time in Zurich, Winston Churchill held a plea for a united Europe. The Hertenstein conference was followed by two more in Luxembourg and Basel. In December 1946 the Union of European Federalists (UEF) was founded in Paris, with Italians, French and Dutch being particularly well represented. According to a euro-skeptic British source, until the 1960s, the UEF was financed in part by the American Committee for a United Europe (ACUE), which was directed by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the former U.S. Secret Service .Euro-federalists financed by US spy chiefs Daily Telegraph, 19. November 2000 Invitations to UEF events were also sent to Germans, but they could not participate because they were not allowed to travel by the authorities of the occupied zones in the period after the Second World War. The only exception were Germans living in exile in Switzerland, such as Heinrich Ritzel, a former SPD deputy in the Reichstag. Ritzel was Secretary General of the Swiss Europa-Union in 1939. In several places in the Western occupation zones - especially in the British zone - groups were formed during this period, all of which had the unification of Europe as their goal, but initially had little contact with each other. With the help of Dutch and British participants of the Hertenstein meeting, Heinrich Ritzel managed to get in touch with Wilhelm Heile, district administrator of the town Syke close to Bremen. Already during the times of the Weimar Republic Heile had founded an \\"association for European cooperation\\". Together with the manufacturer Wilhelm Hermes from M√∂nchengladbach Heile initiated on 9 December 1946 a merger of Germany's most important European groups. In line with the Swiss Europa-Union, Ritze suggested the name Europa-Union also for the German \\"Europeans\\". Heile became the first chairman and Hermes became CEO of the new Europa-Union Deutschland. A secretariat was established in M√∂nchengladbach. EUD's first rallies were organized in Duisburg, Cologne, Kiel and L√ºbeck. In the Soviet occupation zone all activities of Europa-Union and other West- oriented pro-European organizations were banned. The first EUD Congress took place in Eutin in 1947. It was attended by 200 delegates from 50 regional groups. In November 1947, after the accession of further new federal groups, Europa-Union became the German section of the UEF.for information on the founding years see: http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=41121101&aref;=image035/E0529/cqsp194707005-P2P-005.pdf&thumb;=false Chaired by Winston Churchill, a \\"Europe-Congress\\" was convoked in The Hague on 7 May 1948. It was attended by more than 700 politicians from the beneficiary countries of the Marshall Plan. The congress had been prepared by the UEF and financed by the ACUE. The most important results were the formation of the Council of Europe and the establishment of the European Movement. In 1949, the \\"German Council of the European Movement\\", which is now the European Movement Germany, was founded in Wiesbaden. Europa-Union Deutschland is member of the European Movement Germany.  1949‚Äì1954  Following the EUD Congress in Eutin another congress took place in Hamburg in May 1949. The publicist Eugen Kogon was elected first president during the Hamburg congress. Carlo Schmid was in absence elected vice-president and henceforth was an important advisor for Europa-Union Deutschland. Under the leadership of Kogon EUD represented the ideological interests and opinions of German left-wing Catholicism and French integral federalism in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The unification of Europe should be achieved bypassing parliaments. In the following years, criticism arose concerning Kogon's leadership style and the political orientation of Europa-Union. In addition, his financial mismanagement, which brought the association to the brink of ruin in the early 1950s, provided the grounds for his dismissal. CDU MP Paul Leverkuehn was elected new president in a crucial vote against Franz Josef Strauss during the EUD Congress in Cologne on 2 May 1954. However, after a serious car accident and hostilities because of his intelligence work during World War II he had to resign in September 1954.  1954‚Äì1978  In the presidential elections at the congress in Hanover in October 1954, Ernst Friedl√§nder emerged as victor after the opposition candidate Kurt Georg Kiesinger had withdrawn his candidacy. After the failure of the European Defence Community in 1954 and the massive decline in membership, the goal of becoming a mass organization was dropped. Instead, the association focused on the systematic manipulation of government bureaucracy and political parties. EUD supported and encouraged Germany's integration with the West. Friedl√§nder was assisted by the Cologne-based banker Friedrich Carl von Oppenheim, who could ensure, through his contacts in the financial world, the economic survival of Europa-Union Deutschland. When Friedl√§nder resigned for health reasons, Oppenheim was elected president in Bremen in mid-January 1958. During this time, the secretariat was moved from Frankfurt to Bonn in order to develop closer ties to federal political actors and to increase influence on German foreign and European policies. Good relations existed with Chancellor Adenauer and in particular with the Foreign Office, which supported Europa-Union Deutschland financially. The positions of the organization during Friedl√§nder's and Oppenheim's presidency were diametrically opposed to Kogon's views. First, a clear choice was made to support an Atlantic- and West-oriented Europe. Second, special emphasis was put on economic issues. Third, Europa-Union clearly committed itself to the free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic.  1979‚Äì1999   1999 until today   Presidents since 1949  * 1949‚Äì1954: Eugen Kogon * 1954: Paul Leverkuehn * 1954‚Äì1957: Ernst Friedl√§nder * 1957‚Äì1973: Friedrich Carl von Oppenheim * 1973‚Äì1980: Theo M.

Working Groups: Future of Europe, Europe-Professionel  In addition to the traditional grass-roots work in regional and local associations and the parliamentary work, EUD increasingly focuses on reaching new target groups as well as developing substantive concepts. EUD has two working groups: One on the \\"future of Europe\\" and one called \\"Europe- Professionel\\". Europe-Professionel is a network of EUD members who deal with European topics in their professional lives. The group was founded in summer 2009. On behalf of EUD's executive board it promotes the Europeanization of German politics. Like EUD's Brussels section (see below), Europe-Professionel comprises lobbyists, civil servants and scientists. Just like parties, the group tries to promote their goals using personal contacts. Spokespersons of the group are the retired Secretary of State and insurance lobbyist Joachim Wuermeling and the civil servant Silke Kaul.See Politik und Kommunikation 18.

The regional association of Saxony is under construction. Europa-Union Deutschland also has a Brussels- based section for Germans working in Brussels temporarily. Michael Koehler, who was the Chief of Cabinet of EU Commissioner Joseph Borg, is chairman of the group. Since 2010, Kohler is Chef de Cabinet of the German EU Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger, who is also a member of EUD. The board consists of European Commission officials, members of the European Parliament, the Information Office of the German states, lobbyists and think tanks. The group organizes events and engages in networking. The group is not very strong in presenting a political position although pro-European networking in the sense of soft lobbying within the German community in Brussels is desired.See EU-Verheugen und ARD-Krause beim verbalen Grillen Veranstaltung der Europa-Union Br√ºssel 26.

The settlement, also known by the Creek name Okfuskenena, was a trading crossroads for natives west of the Chattahoochee River, and reportedly a center for raiding parties against American expansionist efforts in the late 18th century. The village was attacked on September 27, 1793, by a party of white men attempting to rout the Creek population from the state. Several Indians were killed, and the village was burnt to the ground, leading to its characteristic name. From 1966 to 1969, Harold Huscher of the Smithsonian Institution conducted excavations of the area before it was flooded by the West Point Reservoir in 1971. Though the location was lost to history, regional survey and later excavation located a small area that fit within the proper time period of the historic village. According to his data, the village contained a number of curved wooden \\"rotundas\\" or \\"council houses\\", suggesting a series of tribal meeting places within the relatively small town. Later work by Mark Williams of the University of Georgia suggests that Huscher's original theories were incorrect, as the actual recovered data was not consistent enough to suggest overall settlement patterning. Even with improper analysis by the original investigators, in modern reckoning Okfuskenena is considered the most completely and thoroughly excavated historic Creek town in the state of Georgia. Today, the site is unreachable at the bottom of West Point Lake. However, continuing research by the University of Georgia researchers, including ceramic analysis and building distribution continues to provide a wealth of information about historic Creek society.

Its length measures 5.1 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only a portion of the last volution projects. The eight whorls of the teleoconch are very slightly rounded, moderately contracted at the sutures, slightly excurved at the shouldered summit. They are marked by strong, vertical axial ribs, of which 16 occur upon the second and third, 18 upon the fourth, 20 upon the fifth and sixth, and 26 upon the penultimate turn. The intercostal spaces are about twice as wide as the ribs, crossed by five slender spiral cords between the sutures, which render the ribs feebly nodulous at their junction.

Life  Still a minor when he succeeded to the throne, he initially had to accept the tutelage of his cousin Frederick I, ruling Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, until he was declared to have reached majority by King Wenceslaus in 1398. His father had left him a financially and ruined politically country. Unlike his warlike father, Otto remained a peace- loving ruler. He managed to restore political order, but was not able to resolve the financial problems. For the maintenance of law and order, he allied with the cities in the region, such as Uslar, Seesen and Gandersheim, to fight against powerful robber barons. He succeeded in 1407, together with the citizens of G√∂ttingen 1407, to storm the castle at J√ºhnde, and he also forced the Lords of Adelebsen, Hardenberg and Schwicheldt to respect the public peace. Due to permanent financial constraints, he had to borrow money repeatedly from his Wolfenb√ºttel cousins and in exchange promised them the succession in G√∂ttingen already in 1395. When Duke Frederick I of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel died in 1400, Otto had to sign an inheritance treaty with his surviving brothers Bernard I and Henry the Mild. Nevertheless, Otto's financial situation became untenable. As early as 1435, he withdrew from the business of government and gave the cities and Estates a free rein. Otto's agreement met with reservations by the Welf princes of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, William the Victorious and his brother Henry the Peaceful. They had shared the rule but decided to divide their principality in 1432, due to the increasing number of disputes between the two of them. They also had divided the castles Otto had given them as collateral for his many loans. When a dispute arose between Henry and William about the sovereignty in G√∂ttingen, Otto returned from retirement and sided with Henry against William. In 1441, he occupied the castle at M√ºnden. After lengthy negotiations and pressure exerted by King Albert II of Germany, the dispute was finally settled in 1442: Otto retained the city and castle of Uslar, his wife received M√ºnden, Dransfeld and Sichelstein. Seesen and Gandersheim were separated from the Brunswick- G√∂ttingen principality and attached to Henry's part of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. William, in turn, received the concession from Henry and the Dukes of L√ºneburg that he could rule Brunswick-G√∂ttingen until Otto's death. Duke Otto II retired to Uslar, where he lived a life of seclusion for more than 20 years until his death in 1463.  Marriage and issue  Probably around 1408, Otto married Agnes (d. 16 January 1471), a daughter of Landgrave Hermann II of Hesse. He had been engaged to her sister Elizabeth, but she died before the wedding. Otto and Agnes had two daughters: Elizabeth, who died young, and Margaret, who married Duke Henry of Schleswig in 1425. Since Otto II left no male heir, the Brunswick-G√∂ttingen line of the House of Welf died out when he died in 1463. The G√∂ttingen principality passed to William the Victorious and, with effect from 1495, merged into the Principality of Calenberg which was sometimes called Brunswick-Calenberg-G√∂ttingen afterwards.

A military coup is the violent or non-violent overthrow of an existing political regime by the military. Between 1966 and 1999 the army held power in Nigeria without interruption apart from a short-lived return to democracy between 1979 to 1983. The January 1966 coup  The January 1966 coup was carried out by mostly Igbo army officers including Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna among others. The casualties of the coup included the Prime Minister Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the Sardauna of Sokoto Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Premier of the Western Region Samuel Akintola, the finance minister Festus Okotie-Eboh among others. The July 1966 coup Popularly known as the Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966, in July, saw Major-General Gowon succeed Ironsi. It lasted from July 28 to July 30th 1966. The 1975 coup General Yakubu Gowon was ousted in a palace coup on July 30, 1975, which brought then Brigadier Murtala Muhammed to power as Head of State. The 1976 coup Popularly and erroneously known as the 'Dimka Coup', this bloody and aborted coup led to the assassination of General Murtala Muhammed. Upon General Muhammed's death and the foiling of the coup, then Lt General Olusegun Obasanjo became Head of State. The 1983 coup The Nigerian Military Coup of December 31, 1983 was led by a group of senior army officers who overthrew the democratically elected government of President Shehu Shagari. Participants included Majors General Ibrahim Babangida and Muhammadu Buhari, Brigadiers Ibrahim Bako, Sani Abacha, and Tunde Idiagbon. Major General Buhari was appointed Head of State by the conspirators. Details Ibrahim Bako (then Director of the Army Faculty at the Armed Forces Command and staff College, Jaji) and acting GOC 1 Mechanised Division, Kaduna was tasked by the coup conspirators (see below for list of conspirators) with arresting President Shehu Shagari presumably after Shagari's Brigade was killed.by Col Tunde Ogbeha. Author Max Siollun notes that Bako was chosen for the arresting role because Bako's father was a personal friend to Shagari. Unknown to Bako was the fact that the coup plot had leaked to President Shagari whose guards were on high alert. After arriving at the Presidential residence (in non military attire) with an armed detachment to arrest the President, Bako was shot dead, while sitting in the passenger side of a UNIMOG utility truck, in an ensuing fire fight between troops from Bako's detachment and the Brigade of Guards soldiers under the command of Captain Augustine Anyogo.Max Siollun, Oil, Politics and Violence: Nigeria‚Äôs Military Coup Culture (1966-1976), (New York: Algora Publishing, 2009), p. 16-17.

The August 1985 coup This was a palace coup led by then Chief of Army Staff, Major General Ibrahim Babangida who overthrew the administration of Major General Muhammadu Buhari. The alleged Vatsa coup of December 1985 Hundreds of military officers were arrested, some were tried, convicted and eventually executed for conspiring to overthrow the Babangida administration. The conspirators were alleged to have been led by Major General Mamman Jiya Vatsa. The 1990 coup Major Gideon Orkar staged a violent and failed attempt to overthrow the government of General Ibrahim Babangida. The 1993 coup Facing pressure to shift towards a democratic government, Babangida resigned and appointed Chief Ernest Shonekan as interim president on 26 August 1993. Shonekan's transitional administration only lasted three months, as a palace coup led by General Sani Abacha overthrew the Interim government. In September 1994, Abacha issued a decree that placed his government above the jurisdiction of the courts, effectively giving him absolute powerhttps://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/world/nigerian-military- ruler-assumes-absolute-power.html Current status Nigeria today is seemingly democratic with there having been no military coups since 1999, however the decades under military rule have had a resounding impact on the nation with all today‚Äôs 36 states created by the military and there still being a considerable military influence evident.Siollun, p. 16. Patterns According to notable Nigerian historian Max Siollun, ‚ÄúMilitary coups and military rule (which began as an emergency aberration) became a seemingly permanent feature of Nigerian politics.\\"Siollun, p. 11 There was a recurring pattern of coups and counter-coups, that were a succession of increasingly authoritarian and corrupt governments all full of false promises of democracy and new starts. ‚ÄòDecalo lists the following reasons for African military coups: ethnic rivalries, intramilitary quarrels, personal jealousies and ambitions and personal fear‚Äô.Chuka Onwumechili, African Democratization and military coups (Westport: Praeger, 1998), p.40. Role of regional rivalries The regional rivalries which have played such a large part in recurrence of coups were a result of colonialism creating an artificial state encompassing several different distinct ethnic groups. These distinct ethnic groups were represented by regional parties, which ensured that ‚Äúnone of the parties could govern Nigeria on its own, and‚Ä¶ that conflict was only a matter of time away.‚Äù Siollun, p. 12. Therefore, there was no centralised opposition to military rule; when a coup occurred, it was therefore just another faction of military rule. Ogoni Bill of Rights However, one exception to this recurring pattern of factions was the Ogoni people (Mosop), who managed to articulate their grievances into the Ogoni ‚ÄòBill of Rights‚Äô in October 1990. They worked closely with the campaign for democracy as well as attracting the attention of the UN and the support of international NGOs to protest against the Abacha regime. Despite these unified efforts, the military reacted with forceful violence, terrorising villages and holding a corrupt trial with no right of appeal; this resulted in the hanging of 9 activists in 1994.Julius O. Ihonvbere, ‚ÄòAre Thing‚Äôs Falling Apart? The Military and the Crisis of Democratisation in Nigeria‚Äô in The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 34, No. 2, (1996) p. 214. This demonstrates that even when unified support did challenge military rule, the military had the totalitarian power to suppress this opposition. Effects of military rule The economic effects of military rule were disastrous. The traditional agricultural based economy was abandoned and they became extremely dependent on exports of oil which due to frequent fluctuations in oil prices led to an unstable economy.Siollun, p. 2. The Babangida regime of was characterised by ‚Äúgross incompetence and unbridled, waste and mismanagement, the privatisation of public office and public resources, the neglect of non-oil sectors and misplaced priorities‚Äù.Ihonvbere, p.196. Essentially the focus was on the private sector as opposed to the good of the nation. As a result of the military economic policy of the 1980s, 45% of foreign-exchange earnings were going into debt servicing and there was very little growth. This led to a rise in poverty, crime, child abuse, disease, institutional decay and urban dislocation. The instability and dissatisfaction caused by these policies was one of the causes of the consistent pattern of coups.

Elizabeth font Born in 1903 to cultured and affluent parents, she eventually studied typography and calligraphy under E.R. Weiss at the Berlin Academy. Her magazine work for Die Dame, published by Ullstein, where she designed headings and lay-outs, attracted the attention of Georg Hartmann of the Bauer Type Foundry in Frankfurt, and he invited her to design a typeface. This was to become their Elisabeth-Antiqua ‚Äî Elizabeth in English-speaking countries ‚Äî although it was originally to have been Friedlander-Antiqua. Hitler came to power just as the type was ready for casting and Hartmann suggested that the name of the face be changed to Elisabeth, since Friedlander, a recognisably Jewish name, would be inadvisable in the current political conditions. Nazi persecution: forced into exile As a Jew in Germany she suffered from the mounting anti-Semitic laws that were brought in and had to apply for official registration to work, and was refused a permit. In her letter of refusal she was told that, as a 'non-Aryan', she '[lacked] the necessary reliability and fitness to participate in the creation and dissemination of German cultural values.' She moved to Italy in 1936, where she was permitted to work so long as she was not politically active. She learnt the language and worked with the publisher Mondadori, but September 1938 brought harsh Italian Antisemitic Laws, threatening her with loss of rights and employment. Unable, as she had hoped, to go to the United States, where the New York office of the Bauer Foundry were eager to employ her, she obtained a Domestic Service permit for Britain and went to London with her two portfolios of work and an early 18th-century Klotz violin that had belonged to her mother. Bookwork and Penguin Books She learnt English and was eventually rescued from the drudgery of life as a domestic servant by Francis Meynell, who found work for her and became a supportive friend. By 1942 she was in charge of design at the Ministry of Information‚Äôs black propaganda unit, led by Ellic Howe, where she produced forged Wehrmacht and Nazi rubber stamps, false ration books, and so on, while at the same time carrying out freelance commissions. By the end of the war she had a wide circle of friends as well as good contacts in the printing and publishing world. She decided to stay in Britain, became a naturalised citizen and anglicised her name. Later work included the series Britain in Pictures, patterned papers for Curwen and Penguin Books, decorative borders for Linotype, printer's flowers for Monotype, and calligraphy for the Roll of Honour at Sandhurst. She was responsible for many of the post-war designs of Penguin Books and the little Penguin logo when they were 25 years old.

Seven CCGT units were built in Switzerland and Germany by 1978. Historically, CCGTs found most use as external combustion engines \\"with fuels such as bituminous coal, brown coal and blast furnace gas\\" but were superseded by open cycle gas turbines using clean-burning fuels (e.g. \\"gas or light oil\\"), especially in highly efficient combined cycle systems. Air-based CCGT systems have demonstrated very high availability and reliability. The most notable helium-based system thus far was Oberhausen 2, a 50 megawatt cogeneration plant that operated from 1975 to 1987 in Germany. Compared to Europe where the technology was originally developed, CCGT is not well known in the US. Nuclear power Gas- cooled reactors powering helium-based closed-cycle gas turbines were suggested in 1945. The experimental ML-1 nuclear reactor in the early-1960s used a nitrogen-based CCGT operating at 0.9 MPa.

Completing his formal training with an internship at St. Francis Regional Medical Center led to the establishment of his home in Wichita, KS. Riordan had staff positions at St. Francis Regional Medical Center, St. Joseph Medical Center and Wesley Medical Center. He would later co-found, with Olive W. Garvey, the Center for the Improvement of Human Functioning International, Inc. in Wichita, KS. During his time at the Center, he also served as Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Preventative Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center and at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine in San Juan. Over the course of his career, he wrote four books, several papers and many publications on the topic of medicine. He was a recipient of the 2002 Linus Pauling Award from the American College for Advancement in Medicine. Riordan died unexpectedly on January 7, 2005.  Views and controversy  Riordan's High dose vitamin C injections have been met with controversy. Riordan has also been criticized for his work with orthomolecular medicine, a type of alternative medicine.

This act received the assent of the President of India on the 30 October 2001. The PPV&FR; Act, 2001 was enacted to grant intellectual property rights to plant breeders, researchers and farmers who have developed any new or extant plant varieties. The Intellectual Property Right granted under PPV & FR Act, 2001 is a dual right ‚Äì one is for the variety and the other is for the denomination assigned to it by the breeder. The rights granted under this Act are heritable and assignable and only registration of a plant variety confers the right. Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant. Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner. Farmers' varieties are eligible for registration and farmers are totally exempted from payment of any fee in any proceedings under this Act. The period of protection for field crops is 15 years and for trees and vines is 18 years and for notified varieties it is 15 years from the date of notification under section 5 of Seeds Act, 1966. Annual fee has to be paid every year for maintaining the registration and renewal fee has to be paid for the extended period of registration. Farmers can claim for compensation if the registered variety fails to provide expected performance under given conditions. The rights granted under this Act are exclusive right to produce, sell, market, distribute, import and export the variety. Civil and criminal remedies are provided for enforcement of breeders' rights and provisions relating to benefit sharing and compulsory licence in case registered variety is not made available to the public at reasonable price are provided. Compensation is also provided for village or rural communities if any registered variety has been developed using any variety in whose evolution such village or local community has contributed significantly. The procedural details and modes of implementing this Act are provided in PPV&FR; Rules, 2003. In the present article, we are discussing some of the important legal provisions of this Act along with some of the case studies.

He is best known as the founder of the globally renowned Muscleworks Gym in London. Early life Kyriacou was born in Larnaca into a Greek Cypriot family. His father was a truck driver and the owner of the family shop, while his mother was a seamstress. As a child, he frequently visited the cinema with a predilection for films featuring bodybuilder and actor Steve Reeves. From the age of eight, he helped his mother in the shop until the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Aged 15, Kyriacou fled to England and settled in Tottenham, London. Isolated from his family in Cyprus, he started working shortly after his arrival in England and continued his secondary school education. Career At the age of 21, Kyriacou started training as a bodybuilder. In 1992, he was crowned the South East Britain Bodybuilding Champion and was nominated as a finalist in the British Championship in the under 80 kg weight class. From 1996 to 1998, he was barred from the European Federation of Bodybuilders (EFBB) now the United Kingdom Bodybuilding & Fitness Federation (UKBFF) and instead competed for his native Cyprus during this time. He won the Cyprus Grand Prix in 1996 and 1997, but was not allowed to compete internationally for the country since he was no longer a resident. He retired from professional bodybuilding in 1998 to focus on owning his own gyms and coaching bodybuilders. In 1985 Kyriacou opened the Bodyworks Gym in Tottenham. According to Kyriacou, he wanted ‚Äòsomewhere to train that was the best in the country and that would also produce the best‚Äô. In 1988 he opened another gym, the now world-famous Muscleworks, in Bethnal Green, London. The gym covered 8,000 sq ft and had more than 2,000 active members, including professional bodybuilders, hardcore weight trainers, and other fitness enthusiasts. The original Muscleworks premises in Bethnal Green has since been converted into a female-only gym by the name of ‚ÄòBodylines‚Äô (also owned by Kyriacou), since Muscleworks itself has moved to a larger site (also in Bethnal Green) in Vallance Road. Kyriacou opened Island Fitness in Enfield, London in 2001, and Muscleworks 2 in Stoke Newington, London in 2006. Among its current staff, Muscleworks Gym includes a number of fitness gurus and bodybuilding champions. The gym has gained international renown in the bodybuilding industry over the years, and has attracted a number of notable industry names to its member list who have trained under Kyriacou, including Mark Smith, Jamo Nezzar, and eight-time Mr. Olympia winner Ronnie Coleman. Muscleworks Gym was named ‚ÄôGym of the Month‚Äô in October 2008 by Bodybuilding.com, and has also received the UKBFF's title of ‚ÄôMost Successful Gym in British History‚Äò. In 2010, over half of the UKBFF men's champions reportedly trained at Muscleworks Gym.

Background  In 1981 the Music Department at Fullerton College built a 16 track in house recording facility which was to serve as a teaching tool for both student music groups and students wanting to take recording technology classes at a vocational level. Primarily Jazz is the third of many albums to come out of this studio to feature the award-winning Fullerton College Jazz Band. The LP does contain tracks from three of the Fullerton College jazz groups: Jazz Band I, Jazz Band II, Connection Jazz Combo. The distinctive qualities about the LP that set it apart from numerous college jazz records (what people think of as promotional demos) is the fact it was a two-year community college able to get on a label so quickly. Albert Marx, who was the owner of Discovery Records/Trend Records AM-PM label, became very impressed with the band and the level of the music coming from the jazz groups at Fullerton College. He decided to support the younger, up and coming jazz students/players from the greater Los Angeles/Southern California region by producing certain LPs. The roster on this album is self-evident as to the diversity and level of student musicians Fullerton College developed at that time and has for many years.

Radio Free Europe has reported Uzbek human rights activists as stating that the forced labour of children is \\"deliberate state policy\\". A number of Western retail groups including Asda, Gap, Marks & Spencer and Tesco have boycotted the practice. Although officially banned, as of 2009, the practice has been reported to still be continuing. Following widespread global coverage about these practices and in committing to end this practice, the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan declared its intent to ensure that no one under the age of 18 would participate in the cotton harvest, as highlighted in a report by the US Department of Labor. The same report also highlights that the Uzbek government also led a monitoring effort utilizing ILO methodology to observe the fall 2014 harvest in all cotton-growing regions of the country, finding 41 child labourers, assessing penalties to 19 school officials and farm managers for the use of child labour and removing children from the fields.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Tunstall, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with those of St Oswald, Warton, and St John the Evangelist, Yealand Conyers. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1894‚Äì96 for William Sharp of Linden Hall in memory of his wife who had died in 1889. It was designed by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. The church was consecrated on 24 June 1896. Architecture St Mary's is constructed in rubble stone with ashlar dressings, and has tiled roofs. Its plan is simple and consists of a nave with a north porch, and a chancel with a south vestry. On the west gable is a small bellcote. Its architectural style is Gothic Revival. At the corners of the church are diagonal stepped buttresses rising to crocketed finials. On the north side of the nave are two three-light windows, with a two-light window in the north wall of the chancel. The east window has three lights. On the south side of the nave are three three-light windows. All these windows contain simple Perpendicular-style tracery. On each side of the vestry is a flat- headed two-light mullioned window. Inside the church are a Perpendicular-style reredos, an octagonal font, a brass lectern, and a brass chandelier. The two manual organ was installed in 1964, having been moved from a Congregational church in Warrington; it was made by Hall of Kendal. Before installation it had been overhauled by Harrison and Harrison. It was overhauled again in 2005 by David Wells of Liverpool.

This dam, the tallest and slenderest at that time, failed because of an excessive horizontal slip in the gneissic abutment. The tolerable displacement considered in design is not known but, if calculated today, the size effect would reduce it to about one half of the value according to the design procedures in the 1950s. According to the classical theories of elastic or plastic structures made from a material with non-random strength (ft), the nominal strength (œÉN) of a structure is independent of the structure size (D) when geometrically similar structures are considered.The nominal strength of a structure (œÉN) has units of stress and is related to the maximum load (Pmax) that the structure can support. For structures that can be approximated as two-dimensional, œÉN = Pmax/bD where b is the thickness of the two-dimensional structure. For three-dimensional structures, œÉN = Pmax/D2. Any structure dimension can be chosen for D but it must be homologous for every size. Any deviation from this property is called the size effect. For example, conventional strength of materials predicts that a large beam and a tiny beam will fail at the same stress if they are made of the same material. In the real world, because of size effects, a larger beam will fail at a lower stress than a smaller beam. The structural size effect concerns structures made of the same material, with the same microstructure. It must be distinguished from the size effect of material inhomogeneities, particularly the Hall-Petch effect, which describes how the material strength increases with decreasing grain size in polycrystalline metals. The size effect can have two causes: # statistical, due to material strength randomness, likelihood of a critical flaw occurring in a high-stress location, and increasing volume increasing the probability of a serious flaw. # energetic (and non-statistical), due to energy release when a large crack or a large fracture process zone (FPZ) containing damaged material develops before the maximum load is reached. Statistical Theory of Size Effect in Brittle Structures Fig. 1 The statistical size effect occurs for a broad class of brittle structures that follow the weakest-link model. This model means that macro-fracture initiation from one material element, or more precisely one representative volume element (RVE), causes the whole structure to fail, like the failure of one link in a chain (Fig. 1a). Since the material strength is random, the strength of the weakest material element in the structure (Fig. 1a) is likely to decrease with increasing structure size D (as noted already by Mariotte in 1684). Denoting the failure probabilities of structure as P_f and of one RVE under stress \\\\sigma_k as P_1(\\\\sigma_k), and noting that the survival probability of a chain is the joint probability of survival of all its N links, one readily concludes that The key is the left tail of the distribution of P_1(\\\\sigma_k). It was not successfully identified until Weibull in 1939 recognized that the tail is a power law. Denoting the tail exponent as m, one can then show that, if the structure is sufficiently larger than one RVE (i.e., if ), the failure probability of a structure as a function of \\\\sigma_N is Eq. 2 is the cumulative Weibull distribution with scale parameter S_0 and shape parameter m; \\\\Psi = \\\\int_V \\\\left[{\\\\hat\\\\sigma}(\\\\xi) \\\\right]^m \\\\, \\\\mbox{d} V(\\\\xi) = constant factor depending on the structure geometry, V = structure volume; \\\\xi = relative (size-independent) coordinate vectors, \\\\hat\\\\sigma (\\\\xi) = dimensionless stress field (dependent on geometry), scaled so that the maximum stress be 1; n_d = number of spatial dimensions (n_d = 1, 2 or 3); l_0 = material characteristic length representing the effective size of the RVE (typically about 3 inhomogeneity sizes). The RVE is here defined as the smallest material volume whose failure suffices to make the whole structure fail. From experience, the structure is sufficiently larger than one RVE if the equivalent number N_{eq} of RVEs in the structure is larger than about 10^4 ; N_{eq} =( D / l_0 )^{n_d}\\\\Psi = number of RVEs giving the same P_f if the stress field is homogeneous (always N_{eq} < N, and usually N_{eq} \\\\ll N). For most normal-scale applications to metals and fine-grained ceramics, except for micrometer scale devices, the size is large enough for the Weibull theory to apply (but not for coarse- grained materials such as concrete). From Eq. 2 one can show that the mean strength and the coefficient of variation of strength are obtained as follows: (where \\\\Gamma is the gamma function) The first equation shows that the size effect on the mean nominal strength is a power function of size D, regardless of structure geometry. Weibull parameter m can be experimentally identified by two methods: 1) The values of \\\\sigma_N measured on many identical specimens are used to calculate the coefficient of variation of strength, and the value of m then follows by solving Eq. (4); or 2) the values of \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}_N are measured on geometrically similar specimens of several different sizes D and the slope of their linear regression in the plot of \\\\log \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}_N versus \\\\log D gives -1/m. Method 1 must give the same result for different sizes, and method 2 the same as method 1. If not, the size effect is partly or totally non-Weibullian. Omission of testing for different sizes has often led to incorrect conclusions. Another check is that the histogram of the strengths of many identical specimens must be a straight line when plotted in the Weibull scale. A deviation to the right at high strength range means that N_{eq} is too small and the material quasibrittle. Energetic Size Effect The fact that the Weibull size effect is a power law means that it is self-similar, i.e., no characteristic structure size D_0 exists, and l_0 and material inhomogeneities are negligible compared to D. This is the case for fatigue- embrittled metals or fine-grained ceramics except on the micrometer scale. The existence of a finite D_0 is a salient feature of the energetic size effect, discovered in 1984. This kind of size effect represents a transition between two power laws and is observed in brittle heterogenous materials, termed quasibrittle. These materials include concrete, fiber composites, rocks, coarse-grained and toughened ceramics, rigid foams, sea ice, dental ceramics, dentine, bone, biological shells, many bio- and bio-inspired materials, masonry, mortar, stiff cohesive soils, grouted soils, consolidated snow, wood, paper, carton, coal, cemented sands, etc. On the micro- or nano scale, all the brittle materials become quasibrittle, and thus must exhibit the energetic size effect. A pronounced energetic size effect occurs in shear, torsional and punching failures of reinforced concrete, in pullout of anchors from concrete, in compression failure of slender reinforced concrete columns and prestressed concrete beams, in compression and tensile failures of fiber-polymer composites and sandwich structures, and in the failures of all the aforementioned quasibrittle materials. One may distinguish two basic types of this size effect. Type 1: Structures that fail at crack initiation Fig. 2 When the macro-crack initiates from one RVE whose size is not negligible compared to the structure size, the deterministic size effect dominates over the statistical size effect. What causes the size effect is a stress redistribution in the structure (Fig. 2c) due to damage in the initiating RVE, which is typically located at fracture surface. A simple intuitive justification of this size effect may be given by considering the flexural failure of an unnotched simply supported beam under a concentrated load P at midspan (Fig. 2d). Due to material heterogeneity, what decides the maximum load P is not the elastically calculated stress \\\\sigma_1 = M c/I = 3 P L / 2 b D^2 at the tensile face, where M = PL/4 = bending moment, D = beam depth, c=D/2,\\\\;I = bh^3/12 and b = beam width. Rather, what decides is the stress value \\\\bar{\\\\sigma} roughly at distance l_0/2 from the tensile face, which is at the middle of FPZ (2c). Noting that \\\\bar{\\\\sigma} = \\\\sigma_1 - \\\\sigma'_n l_0/2, where \\\\sigma'_n = stress gradient = 2 \\\\sigma_1 / D and \\\\bar{\\\\sigma} = f'_t = intrinsic tensile strength of the material, and considering the failure condition \\\\bar{\\\\sigma} = f'_t, one gets P/bD = \\\\sigma_N = \\\\sigma_0 / (1 - D_b/D) where \\\\sigma_0 = (2D/3L)f'_t, which is a constant because for geometrically similar beams L/D = constant. This expression is valid only for small enough l_0/D, and so (according to the first two terms of the binomial expansion) one may approximate it as which is the law of Type 1 deterministic size effect (Fig. 2a). The purpose of the approximation made is: (a) to prevent \\\\sigma_N from becoming negative for very small D, for which the foregoing argument does not apply; and (b) to satisfy the asymptotic condition that the deterministic size effect must vanish for D/l_0 \\\\to \\\\infty. Here r = positive empirical constant; the values r = 1 = or 2 have been used for concrete, while r \\\\approx 1.45 is optimum according to the existing test data from the literature (Fig. 2d). A fundamental derivation of Eq. 5 for a general structural geometry has been given by applying dimensional analysis and asymptotic matching to the limit case of energy release when the initial macro-crack length tends to zero. For general structures, the following effective size may be substituted in Eq. (5): where \\\\epsilon'_n = strain gradient at the maximum strain point located at the surface, in the direction normal to the surface. Eq. 5 cannot apply for large sizes because it approaches for D \\\\to \\\\infty a horizontal asymptote. For large sizes, \\\\sigma_N must approach the Weibull statistical size effect, Eq. 3. This condition is satisfied by the generalized energetic-statistical size effect law: where r, m are empirical constants (r n_d/m < 1). The deterministic formula (5) is recovered as the limit case for m \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. (Fig. 2d) shows a comparison of the last formula with the test results for many different concretes, plotted as dimensionless strength \\\\sigma_N /f'_t versus dimensionless structure size D/D_0. The probabilistic theory of Type 1 size effect can be derived from fracture nano-mechanics. Kramer's transition rate theory shows that, on the nano-scale, the far-left tail of the probability distribution of nano-scale strength s is a power law of the type s^2. Analysis of the multiscale transition to the material macro-scale then shows that the RVE strength distribution is Gaussian but with a Weibull (or power-law) left tail whose exponent m is much larger than 2 and is grafted roughly at the probability of about 0.001. For structures with N_{eq} < 10^4, which are common for quasibrittle materials, the Weibull theory does not apply. But the underlying weakest-link model, expressed by Eq. (1) for P_f, does, albeit with a finite N, which is a crucial point. The finiteness of the weakest-link chain model causes major deviations from the Weibull distribution. As the structure size, measured by N_{eq}, increases, the grafting point of the Weibullian left part moves to the right until, at about N_{eq} = 10^4, the entire distribution becomes Weibullian. The mean strength can be computed from this distribution and, as it turns out, its plot is identical with the plot of Eq. 5 seen in Fig. 2g. The point of deviation from the Weibull asymptote is determined by the location of the grafting point on the strength distribution of one RVE (Fig. 2g). Note that the finiteness of the chain in the weakest-link model captures the deterministic part of size effect. This theory has also been extended to the size effect on the Evans and Paris' laws of crack growth in quasibrittle materials, and to the size effect on the static and fatigue lifetimes. It appeared that the size effect on the lifetime is much stronger than it is on the short-time strength (tail exponent m is an order-of- magnitude smaller). Type 2: Structures in which a large crack or notch exists Fig. 4 The strongest possible size effect occurs for specimens with similar deep notches (Fig. 4b), or for structures in which a large crack, similar for different sizes, forms stably before the maximum load is reached. Because the location of fracture initiation is predetermined to occur at the crack tip and thus cannot sample the random strengths of different RVEs, the statistical contribution to the mean size effect is negligible. Such behavior is typical of reinforced concrete, damaged fiber-reinforced polymers and some compressed unreinforced structures. The energetic size effect may be intuitively explained by considering the panel in Fig. 1c,d, initially under a uniform stress equal to \\\\sigma_N . Introduction of a crack of length a, with a damage zone of width h at the tip, relieves the stress, and thus also the strain energy, from the shaded undamaged triangles of slope k on the flanks of the crack. Then, if k and a/D are approximately the same for different sizes, the energy released from the shaded triangles is proportional to \\\\bar U D^2, while the energy dissipated by the fracture process is proportional to G_f D; here G_f = fracture energy of the material, \\\\bar U = \\\\sigma_N^2/2E = energy density before fracture, and E = Young's elastic modulus. The discrepancy between D and D^2 shows that a balance of energy release and dissipation rate can exist for every size D only if \\\\sigma_N decreases with increasing D. If the energy dissipated within the damage zone of width h is added, one obtains the Ba≈æant (1984) size effect law (Type 2): (Fig. 4c,d) where B, f'_t, D_0 = constants, where f'_t = tensile strength of material, and B accounts for the structure geometry. For more complex geometries such an intuitive derivation is not possible. However, dimensional analysis coupled with asymptotic matching showed that Eq. 8 is applicable in general, and that the dependence of its parameters on the structure geometry has approximately the following form: where c_f \\\\approx half of the FPZ length, \\\\alpha_0 = a/D = relative initial crack length (which is constant for geometrically similar scaling); g(\\\\alpha_0) = k^2(\\\\alpha_0) = dimensionless energy release function of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), which brings about the effect of structure geometry; k(\\\\alpha_0)= K(\\\\alpha_0) b \\\\sqrt D /P, and K = stress intensity factor. Fitting Eq. 8 to \\\\sigma_N data from tests of geometrically similar notched specimens of very different sizes is a good way to identify the G_f and c_f of the material. Size Effect in Cohesive Crack, Crack Band and Nonlocal Models Numerical simulations of failure by finite element codes can capture the energetic (or deterministic) size effect only if the material law relating the stress to deformation possesses a characteristic length. This was not the case for the classical finite element codes with a material characterized solely by stress-strain relations. One simple enough computational method is the cohesive (or fictitious) crack model, in which it is assumed that the stress \\\\sigma transmitted across a partially opened crack is a decreasing function of the crack opening w, i.e., \\\\sigma = f(w). The area under this function is G_f, and is the material characteristic length giving rise to the deterministic size effect. An even simpler method is the crack- band model, in which the cohesive crack is replaced in simulations by a crack band of width h equal to one finite element size and a stress-strain relation that is softening in the cross-band direction as \\\\sigma = \\\\hat f (\\\\epsilon) where \\\\epsilon = w/h = average strain in that direction. When h needs to be adjusted, the softening stress strain relation is adjusted so as to maintain the correct energy dissipation G_f. A more versatile method is the nonlocal damage model in which the stress at a continuum point is a function not of the strain at that point but of the average of the strain field within a certain neighborhood of size h centered at that point. Still another method is the gradient damage model in which the stress depends not only on the strain at that point but also on the gradient of strain. All these computational methods can ensure objectivity and proper convergence with respect to the refinement of the finite element mesh. Fractal Aspects of Size Effect The fractal properties of material, including the fractal aspect of crack surface roughness and the lacunar fractal aspect of pore structure, may have a role in the size effect in concrete, and may affect the fracture energy of material. However, the fractal properties have yet not been experimentally documented for a broad enough scale and the problem has not yet been studied in depth comparable to the statistical and energetic size effects. The main obstacle to the practical consideration of a fractal influence on the size effect is that, if calibrated for one structure geometry, it is not clear how infer the size effect for another geometry. The pros and cons were discussed, e.g., by Carpinteri et al. (1994, 2001) and Ba≈æant and Yavari (2005). Practical Importance Fig. 5 Schematic explanation of failure of Sleipner A Oil Platform, Norway 1991. The tricell of this $500 million, 190m meters tall, structure imploded under water head of 67 m, causing the platform so sink within 18 minutes (no fatalities). A government commission identified two factors causing failure: poor detailing of reinforcement, and poor finite element mesh. A separate investigation documented a third contributing factor: the size effect in the shear failure shown, which reduced the shear capacity by about 40%. Taking the size effect into account is essential for safe prediction of strength of large concrete bridges, nuclear containments, roof shells, tall buildings, tunnel linings, large load-bearing parts of aircraft, spacecraft and ships made of fiber-polymer composites, wind turbines, large geotechnical excavations, earth and rock slopes, floating sea ice carrying loads, oil platforms under ice forces, etc. Their design depends on the material properties measured on much smaller laboratory specimens. These properties must be extrapolated to sizes greater by one or two orders of magnitude. Even if an expensive full-scale failure test, for example a failure test of the rudder of a very large aircraft, can be carried out, it is financially prohibitive to repeat it thousand times to obtain the statistical distribution of load capacity. Such statistical information, underlying the safety factors, is obtainable only by proper extrapolation of laboratory tests. The size effect is gaining in importance as larger and larger structures, of more and more slender forms, are being built. The safety factors, of course, give large safety margins‚Äîso large that even for the largest civil engineering structures the classical deterministic analysis based on the mean material properties normally yields failure loads smaller than the maximum design loads. For this reasons, the size effect on the strength in brittle failures of concrete structures and structural laminates has long been ignored. Then, however, the failure probability, which is required to be <10^{-6}, and actually does have such values for normal-size structures, may become for very large structures as low as 10^{-3} per lifetime. Such high failure probability is intolerable as it adds significantly to the risks to which people are inevitably exposed. In fact, the historical experience shows that very large structures have been failing at a frequency several orders of magnitude higher than smaller ones. The reason it has not led to public outcry is that the large structures are few. But for the locals, who must use the structures daily, the risk is not acceptable. Another application is the testing of the fracture energy and characteristic material length. For quasibrittle materials, measuring the size effect on the peak loads (and on the specimen softening after the peak load) is the simplest approach. Knowing the size effect is also important in the reverse sense‚Äîfor micrometer scale devices if they are designed partly or fully on the basis of material properties measured more conveniently on the scale of 0.01m to 0.1m.

Military photography At the beginning of World War I Bi≈°ick√Ω was drafted into the Infantry regiment No. 47 in Graz and became a member of the staff and the regimental photographer. The regiment first fought on the Eastern Front, in Galicia; in 1915 it moved to the Italian Front and stayed there until the end of war. Lieutenant (and later Captain) Bi≈°ick√Ω took hundreds of photographs of the life in the trenches, using the ICA Ideal camera. Death One year before the end of the war, while on leave, Bi≈°ick√Ω married Zdenka Pek√°rkov√°. After the war, the family moved to Velvary and Bi≈°ick√Ω worked as building contractor until his death by stomach cancer in 1949. Restoration of photographs Bi≈°ick√Ω's negatives, many on glass, were lent away and lost. During the 1970s they were obtained, unrecognized, by photographer Jaroslav Kuƒçera (1949). In 2002 Kuƒçera started to restore them, and, with the help of historians, identified many locations and events. The author remained unknown. In 2009 the photos were exhibited in the Prague Castle and only then recognized by the photographer's grandson, historian Michal Ryb√°k.

He commanded the American Red Cross Commission to Romania during World War I and was the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia in 1921. He is perhaps best known as one of the founders of the law firm Hunton Williams and as the fianc√© of the writer Ellen Glasgow. Early life Anderson was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. He received an LL.B. in 1898 from Washington and Lee University and returned to Richmond. He was admitted to the bar and in 1899 formed a partnership with Beverley Bland Munford. Two years later Anderson persuaded Munford, Edmund Randolph Williams, and Eppa Hunton to form a new firm, which evolved into Hunton & Williams, one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the South.Thomas B. Gay, The Hunton Williams Firm and Its Predecessors, 1877‚Äì1954 (1971), 36‚Äì46. In 1916, Anderson met and fell in love with the novelist Ellen Glasgow. They began to write a political novel together, for which Anderson supplied copies of his speeches. The character David Blackburn in Glasgow's novel The Builders (1919) strongly resembles Anderson.John T. Kneebone et al., eds., Dictionary of Virginia Biography (1998- ), 1:136-137. World War I After the United States entered World War I, Anderson commanded the American Red Cross Commission to Romania. He remained at his post in Romania until March 1918, when Romania's surrender to Germany forced the Red Cross mission to flee the country. He led a dramatic escape by train across Russia, risking falling into the hands of the equally unfriendly Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. He returned to Richmond but after the Armistice went back to Europe as Red Cross commissioner for the entire Balkans.Anne Hobson Freeman, The Style of a Law Firm: Eight Gentlemen from Virginia (1989), 76‚Äì103. While in the Balkans, Anderson became infatuated with Queen Marie of Romania, and the two began a daily exchange of letters and presents. The rumors surrounding the relationship between Anderson and the queen and his blatant exploitation of their friendship caused his engagement with Glasgow to disintegrate. Glasgow eventually reconciled with Anderson and remained close to him until her death in 1945. She used recognizable details of his life in depicting her faithless heroes in several novels, including Barren Ground (1925), The Romantic Comedians (1926), and Vein of Iron (1935).John T. Kneebone et al., eds., Dictionary of Virginia Biography (1998- ), 1:136-138. Political career In 1920, Anderson received the unanimous endorsement of the Virginia Republican convention for the vice presidency and at the national convention placed fourth in the initial balloting, but Calvin Coolidge received the nomination. Anderson chaired the Republican state convention in 1921 and was nominated for governor of Virginia. He ran on a platform advocating abolition of the poll tax, improvement of highways, reform of the educational system, and greater fiscal responsibility on the part of state government. In the general election, Anderson won about 35 percent of the vote and lost to Elbert Lee Trinkle. Coolidge chose Anderson in 1924 as the agent to settle the Mexican claims resulting from retaliatory raids against Pancho Villa in 1916. Anderson was mentioned for the vice presidency in 1928 and again in 1931. Presidents Warren G. Harding and Herbert Hoover considered nominating him to the United States Supreme Court in 1924 and 1931 respectively, but neither made such a nomination because of the opposition of Virginia Republican leader C. Bascom Slemp and a lack of support from Virginia's Democratic U.S. senators. In 1929 Hoover appointed Anderson to the Wickersham Commission on issues relating to law enforcement, criminal activity, police brutality, and Prohibition.Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volume 1, edited by David Levinson, page 1708 Legal career During the Great Depression, Anderson was a pioneer in corporate reorganization, especially for railroads and transportation companies. He became counsel for the Seaboard Air Line Railway, the Saint Louis-San Francisco Railway, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, and the Baltimore and Ohio. Anderson took a major part in developing what became Chapter XV of the 1939 Bankruptcy Act.Anne Hobson Freeman, The Style of a Law Firm: Eight Gentlemen from Virginia (1989), 76‚Äì103. Anderson was stricken with colon cancer late in the 1940s and was eventually confined to bed. He died on January 7, 1954, and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.

During past ages, there was rain and snow on Mars; especially in the Noachian and early Hesperian epochs.Baker, V. R. (1982), The Channels of Mars, 198 pp., Univ. of Tex. Press, Austin. Some moisture entered the ground and formed aquifers. That is, the water went into the ground, seeped down until it reached a formation that would not allow it to penetrate further (such a layer is called impermeable) . Water then accumulated forming a saturated layer. Deep aquifers may still exist. Overview Researchers have found that Mars had a planet-wide groundwater system and several prominent features on the planet have been produced by the action of groundwater. When water rose to the surface or near the surface, various minerals were deposited and sediments became cemented together. Some of the minerals were sulfates that were probably produced when water dissolved sulfur from underground rocks, and then became oxidized when it came into contact with the air. While traveling through the aquifer, the water passed through igneous rock basalt, which would have contained sulfur. In an aquifer, water occupies open space (pore space) that lies between rock particles. This layer would spread out, eventually coming to be under most of the Martian surface. The top of this layer is called the water table. Calculations show that the water table on Mars was for a time 600 meters below the surface.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7eb4/bb40fe291f5fde8dce48cc9fbe190ca29cde.pdfAndrews- Hanna, J., K.

Planets, 119, 1991‚Äì2016, doi:10.1002/2013JE004588 Layered terrain Layers may be formed by groundwater rising up depositing minerals and cementing sediments. The hardened layers are consequently more protected from erosion. This process may occur instead of layers forming under lakes. Some locations on the Red Planet show groups of layered rocks. Rock layers are present under the resistant caps of pedestal craters, on the floors of many large impact craters, and in the area called Arabia. In some places the layers are arranged into regular patterns.Lewis, K. W., O. Aharonson, J. P. Grotzinger, A. S. McEwen, and R. L. Kirk (2010), Global significance of cyclic sedimentary deposits on Mars, Lunar Planet. Sci., XLI, Abstract 2648. It has been suggested that the layers were put into place by volcanoes, the wind, or by being at the bottom of a lake or sea. Calculations and simulations show that groundwater carrying dissolved minerals would surface in the same locations that have abundant rock layers. According to these ideas, deep canyons and large craters would receive water coming from the ground. Many craters in the Arabia area of Mars contain groups of layers. Some of these layers may have resulted from climate change. The tilt of the rotational axis of Mars has repeatedly changed in the past. Some changes are large. Because of these variations of climate, at times the atmosphere of Mars would have been much thicker and contained more moisture. The amount of atmospheric dust also has increased and decreased. It is believed that these frequent changes helped to deposit material in craters and other low places. The rising of mineral- rich ground water cemented these materials. The model also predicts that after a crater is full of layered rocks, additional layers will be laid down in the area around the crater. So, the model predicts that layers may also have formed in intercrater regions; layers in these regions have been observed. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. On Earth, mineral-rich waters often evaporate forming large deposits of various types of salts and other minerals. Sometimes water flows through Earth's aquifers, and then evaporates at the surface just as is hypothesized for Mars. One location this occurs on Earth is the Great Artesian Basin of Australia. On Earth the hardness of many sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, is largely due to the cement that was put in place as water passed through. In February 2019, European scientists published geological evidence of an ancient planet-wide groundwater system that was, arguably, connected to a putative vast ocean.

In those places, former stream channels are displayed as raised beds, instead of stream valleys. Raised beds form when old stream channels become filled with material that is resistant to erosion. After later erosion removes surrounding soft materials, more resistant materials that were deposited in the stream bed are left behind. Lava is one substance that can flow down valleys and produce such inverted terrain. However, fairly loose materials can get quite hard and erosion resistant when cemented by minerals. These minerals can come from groundwater. It is thought that a low point, like a valley focuses groundflow, so more water and cements move into it, and this results in a greater degree of cementation. Terrain inversion can also happen without cementation by groundwater, however. If a surface is being eroded by wind, the necessary contrast in erodibility can arise simply from variations in grain size of loose sediments. Since wind can carry away sand but not cobbles, for example, a channel bed rich in cobbles could form an inverted ridge if it was originally surrounded by much finer sediments, even if the sediments were not cemented. This effect has been invoked for channels in Saheki Crater.Morgan, A.M.; Howard, A.D.; Hobley, D.E.J.; Moore, J.M.; Dietrich, W.E.; Williams, R.M.E.; Burr, D.M.; Grant, J.A.; Wilson, S.A.; Matsubara, Y.

Evidence for groundwater upwelling Spacecraft sent to Mars provided a wealth of evidence for groundwater being a major cause of many rock layers on the planet. The Opportunity Rover studied some areas with sophisticated instruments. Opportunity‚Äôs observations showed that groundwater repeatedly had risen to the surface. Evidence for water coming to the surface a number of times include hematite concretions (called \\"blue berries\\"), cementation of sediments, alteration of sediments, and clasts or skeletons of formed crystals. Baker, V. R. (1982), The Channels of Mars, 198 pp., Univ. of Tex. Press To produce skeleton crystals, dissolved minerals were deposited as mineral crystals, and then the crystals were dissolved when more water came to the surface at a later time. The shape of the crystals could still be made out. Opportunity found hematite and sulfates in many places as it traveled on the surface of Mars, so it is assumed that the same types of deposits are widespread, just as predicted by the model. Image:Voids on bedrock on Mars.jpgHoles (Vugs) in bedrock in the shape of crystals that were there, but have since been dissolved, as seen by Opportunity Rover. The holes have the shape of the original crystals. \\"Blueberries\\" (hematite spheres) on a rocky outcrop at Eagle Crater. Note the merged triplet in the upper left. Orbiting probes showed that the type of rock around Opportunity was present in a very large area that included Arabia, which is about as large as Europe. A spectroscope, called CRISM, on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found sulfates in many of the same places that the upwelling water model had predicted, including some areas of Arabia.M. Wiseman, J.

Zabrusky DISTRIBUTION OF HYDRATED SULFATES ACROSS ARABIA TERRA USING CRISM DATA: IMPLICATIONS FOR MARTIAN HYDROLOGY. 42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2011) 2133.pdf The model predicted deposits in Valles Marineris canyons; these deposits have been observed and found to contain sulfates. Other locations predicted to have upwelling water, for example chaos regions and canyons associated with large outflows, have also been found to contain sulfates. Layers occur in the types of locations predicted by this model of groundwater evaporating at the surface. They were discovered by the Mars Global Surveyor and HiRISE onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Layers have been observed around the site that Opportunity landed and in nearby Arabia. The ground under the cap of pedestal craters sometimes displays numerous layers. The cap of a pedestal crater protects material under it from eroding away. It is accepted that the material that now is only found under the pedestal crater‚Äôs cap formerly covered the whole region. Hence, layers now just visible under pedestal craters once covered the whole area. Some craters contain mounds of layered material that reach above the crater‚Äôs rim. Gale Crater and Crommelin (Martian crater) are two craters that hold large mounds. Such tall mounds were formed, according to this model, by layers that first filled the crater, and then continued to build up around the surrounding region. Later erosion removed material around the crater, but left a mound in the crater that was higher than its rim. Note that although the model predicts upwelling and evaporation that should have produced layers in other areas (Northern lowlands), these areas do not show layers because the layers were formed long ago in the Early Hesperian Epoch and were therefore subsequently buried by later deposits. Strong evidence for groundwater making lakes in deep craters was described by a group of European scientists in February 2019. https://www.leonarddavid.com/planet%E2%80%90wide-groundwater-system-on-mars- new-geological-evidence/ Craters examined did not show inlets or outlets; therefore, water for the lake would have come from the ground. These craters had floors lying roughly 4000 m below Martian 'sea level'. Features and minerals on the floors of these craters could only have formed in the presence of water. Some of the features were deltas and terraces.http://astrobiology.com/2019/02/first-evidence-of-a-planet-wide- groundwater-system-on-mars.html Some of the craters studied were Oyama, Pettit, Sagan, Tombaugh, Mclaughlin, du Martheray, Nicholson, Curie, and Wahoo. It seems that if a crater was deep enough, water came out of the ground and a lake was formed.

He was a son of Liu Rengong the military governor of the larger Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) and followed his father's orders. After his father was overthrown and put under house arrest by his younger brother Liu Shouguang, he tried to attack Liu Shouguang, but was captured in battle and subsequently killed by his brother.  Background  It is not known when Liu Shouwen was born. His father Liu Rengong was a Lulong Circuit officer who took over the circuit with the military support of the major warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) in 895,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. but then turned against Li in 897 and became an independent warlord.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Liu Shouwen appeared to be the oldest son,History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 135. and it is known that he was older than his brother Liu Shouguang,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. and that he had a sister who married the Lulong officer Dan Keji (). (A sister of Liu Shouwen's was later said to be the mother of the officer Wang Sitong, but it is unclear whether she was a different sister (which appeared likely) or the same sister (who might have married Wang Sitong's father after Dan's death)). The first historical reference to Liu Shouwen's acts was in 898, at which time Liu Rengong was embroiled in a dispute over salt rights with Lu Yanwei, then the military governor of Yichang. Liu Rengong thus sent Liu Shouwen to attack Yichang's capital Cang Prefecture (). Lu, unable to withstand his attack, abandoned the circuit and fled to Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Liu Rengong thus took over the three prefectures of Yichang (Cang, Jing (ÊôØÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou), and De (Âæ∑Â∑û, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) Prefectures) and commissioned Liu Shouwen as the acting military governor. He sent a request to then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong to grant Liu Shouwen banners and rods of a military governor (i.e., to make Liu Shouwen military governor). Emperor Zhaozong initially refused. Liu Rengong, who had then become arrogant and was planning to take over the entire region north of the Yellow River, responded to Emperor Zhaozong's eunuch messenger, \\"I myself have banners and rods. All I want are the authentic colors from [the imperial capital] Chang'an. Why is it that I made so many petitions and still do not receive them? Tell them this!\\" However, Emperor Zhaozong did eventually relent and make Liu Shouwen the military governor of Yichang.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39.  As military governor of Yichang   During Tang  In 899, Liu Rengong launched his plan with 100,000 soldiers from Lulong and Yichang Circuits, heading first toward Bei Prefecture (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), which belonged to Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). He captured Bei Prefecture and slaughtered its people, and then headed toward Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture (). Weibo's military governor Luo Shaowei sought aid from Xuanwu's military governor Zhu Quanzhong, and Zhu sent his generals Li Si'an () and Zhang Cunjing () to aid Luo. Liu Rengong made Liu Shouwen and Dan Keji his forward commanders, stating to Liu Shouwen, \\"You are 10 times as brave as Li Si'an. You should first capture him, and then capture Luo Shaowei.\\" Liu Shouwen and Dan subsequently engaged Li, but were ambushed in a trap set by Li and his subordinate Yuan Xiangxian. 30,000 Lulong soldiers were killed, as was Dan; Liu Shouwen barely escaped. Subsequently, a joint counterattack by Xuanwu and Weibo forces further crushed Liu Rengong's main force, and Liu Rengong and Liu Shouwen fled back to their own territory. In 900, Zhu sent his general Ge Congzhou to attack Liu Rengong. Ge first captured De Prefecture and killed its prefect Fu Gonghe (), and then put Liu Shouwen under siege at Cang Prefecture. Liu Rengong's own efforts to try to aid his son were initially unsuccessful, but persuaded Li Keyong to try to divert the Xuanwu army's attention by attacking Xing (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai) and Ming (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan), and Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) also urged peace between the two sides. Further, Ge's army ran into rainstorms, and Zhu ordered him to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In 906, Luo, who was fearful of the traditional power that the Weibo headquarter guard corps had in the circuit, slaughtered them with Zhu's support. The other troops were shocked by Luo's actions, and some of the soldiers rebelled under the leadership of the officer Shi Renyu (), who took over Gaotang (È´òÂîê, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong) and claimed to be acting military governor. He sought aid from Hedong and Yichang. In response, Liu Shouwen attacked Weibo's Bei and Ji (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) Prefectures. When Zhu sent Xuanwu troops to reinforce Ji's defense, however, Liu Shouwen withdrew. (Meanwhile, the Xuanwu officers Li Zhouyi () and Fu Daozhao () captured Gaotang and killed Shi.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Later in the year, after helping Luo to put out the remaining rebellions in Weibo, Zhu attacked north and put Cang Prefecture under siege. Liu Rengong's attempts to aid Liu Shouwen were unsuccessful, and the city was soon running out of food, causing the people to resort to eating dirt or cannibalizing each other. When Zhu tried to persuade Liu Shouwen to surrender, Liu Shouwen responded respectfully, \\"I, your servant, am a son to the ruler of You Prefecture [(ÂπΩÂ∑û, Lulong's capital)]. The Prince of Liang [(i.e., Zhu)] is trying to get the entire domain to submit to his righteousness. If a son rebels against his father and surrenders, why would you want such a follower?\\" Zhu admired him for his words, and slowed down the siege. Later in the year, after hearing news that Ding Hui the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) had submitted to Li Keyong, Zhu prepared to withdraw from Cang Prefecture. As Zhu had had much food supply shipped to the front, he was ordering that the food supply be burned or sunk into the water. Liu Shouwen wrote Zhu: Because of Liu Shouwen's request, Zhu left some of the food untouched, and after he withdrew, the people of Cang Prefecture were able to survive because of this.  During Later Liang  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. While several warlords (Li Keyong, Li Maozhen, Yang Wo, and Wang Jian) refused to recognize the Later Liang emperor and most other regional governors did so, the historical records did not explicitly state what position Liu Rengong and, by extension, Liu Shouwen, took publicly. However, in late 907, Liu Shouwen's younger brother Liu Shouguang, who had been rebuked by Liu Rengong and expelled out of the household after having an affair with one of Liu Rengong's concubines, carried out a coup, took over Lulong, put Liu Rengong under house arrest, and formally submitted to Later Liang. Upon hearing of the coup, Liu Shouwen launched a campaign against his brother, which stalemated. With the brothers battling, Luo Shaowei, who recognized the Later Liang emperor, wrote a letter to Liu Shouwen urging him to submit to Later Liang as well. Liu Shouwen, fearing an attack from Later Liang, agreed to do so and sent his son Liu Yanyou () to the Later Liang imperial government to serve as a hostage. Emperor Taizu was pleased, and bestowed the honorary chancellor title Zhongshu Ling () on Liu Shouwen. In 908, Liu Shouwen launched another attack on Liu Shouguang. Liu Shouguang sought aid from Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin (Li Keyong's son and successor), and Li Cunxu sent aid. Liu Shouwen was subsequently repelled by Liu Shouguang at Lutai Base (ËòÜÂè∞Ëªç, in modern Cangzhou) and Yutian (ÁéâÁî∞, in modern Tangshan, Hebei), and he withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In summer 909, Liu Shouwen launched another attack, this time after sending gifts to persuade Khitan and Tuyuhun tribes to fight on his side against Liu Shouguang as well. He initially defeated Liu Shouguang at Jisu (ÈõûËòá, in modern Tianjin), but during the initial victory, Liu Shouwen declared to his troops, \\"Do not kill my brother!\\" As he did, Liu Shouguang's general Yuan Xingqin, who recognized Liu Shouwen, charged toward him and captured him, and subsequently, the battle turned into a rout against the Yichang troops. Liu Shouguang put Liu Shouwen under arrest and headed toward Cang Prefecture. Liu Shouwen's assistants L√º Yan () and Sun He () initially supported Liu Shouwen's son Liu Yanzuo as his successor and put up a defense, and the defense held, even after Liu Shouguang took Liu Shouwen to the city to show the troops that Liu Shouwen had been captured. The food supplies ran out, and the army resorted to slaughtering the weaker residents for food. In spring 910, Liu Yanzuo surrendered, and Liu Shouguang had his son Liu Jiwei () take over Yichang. Liu Shouguang soon after had Liu Shouwen assassinated, then blamed the assassination on the killer and executed the killer.

Life For a long time it was believed that the painters Lancelot Volders and Louis Volders were different persons and that the works signed 'L. Volders' and in a single case 'Louis Volders' had to be ascribed to the painter Louis Volders. Research by art historian Leen Kelchtermans published in 2013 has demonstrated that there is a preponderance of evidence for the conclusion that Lancelot Volders and Louis Volders are in fact the same person and that the correct first name was not Louis but Lancelot. In older literature the artist was also mistakenly referred to as Jan Volders as the result of an incorrect reading of his signature. Henri√´tte Amalie van Anhalt-Dessau with her children Volders was born in Brussels, the son of Joris Volders. He was registered on 8 April 1650 at the Brussels Guild of St Luke as a pupil of Pieter van Ghindertaelen, a popular artist at the time. He is also said to have been a pupil of Gaspard de Crayer, a prominent portrait and history painters originally from Antwerp. There is no record of such apprenticeship in the Brussels Guild records.Alex Pinchart, Lancelot Volders\\" in: Courrier de l'Art, 1887, Vol. 7: Chronique Hebdomadaire des Ateliers, des Mus√©es des Expositions des Ventes Publiques, des Concours des Th√©atres, Etc., Etc , 5 May 1883. Pp. 205-206 In 1657 he became a master in the Brussels Guild of St Luke.Le Mayeur de Merpr, Lancelot Volders in Dictionnaire des peintres belges Lancelot was principally active in Brussels between 1657 and 1723. He died and was buried in Brussels. Volders worked from the 1690s on commissions for members of the court of the Stadtholder of Friesland in Leeuwarden. He became court painter to Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau- Dietz. It is possible that during his active period in Brussels he was discovered by Princess Henri√´tte Amalia of Anhalt-Dessau, the wife of Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, the Stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, during her visit to Brussels in 1689. It is not entirely clear whether Volders stayed in Brussels and painted the members of the Stadholder family there (for example Johan Willem Friso in 1707) or traveled to and resided in Leeuwarden for that purpose. In Leeuwarden itself no traces of his residence are found, except for a \\"Volders room\\" mentioned in an inventory of the court of the Stadtholder. Family portrait in the courtyard of a Brussels palace Volders may also have worked in Leuven in 1703 as evidenced by a signed and presumably dated group portrait (formerly in the Town Hall of Leuven, now in M ‚Äì Museum Leuven, Leuven). The work is traditionally believed to represent seven city magistrates of Leuven gathered around a table presenting the bills. However, the date that was observed on the painting in the 19th century is no longer visible putting its dating in doubt. It is also not firmly established that the persons depicted are Leuven‚Äôs city magistrates.Beatrijs Wolters van der Wey, Groepsvertoon Publieke groepsportretten in Brabant 1585-1800: studie vanuit maatschappelijk, typologisch en iconografisch oogpunt en kritische catalogus, doctoral thesis, KU Leuven, 2012, pp. 857-863 The prominent Brussels painter Victor Honor√© Janssens was a pupil of Lancelot Volders for eight years starting from 1676. Volders also trained lesser known figures such as Frans Thierlincx (1663), Johannes de Reyff (1677) and Hendrick de Vos (1677). Work Lancelot Volders was a specialist portrait painter but also created history paintings and genre scenes. The last works of Lancelot Volders are dated by Rudi Ekkart to 1713.Rudolf Ekkart \\"Schilders aan het hof\\". In Groenveld, S.; Huizinga, J.J.; Kuiper, Y.B. Nassau uit de schaduw van Oranje. Franeker: Uitgeverij Van Wijnen, January 2003, pp. 113‚Äì120 Ladies with their servants He created group and individual portraits, mainly of the members of the Stadtholder court in Leeuwarden. He also painted in Leeuwarden portraits of the local aristocracy.Abraham Wassenbergh, De portretkunst in Friesland in de seventiende eeuw, De Tijdstroom, 1967 He worked in a style close to that of Gonzales Coques and Hieronymus Janssens.

Gr.8¬∞, p. 123 In Flanders, the artist also created a number of group portraits. One of the most notable ones is the signed and dated Family portrait in the courtyard of a Brussels palace (1666, Museum of the City of Brussels). This early work of the artist presents a portrait of a family as well as of a home. The composition shows 13 persons in front of a patrician residence in Brussels. In the background the Brussels Town Hall is discernible. The sitters comprise men, women and children and a mix of aristocrats and bourgeois. Five of them are holding stringed instruments (lute, viols and violins). At the centre of the group is a child who is wearing red heels, an indication that he is of royal descent.New Acquisition: Family Portrait in the Courtyard of a Brussels Palace at the Museum of the City of Brussels Volders was also a painter of history paintings and genre scenes. He painted an Entombment of Christ for the Rich Clares convent in Brussels. Reginald Howard Wilenski, Flemish Painters, 1430-1830, Viking Press, 1960, p. 330 A picture entitled Ladies with their servants (Franz Mayer Museum, Mexico) shows two courtesans busy making their toilet with their servants in attendance. The cosmetics, perfumes, jewelry and luxurious costumes of the courtesans contrast with the simple clothes of the servants. A bed shown on the right-hand side of the composition corroborates the interpretation that this is a scene of courtesans and not of bourgeois ladies.Artes de M√©xico, Frente Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, 1989 Portraits by Volders are in the collections of the Royal Collection of the Netherlands, the collections of German and Dutch descendants of the Dutch kings and of the Friesian Stadtholders. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has examples of miniatures made after his portraits. His works are further in the collections of the Fries Museum and Sminia (now Hans von Herwarth).

He was born in the village of Agios Georgios in Messenia, in 1918. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy, but the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940 interrupted his studies: he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and participated in the campaign, being seriously wounded at the Battle of Trebeshina. Following the collapse of the Greek army during the German invasion of Greece and the subsequent occupation, he was active in the Greek Resistance, forming armed guerrilla groups in the Triphylia-Olympia area and being again wounded. He was named a lieutenant upon Liberation in 1944, and participated in the subsequent Greek Civil War as a company commander with the rank of Captain (1946). He was promoted to Major (1951), Lt. Colonel (1956), Colonel (1967, retroactive to 1960), Brigadier (1970). He commanded the 30th Infantry Regiment and the 11th Infantry Division, as well as serving in various staff positions - including two stints in Cyprus, in 1964-66 as head of the Operations Bureau and in 1969-70 as Chief of Staff of the Cypriot National Guard - and teaching in the Supreme War School. In 1973 he was promoted to lieutenant general and sent to command the III Army Corps in Macedonia. During the July 1974 crisis, brought about by the coup against Cypriot president Makarios III sponsored by the then-ruling Greek military regime and the subsequent Turkish invasion, Davos thus found himself in command of the most powerful formation in the Hellenic Army. It was partly the threat of his active intervention that forced the Armed Forces leadership to topple junta strongman Dimitrios Ioannidis and surrender power to a civilian government under Konstantinos Karamanlis. Shortly after, on 19 August 1974, Davos was appointed as Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff, from which position he helped ensure the loyalty of the army to the new regime, which was still under threat by hardline officers. He continued in this post until 13 September 1976, when he was promoted to full General and placed as Chief of the Armed Forces High Command. He retired on 10 January 1980, and subsequently served as Deputy Minister for National Defence in January‚ÄìMay 1981. He died on 15 January 2008. He was married and had three children.

Plot The novel focuses on a veteran photojournalist named Clement Glass, and his struggle to come to terms with the aftermath of a church massacre. Although these events take place in an undisclosed African location, there are close similarities to Rwanda and the genocide of 1994. The novel follows Glass as he travels from Africa to locations in Europe and North America, and tries to reconcile his memories, while dealing with a family crisis, eventually journeying to Brussels, where the perpetrator of the massacre may be in hiding. Reception The novel received mixed reviews, with some critics praising the novels meditative approach and striking imagery and detractors citing the unsettling themes of the book being left unresolved as the main transgression. Reviewing for The Seattle Times, Michael Upchurch praised \\"a narrative that is alive, unpredictable and stirringly deep\\", stating that he found the \\"orchestration\\" of the protagonist's \\"flailing movements\\" \\"impeccable\\" and stated, of the novel as a whole; \\"it takes on its chosen terrain head-on and renders it into a shifting, complex fiction\\". In a review for The Observer, Stephanie Merritt commented on the difference between he language in this novel and Millers previous, historical, offerings, stating \\"his prose here is deliberately unadorned, an accumulation of observed detail in brief, one-clause sentences to create scenes of photographic reality.\\". She does note that this level of detail sometimes \\"weighs a little too heavily\\", however found the novel, as a whole, to be \\"profound\\" and \\"meditative\\", stating \\"it leaves the reader with a feeling of courage and, in the face of so much evidence to the contrary, hope.\\". Publishers Weekly also reviewed the novel in a positive light, finding the novel to be a \\"powerful study of emotional trauma\\" and \\"starkly illustrative\\". James Buchan, reviewing for The Guardian, was less positive of the novel. He stated that \\"the tempo of the narrative is slow and, like the adagio movement for a violinist, quite unforgiving of faults of technique and judgment.\\". Buchan also found the important scenes were not imbued by Miller with enough weight, stating \\"Big Themes are the curse of modern English fiction, and Miller may decide they are not, in the end, for him.\\". The novel was reviewed twice in The Daily Telegraph, neither of which positive. Kate Chisholm stated that while \\"Miller's writing is full of clever insights\\" she found that \\"in the end I felt uneasy\\", citing Millers \\"attempt to persuade us of moral equivalence\\" as the main factor for this. Additionally, Theo Tait also found the vastly varying themes to be the novels main detractor, stating \\"The book ricochets uneasily between moods and settings.\\" and that \\"Miller's attempts to link the Somerset story to Africa are less satisfactory.\\". He does, however, state that \\"It is a testament to the author's skill and intelligence that The Optimists is never quite as jolting as it sounds.\\". In a review for The Spectator, Sebastian Smee offered the same sort of critique, stating \\"Much of [the novel] is sophisticated and provocative, but it feels like an intrusion in the midst of a promising fiction. It is too persistent, too indiscreet.\\" and concluding with \\"Miller is a fine writer, but The Optimists is a moral voice in search of a convincing fiction.\\".

Computer anxiety In contrast to computer and Internet addiction, computer anxiety refers to \\"a state of heightened tension or a feeling of apprehensive expectation\\".Howard, G.S. (1986). Computer anxiety and management use of microcomputers. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Research Press. Behavioral presentations of computer anxiety include: \\"(1) avoidance of computers and the general areas where computers are located; (2) excessive caution with computers; (3) negative remarks about computers; and (4) attempts to cut short the necessary use of computers\\".Bozionelos, N. (2001). Computer anxiety: relationship with computer experience and prevalence. Computer in Human Behavior, 17, 213-224. Computer anxiety is mainly assessed by self-report scales using Likert-type formats. Age, gender, and computer experience are thought to be associated with computer anxiety. A meta-analysis based on studies published between 1990 and 1996 found that: (1) female university undergraduates are generally more anxious than male undergraduates, but the strength of this relationship is not conclusive; (2) instruments measuring computer anxiety are generally reliable, but not compatible with one another; and (3) computer anxiety is inversely related to computer experience, but the strength of this relationship remains inconclusive.Chua, S.L., Chen, D., & Wong, A. F. L. (1999). Computer anxiety and its correlates: a meta-analysis\\". Computers in Human Behavior, 15, 609-623. However, Bozionelos found that the youngest sample with the presumably earliest exposure to computerization reported the highest computer anxiety scores and demonstrated the highest prevalence rates. Also, WilfongWilfong, J.D. (2006). Computer anxiety and anger: the impact of computer use, computer experience, and self-efficacy beliefs. Computers in Human Behavior, 22, 1001-1011. found that computer experience did not have the largest significant relationship with computer anxiety. 3. Cybergenic stress syndrome It is defined by Norman as \\"that constellation of interrelated emotional, physiological, and behavioral signs and symptoms that accompany frustration, irritation, and hostility which, although provoked by interaction with computer hardware, software, network, and related 'help' systems, results in aggression toward people or organizations to the ultimate detriment of the person affected.\\" 4. Computer anger/rage Computer anger is defined by Wilfong (2006, p. 1003) as \\"strong feelings of displeasure and negative cognitions in response to a perceived failure to perform a computer task.\\" A similar term is computer rage, which is defined by NormanNorman, K.L. (2005). Computer rage and frustration: Results of an online survey. Technical Report LAP-2005-01. college Park: Laboratory for Automation Psychology and Decision Processes, University of Maryland. as \\"the physical bashing and verbal abuse of a computer or computer-related item.\\" Wilfong (2006) found that computer self- efficacy beliefs had the largest significant relationship with both computer anxiety and anger. Likert-type scales can be used to measure computer anger. Online help Individuals with symptoms of cyberpathology could turn to a computer for psychological help. There are large amounts of mental health information available online. And the number is growing dramatically with time. However, the information varies greatly in reliability. Psychologists also looked into the possibility of conducting psychotherapy online (e.g., Christensen, Griffiths, & Jorm, 2004,Christensen,H., Griffiths, K.M., & Jorm, A.F. (2004). Delivering interventions for depression by using the Internet: Randomised controlled trial. British Medical Journal, 328(7434), 265-269. Griffiths, 2005,Griffiths, M. (2005).

Life Early life Raised in Burton, Michigan, Wright graduated from Atherton High School while taking some courses through the Genesee Area Skill Center. He then attended Ferris State University. In 1974, he took a job with the Genesee County Drain Commission. Political life He became Deputy County Drain Commissioner in 1985. When the current Drain Commissioner Anthony Ragnone died in 1997, Wright applied to be appointed Drain Commissioner along with twelve other individuals. Ken Hardin was awarded the position. In 1998, Wright ran for the remaining term of Drain Commissioner. The incumbent, Ken Hardin was elected to the position. At that time, Wright started a water consulting business, Tara/Aqua Management. In 2000, Wright again ran for Drain Commissioner defeating Hardin in the Democratic Primary and winning the general election against Republican Robert Stewart. His platform was named the \\"Smart Growth Plan\\" which would reduce sewer spills, push for urban redevelopment, and retain farms and natural areas. An election supporting group, Friends of Jeff Wright, was investigated over using Flint City Council members' names and NAACP's name unauthorized in literature and investigated over possible improper campaign finance contributions. In 2004, Wright ran for reelection against Green Party Candidate Amber Carey and Republican challenger Robert Stewart whom Wright beat in the 2001 election by a 2 to 1 margin. In 2005 Wright was accused by Burton developer Blake Rizzo of money laundering. Rizzo made the allegations during an investigation by then Genesee County Prosecuting Attorney Art Busch into allegations that Rizzo committed insurance fraud and bribed officials relative to his property developments in the Burton area. The allegations became public when a 2003 transcript of Busch's interview with Rizzo was leaked to the media. No charges were ever filed against Wright and there is no indication Rizzo's allegations regarding Wright were ever even investigated. Wright denied Rizzo's allegations, noting that Rizzo admitted during the bribery and insurance fraud case that he committed perjury, which casts doubt on Rizzo's credibility. Busch stated that he did have enough evidence to charge Wright under state law. In 2006, Wright started the push to create the Karegnondi Water Authority started in 2010.

He is the director general of the Pasteur Institute since January 2018. Early life and education Stewart Cole was born in 1955 and grew up in Wales, where he was educated at Milford Haven Grammar School and then at Ardwyn Grammar School, Aberystwyth. Following a life-threatening bout of paratyphoid he developed an interest in bacteria, viruses and infectious diseases, which led to his reading microbiology at the University of Wales, in Cardiff (now Cardiff University) followed by research for his PhD at the University of Sheffield, England. Subsequently, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Ume√• (Sweden) and a research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut for Biology, T√ºbingen (Germany). Career and research Stewart Cole has been active in infectious disease research and global health for many years. Between 2007 and 2017, he was a full professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL, one of the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology).http://cole-lab.epfl.ch/ His laboratory at EPFL closed in December 2018. He was previously professor, senior vice president and scientific director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris (1983 ‚Äì 2007), which he later rejoined as president and CEO. His research accomplishments in microbiology have been widely acclaimed and are of direct relevance to global health and disease-control in both the developing world and the industrialized nations. Over four decades his team has investigated a range of topics including: bacterial electron transport systems; the genomics and diagnostics of retroviruses (HIV) and oncogenic papillomaviruses (HPV); antibiotic resistance mechanisms; and the molecular microbiology of toxigenic clostridia. Cole is best-known for his pioneering work on the genomics, evolution and virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria, especially those causing the human diseases tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy. Cole has supervised some 30 students for MS and PhD degrees, and trained 40 postdoctoral fellows and clinicians. With them, he has published over 350 scientific papers and review articles. He is also an inventor on many patents, several of which were licensed to industrial partners giving rise to diagnostic and therapeutic products that have found direct application in human medicine and helped save lives. Cole was scientific coordinator for the New Medicines For Tuberculosis project (NM4TB), running from 2006 to 2009 and the ensuing More Medicines For Tuberculosis project (MM4TB) running from 2011 to 2016 in the context of the FP7 European Union's Research and Innovation funding programme. This work led to the discovery of the TB drug candidate macozinone (MCZ) and the creation by EPFL of the not-for-profit spin-off iM4TB (Innovative Medicines for Tuberculosis ). MCZ is currently in phase 2 clinical trials. Director of the Pasteur Institute Stewart Cole was appointed as the 16th director general of the Pasteur Institute on 13 October 2017,https://actu.epfl.ch/news/stewart- cole-appointed-president-of-institut-paste/https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press- area/press-documents/professor-stewart-cole-appointed-president-institut- pasteur 130 years after its foundation, thus becoming the first non-French appointee. He took office on 2 January 2018, when he began to prepare the institute‚Äôs Strategic Plan for 2019-2023. The overarching ambition of the Strategic Plan is to give new impetus to basic research at the institute and to increase its impact on human health. Priority areas of the Strategic Plan include (re)emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, brain connectivity and neurodegenerative diseases. From the Strategic Plan it is clear that the four missions originally defined by Louis Pasteur for his institute - research, public health, training/education and translating research into applications of value to humanity - are as relevant today as they were in 1887 when the Pasteur Institute was founded.

It is on the right bank of the Kasai River, a few kilometers downstream from the point where the Lulua River enters the Kasai. It is at the highest navigable point on the Kasai in the dry season. Bena Makima was situated within the territory of the Kuba Kingdom. It was a post of the Compagnie du Kasai (CK). The post was a trading center, one of the locations to which the Zappo Zaps brought their ivory and rubber. Early in the 1900s a residence of the Catholic Prefecture Apostolic of Upper Kassai was established at Bena Makima.Catholic Encyclopedia The Presbyterian missionaries led by William Morrison had asked to be allowed to establish a mission there, but were refused. The company began a rubber plantation at Bena Makima in October 1904. In a unique arrangement, four missionaries of the order of Scheut fathers took charge of planting rubber and of gathering wild rubber in exchange for having their goods transported at no charge on the steamer from Kinshasa to Luebo. The missionaries ran the plantation using bonded Luba laborers, former slaves from eastern and central Kasai who had recently been liberated. On 5 November 1904 the post was attacked by the Kuba. The Europeans managed to drive off the attackers with the help of their foreign workers, and were relieved on 9 November by soldiers of the Force Publique led by De Cock and Hubin, who arrived from the east. With construction of the railway Bena Makima lost its importance as a transshipment point in the dry season, and after 1928 became less and less important.

It was directed by Romanian dancer and choreographer Edward Clug. The ballet is a rendition of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set to the music of Radiohead. Since 2005 Radio and Juliet has guested in the Netherlands, Italy, Singapore, Korea, Israel, Canada, United States, Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Serbia and Croatia. It has also been set on the companies of Bucharest National Theater and Kiev National Opera. On 15 September 2012, the 100th performance was celebrated on the old stage of the Maribor Opera house. The ballet premiered in the United States in 2008 at the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts at the Byham Theater. Noted for the ballet's choreography and simplicity, Radio and Juliet represents a modernized interpretation of Shakespeare. As stated by Edward Clug, \\"You could call this quite a twisted version... My intention was not to retell the story but offer the audience an experience from a different perspective.\\" Modernized Shakespeare The scenes and structure of the ballet do not match the original Romeo and Juliet written by Shakespeare. However, the conflict between the Capulets and Montagues and the masquerade ball scenes are included. The ballet begins with Juliet waking up from her deathlike coma to Romeo being gone and continues through her flashbacks. The ballet also uses video effects that zoom in on specific body parts of the cast during their performance. Every scene is a recanted memory of Juliet's. The play focuses on Juliet's perspective rather than the original storyline of the conflict between families. Juliet also does not take her own life like in the original play, as Edward Clug wanted to show her perspective after choosing to live rather than kill herself once she discovers Romeo dead; instead of Romeo drinking poison after thinking Juliet has killed herself, he eats a lemon. Major cast * Bojana Nenadovic Otrin (cast on Premiere) and Tijuana Krizman-Hudernik as Juliet * Eugen Dobrescu (cast on Premiere) and Matjaz Marin as Romeo * Christian Guerematchi/Edward Clug as Mercutio There are four other male dancers. The outfits worn by the cast are simple, the men wear suits without shirts and Juliet wears a corset. During the masquerade ball scene, the men wear surgical masks. Music The entire score of the ballet are songs performed by the British rock band Radiohead. Most of the music is taken from albums OK Computer and Kid A. The robotic voice from the album OK Computer matches the robotic choreography and is used for a solo by Juliet. The ballet uses 11 Radiohead songs including \\"Fitter Happier,\\" \\"Bullet Proof... (I Wish I Was),\\" \\"Idioteque,\\" \\"How to Disappear Completely\\", and \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\" The songs are used to create an atmosphere. The lyrics sometimes match the scene that is taking place like \\"Bullet Proof... (I Wish I Was)\\" during Mercutio's death scene. The song lyrics reinforce the fundamental element of the love story, struggling with relationships, however, the music is more important to the story as Edward Clug says, \\"There are moments when the story meets the lyrics, but that was not really the point. It's the overall emotion they create in their music.\\" The ballet includes the song \\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\" from the album OK Computer which was originally created for the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song appeared in the closing credits of the film but not on the soundtrack recording. Choreography The choreography is made up of sharp body movements. This is supposed to symbolize that love and romance have been affected by \\"the cold hand of mechanization.\\" Common movements include the arching of the torso, the bending of the wrists paired with elbow motions, and stabbing motions of the feet and legs. The choreography includes twitching and jerking motions which give the appearance of robots on stage. The scenes are structured in a way so that the characters move in a series of steps. First, they begin with head movements, then the body lifts, then the characters weave in and out one another where pairing and partnered dancing takes place. Twitching continues throughout the dance. When Mercutio dies, the last thing he does is twitch. This is the same for the final scene of the dance, Juliet executes slight head twitches over Romeo's dead body.

In her spare time, she was both a member of the American Legion Auxiliary and the Elmwood Ladies Golf League. In 1988 she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual personality.

Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio in 2009 was a biological classification system for a large group of predatory sea snails. This system was an attempt to make taxonomic sense of the large and diverse group which contains the family Conidae, the cone snails.Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009) Systematic classification of Recent and fossil conoidean gastropods. Hackenheim: Conchbooks. 296 pp., at p. 133 The authors proposed extensive changes to the family Conidae in contrast to the way the group was treated in the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005. Bouchet and Rocroi included in the family Conidae several other groups of toxoglossan snails which had previously been placed in the Turridae. For the over 600 recognized species of living cone snails, Tucker and Tenorio's classification system proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera. The authors discussed in detail 89 genera and five families in total (that have the inner shell walls resorbed during growth), including fossil cone snail genera and snails which were previously traditionally classified as turrids. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, and an analysis of then published molecular phylogeny (DNA) studies. The genera proposed by Tucker and Tenorio are recognized as an \\"alternate representation\\" by the World Register of Marine Species. The authors further proposed a modification to the classification of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) for ten additional Conoidea families (which do not resorb their inner walls) which included turrids which had been placed in the Conidae by Taylor, et al. in 1993.Taylor, J.D, Kantor, Yu. I. & Sysoev, A.V. (1993) Foregut anatomy, feeding mechanisms, relationships and classification of the Conoidea (=Toxoglossa)(Gastropoda). Bulletin of Natural History Museum of London Zoology 59:125-170. This proposed taxonomic classification separated the turrid snails from the cone snails, which were considered to be a distinct and diverse group. Illustrated plate of the shells of some cone snails from J.C. Chenu (1842) Illustrations Conchyliologiques Cone snails and the genus problem In 1758, Linnaeus, working only with shells, placed all the cone snails in a single genus Conus. In 1792, three genera were proposed by Hwass, five genera were proposed by Montfort in 1810, and then six genera by Kiener in 1845. In 1874, H.C. Weinkauff proposed a system of seventeen genera for the 352 then-known species of cones. This system of classification was adopted by G. W. Tryon in 1884.Weinkauff, H.C. (1873-1875) Die Familie der Coneae oder Conidae. Systematisches Conchylien-Cabinet von Martini und Chemnitz. Bauer & Raspe, Nurenberg, Vol. 4(2):125-244.Tryon, G.W., Jr. (1884) Conidae, Pleurotomidae. Manual of Conchology, structural and systematic, with illustrations of the species. Tryon, Philadelphia, Vol. 6:1-413; Pls. 1-31 (Conidae). In the 1930s, Iredale proposed several new genera, followed by B. C. Cotton in 1945, with twenty-nine genera.Cotton, B.C. (1945) A catalogue of the cone shells (Conidae) in the South Australian Museum. Records of the South Australian Museum 8:229-280, 5 pls. From 1956 onwards, Kuroda and other Japanese scientists introduced several additional new genera.Kuroda, T. (1956) New species of the Conidae (Gastropoda) from Japan. Venus 19(1):1-15, pl. 1. Ultimately dozens of genera and subgenera were being used. In 1937, J.R. Tomlin advocated that all cone snail species should be placed in the single genus Conus in the family Conidae, with the explanation that \\"the grouping of the Cones is as yet so little understood that I have made no attempt to deal with the growing number of subgenera and genera into which Conus has been dismembered.\\"Tomlin, J.R. le B. (1937) Catalogue of Recent and fossil cones. Proceedings of the Malacological Socitey of London 22:205-330. In 1979, Jerry G. Walls emulated Tomlin by confining all species to the genus Conus, stating that \\"although many subgenera or genera have been devised for the cones, only the single genus Conus with no subgenera is recognized here.\\"Jerry G. Walls (1979) Cone Shells a Synopsis of the Living Conidae published by T.F.H. Publications, Inc., Neptune City, New Jersey. Pages 1-1011, at p. 31. Subsequent experts in the field of cone snail taxonomy followed Tomlin and Walls, and retained all species of cones in the single genus Conus, making the Conidae a monogeneric family. This traditional Linnaean classification system, placing all species of cones in the single genus Conus, continued for decades before a malacologist proposed a different classification system. In 1991, A.J. da Motta published a new systematic classification of cone species at the generic level, incorporating all taxa previously named by other authors.A.J. da Motta (1991) A Systematic Classification of the Gastropod Family Conidae at the Generic Level published by La Conchiglia. 48 pp. A.J. da Motta's classification system, which covered both extant and fossil species, was based primarily on the shape and contours of the body whorl of the shell, and attempted to make generic classification of cones possible in an objective manner. This 1991 proposed classification used eight existing genera,Conus, Leptoconus, Dendroconus, Hermes, Profundiconus, Gastridium, Conasprella, and Cylinder, and sixty subgenera. A.J. da Motta's proposed classification was however not generally accepted. The last comprehensive treatise dealing with the family Conidae as a whole was the \\"Manual of the Living Conidae\\", by R√∂ckel, Korn & Kohn (1995). Only one genus, Conus, was used for the entire family, the authors stating that they considered there was still insufficient scientific data at that time to accurately define the diversity of the family.R√∂ckel, D., Korn, W., & Kohn, A. (1995) Manual of the Living Conidae, Volume 1: Indo-Pacific Region. Christa Hemmen, Wiesbaden, 517 pp. The Conus Biodiversity Website, by Alan J. Kohn and Trevor Anderson, notes that there are more than 500 recognized extant species of Conus, out of 3,253 species names published between 1758 and 2007. As of the date of The Conus Biodiversity Website's last update in October 2007, only the genus Conus is recognized for the entire family.http://biology.burke.washington.edu/conus/ The Conus Biodiversity Website, updated through October 2007. Modern taxonomic classifications Molecular testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn in 2005,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. In modern taxonomic classifications, cladistical analyses are performed using traditionally accepted taxonomic characteristics, including morphology (shell shape has been used for over 250 years as the basis for classification), and modern techniques including DNA analyses. Such studies have been conducted on many groups of gastropods, including cone snails prior to the publication of Tucker and Tenorio's treatise.P.K. Bandyopadhyay, B.J. Stevenson, J.P. Ownby, M.T.

Tucker and Tenorio‚Äôs 2009 proposed classification Tucker and Tenorio's 2009 classification system for the cone shells and their allies (which resorb their inner walls during growth) was based on a cladistical analysis of anatomical characters, including the radular tooth, the morphology (i.e. shell characters), as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies, all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees. In their phylogeny, Tucker and Tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades, corresponding to their proposed families and genera; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by Puillandre et al. and others.N. Puillandre, S. Samadi, M. Boesselier, A. Sysoev, Y. Kantor, C. Cruaud, A. Couloux, & P.

In 2010, a molecular phylogeny conducted by M. Watkins, et al. found that, based upon molecular studies, Conus chiangi (Azuma, 1972) falls within the Stephanoconus clade with 100% certainty. Further, Conus chiangi has peptide toxins that are virtually identical to those of the other Stephanoconus species. The authors opined that the specific peptide toxins were the result of strong natural selection in prey choice, as all Stephanoconus species prey on amphinomid polychaetes (also known as \\"fire worms\\").Watkins, M., Corneli, P.S., Hillyard, D., & Olivera, B.M. (2010) Molecular phylogeny of Conus chiangi (Azuma, 1972) (Gastropods:Conidae). The Nautilus 124(3):129-136. In their 2009 treatise, John K. Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio elevated the subfamily Conorbiinae (previously placed within the family Conidae) to the rank of family, based upon a cladistical analysis (as discussed above) which was used to construct phylogenetic trees. Shortly thereafter, in 2011, Bouchet et al. confirmed the elevation of the subfamily Conorbiinae to the family Conorbidae, based upon a detailed molecular phylogeny of a dataset of molecular sequences (of three gene (DNA) fragments), an analysis that was conducted across the superfamily Conoidea. Bouchet et al., further recognized Tucker & Tenorio's proposed modified classification, removing many turrid genera from the traditional cone snails, creating the following Conoidean gastropod families: Borsoniidae (which includes Tucker & Tenorio's family Cryptoconidae), Raphitomidae, Mangeliidae, Mitromorphidae, and Clathurellidae. Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011) A new operational classification of the Conoidea. Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. These studies effectively removed these turrid genera from the family which traditionally represented the cone snails. Significance of \\"alternative representations\\" As previously mentioned, prior to 2009, all species within the family Conidae were placed in one genus, Conus. In 2009, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species in the family: 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts using these multiple genera to explain the diversity within the Conidae include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011). Recent published accounts of the proposed family Conilithidae and its genera include: Tucker & Stahlschmidt (2010), Tucker, Tenorio & Stahlschmidt (2011), Bouchet et al. (2011), Puillandre et al. (2011), Tucker & Tenorio (2011), Petuch & Sargent (2011), and Petuch & Drolshage (2011).Puillandre N., Meyer C.P., Bouchet P., and Olivera B.M.

For example, the November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) used this system. The binomial names of species in the 82 living cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 were nonetheless recognized by WoRMS as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: \\"Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus.

It cost ¬£10,451,327 to build and, pays an annual rent of ¬£296,000 The school was founded by Sajid Hussain Raza, the school's first principal, who was convicted of fraud in August 2016 after diverting ¬£150,000 of Department of Education grants into his personal bank account, treating the Academy \\"like a family business employing his relatives there and, for at least the first 12 months, operating with no proper governance.\\" History When it opened, London's The Independent said the school \\"comes closest to David Cameron's vision of what a free school should be.\\" Kings Science Academy has a longer school day (8.00am‚Äì3.30pm) than most other schools, and the library remains open until 9.30pm \\"for those with no quiet space at home.\\" Raza anticipated that eventually 80% of pupils would progress into the sixth form and higher education, and that \\"most of them\\" would go to the top 20 research-led universities known as the Russell Group. One of the school's key supporters is Alan Lewis, vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and owner of the land on which the school stands. The school leases the land from Lewis at an annual cost of ¬£296,000 for 20 years. The school is operated by trustees Kifsa Ltd. and wholly financed by central government through the Education Funding Agency. The current premises were completed in 2012 at a cost of ¬£10.5 million. Fraud by senior staff Kings Science Academy was the subject of an investigation and report by BBC Television's Newsnight current affairs programme on 25 October 2013, following claims by a whistleblower alleging serious financial irregularities, nepotism and fraud. The investigation was launched when journalists obtained a leaked copy of a May 2013 draft report by the Department for Education's (DfE) Internal Audit Investigation Team (IAIT). The DfE subsequently published a \\"heavily redacted\\" version of the report. Ofsted judgments Following the school's first inspection in February 2013 the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) classified the school as \\"requires improvement\\" with regard to achievement of pupils, quality of teaching, behaviour and safety of pupils, and leadership and management. Overall, the school was classified Grade 3 (Requires Improvement). The school joined the Dixons Academies Trust and was renamed Dixons Kings Academy in January 2015. Classroom stabbing of teacher On 11 June 2015, teacher Vincent Uzomah was stabbed in the stomach by a 14-year-old pupil during a lesson in the school. The attack was premeditated, and racially motivated because the boy, of Pakistani heritage, \\"hated being disciplined by a black man\\". In August 2015 he was convicted of the attack and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Dixons Academies Trust The school is now part of the Dixons Academy Trust which includes this school, Dixons Allerton Academy, Dixons City Academy, Dixons McMillan Academy and Dixons Trinity Academy. In March 2017 Ofsted judged the school outstanding in all areas.

The top side of the body is orange-brown and continues gradually into the lighter underside. The hairs on the top of the body are tricolor: three quarters are dark gray, then there comes a black piece, and the point is orange. On the underside of the body, the hair is shorter and all areas are paler. The small ears are round and black. The naked skin of the lips and the nose are dark gray. The light gray whiskers are quite short, though they are longer than the other species. The front feet are dark gray and black and nude from the top and the lower side. On the underside of the feet are five cusps. The dark fingers have long narrow claws following a short nail on the thumb.

History A Diamant from 1960 The first Diamant-branded bicycles came out of Chemnitz, Germany. The company Gebr√ºder Nevoigt, Reichenbrand / Chemnitz (Gebr√ºder Nevoigt, Reichenbrand / Chemnitz) was founded in 1882, by Frederick and William Nevoigt. They started out manufacturing parts for sewing-machines and a line of higher-quality needles. In 1885, they added bicycles to their offerings. Following enthusiastic popular demand for their new bicycles, they added a new wing to the factory, and in 1895, the newly-branded Diamant bicycles began to roll off the new assembly line. Innovation continued: in response to existing bicycle chains' poor durability, in 1898 Diamant introduced a new double-roller chain, a design that was to become our modern worldwide standard, now in use on all sorts of machines, from bicycles to motors to industrial machinery. And in 1912, they introduced the \\"Damenrad\\" (ladies' bicycle), a new bicycle frame design for ladies, with a top-tube curving down, allowing to step through, instead of over, the bike. The model was dubbed the \\"Topas\\". Sales and demand continued to grow, and production capacity needs to be expanded once again. in 1906 the company went public to raise capital for the expansion, becoming \\"Gebr√ºder Nevoigt AG, Reichenbrand- Chemnitz\\". In 1920, racing sponsorship began, and by 1921, cyclists riding Diamant won 20 out of 29 races. During the depression in 1927, the company went under bankruptcy protection until 1928, when Adam OPEL Ag. acquired a controlling interest, relaunching the company, now Elite-Diamant AG. In 1934, Diamant introduced the delivery bicycle, with a large adjustable carrier on the front. During the same year, Diamant developed new tube-bending machinery, allowing the introduction of their \\"Gesundheitslenker\\" (health-beneficial handlebars), whereby the handles are facing the direction one is going, resulting in a more comfortable ride, on a model dubbed the \\"Holland-rad\\" (Hollander bike). In 1935, growth continued and employment reached 529 employees. But throughout all its history, the company's production rises and falls, following with tumultuous times and social change. Diamant developed stronger lightweight tubing, allowing the development of their racing bike, model 67, in time for Ernst Ihbe (Leipzig) and Carly Lorenz (Chemnitz) to win gold at the 1936 Olympic Games, and for Diamant to also be in gold position during the German National Championships, and the Worlds Championships in Z√ºrich. Throughout the second world war, Diamant became obliged to divert production and materials to help in the war effort. Even the well-known Diamant badge fell victim, no longer being made, to save on materials. After the war, during the Russian occupation, the company was taken over by the Soviet state-run company \\"Awtowelo\\". In 1951 the company grew to 1,588 employees, and at its head, Kurt Schneewei√ü set a new goal of 200,000 bicycles. In 1952, in recognition of its outstanding performance, economical and in job creation, a major part of the company was returned to ownership of the GDR (East Germany), and it became VEB Elite-Diamant (people's-owned corporation Elite-Diamant). In 1953, a record number of 295,000 bicycles were produced, and 1956 saw the 3-millionth Diamant bicycle come off the assembly lines. Production dipped to under 200k units, then rose again to 270k units in 1956, which included 10,000 higher-end sports bikes. These sales, combined with 1,764 flat knitting machines, brought total sales to 47 million DM. The company went through further growing-pains in the late-sixties, as the projections for 330k units turned out to be far off the mark, from the actual 550,000 units produced in 1969. By the seventies, Diamant was exported to other countries, under the names Elite-Diamant or Original-Diamant. Only in the neighboring West German market could Diamant not be sold under its own name, and was marketed under the name \\"Diadem\\" instead. Following the fall of the Berlin wall, Diamant became a public corporation again, under the name \\"Elite-Diamant ‚Äì GmbH Flachstrickmaschinen- und Fahrradwerken Chemnitz\\". In 1992, the bicycle production division was spun off as a separate corporate entity, \\"Diamant Fahrradwerke GmbH\\". 1996 saw the introduction of the \\"Handy- bicycle\\", a full-size folding bicycle, made of stainless-steel. The 10-millionth Diamant came out of the factory in 1998. In 2002, Diamant Fahrradwerke GmbH was acquired by the Trek Bicycle Corporation. The company introduced new models such as the Drive+ electronic drive-assist, and a line of Pedelecs eBikes. Today, the Diamant brand is focused on city, touring and sports riding. This contrasts with Trek's focus on racing, such that the two brands together span a wider range of users. In some case virtually identical models are sold under the Trek name in some countries while they are sold under the Diamant brand in Germany. The company is not connected with the Norwegian bicycle manufacturer of the same name.

A 12-episode anime adaptation by Arms aired between July and September 2012. It has been licensed in North America by Funimation with the Blu-ray version was released on December 17, 2013. Plot The story follows a world where several young men and women regularly find themselves spirited away to a world of sword and magic called . Those who survive and return are typically gifted with magic abilities. An international training organization named Babel protects these young returnees and trains them in the use of their power. A wayward hero named Akatsuki has come back to his world, along with a beautiful girl called Miu who is the daughter of the Last Dark Lord, whom he defeated in battle. Characters Class B ; : :Akatsuki is the male protagonist and the titular \\"Rogue Hero\\". Akatsuki is a tall young man, with messy purple hair and blue eyes. He is usually seen wearing either the standard Babel uniform or gym clothes; while in Alayzard he wears sleeveless medieval-style leather armour. Akatsuki returns to Earth after killing the Dark Lord and becoming a hero in Alayzard. The dying Dark Lord entrusted his daughter, Miu, to Akatsuki and to keep her safe, he brings Miu back to Earth. Like other returnees, Akatsuki attends Babel school along with Miu (who poses as his long lost sister - although while talking in his sleep, he reveals that his sister is dead.) Akatsuki is usually very laid back and displays an almost arrogant (although justified) confidence in his abilities. Although usually presenting a rough and perverted personality, deep down he is really a noble character. Though he does not seem to pay attention much in class, he performs very well academically. Akatsuki, unlike most Babel students, cannot use magic, since he did not learn or pick up any magic in Alayzard. However, he is a master of Renkankei-kik≈ç, which is the ability to control the Chi (energy flow) of oneself, others and the surroundings. He was taught how to tap into this power while in Alayzard and in the anime he states that he chose to learn this power in preference to learning magic. The full nature of this power has not been revealed. :Arms Device (or \\"AD\\" for short) are wristbands that are given to students during training. When an AD is worn, it conforms to the user's natural powers and abilities and transforms into the weapon most suitable for the user. Akatsuki could not initially generate an AD because he had only been given one of them and it was not strong enough to manifest his power. Upon noticing that something happened when he put on an AD borrowed from a fellow student in addition to his own (believing that his own may be broken), Akatsuki kept putting on more AD (seven) until his AD weapon finally manifested in the form a huge, unusual sword with tremendous power. The seven AD are the minimum number needed to manifest the sword - if he wears more AD wristbands the sword changes shape and becomes even more powerful. This other- dimensional sword, which is called \\"Laevateinn\\", has writings engraved upon it. Since discovering this new ability, Akastuki regularly employs it in battle. He also managed to control \\"Sleipnir\\", a magical supersonic motorcycle once driven by his father. ; : :Miu is the main heroine, and the Dark Lord's daughter, whom Akatsuki brought back to the real world to fulfill her father's last wish that he take care of her. Miu is portrayed as a sweet and innocent 16 year old girl with green eyes and pink hair that is usually kept in twin tails. She is a busty young girl of average height; a running gag being her difficulties in finding clothes large enough to fit her chest. She poses as Akatsuki's long lost little sister to conceal her identity and relies on him for guidance. Miu is initially conflicted about Akatsuki. She knows that she should resent him for killing her father, but she is also grateful to him for saving her from her enemies in Alayzard and looking after her in the real world. She gradually comes to accept that Akatsuki had his role to play (as the Rogue Hero) just as her father was the Hero's enemy and she falls in love with him. Miu has a high level of magical skills, being able to generate Shield Magic without any effort and also use multiple magic spells - from different elements, no less - at one time, and in rapid succession. She seems to favor using Air-type Magic, as most of her magical circles appear green in color. Miu's AD weapon takes the form of a staff with an elaborate head, called Holy Tin. So far she has only been shown using it as a blocking weapon. It is assumed this staff can enhance Miu's magic as well. ; : :Kuzuha is a young girl with turquoise hair and blue eyes. She is considerably shorter than the other students due to her age; she was originally enrolled in the grade school branch of Babel before being moved to the high school branch due to her remarkable intelligence. She is the class rep for Class B and takes her job very seriously despite her age. While not liking Akatsuki at first, she grows closer to him, even developing a small crush, after he helps her regain her spirit after an encounter with the Student Council. Akatsuki often teases her about her lack of stature, although not maliciously. She is a close friend of Miu, along with most of the other girls in the story. Her element is Earth and her AD weapon is a giant hammer. ; : :Chikage is Akatsuki and Miu's classmate. She is a friendly, tomboyish girl with short brown hair and amber eyes. She becomes friends with Miu immediately. She is also a lesbian, and shamelessly admits it, though she develops a slight \\"liking\\" for Akatsuki. Her element is Water and her AD weapon is a longbow. ; : :Kenya is a problematic student who was demoted to Class B from Class A. He does not get along with other students and tends to bully them. Akatsuki sets him in his place the first day of school, leading to him resenting Akatsuki, but during the Babel Ranking Tournament incident he bravely confronts Phil by himself. His element is Fire and his AD weapon is 2 pair of chakrams. Class A ; : :Kaid≈ç is the laid- back, troublemaker student who declares himself to be the \\"leftover\\" of Class A. Despite talking to Akatsuki only a few times, Kaid≈ç declares himself Akatsuki's best friend and calls him \\"Akki\\". He is implied to have ulterior motives (something to do with the organization known as Scarlet Twilight) and be very powerful, but so far has refrained from confronting Akatsuki, who he believes has yet to reveal his true strength. Student Council ; : :Kyoya is the Student Council's President. He has silver hair and blue eyes. A member of the COCOON, he usually has a manipulative smile on his face and cold look in his eyes. He is calm and collected towards Akatsuki's taunts to fight, however he has an interest in Akatsuki. He is also implied to have power equal to that of Akatsuki. His element is Ice and his AD weapon has not yet been seen. ; : :Haruka is the Vice President of Student Council who has long, green hair and green eyes. She takes an initial dislike to Akatsuki for his non- compliant behavior in school. This dislike escalates to a deep resentment after he humiliates her by stealing both her panties and bra while being disciplined by the student council. She often refers to Akatsuki a \\"wolf\\" and other predatory names, but she seems to develop a crush on him later on after seeing glimpses of the noble character hidden by his rough and tough exterior (during the hostage taking, for example). Her element is Wind and her AD weapons are two push knives (similar to Eskimo Ulu). ; : :Ryohei is the Secretary of the Student Council and has brown, short hair. His element is Fire and his AD weapon is a Dao (Chinese Broadsword). Although in Season 1, episode 8 it briefly shows him standing on the cliff holding a Dao in his right hand while another hilt is shown protruding from his left waist so it may be that he actually uses a pair of Dao. ; : :Minami is the Treasurer of the Student Council, who has long brown hair and brown eyes. A quiet girl, she says things only when she needs to. Her element is Earth and her AD weapon is a single headed chain weapon known as a Liuxing Chui (Meteor Hammer). Alayzard ; : :Listy is the Princess of Sylphid, a country in Alayzard, whose brother died protecting Akatsuki. After the Dark Lord's demise, she attempts to prevent Akatsuki from returning home, unaware of his oath to protect Miu. She also seems to have some kind of affection towards Akatsuki. (She also does the previews for the next episodes in the anime adaptation.) ; :Leon was a hero of Alayzard who was engaged to Listy. He was killed by Galious while fighting him alongside Akatsuki and a splendid tomb was constructed for him.

Bitter Blood is composed of various newspaper articles (from the Greensboro News and Record) and personal eyewitness accounts of several homicides in 1984 and 1985. The setting for the majority of the book is located in rural North Carolina and, more specifically, in Rockingham County and Guilford County. In a statement released by Barnes & Noble, Bitter Blood is described as a, ‚Äú‚Ä¶real-life drama of three wealthy families connected by marriage and murder. Bledsoe recounts the shocking events, obsessive love, and bitter custody battles which led to the bloody climax that took nine lives.‚Äù Synopsis Widow Delores Lynch lives in a big house, on a four acre lot. She has a good friend from church, who is perplexed that Dolores does not show up for a regularly planned meal out. When the friend drives to the Lynch house to try to learn what has happened, she finds Delores shot dead in her driveway. Later, daughter Jane Lynch is found, shot dead also, in one of the bedrooms. The crime had occurred several days earlier, and the killer had left behind no cartridge casings or fingerprints. With little in the way of clues for detectives to pursue, they question Delores's son Tom Lynch, who stands to inherit the estate. But Tom is eventually eliminated as a suspect, leaving detectives at a seeming dead end. One detective seeks the advice of a very experienced investigator, who tells him, \\"That family has a dark cloud in it somewhere. Find the dark cloud, and you've found your killer.\\" Tom, a dentist, had moved to Albuquerque, with his wife Susie Newsome. Susie's aunt, and namesake Susie Sharp was chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. The author uses the crime story as a motivator to interest the reader in a backstory of the talented Sharp family. Susie Sharp's father James Sharp, after starting a school that achieved success, but then burned down, and going broke trying to sell insurance, had moved to Reidsville, passed the bar and become a prominent local attorney, well known for his spirited defense of the accused. Susie Newsome was the daughter of Florence Sharp Newsome, the younger sister of Susie (the justice). Susie Newsome did not like Albuquerque, because inter alia folks did not react with stunned recognition at the name of \\"Sharp.\\" Delores had never taken to Susie, and increasing marital friction had nudged Tom to drift to the more welcoming arms of his dental assistant, leading to a difficult divorce and custody battle over the couple's two sons. Roughly a year after the murder of Delores Lynch, on May 18, 1985, Susie Newsom‚Äôs father Bob, mother Florence, and grandmother Hattie were shot to death in their home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Before his murder, Bob had agreed to testify in favor of Tom Lynch at an upcoming custody hearing. Because of this lead, police began to speculate that Susie played a role in the murder of her family. Indeed, Susie Newsome had formed an intimate relationship with her cousin Fritz Klenner, a habitual liar who started a medical practice in Reidsville, North Carolina, without ever obtaining a medical degree or license. Susie and Fritz became prime suspects in the murders. By June 1985, investigators had gathered substantial evidence and were about to make an arrest. However, on June 3, Fritz fired on police officers when they attempted to raid his Greensboro apartment, then fled the scene in an SUV with Susie and her two children. Fritz and the police became engaged in a low speed 15-minute police chase. When the SUV was stopped, Klenner opened fire with a machine gun, wounding three officers. Before they could respond in kind, he detonated an explosive charge inside the SUV, killing himself and his three passengers. Autopsies performed on the children showed that both boys had ingested cyanide and had been shot in the head at close range. Later the authorities determined that Susie Newsom ignited the explosives in the SUV. Aftermath In the wake of the deaths on June 3, 1985, forensics analysis began on the bodies of Fritz, Susie, John, and Jim. Both boys were found to have high levels of cyanide in their blood in addition to gunshot wounds to the head. It is assumed that due to the poison both children were unconscious during the police chase, and that either Susie or Fritz fatally shot them just prior to the explosion of the bomb. Susie's body was mangled from the waist down and many pieces of the seat were deeply embedded in her corpse. This led investigators to believe that the bomb was positioned underneath her seat, on the passenger side of Fritz's Blazer. Police officers found Fritz alive among the wreckage; however, he soon died from internal hemorrhaging. The following day, June 4, the police searched the Klenner household and found numerous firearms, explosives, and prescription drugs. Over 15 guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades, illegal military equipment, and a couple of claymores were found at Fritz's house. The police also found a case and a half of dynamite that was stored behind the Klenner residence. It is assumed that the missing half-case of dynamite was the cause of the explosion in the car. Inside Fritz's office, the police found evidence which showed that he was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and an avid supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. While it is a common belief that Fritz Klenner had the means and the motive to commit the murders, it cannot be proven beyond a ballistics report that linked a bullet found at the scene of the Lynch killings with a gun that Klenner and Susie sold to a North Carolina gun dealer.\\"Klenner-Lynch held responsible for slayings\\", Hendersonville N.C. Times-News, September 13, 1985. Susie's role in the murders still remains unknown. The prevailing theories are either that she convinced Klenner to commit the murders on her behalf, and thus had foreknowledge of the crimes; or that she had none, and blindly refused to consider that Klenner was involved, seeing any attempt by the state to investigate his possible role as an unreasonable persecution. Another figure in the case was Ian Perkins, a 21-year-old neighbor of Klenner's. Ian Perkins knew about Fritz's involvement in the murders of Susie's family, since he had driven Klenner to their homes. Perkins had been told by Klenner that the murders were a CIA operation. In 1985, Perkins went on trial and was sentenced to four months in jail and over five years of probation; he is currently seeking a state pardon.\\"Twenty Years Later, Klenner-Lynch Killings Still Raise Questions\\", WFMY-TV, 4:51 PM, Jun 3, 2005. Perkins was spared a life sentence thanks to a note from Fritz Klenner that read, \\"‚ÄúI‚Äôll write a paper saying you were not knowingly involved, that you believed you were on a covert mission for the government.\\"\\"Summerfield slaughter 30 years ago ended in deaths of couple, two sons\\", Hidden Tape Recording - Greensboro News & Record http://www.greensboro.com/news/crime/summerfield-slaughter-years-ago-ended-in- deaths-of-couple-two/article_5e74b69a-04af-11e5-9534-1393729c4a3c.html The judge noted Ian's naivet√©, gullibility, and immaturity as mitigating factors in his sentencing. Prior to the murders, in 1981, the SBI (State Bureau of Investigation) was given anonymous information that Fritz Klenner was \\"a dangerous psychopath who was practicing medicine without a license.\\" However, no investigation ensued after the discovery of this information. In retrospect, the attorney general of the SBI, Rufus Edmisten, said that this vital piece of information was never brought to his attention. Edmisten later admitted that he wished he had done something about the situation prior to its escalation. Adaptations In 1994, a television movie based upon the novel was produced, titled In the Best of Families: Marriage, Pride & Madness, and directed by Jeff Bleckner. In the Best of Families has a runtime of 200 minutes and it was originally released and played on CBS in a two part series on January 16 and 18, 1994. It is re-run on cable under the title Bitter Blood. The story was also adapted for an episode of Southern Fried Homicide on Investigation Discovery.http://investigation.discovery.com/tv-shows/southern- fried-homicide/southern-fried-homicide-videos/dating-her-first-cousin.htm On June 28, 2015, Snapped: Killer Couples aired an episode about the tragedy.

MILA is largely a part of economic integration efforts among the Pacific Alliance member countries of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. With the successful integration of the Mexican Stock Exchange with the Chilean, Colombian, and Peruvian bourses MILA has become Latin America's largest stock exchange. Investors are able to access MILA through one of the registered brokers that have access to the common trading platform for buying and selling stocks in any of the three countries. In the same way, the companies participating in MILA have increased availability to capital by means of new investors.http://diario16.pe/noticia/6592-a-quae-es-el-mila-mercado-integrado- latinoamericano History In September 2009, an agreement was signed by the Colombia, Chile, and Peru Exchanges, to create a unique market, with the objective to unite the equity trading platforms and in this way concentrate a bigger number of issuers, investors, and intermediaries. The formal ceremony was held in the location of BVL in Lima. The MILA started officially operations on May 30, 2011 as the second biggest market of Latin America in market capitalization with US$720 billion, and the third largest market in trading volume in the region with US$87,000 million a year. The Mexican Stock Exchange, BMV, announced its first trade made as part of MILA on 2 December 2014. The trade on MIILA was a $1,415 purchase of 200 shares in Chilean retailer Falabella, executed by GBM Mexico through GBM Chile. With the entry of Mexico into MILA, the integrated stock market now counts 798 issuers among the four countries, making it the biggest market by number of listed companies in Latin America, and the biggest in terms of market capitalization, according to the World Federation of Exchanges.

This velocity, caused by winds blowing over the surface of the ocean, is such that the Coriolis force on this layer is balanced by the force of the wind. Typically, it takes about two days for the Ekman velocity to develop before it is directed at right angles to the wind. The Ekman velocity is named after the Swedish oceanographer Vagn Walfrid Ekman (1874‚Äì1954). Theory Through vertical eddy viscosity, winds act directly and frictionally on the Ekman layer, which typically is the upper 50‚Äì100m in the ocean. The frictional surface flow (u) is at an angle to the right of the wind (45 degrees if viscosity is uniform in the vertical z-direction). This surface flow then modifies the flow slightly beneath it, which then is slightly more to the right, and finally the exponentially-weaker-with-depth flow vectors die down at around 50‚Äì100 meters, and finally form a spiral, called the Ekman spiral. The angle of each successive layer as we move downward through the spiral depends on the strength and vertical distribution of the vertical eddy viscosity. When the contributions from all the vertical layers are added up ‚Äì the integration of the velocity over depth, from the bottom to the top of the Ekman layer ‚Äì the total \\"Ekman transport\\" is exactly 90 degrees to the right of the wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. Mathematical formulation Suppose geostrophic balance is achieved in the Ekman layer, and wind stress is applied at the water surface: :f\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{u}=- abla\\\\phi+\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}}{\\\\partial z}, (1) where \\\\phi=p/\\\\rho_0,\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau} is the applied stress divided by \\\\rho_0\\\\, (the mean density of water in the Ekman layer)Ôºõ\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}} is the unit vector in the vertical direction (opposing the direction of gravity). The definition of Ekman velocity is the difference between the total horizontal velocity (\\\\boldsymbol{u}) and the geostrophic velocity (\\\\boldsymbol{u}_g): :\\\\boldsymbol{u}_e=\\\\boldsymbol{u}-\\\\boldsymbol{u}_g. (2) As the geostropic velocity (\\\\boldsymbol{u}_g) is defined as :\\\\boldsymbol{u}_g=\\\\frac{1}{f}\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\times abla\\\\phi, (3) therefore :f\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{u}_e=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}}{\\\\partial z} (4) or : \\\\boldsymbol{u}_e=-\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\times\\\\Big(\\\\frac{1}{f}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}}{\\\\partial z}\\\\Big). (5) Next, the Ekman transport is obtained by integrating the Ekman velocity from the bottom level (z=z_b\\\\,) ‚Äì at which the Ekman velocity vanishes ‚Äì to the surface (z=z_t\\\\,). : \\\\boldsymbol{U}_e=\\\\int_{z_b}^{z_t} \\\\boldsymbol{u}_e\\\\; dz=-\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\times\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_t-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_b}{f}\\\\Big). (6) The SI unit of Ekman transport is: m2¬∑s‚àí1, which is the horizontal velocity integrated in the vertical direction. Usage Based on Ekman theory and geostrophic dynamics, the analysis of near-surface currents, i.e. tropical Pacific near-surface currents, can be generated by using high resolution data of wind and altimeter sea level. The surface velocity is defined as the motion of a standard World Ocean Circulation Experiment/Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (WOCE/TOGA) 15m drogue drifter. Near-surface Ekman velocity can be estimated with variables which best represent the ageostrophic motion of the WOCE/TOGA 15m drogue drifters relative to the surface wind stress. Geostrophic velocities are calculated with sea level gradients which are derived from TOPEX/Poseidon sea surface height analyses (TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter sea level anomalies from along-track data is used here, interpolated to 1¬∞X1¬∞grid, spanning the domain of 25¬∞N-25¬∞S,90¬∞E-290¬∞E, during Oct1992-Sep1998).Fu, L., E. J. Christensen, C. A. Yamarone, M. Lefebvfe, Y. Menard, M. Dorer, and P. Escudier, 1994: TOPEX/POSEIDON mission overview, J. Geophys. Res., 99, 24,369-24,382. Geostrophic and Ekman velocity are assumed to satisfy the lowest-order dynamics of the surface velocity, and they can be obtained independently from surface height and wind stress data. Standard f plan satisfies geostrophic balance, the lowest-order balance for quasi-steady circulation at higher latitudes.Pedlosky,J., Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, 624 pp., Springer-Verlag,New York, 1979. However, coriolis parameter f is close to zero near the equator, the geostropic balance is not satisfied as the velocity is proportional to the height gradient divided by the coriolis parameter f. It has been shown in many studies that beta plane geostrophic approximation involving the second derivative of surface height is in good agreement with the observed velocities in the equatorial undercurrent,Lukas, R., and E. Firing, 1984: The geostrophic balance of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent, Deep Sea Res., Part A, 31, 61-66.Picaut, J., S. P. Hayes, and M. J. McPhaden, 1989: Use of the geostrophic approximation to estimate time-varying zonal currents at the equator, J. Geophys Res., 94, 3228-323. as a result, geostrophic currents which are near equator are obtained with a weighted blend of the equatorial beta-plane and conventional f-plane geostrophic equations.Lagerloef,G. S. E., G. Mitchum, R. Lukas and P. Niiler, 1999: Tropical Pacific near-surface currents estimated from altimeter, wind and drifter data, J. Geophys. Res., 104, 23,313-23,326. A negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly prevails in the eastern equatorial Pacific from October to January. A zone of strong easterly Ekman flow propagates westward into the central Pacific basin near the date line during December‚ÄìFebruary. Relaxation of trade winds in the eastern coincided with the eastward propagation of the geostrophic flow east of 240¬∞E (particularly in February), while westward currents dominated in the central and western equatorial region, which then reversal in the east, with weak local trade winds and weak upwelling along the coast, coincided with the onset of warm SST anomaly.(This anomaly first appeared off South America in March and April). Geostrophic current anomaly, like a Kelvin wave signature propagating eastward to South America between December and April can be easily discerned, and this arrival to South America also coincided with the above-mentioned SST anomaly onset. The geostrophic reversed in April to a strong eastward jet spanning the whole equatorial Pacific. As the El Ni√±o SST anomaly developed during May and June, this eastward geostropic flow persisted.

CAOCL is tasked with ensuring that Marines are regionally focused, globally prepared, and effective at navigating and influencing culturally complex 21st-century operating environments. CAOCL provides operationally relevant products and services and accomplishes its mission by ensuring a comprehensive response to the Corps‚Äô needs through various means. Policy and Planning CAOCL supports the Marine Corps in formulating policies, plans, and strategies to address regional understanding, operational culture, and language familiarization requirements across the DOTMLPF spectrum in support of the General Purpose Force. Regional, Culture, and Language Familiarization (RCLF) Program CAOCL serves as the administrator and coordinator of the Marine Corps RCLF Program, which is a career-long training and education program that begins at accession and instills, develops, and sustains a basic language, regional, culture (LRC) capability in our career Marines to ensure that the Corps has assets within each unit to assist in operational planning and execution in all operationally significant regions of the world. The RCLF Program is still under development but has met several key milestones on the path to full implementation, with three of six planned officer instructional blocks already launched and five enlisted instructional blocks becoming available in 2012. The initial concept was endorsed by the Commandant as described in the \\"Marine Corps Language, Regional and Culture Strategy 2011-2015\\". As of late 2011, there are over 8,000 Marine officers with regional assignments, with enrollment set to substantially grow with the launch of the enlisted instructional block for sergeants.USMC (2011). U.S. Marine Corps Concepts & Programs 2011: Americas Expeditionary Force in Readiness. Pre-deployment Training and Resources Language Familiarization Training CAOCL serves as the central point of coordination for language familiarization training for all General Purpose Force Marines other than foreign area officers and professional linguists. CAOCL uses a combination of on-staff language instructors, Defense Language Institute language instructors, and computer-based language training products to meet the operational requirements of Marines and units preparing for worldwide deployments. CAOCL language familiarization programs, regardless of method of delivery, all focus on mission-oriented tactical phrases most likely to be used by Marines during operations and exercises. In order to meet pre- deployment training requirements or home-station sustainment training requirements, CAOCL maintains Language Learning Resource Centers (LLRCs), which are technology enhanced classrooms equipped with culture and language study materials and software, at eight major Marine Corps bases and stations to facilitate culture and language training for individual Marines and units. CAOCL also provides phrase cards for ready reference in deployed environments. Operational Culture Training CAOCL provides operational culture training via mobile training teams for Marines and units deploying anywhere in the world, focused on those operationally relevant aspects of culture that will enhance Marines‚Äô ability to navigate and influence a specific operating environment during the accomplishment of their missions. CAOCL provides Operational Culture‚ÄîGeneral instruction, preparing units with skills to work within any culture around the world; CAOCL provides Operational Culture‚ÄîSpecific classes and briefs for units who need to learn about the culture(s) they will operate within during a specific deployment and mission; and CAOCL assists units in practicing techniques for incorporating operational culture into their planning process. CAOCL incorporates the integral skills of using an interpreter, understanding and using non-verbal communications, and interacting with a foreign population into culture training. Primarily for commanders and key personnel, CAOCL also provides Key Leader Engagement training, which combines culture and language skills for effective cross- cultural communications. Additionally, CAOCL publishes and distributes a variety of cultural reference material and field guides to assist Marines while deployed or during training. CAOCL Liaison Officers CAOCL Liaison Officers at each Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) assist units in accessing resources, scheduling training, and fulfilling culture and language training requirements. Operational Support CAOCL provides subject matter experts (SMEs) in direct support of the operating forces. These SMEs assist commanders in understanding the cultural terrain of the battlespace and in planning operations; serve as evaluators and advisors during mission rehearsal exercises; assist in scenario and exercise design when requested; and provide a reach-back resource for deployed forces for issues related to operational culture. Cultural Advisors (CULADs) to MEF and GCE commanders serve as special staff officers during pre-deployment training and deploy with the units as integral members of operational staffs for specified deployments to provide personal advice to commanders and to assist in integrating operational culture into the planning process. Professor of Operational Culture CAOCL maintains a faculty member at Marine Corps University (MCU) for providing instruction during Professional Military Education to MCU students on the concept of operational culture and its application in Marine Corps planning and operations. The professor also conducts ongoing research on the subject of operational culture. Translational Research Group The Translational Research Group (TRG) supports CAOCL's activities by providing the scientific basis and scholarship, specifically oriented on Marine Corps missions and guidance, required for training, education, policy, and programming. TRG conducts the work necessary to ensure that the globally applicable concepts and skills of social science are operationalized for use by Marines, as well as leveraging expertise from other organizations. TRG also has responsibility for developing valid assessment platforms to ensure CAOCL's activities are meeting the needs of the operating forces. TRG brings together scientists with critical disciplinary backgrounds that are uncommon in the Department of Defense. Therefore, although focused on CAOCL, TRG's expertise is also brought to bear on broader issues of interest to Training and Education Command, such as resiliency. References *USMC (2011).

Balfour was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage from 1896 to 1919. Mrs. Fawcett was President of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. As a non- violent suffragist, she was opposed to the militant actions of the Women's Social and Political Union, whose members were called the suffragettes. Life The tenth child of British Liberal politician and Scottish peer George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (eldest daughter of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland), she was born at Argyll Lodge in Kensington, London. Lady Frances Campbell was handicapped by a hip joint disease and from early childhood was in constant pain and walked with a limp. Her parents were deeply religious and involved in several different campaigns for social reform. She reportedly helped with these campaigns as a child, for example by knitting garments to be sent to the children of former slaves after slavery was formally banned by the government within the British territories in 1833. In 1879 she married Eustace Balfour, a London-based Scottish architect. Eustace's uncle, Lord Salisbury, had three terms as Britain's prime minister. Eustace's elder brother, Arthur Balfour, was also a Conservative British prime minister from 1902 to 1905. However, in opposition to the Conservative politics of her in-laws, Frances, along with both her parents, supported Liberal statesman William Gladstone and his government when she was a young women. Lady Frances Balfour and her husband never overcame these political differences and spent less and less time together. Suffrage Millicent Fawcett and Lady Frances Balfour at the Women's Coronation Procession She was the only member of the aristocracy and the only Scot to have a leadership role in the British women's suffrage campaign. She began her work for women's suffrage in 1889, when she became the constitutionalists' main liaison with Parliament. In 1897, she became a member of the Executive Committee of the newly-formed National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), whose President was Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and served in this capacity from its inception until some women got the vote in 1918. She was also the President of the London Society of Women's Suffrage, the largest single suffrage group in Britain, from 1896 to 1919. In addition, She served as President of the Lyceum Club, which rendered services to professional women, from 1903 to 1915. When her work for votes for women was almost over, . Lady Frances published six books, including her autobiography Ne Obliscaris (Dinna Forget) and she was joint editor of Women and Progress with Nora Vynne. The magazine was dedicated to achieving equal citizen rights for men and women. They were happy to see younger women excluded from having the vote as long as it applied equally to young men as well. The magazine appeared to be about to be a success when shortage of funds obliged it to fold in June 1914. Today the magazine serves as a good source of early suffragette history. Lyceum Club The writer Constance Smedley had decided to start a new type of club for women. Another proposed founder, Jessie Trimble, proposed that the new club be called the Lyceum Club, and the new committee arranged for Smedley to meet Lady Frances Balfour. The committee had decided to extend their net for new members from writers, to professional women and even the daughters or wives of prominent men. Balfour agreed to lead the new club and served as their chair for 15 years.History, Lyceum Club, Retrieved 21 June 2016 She died in London on 25 February 1931 from bronchial pneumonia and heart failure, and was buried at Whittingehame, the Balfour family home in East Lothian, Scotland.

Nelson originated from a tropical disturbance southeast of Guam towards the middle of March. Although the system was initially poorly organized, it developed rather quickly, and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Nelson on March 19\\\\. It tracked westward, and fluctuated in intensity for several days. On March 24, Typhoon Nelson intensified into a typhoon, and entered an episode of rapid intensification. On March 25, Nelson reached its peak intensity of , but thereafter moved ashore on the Philippines, where the storm weakened significantly. On March 27, the typhoon entered the South China Sea, and the next day, briefly re-intensified before resuming a weakening trend. Nelson dissipated on March 31\\\\. Affecting the nation less than a week after Tropical Storm Mamie did, Nelson was responsible for additional flooding across much of the Philippines. Fifty-six people were killed due to the typhoon, eight of whom perished due to drownings. Over 1,200 homes were destroyed. More than 165,000 people fled to shelters, including 83,000 that were displaced from their home. Thirty fishing boats and 23 ferries were destroyed due to the system. Damage amounted to $17.2 million (1982 USD). Meteorological history The second of three early season tropical cyclones to form in the West Pacific basin, Typhoon Nelson can be traced back to a low latitude area of disturbed in mid-March. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system at 0000 UTC on March 18 while a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued. Initially, the system was disorganized, but the disturbance was located in a favorable environment aloft and began to develop rapidly. Ten hours after the TCFA, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Early on March 19, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm. Later that morning, Hurricane Hunters reported winds of and a barometric pressure of . Based on this, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Storm Nelson. Nelson tracked westward, staying south of a large subtropical ridge. Despite the aforementioned favorable environment, Nelson briefly weakened late on March 19, but re-intensified slightly the following morning. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the system into a typhoon. Further intensification was halted due to increased easterly wind shear, and the storm began to level off in intensity as it accelerated on a westward course. On March 21, the JMA declared Nelson a severe tropical storm. According to the JTWC, the storm fluctuated between tropical storm and typhoon status for about 60 hours, even though the JMA suggest that Nelson did not become a typhoon until March 24. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Bising. After becoming a typhoon, Nelson forward's speed began to slow down as the storm began to move away from the ridge and encounter more conducive conditions. Consequently, Typhoon Nelson began to deepen more rapidly, and by the afternoon of March 25, both the JTWC and JMA increased the intensity to . Although the JMA suggests the system reached its peak intensity at that time, the JTWC indicated that Nelson strengthen slightly on March 25, and attained winds of , equivalent to a major hurricane or a Category 3 system on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Shortly thereafter, the storm moved ashore in the Philippine at peak intensity. After making landfall, Nelson weakened over the south-central portion of the nation. By March 26, the JMA had lowered the winds to . By March 27, Nelson re-emerged into the South China Sea, having weakened considerably, and data from both the JMA and JTWC indicated that Nelson was no longer a typhoon. The next day, Nelson briefly re-intensified slightly, and at 1800 UTC on March 28, the JMA estimated a secondary peak intensity of . On the following day, Nelson resumed weakening due to increased wind shear. Despite the presence of a trough, Nelson did not recurve northeast, and instead meandered westward. On the afternoon of March 31, the JMA ceased watching Nelson. On the next day, the JTWC followed suit while located about east of Nha Trang, Vietnam. Preparations and impact Typhoon Nelson was the second storm to strike the Philippines within a week, following Tropical Storm Mamie, which claimed 54 lives. Considered a \\"pre-season\\" storm by newspapers, Nelson required storm warnings for parts of the nation, which were broadcast via radio. Much of the southern section of the Philippines were placed on typhoon alert. Due to the threat of storm surge, residents in coastal areas were advised to evacuate to higher ground. Typhoon Nelson was responsible for significant flooding across the Philippines. On the offshore Leyte Island, a radio transmitter and a school were destroyed. In Cebu City, schools, businesses, and government offices were closed for a day. Across the low-lying town of Abucay, flooding occurred. A total of 1,261 dwellings were leveled, including 703 houses destroyed in the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, and Surigao, leaving approximately 83,000 people homeless. In Loreto Town, part of the Suriago Province, 95% of all coconut trees were toppled, and all but 45 of the town's 600 houses were demolished. A total of 165,462 persons evacuated to shelters. Widespread power outages occurred while many bridges were washed away. Shipping and air services were halted; 30 fishing boats and 23 ferries were destroyed. In all, 56 people perished due to Typhoon Nelson. Ten died in the hard-hit Leyte Province. At least eight of the casualties were due to drownings, which included two woman and an infant. Overall, damage from Nelson amounted to $17.2 million, crop and property damage alone totaled $7.4 million.

CST uses an incremental MAP (maximum a posteriori) change point detection algorithm to segment each demonstration trajectory into skills and integrate the results into a skill tree. CST was introduced by George Konidaris, Scott Kuindersma, Andrew Barto and Roderic Grupen in 2010. Algorithm CST consists of mainly three parts;change point detection, alignment and merging. The main focus of CST is online change-point detection. The change-point detection algorithm is used to segment data into skills and uses the sum of discounted reward R_t^{} as the target regression variable. Each skill is assigned an appropriate abstraction. A particle filter is used to control the computational complexity of CST. The change point detection algorithm is implemented as follows. The data for times t\\\\in T and models Q with prior p(q\\\\in Q) are given. The algorithm is assumed to be able to fit a segment from time j+1 to t using model q with the fit probability P(j,t,q)^{}_{}. A linear regression model with Gaussian noise is used to compute P(j,t,q)^{}_{}. The Gaussian noise prior has mean zero, and variance which follows Inverse Gamma(\\\\frac{v}{2}, \\\\frac{u}{2}). The prior for each weight follows Normal^{}_{}(0, \\\\sigma^{2} \\\\delta) . The fit probability P(j,t,q)^{}_{} is computed by the following equation. P(j,t,q)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi^{-\\\\frac{n}{2}}}{\\\\delta^m}\\\\left(A+D)^{-1}\\\\right^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\frac{u^{\\\\frac{v}{2}}}{(y+u)^{\\\\frac{u+v}{2}}}\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{n+v}{2})}{\\\\Gamma({\\\\frac{v}{2}})} Then, CST compute the probability of the changepoint at time j with model q, P^{}_t(j,q) and P^{MAP}_j using a Viterbi algorithm. P_t(j,q)=(1-G(t-j-1))P(j,t,q)p(q)P^{MAP}_j P^{MAP}_{j}=\\\\max_{i,q}\\\\frac{P_j(i,q)g(j-i)}{1-G(j-i-1)}, \\\\forall j The descriptions of the parameters and variables are as follows; A=\\\\sum^t_{i=j}\\\\Phi(x_i)\\\\Phi(x_i)^T \\\\Phi(x_i)^{}_{} : a vector of m basis functions evaluated at state x_i y=(\\\\sum^t_{i=j}R^2_{i})-b^T(A+D)^{-1}b b=\\\\sum^t_{i=j}R_i\\\\Phi(x_i) R_i=\\\\sum^T_{j=i}\\\\gamma^{j-i}r_{j} \\\\Gamma^{}_{} : Gamma function n^{}_{}=t-j m^{}_{}: The number of basis functions q has. D^{}_{}: an m by m matrix with \\\\delta^{-1} on the diagonal and zeros else where The skill length l is assumed to follow a Geometric distribution with parameter p g^{}_{}(l)=(1-p)^{l-1}p G^{}_{}(l)=(1-(1-p)^l) p^{}_{}=\\\\frac{1}{k} k^{}_{}: Expected skill length Using the method above, CST can segment data into a skill chain. The time complexity of the change point detection is O(NL) and storage size is O(Nc), where N is the number of particles, L is the time of computing P(j,t,q), and there are O(c) change points. Next step is alignment. CST needs to align the component skills because the change-point does not occur in the exactly same places. Thus, when segmenting second trajectory after segmenting the first trajectory, it has a bias on the location of change point in the second trajectory. This bias follows a mixture of gaussians. The last step is merging. CST merges skill chains into a skill tree. CST merges a pair of trajectory segments by allocating the same skill. All trajectories have the same goal and it merges two chains by starting at their final segments. If two segments are statistically similar, it merges them. This procedure is repeated until it fails to merge a pair of skill segments. P(j,t,q) are used to determine whether a pair of trajectories are modeled better as one skill or as two different skills. Pseudocode The following pseudocode describes the change point detection algorithm: particles := []; Process each incoming data point for t = 1:T do //Compute fit probabilities for all particles for p \\\\in particles do p_tjq := (1 ‚àí G(t ‚àí p.pos ‚àí 1)) √ó p.fit_prob √ó model_prior(p.model) √ó p.prev_MAP p.MAP := p_tjq √ó g(t‚àíp.pos) / (1 ‚àí G(t ‚àí p.pos ‚àí 1)) end // Filter if necessary if the number of particles ‚â• N then particles := particle_filter(p.MAP, M) end // Determine the Viterbi path for t = 1 do max_path := [] max_MAP := 1/Q else max_particle := \\\\max_pp.MAP max_path := max_particle.path \\\\cup max_particle max_MAP := max_particle.MAP end // Create new particles for a changepoint at time t for q \\\\in Q do new_p := create_particle(model=q, pos=t, prev_MAP=max_MAP, path=max_path) p := p \\\\cup new_p end // Update all particles for p \\\\in P do particles := update_particle(current_state, current_reward, p) end end // Return the most likely path to the final point return max_path function update_particle(current_state, current_reward, particle) is p := particle r_t := current_reward // Initialization if t = 0 then p.A := zero matrix(p.m, p.m) p.b := zero vector(p.m) p.z := zero vector(p.m) p.sum r := 0 p.tr1 := 0 p.tr2 := 0 end if // Compute the basis function vector for the current state \\\\Phi_t := p.\\\\Phi(current state) // Update sufficient statistics p.A := p.A+\\\\Phi_{t}\\\\Phi_t^T p.z := \\\\gammap.z+\\\\Phi_t p.b := p.b+r_t p.z p.tr1 := 1+ \\\\gamma^2 p.tr1 p.sum r := sum p.r+ r_t^2 p.tr1+2\\\\gamma r_t p.tr2 p.tr2 := \\\\gammap.tr2+r_t p.tr1 p.fit_prob := compute_fit_prob(p, v, u, delta, \\\\gamma) Assumptions CTS assume that the demonstrated skills form a tree, the domain reward function is known and the best model for merging a pair of skills is the model selected for representing both individually. Advantages CST is much faster learning algorithm than skill chaining. CST can be applied to learning higher dimensional policies. Even unsuccessful episode can improve skills. Skills acquired using agent-centric features can be used for other problems. Uses CST has been used to acquire skills from human demonstration in the PinBall domain. It has been also used to acquire skills from human demonstration on a mobile manipulator.

Story  An 11-year-old boy finds his father‚Äôs collection of X-rated videos hidden in a bedroom closet and subsequently develops an addiction to pornography that continues until the age of 26, when he meets his wife to be, and finds himself struggling to find the balance between fantasy and reality. But it's not all laughs in this coming of age story, which ends on a touching moment of redemption as our beloved main character finds true love and perspective which he compassionately shares with the audience. In a May 2012 interview with Village Voice columnist Michael Musto, Goffman revealed that he was actually 10 years old when he first discovered his father's pornographic video collection and that, at the age of 15, he had his first sexual experience.  History  Now in its 7th year running, the play was first performed on November 16, 2005, at the 45th Street Theater in New York City as part of the Double Helix Theatre Company's fifth annual One Festival. From there, it moved to the Triad Theater, running from February 2 to February 24, 2006. A percentage of the proceeds from these performances were donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids. The play then began a longer run at The Players Theater, also in New York City, from January 23, 2010, until June 25, 2011. The play moved to its current home, the 13th Street Repertory Company, on July 15, 2011.  International Premiere  On August 19, 2010, the play premiered in Argentina, at the ND/Ateneo in Buenos Aires' Cultural Center with Argentinian comedian, TV and radio personality Cabito (Eduardo Javier Cabito Massa Alc√°ntara) in the starring role. The show's theme has resonated globally and has successfully expanded its reach throughout Europe and Latin America including: Panama, where it received a nod for Best Theatrical Comedy of 2013. Playing at the 100-seat La Quadra Theatre, the lead role went to renowned actor Aaron Zebede,Playbill.com who appears alongside Benicio del Toro in the film \\"Escobar: Paradise Lost\\" and with Robert De Niro and Usher in the upcoming film \\"Hands of Stone\\". Malta, where it ran at the St. James Theater in Valletta, starring Malcolm Galea, with Marc Cabourdin holding the directorial reins. Switzerland, where the Swiss debut featured actor-comedian Beat Schlatter at the Theater Stok in Zurich. Upcoming productions will be Norway, playing the 700-seat Kilden Theater in Kristiansand and the prestigious Christiana Theater in Oslo.  Milestones  The show celebrated its 200th performance on September 10, 2011.

The model name is written in Kendall's notation, and is an extension of the M/M/c queue, where service times must be exponentially distributed and of the M/G/1 queue with a single server. Most performance metrics for this queueing system are not known and remain an open problem. Model definition A queue represented by a M/G/k queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0,1,2,3...}, where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the queue, including any being served. Transitions from state i to i + 1 represent the arrival of a new customer: the times between such arrivals have an exponential distribution with parameter Œª. Transitions from state i to i ‚àí 1 represent the departure of a customer who has just finished being served: the length of time required for serving an individual customer has a general distribution function. The lengths of times between arrivals and of service periods are random variables which are assumed to be statistically independent. Steady state distribution Tijms et al. believe it is \\"not likely that computationally tractable methods can be developed to compute the exact numerical values of the steady-state probability in the M/G/k queue.\\" Various approximations for the average queue size, stationary distribution and approximation by a reflected Brownian motion have been offered by different authors. Recently a new approximate approach based on Laplace transform for steady state probabilities has been proposed by Hamzeh Khazaei et al.. This new approach is yet accurate enough in cases of large number of servers and when the distribution of service time has a Coefficient of variation more than one. Average delay/waiting time There are numerous approximations for the average delay a job experiences. The first such was given in 1959 using a factor to adjust the mean waiting time in an M/M/c queue This result is sometimes known as Kingman's law of congestion. :E[W^{\\\\text{M/G/}k}] = \\\\frac{C^2+1}{2} \\\\mathbb E [ W^{\\\\text{M/M/}c}] where C is the coefficient of variation of the service time distribution. Ward Whitt described this approximation as ‚Äúusually an excellent approximation, even given extra information about the service-time distribution.\\" However, it is known that no approximation using only the first two moments can be accurate in all cases. A Markov‚ÄìKrein characterization has been shown to produce tight bounds on the mean waiting time. Inter-departure times It is conjectured that the times between departures, given a departure leaves n customers in a queue, has a mean which as n tends to infinity is different from the intuitive 1/Œº result. Two servers For an M/G/2 queue (the model with two servers) the problem of determining marginal probabilities can be reduced to solving a pair of integral equations or the Laplace transform of the distribution when the service time distribution is a mixture of exponential distributions. The Laplace transform of queue length and waiting time distributions can be computed when the waiting time distribution has a rational Laplace transform.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Blackburn with Darwen, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History St Silas' was designed in 1878 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin, but building did not start until 1894. The first phase was completed by 1898, this did not include the tower. The church cost ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and provided seating for 609 people. The tower, measuring in height, was not added until 1913‚Äì14. At the same time a porch was built, but the planned spire was never added; this phase cost over ¬£6,000. Before the church was built, services had been held from 1846 in a nearby Sunday school, and then in a school built in 1884‚Äì85. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone with freestone dressings. The external walls are in yellow sandstone; the internal walls in red sandstone. The roofs are slated. Its plan consists of a nave with north and south aisles, a southwest porch, a north transept containing the organ chamber, a south transept comprising a chapel, a chancel with a north vestry, another vestry in the angle between the south transept and aisle, and a west tower. The architectural style is Gothic Revival, described in the National Heritage List as Perpendicular, and by the authors of the Buildings of England series as Decorated. The tower is in three stages, with angle buttresses, and a polygonal stair turret at the southwest corner that rises to a level higher than the tower. On the summit of the tower are pierced embattled parapets and pinnacles. The tower has a west doorway, above which is a five-light window. In its middle stage are pairs of ogee-headed windows, clock faces, and a frieze of shields. The top stage contains louvred bell openings, one on the south side, and two in pairs on each of the other sides. Along the walls of the aisles are large four-light windows. The porch is tall with an embattled parapet, canted angles, and angle buttresses. Above its moulded entrance arch is a statue of Saint Silas in a niche surmounted by a pinnacle. The transepts contain pairs of square-headed two-light windows, and have embattled parapets. The chancel has a south square-headed two-light window, a seven-light east window, a parapet of blind quatrefoils, and a southeast turret with a spirelet. Interior The appearance of the interior of the church is \\"one of spaciousness, nobility and grandeur imparted by the handling of the proportions\\". It is \\"richly furnished in a high-church fashion\\". The tower arch is triple-chamfered, while the chancel arch and the transept arches are all double-chamfered. The arcades consist of double-chamfered arches carried on square piers that are set diagonally. In the chancel are a round-headed sedilia and piscina. The octagonal font dates from 1896, and is carved with buttresses and blind tracery. It has a tall wooden 20th-century cover in Gothic style. The square pulpit also dates from 1896, it was made by Dent and Marshall from Runcorn stone, carved with blind tracery. The alabaster reredos was imported from Italy in 1915, and contains niches, canopies, and statues. The stained glass in two of the windows was made by Morris & Co. in 1908 and 1911. The design of the earlier window is based on cartoons by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, although both were dead by the time the windows were made. It depicts Saint Anne and the Adoration of the Magi. The later window was designed by J. H. Dearle, and depicts the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. In addition there is a window designed by Henry Holiday towards the end of his career in 1921‚Äì23, which depicts Old Testament figures, including David and Gideon with angels. The three-manual organ was built in 1904 by Harrison and Harrison of Durham. It was altered in 1925 by the same firm, and in 1991 by J. Corkhill of Wigan. There is a ring of eight bells, all of which were cast in 1888 by John Taylor and Company of Loughborough.

It is a troglobite, known only from an anchialine pool in a cave in the Bahamas. It differs from other stenopodideans by the enlargement of its third maxilliped. Description The holotype of M. bahamaensis has a total length (TL) of (carapace length, CL, ); the paratype is smaller at TL , CL . In common with other troglobitic species, the body lacks pigments, and the eyes are vestigial. Like other stenopodideans, Macromaxillocaris has chelae (claws) on the first three pairs of pereiopods (walking legs); it differs from them by the size of the third maxilliped, which is greatly enlarged in Macromaxillocaris, and is the strongest of all the animal's appendages. Distribution and habitat Macromaxillocaris bahamaensis is the first species discovered among the Stenopodidea to be adapted to a troglobitic lifestyle. It was found in an anchialine pool in Oven Rock Cave on Great Guana Cay, a short distance west of Exuma Cays in the Bahamas. Oven Rock Cave was first explored in 1993 and contains at least 20 species of stygobiont, and is thus a hotspot of subterranean biodiversity. The entrance to the cave is on a hillside, and leads to a small lake, deep, but which is connected to an underwater room, which is in turn connected to other passages; over has been explored. The water in the lake has a salinity of 28.3 ppt at the surface, but increases with increasing depth to around 33‚Äì35 ppt at a depth of . Macromaxillocaris is thought to live on the ceiling of the caves, or in fissures in the bedrock, since it was only observed by divers as they returned to the surface, presumably having been dislodged by the divers' exhaust bubbles. Taxonomy Macromaxillocaris bahamaensis was described in 2006 by Fernando Alvarez, Thomas M. Iliffe and Jos√© Luis Villalobos, in an article in the Journal of Crustacean Biology. As well as a new species and genus, the authors erected a new family, placed in the infraorder Stenopodidea. This was the first major addition to the taxonomy of the infraorder for some time, the previous new family being Spongicolidae, created by Frederick Schram in 1986. The name Macromaxillocaris derives from the Greek root macros (meaning \\"long\\"), the Latin maxillaris (meaning \\"jaw\\"), and the Greek karis (meaning \\"shrimp\\"); it refers to the exceptional length of the third maxilliped of Macromaxillocaris.

Instructions for the Directors of Clinics, Outpatient Clinics and Other Medical Facilities  In 1892, Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser, a German physician who is credited with the discovery of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, performed two sets of clinical trials attempting to find a method of prevention for syphilis. Neisser first inserted serum obtained from a single patient who had begun exhibiting the early signs of syphilis under the skin of four female patients,Vollmann, Jochen, and Rolf Winau. \\"Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg code.\\" BMJ: British Medical Journal 313.7070 (1996): 1445. similar to the procedure for smallpox inoculation. Neisser did not obtain consent from these patients, but none of them developed the disease. Neisser then conducted the second set of trials on four prostitutes.Ligon, BL. Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser: discoverer of the cause of gonorrhea. Semin Pediatr Infect Dis. 2005 Oct;16(4):336-41. This time, the serums were injected intravenously and each serum was obtained from a different syphilis patient, each at various stages of the disease. The prostitutes from the second set of trials also neither consented nor were informed of the experimentation. Unlike the first set of trials, all four of the subjects developed syphilis at varying times after the injection. In 1898, Neisser published his results from the clinical experiments he conducted, triggering a public outcry in which Neisser was accused of ‚Äúmaliciously inoculating innocent children with syphilis poison.‚ÄùJ.D. Oriel . Eminent venereologists: Albert Neisser. Genitourin Med, 65 (1989), pp. 229‚Äì234 Neisser defended his actions, arguing that the prostitutes contracted syphilis from their line of work rather than his experiments, and had the general support of academic physicians. One notable exception was the German psychiatrist Albert Moll, who believed informed consent to be necessary in human trials. Later that year, the Royal Disciplinary Court fined Neisser, ruling that he was negligent in obtaining consent from patients. In 1899, the Prussian minister for religious, academic, and medical affairs sought advice regarding the ethicality of Neisser's experiments in response to a request from the Prussian parliament to take measures regarding the scandal, and commissioned a report from the Scientific Medical Office of Health. In 1900, the minister issued the ‚ÄúInstructions for the Directors of Clinics, Outpatient Clinics and Other Medical Facilities‚Äù for all medical directors regarding any medical procedure ‚Äúother than for diagnosis, therapy, and immunization‚Äù. The instructions state that medical experimentation would be prohibited if: * the subject is a minor. * the subject has not provided unambiguous consent. * possible negative consequences have not been explained. * there is no authorization from the medical director. These instructions were not committed to law and as such were not legally binding. To this day, it remains unclear if the Prussian directive had any effect on human experimentation; however, these were still the first regulations regarding human medical experimentation in Western medicine. Guidelines for Human Experimentation One of the earliest models for ethical human experimentation, preceding the Nuremberg Code, was established in 1931.Timms, Olinda. Bio-Medical Ethics. (2016), pp. 179 In the Weimar Republic of 20th century pre-Nazi Germany, the entity known as Reichsgesundheitsamt Sass, HM. \\"Reichsrundschreiben 1931: Pre-Nuremberg German Regulations Concerning New Therapy and Human Experimentation,\\" Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 8 (1983): 99-111. (translating roughly to National Health Service), under the Ministry of the InteriorACHRE Chapter 2: Nuremburg and Research with Patients (1995) formulated a list of 14 points detailing these ethical principles. The main points of the 1931 Guidelines for Human Experimentation are as follows: * Full unambiguous and informed consent from test subjects is required, except in extreme extenuating circumstances. * Risks should be balanced out by potential benefits. * Caution should be taken for subjects under 18 years old. * Extreme caution should be taken if microorganisms are involved. * Poor or socially disadvantaged subjects should not be exploited. * Animal testing should be conducted first, and human experiments are to be avoided if other means of collecting data are still available. The Guidelines were formed under the context of reforming criminal law in Germany and in partial response to public criticism of human experimentation. They also outline specific definitions for both therapeutic and non-therapeutic research in human subjects (dubbed ‚Äúinnovative therapy‚Äù and ‚Äúscientific experimentation‚Äù), and set forth detailed boundaries for both. However, the vast majority of the physicians discussing the regulations prior to their instantiation were concerned primarily with the proper advancement of medical science rather than the protection of vulnerable patients.Human Sacrifice and Human Experimentation: Reflections at Nuremberg, 22 Yale Journal of International Law 401 (1997) The Guidelines shares similarities with the 1900 Prussian Instructions for the Directors in that both contain clauses for needing consent and for subjects who are underage. The Nuremberg Code would also later specify a requirement for informed consent, and contains other additional similarities to the Guidelines ‚Äì for instance, both require risk to be balanced out by potential benefits, and both discourage the use of human experimentation if other means of obtaining the desired results are available. While the two are similar,Ghooi, R. B. (2011). The Nuremberg Code‚ÄìA critique. Perspectives in Clinical Research, 2(2), 72‚Äì76. the Guidelines contain more clauses and requirements regarding human experimentation. For example, the Guidelines also necessitate the creation of a report detailing the purpose and justification of the experiment. Ravindra Ghooi was critical of the Nuremberg Code, arguing that it bears too strong of a resemblance to the 1931 Guidelines to pass as coincidence, and that the 1931 Guidelines must have been used as reference in creating the Code. However, the Nuremberg Code does contain stipulations not found in the Guidelines ‚Äì the clause requiring subjects be given the freedom to leave the experiment at any time is one such example. The Guidelines for Human Experimentation remained in effect through the end of the Third Reich in 1945, and continued to exist in the law until 1948. Notably, Nazi human experimentation occurred under the existence of these laws. Nuremberg Code In the early 1940s in Germany doctors conducted Nazi human experimentation on unwilling test subjects; one way of describing the procedures could be to call it medical torture. After the Allied Forces won World War II, United States authorities who held the Nuremberg Palace of Justice used that building to host the Doctors' Trial in which Nazi researchers were charged with crimes against humanity for unethical research practices. After the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials many people felt compelled to create laws to codify some research guidelines to protect research participants and define acceptable relationships between researchers and research participants. In 1949 the Nuremberg Code was published to be a set of guidelines to guide researchers who work with human subjects. Among the points of the code are the following concepts: participants must continually give their voluntary consent, the study must have the goal of producing good for society, and considerations must be taken to protect participants from even the remote possibility of injury. Declaration of Helsinki In 1964, the World Medical Association published a code of research ethics, the Declaration of Helsinki. It was based on the Nuremberg Code, focusing on medical research with therapeutic intent. Subsequently, medical professionals and researchers began requiring that research follows the principles outlined in the Declaration. This document was one of the milestones towards the implementation of the institutional review board (IRB) process. Many IRBs review ethical aspects of clinical researches based on the Declaration of Helsinki codes. Belmont Report The Tuskegee syphilis experiment was an experiment begun in 1932 by the United States Public Health Service. The design of the experiment involved recruiting 400 poor black people with syphilis and tracking their health. In the 1940s penicillin was identified as standard treatment for syphilis, but the purpose of the experiment was to track long-term syphilis and researchers did not inform the participants that they could be cured. In 1972 press reported on the study to public outrage for disregard of the health of the participants. The study was influential in shaping public perceptions of research involving human subjects. After the press exposed the study, the US Congress appointed a panel that determined that the study should be stopped immediately and that the oversight of human research was inadequate. The panel recommended that federal regulations be designed and implemented to protect human research subjects in the future. Subsequently, the National Research Act of 1974 led to the creation of the Common Rule, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, and the Office for Human Research Protections All of these reactions led to the 1979 creation and publishing of the Belmont Report. This report identifies respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as ethical principles which must underlie human subject research. APA Ethics Code The American Psychological Association (APA) has a documented ethics code pertaining to the practice of psychology and associated research. This document contains guidelines for the use of deception in research. For members of the APA, these are hard requirements levied against their membership. They are also requirements for any research project conducted, funded, or managed by the APA.  Research funded by the United States government Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 (45 CFR 46) is the primary set of Federal regulations regarding the protection of human subjects in research and is often referred to as the Common Rule. It defines the laws, criteria for exemption, as well as definition and formulation of institutional review boards, though some agencies have established their own implementation of this code that supersedes portions or all of 45 CFR 46. The Department of Defense uses CFR 46 but has different exemption criteria. The Food and Drug Administration also applies a modified code that is associated with research into development of any food, drug, or medical devices. The code establishes what is required to be considered research activities, and for participants to be considered human subjects of research. The definitions are written as such to include situations where the human is the subject of the experiment, their environment is manipulated by the researchers, and data regarding their responses are collected. If the project does not meet these definitions (or there is minimal risk to participants) then the project is exempt from IRB review and the requirements of informed consent. Generally this decision is made and documented by an IRB. The common rule also provides definitions regarding whether institutions are engaged in research, interaction between investigators and subjects, what an intervention is, and what information subjects can expect to remain private.

She was born the daughter of a plantation owner on September 12, 1853 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. She was orphaned by age 10 and was taken under the care of relatives until her uncle's death five years later. At that point, she took up a job as a community schoolteacher to support her younger brother and her sister but struggled with her early teaching experiences. Parrish's early life was difficult, but she was determined to support her family and to obtain an education for herself. In 1874, she accepted a position as a teacher in Danville, Virginia which allowed her to begin taking classes at Roanoke Female College with her younger sister. In 1876, she graduated but went on to take two more years of schooling at the Virginia State Normal School. In 1892, Parrish had gained a significant reputation for her teaching and was offered a position at the newly opened Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia as the chair of mathematics. Under this position, she was also responsible for philosophy, pedagogy, and psychology. In order to gain a better understanding of the field of psychology, she enrolled in a summer session at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York to study under the famous American psychologist E. B. Titchener. Although Titchener is known as a rigid sexist (no women were permitted to join his Society for Experimental Psychology), he did accept a number of female graduate students, including Parrish. After Parrish returned to Randolph-Macon, Titchener initially refused to do any correspondence work with her. She begged him to change his mind, urging him that ‚Äúyou must help me. A man who sits down to the rich feasts which are spread before you has no right to deny a few crumbs to a poor starveling like me (Parrish, 1925, p. 3).‚Äù Titchener relented and the two eventually became good friends. Writings Her efforts were rewarded when she achieved a publication in 1895 in The American Journal of Psychology with Titchener titled ‚ÄúMinor studies from the psychological laboratory of Cornell university: VII the cutaneous estimation of open and filled spaces‚Äù. This study had seven subjects, two of which were Mr. and Mrs. Titchener. Her second publication with Titchener titled ‚ÄúMinor Studies from the Psychological Laboratory of Cornell University: Localization of cutaneous impressions by arm movement without pressure upon the skin.‚Äù was also published in The American Journal of Psychology in 1897. This work, largely inspired by Pillsbury and Washburn, added to the relevant information during that time of localization and perception of feeling on the skin. Impact and legacy Parrish's work with Titchener inspired her to follow more of an experimental approach in her work. She approached the President of Randolph-Macon for $25 in order to set up a psychology lab in Lynchburg, Virginia. Due to Parrish's hard work, determination and love for teaching, she opened up the ‚Äúfirst psychology laboratory in the south‚Äù. This act definitely put Parrish on the map as a very notable psychologist. Accomplishing such a prestigious monument as a prejudiced woman in academia is very admirable. Parrish stayed at Randolph-Macon until 1902 when she moved to teach at State Normal School of Georgia in Athens. Again, she established a psychology lab at this university, largely donated by George Peabody. She was in charge of the lab and taught courses (some in child psychology) until 1911 when she became the State Supervisor of Schools in Georgia, which she remained as until her death in 1918. As State Supervisor she was in charge of thousands and more than 3,800 teachers. She traveled frequently training teachers and campaigning for money for schools to ensure the best possible education. As a highly educated woman during a time that did not appreciate such a thing, Celestia Parrish accomplished many amazing feats. She established two psychology laboratories, one being the first in the region, influencing and moving towards a field of psychology that is more focused on experimentalism. She taught university level classes at a time when women were not even allowed to attend university and invested an incredible amount of time to Georgia's educational system. She was truly an inspiring woman both in the field of psychology and in life, as noted on her epitaph which reads: ‚ÄúGeorgia‚Äôs Greatest Woman‚Äù.

Biological applications of silanization Nanoscale analysis of proteins using atomic force microscopy (AFM) requires surfaces with well-defined topologies and chemistries for many experimental techniques. Biomolecules, particularly proteins, can be immobilized simply on an unmodified substrate surface through hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. However, several problems are associated with physical adsorption of proteins on surfaces. With metal surfaces, protein denaturation, unstable and reversible binding, nonspecific and random immobilization of protein have been reported. One alternative involves the interaction of chemically modified surfaces with proteins under non-denaturing circumstances. Chemical modification of surfaces provides the potential to precisely control the chemistry of the surface, and with the correct chemical modifications, there are several advantages to this approach. First, the proteins adsorbed on the surface are more stable over a wide range of conditions. The proteins also adopt a more uniform orientation on the surface. Additionally, the higher density of protein deposition with greater reproducibility is possible. Chemical modification of surfaces has been successfully applied in several instances to immobilize proteins in order to obtain valuable information. For instance, atomic force microscopy imaging of DNA has been performed using mica coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The negatively charged DNA backbone bound strongly to the positive charges on the amine functionality, leading to stable structures that could be imaged both in air and in buffer. In a recent study by Behrens et al., amine-terminated silicon surfaces were successfully used to immobilize bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) for medical purposes (cf. hydrogen-terminated silicon surface). 14 Molecules with amine groups (especially APTES) are important for biological applications, because they allow for simple electrostatic interactions with biomolecules. Functionalization of surfaces using self-assembled monolayers Self- assembled monolayers (SAM) are an extremely versatile approach that allows for precise control of surface characteristics. It was introduced in 1946 by Bigelow et al.,Nuzzo, R. G.; Allara, D. L. Adsorption of bifunctional organic disulfides on gold surfaces J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105, 4481-4483. but it was not until 1983 that it attracted widespread interest, when the formation of SAMs of alkanethiolates on gold was reported by Allara et al. Self-assembly of monolayers can be achieved using several systems. The basis for self-assembly is the formation of a covalent bond between the surface and the molecule forming the layer; and this requirement can be fulfilled using a variety of chemical groups such as organosilanes at hydroxylated materials (glass, silicon, aluminium oxide, mica) and organosulfur-based compounds species at noble metals . While the latter system has been well characterized, much less is known about the behavior of organosilane layers on surfaces and the underlying mechanisms that control monolayer organization and structure. Although silanization of silicate surfaces was introduced more than 40 years ago, the process of formation of smooth layers on surfaces is still poorly understood. Probably the most important reason for this situation is that a number of studies that have involved silanization as part of the procedure have not been concerned with thoroughly characterizing the silane layer formed. The one result that unifies recent studies on the characterization of silane layers is centered on the extreme sensitivity of the reactions that lead to the formation of silane layers. Indeed, self-assembled layers of silanes on silicate surfaces have been reported to be dependent on various parameters such as humidity, temperature, impurities in the silane reagent and the type of silicate surface. In order to consistently and reproducibly make diverse functionalized surfaces with layers that are molecularly smooth, it is critical to understand the chemistry of the silicate surfaces and the ways in which various parameters affect the nature of the self-assembled layers. Surface structure of silicon and mica Silicon Oxidized silicon has been extensively studied as a substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Piranha solution can be used to increase the surface density of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface of silicon. The ‚ÄìOH groups can hydrolyze and subsequently form siloxane linkages (Si-O-Si) with organic silane molecules. Preparation of silicon surfaces for silanization involves the removal of surface contaminants. This can be achieved by using UV-ozone and piranha solution. Piranha solution in particular constitutes quite a harsh treatment that can potentially damage the integrity of the silicon surface. Finlayson- Pitts et al. investigated the effect of certain treatments on silicon and concluded that both the roughness (3-5 √Ö) and the presence of scattered large particles were preserved after 1 cycle of plasma-treatment. However, the silicon surface was significantly damaged after 30 cycles of treatment with piranha solution or plasma. In both cases, treatment introduced irregularities and large aggregates on the surface (aggregate size > 80 nm), with the effect being more pronounced when piranha was used. In either case, multiple treatments rendered the surface inadequate for deposition of small biomolecules. Mica Mica is another silicate that is widely used as substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Mica bears a noticeable advantage over silicon because it is molecularly smooth and hence better suited for studies of small, flat molecules. It has a crystalline structure with generic formula K[Si3Al]O10Al2(OH)2 and contains sheets of octahedral hydroxyl-aluminum sandwiched between two silicon tetrahedral layers. In the silicon layer, one in four silicon atoms is replaced by an aluminum atom, generating a difference in charge that is offset by unbound K+ present in the region between neighboring silicon layers. Muscovite mica is most susceptible to cleavage along the plane located in the potassium layer. When a freshly cleaved mica surface is placed in contact with water, hydrated potassium ions can desorb from the mica surface, leading to a negative charge at the surface. Similar to silicon, the surface of mica does not contain an appreciable density of silanol groups for covalent attachment by silanes. A recent study reported that freshly cleaved mica carries 11% silanol groups (i.e., approximately 1 in 10 silicon atoms bears a hydroxyl group). Although it is possible that silanization may be carried out using untreated mica, the increased density of surface silanol groups on activated mica can significantly improve covalent attachment of silane molecules to the surface. Mica can be activated by treatment with argon/water plasma, leading to a silanol surface density of 30%. Working with activated surfaces introduces another consideration about the stability of the silanol groups on the activated surfaces. Giasson et al. reported that the silanol groups on freshly cleaved mica that was not subjected to any treatment were found to be more stable under high vacuum compared to the plasma-activated mica: after 64 hrs, surface coverage of the silanol groups for freshly cleaved mica plasma was roughly the same, while surface coverage for activated mica decreased 3-fold to 10%. Adsorption of molecules onto silicate surfaces Adsorption describes the process by which molecules or particles bind to surfaces and is distinguishable from absorption, whereby the particles spread in the bulk of the absorbing material. The adsorbed material is called the adsorbate, while the surface is called the adsorbent. It is common to distinguish between two types of adsorption, namely physical adsorption (which consists of intermolecular forces holding the adsorbed material to the surface) and chemical adsorption (which consists of covalent bonds tethering the adsorbed material to the surface). The nature of the layer of adsorbate formed depends on the interactions between the adsorbed material and the adsorbent.Parida, S. K.; Dash, S.; Patel, S.; Mishra, B. K. Adsorption of organic molecules on silica surface. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2006, 121, 77-110. More specifically, the mechanisms involved in adsorption include ion exchange (replacement of counter ions adsorbed from the solution by similarly charged ions), ion pairing (adsorption of ions from solution phase onto sites on the substrates that carry the opposite charge), hydrophobic bonding (non-polar attraction between groups on the substrate surface and molecules in solution), polarization of p-electrons polar interactions between partially charged sites on the substrate surface and molecules carrying opposite partial charges in solution, and covalent bonds.Paria, S.; Khilar, K. C. A review on experimental studies of surfactant adsorption at the hydrophilic solid-water interface. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004, 110, 75-95. The variety of ways for adsorption to occur provides an indication of the complexities associated with controlling the type of layer that is adsorbed. The type of silane used can further compound the problem, as in the case of APTES. APTES is the classical molecule used for the immobilization of biomolecules and has historically been the most widely studied molecule in the field by far. Since APTES contains three ethoxy groups per molecule, it can polymerize in the presence of water, leading to lateral polymerization between APTES molecules in horizontal and vertical directions and the formation of oligomers and polymers which can attach to the surface. Self-assembly can be approached using solution-phase reactions or vapor-phase reactions. In solution-phase experiments, the silane is dissolved in an anhydrous solvent and placed in contact with the surface; in vapor-phase experiments, only the vapor of the silane reaches the substrate surface. Solution-phase reactions Solution-phase reaction has historically been the method that has been most studied, and a general consensus that has evolved with regards to the conditions required for the formation of smooth aminosilane films includes the following: (1) an anhydrous solvent such as toluene is required, with a rigidly controlled trace amount of water to regulate the degree of polymerization of aminosilanes at the surface and in solution; (2) formation of oligomers and polymers is favored at higher silane concentrations (>10%); (3) moderate temperatures (60‚Äì90 ¬∞C) can disrupt non- covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, leading to fewer silane molecules that are weakly tethered to the surface. Additionally, condition (3) favors desorption of water from the substrate into the toluene phase20; (4) Rinsing with solvents such as toluene, ethanol and water following the silanization reaction favors the removal of weakly bonded silane molecules and the hydrolysis of residual alkoxy linkages in the layer; (5) drying and curing at high temperature (110 ¬∞C) favors the formation of siloxane linkages and also converts ammonium ions to the neutral amine, which is more reactive. Vapor-phase reactions Vapor-phase silanization has been approached as a way to circumvent the complexities of trace water in solution and silane purity. Since oligomers and polymers of silanes have negligible vapor pressure at the reaction temperatures commonly used, they do not reach the surface of the silicate during deposition. Since there is no solvent in the system, it is easier to control the amount of water in the reaction. Smooth monolayers have been reported for vapor-phase silanizations of several types of silanes, including aminosilanes, octadecyltrimethoxysilane and fluoalkyl silanes. However, the nature of the attachment of the silane molecules to the substrate is uncertain, although siloxane bond formation can be favored by soaking the substrate in water following deposition. In a recent study by Chen et al., APTES monolayers were obtained consistently at different temperatures and deposition times. The thicknesses of the layers obtained were 5 √Ö and 6 √Ö at 70 ¬∞C and 90 ¬∞C respectively, which corresponds to the approximate length of an APTES molecule and indicates that monolayers formed on the substrates in each case.

Mission  CSO‚Äôs mission is to anticipate, prevent, and respond to conflict that undermines U.S. national interests. The bureau implements this mission in two complementary ways: through data-driven analysis and forward deploying stabilization advisors to conflict zones. The objective is to inform and execute U.S. strategy, policy, and programs on conflict prevention and stabilization.  Overview  CSO‚Äôs expertise focuses on three key lines of effort: 1) political instability; 2) security sector stabilization; and 3) countering violent extremism (CVE). CSO collaborates with regional and functional bureaus, DOD, and USAID, and details stabilization advisors to posts and Geographic Combatant Commands (COCOMS) requiring specialized expertise.  Core Lines of Effort  CSO focuses on three core lines of effort: Political Instability. CSO maps country conditions, analyzes local dynamics, assesses risks/threats, and forecasts future zones of instability. An essential tool is the Instability Monitoring and Analysis Platform (IMAP), which collects, analyzes and visualizes data on political instability and conflict trends around the globe. CSO also supports local partners in implementing stabilization programs. CSO‚Äôs work has contributed to peace-process negotiations, mitigating election violence, sanctions assessments, and policy decisions. Security Sector Stabilization. The proliferation of militia and breakdown of national armies remains a key impediment to stabilizing fragile and failed states. CSO helps stabilize security sectors by identifying, mapping, and analyzing militia influence, and supporting disarmament demobilization, and reintegration programs. These efforts inform policies on detention, prosecution, or rehabilitation. Countering Violent Extremism (CVE). These efforts aim to reduce the recruitment and radicalization of violent extremists in areas of critical U.S. national interest. CSO collaborates with the Office of Counter Terrorism to provide research, analysis, and monitoring and evaluation of regional programs. CSO identifies at-risk individuals, vulnerable communities, and CVE influencers.  History  The Department of State announced the creation of the bureau on November 22, 2011, replacing the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization.

Due to the unusual manner in which she committed the murder, Larissa's case made national headlines. She has been dubbed \\"the Acid Lady\\" by various media outlets. For a period she was housed at Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, California. Currently she is incarcerated in Central California Women's Facility. Early life Larissa Foreman was born on January 1, 1960 and grew up on a farm in Clarence, Missouri. She went on to attend the University of Missouri studying biochemistry. While working at a nursing home, Larissa met Timothy Schuster, who was attending nursing school. In 1982, the couple married. They had a daughter, Kristin, in 1985, followed by a son, Tyler, in 1990. In 1989, the family moved west to Fresno, California, where Larissa took a job at an agricultural research lab. She later went on to open her own laboratory, Central California Research Labs. The family was able to move to a larger home in Clovis, California in 2000. By 2001, she was earning twice Tim's annual salary. Divorce By 2001, the Schuster marriage had deteriorated. In February 2002, Larissa filed for divorce, which would prove to be acrimonious. Larissa and Tim fought over custody of their son Tyler and the splitting of their joint assets. Larissa was eventually awarded primary custody of Tyler and was allowed to stay in the couple's house. Tim moved out into a condominium, but in August 2002, Larissa and her lab assistant James Fagone broke into Tim's home to retrieve some of her belongings. Larissa reportedly stated to her friend, Terri Lopez: \\"Well, I want [my husband] dead. You don't understand. I could do it and get away with it.\\" Disappearance On the morning of July 10, 2003, Tim Schuster was supposed to meet with a co-worker for breakfast, but had apparently missed the appointment. Later that day, he was supposed to retrieve his son from Larissa, but he never showed up. Larissa immediately became the prime suspect in her estranged husband's disappearance. She was initially interviewed by the Clovis Police Department, but was not charged. Despite her husband being missing, Larissa and her son took a planned vacation to Disney World and then to Missouri. In the meantime, police interviewed Larissa's co-worker James Fagone, who was more forthcoming in his interrogation. Murder During his police interrogation, James Fagone revealed that he and Larissa Schuster were responsible for the disappearance and murder of Timothy Schuster. James admitted that on the night of July 9, 2003, he and Larissa lured Tim from his home. The pair then used chloroform and a stun gun to incapacitate Tim, then disposed of his unconscious body in a 55-gallon barrel, and attempted to dissolve his body with hydrochloric acid. With a search warrant, police searched Larissa Schuster's storage unit where they found the barrel with the liquefied remains of her husband. Larissa Schuster was arrested for first-degree murder at the St. Louis Airport. Trial of James Fagone James Fagone, who had also been charged with first- degree murder as well as kidnapping, went to trial in November 2006. His defense was that Larissa Schuster was the mastermind of Timothy Schuster's murder, and that he only acted as an accessory to murder after the fact under duress, maintaining that Larissa had threatened his life. Defense testimony came from James' friends, co-workers, and Larissa's friend Terri Lopez, all of whom stated that Larissa was a very controlling and forceful person. However, James had already confessed to the crime, which he had unsuccessfully tried to recant. Jurors were shown the video of James' police interrogation, where he is shown saying: \\"I held the barrel for her, put him in, poured all the solution and she like couldn't stand it. So she said, put it on, the lid on. So I helped her put the lid on and she put it in the shed.\\" Although James Fagone was acquitted of kidnapping, he was found guilty of first-degree murder, and despite jurors' pleas for leniency, he was sentenced to life without parole. Trial of Larissa Schuster Larissa Schuster's murder trial began on October 22, 2007, more than four years after she was charged. Her trial had to be moved from Clovis, California to Los Angeles due to the pre- trial publicity. She had been dubbed the \\"Acid Lady\\" by various media outlets in Fresno. Prosecutors had alleged to the jury that Larissa Schuster had attempted to solicit Tim's murder before, believing that she could get away with it. They also played graphic and berating phone messages from Larissa that Tim had saved on his answering machine. Prosecutors also stated how Larissa had access to all the chemicals used in the murder, being that she was a biochemist in a research lab. Although her accomplice, James Fagone, did not testify in Larissa's trial, Larissa decided to take the witness stand in her own defense. Her attorney admitted that she had made a series of bad decisions, but that she was not guilty of the crime alleged against her. On the stand, Larissa testified how she had no foreknowledge of the murder and that James Fagone was actually Tim Schuster's killer. She stated that James had told her: \\"I heard him say something like 'there had been an accident and Tim is dead.' I thought he was joking.\\" She did however, admit to moving Tim's body. When confronted over the phone messages on Tim's answering machine, Larissa replied with: \\"It is something I'm really ashamed about. You have to realize that is something... a result of many accumulative things.\\" She also maintained that the reason for the large amounts of chemicals at her laboratory were not to be used for the murder of Timothy Schuster, but for a wholesale cleaning of the items at the lab. Her testimony proved to have not swayed the jury; she was found guilty of first-degree murder with the special circumstance of financial gain. On May 16, 2008 Larissa Schuster was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Aftermath Due to the special circumstance finding, Larissa Schuster was mandatorily sentenced to life without parole on May 16, 2008. At her sentencing hearing, her daughter Kristin gave a victim's impact statement: \\"You've given up all rights as a mother, wife, daughter, friend and woman. You're a disgrace to this family ‚Äì a pitiful excuse for a human. I pray you're continually haunted at night by the sight and sound of my father fighting for his last breathing moments on this earth. I hope you toss and turn and have horrible nightmares visualizing the horrific act of violence you have committed.\\" For a period Schuster served her sentence at the Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, California, while James Fagone is serving his sentence at the Calipatria State Prison in Calipatria, California. In February 2011, Larissa's murder conviction was affirmed by the Fifth District of the California Court of Appeal. The murder of Timothy Schuster was featured on Snapped and Dateline NBC in 2009, Deadly Women in 2011, Sins and Secrets in 2012, Deadly Wives in 2013, How (Not) to Kill Your Husband in 2014, It Takes A Killer in 2016, and Killer Mysteries in 2019.

Return on event (ROE) is a term used in event marketing, compared to rate of return ROR, also known as return on investment ROI, which is the ratio of money gained or lost on an investment. The initial value of an investment does not always have a clearly defined monetary value. In event marketing the purpose of an event can be awareness of a new product, trials, brand commitment, brand building, or combinations of these. Similarly, the final value of an investment does not always have a clearly defined monetary value, but can add value to a brand instead of contributing to sales volume. Calculating your return on event (ROE): #Collect the number of people who has been directly in contact with your event (received a sample, recorded a song, had a picture taken etc. etc.) #The amount of money invested by the client #Collect the number of people who have been indirectly in contact with your event (bystanders, people who have passed and seen the event) #Calculate your ‚Äúprice pr. contact‚Äù (separate for direct and indirect contacts) by dividing number of contacts by amount of money invested #Record video footage or observe over a period of time, to analyze an estimate of the time period that people dwell at your event to find your dwell time. Besides the clearly defined value above, an event can for example contribute in social media by gaining ‚Äúlikes‚Äù or followers on Facebook, Twitter, and similar, connecting to the existing ‚Äúfans‚Äù and or followers on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Return on event is also a valuable tool in the sales phase, and should be implemented before the event, to set goals and guidelines for the event. Event marketing companies can use return on event to analyze and present to the client, facts, estimated contacts, contact price etc., before the proposed event. Return on event after the event will be clearly defined, and can be used by the client to show the impact of the event.

After fighting in the American Revolutionary War, he began to believe that his service and labor meant little to those in charge. He soon became a member of the Jeffersonian Republican Party (otherwise known as the Democratic- Republican Party) in response to the day‚Äôs ruling Federalist Party. As the years passed and his distrust in government grew, he wrote multiple papers on what he deemed was the corruptness of the \\"Few\\" and what the \\"Many\\" endured because of it. In 1798, Manning wrote his most famous work, The Key of Libberty (later corrected to The Key of Liberty), in which he wrote that the goal of the Few was to distress and force the Many into financially depending on them, creating a continued cycle of dependence. He continued that the Many‚Äôs only hope was to vote for leaders that would fight for those with lesser power and urge for smaller government. His work, however, would not be published for more than a century, mostly due to its controversial content.  Early life  William Manning was born in Billerica, MA, in 1747. His paternal ancestors came to Massachusetts from England during the Puritan migration. The farm he was born on was the same farm that his great-grandfather worked on and lived.Morison, Samuel E., and William Manning. \\"William Manning‚Äôs The Key of Libberty.\\" The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, 13.2 (1956): 202. JSTOR. Web. 13 Nov. 2011. On that farm, built in 1696 and referred to as the Old Manse, Manning and his wife, Sarah, raised 10 of their 13 children. Manning lived a life of \\"Yankee yeomanry\\"‚Äîa group of small, free holding farmers‚Äîlike his ancestors and lived in a village named Hampden that was well off. The farm, itself, was formerly used as a garrison house during the Indian wars and, afterwards, served as a tavern. Many of the original books from the tavern are still in existence.Morison and Manning 202.  Military career  Little is known of Manning‚Äôs military career, other than the fact that it inspired him to write his later works. On April 19, 1775, while serving in Captain Solomon Pollard‚Äôs company at age 27, he responded too late to the alarm of the Battle of Lexington and Concord in the American Revolutionary War.Morison and Manning 203. He was appointed second lieutenant shortly afterwards and served two terms as a selectman in Billerica many years later.Morison and Manning 203.  Budding Philosophy: \\"The Few and the Many\\"  During the war, Manning took up the ideas of liberty and free government, meant to prevent tyranny of the majority. He said after watching the first blood shed at Concord and witnessing men die for liberty, a permanent scar formed on his mind.Morison and Manning 211; Newton, Ron. \\"Rediscovering ‚ÄòThe Key of Libberty‚Äô and the Hand That Turns It.\\" RonNewton.com. Web. 13 Nov. 2011, par. 4. At first, he found it impossible to accept a free government and to write his ideas on it‚Äîthinking that tyranny would never happen‚Äîuntil the signing of Jay‚Äôs Treaty of 1794, proposed by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Jay. He was sent to England to seek solutions during the crumbling relationship of Britain and America following the war.\\"Jay's Treaty.\\" U-S- History.com. Web. 13 Nov. 2011, pars. 1-2. As a result, the treaty included: a) a withdrawal of British soldiers from posts in the American West, b) a commission to settle border issues between America and Canada, and c) a commission to resolve the American losses in British ship seizures and Loyalist losses during the Revolutionary War. It did not, however, demand that the British stop arresting American ships and seamen.\\"Jay's Treaty,\\" pars. 2-4. It was backed by Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist, signed under the pen name Camillus in November 1794. Though it met much criticism, President George Washington pushed for its ratification and Jay's Treaty passed the Senate in June 1795.\\"Jay‚Äôs Treaty.\\" EarlyAmerica.com. Web. 13 Nov. 2011, par. 5. Manning referred to Jay's Treaty as \\"the monster,\\"Mercieca, Jennifer R., and James Arnt Aune. \\"A Vernacular Republican Rhetoric: William Manning's Key Of Libberty.\\" Quarterly Journal of Speech 91.2 (2005): 120. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Dec. 2011. noting that Jay and his supporters did not care if American seamen, one of the lowest ranks in the Navy, did not receive justice for being arrested and tortured by the British. He, a former soldier, naturally felt sympathy for his fellow servicemen and acknowledged that the elite's treatment of the seamen must be similar to their treatment of other American citizens of lesser status. As Jennifer R. Mercieca and James Arnt Aune noted in their article \\"A Vernacular Republican Rhetoric: William Manning's Key of Libberty,\\" historian Thomas Gustafson would refer to Jay's Treaty as one of the great controversies of the 1790s and as part of a \\"Thucydidean moment,\\" a point \\"where a republic confronts the reality that political and linguistic disorders are the same.\\"Mercieca and Aune 121. This was Manning's reality. The treaty indignantly stirred Manning's political and moral feelings and encouraged him to write, but it was not his sole source of content. His writings also incorporated opposition to leading politicians and policies of his day. He despised Hamilton‚Äôs financial plan following the Revolutionary War, of which the federal government would assume the war debts of the states, creating a cycle of financial dependence on the federal government while encouraging creditors to preserve it. Hamilton also proposed a national bank, solidifying the government‚Äôs power and creating a strong national credit.Morison and Manning 203 and 243-44. Manning also despised Washington‚Äôs foreign policy, of which he controlled treaty negotiations with hostile power‚Äîespecially that of the Native Americans‚Äîand asked for congressional approval afterwards. He also sent American missionaries overseas for negotiations without legislative approval\\"American President: A Reference Resource.\\" MillerCenter.org. Web. 13 Nov. 2011, par. 1. and pretended, in Manning's opinion, to cater to the needs of non-elite and working citizens, the majority, by promoting free trade and increasing demand during America‚Äôs involvement in European wars.Morison and Manning 203 and 244-45. However, Manning would come to believe that in many treaties of the day, including Jay‚Äôs Treaty, that the rights of everyday citizens were not of importance.Morison and Manning 203 and 244-45. He believed each of those policies enabled the government to become too big and its people too small. Using his Jeffersonian Republican beliefs as a basis (though Thomas Jefferson would not become president until 1801), Manning believed that any policies that reflected Hamilton, Washington or Jay‚Äôs policies created the poisonous atmosphere and ideology of the \\"Few and the Many.\\" Manning distinguished the Few as the small group of elite, rich and powerful men that held the fate of the country in their hands and the Many, including himself, as those facing economic and educational setbacks, not being able to have their voices heard due to their limited circumstances.Newton par. 5. This became Manning‚Äôs emphasis throughout most of his works.  The Key of Liberty  In 1798, 15 years after the end of the Revolutionary War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Manning wrote his most famous text, The Key of Liberty. In it, he further defined the distinction between the Few and the Many. The Few, according to him, did not produce labor, and their incomes relied primarily on interests, rents, salaries and fees fixed on the nominal value of money. He also said that they preferred money to be scarce and labor to be produced at as low of a cost as possible.Morison and Manning 219. Manning wrote in his text, \\"For instance if the prices of labour & produce should fall one halfe if would be just the same to the few as if their rents fees & salleryes ware doubled, all which they would git out of the many.\\"Morison and Manning 219. On the other hand, Manning continued, if the Many doubled the prices of labor and produce, they would pay off their debts and enjoy not being financially dependent on the Few.Morison and Manning 219. Some of the biggest threats to the Many, however, were people working in the judicial and executive branches of federal government, especially lawyers. He said that they were continuously interested in having money scarce and their people in distress. The scarcer the money, they believed, the lower the cost of produce and the more distressed the people became, the better.Morison and Manning 219. It, therefore, not only doubled the nominal value of their fees and salaries, Manning said, but also doubled and tripled their income, forcing the people to beg for forgiveness, patience and forbearance.Morison and Manning 219. Manning wrote, \\"This gratifyes both their pride & covetousness, when on the other hand when money is plenty & prices high they have little or nothing to do. This is the Reason why they aught to be kept intirely from the Legislative Body....\\"Morison and Manning 219-20. In Manning‚Äôs earlier text, an article titled \\"Some Proposals,\\" of which he harped on his loathing of Hamilton‚Äôs financial policy, he merely explained the difference between the Few and the Many as a fight over monetary policy, whereas in Libberty, he explained it as disputes between labor, property and free government.Merrill, Michael, Sean Wilentz and William Manning. The Key of Liberty: The Life and Democratic Writings of William Manning, \\"A Laborer,\\" 1747-1814. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993, p. 59. Throughout the text, Manning also explained that the Many feared that the Few would form an elite society backed by a federalist government that would shun the Jeffersonian Republican Party and its ideas.Morison and Manning 203 and 222-23; Newton par. 5. He encouraged the Many to not trust the government with their best interests and to elect officials that supported limited government.Morison and Manning 222-23; Newton pars. 10-11. Though the identification and tensions of the Few and the Many were Manning‚Äôs main points in the text, he also dedicated time to explaining key events leading to the need of such explanations. One of the events was Shays‚Äô Rebellion, or \\"On the Shais Affair in Maschusets\\" as noted in the text.Morison and Manning 242-243. Cycles of depression and indulgence followed the Revolutionary War, only to be exacerbated by Massachusetts‚Äô regulation of money and debt while British creditors called in their debts from the war. Merchants turned to farmers and rural traders that could not afford to pay their debts and, in turn, put them in prison.\\"William Manning, ‚ÄòA Laborer,‚Äô Explains Shay‚Äôs Rebellion in Massachusetts.\\" HistoryMatters.GMU.edu. Web. 13 Nov. 2011, par. 1. Daniel Shays, a former leader of the revolutionary militia, responded by leading an uprising in Western Massachusetts, closing the courts and preventing seizure of property.\\"William Manning, ‚ÄòA Laborer,‚Äô Explains Shay‚Äôs Rebellion in Massachusetts,\\" par. 1. Massachusetts Governor James Bowdoin later ordered military forces to scatter the rebels.\\"William Manning, ‚ÄòA Laborer,‚Äô Explains Shay‚Äôs Rebellion in Massachusetts,\\" par. 1. By living in close proximity, Manning gave an eye-witness account of the experience and asked the Many to form organized groups of labor and interests to prevent such happenings in the future.Morison and Manning 242-43. Forming such groups, in addition to voting for representatives that would fight for smaller government and the rights of the Many, is what Manning referred to as the ultimate key of libberty.  Political Atmosphere following Liberty  Manning‚Äôs many attempts to publish The Key of Libberty failed. He originally sent a copy of Libberty to the Independent Chronicle, but Republicans at that paper refused to publish it because its remedy of an organized group of laborers possibly publishing their own monthly magazine would put many Republicans out of work.Morison and Manning 204 and 247-51. Anyone who published anything against President John Adams, a Federalist, and/or the war faced imprisonment, including Thomas Adams (of no relation to the president), editor of the Chronicle, and Abijah Adams, his brother and clerk.Morison and Manning 205. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 were in effect and Jeffersonian Republicans were deemed traitors, causing his work to take a back seat. Manning would regain confidence after Thomas Jefferson, a supporter of smaller government, defeated Adams in the election of 1800. His beliefs and actions as president, however, were often overshadowed by Adams‚Äô eleventh hour appointment of John C. Marshall, a Federalist, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. His rulings often mirrored the beliefs of the once-ruling party.Newton par. 12.  Death  On October 21, 1814, shortly before the Hartford Convention, of which the Federalist Party would ultimately meet its demise, William Manning died of an unknown cause on his farm in Hampden. He was survived by his widow, several married children and his unmarried children‚ÄîWilliam, Jephthah, Sarah, Lucretia, Luna, Roxa, Lucinda and Jerusha.Morison and Manning 206. They maintained the farm until 1857, when the last survivor moved away.Morison and Manning 206.  Posthumous Work and Modern Comparisons  The Key of Libberty would not be published until 1922 with a foreword by Harvard University historian Samuel Eliot Morison, in which he said, \\"It used to be said of him by his friends that if William Manning drowned, they would seek his body up-stream, for he would surely not float down with the current like other people.\\"Morison and Manning 204. His ideas are mirrored in the ongoing Tea Party Movement, of which its members believe that the government is made of an elite group of people, the Few, which do not cater to its citizens, the Many, and distrust the government because of it. They have taken it upon themselves to form organized groups based on their own interests. Manning‚Äôs ideas are also mirrored in the ongoing international Occupy Movement, stemming from the original Occupy Wall Street Movement in New York. Its participants believe that the wealthiest citizens of the country, the Few, represent the 1% of the population that can force their influence on financial and legislative policies while the rest, the Many (of which they belong), represent the 99% of the population that are hindered by the policies that the Few make and/or support. This group is highly active and adamant in their beliefs and often camp outside of government and corporate buildings across the world, proclaiming that they will protest uninterruptedly until the government changes.

The company's Xtreme Range (XR) cards operated on non-standard IEEE 802.11 bands, which reduced the impact of congestion in the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands. In August 2007 a group of Italian amateur radio operators set a distance world record for point-to-point links in the 5.8 GHz spectrum. Using two XR5 cards and a pair of 35 dBi dish antennas, the Italian team was able to establish a 304 km (about 188 mi) link at data rates between 4 and 5 Mbit/s.

Redistricting normally follows the completion of the United States Census, which is carried out by the federal government in years that end in 0; the most recent Census took place in 2010. Historically, Arizona's legislature has had control over the redistricting process. However, Proposition 106, passed in 2000, delegated the power to draw congressional and legislative boundaries to a bipartisan independent commission. The Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC) comprises two Democrats, two Republicans, and one independent chair. County and local redistricting, which normally takes place along the same timeline as congressional and legislative redistricting, is carried out by the individual county and local governments rather than the AIRC.  Background  Reapportionment of representatives between the states every ten years based on new census figures is required by Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Constitution, Supreme Court jurisprudence and federal law allow significant latitude to the individual states to draw their congressional and legislative districts as they see fit, as long as each district contains roughly equivalent numbers of people (see Baker v. Carr, Wesberry v. Sanders, and Reynolds v. Sims) and provides for minority representation pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. While control over redrawing district lines has been in the hands of state legislators for most of American history, a number of states, including Arizona, have adopted independent or bipartisan commissions for redistricting purposes in the last twenty years. The entire state of Arizona was a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, meaning that any change in voting requirements or procedures must be approved by either the U.S. Department of Justice or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before taking effect. At the end of the redistricting process, the state had to submit its maps and demonstrate \\"that the proposed voting change does not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group,\\" the latter primarily referring to, in the case of Arizona, non-Anglophone Hispanics. The formula for Section 5 was struck down by the United States Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. ___ (2013). Additionally, the proposed boundaries may not have a retrogressive effect on the ability of minority groups to elect \\"their preferred candidates of choice.\\"  History  For most of Arizona's history--that is, the period between statehood in 1912 and the passage of Proposition 106 in 2000--the legislature controlled the drawing of congressional and legislative districts. Until 1941, however, there was no congressional redistricting to be done, as Arizona only had a single at-large seat. The Census of 1940 showed that Arizona's population had grown significantly enough to merit a second seat in the House of Representatives; in the 1942 midterm elections, Arizona sent two representatives to Congress for the first time. The state gained one seat after each of the censuses in 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990; following explosive population growth in the nineties, the state added two congressional districts. Arizona's rapid growth since the 1960s is largely the result of sustained internal migration from the Northeast and Midwest to the Sun Belt, as well as steady legal and illegal immigration. For most of Arizona's history, politics at the state and federal level has been reliably Republican; the only Democratic presidential nominees to carry Arizona since the end of World War II have been Harry Truman in 1948 and Bill Clinton in 1996. However, the Hispanic population has risen by 46% in the last ten years. Due to this influx, Arizona has become more competitive politically and despite the history of the state, President Obama‚Äôs 2012 reelection campaign manager stated he believed Obama could win the state. The AIRC was created when voters approved Proposition 106 in 2000, 56.1 percent to 43.9 percent. Proposition 106 amended the Arizona Constitution to create a bipartisan commission independent of the state legislature that would be tasked with redrawing congressional and legislative lines following the decennial census. The commission's mandate is to draw districts considering six factors and explicitly omitting from consideration a seventh factor. The six criteria the commission attempts to satisfy, in descending order of importance, are: #that they are in compliance with the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, #that districts are roughly equal in population, #that they appear compact and contiguous, #that they respect communities of interest, #that they incorporate visible geographic features; city, town, and county boundaries; and undivided census tracts; #and that they are electorally competitive as long as the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Article 4 Part 2 Section 1 of the state Constitution prevents commissioners from considering incumbency or candidacy when drawing districts: \\"The places of residence of incumbents or candidates shall not be identified or considered.\\" While most of Arizona's House delegation opposed Proposition 106, a number of important officials, including then-Arizona Attorney General and future Governor and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, supported it.  Membership  The Arizona Constitution mandates that \\"by February 28 of each year that ends in one, an independent redistricting commission shall be established to provide for the redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts.\\" The state Commission on Appellate Court Appointments solicits and reviews applications from the public and nominates 25 candidates‚Äîten Democrats, ten Republicans and five independents. The Constitution also specifies that \\"within the three years previous to appointment, members shall not have been appointed to, elected to, or a candidate for any other public office, including precinct committeeman or committeewoman but not including school board member or officer, and shall not have served as an officer of a political party, or served as a registered paid lobbyist or as an officer of a candidate's campaign committee.\\" The leaders of the two largest parties in both houses of the legislature (in practice, the Senate and House Democratic and Republican leaders) select one candidate each to be commissioners. Of the four commissioners selected by the legislature, no more than two may be from the same party or from the same county. Once the four partisan commissioners are set, they then select an independent chair from the list of candidates compiled by the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments. This fifth member is not subject to the county residency limit otherwise imposed, so in practice up to three members of the AIRC may be from a single county. Once the membership of the commission is determined, several months of administrative and educational meetings and sessions follow. Actual map work and public fora usually begin in the late summer. Article 4 Part 2 Section 1 of the Constitution grants Arizona's governor the power to remove any member of the commission \\"with the concurrence of two-thirds of the senate, for substantial neglect of duty, gross misconduct in office, or inability to discharge the duties of office.\\" Arizona governor, Jan Brewer, became the first to exercise this prerogative when, on November 1, 2011 the Arizona Senate approved her removal of AIRC chairwoman Colleen Mathis by a party-line vote of 21-6. The Arizona Supreme Court, however, unanimously ruled Mathis's removal unconstitutional on November 17 and ordered her reinstatement as AIRC chairwoman. ;Current commissioners Commissioners as of October 2011: *Colleen Mathis, independent of Pima County (chairman) *Linda McNulty, Democrat of Pima County *Jose Herrera, Democrat of Maricopa County *Scott Freeman, Republican of Maricopa County *Richard Stertz, Republican of Pima County ;Past commissioners Past commissioners as of October 2011: *Steven W. Lynn, independent (chairman) *Daniel Elder, Republican *Joshua Hall, Democrat *James Huntwork, Republican *Andi Minkoff, Democrat 2010 redistricting Between 2000 and 2010 Arizona's population grew by 1,261,385 people, from 5,130,632 to 6,392,017, a 24.6 percent increase. This represented the second highest population growth rate in the country after Nevada and far outpaced the national average, resulting in Arizona gaining a ninth congressional seat through reapportionment. The AIRC for the 2011-2020 cycle started administrative meetings in March 2011 and held its first official mapping meeting on August 18, 2011. Through the spring and summer, the committee held meetings and public fora around the state to solicit public input. The AIRC approved draft congressional and draft legislative maps on October 3 and October 10 respectively and has completed two rounds of hearings gauging Arizonans' reactions to the draft maps. Population growth over the first decade of the century was concentrated in the exurbs of Phoenix. To Maricopa County's southeast, Pinal County, once sparsely populated, grew by 100 percent, to 375,770. Communities to the west of the capital also expanded substantially. Demographically, \\"the Hispanic population grew by 46 percent statewide over the last decade - more than twice the growth of all other ethnic groups.\\" The draft congressional map, which was approved by the commission by a vote of 3-1 with one abstention, was seen by outside observers as generally favorable to Democrats; neither Republican member voted in favor of it. Several Democratic incumbents, including Raul Grijalva and Gabrielle Giffords, were drawn into slightly more Democratic districts. Additionally, the 9th district, based in Tempe and comprising much of the old 5th district, would be competitive and possibly Democratic-leaning, having voted for John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008. Two freshman representatives, Paul Gosar and Ben Quayle, faced the choice of running in much less Republican districts or moving to safer districts where they could potentially face competitive primaries. Maricopa County would continue to dominate the state's politics under the new map: eight of Arizona's nine congressional districts extend into its more than 3.8 million-person territory. In an unprecedented vote on November 1, 2011, the Arizona Senate approved Governor Jan Brewer's removal of the AIRC's independent chairwoman, Colleen Mathis, under allegations of gross misconduct. On November 17, the Arizona Supreme Court summarily and unanimously overturned Governor Brewer's removal of Mathis, ordering her reinstatement as commission chair. Mathis, who denied all wrongdoing, attempted to have the Arizona Supreme Court stop the Senate from voting to remove her, but the vote took place before the case could go forward. Brewer also attempted to remove both Democratic members of the commission in the same motion, but the Senate declined to vote on those removals. Attorneys for Mathis and the AIRC brought suit to the state Supreme Court asking it \\"to rule the governor exceeded her legal authority in dismissing Mathis, and the Senate acted illegally in ratifying Brewer's decision.\\" While Brewer's office and Republicans in the Arizona legislature defended their actions as part of their constitutional prerogatives, Democrats and the authors of Proposition 106 contend Mathis's removal was politically motivated and not justified by any of the violations alleged by Republicans. In the following days, Arizona's two major newspapers, The Arizona Republic and Arizona Daily Star, penned editorials condemning the move, writing that though the allegations against Mathis merit investigation, they do not rise to the level of \\"gross misconduct.\\" The Star opined, \\"It appears that Mathis' real misdeed is putting out for public comment a map that the governor and fellow Republicans think is wrong.\\" On November 17, the Supreme Court ruled against the Brewer administration, finding that \\"the governor did not demonstrate substantial grounds for removing Mathis from the head of the redistricting panel.\\" The court ordered her reinstated as chairwoman of the AIRC. With the reinstatement of Chairman Mathis, the AIRC continued drawing and finalizing the maps. In an attempt to ensure that the process was fair and transparent, the commission held 58 business meetings and 43 public hearings in locations all over the state, for a total of over 359 hours in an 11-month period. There were a total of over 5,000 attendees at those meetings, and 2,350 speaking requests were granted. The commission streamed almost every meeting to the internet, allowing another 1,850 distinct viewers to join. After these meetings and the continued deliberations of the committee, the AIRC submitted the final Congressional and Legislative Maps to the Department of Justice on February 9, 2012 and February 28, 2012 respectively for preclearance under the Voting Rights Act. The Justice Department approved the maps on April 9, 2012 and April 26, 2012 respectively.http://www.azredistricting.org/News-Releases/docs/CD-Approval.pdf Constitutionality The Elections Clause of the federal constitution provides, \\"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\\" (emphasis added). Because the independent redistricting commission was created by voters through ballot initiative rather than by the legislature, the constitutionality of congressional district maps drawn by the commission was under dispute. (All agree the commission has authority to draw state district maps.) The Arizona Legislature filed suit in federal court, seeking to take back the power to draw congressional district lines. The case eventually went before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Arizona Legislature was so confident that it would prevail in the U.S. Supreme Court that it even hired a firm to redraw the congressional district maps without waiting for the Court to make its decision.http://morningconsult.com/2015/06/arizona-republicans- planning-redistricting-push-after-scotus-decision/ On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the legislature's argument in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. The Court held the term \\"legislature\\" in the Elections Clause could be read broadly to mean \\"the power that makes laws,\\" not just the two representative houses. Because Arizona Constitution granted voters exactly \\"the power that makes laws,\\" the voters were not prohibited from adopting laws governing redistricting.Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 2015 The court's decision left intact the independent redistricting commission's full authority, and implicitly upheld similar commissions in other states, notably the California Citizens Redistricting Commission.

Zupanc in 2015 G√ºnther K.H. Zupanc (born 20 October 1958) is a neurobiologist, researcher, university teacher, book author, journal editor, and educational reformer. He is Professor in the Department of Biology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.  Education  G√ºnther Zupanc was born in Augsburg in (then) West-Germany. He graduated in Biology and Physics from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with degrees equivalent to Bachelor‚Äôs and master's degrees. He received his Ph.D. in Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego (1990), and he was awarded the habilitation (Dr. rer. nat. habil.) in Animal Physiology from the University of T√ºbingen (Germany) (1995).  Journalistic career  Before enrolling in college, Zupanc worked as a journalist for the M√ºnchner Merkur, a major daily newspaper in Munich, Germany, where he specialized in science writing. He also published numerous science articles in other newspapers and magazines. For one of his articles, he was awarded first prize in the contest Reporter der Wissenschaft as Germany‚Äôs best young science writer in 1980.  Academic career  G√ºnther Zupanc was Research Assistant and Research Scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California (1987‚Äì92), Junior Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T√ºbingen, Germany (1992‚Äì97), Senior Lecturer (equivalent to Associate Professor) at the University of Manchester, U.K. (1997‚Äì2002), and Professor at the International University Bremen (now Jacobs University Bremen) (2002‚Äì09). Since 2009 he has been Professor at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, where he also served as Chair of the Department of Biology (2009‚Äì12). Zupanc was Visiting Professor at the University of Ottawa, Canada (1994‚Äì97) and Visiting Scholar at the University of California, San Diego, the University of Chicago, the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Scripps Research Institute, Tufts University, and Jacobs University Bremen.  Research  Zupanc has made important contributions to several disciplines within biology, including neuroethology, neuroanatomy, neuroendocrinology, and developmental neurobiology. In his early work, he showed that seasonal changes in specific behavioral patterns are paralleled by pronounced alterations in the structure of brain neurons that control these behaviors. His laboratory has extensively studied the behavior of weakly electric fish. Among others, these investigations led to the discovery of a novel behavioral pattern, the 'echo response'. As part of his efforts to establish the brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) as a powerful model organisms for the study of behavior and neural plasticity, his laboratory performed (in collaboration with the group of Jeffrey N. Agar of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Northeastern University) a de novo assembly, annotation, and proteomics validation of the central nervous system transcriptome of this species. Using the electric organ discharge of weakly electric fish as a neuroethological model system, Zupanc and his team were the first to employ a proteomics approach for large-scale identification of proteins involved in the development of a sexual dimorphism in behavior. The results of this research have implications beyond this study, suggesting that astrocytes play an important role in the regulation of the activity of neural oscillators, including those that control a sexually dimorphic behavior. In the field of neuroendocrinology, Zupanc and his collaborators succeeded in the cloning and pharmacological characterization of the first non-mammalian somatostatin neuropeptide receptor. His laboratory developed a novel in vitro technique to trace neural connections in the brain. This approach led to the discovery of numerous previously unknown connections in the brain of teleost fish. Since the early 1990s, Zupanc‚Äôs research group has pioneered the study of adult neurogenesis (the generation of new neurons in the adult central nervous system) in teleosts. He and his wife Marianne M. Zupanc introduced labeling of mitotic cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to research on adult neurogenesis. Since then, this method has been used by numerous investigators working in this area. His research group performed the first complete mapping of proliferation zones in the adult brain of any vertebrate species (1995), and he and his associates introduced zebrafish (2005) and tilapia (2012) as model systems to study adult neurogenesis. To provide an explanation for the biological function of adult neurogenesis, he formulated the 'matching hypothesis.' According to this hypothesis, neurogenesis in the adult central nervous system is the result of the continuous generation of new muscle fibers and sensory receptor cells in the periphery. To maintain a constant ratio between the peripheral motor and sensory elements on the one side, and the central elements on the other, any numerical change in the periphery prompts a corresponding numerical alteration (production or loss of neurons) in the central nervous system. He and his team also demonstrated that the continued generation of new neurons in the adult central nervous system of teleost fish is closely linked to the enormous potential of this taxon to regenerate nervous tissue and to recover behavioral function after brain lesions and spinal cord injury. By employing a proteomics approach, Zupanc and his associates performed the first large-scale analysis in teleost fish of changes in global protein expression after brain trauma. As part of this effort, the team succeeded in the identification of a large number of proteins potentially involved in the regeneration of nervous tissue. In an expansion of their research on adult neurogenesis, the laboratory of Zupanc discovered the first vertebrate organism that lacks any of the hallmarks of brain senescence common to humans and all mammalian species examined thus far. In contrast to the latter, brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) do not exhibit any significant age-related decline in stem/progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal and glial differentiation, or long-term survival of newly generated cells. The availability of this first vertebrate model of ‚Äònegligible senescence‚Äô provides unprecedented opportunities for a better understanding of the biology of aging and of the cellular mechanisms that protect brains from senescing. As the first investigator in the field of adult neurogenesis, Zupanc and his laboratory succeeded in generating three-dimensional, high- resolution maps of adult stem cells and their progeny, as well as molecular profiles of these cells, in the spinal cord. This work led to the development of a novel mapping approach (‚Äòstatistical mapping‚Äô), which enables researchers to produce global maps of central nervous system structures with cellular resolution. By integrating the big data set collected through such experimental work, Zupanc and his collaborators Iulian Ilie≈ü and Rifat Sipahi (Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University) succeeded in building the first mathematical model of tissue growth in the spinal cord. This model provides an important theoretical framework for better understanding tissue growth in the intact and the regenerating central nervous system. In collaboration with Rifat Sipahi, Zupanc also constructed computational models that simulate normal and tumorous tissue growth in vitro. Using this approach, the team has provided a theoretical explanation for the seemingly paradoxical effect that in lymphoma and prostate cancer cell-death- inducing chemotherapy sometimes induces tumors, instead of suppressing them. A characteristic feature of the research of G√ºnther Zupanc is the application of a multidisciplinary approach ‚Äî the techniques and concepts used in his investigations are taken from a wide range of disciplines, including molecular biology, cell biology, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, computational neurosciences, behavioral neurobiology, analytical chemistry, biophysics, and mathematical modeling.  Editor of journals  Behavioral Neurobiology: An Integrative Approach, Third Edition Zupanc was Editor of the Journal of Zoology (2007‚Äì11), and he has been Editor of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A since 2008. He has also edited special issues of several scientific journals, including Adult Neurogenesis: A Comparative Approach for Brain, Behavior and Evolution, Electric Fish: Model Systems for Neurobiology and Integrative and Comparative Neurobiology: Papers in Memoriam of Theodore H.

In this form of exocytosis, the vesicle docks and transiently fuses at the presynaptic membrane and releases its neurotransmitters across the synapse, after which the vesicle can then be reused. Kiss-and-run differs from full fusion, where the vesicle collapses fully into the plasma membrane and is then later retrieved by a clathrin-coat- dependent process. The idea that neurotransmitter might be released in \\"quanta\\" by the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane was first introduced by Bernard Katz and Jose del Castillo in 1955, when the first EM images of nerve terminals first appeared. The possibility of transient fusion and rapid retrieval of vesicle membrane was proposed by Bruno Ceccarelli in 1973, after examining in the electron microscope strongly stimulated frog neuromuscular junctions, and indirectly supported by the work of his group in the following years, using electrophysiology, electron microscopy and quick freezing techniques. The actual term, kiss-and-run, was introduced by Ceccarelli's collaborators after the first studies of simultaneous membrane capacitance and amperometric transmitter release measurements were performed and indicated that secretory products could actually be released during transient vesicle fusion. Today, there is back and forth debate over full fusion and kiss-and-run fusion and which model portrays a more accurate picture of the mechanisms behind synaptic release. The increased accumulation of partially empty secretory vesicles following secretion, observed in electron micrographs are the most compelling evidence in favor of the kiss-and-run model. Accumulation of partially empty vesicles following secretion suggests that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular contents are able to exit the cell, which could only be possible if secretory vesicles were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane, expel a portion of their contents, then detach and reseal. Discovery Transient vesicle fusion was hypothesized by Katz and del Castillo in 1955. However, the first systematic studies were conducted by Ceccarelli et al. in 1973. Ceccarelli et al. studied frog neuromuscular junctions, stimulating them with markers such as horseradish peroxidase to identify endocytosed organelles, and using either mild stimulation (2 Hz) or strong stimulation (10 Hz) protocols for periods ranging from 20 minutes to 4 hours. At low stimulation for a period of 4 hours, Ceccarelli et al. found that there was an increase in horseradish peroxidase labeled vesicles over time, and no increases in large organelles, indicative of the vesicles fusing quickly with the presynaptic membrane and then separating from it after releasing its neurotransmitters. They hypothesized that at low frequencies of stimulation, most of the vesicles are quickly re-formed from the presynaptic membrane during and after stimulation. Further studies in Ceccarelli's lab accumulated evidence on the hypothesis of transient fusion by comparing electrophysiological and morphological data. In particular, images of vesicle fusions were examined on freeze-fractured presynaptic membranes and on electron-microscope images obtained from terminals quick-frozen few ms after the delivery of a single shock to the nerve. In 1993 Alvarez de Toledo and colleagues directly demonstrated the occurrence of secretory product release during the momentary opening of a transiently fusng vesicle, by combining the measurement of membrane capacitance (that monitors changes in surface area) with amperometric detection of the release of mediators. This led Fesce et al. to recapitulate all the indirect evidence in favor of transient fusion and coin the term kiss-and-run. The most compelling evidence for transient or kiss-and-run fusion has come from the discovery of the porosome, a permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell. Evidence for kiss-and-run With the discovery of the kiss-and-run mechanism by Ceccarelli et al., there have been many subsequent studies done that give evidence supporting kiss-and-run fusion. All studies have suggested that there are two main advantages kiss-and-run fusion has over full fusion: 1) kiss-and-run enables more efficient vesicle recycling and 2) kiss-and-run can limit how much neurotransmitter is released due to a smaller fusion pore and a shorter time during which neurotransmitters can actually be released. One of the major problems of kiss-and-run evidence, and subsequently the basis for many counterarguments against kiss-and-run, is that because fusion is so short, it is very hard to capture an actual kiss-and-run event. However, accumulation of partially empty vesicles following secretion strongly favors the kiss-and-run mechanism, suggesting that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular contents are able to exit the cell, which could only be possible if secretory vesicles were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane, expel a portion of their contents, then detach and reseal. Since porosomes are permanent structures at the cell plasma membrane measuring just a fraction of the secretory vesicle size, demonstrates that secretory vesicles \\"transiently\\" dock and establish continuity, as opposed to complete collapse. Rat pancreatic beta cells Rat pancreatic beta cells release neurotransmitters through kiss-and-run fusion. In endocrine and neuroendocrine cells, synaptic-like vesicles (SLVs) undergo kiss-and-run, but it's been controversial whether large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) also undergo kiss-and-run. Studies have shown that LDCVs do undergo kiss-and-run exocytosis. MacDonald et al. used multiple approaches to test for kiss-and-run exocytosis in rat beta cells. By monitoring membrane patches of intact rat beta cells in the presence of 10 mM glucose and 5 mM forskolin, MacDonald et al. found that some vesicles underwent kiss-and-run, as seen by an exocytotic event followed by an endocytotic event of a similar magnitude. Kiss-and-run events accounted for 25% of LDCV exocytosis and 28% of SLV exocytosis. While LDCV kiss-and-run occurred 25% of the time in the presence of forskolin, in the absence of forskolin, LDCV kiss-and-run fusion occurred only 7% of the time. Because forskolin raises cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, cAMP seemingly plays a very important role in the mechanism in LDCV kiss-and-run fusion in rat pancreatic beta cells. SLV (pore diameter: 0.8 +/- 0.1 nm) and LDCV (pore diameter: 1.4 +/- 0.1 nm) fusion pores during kiss-and- run have been shown to be big enough to allow for efflux of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but are too small to release insulin in rat pancreatic beta cells. Thus, the kiss-and-run mechanism could be implicated in medical complications involving insulin. Hippocampal synapses Kiss-and-run exocytosis has been shown to occur at the synapses of neurons located in the hippocampus. Studies using FM1-43, an amphiphile dye inserted into the vesicles or membrane as a marker, have been instrumental in supporting kiss-and-run in hippocampal synapses. In hippocampal synapses, vesicles have been shown to allow the normal release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, without permitting FM1-43 dye to enter or escape from the vesicle, indicating a transient mechanism suggestive of kiss-and-run. Increases in osmolarity have also been shown to permit less dye release in hippocampal synapses. In varying hypertonic solutions, 70% more FM1-43 dye was released from vesicles stimulated in 0.5 osM than from vesicles stimulated in 1.5 osM. Vesicles located in hypertonic regions of the body therefore might be more likely to undergo a kiss-and-run mode of exocytosis. Mitochondria Mitochondria demonstrate kiss-and-run fusion in exchanging inner membrane materials. Studies using mitochondrial matrix-targeted green- photoactivated, red-fluorescent KFP and cyan-photoactivated, green- fluorescence PAGFP in rat cells have shown interactions where the KFP and PAGFP were transferred from one mitochondrion to another mitochondrion through transient fusion, suggesting a kiss-and-run mechanism. Unlike full fusion of mitochondria, which resulted in a single organelle, transient kiss-and-run fusion of two mitochondria resulted in two distinct membranes. Manipulation of the optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) gene had interesting effects on fusion between mitochondria. Silencing the Opa1 gene decreased full fusion activity of mitochondria after 24 hours, and full fusion activity was completely eliminated after the Opa1 gene was silenced for 48 hours. Transient kiss-and- run fusion activity remained the same after 24 hours of Opa1 silencing. Kiss- and-run fusion is most common with low levels of Opa1 gene expression and extremely high levels of Opa1 gene expression. As a result, Opa1 expression governs fusion in mitochondria with regard to kiss-and-run. Kiss-and-run fusion in mitochondria help to keep mitochondria in a reduced motility state for shorter period of time compared to full fusion. Liu et al. tested both kiss-and-run and full fusion and their effects on mitochondrial motility, and found that both forms of fusion resulted in decreased mitochondrial motility at first, but kiss-and-run fusion restored, and even increased, mitochondrial motility immediately after the kiss-and-run event was over. Kiss-and-run fusion provides a better mechanism to control mitochondrial bioenergetics than full fusion. Regulation Calcium-dependent actin coating Kiss-and-run fusion has been thought to be stabilized by an actin coating of vesicles. Testing for the vesicle uptake of FM1-43 to note when vesicles fused with the membrane allowed researchers to notice that actin coating is a necessary step for the kiss-and-run mechanism. Vesicles labelled with the Beta-actin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluoresced seconds after fusing with the presynaptic membrane (as shown by FM1-43 uptake), but non-fused vesicles never fluoresced, suggesting that an actin coating is required for kiss-and-run. This actin coating came from the polymerization of actin monomers. The actin coating process necessary for transient kiss-and-run fusion is mediated by calcium. Actin coating of vesicles was inhibited by BAPTA-AM, which removes calcium. With the absence of calcium through the use of BAPTA-AM, all fused vesicles remained attached to the presynaptic membrane but did not release its neurotransmitters, suggesting that calcium is required to make the actin coating, and that the actin coating is responsible in the mechanism for vesicle unloading or vesicle release. Myosin II Kiss-and-run exocytosis is regulated by myosin II. Studies using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) in neuroendocrine PC12 cells showed that myosin II regulates fusion pore dynamics during kiss-and-run exocytosis. Over- expression of normal myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) in mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) tagged tissue and Venus-tagged brain tissue resulted in prolonged release kinetics, while over-expression of a mutant form of myosin II RLC short shortened release kinetics. Prolonged release kinetics is indicative of a slower closing of the fusion pore, so myosin II also regulates how much neurotransmitter is released during kiss-and-run exocytosis. SNAREs Much scholarly debate exists over the role of SNARE proteins in kiss-and-run exocytosis. SNARE proteins mediate vesicle fusion - the exocytosis of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane at the fusion pore. When a vesicle fuses with the presynaptic membrane, a SNARE transition occurs from a trans position to a cis position, followed by SNARE dissociation. This process was thought to be irreversible. If kiss-and-run exocytosis occurs, however, then it would suggest that reversible association of SNARE proteins occurs and mediates the kiss-and-run mode of exocytosis. Manipulation of the SNARE proteins during kiss-and-run may give more insight to how the two relate, and more scholarly research is required.

Originally all handwoven, it is now mostly machine woven and has been since the introduction of mechanised looms in the 1950s/1960s. Donegal has for centuries been producing tweed from local materials in the making of caps, suits and vests. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, The Royal Linen Manufacturers of Ulster distributed approximately six thousand flax spinning wheels and sixty looms for weaving to various Donegal homesteads. These machines helped establish the homespun tweed industry in nineteenth-century Donegal.Hoad, Judith (1987). This Is Donegal Tweed, Shoestring Publications, Inver. Although Donegal tweed has been manufactured for centuries it took on its modern form in the 1880s, largely due to the pioneering work of English philanthropist Alice Rowland Hart. Donegal Tweed fabric ‚Äì with the characteristic small pieces of yarn in different colours While the weavers in County Donegal produce a number of different tweed fabrics, including herringbone and check patterns, the area is best known for a plain-weave cloth of differently-coloured warp and weft, with small pieces of yarn in various colours woven in at irregular intervals to produce a heathered effect. Such fabric is often labelled as \\"donegal\\" (with a lowercase \\"d\\") regardless of its provenance. Along with Harris Tweed manufactured in the Scottish Highlands, Donegal is the most famous tweed in the world. While tweed in Ireland is by no means exclusive to Donegal, Vawn Corrigan confirms Donegal as the heartland of Irish Tweed . It was used in several of the fashion designer Sybil Connolly's pieces.  Magee of Donegal Town  The firm of Magee dates back to 1866. It was established by John Magee (1849‚Äì1901) who established a retail shop in the Diamond, in Donegal Town. He also bought tweed from Ardara and Carrick from part-time weavers who also worked as farmers and fishermen. In 1887, John Magee's cousin Robert Temple (1866‚Äì1958) came to work in the shop as an apprentice. On the death of John Magee in 1901, Temple took over the business. He continued using the outworkers to make tweed but in order to improve quality he established a system of sending out patterns and materials to these workers. Later he established a small factory in Donegal Town where some of the outworkers worked full-time under his supervision. Robert Temple expanded the business significantly until his death in 1958. Robert's son Howard Temple (1913‚Äì2010) began working with his father in 1931. One of the most significant figures in the history of Donegal tweed, Howard Temple carried Magee to new heights. The number of weavers (both in-house and outworkers) were greatly increased and he began the process of making Donegal tweed an international brand. To this end he collaborated very closely with the Irish fashion designers Sybil Connolly and Irene Gilbert. In 1966 he also established a large factory in Donegal Town manufacturing ready-to-wear men's clothes which at its peak employed approximately 300 people. The current proprietors of Magee are Howard Temple's son Lynn and Lynn's children Charlotte and Patrick. Magee continues to be the largest and most famous producers of Donegal tweed. Magee clothing is worn by the 9th President of Ireland Michael D Higgins.  Triona Design  A fifth- generation hand weaver, Denis Mulhern, had a strong desire to ensure that the tradition of handweaving was maintained and preserved. In 1992, Triona became the Bord F√°ilte Ireland approved Triona Donegal Tweed Centre and the Mulhern family began to welcome visitors from across the world to showcase first-hand the skills involved in hand weaving. The entire Mulhern family have dedicated their lives to protecting and nurturing the skill, craft and heritage of the traditional Donegal Tweed.Official website  Smaller Donegal tweed companies  Based in Kilcar, Co Donegal, Studio Donegal was founded in 1979 to preserve the tradition of hand weaving. Originally established by the now defunct Connemara Fabrics under the leadership of Kevin Donaghy. Kevin and his wife Wendy bought the operation from Connemara Fabrics, and it continues today under the management of their son, Tristan Donaghy. Remaining true to its original objective, all the tweed produced in Studio Donegal is genuinely hand woven. Eddie Doherty continues to hand weave in his shop/weaving room in Ardara Co Donegal.  The Weaver  \\"The Donegal Weaver was, and indeed still is, a singular type of man. He normally has a long Celtic face with good long- fingered hands, a highly sensitive touch, and an inherent feeling for colour, amazingly dexterous feet and an inbuilt sense of rhythm. This freedom of movement is vigorously displayed in the skillful dancing of jigs and reels at the weaver's parties held each year in Donegal Town.\\" (Studio Donegal has a young female weaver, so the skill is not solely the domain of men) References Category:County Donegal Category:Woven fabrics Category:Goods manufactured in Ireland ","title":"Donegal tweed"},{"id":"33987745","text":"Merson may refer to: *Billy Merson (1879‚Äì1947), English music hall performer and songwriter *George F.

In 1928, Arakatsu became a professor in Taihoku Imperial University (now called National Taiwan University). In 1934 Arakatsu built a particle accelerator at Taihoku Imperial University in Taipei, Taiwan, and performed the first atomic nucleus collision experiment in Asia there, right after the experiment performed in Cavendish Laboratory of University of Cambridge. He discovered that each nuclear fission of a U-235 atom yields, on average, 2.6 neutrons. In 1936, he became a professor in Kyoto Imperial University (now called University of Kyoto). In 1943, during World War II, he ran the Japanese Naval research program into nuclear technology, known as the F-Go Project. Next to Yoshio Nishina, Arakatsu was the most notable nuclear physicist in Japan. His team included Hideki Yukawa, who would become in 1949 the first Japanese physicist to receive a Nobel Prize. Early on in the war Commander Kitagawa, head of the Navy Research Institute's Chemical Section, had requested Arakatsu to carry out work on the separation of Uranium-235. The work went slowly, but shortly before the end of the war he had designed an ultracentrifuge (to spin at 60,000 rpm) which he was hopeful would achieve the required results. Only the design of the machinery was completed before the Japanese surrender. After the Americans atom bombed Hiroshima, he was transferred to Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai to form an investigative commission. This commission inspected the affected area to determine the effects of the bomb. After the war, his reports and artifacts were largely destroyed or confiscated by the occupying GHQ, which brought much protest from Arakatsu and the international community. Whatever documents that had survived the purge are now kept in the Yamato Museum in Kure.

Nkondi are a subclass of minkisi that are considered aggressive. The name nkondi derives from the verb -konda, meaning \\"to hunt\\" and thus nkondi means \\"hunter\\" because they can hunt down and attack wrong-doers, witches, or enemies. Functions Nkisi Nkondi, Congo, c. 1880-1920. Nkisi Nkondi, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. The primary function of a nkondi is to be the home of a spirit which can travel out from its base, hunt down and harm other people. Many nkondi were publicly held and were used to affirm oaths, or to protect villages and other locations from witches or evildoers. This is achieved by enlisting spiritual power through getting them to inhabit minkisi like nkondi. The vocabulary of nkondi has connections with Kongo conceptions of witchcraft which are anchored in the belief that it is possible for humans to enroll spiritual forces to inflict harm on others through cursing them or causing them to have misfortune, accidents, or sickness. A frequently used expression for hammering in the nails into a nkondi is \\"koma nloka\\" (to attach or hammer in a curse) derives from two ancient Bantu roots *-kom- which includes hammering in its semantic field, and *-dog- which involves witchcraft and cursing.Vansina, Paths in the Rainforest, p. 299. \\"Kindoki\\", a term derived from the same root is widely associated with witchcraft, or effecting curses against others, but in fact refers to any action intended to enlist spirits to harm others. If exercised privately for selfish reasons, the use of this power is condemned as witchcraft, but if the power is used publicly by a village, tribe, political leaders, or as a protective measure by innocent people, however, it is not considered witchcraft.Simon Bockie, Death and the Invisible Powers: The World of Kongo Belief'(Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1993), pp. 40-66.' In the catechism of 1624, which probably reflects Christian language dating back to the now lost catechism of 1557, the verb koma was used to translate \\"to crucify.\\" Marcos Jorge, ed. Mateus Cardoso, ed. Doutrina Crist√£a (Lisbon, 1624) Modern edition with French translation, ed. Fran√ßois Bontinck and D. Ndembi Nsasi (Brussels, 1978). History Because they are aggressive, many nkondi with human figures are carved with their hands raised, sometimes bearing weapons. The earliest representation of an nkisi in this pose can be seen in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Kongo, designed around 1512 and illustrated between 1528 and 1541, where a broken \\"idol\\" is shown with this gesture at the base of the shield.C√©cile Fromont, \\"Under the Sign of the Cross in the Kingdom of Kongo: Shaping Images and Molding Faith in Early Modern Central Africa,\\" PhD dissertation, Harvard University, 2008, p.90-91. Nailed minkisi are not described in the literature left by missionaries or others in the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. Wyatt MacGaffey, citing the work of the late seventeenth century Capuchin missionary Luca da Caltanisetta, noted that in his day, nganga sometimes banged minkisi together, perhaps a method of activating them, and nails, which MacGaffey contends were first being made at the time eventually replaced the metaphor.Wyatt MacGaffey, Kongo Political Culture': The Conceptual Challenge of the particular (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000), p. 99 Other scholars believe that the Portuguese missionaries brought images of Christ nailed to the cross and the martyr Saint Sebastian to the peoples of Central Africa, and these experts believe that this iconography maybe have influenced nkisi tradition.Zdenka Volavka, \\"The Nkisi of Lower Zaire,\\"African Arts 5 (1972): 52-89. MacGaffey, for his part, speaks against this interpretation, arguing that the concept of nailing is tied up with too many other concepts to be a simple misunderstanding of missionary teaching.MacGaffey, Kongo Political Culture p. 99. Nkondi with nails were made at least as early as 1864, when the British Commodore A. P. Eardley Wilmont acquired one while suppressing Solongo (Soyo) piracy at the mouth of the Congo River, a piece that was the subject of a contemporary painting and is presently in the Royal Geographical Institute in London.Wyatt MacGaffey, \\"Commodore Wilmont Encounters Kongo Art 1865,\\" African Arts (Summer, 2010): 52-54. Another early description and illustration of a nailed nkondi (named Mabiala mu ndemba, and described as a \\"thief-finder\\") is found in the notes of the German expedition to Loango of 1873-76, so by that time the specific practice of nailing was well established.Beatrix Heintze, ed. Eduard Peuch√´l-Loesche, Tagb√ºcher von der Loango K√ºste (Zentral-Afrika) (24.2.1875-5.5.1876)(Frankfurt-am-Main, 2011) entry of 1 April 1875, illustrated in Abb 8. Female Nkisi Nkonde figure held at the Birmingham Museum of Art. Construction Nkondi, like other minkisi, are constructed by religious specialists, called nganga (plural zinganga or banganga). The nganga gathers materials, called nlongo (plural bilongo or milongo), which when assembled, will become the home of a spirit. Often these materials include a carved human figure into which the other bilongo are placed. The nganga then either becomes possessed with the spirit or places the finished nkondi in a graveyard or other place where spirits frequent. Once it is charged, the nkondi can then be handed over to the client. According to Kongo testimony of the early twentieth century, people drive nails into the figures as part of a petition for help, healing, or witness-particularly of contracts and pledges. The purpose of the nailing is to \\"awaken\\" and sometimes to \\"enrage\\" the nkisi to the task in hand. Nkondi figures could be made in many forms, including pots or cauldrons, which were described and sometimes illustrated in early twentieth century Kikongo texts.MacGaffey, Kongo Political Culture, pp. 100-101. Those that used human images (kiteke) were most often nailed, and thus attracted collectors' attention and are better known today. Human figures ranged in size from small to life-size, and contained bilongo (singular longo; often translated as \\"medicine\\"), usually hidden by resin-fixed mirrors. Nkondi in the form of wooden figures were often carved with open cavities in their bodies for these substances. The most common place for storage was the belly, though such packs are also frequently placed on the head or in pouches surrounding the neck. In most nkondi figures the eyes and medicine pack covers were reflective glass or mirrors, used for divination. The reflective surface enabled the nkisi to see in the spirit world in order to spy out its prey. Some nkondi figures were adorned with feathers. This goes along with the concept of the figures as being \\"of the above\\", and associates them with birds of prey. The creation and use of nkondi figures was also a very important aspect to their success. Banganga often composed the nkondi figures at the edge of the village. The village was thought of as being similar to the human body. The idea that the edge and entrances needed to be protected from evil spirits occurred in both the human body and the village. When composing the minkisi, the nganga is often isolated in a hidden camp, away from the rest of the village. After the nkisi was built and the nganga had learned its proper use and the corresponding songs, he returned to the village covered in paint and behaving in a strange manner. The unusual behavior was to illustrate the ngangas return to the land of the living. Prior to using the nkondi, the nganga recited specific invocations to awaken the nkondi and activate its powers. During their performances, banganga often painted themselves. White circles around the eyes allowed them to see beyond the physical world and see the hidden sources of evil and illness. White stripes were painted on the participants. Often, the nganga was dressed similar to his nkondi. Banganga generally dressed in outfits that were vastly different than normal people. They wore ornate jewelry and often incorporated knots in their clothing. The knots were associated with a way of closing up or sealing of spiritual forces. Nkondi in the diaspora Kongo spirituality, concepts, and religious traditions made its way back to the Native Black Americans via the Atlantic Slave trade; many African diasporic religions in the Afro Americas, Lucumi, notably Palo, incorporates such traditions and customs. Robert Farris Thompson, an American art historian has been particularly diligent, and influential in identifying Kongo influences in the African descended population of the Americas.Robert Farris Thompson, The Flash of the SpiritRobert Farris Thompson and Robert Cornet, Four Moments of the Sun Nkondi in contemporary art European art collectors were interested in nkondi, especially the nailed ones, when they were reported back in the publications of the German Loango Expedition, which brought a good number of them back to Europe. Robert Visser, a German trader and diplomat also collected a great many examples for German museums, particularly in Berlin and Stuttgart. Many were purchased, others confiscated or removed by colonial authorities, and often found their way to museums, but many also remain in private hands. More recently, artists have worked with the concept and visual imagery of nkondi to produce new works inspired by nkondi. African American artist Renee Stout's \\"Fetish no. 2\\" first exhibited in 1988 is perhaps the most famous of these, a life sized statue cast from Stout's own body with the glass eye features and a few nails reminiscent of nkondi.

The Arabic text is itself an 8th-century translation by Ibn al-Muqaffa' of a Middle Persian version of the Sanskrit Panchatantra from about 300.Juan Manuel Cacho Blecua y Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Lacarra, ¬´Introducci√≥n¬ª, ed. lit. de Calila e Dimna, Madrid, Castalia (Cl√°sicos Castalia, 133), 1984, p√°g. 10. It is linked with the wisdom manuals of prince's education through the eastern method of questions and answers between the king and a philosopher that leads to exemplary tales or exempla told by and featuring animals: an ox, a lion and two jackals called Calila and Dimna, which are who tell the majority of the tales. This structure is used in Don Juan Manuel's Tales of Count Lucanor.  Authorship  This story has arrived to us through two manuscripts named as A and B. In the last part of the first one (from the first third of the 15th century) it is said that the book \\"was translated from Arabic to Latin, later it was Romanised by order of don Alfonso in 1261\\".fue sacado de ar√°bigo en latin, et roman√ßado por mandato del infante don Alfonso [...] era de mill e dozientos e noventa y nueve a√±os However, as the Spanish version is very near the Arabic one, a translation to Latin can be discarded. The fact that Alfonso is called \\"infante\\" (he was crowned in 1252) leads to set the date of composition in 1251 what would convert the book into the first prose-fiction work written in the Iberian Peninsula.  Structure  The main structure of the work is the narrative frame (the conversation between the king Dabshalem and the alguacil- philosopher Burduben). It has three parts clearly differentiated: * The introduction by Al-Muqaffa, an apology of knowledge and its practice nature. * Bercebuey's story (two chapters): ** His trip to India searching for knowledge. ** Contemptu mundi. * Calila e Dimna's story. In it we can distinguish two parts: **From chapter III to VI, the nearest part to Panchatantra. **Other, which encompasses the rest of the chapters and that follows simple organisative schemes and with Oriental parallelims.  Summary The King Dabschelim is visited by the philosopher Bidpai who tells him a collection of stories with important morals for a King. The stories are in response to requests of parables from Dabschelim and they follow a Russian doll format, with stories interwoven within the stories. Story One - The person who infiltrates a friendship to break it up and its consequences Main Story - The Lion and the Ox The Ox, Shatrabah, was abandoned by his master due to being stuck in a mud pit and was left to be watched by a servant. However, the servant grew tired of waiting and also abandoned Shatrabah and told his master that the ox had died. Nevertheless, Shatrabah managed to free himself and make his way to a lush pasture where he lived in peace. But the solitude took its toll on Shatrabah and he would moo loudly in despair and loneliness. The sounds of his wails reached the ears of the lion king who ruled the area. The lion had a court of many animals and predators but had never heard the wailing of an ox. From the lion's court were two doormen jackals, the brothers Kalila and Dimnah. Dimnah was an ambitious jackal and wanted to earn the favour of the king and become his most trusted member of the court. Kalila tried to dissuade Dimnah of his plans, but was rebuffed by Dimnah's ambition. Dimnah managed to gain entry into the court with his silvertongue, which impressed the lion king and so, he rose rapidly in rank and quickly became the lion's closest advisor. Upon hearing the wails of Shatrabah, the lion became anxious and wary of venturing outside, as his scouts had reported on the marvellous beast, with its huge horns and menacing frame (as Shatrabah had put on weight while grazing in the lush meadow), who was the source of the noise. Dimnah was concerned with the king's abandonment of his daily patrol and duties, so he approached the king and calmed him down. Dimnah then went and confronted Shatrabah and painted the picture of the fierce lion king and his court of predators to the ox. Shatrabah was in awe and fear of the king described to him and obeyed Dimnah's claim of a summons from the king and went back with Dimnah. However, on arrival the ox and the lion struck up a friendship and as days passed, their bond grew and Shatrabah took Dimnah's place as the main confidant of the king. As the days passed, a fierce jealousy consumed Dimnah and he became set on taking down Shatrabah. He confided in his brother Kalila, who warned him against his plans but to no avail. Dimnah first approached the lion and told him that Shatrabah was plotting against him and was planning to usurp the power for himself. The king was skeptical of Dimnah's claims of treason, due to his knowledge of the meek nature of his ox friend. But Dimnah persisted and convinced the lion of Shatrabah's planned treachery and Dimnah advised the lion that the only way to resolve the treason was to punish the ox by death. The lion decided to confront Shatrabah about these plans and then exile him. Dimnah, knowing the plan would be unravelled if they were allowed to talk, told the lion that if Shatrabah's limbs were trembling and if he was moving his horns as if preparing to charge, then there was no doubt regarding his treason. Dimnah then quickly went to Shatrabah and told him of the lion's plan to kill him and feast on his flesh with his court. But Shatrabah was skeptical of Dimnah's claims as he knew of no crime that he had committed which could have resulted in such a punishment. But he was convinced that the evil members of the lion's court had turned the king against him and that only Dimnah stood by his side. Shatrabah reasoned that the lion's carnivorous nature had won out and that a herbivore like himself had held no place in such a court in the first place. Spurred by Dimnah's whisperings, Shatrabah prepared himself to engage the lion in combat to save his life. Dimnah told the ox that if the lion approaches you with his chest out and mouth open, then know he has come to kill you. Dimnah then went to his brother and told him of his near success before scampering off to witness the showdown. When the lion confronted the ox, they each saw the other exactly as Dimnah had described and so launched themselves at each other. Shatrabah was killed and the lion was left heavily wounded. Kalila severely scolded his brother for his actions and warned him of the fatal consequences of his deception if he was to be uncovered. The lion king while licking his wounds regretted killing his friend Shatrabah and started to become suspicious of Dimnah. Meanwhile, a leopard from amongst the closest members of the king's court was prowling in the dark, when he came upon Kalila admonishing Dimnah for his deception and he overheard the whole thing. The leopard immediately went to the lion's mother and upon swearing her to secrecy told her of Dimnah's dastardly scheme. The mother visited her son the next day and saw how his remorse was eating him up and she scolded him for acting without proper investigation. While she was there Dimnah paid a visit to the king and got in a spat with the lion's mother who accused him of treachery and scheming against the king. Dimnah attempted to save the situation with his eloquence but only managed to get thrown into prison. While in prison, he was visited by his brother Kalila who reminded him of his earlier warnings to not carry out his plot. However, unbeknown to them both a cheetah lay imprisoned with Dimnah, and he overheard the whole confession and was willing to testify against Dimnah in the judge's court. When the court case came, the judge asked for witnesses and warned them all of the punishment in the hereafter if they hid their testimony. The leader of the pigs tried to defame Dimnah, but Dimnah skilfully talked his way out and managed to avoid any further scandal. During Dimnah's spell in prison, Kalila fell ill out of grief and guilt and died. A fellow jackal Rawzbah visited Dimnah in prison and informed him of his brother's passing, to which Dimnah was very bereaved. Meawhile the lion pressured his mother into revealing the source of her information regarding Dimnah's plan. She summoned the leopard who testified against Dimnah, as did the imprisoned cheetah, which was enough for the judge to pass the death sentence. And so Dimnah was mercilessly executed. Sub-story One - The Man and the Wolf - Told by the master to his servant upon learning of the ox's ‚Äúdemise‚Äù. A man was travelling in the wild when he saw a threatening wolf, so in order to escape he ran but came to a ravine with a river preventing safe passage to the village on the other side. Faced with death at the hands of the wolf, the man took his chances and jumped in the river in an attempt to swim across. The current was too strong and he was being pulled away, when a group of villagers saw him and came to his aid. After being saved and taken to the village he decided to rest for a while in an empty hut on the outskirts of the village, however to his surprise he entered upon a group of bandits distributing their loot. In fear of his life, he quickly took off and ran into an alley where he leant against a wall to catch his breath. The wall then fell on him and he died. Sub-story two - The Monkey and the Carpenter - Told by Kalila to Dimnah to discourage him from his plans to get involved with the royal court. A carpenter had a pet monkey who watched him work all day. The monkey dreamed of using the hammer and pegs of the carpenter, and so one day when the carpenter went for a break he seized the opportunity. The monkey grabbed the hammer and went to hammer a peg into the piece of wood, but unwittingly his tail had got caught in the gap without him noticing, so when the hammer came down the peg was driven into the monkey's tail and he fell unconscious from the pain. However, when the carpenter returned to find the monkey's handiwork, the monkey became victim of an even more painful punishment for his foolishness. Sub-story three and four are part of the main story Sub-story five - The crow and the serpent - Told by Dimnah to Kalila, defending his ability to take on the mighty ox with wit despite his small frame. There was a crow who lived in a tree with a serpent who lived at the bottom in his burrow. However, the snake would eat the eggs of the crow. In revenge, the crow intended to claw out the snake's eyes, but he was discouraged by a jackal who told him to play smart. The jackal advised the crow to steal the jewelry of a human and make a show of throwing it into the snake's burrow. When the crow did this, the humans followed the crow to the burrow and upon finding the snake killed it and retrieved the jewelry, thus relieving the crow of the snake. Sub-story of sub-story five - The toad and the crab - Told by the jackal to the crow as a warning that sometimes plans fail and have bad endings. There was a toad who lived in a pond full of fish and would eat to his fill daily, however as he grew old he could not fish and so grew hungry. As the toad sat there, old, hungry and sad, thinking of a solution, a passing crab took pity on him and asked what the problem was. The toad told the crab that fishermen were going to come and take all the fish, so he was going to die of hunger. The crab told all the fish the news and they all went to the toad for advice. The toad suggested moving to a new and safer pond nearby, and he offered to transport two fish daily. The fish took upon his offer, but the toad would take the fish and would eat them and spit their bones out near the other pond. One day the crab asked to be transferred as he had become lonely, so the toad took him, but when they arrived the crab saw the heap of bones and realised what the toad had been doing the whole time, and so quickly grabbed the toad in its pincers and snapped its neck. Sub-story six - The Rabbit and the Lion - Told by Dimnah to Kalila defending his ability in taking down the Ox after Kalila deemed him unfit for the job There was a lion that ruled a jungle, the occupants gathered together and offered to present the lion an animal a day as an offering, so he would not hunt them. One day the draw fell to a rabbit to deliver the meal to the lion, however the rabbit did not arrive on time and kept the lion hungry and waiting. When the rabbit arrived, he came empty-handed, furious the lion demanded to know why. The rabbit claimed that he was going to present another rabbit as a meal, but that rabbit refused and claimed that he was going to feed himself to the real king of the jungle, another lion. The lion incensed by this challenge of authority demanded the rabbit to take him to the other lion. The rabbit took the lion to the edge of a well and showed the lion their reflection and told the lion that there was the other rabbit and lion. The lion roared and jumped into the well to attack and drowned. Sub-story seven - The three fish - Told by Dimnah to the lion in an attempt to persuade him that the Ox will betray him, so he should strike first There were three fish in a pond, a wise one, a smart one and a shortsighted one. The fish overheard two fishermen walk past and say that they would come back and catch all the fish in the pond. The wise fish heard this and immediately left the pond and joined the river that flowed into the pond. The smart fish delayed until the fishermen arrived, but when he tried to leave he was blocked by the nets of the fishermen. So he flopped out of the pond and pretended to be a dead fish so that the fishermen move him closer to the river, and when they did, he jumped into the river and swam away. As for the shortsighted fish, he was caught. Sub-story eight - The louse and the flea- Told by Dimnah to the lion in an attempt to persuade him that the Ox will betray him, after the lion doubted Dimnah's claim of the Ox's betrayal There was a louse who would stay in the bed of a richman and drink his blood daily without getting caught. Then a flea visited one day and went with the louse to drink the blood of the richman, but when the flea bit the man, he ran away and the man woke up. The man only saw the louse and so killed the louse out of anger and pain. Sub-story nine - The Wolf, the crow, the jackal and the camel - Told by Shatrabah to Dimnah after he suspects that it's the members of the lion's court that want him dead. There was a lion who had three companions, a wolf, a crow and a jackal. One day a camel left his flock to join the lion, where he stayed for a long time. One day the lion was injured by an elephant and could no longer hunt; this was a problem for the wolf, crow and jackal, as they would scavenge the leftovers of the lion's hunt. However they told the lion that they would hunt for him. Together they hatched a plan and proposed to the lion that they eat the camel, however the lion angrily rebuffed the idea as he didn't want to back-stab his friend. The crow tried to explain that sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good, and the lion stayed silent and that was the sign of his acceptance. So they plotted that the three of them would present themselves to the lion to be eaten along with the camel, but for each of the three the other two would intercede and they wouldn't eat him. So when the camel offered himself to the lion, they did not intercede and they all fell upon him and ate him. Sub-story ten - The sea bird and the sea agent - Told by Dimnah to Shatrabah while proving his point that a person should not underestimate a weak opponent There were two sandpipers who were a couple, they had a nest near the sea. The wife insisted on moving their nest to avoid the sea agent, but the husband refused and when the tide came in the sea agent took the nest. The male sandpiper decided to call upon the king of the birds, the phoenix, for help, which he received. The phoenix went with a contingent of birds to attack the sea agent and reclaim the nest, but the sea agent gave it up out of fear and avoided confrontation. Sub-story of sub-story ten - The Turtle and the two ducks - Told by the female sandpiper to the male sandpiper in an effort to convince him to move the nest A turtle lived in a pond with two ducks, but the pond's water levels were decreasing, so the turtle asked the ducks to help him move to another pond. Together they devised a plan that the ducks will hold two sides of a stick and fly to the other pond, while the turtle held on with its mouth. As they were flying, people on the ground started to marvel at this strange sight. The turtle, who was very self-conscious, cursed the onlookers, but in doing so, opened his mouth and fell to the ground and died. Sub-story eleven - The monkeys and the bird - Told by Kalila to Dimnah, after Dimnah ignored all of Kalila's warnings and carried out his plan which killed the ox and injured the lion There was a troop of monkeys, who were cold and searching for fire one night, when they saw a glow worm and started to chase it. An onlooking bird knew that it was a glow worm and not fire and so called out to them to stop their futile chase, as it would not give them the warmth they desired. The monkeys ignored the bird and carried on. The bird was determined to convince them of their error, when a man said to the bird to leave the monkeys alone, because they are too stubborn to accept their error. The bird refused to listen to the man and flew to the monkeys to convince them, but they got angry and grabbed the bird and threw him to the ground, killing him. Sub-story twelve - The cunning person and the naive person - Told by Kalila to Dimnah, warning him of the outcome of being cunning. Two businessmen were travelling, when they came across a case of a thousand dinars (gold coins). The cunning one proposed to the naive man that they each take a small portion and bury the rest under a nearby tree, and when any of them needed any of it, they would both return and take whatever was needed. The naive man agreed and they buried the case and went their separate ways. However, the cunning man returned, dug up the treasure and took it all. After some time, the naive man visited the cunning man and told him that he needed some of the money, so they both went to the tree, dug up the area and found nothing. Immediately the cunning man turned on the naive man and accused him of taking all the money. The naive man, protesting his innocence, ended up in court with the cunning man. The judge asked the cunning man to provide evidence for his claim, the cunning man claimed that the tree would testify that the naive man stole all the money. The judge, intrigued, took the court to the tree to hear its testimony. The cunning man had told his father to hide in the tree and pretend to be the voice of the tree when asked questions. After the tree answered the judges questions, the flabbergasted judge ordered the tree to be burnt down. The father, within the tree, started to scream and jumped out of the tree and confessed to the judge the whole plot. The judge then ruled in favour of the naive man and the cunning man had to return the dinars (gold coins). Sub-story thirteen - The merchant, the iron and the mice - Told by Kalila to Dimnah, scolding him as his image will be forever ruined if he is found out A merchant was leaving his city for a while on a business trip, and he had a large amount of iron in his possession, so he left it in trust with his friend for storage until he returned. When he returned and asked for his iron, his friend said that mice had eaten all of it. The merchant, furious, left the house and kidnapped one of his friends children. The next day his friend approached him and asked if he had any knowledge of his child's whereabouts. The merchant replied that he saw a falcon swoop down and take him away the other day. His friend hit him on the head, baffled, and said ‚ÄúHave you ever seen a child be carried away by a falcon?!‚Äù. To which the merchant replied ‚ÄúYes!

Story Two - True brotherhood Main Story - The Collared Pigeon There was a crow who saw a hunter pass by and lay out a net and seeds. The crow watched as the hunter hid and a flock of pigeons along with their ruler, the collared pigeon, landed on the net to eat the seeds. When all the pigeons were trapped, they all tried to save themselves and fly away, but they were stuck. The collared pigeons ordered them to work together and fly off so that they could all be saved. The pigeons flew away while being pursued by the hunter and followed by the crow. The pigeon decided to ask his mouse friend to free all of them from the net, so they went to his hole and called him. The mouse freed the pigeons, which impressed the crow, who tried to become friends with him. The mouse was wary and hostile to a known predator. However the crow persisted and swore not to eat until the mouse becomes his friend. The mouse agreed to become his friend but was still afraid of the crows fellow crows, who were not as friendly as the crow. The crow promised to protect him and break ties with any crow who would be the mouse's enemy. After the friendship blossomed, the crow convinced the mouse to leave the human dwellings and move to the jungle and live with the crow and his tortoise friends. So the crow took the mouse by the tail and flew him to the jungle. One day, they were all relaxing in the jungle, when suddenly a deer burst into the gathering. Startled, the crow flew off, the mouse went into his hole and the tortoise into his shell. But when they realised that the deer was alone they approached him. The deer told them that he was on the run from two hunters. The group of animals offered the deer to stay with them, out of the way of the hunters and safe, an offer which the deer accepted. After a while, one day, the crow flew into the air to find his friend, the deer. He found the deer caught in the net of two hunters, so he quickly returned to his friends and told them of their friend's plight. They rushed to save the deer, with the mouse cutting the net. However, the tortoise had also followed them to save his friend, they told him off for endangering himself, as he would be too slow if the hunters returned. Suddenly, the hunters returned and the friends ran and flew away, but the tortoise was caught. The friends hatched a plan to save the tortoise, wherein the deer and crow would bait the hunter further and further away from his camp, while the mouse freed the tortoise. After freeing the tortoise, the friends regrouped, and the hunter, now without any caught game, realised his predicament and became convinced that he was in a land of djinn or going insane, so he left.

One day, the man had a guest, who he asked to get rid of the mouse. The guest dug a hole trying to find the mouse but found a case full of a hundred dinars (gold coins). The guest took the dinars (gold coins) and told the pious man that the coins allowed the mice to scavenge and so the guest and the man split the money between themselves. Meanwhile, the other mice approached the mouse for their normal supply of food, but he didn't have any, so they shunned him and left him alone. The pious man went to sleep and put the money near his head. The mouse intended on taking the money while the man slept, so as to make friends again, but every time he tried, he failed and was hit. So he left the house and lived in the open, where he became friends with the pigeons. ‚ÄôStory Three - The deceitful enemy Main Story - The Owl and the Crows There was a large murder of crows and a large parliament of owls living on a mountain.

The king disliked the counsel of the first four owls. The fifth crow suggested that the crow king rip off some of the advisor's own feathers and attack him, leaving him in a dishevelled state, so that he could infiltrate the owl colony as a double agent.

When the husband turtle was told about the cure, he returned to his friend and invited him to his home, a lush island with many trees laden with fruits, with the intent to kill him. The monkey agreed but the turtle became ashamed of his plans and tucked his head into his shell. The monkey became suspicious of the turtle and inquired about his behavior. The turtle told him that his wife was ill and so he feared he could not host the monkey to the best of his capability. They carried on to the island, with the monkey on the turtle's back. The turtle again mentioned his wife's illness and kept on acting more suspiciously. The monkey asked what the cure to his wife's illness was, and the turtle told him it was the heart of a monkey. The monkey suddenly very aware of his predicament told the turtle that he should have mentioned that before they left, because it was customary among monkeys to leave their hearts at home before visiting a friend. The monkey told the turtle that they should return, so the monkey could get his heart and gladly give it to the turtle's wife. The turtle overjoyed by his friends commitment, swam back to the olive tree, whereupon the monkey quickly scrambled ashore and up his tree.

The donkey readily followed the jackal to the lion, but the lion was too weak to attack it, frightened, the donkey ran away. The lion promised the jackal that if he had one more chance he would be able to attack the donkey and kill it. The jackal called the donkey back, claiming that the other donkeys wanted to welcome him. When the donkey returned, the lion pounced and caught the donkey. However the lion claimed that the doctors said one must eat the heart and ears after bathing. So while the lion went to bathe, the jackal ate the heart and ears of the donkey.

The jackal politely declined as he believed being involved in such affairs would only bring trouble. However, the lion insisted and the jackal accepted on the condition that if any case regarding the jackal was brought to the lion, he would not be hasty in his judgement. The lion appointed the jackal responsible for the treasury department. The other members of the lion's court grew jealous of the pious jackal and they all agreed to get the jackal in trouble. The lion loved meat and gave a large portion to the jackal to store. The next day when the lion asked for the meat, it did not arrive. He was told by his advisors that the jackal had taken it. Upon summoning the jackal, the jackal claimed he had given the meat to the appointed food person to give to the king. The appointed food person denied ever receiving the meat. The lion sent a search party to the jackal's house where they found the meat, thereby incriminating the jackal, resulting in him being thrown into jail.

Story Nine - Forbearance, the most important quality of a ruler Main Story - Iladh, Baladh and Irakht There was once a king called, Baladh. One night, he saw eight dreams that frightened him, so he called the monks to interpret the dreams. The monks said they would return with the interpretation in a week. The monks hated the king, for he had killed twelve thousand monks. The monks plotted to tell the king that the dreams meant he had to kill those whom he loved and cared for the most, then bathe in their blood and be spat on by the monks, before being washed by perfume in order to avoid a terrible fate. They told the king he must kill his wife Irakht, his child Juwayr, his nephew, his close friend Iladh, his scribe and secret keeper Kaal, his great white elephant, his battle horse, two other great elephants, his fast strong Bactrian camel and the wiseman Kabariyoon, who was responsible for the death of the monks. When the king was informed of this, he said he'd rather die than have his close ones killed. The king retreated to his quarters in sorrow and grief. Iladh realised that the king was hiding something and so told Irakht to approach the king and find out what was troubling him, as he had seen the king with some monks and feared they may have said something to him. Irakht approached her husband and he told her of the interpretation of the dream given by the monks. Irakht was frightened but knew of the monks hatred for the king and so comforted the king and told him to ask Kabariyoon for the correct interpretation. Kabariyoon told the king that it meant in one week he would receive amazing gifts. And so it transpired that a week later the king received amazing gifts. Overjoyed the king called his two wives Irakht and Hawraqnah to pick what they wanted from the gifts. Irakht picked a wreath and Hawraqanah picked a dress. The king would alternate his nights between his wives, one night, while with Irakht, Hawraqnah wore the shimmering beautiful dress and purposefully walked past the king. The king, transfixed and in love, scolded Irakht for choosing the wreath over the dress. Irakht angered by the criticism, struck her husband on the head with a plate. The king, shocked, called for Iladh and told him to execute his wife Irakht. Iladh knew that the king had issued the order in anger and would cool down and regret it later, so he took Irakht and hid her in a hut, he then returned to the king with a bloodied sword and told him he had killed her. The king, now calm and collected, regretted his decision and was in deep sorrow. He proclaimed his love for Irakht openly and his remorse. Iladh then approached the king and told him that Irakht was still alive. The king was overjoyed and welcomed her back and raised her and Iladh in status. The king then executed the monks who had tried to deceive him, thereby gaining closure from his dreams. Sub-story one - The two pigeons - Told by Iladh to the king to console him There was once a pigeon couple, and they filled their nest with barley and wheat grain.

A neighbouring jackal visited her and told her that she had had it coming as what goes around comes around. The lioness distressed and confused asked the jackal to explain. The jackal told her that the action of the horseman was no different to the lioness‚Äô own actions, as her prey also had parents who grieved the loss of their children. The lioness upon hearing this, changed her ways and became a vegetarian and would only eat fruits and would spend most of her day in worship. One day, two doves approached her and scolded her for eating all the fruit, as she was the cause of a fruit shortage, which was depriving many animals of their daily food.

Story Eleven - The benefit and importance of having a wise advisor Main Story - Mihrayiz the king of the rats Once upon a time in the city of Badoor, there lived a rat king, who ruled over all the rats in the city. The king had three advisors, Rudhbadh, Shira‚Äô and Baghdad. One day, they all gathered to discuss whether they could rid themselves of the ancestor's fear of cats. Rudhbadh said that one cannot change what they have genetically inherited from their ancestors. He suggested that the king consult the advisors for solutions. One suggested to tie bells to all the cats so that the rats were warned of their presence. The second dismissed the first's proposal and suggested that all the rats leave the city for a year, tricking the people into believing that no more cats are needed, so then they would kill all the cats, allowing the rats to return safely. The third, Rudhbadh, suggested that the king should instruct all the rats to split into groups and infiltrate the homes with cats. Then the rats should damage the clothes and furnishings of the house but leave the food, that way the people will assume that the damage is due to the cats. The rats should also damage according to how many cats lived in the house, the more cats the more damage. This would result in the populace killing all the cats and even removing the cats in the wild, to save their homes. The rats carried out this plan and therefore successfully caused the extermination of all the cats in the city and sowed the hatred of cats within the population for generations, so that no cat could live in Badoor ever again.

Near this tunnel was a marvellous palace, unrivalled in its brilliance. One day the king's advisors suggested that they close the tunnel and stop the winds, to make the palace area into a paradise. The advisors believed it may be impossible, but the king ordered all the people of the area to gather and block the hole with rocks, wood and soil. After much toil and effort the people succeeded in blocking the hole. However, this prevented the breeze and gales from the hole spreading, thus causing the trees and water to dry up. Six months had not passed and all the springs and crops had dried up, all the animals had died and a barren wasteland was left for hundreds of miles. Many people died and those who remained marched on the king and killed him and his advisors. The revolters then went to the hole and set fire to the wood that was blocking it to let the air out. Once slightly opened, the six months worth of trapped air burst out of the hole, taking the large fire with it and spreading it to all corners of the kingdom. Not one city, town or tree escaped the carnage of the fire.

So the next day, he broke out of captivity and followed the deer to the stream and tried to converse with it. However, the deer did not understand donkey talk. The donkey was convinced that it was the presence of the owner that was preventing them from conversing, so he attacked and bit the owner. The owner of the deer wanted to mark the donkey so he could find it later, so he sliced its ears off. The donkey, in pain, returned to its master, who was furious that it had run off, and received a worse punishment than having its ears sliced, from his own master. The donkey realised that such desires were foolish and pursuing them only ended badly.

The foreign guest really liked the dates and wanted to know how he could plant and grow the dates in his city. The pious man told him that his city already had many fruits, so there was no need to plant dates there. It would be an unnecessary burden and it may not even work, as your land may not be suitable for its growth. So the guest decided to drop the subject. The pious man spoke Hebrew and the guest wanted to also learn the language. The guest tried to learn the language and spent many days doing so. The pious man told the guest to stop ignoring his own tongue and focusing on Hebrew, as then he'd forget his mother tongue and will also still be inept at Hebrew, thereby failing at both.

However, the tourist ignored them and helped the jeweller out as well. The three animals told the tourist that if he ever needs any help while passing by their homes he should just call and they would answer. The jeweller told the tourist that if he ever went to the city Nawadirakht, he should seek him out and he may be able to return the favour. After some time had passed, by chance the tourist had to visit that city. As he approached, the monkey appeared and gifted him a juicy fruit, which he ate thankfully. Then, as he came to the door of the city, the tiger approached him and promised to repay him. The tiger went to one of the palace gardens, killed the princess and took her necklace, giving it to the tourist without telling him of its origin. The tourist, very happy by the treatment received from the animals, intended on approaching the jeweller. When the jeweller saw him, he welcomed him in and sat him down. When the jeweller saw the necklace, he immediately knew it was the princess‚Äô as he had made it himself for her. He took this as an opportunity and went to the palace and told them that the princess‚Äô murderer is at his home. The tourist was found with the necklace and promptly arrested. It was judged that he be punished and walked around the city and then crucified. While they were doing this, the tourist cried out in anguish how he should have listened to the three animals and not saved the man. The snake heard this and bit the prince, poisoning him such that none of the doctors could cure him. The snake then asked his djinn friend to make the prince believe that the only cure was if the tourist read an incantation over him, as they had wrongly punished him. The snake then entered the tourists cell and gave him a leaf which was the cure to his own poison and told the tourist to tell the prince his story and he should be freed.

At the end of the day he walked past the city gates and wrote on them ‚Äúa cost of a day when one works hard, is one dirham‚Äù. The next day the son of the nobleman went into the city and sat down under a tree and fell asleep. A city nobleman passed by and astonished by the beauty of the young man realised it to be the genetics of a noble household. Feeling sympathy for the boy he gifted him five hundred dirhams. The nobleman's son wrote on the gate ‚Äúa day‚Äôs worth of beauty is five hundred dirhams‚Äù. The next day the businessman's son went into the city. The boy went to the docks, where a fisherman's boat had bought in many fish. The businessmen of the city had gathered and planned to return later to buy it at a reduced price. The boy approached the fisherman and bought all the fish on credit for one hundred thousand dirhams. He then went about spreading the news that he planned on taking all the fish to another city. The businessmen in a panic rushed to buy from him and the boy made a profit of one hundred thousand dirhams. The businessman's son wrote on the gate ‚Äúthe price of a day‚Äôs worth of intelligence is one hundred thousand dirhams‚Äù. The next day the prince was sent into the city. The prince sat by the gates of the city and waited. It so transpired that that day the king had died and left no heir. When the funeral passed the prince, he was asked why he didn't grieve. The gatekeeper then arrested the prince and put him in jail. The next day when the city gathered to appoint a new leader, the gatekeeper told them of the strange boy near the gates the previous day. The prince was summoned and told the people of his ancestry and lineage and how his brother had usurped the throne after their father's demise, so he had fled the city. The people who had visited the prince's land in the gathering recognised him and supported his claim. The people then decided to appoint the prince as their new leader. During his coronation procession he passed the gates of the city and ordered for it to be written that ‚ÄúHardwork, beauty, intelligence and any good or bad one gains in this world is due to the decree of God‚Äù. The new king then summoned his companions and appointed the intelligent one as a minister and made the hardworking one a farmer. He then gave the handsome one a large sum of money to be rid of him. The king then gathered his advisors and talked to them regarding the importance of having faith and believing in God and fate. One advisor told the king of his own personal experience of fate. The advisor used to work for a nobleman who would pay him two dinars. One day, the advisor took the two dinars and went to the market with the intention of giving one in charity and keeping the other. He saw a man selling two captured hoopoe birds who were a couple. The man would only sell both of them together and only for the full price of two dinars. The advisor, intent on carrying out his deed, gave up bargaining and purchased the two malnutritioned birds for two dinars. He then released them in a lush garden full of fruit trees. The hoopoe birds decided to tell the advisor of a bag full of gold coins, hidden in a tree. The advisor took the bag and indeed it was full of gold coins. The advisor praised God for his turn in fortune. Story Fifteen - One who advises others but not himself Main Story - The pigeon, the fox and the heron There was once a pigeon who made a nest in a tree and laid an egg in it. When the egg was ready to hatch, a fox came to the foot of the tree and demanded that the pigeon give him the newborn chick to eat. This continued for the next egg too. One day a heron passed by the pigeon and advised it to challenge the fox to climb the tree and take the eggs himself. The next time the fox came, the pigeon acted on the heron's advice. The fox, stumped, asked the pigeon where it learnt such a retort. The pigeon informed the fox of her teacher the heron. The fox approached the heron, who had nested near the river. The fox asked the heron to show him how it could tuck its head under its wing. While the heron displayed this, the fox attacked the heron and killed it, all the while mocking the heron for providing the pigeon with a trick, but not being smart enough to avoid the fox's trick.

It has been mined for coal since the late 1800s. The basin takes its name after Zonguldak, Turkey, and lies at approximately 41¬∞ N. It is roughly elliptical in shape with its long axis oriented roughly southwest to northeast, and is adjacent to the Black Sea. Three main regions have been recognized in the Zonguldak basin: from west to east, Armutcuk, Zonguldak, and Amasra.Sinayu√ß, C., and G√ºmrah, F. (2009) Modeling of ECBM recovery from Amasra coalbed in Zonguldak Basin, Turkey, International Journal of Coal Geology, 77, 162-174 Depositional history The Zonguldak basin has undergone two major periods of deposition. The first period began in the Paleozoic, and the second began in the Cretaceous. Isolated areas of deposition in the basin occurred during the Late Permian through the Triassic as well as the Latest Jurassic. Paleozoic deposition The Zonguldak basin first experienced deposition in the Ordovician.Yal√ßin, M.N. and Yilmaz, I. (2010). Devonian in Turkey ‚Äì A review. Geologica Carpathica, 61 (3), 235-253 Deposition begins with the lower Ordovician So·∏°uksu Formation. The So·∏°uksu Formation is 700‚Äì1100 meters thick. At its base it consists of green shale and sandstone and coarsens upwards to arkosic conglomerates. The lower Ordovician Aydos Formation conformably overlies the So·∏°uksu. It is a conglomerate of quartzitic sandstone and is 50‚Äì200 meters thick. The Findikli Formation was deposited during the upper Ordovician, Silurian, and lowermost Devonian in the Zonguldak basin. It is 300‚Äì450 meters thick. Its facies are indicative of a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate shelf environment that is shallowing through time. The red, cross-bedded sandstones of the Ferizli Formation overlie the marly deposits of the Fendikli Formation. The oolitic sandstones contain iron and an iron ore. The formation, like the Findikli Formation, shows a shift toward shallower depositional environments and a shift to higher energy areas of deposition. The younger sediments of the Ferizli Formation become progressively more enriched in calcium carbonate and eventually give way to the Yilanli Formation. The Yilanli Formation is Visean in age and is the beginning of the coal-related sequences in the Zonguldak basin.G√∂r√ºr, N., Monod, O., Okay, A.I., Seng√∂r, A.M.C., T√ºys√ºz. O., Yiƒüitba≈ü, E., Sakin√ß M., and Akk√∂k, R. (1997) Paleogeographic and tectonic position of the Carboniferous rocks of the western Pontides (Turkey) in the frame of the Variscan belt. Bull. Soc. G√©ol. France, 168 (2), 195-205Ho≈üg√∂rmez, H. (2007). Origin and secondary alteration of coal bed and adjacent rock gasses in the Zonguldak Basin, western Black Sea, Turkey. Geochemical Journal, 41, 201-211 The Yilanli is a dolomitic limestone unit with calcareous black and gray shales. It was deposited in a shallow marine passive margin setting. It is conformably overlain by the Alacaagzi Formation, and has accumulated over 1000 m of sediment. The Alacaagzi Formation contains economic deposits of coal. It is comprised predominantly of crossbedded black shales and silts in the lower sections of the unit and progressively becomes composed of sands, shale bearing coals, and conglomerates towards the top of the formation. Facies analysis in the Alacaagzi Formation is suggestive of coastal environments including lacustrine, fluviatial, and fan deposits. Conformably overlaying the Alacaagzi Formation is the Kozlu Formation. The Kozlu contains 19 coal seams totalling 30‚Äì32 m. The Kozlu is composed of successional conglomerate, sand, silt, mud, and coal deposits. The Karadon Formation conformably overlies the Kozlu. The Karadon is lithologically similar to the Kozlu Formation, but contains less coal seams. An angular unconformity spans the top of the Karadon formation and ranges from 46.5 Ma‚Äì194 Ma in duration.Yal√ßin, M.N., Schenk, H.J., and Schaefer, R.G. (1994). Modelling of gas generation in coals of the Zonguldak basin (northwestern Turkey). International Journal of Coal Geology, 25, 195-212 Localized deposition Deposition resumes in the western portion of the Zonguldak basin with the deposition of the √áakraz Formation. The √áakraz spans the upper Permian through the Lower Jurassic. Unconformably overlying the √áakraz is the Inalti Formation. The Inalti was deposited during the upper Jurassic and is truncated by an unconformity. The carbonates of the Inalti are representative of a shallow passive margin setting.Channel, J.E.T., T√ºys√ºz, O., Bektas, O., and Seng√∂r, A.M.C. (1996). Jurassic-Cretaceous paleomagnetism and paleography of the Pontides (Turkey). Turkey, 15 (1), 201-212 Cretaceous deposition During the late Cretaceous, the Zonguldak basin was roughly 25¬∞ N, and was experiencing subsidence due to the formation of a back arc, the Black Sea. As a result, the Zonguldak experienced deposition from the early Cretaceous through the Eocene. Different authors present differing stratigraphic columns of the Zonguldak basin and this analysis will preferentially report more current research. The lithologies deposited during this period of deposition include limestones, mudstones, siltstones, and dolomites. The Albian, 105‚Äì100 Ma, Zonguldak Formation is predominantly limestone with areas of dolomitization.Ho≈üg√∂rmez, H., Yal√ßin, M.N., Cramer, B., Gerling, P., Faber, E., Schaefer, R.G., and Mann, U. (2002). Isotopic and molecular composition of coal-bed gas in the Amasra region (Zonguldak basin‚Äîwestern Black Sea). Organic Geochemistry,33, 1429-1439 It is conformably overlain by the Albian, 105‚Äì112 Ma, Kilimli Formation. The Kilimli is composed of sandstone and carbonaceous sandstone. The Kilimli is unconformably overlain by the sandy limestone of the Cemaller Formation. The unconformity lasts at least 6.5 Ma and the Zonguldak basin experiences continuous deposition from the Turonian ‚Äì Campanian. The Cemaller is overlain by the siltstone and limestone of the Ba√æk√∂y Formation. The Dinlence Formation overlies the Cemaller and consists of andesites and andesitic tuffites. It is possible that the Dinlence is the Yemislicay Formation since it too contains andesites and andesitic tuffites. The Dinlence is overlain by the marls, and limestones of the Alap√Ω Formation. Tectonic history Paleozoic During the middle Paleozoic, the Zonguldak basin was part of the south-facing passive margin of the Laurasian plate.Goncuoglu, M.C. and Kozlu, H. (2000). Early Paleozoic evolution of the NW Gondwanaland: Data from southern Turkey and surrounding regions. Gondwana Research, 3, 315-324 During the Carboniferous, the temperature of the sediment water interface was near 25 ¬∞C and heat flow into the Zonguldak basin was about 1.3 heat flow units (HFU). Backstripping analysis of the Alacaagzi Formation, the lowest coal-bearing formation, reaches a maximum temperature and depth of 100 ¬∞C and 2.4 km, respectively, in the Zonguldak area during the Carboniferous. Similarly, the base of the Kozlu Formation reaches maximum temperatures of 85, 85, and 100 ¬∞C in the Armutcuk, the Zonguldak, and the Amasra regions, respectively.Yal√ßin M.N., ƒ∞nan, S., G√ºlbin, G., Mann, U., and Schaefer, R.G (2002). Carboniferous coals of the Zonguldak basin (northwest Turkey): Implications for coalbed methane potential. American Association of Petroleum Geologists bulletin, 86 (7), 1305-1328 The Zonguldak basin was tectonically active during the late Paleozoic and this strongly influenced its structural and burial history due to the Hercynian orogeny. The Hercynian orogeny was the result of the continent‚Äìcontinent collision between Laurasia and Gondwana. This collision created many E-NE/W-SW striking faults, folds, and tilted the Paleozoic sediments. This uplift of the basin, near the end of the Westphalian, halted deposition and created the angular unconformity at the top of the Karadon Formation. Heat flow remained constant in the Zonguldak basin during the Hercynian Orogeny, while the uplift decreased the temperatures the sediments experienced. For example, at the end of the Permian the top of the Alacaagzi was roughly 70 ¬∞C and 1.6 km below the sediment surface in the Zonguldak area. Mesozoic During the Cretaceous, the Zonguldak basin experienced general subsidence, rifting, and faulting. This led to another period of deposition in the region and faulted the coal seams. This faulting provided a pathway for meteoric water to enter the coal seams. During the Aptian, the Intrapontide Ocean, the ocean separating the Western Pontides tectonic region of Turkey form the Sakarya Continent, underwent subduction. This led to the formation of a back arc basin, the Black Sea. The start of this subduction is responsible for the unconformity between the Kilimi and Cemaller formations and marks the beginning of the Alpide orogeny in the region. The andesitic volcaniclastic sediments of the Yemislicay support the subduction of oceanic crust in the region during this time. The Zonguldak basin was able to sustain deposition after the start of the Alpide orogeny due to rifting in the Black Sea basin. The rifting in the Black Sea also increased heat flow into the Zonguldak basin during the Cretaceous. Heat flows were as high as 1.5‚Äì1.75 HFU, and the temperature of the sediment water interface was about 25 ¬∞C. Cenozoic The Intra-Pontide Ocean stopped subducting with the collision between the Western Pontides terrain and the Eastern Pontides terrain. The Aplide orogeny stopped deposition and uplifted the Zonguldak basin during the Eocene epoch beginning at 42 Ma. The coal bearing formations experienced the highest temperatures at the onset of the Alpide orogeny. For example, the base of the Kozlu Fm experienced temperatures of 125, 175, and 140 ¬∞C in the Armutcuk, the Zonguldak, and the Amasra regions, respectively. The Alpide tectonic provinces in Anatolia, from north to south, are the Pontides, Anatolides, Tarides, and Border Folds. These provinces have roughly an east‚Äìwest strike. The Zonguldak basin is currently being uplifted by the Alpide orogeny. Progressively older sediments outcrop toward the north of the basin. Source rock Coals The coals of the Alacaagzi, Kozlu, and Karadon formations are of bituminous rank.Y√ºr√ºm, Y., Bozkurt, D., and Yal√ßin, M.N. (2001). Change of the structure of coals from the Kozlu K20 G borehole of Zonguldak Basin with Burial Depth: 1. chemical structure. Energy Sources, 23, 511-520 The Alacaagzi, Kozlu, and Karadon formations contain greater than 70%, 81%, and 81% total organic carbon (TOC), respectively. Structure The coals of the Zonguldak basin follow the mean evolution of type III kerogens. The coals of the Zonguldak basin show vitrinite reflectances (Ro) of 0.45‚Äì1.70%. Ho≈üg√∂rmez et al. (2002) determined that the coals of the Kozlu formation exhibit Ro of 1.0‚Äì1.2%, which gives them a coal rank of high volatile A bituminous.StrƒÖpoƒá, D., Mastalerz, M., Dawson, K., Macalady, J., Callaghan, A.V., Wawrik, B., Turich, C. and Ashby, M. (2011). Biogeochemistry of microbial coal-bed methane. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 39, 617-656 Additionally, coalification increased with depth, and the coals became more aromatic with depth.Karayigit, A.I., Gayer, R.A., and Demirel, I.H. (1998). Coal rank and petrography of Upper Carboniferous coal seams (Amasra, Turkey). International Journal of Coal Geology, 38, 277-294 The calorification of the coals also increased with depth. Methane The two broad scale pathways of methane production, thermogenic and biogenic generation, account for the majority of methane generation in coals. Thermogenic production of methane in coals begins at temperatures around 80 ¬∞C and peaks around 0.7‚Äì1.6% of vitrinite reflectance. Biogenic generation of methane takes place through two chemically distinguishable pathways. These pathways are carbon dioxide reduction and acetate fermentation and methanol/methyl utilization. Typically, biogenic production takes place early in the maturation of a coal bed, since the temperatures observed during the coalification process are high enough for sterilization. A coal bed may produce methane later in its history if it is uplifted and fractured. The uplifting of the beds cools them enough for colonization by microbes and fractures and faults provide inoculation pathways by the infiltration of surface water. The coals of the Zonguldak basin were subjected to a complex depositional and tectonic history, and this influenced the basins methane generation. The Alacaagzi formation did not pass the 80 ¬∞C isotherm until it had been buried for 25 Ma. The Kozlu formation experienced two different conditions during its first 260 Ma. The bottom of the Kozlu was mostly below the 80 ¬∞C isotherm while the top of the formation was above it. With deposition in the Cretaceous, the Kozlu formation was buried beneath the 80 ¬∞C Isotherm. The Alacaagzi and Kozlu were uplifted past the 80 ¬∞C around 5 Ma. At this point the rocks had been fractured and meteoric water could inoculate the system with methanogenic microbes. Isotopic data from wells in the Zonguldak basin suggest that the methane is primarily thermogenic in nature. There may have been some initial microbial methane generation in the coal beds or generation after the basin had been uplifted and meteoric water could enter the beds. Reinoculation is supported by the evidence of isotopically lighter gas occurring near cleats in the coal beds. Shales The organic rich shales of the Yilani contain up to 7.9% TOC, and the shales and siltstones of the coalbearing formations can contain 2‚Äì26% TOC. The organic matter is found as type II kerogen. While the Yilani entered the gas window, isotopic data suggest that most of the gas in the basin was derived from the Kozlu coal deposits and the associated organic rich shales. Summary of source rock The predominant source rock in the Zonguldak basin is coal. The most prolific source rock is the Kozlu Formation, containing the greatest volume of coal and the greatest amount of methane. This is in corroboration with the Ro values that suggest thermogenic production of methane in the Zonguldak basin would have been high. Methane generated by shale may be contributing a small amount to the total amount of methane found in the basin, but the majority is coal derived. Coal-derived methane appears to be mostly thermogenic in origin with some biogenic production. Reservoir Coal Coal is the primary reservoir lithology in the Zonguldak basin. Coal, since it is a solid hydrocarbon, cannot migrate. Coal is also an important reservoir lithology in the basin for methane. Methane in coal beds is primarily found in a sorbed state, while a very small fraction is found as a free gas. The gas is in the microporous structure of the coal at near liquid densities. Ho≈üg√∂rmez et al. (2002) estimated that the coals of the Zongulak basin contain up to 12 cm3 g‚àí1 of methane. Additionally, 90% of the methane in the Karadon Formation is adsorbed to the coal while 10% of it is found as free gas. The total volume of coal bed methane in the Karadon Formation in the Amasra region has been estimated to be 862.5‚Äì2600 million cubic metres. Other units The dolomites of the Yilani Formation are characterized as potential reservoir units. The sandstone units in the Alacaagzi, Kozlu, and Karadon formations are also potential reservoirs. Another formation with good reservoir qualities is the Yemislicay or Dinlence Formation. The base of the Yemislicay is characterized by a red pelagic limestone interlain with volcaniclastic sediments. Seals Due to the microporous nature of coal, coal is a significant seal in the Zonguldak basin. Outside of the coal-bearing formations, the only other formation that can serve as a seal is the Kilimli Formation. Coal mines Coal mines include Armut√ßuk coal mine and Karadon coal mine.

Besides details about her parents, marriage, and conduct as a daughter and wife, the work also records the confessions of faith (supposedly verbatim) that she spoke before her death. It also includes her dying farewells to family and friends. The text ends with her dying greetings to Christ.  Personal life  Katherine Stubbes was born Katherine Emmes in either 1570 or 1571, the second-youngest child, and only daughter, of seven.Stubbes, Philip. \\"A chrystall glasse for Christian women.\\" p. 1. https://www.amazon.com/chrystall-Christian-Containing-excellent- fourteenth/dp/1240943350Mascuch, Michael.

Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1997. p. 56 Her father, William Emmes,Mascuch, p. 56 was a cordwainer and a zealous Puritan; her mother was Dutch and a Puritan as well, so Katherine was raised in a very religious household.Stubbes, p. 1 Katherine was married to Philip Stubbs, an English pamphleteer and publisher, in 1586 at the age of fifteen.Travitsky, Betty. The Paradise of Women: Writings by Englishwomen of the Renaissance. New York: Columbia University Press, 1989. p. 45. Katherine‚Äôs father had already died by that time.Stubbes, p. 1 Mr. Stubbs had \\"recently gained some notoriety by rebuking the world, and England in particular, for its backsliding with his tract The Anatomy of Abuses,\\" but, because of her father‚Äôs death, she most likely had to be married off quickly for financial reasons.Mascuch, p. 56 In A Chrystall Glasse, Katherine's husband praises her as being very pious, courteous and obedient. She was not prone to indulge in eating or drinking, saying \\"we should eate to live, & not live to eate.\\"Stubbes, p. 3 When asked why she had so little care for earthly things, she would say that to be \\"a friend unto this world‚Ä¶should be an enemie unto God.\\"Stubbes, p. 3-4 Katherine also never lied or quarreled, and even kept herself far from any unscrupulous behavior and talk, let alone speak as such herself.Banerjee, Pompa. Burning women: widows, witches, and early modern European travelers in India. Early Modern Cultural Studies, 1500-1700. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. p. 177 Her husband claims that no one ever spoke any bad words about her, for they would have no cause to, \\"so continently she lived.\\"Stubbes, p. 3 As a deeply religious and extremely pious woman, much of Katherine's short life revolved around religion and Scripture. Her husband mentions that one almost never saw her without a Bible (or another \\"good book\\") in her hands. If she was not actively reading the Bible, she was discussing and reasoning the word of God with her husband.Stubbes, p. 2 Katherine lived with her husband for almost four-and-a-half years,Stubbes, p. 1 at which time she became pregnant with a son.Stubbes, p. 4 She would often say that this child would be her last, and that she would only \\"live but to bring that Childe into the world.\\"Stubbes, p. 4 Despite this, she had a very successful delivery‚Äîin fact, she reportedly was able to sit up and walk on her own only four or five days after the fact.Stubbes, p. 4 Katherine‚Äôs saying \\"I have but a short time to live here [on Earth]\\",Stubbes, p. 4 though it may have been added posthumously by her husband, turned out to be rather accurate. After she had seemed to have a full recovery, she fell seriously ill with ague and languished in her bed, not sleeping for more than an hour at a time, though she had \\"perfect understanding, sense, and memory to the last breath.\\"Stubbes, p. 4 She did not pray for her recovery, but to die so she could be with the Lord in Heaven; she constantly prayed for Jesus to take her out of her mortal body.Stubbes, p. 5 During her final sickness, Katherine \\"requested that her neighbors be brought into her home so that she might confess publicly.\\"Travitsky, p. 44 Katherine died on 14 December 1590, a few weeks after her son was born, in Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire. She was only 19 years old.  A Chrystall Glasse for Christian Women  The title page of A Chrystall Glasse Katherine‚Äôs husband first published A Chrystall Glasse in 1592, two years after her death.Travitsky, p. 45 The biography praises Katherine quite highly: according to Mr. Stubbs, she was a very good, pious woman, and should be held up as a mirror of womanhood, hence the title of the work. The full text on the title page is as follows:Stubbes, p. 1 :A Chrystall Glasse for Christian Women. :Containing a most excellent Discourse of the Godly Life and Christian Death of Mistris Katherine Stubs, who departed this life in Burton upon Trent in Stafford-shire, the fourteenth of December. :With a most heavenly confession of the Christian Faith, which shee made a little before her departure, as also a most wonderfull combat betwixt Satan, and her Soule: worthy to be printed in letters of Gold, and to be engraven in the Table of everie Christian heart. :Set downe word for word as she spake, as neere as could bee gathered, by Philip Stubbes, Gent. :Revel.14.verse 13. Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord: even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them. After a brief few pages about Katherine‚Äôs life, the text goes into detail about her death: that and her confessions of faith soon before her death make up the bulk of A Chrystall Glasse.Mascuch, p. 57 The section of Katherine‚Äôs confession of faith, entitled ‚ÄúA moste heavenly confession of the Christian faith, made by the blessed servant of God Mistris Katherine Stubbes, a little before she dyed‚Äù represents Katherine‚Äôs own religious creed, which mirrors the doctrine of the Elizabethan church.Mascuch, p. 59 After that, in ‚ÄúA most wonderfull conflict betwixt Sathan and her soule, and of her valiant conquest in the same, by the power of Christ,‚Äù she argues with Satan, who seemed to have appeared before her, and she eventually vanquishes him. In her dying moments, she sings a psalm and asks her husband not to mourn her‚Äîthen, ‚Äúher breath stayed, and so moving neither hand nor foot she slept sweetly in the Lord.‚ÄùStubbes, p. 22  Criticism  Although A Chrystall Glasse is a biography, numerous scholars and critics agree that it is not one that is completely unbiased and without motives. Insight into the text can be obtained by reading from economic, religious, and feminist perspectives. Philip Stubbs, as the author of the work, sets himself up as the narrator, giving the feel of objectivity.Aughterson, Kate. Renaissance woman: a sourcebook: constructions of femininity in England. New York: Routledge, 1995. p. 1-2 However, even though it claims to have copied her work verbatim, we cannot know that for sure, since the text is not written down by the woman herself: she is merely represented by her husband.Malcolmson, Cristina, and Suzuki, Mihoko. Debating gender in early modern England, 1500-1700. Early Modern Cultural Studies, 1500-1700. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. p. 142 The work is seen as an exaggerated portrayal of Katherine,Brayman Hackel, Heidi & Kelly, Catherine E. Reading women: literacy, authorship, and culture in the Atlantic world, 1500-1800. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008. p. 15 which indicates that her husband had further motivation for publishing the work than simply as a dedication to her memory‚ÄîKatherine was meant to be a model of the ideal early modern Protestant woman.Lemon, Rebecca, Mason, Emma, Roberts, Jonathan, & Rowland, Christopher. The Blackwell companion to the Bible in English literature. Chichester: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2009. p. 169Aughterson, p. 2 From an economic perspective, in the age of emergent capitalism, Katherine was also held up by her husband as a contrast and critique of the ‚Äúbourgeois women consumers who offered her a world of goods‚Äîfine food, prideful apparel, and plays.‚ÄùBrayman Hackel & Kelly, p. 15 Primarily, godly and pious women were meant to emulate Katherine‚Äôs strong religious faith and piety, which included the practice of ‚Äúobsessive Bible reading.‚ÄùLemon, et al., p. 169 As a public speaker, she also places herself as an active member of the religious community.Aughterson, p. 3 Religion, of course, also has strong ties to death, and Katherine‚Äôs confessions and discussion of death were not uncommon themes in the discourse of early modern women.Malcolmson & Suzuki, p. 142 Stubbes‚Äô speeches have been compared with Rachel Speght‚Äôs Mortalities Memorandum, with A Dream Prefixed (1621) and Alice Sutcliffe‚Äôs Meditations of Man‚Äôs Mortalitie (1634), since all three give rise to discussion about the question of the woman‚Äôs voice.Malcolmson & Suzuki, p. 143 When reading A Chrystall Glasse from a feminist perspective, one way the text can be seen is as evidence of Katherine‚Äôs ‚Äúinternalisation of the ideology of womanhood.‚ÄùAughterson, p. 2 As the ‚Äòmirror of womanhood‚Äô from an early modern European perspective, the text suggests that Katherine seemed to live vicariously through her husband: everything he felt, she felt as well.Banerjee, p. 115 Despite the fact that Katherine seems the perfect model of Christian womanhood, one can also see gaps between the various descriptions of her in A Chrystall Glasse. For example, she is described as an ‚Äúactive and intelligent disputer against Catholics and atheists: ‚Äòshe would not yield a jot, nor give place to them at all, but would most mightily justify the truth of God against their blasphemous untruths, and convince them.‚Äô‚ÄùAughterson, p. 2-3 Despite this, Mr. Stubbs goes on to say that Katherine was the very model of the ‚Äòsilent woman,‚Äô and would engage in ‚Äútheological questioning only in private at home‚Ä¶‚Äòshe obeyed the commandment of the apostle who biddeth women be silent, and to learn of their husbands at home.‚Äô‚ÄùAughterson, p. 3 She also showed assertion in other ways: on her deathbed, she specifically expresses to her husband her wishes for her child‚Äôs education.Aughterson, p. 3 The apparent disparity between the descriptions and rhetoric of Katherine Stubbs causes A Chrystall Glasse to become a text where ‚Äúwomen can find not just a model of the ideal woman, but also ways of, and places for, articulating specific roles and powers which are not explicitly part of the dominant ideology.‚ÄùAughterson, p. 4 Even so, others argue that the text can be seen not simply a struggle against ‚Äúrestrictive masculine discourses‚Ä¶but as an affirmation of more numerous‚Ä¶discursive options for early modern women.‚ÄùMalcolmson & Suzuki, p. 142 In any case, considering that A Chrystall Glasse had 34 editions from 1591 to 1700,Banerjee, p. 115 it must have resonated strongly with society throughout the early modern period.

It had an estimated magnitude of 8.1 on the scale and triggered a destructive tsunami. It badly affected the northern coast of Haiti and part of what is now the Dominican Republic. Port-de-Paix suffered the greatest damage from both earthquake and tsunami. Approximately 5,000 people were killed by the effects of the earthquake shaking and another 300 by the tsunami. Tectonic setting The island of Hispaniola lies across the complex transform plate boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The overall four cm per year displacement along this boundary is split nearly equally between two major dextral (right lateral) strike-slip zones either side of the Gon√¢ve Microplate. To the south is the Enriquillo‚ÄìPlantain Garden fault zone, which extends from Jamaica in the west to the south-east of Hispaniola to the east. In the north the fault zone is the Septentrional- Oriente fault zone passing along the southern margin of Cuba and along the northern part of Hispaniola. Both of these fault zones have been associated with several major historical earthquakes. Earthquake The earthquake was felt over a wide area, including southern Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and across the Antilles. The estimated intensity reached IX (violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale along the northern coast from Cap-Ha√Øtien to Santiago de los Caballeros. The earthquake appears to have been caused by movement on the Septentrional Fault, with the rupture extending from the Cibao valley in the present day Dominican Republic, along the whole of the northern coast of Haiti. Tsunami The tsunami affected the northern coast of Haiti and present day Dominican Republic. The highest run-up of 4.6 m was observed at Port-de-Paix, with 2 m run-ups seen along much of the northern coast. At Saint John in the United States Virgin Islands, the run-up was 3.1 m. Damage The ruins of the Sans-Souci Palace, severely damaged in the earthquake and never rebuilt The region that suffered the greatest damage was the northern Cape area, although there was significant damage along the northern coast as far as Santiago de los Caballeros (now in the Dominican Republic). The towns of Cap- Ha√Øtien, Port-de-Paix, M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas and Fort-Libert√© were also severely affected. Henri Christophe's Sans-Souci Palace was badly damaged and was never rebuilt. At Port-de-Paix, the sea drew back 60 m, before returning and flooding the city in 5 m of water, killing between 200-300 of the inhabitants. The effect of the tsunami at M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas was catastrophic, leaving almost none of the town standing. Aftermath Despite the devastation caused by the earthquake President Boyer did not visit the affected areas and this led to an increase in opposition to his rule. The chaos also allowed groups allied to Juan Pablo Duarte to link up with others opposed to Boyer. Future seismic hazard The results of trenching across the Septentrional Fault in the Ciabo valley have identified large earthquakes, similar in character to that in 1842, at around 1230 and another historical event in 1562. Assuming that these earthquakes were caused by displacement on the same segment of the fault, a recurrence interval of about 300 years is indicated, similar to that proposed for the Enriquillo fault in the southern part of the island.

In 2009, she announced her plan to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe single-handed. A Dutch court stepped in, owing to the objections of the local authorities, and prevented Laura from departing while under shared custody of both her parents. In July 2010, a Dutch family court ended this custody arrangement, and the record- breaking attempt finally began on 21 August 2010. Dekker successfully completed the solo circumnavigation in a 12.4-metre (40 ft) two-masted ketch named Guppy, arriving in Simpson Bay, Sint Maarten, 518 days later at the age of 16.  Early life  Dekker was born in the city of Whangarei, New Zealand, during a seven-year sailing trip by her parents. Her father, Dick Dekker, is Dutch and her mother, Babs M√ºller, is German. Dekker has Dutch, German, and New Zealand citizenship. Her parents divorced in 2001. She lived with her father after the separation of her parents, and her younger sister Kim went to live with her mother. Dekker spent the first five years of her life at sea and sailed often with her father after the family's return to the Netherlands. She has owned several boats, all named Guppy. The first was an Optimist dinghy she received for her sixth birthday, and which she promptly learned to sail solo, initially accompanied by her father on a windsurfer. For her eighth birthday (in 2003), she received the book Maiden Voyage, Tania Aebi's memoir of her round-the-world sailing trip. In the summer of 2006, after assisting her father in a 24-hour sailing race aboard a friend's Hurley 700, she received permission from the boat's owner to borrow it for personal use, in return for cleaning and maintenance. It was just at the limit below which Dutch law imposes on captains under the age of 16. Sailing it often, she christened this boat Guppy as well. In the summer of 2007, she took it on a more ambitious 6-week sailing tour of the Wadden Sea, accompanied by her dog Spot. Over the following winter, Dekker searched for her own Hurley 700, and bought one with a loan from her father. This boat was also christened Guppy, and she spent her entire 2008 summer vacation aboard it, cruising around the Netherlands.  2009 trip to England  Over the following school year, she began preparing herself and Guppy for open-ocean sailing, with the goal of a round-the-world tour. In March, her father told her to gain some experience with the open sea by first sailing to England. This was intended to discourage her; the strong currents, rough weather, and heavy shipping make the English Channel notoriously difficult for sailboats. Dekker spent the next eight weeks preparing Guppy for that trip. On the evening of Friday, 1 May, at the beginning of a 12-day school vacation, she sailed away from Maurik without specifying a destination to her father. She sailed to the coast and arrived in Maassluis Saturday afternoon. Early Sunday morning, she set out across the Channel, but weak winds delayed her arrival until Monday morning. Docking in Lowestoft, she e-mailed word of her success from a local library. Local authorities requested her father to come and accompany her on her return voyage. Her father responded that she could sail back on her own. Local authorities instead placed her in a children's home until he came to retrieve her. He returned her to her boat and then flew home. She left England on Monday, 11 May. With a strong wind this time, up to force 7, the return trip was much faster, reaching Rotterdam by the morning of the 12th and arriving home that evening.  Plans for a global circumnavigation  In August 2009, Dekker announced her plan for a two-year solo sailing voyage around the globe in the Dutch national newspaper, Algemeen Dagblad. Her father was in support of her plans. Dekker planned to sail a seagoing Jeanneau Gin Fizz ketch, also named Guppy. The boat was equipped for long-distance sailing and adapted for solo-circumnavigation. The planned route started from Portugal westwards, to cruise the Caribbean and then to go through Panama and past Indonesia. She then planned either to go past Somalia to the Mediterranean, or around Africa, should piracy become a serious concern. Her plan was to make around 26 stops. The original plan called for Dekker to be met at some locations by family, which also would help her along difficult spots such as the Panama Canal. In actuality, for cost reasons, people from home (mostly family members) met her only two times, although she was given some assistance by other leisure sailors she met, for example through the Panama Canal. The plan said she would not be sailing for more than three weeks between stops. However, after Australia, she decided to skip some stops, which meant completing two 6- to 7-week-long legs. An Iridium Satellite LLC tracking system onboard allowed the family in the Netherlands to monitor her course closely. She planned to avoid the stormy Roaring Forties, although the South Africa route gave her at least one big storm. Her education was conducted through the Wereldschool (Worldschool), an educational institution that provided her with material for self-learning. From the beginning of her solo circumnavigation in late August 2010, Laura wrote a weekly column for the Algemeen Dagblad of Rotterdam. English and German translations of her columns are available.  Government objections  The local authorities at Wijk bij Duurstede, her place of residence, objected and the Child Welfare Office became involved. A family court judgment was obtained that placed Dekker in shared parental custody with the Council for Child Care who stopped her departure. The shared custody was to last until July 2010, but a successful application by the child protection agency saw that extended until at least August of that year. Dekker's plan and the intervention by the government received extensive international attention. According to Dutch inland shipping regulations, it is prohibited for a captain younger than sixteen years to sail a boat longer than seven meters in Dutch waters; thus Dekker would not be allowed to use the boat for any solo excursions within the Netherlands until 2012. She still did so, with the effect that the police required her father to come and sail the boat home together with her. The circumnavigation, however, would not start in the Netherlands, thus Dutch naval regulations do not apply to her voyage. On 18 December 2009, a member of Dekker's family reported her missing to the police. A farewell letter was left for her father, although her boat remained in the port of Maurik. On 20 December, Dekker was found safely on Sint Maarten. Two days later, she returned to Amsterdam where she was questioned by the police. On 26 December 2009, it was reported that another court in the Netherlands overruled the objections of the social workers and permitted her to begin her circumnavigation in September of the following year when she turned 15. On 27 July 2010, the Dutch court ended supervision of Dekker, and decided it was \\"up to the girl's parents to decide whether she can make the trip.\\" Dekker reported that she would depart \\"within two weeks\\". Dekker later commented about the authorities in an interview, saying \\"They thought it was dangerous. Well, everywhere is dangerous. They don't sail and they don't know what boats are, and they are scared of them.\\" While in Australia, Dekker gave an interview in which she admitted that she was not doing much schoolwork since she was busy with sailing, maintenance, customs procedures and other tasks related to her journey. This led to press and other commentators suggesting that she had quit school and thrown the school books overboard. She tried to correct this by saying that she had not stopped studying totally and would continue her academic studies after returning to the Netherlands. On 14 October 2011, Dekker was nominated for the Conny van Rietschoten Trophy, a very prestigious Dutch sailing award, in the ocean sailing category. Preceding Dekker's journey, the sailing press appeared rather sceptical, but became more positive during the journey, and acclaimed her after the Indian Ocean crossing and the Cape of Good Hope passage. General media in countries she visited have often also been impressed, at least on later stages. General media in the Netherlands mostly avoided writing about her during the journey, since the journey went mostly as planned. An exception was the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad which had a weekly column about her and displayed a standing link on the front web page to a collection of articles about the teenage sailor. However, on 4 January 2012, Dutch and German press started to write much more about her, both about the fact that she soon was expected to finish the circumnavigation, and about the fact that she did not want to return to the Netherlands, but to settle in New Zealand. After the arrival on 21 January 2012, there were articles in newspapers all over the world.  Boat  Yacht Guppy in Den Osse, Netherlands, on 3 August 2010 Dekker used a French-built two-masted Jeanneau Gin Fizz ketch, A detailed description of Guppy as fitted for the trip. which Laura named Guppy, same as her earlier boats.  2010‚Äì2011 solo circumnavigation  Dekker sailed from Den Osse, Netherlands, on 4 August 2010, headed for Portugal. This segment did not constitute part of the solo circumnavigation, as her father was on board to coach her and test the new boat. The published plan was that the solo voyage would commence from Lisbon. Instead, Dekker and her father sailed to Portim√£o, arriving on 15 August. She sailed with others from Portim√£o to Gibraltar on 18‚Äì20 August, because according to Portuguese law, she was too young to be formally qualified to captain her ship (Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory subject to British law, though Dekker made her departure from Gibraltar in secret in order to avoid both the press and any maritime police). 2010‚Äì2012 Solo circumnavigation progress: *Departed Gibraltar on 21 August 2010. *Arrived at Lanzarote on 25 August. *Stayed in the Canary Islands for several weeks because of the Atlantic hurricane season. *Departed Gran Canaria on 10 November for Cape Verde. *Commenced Atlantic crossing from Cape Verde to Sint Maarten‚Äîa distance of ‚Äîon 2 December; finished when she reached Simpson Bay Lagoon on 19 December; having encountered calm weather on this leg of her journey, used the engine for two days in order to arrive on time. *Served as crew member for ten days on the tall ship Stad Amsterdam, departing from St. Maarten on 5 January 2011. *Departed Sint Maarten on 20 January; visited the islands of √éles des Saintes, Dominica, Bonaire and San Blas Islands, all located in the Caribbean. *Flew home on 27 February; stayed to 10 March to speak at a boat show and other places, now a figure of considerable media attention in the Netherlands. *Completed the passage of the Panama Canal on 11 April 2011; visited Pearl Islands thereafter. *Crossed the Equator on the evening of 25 April; reached the Gal√°pagos Islands the following day. *Departed the Gal√°pagos Islands on 7 May and arrived at Hiva Oa, Marquesas Islands on 25 May, having sailed about in 18 days, the longest leg so far; encountered open sea only, with no islands near the route. *Sailed from Marquesas Islands to Tahiti between 1 and 8 June, a journey of ; demanding leg of the journey with shifting winds, many reefs, ships, and little sleep. *Visited Moorea and Bora Bora, and then sailed the journey to Vava ªu, Tonga in 12 days, where she arrived 8 July. *Arrived 17 July 2011 at Suva, Fiji, having sailed for four days, and on 30 July at Port Vila, Vanuatu after having sailed for three days. *Sailed from Vanuatu on 8 August, heading for Darwin, Australia; arrived in Darwin on 25 August after one of the toughest legs of her journey, which included passage through Torres Strait, filled with reefs, islands and large ships; father visited her in Darwin, their first meeting since she had visited the Netherlands in March 2011; together, undertook a major overhaul of the boat; celebrated Dekker's 16th birthday. *Departed Darwin on 25 September, heading west; published information about this leg of her journey in her blog following about two weeks delay, because of security concerns regarding Indian Ocean pirates. *Sailed to Durban, South Africa, arriving 12 November, after 47 days at sea non-stop; reported wind varying from dead calm to hard wind that often shifted direction; sometimes encountered rough waves (distance Darwin‚ÄìDurban is ). *Arrived at Port Elizabeth, South Africa, on 18 November. *Passed Cape Agulhas, South Africa, on 26 November, southernmost point on the African continent, and southernmost point of her journey; sailed thereafter a northerly course for the first time on her journey from the Netherlands. *Passed the Cape of Good Hope on 27 November in rough weather; reached Cape Town the same day; father and journalists and the boats of the Volvo Ocean Race met her there. *Sailed from Cape Town on 12 December, heading northwest. *Reached the longitude of her unofficial starting point in the Netherlands on 20 December; had already crossed all longitudes in the course of her circumnavigation; faced another for her official completion. *Arrived in Simpson Bay on Sint Maarten on 21 January 2012 at approximately 3 p.m. local time, after a non-stop journey of from Cape Town, thus completing her full circumnavigation of the world, at the age of 16 years, 123 days..

Guppys fate A February 2018 interview with the American Sailing Association announced \\"Dekker has donated her beloved Guppy, the very boat she did the trip on, to LifeSail.\\" LifeSail is a Los Angeles non-profit organisation that uses sailing as a vehicle to teach life lessons to children.https://www.lifesail.org On 20 August 2018, Dekker announced that Guppy was wrecked on a reef in the Pacific Ocean by LifeSail during its trip to Los Angeles. The boat was a total loss. LifeSail released a public statement in March 2019 with a timeline of eventshttps://www.lifesail.org/blog/delivery-and-loss-of-guppy that stated Ms. Dekker originally donated Guppy as a requirement to receive funds from a third party. Those funds would be used for her new boat, Guppy XL. Laura Dekker blames LifeSail and Matt Schulz, alleging they broke their contract by sailing the vessel with inexperienced crew and mooring in unsafe locations. She claimed compensation for the loss of Guppy, as the donation contract with LifeSail specified that in the case of a total loss all insurance compensation would go to her, less any value added by LifeSail.  Personal life  On 28 March 2015, when she was 19, Dekker married Daniel Thielmann, also resident in New Zealand.

The planet of Wa- Tor Wa-Tor is usually implemented as a two-dimensional grid with three colours, one for fish, one for sharks and one for empty water. If a creature moves past the edge of the grid, it reappears on the opposite side. The sharks are predatory and eat the fish. Both sharks and fish live, move, reproduce and die in Wa-Tor according to the simple rules defined below. From these simple rules, complex emergent behavior can be seen to arise. Excerpts from a Wa-Tor simulation. Fish are shown in green, sharks in blue. Predators and prey The balance of this ecosystem is very delicate: the populations of two species can follow hugely different cycles depending on the given parameters (such as reproduction cycles and the time period in which a shark must eat to avoid starvation) as well as starting positions of each being. It may go from both species being endangered to an abundance of one or both. When the prey are numerous, predators can reproduce rapidly. But this increase in turn increases the number of prey hunted and the population of the prey decreases. When the prey becomes rarer, predators begin to starve and die of starvation, decreasing their population and easing the hunting pressure on the prey. The prey (and in time predator) can then go back to rapidly reproducing as the cycle repeats itself. Rules An overview of the rules governing creatures on Wa-Tor. For the fish #At each chronon, a fish moves randomly to one of the adjacent unoccupied squares. If there are no free squares, no movement takes place. #Once a fish has survived a certain number of chronons it may reproduce. This is done as it moves to a neighbouring square, leaving behind a new fish in its old position. Its reproduction time is also reset to zero. For the sharks #At each chronon, a shark moves randomly to an adjacent square occupied by a fish. If there is none, the shark moves to a random adjacent unoccupied square. If there are no free squares, no movement takes place. #At each chronon, each shark is deprived of a unit of energy. #Upon reaching zero energy, a shark dies. #If a shark moves to a square occupied by a fish, it eats the fish and earns a certain amount of energy. #Once a shark has survived a certain number of chronons it may reproduce in exactly the same way as the fish. Possible results In the long run there are three possible scenarios in Wa-Tor: #A perfect balance between fish and sharks, which increase and decrease but never become extinct. #Disappearance of sharks. #Extinction of both species. The first scenario can be very difficult to obtain, where a kind of equilibrium is achieved in which the two populations fluctuate periodically. In most cases, the amount of fish is reduced to an almost endangered state, then the shark population rapidly falls due to shortage of food. This allows the fish population to grow again until the shark population can meet this growth. The extinction of both animals occurs when sharks exceed in number to a point where they eat all the fish. As the fish were the only source of food for sharks they will inevitably die of starvation. Conversely, if the initial number of fish is low, or the sharks have a very short period of starvation, the second scenario occurs. In this case the sharks will become extinct, leaving the field open to the fish.

Structural clay tile describes a category of burned-clay building materials used to construct roofing, walls, and flooring for structural and non-structural purposes, especially in fireproofing applications. Also called building tile, structural terra cotta, hollow tile, and clay block, the material is an extruded clay shape with substantial depth that allows it to be laid in the same manner as other clay or concrete masonry. In North America it was chiefly used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reaching peak popularity at the turn of the century and declining around the 1950s. Structural clay tile grew in popularity in the end of the nineteenth-century because it could be constructed faster, was lighter, and required simpler flat falsework than earlier brick vaulting construction. Each unit is generally made of clay or terra-cotta with hollow cavities, or cells, inside it. The material is commonly used in floor arches, fireproofing, partition walls, and furring. It continues to be used in Europe to build fire-resistant walls and partitions. In North America the material has largely been replaced by concrete masonry units.  History, Origins, and Development   Pre 1850s-1870s  Clay tile in different capacities has been used for thousands of years. The Romans were among the first to use clay tile in construction by building clay pots to lighten vaulting loads. However the first recorded structural use of terra- cotta forms was in sixth-century Italy in the dome of the Church of San Vitale in Ravenna. Clay pots lined with plaster of paris lightened the load of the dome in a similar way to earlier Roman construction.  1850s-1870s  alt=thumbAn example of a typical NATCO hollow clay tile as advertised in their 1910 catalogue. \\"The visible points of superiority, as compared with similar tile of different makes, are the deep dovetail scoring for the better bonding of stucco or plaster, the absence of imperfections and the better general symmetry due to the more accurate machining by this company's unequaled equipment. Equally important qualities not obtainable in other tile are not so apparent to the eye. These consist of finer properties in the raw clay and its more uniform and thorough burning, resulting in greater density and a higher degree of inherent strength. It is to certify these advantages, and to instantly identify the tile possessing them, that the name NATCO is stamped plainly upon the face of each tile.\\" ‚ÄîFrom NATCO Catalog \\"Fireproof Construction for Houses and Other Buildings at Moderate Cost,\\" 1910. The first recorded use of structural clay tile in the United States was in 1853. Frederick A. Peterson designed hand-shaped clay ovals that he placed between I-beams and covered with cement to create flooring. Peterson debuted his method in the Cooper Union Building in New York City. However, Peterson's method was not mass-produced or replicated until the 1870s. In 1871, Balthasar Kreischer and George H. Johnson patented a new method similar to Peterson's, based on earlier precedents including those of British architect Joseph Bunnett in 1858, as well as designs by Peterson. Each of these methods emerged out of a growing need to fireproof buildings following massive fires across the United States during that last quarter of the nineteenth century. Prior to the widespread use structural clay tile, brick and masonry construction dominated fireproofing techniques. However, brick and masonry construction, especially vaulting, was heavy, was time consuming to construct, and required the construction of costly custom formwork. Structural clay tile offered a lighter, faster, and simpler alternative. An interlocking system of angular clay tiles that were fit together with a keystone became popular in the early 1870s, after designs by Vincent Garcin were mass produced to create flat segmented arches. This flat segmented arch, developed by Garcin, was first used in the United States at the New York Post Office, Kendall Building in Chicago, and the Singer Manufacturing Building in St. Louis, becoming the most prolific use of hollow clay tile until the end of the century.  1880s-1900s  With its increased popularity, structural clay tile became one of the most popular materials for fireproofing iron and steel construction. However, its capacity for fireproofing was not fully realized until Peter Bonnett Wight invented the \\"tile shoe\\" in 1881. The \\"tile shoe\\" covered the exposed side of metal beams, fully insulating them from fire.  1910s-1950s  Flat arch construction grew in popularity with the increasing number of buildings using steel and iron structural members in their design. New building code requirements for fireproofing aided in the use and proliferation of structural clay tile in skyscrapers and other large buildings. After 1910, manufactures began to test and develop stronger and more complex structural clay tile systems that worked better in compression. Greater compressive strength, found largely in the invention of the end pressure arch, allowed the material to be used in longer floor spans. However, as reinforced concrete grew in popularity as a cheaper and less complex alternative, structural clay tile use in floors and roofing declined. Increasingly, clay tile was used inside concrete flooring to make it lighter, or as centering/formwork for concrete construction. With the rise of reinforced concrete flooring and metal decking, structural clay tile fell out of popularity for use in horizontal applications. While the use of structural clay tile in flooring and roofing declined, its use in walls enjoyed popularity into the 1950s. Wall tile blocks continue to be manufactured, but specialty tile units often require custom commissions. Clay tile arches are no longer manufactured and due to a lack of skilled artisans to lay the arch systems, they are never replaced. Horizontal Application  Tile Floor Arch Types  = Side Pressure Arch Construction = Side pressure arch construction, the first method used in tile floor arches, is composed of hollow tiles laid parallel to I beams. = End Pressure Arch Construction = End pressure arch construction is composed of hollow tiles laid perpendicular to I beams. This method enjoyed popularity after it was discovered to be fifty percent more efficient than side pressure arches.Electrical wiring being installed in structural clay tile block used for interior partitions in the vertical application, 2008.  Book Tile  A popular use of structural clay tile was book tile, a flat hollow tile, that was used in roofing systems. Book tile was also used in raised flooring to allow plumbing and other systems to be run in buildings.  Composite Construction  In the late 1890s, the most popular system of tile floor arches combined both side and end pressure construction. However, with the increase in popularity of concrete construction, composite construction began to use both methods in conjunction with reinforced concrete. Later systems used clay tiles and reinforced concrete to replace tile floor arches in the 1930s.  Vertical Application  The most popular and enduring form of structural clay tile is its use in vertical applications as a structural element. In the vertical application, structural clay tile blocks are used in both columns and load bearing walls. Likewise, structural clay tile blocks were frequently used as backing for exterior walls, often filling the voids behind architectural ornament, stone, or brickwork. In early steel construction, clay tile blocks were historically used as infill between structural members, which provided much needed lateral support. In some cases, entire walls‚Äîtypically in single-story buildings, seldom higher‚Äîwere created out of structural clay tile, typically multiple wythes thick. The cells of these blocks could be either unfilled or filled with reinforcing and grout.  Specialty Types  = Structural Glazed Facing Tiles = An example of a specialty type of hollow clay tile unit. This example interlocked with other units to increase strength, circa 1905. Structural glazed facing tile is perhaps its most common and prolific form of clay tile block. Structural glazed facing tile has been extensively used in institutional settings where a durable, easily cleanable surface is desired. The material is commonly found in schools, correctional facilities, swimming pools and similar facilities. A wide variety of shapes have been developed to allow the construction of corners, caps, wall base and other elements using standard sizes. SGFT cannot be easily cut without damage to the glazed surface, so several dozen special shapes are available to allow most situations to be accommodated. SGFT features a fired glazed surface that may be produced in colors similar to those available from standard ceramic tile. SGFT has been replaced in some applications by glazed masonry units, a composite of concrete masonry and a tile-like surface coating. Specialized kinds of structural clay tile were produced with a vitrified or glazed curved surface for use in building farm silos. Other shapes, called \\"telephone tiles\\", were used as underground multi- celled conduits for telephone cables.  Manufacturing and Classification   Manufacturing  Structural clay tile is still manufactured according to historical processes: clay is kneaded to an appropriate consistency, pressed into molds. and fired in large kilns. Different molds and forms are used for each type and shape of structural clay tile.  Classification  Structural clay tile is classified into three grades: hard, semi-porous, and porous. Each classification is differentiated by the length of time the tile is fired during the manufacturing process, and each classification is used for different purposes. Hard tile has the greatest structural strength of the three categories, and is used largely in applications where it is exposed to the elements. Its hardness resists moisture, as it is less porous than other classifications. However, hard tile is less fireproof as it is prone to cracking in high heat. Semi-porous tile has moderate strength and is resistant to moisture. Porous tile is made by mixing clay with straw, sawdust or other materials that are burned out during the manufacturing process making it highly porous and lighter, in addition to reducing structural dead loads. Porous tile was preferred among builders for fireproofing since it behaved well in high heat. Tile is classified into load-bearing and non-load-bearing categories. Load-bearing tile is described under ASTM Standard C34, subdivided into grade LBX, for areas exposed to weathering, and LB, for protected applications. Non-load-bearing tile is described under ASTM C56 in one grade, NB. It is used for interior partitions, and may be laid with cells running horizontally or vertically. Tile may be ribbed to accept a plaster finish, or smooth. Special shapes were available to attach to and to fit around structural steel shapes, providing a fire-resistant enclosure for the load- bearing steel members. Structural clay tiles are manufactured in a variety of standard sizes, including , , , and thicknesses, and typically x or x face dimensions. Tile was also manufactured in a series of graduated wedge shapes for installation between steel members as a fireproof flat arch floor structure, to be covered with a concrete wearing surface above. In other cases, structural clay tile was used as a permanent form material to reduce the bulk and weight of structural concrete floor slabs.

Russell Lake. The site consisted of a platform mound and an associated village site. Beaverdam Creek is thought to have been the center of a Mississippian culture simple chiefdom with a small resident population. The primary period of mound construction and village occupation dated to the regional Savannah period of the Middle Mississippian period, specifically 1200‚Äì1300 CE, with the site's abandonment occurring sometime after 1300. The mound was high, and its base measured by . The village boundaries were delineated as 15,000 square meters. Excavation *1969: The site was first observed professionally by Brooks Hutto, who reported that at least two decades of sustained looting by pot-hunters had damaged the mound and village site considerably. *1971: Joseph R. Caldwell of the University of Georgia conducted an eight-week field-school at the site, but a series of unpredictable and unfortunate events including dismal weather, pot-hunting raids by looters and the theft of equipment led to a disappointing excavation season. *1973: Chung Ho Lee, following the passing of Joseph R. Caldwell, wrote a report summarizing the 1971 excavations. Lee concluded that the mound was a multistage platform mound constructed during the Savannah period, and that ceremonial grave goods (including a copper-covered celt) were included in the mound. *1977: The Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology of the University of South Carolina conducted survey and testing that indicated a village midden was present and extended some from the mound. *1979: At the behest of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Thunderbird Research Corporation undertook to more accurately delineate the village boundaries through shovel tests, augering and limited excavation. *1980: Excavations by Gardner and Rappleye revealed early Lamar period (1375‚Äì1475 CE) material in the midden, and on this evidence proposed a primary use period for the site during this time. This conflicting hypothesis prompted them to recommend to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the mound be completely excavated, the village midden be extensively tested and that the floodplain to the north and southeast be thoroughly surveyed. *1980-1981: With funds provided by The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the University of Georgia Research Foundation, and the Archaeological Services Branch of the National Park Service began excavations as mitigation under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for the construction of the Richard B. Russell Dam and Reservoir. These excavations were led David J. Hally and James C. Rudolph, and created copious amounts of information concerning mound construction stages, subsistence, social structure as well as evidence for cooking, tool making, trash disposal and one possible village structure. Site description A diagram showing the various components of mound growth for a platform mound The mound construction stages show a growing complexity in social structure and hierarchy at the site. Beginning as a midden 15‚Äì20 cm thick, the mound grew through a succession of two earthlodge structures, a possible flooding event and four subsequent mound building stages. The earthlodges were superimposed square structures surrounded by significantly high earthen embankments. The interment of a high status individual, known as Burial 2, occurred prior to the construction of the second earthlodge after the partial dismantling of the first. These structures were then covered by a layer of water-lain sand that is interpreted as a possible flooding event. Following this, four separate platform-mound building events were recorded by Hally and Rudolph. The mounds were topped by free-standing structures of possible political/ceremonial importance. Mound Stage 2 also saw the addition of a wide ramp with the appearance of steps. There were 46 burials (16 adult females, 15 adult males, 13 children and 3 of indeterminate sex) excavated by Hally and Rudolph that exhibit marked differentiation of social status. Burial 2 was replete with grave goods. The inclusion of children into mound mortuary has been interpreted as evidence for ascribed status, and is considered a marker of increased hierarchical differentiation. Burial 2 grave goods included more than 7,000 mussel shell beads and a copper headpiece and ear spools. The well- preserved food remains excavated from village midden provides for a detailing of a diversified and generalized subsistence strategy rather that a more focal strategy employed by the inhabitants. The remains included resources from the upland and bottomland forest, river shoals, and agricultural practices on the fertile floodplain, and included maize, squash, sumpweed, sunflower, maypops, grapes, persimmons, acorns, hickory nuts, grass seeds and greens as floral resources, as well, as faunal resources such as deer, rabbits, squirrels, raccoons, beaver, turkey and riverine foods including turtle, catfish, gar, sucker and bass. The excavations conducted at Beaverdam Creek have helped to clarify two important categories of study in Mississippian period chiefdoms, namely how is a chiefdom quantified and what were subsistence strategies employed by a chiefdom once it has been quantified? The exchange of earthlodges for structures atop platform mounds coupled with Burial 2 and the inclusion of children argues for the emergence of the site as a stratified chiefdom, and the floral and faunal evidence indicate a highly diversified subsistence strategy.

During the 1960s and 1970s he wrote several long running and popular plays for comedians James Young and Jimmy Logan. His plays remain a favourite with Northern Ireland audiences and amateur theatre companies.  Life  Sam Cree was born in Lisburn on 19 February 1928, the son of Robert Campbell Cree and his wife Sarah (n√©e Hanna).Births Index, General Register Office of Northern Ireland, Belfast Early in his life he worked in a drawing office in Lisburn. Whilst there he was asked to do 'something entertaining' for the company's Christmas party. Cree wrote a sketch called A Day in the Life of a managing director. Cree would continue writing these sketches, much to the embarrassment of his co-workers. Driven by this success Cree submitted a sketch to comedian James Young for inclusion in his summer variety show. Young's business partner Jack Hudson claimed that it was the worst script he had ever read. The set required a street of houses, the dialogue unfunny and there was no Punch line. Young wrote to Cree and thanked him for his efforts. Rather than discourage Cree, Young suggested that Cree come to his next show to get a better idea of what was required. Cree took full advantage of Young's offer and kept the letter saying it was his first professional criticism. Cree's work would frequently appear in Young's shows from then on. Young would give Cree his sketch ideas and Cree would quickly turn the ideas into workable scripts. Following the withdrawal of Sam Thompson's play Over The Bridge from Ulster Group Theatre, Young was invited to bring his unique comedy talents to the venue. Young asked Cree to adapt Glenn Melvyn's The Love Match for an Ulster audience. The plot of Cree's adaption followed Alec Galbraith, a fanatical supporter of Linfield Football Club, whose son Davy joins rival team Glentoran. The play premiered on 8 March 1960 and ran for ten weeks. The play was a success and Young and Hudson became joint managing directors of the Group Theatre in Autumn 1960. To follow up on their success they asked Cree to pen a sequel to The Love Match. Cree obliged by writing Wedding Fever. The premiere of Wedding Fever was attended by the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Brookeborough and his wife, Belfast Lord Mayor Sir Robin Kinahan and other VIPs. Cree's play ran for 42 weeks and its success allowed the Group Theatre to clear its debt. An agent offered Cree ¬£500 to the rights to Wedding Fever. Cree didn't sell and later his plays were making up to ¬£3,000 a day. Following Wedding Fever, Cree sought success away from James Young. He wanted out from under Young's shadow and wanted to write without interference from the show's star. Cree wrote for Scottish comedian Jimmy Logan who appeared in numerous Cree sketches and his plays Cupid Wore Skirts, Married Bliss, Second Honeymoon and Wedding Fever. Cree was offered ¬£80,000 for his play Cupid Wore Skirts and during the height of his success he spent three weeks in Hollywood touring the Studios and meeting the likes of Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin and Liza Minnelli. Cree would also write for The Carry On films, George Formby and Arthur Askey. Cree's later plays premiered at the Arts Theatre, Belfast run by actor/manager Hubert R. \\"Hibbie\\" Wilmot. Following the start of The Troubles, however, most of the Theatres in Belfast went dark due to civil unrest. During this time Cree attempted to find success with a promotions business. However, he was not as successful as he had been as a playwright. Cree continued to write, however and even following the onset of illness he would continue to joke. Webster would visit him in hospital to read material with him. Cree would state he had 'one foot in the grate'. 'Don't you mean one foot in the grave?' she asked. 'No,' he said. 'One foot in the grate. I want to be cremated.' Following the failure of his promotions business, Cree suffered a period of illness. This, along with his wife's unexpected death led to Cree's own death in 1980 at the age of 52. Today Cree's plays are popular amongst Amateur Drama companies in Northern Ireland due to their simple humour, recognisable characters and because of the appeal to audiences of all ages.

It was formed late in 1944 from personnel previously exempted from military service due to stomach disorders or injuries (sometimes referred to as a \\"Stomach division\\"). History As World War II progressed, German manpower available for military service declined and this was exacerbated by the severe losses suffered in Normandy, Tunisia and Stalingrad, for example. Groups of men, previously declared unfit for active service, were drafted or recalled into service. These included those with stomach complaints and it was decided that these men would be concentrated into one formation to facilitate the provision of special foods and to isolate infectious or unpleasant conditions (hence the unofficial description of \\"White Bread\\" or Magen (Stomach) Division). In August, 1944, the Division garrisoned Walcheren Island and South Beveland and in October consolidated on Walcheren during the assault by the II Canadian Corps. Although not a first-class formation, the 70th was installed in static defences and supported by ample heavy artillery, held out for several days. The Division, left with no escape route from Walcheren, surrendered on 5 November 1944 and 10,000 Germans became prisoners of war. Later, during the Battle of the Bulge, the Germans employed another \\"Stomach\\" unit, the Infantrie Ersatz und Ausbildungs Battaillon 282 (M), referred to as \\"Stomach Trouble Battalion 282\\" by the 749th Tank Battalion.

Alongside others, the generals at sea were also appointed as Commissioners for the Admiralty and Navy. The generals at sea were referred to both by the title of 'general' and by their former army ranks interchangeably. Today, the title 'admiral' is also commonly - if incorrectly - used. The generals at sea In February 1649, within a month of the execution of Charles I, the Council of State decided to put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission, and Colonel Robert Blake, Colonel Edward Popham and Colonel Richard Deane were appointed by Parliament as the first generals at sea and Commissioners for the Admiralty and Navy. After Popham's death in 1651 he was succeeded in 1652 by General George Monck. Deane was recalled to serve in the army in May 1651, before resuming his post as general at sea in 1652, but was killed at the start of the Battle of the Gabbard on 1 June 1653. Following the death of Deane, Blake and Monck continued to serve alone until 3 December 1653, when Parliament decided to increase the number of generals at sea to four, with a quorum of two, appointing Major-General John Desborow and Vice-Admiral William Penn (who had been recommended by Monck) to serve alongside Blake and Monck as generals at sea, with all four also serving as Commissioners for the Admiralty and Navy along with Colonel Philip Jones, Colonel John Clerk, John Stone, Major William Burton, Vincent Gooking and Lieutenant-Colonel Kelsey. Penn's naval career was suspended after the failure to successfully execute the Western Design against Spanish colonies in the West Indies in 1655, which resulted in his temporary imprisonment in the Tower of London. In January 1656, Edward Montague was appointed general at sea. Blake continued to serve until his death at sea on 7 August 1657, and Montagu until 1665.

He was best known for his expedition to Katanga in 1891. Early years Paul-Am√©d√©e Le Marinel was the son of Am√©d√©e Le Marinel, a French soldier from Normandy who had joined the Belgian revolutionaries in 1830, and then served for eighteen years in the Belgian army. In 1858 Am√©d√©e emigrated to the U.S. and started a farm in Long Grove, Iowa where his two sons, Paul and George, were born. In 1868 the family returned to Belgium, and in 1876 Paul Le Marinel enrolled in the military school, graduating in 1878 with the rank of Sergeant. He served in the 13th Line Regiment for a year, then for a few years in the riflemen's regiment. First Congo posting In 1885 Paul Le Marinel was seconded to the Military Cartographic Institute and was sent to the Congo where he was assigned to the topographical brigade led by Captain Jungers. Soon after arriving he was transferred to Luluabourg, the administrative capital of the Kasai district, which had been founded a year earlier by the German explorer Hermann Wissmann. Wissman went on an expedition to the Lubi, leaving Le Marinel in command of the post, but was soon forced to return due to hostile natives and a smallpox epidemic. In July 1886 Wissman left on another expedition, taking Le Marinel in the party. When they reached Nyangwe they heard news that the Arabs had taken the post at Stanley Falls. Wissmann decided to press on with a caravan of sixty of the best troops, leaving Le Marinel to return to Luluaberg with the much weakened remainder of the expedition. Back in Luluaburg, Le Marinel received a message from Luebo reporting that the natives around the post had revolted. Le Marinel decided to crush the rebellion. His native troops deserted when they saw the enemy. The war was a disaster and Le Marinel only narrowly escaped death. During his retreat, Le Marinel meet the chief Zappo Zap near Lusambo. Zappo Zap's warriors were soon to become important allies of the Belgians. In 1888 Le Marinel was due to return to Europe for leave after his three-year term. While in Boma in April 1888 waiting to embark, he met Alexandre Delcommune, who had a commission from Albert Thys, assistant to King Leopold II of Belgium and founder of the Congo Compagnie de Commerce et d'Industrie. Delcommune was exploring the rivers of the Congo Basin to determine the economic potential of a railway along the lower Congo river. He persuaded Le Marinel to delay his return to Europe to assist in exploration of the Kasa√Ø, Sankuru and Lubefu. Second Congo posting In late July 1889 Le Marinel returned to Boma to start his second term of service. He had been promoted to lieutenant and was appointed Commissioner of the Kasai-Lualaba district. He was assigned two main tasks. One was the creation of a military post near Luluaburg. Arab or Swahili traders had penetrated to the Great Lakes from the east coast of Africa, and were pressing into the Congo Basin in search of slaves and ivory. The military post was to defend against this threat, and it was left to Le Marinel to choose a suitable place. Le Marinel chose Lusambo, at the end of the navigable portion of the Sankuru River and in May 1890 was at this place. The Governor- General, Camille Smith, asked Le Marinel to investigate Bena Kamba, a town on the Lomami, as an alternative place for the post. Le Marinel did so against his will, but eventually Lusambo was chosen. The station would soon become one of the most important military posts of the Belgian Congo. Le Marinel brought the Zappo Zaps to Luluabourg, where they were used to enforce the government's policy of taxation and forced labor in the Kasai, earning a reputation for great brutality. Le Marinel's second task, given to him directly by Leopold II, was to occupy Katanga. Le Marinel left Lusambo on 23 December 1890 with instructions to raise the Belgian flag in Bunkeya, the Katangan capital, distant. The expedition included 180 African soldiers, many of whom were Hausa, and 150 porters. They marched along the Lubi through a well-populated region that had not previously been visited by Europeans, and crossed the Sankuru River. In January 1891 the group reached Luaba, where they asked permission to cross the Kanyok state controlled by Kabw Muzemb, a well-armed slaver. They were allowed to proceed, and arrived at the Kanyok capital on 26 January 1891. After a week, the expedition prepared to move on. Through a misunderstanding, a fight broke out and the buildings in the king's compound were burned down. The expedition moved on to the Luilu River, where they built canoes to make the crossing. In March the expedition crossed the Lualaba, where they met a representative of Msiri, the ruler of Katanga. Continuing south, on 18 April 1891 they reached Bunkeya and were received courteously by Msiri. Le Marinel spent seven weeks at Bunkeya, but was unable to persuade Msiri to formally accept Belgian authority. He left a small garrison nearby to observe developments and returned to Lusambo, arriving on 18 August 1891. An expedition under Delcommune reached Bunkeya later that year, but had no more success. In April 1892, Le Marinel handed over command of the fortified post of Lusambo and the Kasai/Lualaba region to Francis Dhanis, and returned to Belgium. Later career Le Marinel returned to Congo in 1893 as a state inspector. That year he had to send an expedition to rescue Francis Dhanis, who was fighting the Arabs at Nyangwe. In 1894 he was commissioned to undertake an inspection trip to the U√©l√© River near the northern border of the Free State which was disputed with the French, and to make comprehensive reforms in the administration. He had to deal with constant quarrels between his officials and others in the Free State, and at this time began drinking heavily. Le Marinel returned to Europe in 1896. He served in the army in Belgium for some time, being promoted to Captain Commandant in 1897. He left the Army in 1899. He received many offers from trading companies to assist in their enterprises in Central Africa, but did not return there until 1906, in the capacity of a director of the Compagnie du Lomami. The job was disappointing. The pioneering days were over and most of the work was routine administration. The system was inefficient and there were many abuses. Still, Le Marinel accepted another job in 1908 as director of the Soci√©t√© Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo. In January 1910 he left the Congo for good, with his health fast deteriorating. He died in 1912, aged little more than 54 years. The Le Marinel hydroelectric station near Kolwezi in Katanga was opened in 1956, named in his memory. The dam is high and long, and produced an average of 1,430 million kWh per year.

Originating from an area of low pressure associated with a monsoon trough in late-September, Brian quickly organized into a tropical storm over the South China Sea on September 30\\\\. Tracking along a general west-southwest to westerly course, the storm attained typhoon status on October 1 before making landfall along the southern coast of Hainan Island the following day. Slight weakening occurred during Brian's brief passage of Hainan Island before the system entered the Gulf of Tonkin. The storm ultimately struck Vietnam on October 3 before dissipating the next day over Laos. Across Hainan Island, Brian caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure. Nearly 185,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm's high winds or flash flooding. Communications were severely disrupted as of power and telephone lines were downed. Brian killed 40 people and inflicted 837 million Renminbi (US$222 million) in damage throughout Hainan before impacting Vietnam and causing further damage. Significant losses were reported in Vietnam as well; however, the rapid succession of Brian and two other typhoons made it difficult to differentiate the losses caused by each storm. Meteorological history In late September 1989, an active monsoon trough over the South China Sea spawned a tropical disturbance near northern Luzon. By September 28, a broad band of convection associated with a weak area of low pressure developed within the trough. Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. Aided by a well-defined anticyclone, the low quickly organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Initially steered westward by a subtropical ridge, the depression became quasi-stationary on September 30 about 360 km (225 mi) southeast of Hong Kong as the ridge weakened. Shortly after the system stalled, the JTWC also began warning on it as a tropical depression. Following a reintensification of the ridge later on September 30, the depression resumed a west-southwesterly track. During this time, the depression attained tropical storm status and was given the name Brian by the JTWC. Over the following 24 hours, Brian continued to intensify and ultimately reached typhoon strength late on October 1. After developing a large eye, Brian reached its peak intensity on October 2 with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph; one-minute sustained). The JMA also classified Brian as a typhoon around this time, estimating the storm to have attained peak ten-minute sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) as well as a minimum pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Now tracking due west, the typhoon moved towards Hainan Island and ultimately made landfall along the southeastern coast of the island around 1500 UTC. Only slight weakening took place as the typhoon skirted along the southern coast of Hainan Island. By October 3, Brian had entered the Gulf of Tonkin and struck Vietnam later that day near Vinh with winds of 140 km/h (85 km/h). Rapid dissipation ensued once onshore and Brian eventually dissipated on October 4 over the mountainous terrain of Laos. Impact Striking Hainan Island as a strong typhoon, Brian caused widespread wind damage in the region. Approximately of power lines and of telephone lines were downed by the storm, severely disrupting communications. Many homes in southern areas of Hainan either collapsed or lost their roofs amidst hurricane-force winds. About 15,900 homes collapsed throughout the island and another 169,000 were damaged. Over 25 million lumber and rubber trees were snapped or uprooted by the typhoon. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Heavy rains accompanying the storm triggered significant flash flooding. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Many rivers across the island overtopped their banks and inundated surrounding areas, including an estimated 194,000 acres of rice paddies. Across Hainan, 40 people were killed and 529 others were injured by the storm. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Losses throughout the region reached 837 million Renminbi (US$222 million). Although Hong Kong was not in the direct path of the storm, the Hong Kong Observatory issued storm signals on September 30 as high winds associated with the typhoon were expected to impact the city. On October 2, the storm passed south of the city. Wind gusts associated with the storm reached on Waglan Island; however, no damage was reported. Along the coast, a storm surge of occurred on Waglan. Due to the severe damage caused by Typhoon Brian, the provincial flood control headquarters urged the Chinese Government to organize relief efforts at all levels. (Accessed through LexisNexis) By October 8, the Government of Hainan Island deployed two relief teams to the hardest hit areas. Additionally, 5 million Renminbi in aid was supplied to the region. In Vietnam, heavy rains produced by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from the Vietnamese flood control committee indicated that 60,000 hectares (148,000 acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700 metric tons (7,400 short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000 homes collapsed and 119,000 others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they had yet to be verified by October 12\\\\. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the rapid succession of storms, losses resulting from the three typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, the Vietnamese Government appealed for international assistance.

J Virol 84(7):3682‚Äì89 It has a number of unique features unlike any previously described virus. Virology The virons are enveloped and pleomorphic is shape. The envelope contains a variety of lipids including cardiolipins, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl esters and phosphatidylglycerosulfates. There are two major proteins in the envelope ‚Äî VP3 (12 kiloDaltons in weight) and VP4 (60 kiloDaltons in weight). The virons exit the host without lysis suggesting a budding mechanism. Genome The genome is a single molecule of double stranded DNA, circular, 8082 base pairs in length with a G+C content of 55.8%. It has eight open reading frames (ORFs). VP3 and VP4 are encoded by ORF3 and ORF4 respectively. ORF1 is probably a replication initiation protein. ORF3 encodes an integral membrane protein with a 50 amino acid signal sequence and two transmembrane regions. Before the C-terminal transmembrane domain is a coiled-coil region. ORF7 contains a NTPase domain but its function is not clear. Taxonomy Examination of the proteins and genome organisation of this virus suggests that it related to the single stranded DNA virus Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1, the plasmid pHK2 and a region within the archeon Haloferax volcanii. It seems likely that the plasmid pHK2 may be a virus that can form circular plasmids and that the region within Haloferax volcanii is a prophage. The similarity between these double stranded DNA elements and the single stranded virus Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 is currently unique. If this relationship can be confirmed for other viruses it suggests that the currently used Baltimore system of classification may be in need of revision.

He also performed as a violinist with Pearl Bailey, Jack Benny and others. As a jazz musician, he played clarinet, saxophone, flute and piano in ensembles and big bands. Senerchia's professional baseball career lasted for eight seasons (1949; 1952‚Äì58). He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Mostly a third baseman early in his career, he later converted to pitcher as a minor leaguer. However, he appeared in the Major Leagues almost exclusively as a third baseman, starting 26 games at the position for the last place Pirates during the final six weeks of the 1952 season, in which they lost 112 out of the 154 games they played. Although he would collect only 22 hits in an even 100 at bats, Senerchia had some shining moments.

Ver√≥n has published books on sociology, social psychology, communication and semiotics since 1968. His early period was influenced by the structuralism of Claude L√©vi-Strauss and the binary theory of the sign of Ferdinand de Saussure, and then the triadic sign theory of Charles Sanders Peirce, on whom he relied to develop his theory of social semiosis (1988). In 1974 he founded the journal LENGUAjes in Buenos Aires, along with Oscar Steinberg, Juan Carlos Indart, and Oscar Traversa. The publication of this journal was the effective introduction of semiotics in Argentina. Between 1970 and 1978, Ver√≥n was president of the Argentine Association of Semiotics.

It is the second western film directed by Giulio Petroni. At first the director was to be Franco Giraldi, but then he moved to direct A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die and Petroni replaced him. Plot Roger Pratt and his band stop a stagecoach and kill the driver and the passengers, including a priest and a young woman, but the man he expected is not there so he also shoots his informant. Tim, who in fact is that man, arrives later by horse to the scene and starts digging graves. Harry watches him, approaches and gives help, and then rides off without saying a word. Later Tim sees Harry among gold miners in a saloon, losing at poker, and expose the games as crooked ‚Äì but he refuses to draw against the gambler, showing that he carries no gun. There is a brawl and they are beaten out. Harry tells Tim he has gold that he has mined hidden in his underwear and the latter suggests that he deposits it in the bank at Pueblo city. Next day Tim and some accomplices manage to convince the gullible Harry that a shack in the deserted town of Pueblo city is a temporary bank office. When Harry loses his deposit slip and returns, all are gone. Harry finds Tim at a market and attacks him. Tim says he has invested his share in the tent and water basin for a mermaid show. The upset Harry destroys the tent and basin and crying he tells Tim that he was to use the gold to buy cattle for a ranch that he inherited from his father. Tim promises to help him get the money back and leaves, waving to the \\"mermaid\\". They try to make money running a fake telegraph service but have to escape from Pratt's gang, joining a funeral procession. Tim eyes the beautiful widow and tells Harry that the dead man was a famous bank robber and that he will make the widow tell where the loot is hidden. By pretending to be a close friend of the dead husband he gets invited in for food, and to keep out the anxious Harry, who keeps knocking at the window, he tells him that the loot is buried under a tree. At night Harry digs a deep hole while Tim gets the widow into bed. When Harry learns the truth from some passers-bye he breaks into the house and starts a fight and the widow runs out in her underwear calling for the sheriff. In jail Harry has money for bail, and Tim convinces him to pay for both, because Harry will need help to escape from the Pratt gang, who they see arrive. At night they slip out, but the gang finds them sleeping and beats them, before stringing up Harry in a tree. Tim then jump kicks the man holding him at gunpoint, takes the gun and shoots off the rope, and kills the five men, though Pratt escapes. He tells Harry that he tries to avoid using a gun, as it is the same as a calling card for him. Harry sees that the men are all shot in the forehead and learns that Tim really is the gunfighter Billy Boy, who had a run-in with Pratt's father and killed two of Pratt's brothers who were sent against him. They stop at a cantina and see a Wells Fargo wagon transporting gold from a mine. The waiter points out Frank Benton who is obsessed with the idea of robbing the wagon. Harry suggests that they join forces but Billy wants to avoid men with fixed ideas. He says that they shall paint a wagon like the Wells Fargo one and arrive to the mine earlier and pick up the gold ‚Äì without any bloodshed. While Billy sleeps Harry goes with the plan to Benton and they paint the wagon and pick up the gold. However, when they get a military escort to town Benton shoots them, and is about to shoot the protesting Harry when Billy drops him with a bullet in his head. The two have to escape from the posse though, without any gold. They find the inherited ranch being a run-down shack. They start repairing it, and Billy charms the hardware owner's wife into giving them credit while Harry ‚Äùfishes‚Äù cups from the shelf with a rod. They have no cattle but some rabbits, which has been Billy's pet project earlier. We see Pratt the older join with his son and a new gang. They attack the house but are driven back by Billy's fire. They besiege the house and send out men with dynamite. One gets up at the roof but falls through (at a place where we earlier have seen Harry fall). Billy lets part of the dynamite explode while they take cover and then lets the rest explode when the gang enters the house. Harry disappears in the explosion when he tries to save the rabbits. When Billy searches for Harry, Pratt the older gets the drop on him. When Roger approaches with his knife Billy walks aside to make him walk into a trap (who he earlier has said never caught the fox it was meant for) and he uses the opportunity to draw and shoot them. Harry now emerges. Billy says that the house can be rebuilt by Harry but that he will leave as he has only been bad luck. Harry, however, gets on his horse and accompanies him.

Here the relationship is mainly in the comic mode, which means that the manipulations fail or backfire. Neither partner gets his objective(s) but they stay together forming a conjunctive partnership.Fridlund, Bert: The Spaghetti Western. A Thematic Analysis.

Gypsum blocks are composed of gypsum, plaster, water and in some cases additives like vegetable or wood fiber for greater strength. Partition walls, made from gypsum blocks, require no sub-structure for erection and gypsum adhesive is used as bonding agent, not standard mortar. Because of this fundamental difference, gypsum blocks shouldn't be confused with the thinner plasterboard (also known as wallboard or gypsum board) used for paneling stud walls. Construction of a non-load bearing partition wall of gypsum blocks Manufacture A gypsum block is made of gypsum plaster and water. The manufacturing process is automated at production plants where raw gypsum (CaSO4¬∑2H2O) is ground and dried, then heated to remove three-quarters of the bound water and thus transformed into calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4¬∑¬ΩH2O), also known as gypsum plaster, stucco, calcined gypsum or plaster of Paris. This process is also called calcination. The plaster is then mixed with water, stirred and poured into molds to form gypsum blocks with standard formats, either solid, or with round or square open cores to reduce weight and conserve materials. Each block is moulded with tongue and groove at all sides, to enable quick and easy assembly. Still wet, the gypsum blocks are taken out of the molds and put into drying chambers. The dried gypsum blocks are packaged at the production plant and then transported to warehouses or construction sites. Specifications Gypsum blocks are manufactured in accordance with the European and British EN 12859 Standard. The dimensions of European standard gypsum blocks are: length: 666 mm, height: 500 mm. Three blocks thus make 1 m2. Gypsum blocks vary in thickness, density and type. In the U.S. gypsum blocks were made in 2\\", 3\\", 4\\" and 6\\" thicknesses. In Europe they are available in thicknesses of 60 mm, 70 mm, 80 mm or 100 mm. In European residential buildings regularly 80 or 100 mm thick gypsum blocks are being used. For construction purposes especially two densities are important: *the medium gross density of 850 kg/m3 to 1.100 kg/m3 (white coloured blocks, suitable for standard usage) *the high gross density blocks of 1.100 kg/m3 to 1.500 kg/m3 (reddish colour, suitable for walls with higher acoustic performance requirements) The dimensions of these blocks are: length 500 mm, height 500 mm. Four blocks thus make 1 m2. For wet areas like domestic kitchens, bathrooms and cellars water-repellent hydro blocks (mostly with a bluish colour) are available, both in medium and high gross density. Properties Gypsum blocks combine the advantages of classical masonry with modern drywall construction. Similar to masonry, walls built with gypsum blocks are massive, void-free and of high stability. Because no mortar, sand or plaster are used, the walls are (almost) built without water, like drywalls. To distinguish this kind of construction from conventional drywalls with wall studs and gypsum panels or gypsum fiber boards, the construction with gypsum blocks is often referred to as massive drywall construction. Due to the grammage of about 54 kg/m2 to 120 kg/m2, non-bearing partition walls out of gypsum blocks fall into the category of lightweight partition walls. Due to the construction technique they are stable solid walls with a high resistance to mechanical strain, which reduces maintenance and repair. Fire resistance rating Gypsum is a mineral and non-combustible building material (a class A1 building material in accordance with the German DIN 4102, the European EN 13501 or the British BS 476 or the American ASTM E119) consisting of calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO4¬∑2H2O). Because of the stored water, gypsum is a good fire protection building material. In the event of fire, the water crystals vaporize, actively slowing the spread of the fire. Massive gypsum blocks have a high level of passive fire protection: 60 mm thickness offers 30 minutes of fire resistance (F30-A in accordance with the German DIN 4102 standard, the European EN 13501 or the British BS 476); 80 mm thickness offers 2 hours of fire resistance (F120-A); and 100 mm thickness offers 3 hours of fire resistance (F180-A). The fire resistance ratings for the US are similar. Sound proof properties To improve the sound proof qualities of gypsum block partition walls, insulation strips are used on all sides to connect the partition walls to adjacent walls, ceilings and floors. The acoustic decoupling of the walls in this way reduces the acoustic transmissions of these lightweight partition walls significantly. Construction techniques Gypsum blocks are typically laid in a compatible gypsum mortar or adhesive, then covered with a coat of finish plaster. Materials are classified according to the requirements of ASTM standard C52. Difference U.S. and Europe In the U.S. gypsum blocks were commonly used in the early 20th century (1900 - 1926), but at the end of the 1920s had largely been replaced by gypsum wallboards, concrete masonry units and framed gypsum drywall partitions. Gypsum blocks are no longer manufactured in the United States. In Europe gypsum blocks are still widely used and are gaining popularity as a building material with very low emissions of volatile organic compounds, extremely low radiation values and a neutral pH value that contribute to a healthy living environment.

This followed the British banning the trade of slaves between colonies in 1807 with their emancipation by 1834. Dutch rule In 1652, Jan van Riebeeck set up a refreshment station for ships bound to the Dutch East Indies in what is now Cape Town and requested slaves. The first slave, Abraham van Batavia arrived in 1653 (\\"van Batavia\\" meaning \\"from Batavia\\", the name of Jakarta during the Dutch colonial period), and shortly afterward, a slaving voyage was undertaken from the Cape to Mauritius and Madagascar. Eventually, van Riebeeck forcibly enslaved Africans for work in the Cape Colony. In April 1657, there were ten slaves in the settlement, from a population of 144. That increased greatly the next year, when the Dutch captured a Portuguese slaver with 500 Angolan slaves, and 250 were taken to the Cape. Two months later, a further 228 slaves arrived from Guinea. The process was enhanced when settler colonialism commenced when former Dutch East India Company officials were granted land lots. The agricultural settlements of the Boers economically dislocated the pastoral Khoikhoi in Table Bay, who were forced to serve as servants due to their loss of grazing land. The Dutch colonists additionally imported slaves from Portuguese Mozambique, French Madagascar, and Dutch India. Slaves in the Dutch colonies were given poor food, subject to poor living conditions, and punished with whipping for fleeing or disobeying orders. British rule Plaque commemorating 175th Anniversary of emancipation, Saron Mission Church, Saron, Western Cape Province Threats to Dutch control of the Cape Colony had emerged in the 18th century, when the Dutch East India Company was weakened during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. During the 1780s, troops of the French Royal Army were stationed in the Cape to prevent invasion by Great Britain. The Cape was invaded by the British in 1795 during the War of the First Coalition, and occupied until 1803. Britain later formally annexed the Cape and later passed the Slave Trade Act 1807. It was enforced from 1808, ending the external slave trade. Slaves were permitted to be traded only within the colony. At the same time, Parliament passed a series of acts known as the amelioration laws designed to provide better living conditions for slaves. These acts allowed slaves to marry, purchase their own freedom, live with their families, and receive a basic education. The acts also limited punishments and work hours, and encouraged missionaries to convert Africans to Christianity. The first large wave of British settlers, the 1820 Settlers, were not permitted to own slaves. Abolition In 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act received Royal Assent from King William IV; this paved the way for the abolition of slavery within the British Empire and its colonies. It was reported that there were 38,427 slaves in the Cape of Good Hope in 1833, many fewer than in Jamaica, Barbados or Mauritius, though higher than the reported numbers in other British colonies. On 1 August 1834, all slaves in the British Empire were emancipated, but they were indentured to their former owners in an apprenticeship system which was abolished in two stages; the first set of apprenticeships came to an end on 1 August 1838, while the final apprenticeships were scheduled to cease on 1 August 1840, six years after the official emancipation.

Falk quipped that when they merged the two songs, \\"everything fell into place\\". Additionally, Falk deemed it the perfect accompaniment to \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" and selected it as his favourite \\"out of the three tracks [that I have on the Up All Night album]\\". It premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 21 November 2011. One Direction confirmed that \\"One Thing\\" would be released as the third single from their debut studio album, Up All Night, on 22 November 2011. Syco Music described the song as an \\"epic pop smash-in-waiting, featuring soaring vocal harmonies, powerhouse guitar riffs and an anthemic chorus that refuses to leave your head.\\" The track was released digitally in various European countries on 6 January 2012. \\"I Should Have Kissed You\\", the B-side to \\"One Thing\\", was confirmed on 25 January 2012.

Written in the key of D major, the song set in the time signature of common time at a fast-paced tempo of 128 beats per minute. The track incorporates rock music influences and a simplistic guitar riff. The chorus of the song is predominantly featured alongside the bridge and is backed by wordless chants. The song has been noted as musically similar to the Backstreet Boys song \\"I Want It That Way\\" and to the group's debut single, \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\". Critical reception Due to its resemblance to the aforementioned Backstreet Boys number, PopMatterss Zachary Houle suggested that there could occur \\"a pretty compelling case to launch a plagiarism lawsuit\\", concluding: \\"Homage or theft? You decide\\". Brian Mansfield from USA Today felt the song's Backstreet Boys-references \\"may or may not be intentional,\\" but noted that the attribute \\"is the same.\\" Lewis Corner from Digital Spy awarded the song four out five stars, complimented the song's guitar riff, its \\"forceful\\" chorus, and the melody as memorable, and summarised it as an \\"arena-ready hit\\". A Newsround reviewer gave the song four and half stars out five stars, praising the group's vocal performance and its sonic palette. Billboard correspondent Jason Lipshutz hailed \\"One Thing\\" as \\"perfectly executed pop rock\\" and opined that it \\"could own radio for months\\".

Music video The accompanying music video was directed by Declan Whitebloom in London on 28 November 2011. Whitebloom approached shooting the clip with a \\"what you get, is what you get\\" sentiment, which, as he noted, \\"can create some real magic.\\" In regard to its concept, Whiteboom characterised the clip as \\"kind of Monkees or Beatles-esque\\", elaborating that it revolves around \\"five lads go[ing] crazy in London, it's like a big day out in London.\\" In a December interview with Capital FM, member Harry Styles reflected that the shoot was a fun, careless romp. Premiering on YouTube on 13 January 2012, the music video depicts the band performing in and around London. As of December 2019, the music video has garnered more than 630 million YouTube views. One Direction surged 35-10 from the previous week on Billboards Social 50 chart.

Biography Dola and her siblings were among the first native speakers of Modern Hebrew. Her brother, Itamar Ben-Avi, was the first native speaker. In 1921, she married Max Wittmann, a German who became the first non-Jewish language activist in Palestine to found a Hebrew-only family with a native speaker of Hebrew.See Orbaum's account. Orbaum, a columnist for the Jerusalem Post, had met the couple on numerous occasions. At the time of her death, she was the world's oldest native speaker of Modern Hebrew. Both Dola and her husband are buried in the Alliance Church International Cemetery in the German Colony neighborhood of Jerusalem. Relevance to linguistic scholarship Dola's parents were the first people to raise a family in a strictly unilingual environment using only Modern Hebrew as a language for everyday use, thus producing the first native speakers of the language. Though it is common for modern linguists to have access to the last native speakers of dying languages, the opposite is rather exceptional. Modern Hebrew is the only known language to have afforded access to the first native speakers of a nascent \\"new\\" language, validating Eliezer Ben-Yehuda's claim that a \\"dead\\" and \\"holy\\" language such as Hebrew could be revived as a secular natively spoken language without the interference of religion and in spite of the opposition of the religious community. Dola survived her older brother by 60 years, well into a millennium in which Modern Hebrew had seven million speakers, including three million native speakers and many non-Jews.

The crouched figure was recovered after being partially damaged by a milling machine in 2011. The head and left arm were presumed destroyed by the peat harvester, until later found. Radiocarbon dating places him around 2000 BC, making it the oldest fleshed bog body of Europe. Examination Cashel Man had once lived in what was a flourishing community. The legs were found to be protruding from the skin of the corpse, in addition to being exceptionally well preserved. The remaining part of the body inside of the bag-like skin was not as well preserved. The stomach of the man had long since decomposed, which made analyzing his last meal impossible. The body parts that had been disturbed by the milling machine were later recovered, including part of the head, which had closely cut hair. The body was later moved to the National Museum of Ireland for examination. The man was believed to have been buried with his arms holding his legs, his knees bent toward his chest. Death The man had a pre-mortem broken arm, caused by a strike with a sharp object. His back was broken in two places (believed to have happened after his death), and a cut on his back, most likely from the same blade that broke his arm. The body was accompanied by wooden stakes, suggesting ritual sacrifice. The wound on the man's arm suggests that it was a defensive wound. The man may have once been the king of his region, and was sacrificed due to poor harvests, as a king was believed to have been responsible for such things. Like Old Croghan Man and Clonycavan Man, he was buried near a hill that may have been used for kingship initiation.

The church is notable as the possible burial place of King Beorhtric, and for the discovery of five stones with Brittonic inscriptions dating to the 7th to 9th centuries. A notable feature is the unique hexagonal lead font dating to around 1200. The Anglo- Saxon nave was demolished in 1842. History St Aldhelm, who was Bishop of Sherborne around 705, founded a church at Wareham which is probably the church of Lady St. Mary. A nunnery may have been associated with it, but this was destroyed by a Danish raid in 876, before being rebuilt by the daughter of Alfred the Great around 900. The church may also be where Beorhtric, King of Wessex, was buried in 802, and where the body of King Edward the Martyr was brought after he had been murdered at Corfe Castle in 978. The church On 7 May 1952 the church was officially designated as a Grade I listed building. The church is built of Purbeck limestone and has slate and tile roofs. It has a long chancel and a four-bay nave with two aisles. The south chapel is at a lower level than the rest of the building and at one time had a treasury above. The robust tower is at the west end of the church and is built in four stages, with diagonal buttressing to the lower three. There is a large transomed window at the west end and another at the east end that was installed by Clayton & Bell between 1886 and 1890. The church was founded in the 8th century, with the south chapel dating to the 12th century. Other parts of the building date to the 14th century and the tower probably to the early 16th century. Rectors The first recorded rector of the church was Peter de Deserto (1302‚Äì08) who followed Prior Nicholas Bynet (c. 1296). In 1678 the rectory was annexed to that of Holy Trinity, Wareham, and the first rector of both parishes was John Jones.

Following the peace treaty, he became a settler and well-known surveyor in colonial British Quebec.The American Revolution, Garrison Life in French Canada and New York: Journal of an officer in the Prinz Friedrich Regiment, 1776-1783, By Julius Friedrich von Hille, Mary C.

Lynn, p. 56 who was adopted into the Pincier von K√∂nigstein family, known as von Pincier in German and Swedish, or de Pincier in French. They were members of the Swedish nobility. Throughout his military career in German-speaking regiments, he used the surname von Pincier, but, later, in Canada, he adopted a French version of his surname, altering the spelling to de Pencier. He left many descendants in Canada. Some became prominent: and include an Anglican archbishop, The Most Rev. Dr Adam de Pencier, and that prelate's grandson, Michael de Pencier, a decorated Canadian publisher, entrepreneur, and environmental conservationist. Family members continue to spell the surname, de Pencier or dePencier. Birth The child, Christian Theodor (Braunschweig 1750‚Äì 1824), was born out of wedlock as the only illegitimate child of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, and married Frenchwoman. His mother‚Äôs husband, a French grenadier captain named de Martigny, later killed himself, perhaps out of jealousy.The American Revolution, Garrison Life in French Canada and New York: Journal of an officer in the Prinz Friedrich Regiment, 1776-1783, By Julius Friedrich von Hille, Mary C. Lynn, p. 56 Widowed, she remarried to a Franco-Swedish nobleman belonging to the family of Pincier von K√∂nigstein. Christian Theodor was never recognized by his father, and, instead, was adopted by his mother's husband, Georges-Henri de Pincier, a descendant of Baron Pincier (#109), whose family had received their patent of nobility in Stockholm from Charles XII of Sweden in 1698. From this step- father, young Christian Theodor gained the surname which he bore. He was to use it for the rest of his life prefixed by one or other of the German or French noble particles von or de as the situation warranted. This was a common practice of the time among the nobility, who alternated between German and French custom, as they moved about Western Europe during their careers and travels. Early life At age 14, de Pencier volunteered as a cadet and learned to ride in his father's ducal stables. His extraordinary horsemanship by age 16 enabled him to become standard bearer for his military unit. He received his first commission the next year, and, in 1771, at age 21, was promoted to lieutenant. Between 1773 and 1774 he travelled in France and Italy, visiting Florence, Rome and Naples. During the period of his early life, he was celebrated for his numerous love affairs and rumours of liaisons with many noblewomen. In 1775, he wrote a poem dedicated to donna Elisabeth de Baffa Trasci (1750‚Äì1795) an Albanian aristocrat whom he met in Naples. She refused his marriage proposals, but gave him an illegitimate daughter, Carlotta Maria Amalia. The poem was published in 1782 under a pseudonym. Theodore became a superb horseman and studied literature, poetry, astronomy, engineering, and also military artillery strategy and tactics while mastering French, German, Italian, Latin and English. Army career As Theodore de Pencier was assigned to Prince Frederick's regiment as part the Hessian cavalry of General Baron Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, the young officer was destined to see action in North America during the American Revolution. In June 1776, he and 4,000 Hessian 'mercenaries,' many of whom had not left Hesse-Cassel willingly, arrived in Quebec. In the early summer of 1776, Sir Guy Carleton, the British governor and commander-in-chief in Quebec, tasked General John Burgoyne with driving the invading Americans out of the province and south into New York. Faced with Burgoyne's 6,000 British troops and Riedesel's 4,000 German mercenaries, the weakened Americans retreated to Sorel at the confluence of the St. Lawrence and Richelieu rivers. The Americans under General Horatio Gates retreated, this time to the safety of formidable Fort Ticonderoga. The Hessians, much to the frustration of Baron Riedesel, were largely unprepared for pursuit. Historian Thomas Randall compared \\"the south-moving procession of British infantry and German infantry and cavalry, batteries of artillery, ammunition wagons, supply wagons\\" to a travelling circus. The Hessians seemed alien to their British counterparts. They often sang psalms on the march and caught and tamed wild animals. Baroness Riedesel and her entourage travelled by elegant caleche, while the Brunswick Dragoons, short on horses, had to march with their enormous cocked hats, thick coats, leather breeches, and jack boots rising above their knees. Captain de Pencier, as an officer, was fortunate to retain his mount. He also avoided the fate of many Hessians: death under American fire by sharpshooters using the deadly accurate Pennsylvania flintlock. With significant losses and failed manoeuvres on both ends of the Mohawk Valley, Lake Ontario, and the Hudson, Burgoyne surrendered after the Battle of Saratoga in the face of heavy Yankee artillery and more than 14,000 men mustered by Gates. The Hessians had recently suffered a major defeat at Bennington with 200 dead and many more imprisoned. De Pencier likely encountered frontier spies Roger Stevens and Stephen Burritt for the first time here at Bennington. Stevens, imprisoned with Burritt after the battle, became the first to settle the Rideau 15 years later, providing his homestead as a meeting place for de Pencier and his Rideau survey teams. The Americans reneged on the terms of surrender; rather than sending the captive Europeans home, they sent the British troops to prison camps surrounding Boston, while the other Hessian captives were sent to camps in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Officers were put in cramped quarters, with as many as six to a room; Baron Riedesel, his wife and children, initially suffered too, living in small, cold surroundings. All found their conditions improve as the British began paying outrageous American fees for the food and lodging of prisoners. Theodor did not participate in the Battle of Saratoga and remained stationed at the fort in Sorel Quebec for the remainder of the Revolutionary War (1776-1783). De Pencier, by then a widower, returned to Europe in 1783 with most of the Hessian prisoners. He stayed only long enough to receive his honourable discharge from Prince Frederick's regiment and obtain British naturalisation. He returned to Canada the next year, but could not find employment despite letters of recommendation from Baron Riedesel. Signs of his stress began to emerge at this time. He was described as 'haunting' government offices with a 'drooping spirit,' though he was buoyed temporarily by a grant of 20 pounds. He remarried and his second wife gave birth to a second son, Luke. A Loyalist grant of 300 acres from General Haldimand proved to be unmanageable. De Pencier was neither a lumberman nor a farmer and lacked the necessary financial and physical resources to clear the land. He wrote that his hands were \\"accustomed only to the use of the sword and the training of horses, too weak to cut down trees and to sell them at a profit quickly and advantageously.\\" Finally, tired of feeding his family on meager rations, he took up land surveying at the age of 35. His sound education in mathematics enabled him to apprentice using a borrowed theodolite, a calibrated optical instrument used to determine relative position in surveying, navigation, and meteorology. In 1789, he received his full commission as a surveyor. His quarrels with the British authorities continued to consume him. He later complained to Governor General Sherbrooke that he had become a surveyor because he had very little money, despite the sacrifices he and his father had made in battle on behalf of the British. De Pencier received instructions in 1791 to survey the first townships on the Rideau River in what was to become modern-day Ottawa.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Rideau+warriors+Theodore+De+Pencier%3A+in+1791+German+Aristocrat...-a0166275108 In Canada, after his first marriage with Marie Demerais, he remarried Charlotte Rivard Bellefeuille on November 4, 1785 at the Protestant Church in Trois-Rivi√®res.

On April 19, shortly after Easter 1824, the remains of Captain Christian Theodore de Pencier were placed in a modest grave at Fort William Henry by the Richelieu River in Quebec. Moments earlier, a British subaltern reached into de Pencier's coffin and removed his sword, a final act of discourtesy to the dead Hessian officer, and probably a reflection of the fact that suicide was then a crime.

Named after the nearby barbican attached to Walmgate Bar, the centre hosts various music events, family shows and community events throughout the year and is also a venue for conferences. It has a 1,500 seating capacity and a 1,900 standing capacity. York Barbican was also the host venue for the second biggest-ranking snooker tournament, the UK Championship from 2001 to 2006, with the championships returning to the venue in 2011. The centre is located on the southern end of York city centre, opposite the city walls.  History  The current facility was built in 1989 at a price of ¬£15 million by York Council, adding to a swimming pool, which had been previously constructed on the site in 1980. The 1989 construction added a sports hall and auditorium, with a climbing wall facility, caf√© and bars. Despite offering the largest concert facility and a wide range of classes and local events (such as the annual York Interschool Battle of the Bands), York Barbican consistently made losses while it was operated by the council, and in 2000, both the swimming pool and new facilities were placed on the market in a bid to pass them on to private management. By 2003, a single bidder had emerged as the preferred company to develop the site. Proposals to build new swimming facilities were part of the plans. However, a local group of residents, 'Save Our Barbican' (S.O.B.) spearheaded local opposition to the proposals circulated in the public consultation. Later planned developments suggested apartments on the site, or a casino and nightclub facility. By the end of 2004, with no plans accepted and a legal case going forward by the resident group, York Barbican was closed and lay empty for years to come. The swimming pool building was demolished, and the 1989 building began to show signs of weathering and vandalism and closed down. In spring 2011, it finally reopened after a ¬£1.5 million refurbishment, owned by the council but managed by ASM Global, an international venue operator.

The 64-room school was designed to hold 1,551 students. Alongside a regular college entrance curriculum, the school included business-oriented classes to accommodate the interests of white students who had previously been served by the Business High School at Ninth Street and Rhode Island Avenue Northwest. The business focus was in contrast to the technical focus of McKinley Technical High School and Armstrong Technical High School. The school was integrated in 1953, one of the first schools in the District of Columbia to do so.  Uncovered New Deal artwork  In 1934, art students under the guidance of the Baltimore-born artist Nelson Rosenberg created a mural in the cafeteria. Titled An American Panorama, the mural was created as part of the New Deal-era Public Works of Art Project. It was later accompanied by other murals, added by later students, around the school. An American Panorama was uncovered during renovation work in the cafeteria in fall 2013. The fresco is currently being restored and will be incorporated into the final renovation.

He became a local celebrity and an attraction for visitors to the New Forest. Life Harry Mills was born on 19 March 1840 and lived at Emery Down near Lyndhurst until at least 1861.

Sporelake Lawn was located in the Hollands Wood area () near the turning for New Park, on the road between Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst. about north of Brockenhurst. He took up snake-catching for a living, ridding local properties of snakes, armed with little more than a sack and a forked stick.Snakes alive!, BBC Local, Hampshire, 24 July, 2002 He is said to have manufactured and sold ointments from parts of the snakes, and other snakes he boiled so that he might sell their skeletons to curious tourists. He supplied snakes, usually Grass Snakes but occasionally Adders to London Zoo as food for their birds of prey, and snake-eating snakes. It is estimated that he caught tens of thousands of snakes in his lifetime. Following a national press article about him, Mills became a draw for tourists and visitors to the New Forest, who would have their photographs taken with him, buy his snake potions, and listen to his country lore. He regularly attended cricket matches at nearby Balmer Lawn and was paid to sweep the pitch between innings, and hence the nickname \\"Brusher\\" was bestowed upon him. He lived in this manner for nearly thirty years until he decided to build himself a larger hut. When it was nearly completed it was vandalised. No one was caught, but it is thought that it was destroyed to prevent him claiming squatters‚Äô rights as forest law would allow him to claim ownership of the land on which he had lived for so many years. He took up residence in an outbuilding of one of his favourite pubs, the Railway Inn in Brockenhurst, where he died not long after. A marble headstone, paid for by locals, was erected over his grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Brockenhurst. It includes a carved tableau of him at work, in his distinctive wide-brimmed hat. The Railway Inn where Brusher Mills was a regular was renamed The Snakecatcher.

Academics Coolidge High School offers Advanced Placement courses in science, English, math, and history. It has an art room, a media center, a computer lab, and a science lab. According to the 2011 District of Columbia's Comprehensive Assessment System, 32% of students met or exceeded math standards, and 42% of students met or exceeded reading standards. In 2010, the school's graduation rate was 95%, and 47% of graduating students registered at a college or university in the following fall semester. Athletics The school's athletic teams are named the Colts. Coolidge was the first high school in the District to require physical education classes five period per week. Because the school was so new, it could not organize any athletic teams in time for the 1939‚Äì1940 school year, but it did have teams organized for the 1940‚Äì1941 school year. In December 1940, The Colts' first basketball game was played against Woodward Prep. Because the delivery of its basketball hoops was delayed, the game was played at a local Y.M.C.A. Coached by the former head coach of Anacostia High School, Julian Colangelo, Coolidge beat Woodward Prep, 42 to 19. Coolidge also won its second-ever basketball game, winning an away game against Briarley Military Academy by a score of 25 to 17. Coolidge's third basketball game was the first game played in its own gymnasium; it was a 19-to-12 win against Anacostia High School. The Colts first baseball team played its first game in April 1941, playing against Briarley Military Academy. Coolidge lost the game 13 to 7 after committing six errors and walking nine batters. Coolidge's football team, coached by Sherman Rees and Gil Roberts, began playing in September 1941. Coolidge lost its first game 27 to 0 against John Handley High School. Coolidge played its second football game, and its first home game, against National Training School. Coolidge won the game 7 to 6. The 1946‚Äì1947 school year was particularly successful at Coolidge, with the school's baseball, basketball, football, golf, rifle, and archery teams all bringing in District championships that year. After years without a stadium, the District's Board of Education and the District's Board of Commissioners approved construction of a stadium behind the school at Third and Sheridan streets in 1945. The land was owned by the federal government. Coolidge did not want to build a stadium on federally owned land so it would not have to share ticket revenue with the federal government. The federal government ended up giving the land to the District Board of Education, allowing Coolidge to continue plans for a 10,000-seat stadium, football and baseball field, and a quarter-mile track. President Harry Truman cut the stadium's construction from the District's 1952 budget in order to keep the District's budget balanced. The District's Board of Commissioners approved a 1955 budget that included Coolidge's stadium. Congress ended up appropriating funds for the stadium's construction in the 1955 budget. In 2007, Coolidge opened its new football field, including a digital scoreboard, a press box, and a new public-address system. In 2010, Coolidge hired Natalie Randolph as its football coach, making her the only female head football coach in the nation. Randolph had previously played wide receiver for the D.C. Divas women's professional football team. Randolph also teaches environmental sciences. Demographics Coolidge High School had 547 students enrolled during the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. Of these students, 87 percent were black, 12 percent were Hispanic/Latino, and 1 percent were white. History In order to relieve crowding at Roosevelt High School, Superintendent Frank W. Ballou proposed building a new high school for students living in Manor Park and Takoma Park. Dr. Ballou suggested that the new high school should be built at Fifth and Sheridan streets NW, on property that the District of Columbia had purchased five years earlier and across the street from Whittier School, which had been built in 1925. Temporarily named Northern Senior High School, the building of the school was supported by many Takoma Park, Manor Park, Chillum Heights, and Sixteenth Street Heights residents and North Dakota Senator Lynn Frazier. The finance committee of the Board of Education approved the plan soon after Dr. Ballou's recommendation. The House of Representatives originally appropriated $450,000 for the building of the school, but a Senate subcommittee reduced the appropriation to $350,000, despite protests by Senator Frazier. In 1937, the question of a permanent name for the school was raised. The Manor Park Citizens Association and the Brightwood Citizens Association wanted to name the school for Calvin Coolidge, the only former president without a school named after him. Other residents favored using the name Northern High School because it would fit in with existing schools named Eastern, Western, and Central. Those favoring Coolidge won out. The Board of Education planned to build a two-story brick school with a flat roof. Local citizens associations said the planned school would look like a factory. They preferred a colonial style similar to that of nearby Roosevelt High School. The Manor Park Citizens Association held firm, and the plans were modified to include three stories, a pitched roof, and a cupola. Architect Nathan C. Wyeth changed the design to a modern Georgian style. Jeffress-Dryer Inc. won the bid to build the school, and construction began in 1938. The original plans called for one boys' gymnasium and one girls' gymnasium. Because two gymnasiums could not be afforded with the funds appropriated by Congress, the girls' gymnasium was eliminated from the plans. After the Takoma Park Citizens Association petitioned Congress, the District's Board of Commissioners agreed to appropriate an additional $16,000 in order to build the girls' gymnasium. Construction was completed in February 1940, at a cost of $1,500,000. Coolidge opened its doors on September 23, 1940. Its first principal was Thomas J. Holmes, previously the assistant principal of Eastern High School. Holmes did not end up completing his first year as principal, as he took a leave of absence to serve as an officer at Fort Meade in April 1941. During its first school year, Coolidge had 31 teachers, 750 students enrolled, and a capacity of 1,801.

The observance of Christmas was introduced once with the Christianization of Romania but public observance was discouraged during the Communist period (1948‚Äî1989). In the post-communist Romania, Christmas started being celebrated again more festively. The Christmas and holiday season starts officially on November 30, on Saint Andrew's day and ends on January 7, with the celebration of Saint John. Other major holidays in this period are Great Union Day, Saint Nicholas' Day, Saint Ignatius' Day, Christmas Eve (' in Romanian), Christmas Day (' in Romanian), Saint Stephen's day, New Year's Eve (' in Romanian), and the Epiphany. Advent An icon representing the Nativity of Jesus. The seven- week Advent season in anticipation of Jesus Christ's birth is obligatory for all Eastern Christian Romanians. It starts on November 14 yearly and ends up on Christmas Day. November 14, the first day of advent is traditionally called LƒÉsata secului (literally the day the abstinence begins). Any kind of products obtained from animal sources are prohibited. Also, on Wednesdays and on Fridays, oil among other products is not to be eaten. Some special days (for example Saint Ignatius Day or Great Union Day) occur during the period when Christians are allowed to eat fish or dairy. The Christmas Eve should be a day of total abstinence to thank God for sending The Savior. All said, there are forty days of advent (seven to nine of them being exceptions), this being the second abstinence period as length during the Romanian religious year, after the Easter advent. During this season, the Christmas holiday season in Romania starts with Saint Andrew's feast day on November 30. Customs say everyone should hang plenty of garlic and a crucifix next to all doors and windows on the mansion, to keep evil spirits, geani, and spells away from their home. Strigoi or vampires (such as geani) may appear during the night between November 29 and November 30 as this night is popularly known as Noaptea lupului (Night of the wolf). The next day, December 1, is the Great Union Day (Ziua Marii Uniri), the National Day of Romania.CIA World Factbook, Romania - Government It is celebrated by all Romanians. In Bucharest and Alba Iulia Romanian Armed Forces have parades, showing their Land and Air vehicles and performing the Romanian national anthem \\"De»ôteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne!\\", used for the Union back in 1918.Romanian Institute for Cultural Remembrance, The Resolution of the National Assembly in Alba Iulia on December 1, 1918 People are given free Mici and Fasole cu c√¢rna≈£i while they party into the night. Free music concerts and street festivals are organised annually in every Romanian city. There are also numerous Television specials, most notably ones broadcast by Pro TV, which bring famous or important Romanians into the spotlight.Inna on Maruta The day usually ends with fireworks. At the beginning of December, the Christmas lights are turned on all over the streets. The same night, Mo≈ü Nicolae comes and gives children presents.Povestea lui Mos Nicolae Children receive their gifts early in the morning of December 6 or late at night on December 5; traditionally, the gifts are put in their laced up boots. Children are usually given sweets or books; if they have been naughty, they get wooden sticks. On December 20, Saint Ignatius Day, Romanians start the last preparations for Christmas. On this date, they cut pigs for the Christmas Eve supper.La Ignat, cand se taie porcii Around this date, people usually buy their Christmas trees from public markets or supermarkets. On December 24, it is Noaptea de ajun, the day children usually start caroling their neighbors.SƒÉrbƒÉtorile de iarnƒÉ √Æn Bucovina, e noaptea Sf√¢ntului Ajun! On the same date, women bake traditional cookies to give children for their caroling. By that time, the Christmas tree must usually be already decorated. Christmas music Music is an important part of Christmas celebration all over Romania. There is a special genre of music, related to Christmas carols but with more traditional / Christian lyrics. These are named colindƒÉ. Although the text of all colinde is concerned with the events of the Nativity, certain elements of the folk rituals performed around Christmas are probably pre-Christian in origin, having their roots in the Roman Saturnalia and pagan rituals related to the winter solstice and soil fertility. Colinde are performed in all parts of Romania (including Moldova), with regional variations in terms of the number of participants, the exact timing of different melodies and lyrics. In traditional Romanian rural society, preparations for colinde started well in advance (sometimes weeks) before Christmas. The village youth (usually boys) would begin to form groups in different places and designate a leader to practice singing in unison. These groups are called cete de colindƒÉtori, and their numbers vary from region to region. Then, starting on Christmas Eve, the groups would go to different houses and begin singing. In some villages, they go first to the mayor's house, followed by the teacher's house, whereas in other parts there is no pre-established order. The families would then invite them into the house and give them different small gifts such as nuts, dried fruits, and pretzels. There are also adaptations from international hit carols into Romanian, for example \\"Noapte de vis\\" (from \\"Silent Night\\") or \\"O, brad frumos!\\" (from \\"O Tannenbaum\\"). Examples of colinde with religious subject are \\"AstƒÉzi s-a nƒÉscut Hristos\\" (Today Christ Was Born), \\"O, ce veste minunatƒÉ!\\" (Oh, What Wonderful News!), \\" Trei pƒÉstori\\" (Three Shepherds), \\" Trei crai de la rƒÉrƒÉrit\\", \\" Steaua\\" (The Star) or \\" Sus la poarta Raiului\\" (Up at Heaven's Gate). The first two ones talk about the Nativity of Jesus. The first one indicates people to pray for Jesus and thank him for being born while the other one informs us how Christ was born and praises Mary. The other ones tell the stories of the Three shepherds, Three Magi and of the Christmas star. The latter one, \\"Sus la poarta Raiului\\" is a portrait of the Manger during Jesus' nativity. Apart from the religious songs, there are also many other original colinde about subjects like Joy, Prosperity or Caroling itself. For example \\"Mo≈ü CrƒÉciun cu plete dalbe\\" (White-Haired Santa Claus), \\"Colindi≈£a\\", \\"Plugu≈üorul\\" or \\"ScoalƒÉ gazdƒÉ\\" (Awaken, Host). The first one talks us about Mo≈ü CrƒÉciun (literary Old Father Christmas, who is in fact Santa Claus) and his act of bringing nice children presents on Christmas day. The third and fourth ones are about specific Romanian customs to provide and maintain health or prosperity. They count some reasons for Caroling. The last one tells the story of a family where the mother wasn't able to cook colƒÉcu»õ (special Christmas pastry). They ask the host to whom they perform the colind to give them a colƒÉcu»õ, claiming their mother didn't have the tools and ingredients to make it. As we can figure out, the song was originally performed after New Year, as they claim that \\"When the oven started working, the New Year had already arrived! \\" Christmas market in Sibiu, Transylvania. Many folklore musicians covered, re-mastered or did renditions to those songs, some of them being well-known artists such as Maria TƒÉnase. Beyond traditional music, mainstream artists have also involved themselves in Christmas culture. One example is Madrigal choir who covered over 20 carols. ≈ûtefan Hru≈ücƒÉ is another Christmas music alumni who kicks off Christmas nationwide tours in late November yearly. He had also covered hundreds of songs and put them on at least three Christmas albums. Rock & Roll singer-songwriter and actor ≈ûtefan BƒÉnicƒÉ, Jr. has a now-traditional concert series to honor Christmas, ever since 2002. They are called √émpreunƒÉ de CrƒÉciun / Concert extraordinar de Craciun and take place at Sala Palatului in Bucharest. He also released a Christmas album including the top ten smash hit \\"Doar o datƒÉ e CrƒÉciunul\\" (Christmas Is Only Once). Singer Paula Seling also has two Christmas compilations ‚Äî \\"Colinde ≈üi c√¢ntece sfinte\\" (out 1998), \\"Albumul de Craciun\\" (out 2002), \\"De SƒÉrbƒÉtori\\" (out 2006) and more lately \\"A mai trecut un an\\" (Another Year Over) (out 2010). She released three music videos to promote the albums for the songs \\"O, ce veste minunatƒÉ!\\", \\"Trei pƒÉstori\\" and \\"A mai trecut un an\\". R&B; singer Andra also released a Christmas album in 2007, entitled \\"Vis de iarnƒÉ\\" (Winter Dream). The title single benefited from a music video in which Andra is traveling home to gather with her family for Christmas. Singer Elena Gheorghe also covered the song \\"Silent Night, and alongside band Mandinga released a Christmas album \\"De Craciun\\". Pop music duo Andr√© also released a Christmas EP in late 2000. It is entitled \\"Noapte de Vis\\" and it contains both Christmas-related song and other songs. The title single is also known as \\"Mo≈üule, ce t√¢nƒÉr e≈üti!\\" (How you are, Santa!) was described more as a dance-pop club hit than as a Christmas song even peaking at number-one on the Romanian Top 100. In late 2009, BƒÉnicƒÉ, Jr starred in a Christmas movie ‚Äî \\"Ho, Ho, Ho!\\". Its soundtrack was released the same year and it featured Christmas-related songs, including a Top 100 single \\"Ho, Ho, Ho!\\". It was released under MediaPro Music. Label fellow Horia Brenciu also had some Christmas hits in the Airplay Chart, for example, \\"Noapte de CrƒÉciun\\". Also in 2009, worldwide house sensation Inna released an A Side / B side digital single containing a cover of \\"O, ce veste minunatƒÉ!\\" and an original recording, \\"I Need You for Christmas\\". The latter one became the only Romanian Christmas songs to break the borders as it entered the Russian Airplay Chart and the UK Singles Chart as well as the Romanian Top 100. In 2011 LaLa Band premiered a Christmas album on December 1. A lot of compilations have been released for Christmas in Romania, for example, the \\"I Need You for Christmas\\" series. Radio station Magic FM only broadcasts Christmas songs exclusively from December 5 to January 5 starting 2008. They name themselves \\"Santa Claus' Radio Station\\". Starting in 2010, a special Airplay Chart started being shown yearly - Holiday Airplay Chart. Moreover, as a result to season's conjunction, Mariah Carey scored four entries the same week in December 2010 on the Romanian Top 100 with \\"Silent Night\\", \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" and \\"Oh Santa!\\" all charted simultaneously (the record was previously held by Michael Jackson after his death in 2009 but it was once again broken in 2011 by Rihanna (with five entries). Christmas albums are also record-breakers. In 2010 Carey's album \\"Merry Christmas II You\\" broke all records by selling over 10,000 albums in one week. The record was then broken by Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\" just to be broken once again by another Christmas album in 2011 when Justin Bieber's \\"Under the Mistletoe\\" sold over 12,000 units in one week. It was later on broken by yet another Christmas album by Michael Bubl√© simply entitled \\"Christmas\\" album that sold over 15,000 copies in a singular week. By now it is one of this year's biggest-selling albums with over 30,000 units sold in less than a month and a half.  Christmas food  During Christmas, Romanians bake or buy various special dishes, including desserts and sweets. Romanians most usually bake Cozonac (spongecake), a kind of Panetone made of flour, yolks, yeast and many other ingredients, flavors, condiments and additions. There are several types of spongecakes, with hundreds of recipes. You can either knead it for hours to be ready in 6 hours, or you can let it rise for 12 hours to avoid kneading it. You can fill the sponge cake with walnuts, cocoa, raisins, Turkish delight and in Transylvania: poppy seed paste (cozonac cu mac). Plates heaped with small pastries and cakes (corni »ôi baclava) are prepared to serve to carollers when they call. A molded vegetable and chicken salad held together with mayonnaise and decorated with olives and boiled eggs are often prepared. It is called SalatƒÉ de boeuf from the French, although it usually does not contain beef. Other Christmas dishes include piftie, sarmale, and pork dishes.

It is an attractor pattern and a descendant of both the Royal Coachman fly and the Wulff style of hair wing flies named for Lee Wulff. Origin The adoption of the hairwing patterns that eventually became the Wulff dry fly style began in the late 1920 in several locations. Although many angling writers credit Lee Wulff with the Royal Wulff, Q. L. Quackenbush, an early member of the Beaverkill Trout Club above Lew Beach in New York is often cited as the creator. In 1929‚Äì30 both Quackenbush and Wulff had independently modified the Royal Coachman pattern, particularly the Fanwing Royal Coachman with hair wings and tails. Both Wulff and Quackenbush made the modifications because the Fanwing Royal Coachman proved too flimsy and fragile on rough water. The first Quackenbush versions were tied commercially by Rube Cross and were named Quack Coachman, Hair-winged Royal Coachman and Quack Special. In the 1930s Lee Wulff collaborated with Dan Bailey during the development of his hairwing patterns and Bailey encouraged him to rename the flies. The original Ausable Gray, Coffin May and Bucktail Coachman became the Grey Wulff, White Wulff and Royal Wulff. Three additional patterns were created by the end of 1930, the Blonde Wulff, Brown Wulff and Black Wulff. The series would gain prominence after Wulff introduced them to Ray Bergman, another fly angler and outdoor writer who became the Fishing editor for Outdoor Life magazine. Bergman embraced the flies and included them his two editions of Trout (1938, 1952). Wulff considered the pattern somewhat generic and encouraged variation and evolution of the pattern instead of rigid adherence to a precise recipe. Dan Bailey, who fished regularly in Montana and eventually established a fly shop and mail order business in Livingston, Montana, in 1938 promoted the series extensively to western fly anglers. The Wulff flies, especially the Royal Wulff, are still a staple in angler's fly boxes around the world. Angler and writer John Gierach believes the Royal Wulff is one of the most popular dry patterns over the last half century.  Imitates  The Royal Wulff as a derivative of the Royal Coachman is considered an attractor pattern, or as Dave Hughes in Trout Flies-The Tier's Reference (1999) calls them‚Äîsearching patterns‚Äîas they do not resemble any specific insect or baitfish. Early in the 20th century, Theodore Gordon once was of the opinion that the Royal Coachman resembled some form of flying ant, while in the 1950s, Preston Jennings, a noted fly tier and angler thought the Royal Coachman resembled Isonychia mayflies.  Materials  The distinguishing features of Royal Coachman derivatives like the Royal Wulff are the peacock herl body partitioned with red silk or floss, a white wing and brown or red-brown hackle. The Royal Wulff is a dry fly and the wing is typical tied with white bucktail or calf tail. Tailing on the Royal Wulff is typically white or brown bucktail. They are typically tied on size 8‚Äì16 dry fly hooks.

Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. Detroit: Gale, 2003. 978-0-7876-5362-0. pp. 75-83. Only two species ‚Äì Ozobranchus margoi and Ozobranchus branchiatus ‚Äì are found in the Atlantic coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Little is known about these leeches due to difficulties in studying their sea turtle hosts.McGowin, Audrey E., et al. \\"Genetic barcoding of marine leeches (Ozobranchus spp.) from Florida sea turtles and their divergence in host specificity.\\" Molecular Ecology Resources 11.2 (2011): 271-278.  Physiology  Species of Ozobranchus spp. can be very small (down to a few millimeters in length), making them morphologically difficult to distinguish. Ozobranchus margoi and Ozobranchus branchiatus are the most anatomically documented. According to researchers from the University of Wales and the Gulf Coast Research Lab in Mississippi, the two species are very similar externally with their main difference being the number of pairs of finger-shaped gills; Ozobranchus margoi has 5 pairs while Ozobranchus branchiatus has 7.Sawyer, Roy T., Adrian R. Lawler, and Robin M. Oversrteet. \\" Marine leeches of the eastern United States and the Gulf of Mexico with a key to the species.\\" Journal of Natural History 9.6 (1975): 633-667. Both possess a light or slightly pink coloration and sometimes dark spots form from ingested blood visible through the epidermis.Davies, Ronald W. \\"The Morphology of Ozobranchus margoi (Apathy) (Hirudinoidea), a Parasite of Marine Turtles.\\" The Journal of Parasitology 64.6 (1978): 1092-1096. Ozobranchus branchiatus range generally from 3.5‚Äì10 mm, while Ozobranchus margoi generally range from 4‚Äì22 mm. The body is composed primarily of two unequal annuli. Both species have large suckers on each end of their bodies. The sucker on the anterior is not distinguishable from the neck. The anterior end also has two light-sensitive eye spots. The finger-like gills tend to get smaller as they progress towards the posterior end. Another of the species, Ozobranchus jantseanus, was studied by Japanese researchers who found it could adapt to extreme cold, surviving for 24 hours at -196 ¬∞C (-321 ¬∞F) and for nine months at -90 ¬∞C (-130 ¬∞F).  Reproduction  Like other leeches, Ozobranchus spp. are hermaphrodites with separate male and female reproductive systems. As hermaphrodites, they have both testes and ovaries. Unlike some hermaphrodites, however, leeches cannot self-fertilize. They have four pairs of testes connected to various ducts and to an external gonopore with an eversible penis controlled by a muscular bulb. The gonopore also functions as a receptacle for sperm with a connection to the ovaries. Ozobranchus spp. lay eggs like leeches. Ozobranchus branchiatus are known to lay eggs directly on their host and cementing their cocoons on the host species.  Life cycle  Due to the difficulties in studying sea turtles, relatively little is known about the life cycle of Ozobranchus spp. It is not fully understood if these leeches are capable of surviving independently of a turtle host for any extensive period of time. It is also unknown if they can feed off of organisms other than turtles, although the possibility was indicated by the discovery of a single Ozobranchus margoi specimen on a longbeaked dolphin. Ozobranchus branchiatus are known to complete their entire life cycle on host turtles, which is an unusual trait shared only by a few other species of leeches. This is accomplished by laying eggs on the turtle and attaching them with a cementing substance. The eggs will hatch and attach to the host turtle. Ozobranchus margoi has also been observed to lay eggs directly on heavily infested turtles in the event of an epizootic.Schwartz, Frank J. \\"The marine leech Ozobranchus margoi (Hirudinea: Pisciocolidae), epizootic on Chelonia and Caretta sea turtles from North Carolina.\\" The Journal of Parasitology 60.5 (1974): 889-890.  Parasitism on turtles  Blood extraction Ozobranchus branchiatus are historically known to only host on green turtles (Chelonia mydas), while Ozobranchus margoi targets multiple sea turtle species but are found mostly on loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and, in one special case, on the long-beaked common dolphin. The leeches attach themselves on the mouth, neck, cloaca, and the undersides of the flippers of turtles. Once there, they use the same technique for blood extraction as other sanguivorous leeches: opening of a small wound, usage of an anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting, and ingestion of the blood. Epizootics Occasionally, as a scientific journal reported in 1974, overwhelming infestations of leeches called \\"epizootics\\" occur. Frank J Schwartz of the University of North Carolina‚Äôs Institute of Marine Sciences described it thusly: Vector organism Apart from the direct damage they inflict on the turtles, Ozobranchus spp. are suspected by scientists to transfer diseases to turtles. Fibropapillomatosis, a neoplastic sea turtle disease associated with a turtle herpesvirus (FPTHV), is suspected to be transferred between turtles by a vector organism: specifically, Ozobranchus spp. In a study conducted by several members of Cornell University's Department of Microbiology and Immunology and United States Government employees, high viral loads of FPTHV were found in Ozobranchus spp. specimens, implicating it as a possible mechanical vector for transmission of the disease.Greenblatt, Rebecca J., et al. \\"The Ozobranchus leech is a candidate mechanical vector for the fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus found latently infecting skin tumors on Hawaiian green turtles (Chelonia mydas).\\" Virology 321.1 (2004): 101-110.  Genetic barcoding  The difficulties in applying common taxonomic techniques to identify leeches, especially to mature specimens, have led to the application of DNA barcoding using the cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI) for identification purposes. A team of scientists from Wright State University, the University of Central Florida, and the Inwater Research Group collected and analyzed several Ozobranchus margoi and Ozobranchus branchiatus leeches. The specimens were first morphologically identified based upon the number of gills. Afterwards, genomic DNA was extracted from leech tissue far from the digestive tract in order to avoid contamination from turtle host‚Äôs blood. The COI gene was sequenced from the extracted genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. These sequences were added to GenBank, which prior to the study did not have any genetic data on Ozobranchus branchiatus.

Its eastern flank, which abuts Mea Shearim Street at an intersection called Kikar HaShabbat (Sabbath Square), is the main shopping district for Haredi Jewish residents of northern Jerusalem. The remainder of the street, which extends to Sarei Yisrael Street at its western end, includes the historic Schneller Compound and numerous Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, girls' schools, and synagogues. Name The street was originally called Geula Street and was the commercial center for various pre-World War I communities such as Kerem Avraham, Yagiya Kapayim, Zikhron Moshe, Batei Horenstein, and the Achva neighborhood. The name Malkhei Yisrael (Kings of Israel) refers to the three kings of Israel, Saul, David, and Solomon. Urban commercial district A common view of the congestion in Malkhei Yisrael's commercial district. The eastern end of Malkhei Yisrael, which is the heart of the Haredi commercial district for northern Jerusalem, has been called \\"the ultra-Orthodox Oxford Street\\". Spanning approximately , and branching out into the side streets, this area is noteworthy for its huge volume of foot traffic and the high cost of commercial space - rent per square meter is equal to or greater than that of commercial space in Israel's major malls. Many stores are open from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the street is especially crowded on Thursday nights, summer nights, and the eve of Jewish holidays. Traffic on the two-lane street often comes to a standstill throughout the day, as in addition to cars and delivery trucks, bus lines serving northern Haredi neighborhoods and Rachel's Tomb ply the street. The weekday hubbub only ceases on Friday afternoon before the advent of Shabbat, while on Friday nights, Malkhei Yisrael and neighboring streets are filled with Hasidic Jews and tourists walking on foot to the various Hasidic courts in and around Geula. Morning shoppers pass the stores on Malkhei Yisrael Street. There are no indoor malls on this street; rather, the avenue is lined with dozens of small shops that sell essential consumer goods such as \\"clothes, food, school supplies, medicine, and limited luxuries\\" to the Haredi community. There are kosher music stores, kosher pizza shops, home appliance stores, falafel and juice stands, a kosher ice cream parlor, pharmacies, photo shops, a teenage novelty store, Judaica sellers,Carmeli and Applbaum, Consumption and Market Society in Israel, pp. 81-82. kosher bakeries, and a shtiebel with continuous minyanim. All food stores carry reliable hechsherim (kashrut certificates) to appeal to the Haredi clientele, which often shops with children in tow. In the weeks before Sukkot, numerous stores vacate their premises and rent their space to etrog dealers, while sidewalk vendors sell etrogs, lulavs, sukkah decorations and pictures of rabbinical figures. As a central Haredi shopping district for both locals and tourists, Malkhei Yisrael Street is also populated by a number of street beggars, some of whom have been working the street for decades.Ginsberg, Rachel. \\"Hey, Got A Shekel For A Schnorrer?: Schnorring, sticking your hand out and yelling 'tzedakah' to passersby, is actually a fine art, according to Super Schnorrer, an icon of Malchei Yisrael Street in Geula for the past 32 years. While most people would be humiliated to jangle their cup and beg, Super Schnorrer says his ego disappeared long ago - and besides, aren't all fundraisers just schnnorrers with ties?\\".

The Schneller Compound, located along the center section of Malkhei Yisrael Street behind a long stone wall, predates all of the streets and neighborhoods surrounding it. The land was purchased in 1855 by Father Johann Ludwig Schneller, a Lutheran missionary, as a family estate. Following an 1860 massacre of thousands of Maronite Christians in Lebanon and Syria by Lebanese Druze, Schneller rescued nine Christian boys and established an orphanage on his property. By the time of Schneller‚Äôs death on 18 October 1896, 1500 children had passed through the orphanage's doors. By 1903 this educational facility had grown to eight buildings and included an orphanage, a school for the blind, and vocational workshops for youth. The compound was taken over by the Turkish army as an army barracks during World War I, by the British during World War II, and by the Haganah during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After that, it was used as a base for the Israel Defense Forces and an army clinic for 60 years.Chinkis, Binyamin. \\"A Peek Behind the Gates of the Schneller Compound\\".

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae that include the genus Endemoconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones.

Ends may be formalized mathematically as equivalence classes of infinite paths, as havens describing strategies for pursuit-evasion games on the graph, or (in the case of locally finite graphs) as topological ends of topological spaces associated with the graph. Ends of graphs may be used (via Cayley graphs) to define ends of finitely generated groups. Finitely generated infinite groups have one, two, or infinitely many ends, and the Stallings theorem about ends of groups provides a decomposition for groups with more than one end. Definition and characterization Ends of graphs were defined by in terms of equivalence classes of infinite paths.However, as point out, ends of graphs were already considered by . A ' in an infinite graph is a semi-infinite simple path; that is, it is an infinite sequence of vertices v0, v1, v2, ... in which each vertex appears at most once in the sequence and each two consecutive vertices in the sequence are the two endpoints of an edge in the graph. According to Halin's definition, two rays r0 and r1 are equivalent if there is another ray r2 (not necessarily different from either of the first two rays) that contains infinitely many of the vertices in each of r0 and r1. This is an equivalence relation: each ray is equivalent to itself, the definition is symmetric with regard to the ordering of the two rays, and it can be shown to be transitive. Therefore, it partitions the set of all rays into equivalence classes, and Halin defined an end as one of these equivalence classes. An alternative definition of the same equivalence relation has also been used:E.g., this is the form of the equivalence relation used by . two rays r0 and r1 are equivalent if there is no finite set X of vertices that separates infinitely many vertices of r0 from infinitely many vertices of r1. This is equivalent to Halin's definition: if the ray r2 from Halin's definition exists, then any separator must contain infinitely many points of r2 and therefore cannot be finite, and conversely if r2 does not exist then a path that alternates as many times as possible between r0 and r1 must form the desired finite separator. Ends also have a more concrete characterization in terms of havens, functions that describe evasion strategies for pursuit-evasion games on a graph G.The haven nomenclature, and the fact that two rays define the same haven if and only if they are equivalent, is due to . proved that every haven comes from an end, completing the bijection between ends and havens, using a different nomenclature in which they called havens \\"directions\\". In the game in question, a robber is trying to evade a set of policemen by moving from vertex to vertex along the edges of G. The police have helicopters and therefore do not need to follow the edges; however the robber can see the police coming and can choose where to move next before the helicopters land. A haven is a function Œ≤ that maps each set X of police locations to one of the connected components of the subgraph formed by deleting X; a robber can evade the police by moving in each round of the game to a vertex within this component. Havens must satisfy a consistency property (corresponding to the requirement that the robber cannot move through vertices on which police have already landed): if X is a subset of Y, and both X and Y are valid sets of locations for the given set of police, then Œ≤(X) must be a superset of Œ≤(Y). A haven has order k if the collection of police locations for which it provides an escape strategy includes all subsets of fewer than k vertices in the graph; in particular, it has order ‚Ñµ0 if it maps every finite subset X of vertices to a component of G \\\\ X. Every ray in G corresponds to a haven of order ‚Ñµ0, namely, the function Œ≤ that maps every finite set X to the unique component of G \\\\ X that contains infinitely many vertices of the ray. Conversely, every haven of order ‚Ñµ0 can be defined in this way by a ray.The proof by that every haven can be defined by a ray is nontrivial and involves two cases. If the set S=\\\\bigcap_X\\\\left(\\\\beta(X)\\\\cup X\\\\right) (where X ranges over all finite sets of vertices) is infinite, then there exists a ray that passes through infinitely many vertices of S, which necessarily determines Œ≤. On the other hand, if S is finite, then show that in this case there exists a sequence of finite sets Xi that separate the end from all points whose distance from an arbitrarily chosen starting point in G \\\\ S is i. In this case, the haven is defined by any ray that is followed by a robber using the haven to escape police who land at set Xi in round i of the pursuit-evasion game. Two rays are equivalent if and only if they define the same haven, so the ends of a graph are in one-to-one correspondence with its havens of order ‚Ñµ0. Examples Part of an infinite grid graph, with vertices at the points where two grid lines meet. Despite having many different rays, it has only one end. If the infinite graph G is itself a ray, then it has infinitely many ray subgraphs, one starting from each vertex of G. However, all of these rays are equivalent to each other, so G only has one end. If G is a forest (that is, a graph with no finite cycles), then the intersection of any two rays is either a path or a ray; two rays are equivalent if their intersection is a ray. If a base vertex is chosen in each connected component of G, then each end of G contains a unique ray starting from one of the base vertices, so the ends may be placed in one-to-one correspondence with these canonical rays. Every countable graph G has a spanning forest with the same set of ends as G.More precisely, in the original formulation of this result by in which ends are defined as equivalence classes of rays, every equivalence class of rays of G contains a unique nonempty equivalence class of rays of the spanning forest. In terms of havens, there is a one-to-one correspondence of havens of order ‚Ñµ0 between G and its spanning tree T for which \\\\beta_T(X)\\\\subset \\\\beta_G(X) for every finite set X and every corresponding pair of havens Œ≤T and Œ≤G. However, there exist uncountably infinite graphs with only one end in which every spanning tree has infinitely many ends.; ; . If G is an infinite grid graph, then it has many rays, and arbitrarily large sets of vertex-disjoint rays. However, it has only one end. This may be seen most easily using the characterization of ends in terms of havens: the removal of any finite set of vertices leaves exactly one infinite connected component, so there is only one haven (the one that maps each finite set to the unique infinite connected component). Relation to topological ends In point-set topology, there is a concept of an end that is similar to, but not quite the same as, the concept of an end in graph theory, dating back much earlier to . If a topological space can be covered by a nested sequence of compact sets \\\\kappa_0\\\\subset\\\\kappa_1\\\\subset\\\\kappa_2\\\\dots, then an end of the space is a sequence of components U_0\\\\supset U_1\\\\supset U_2\\\\dots of the complements of the compact sets. This definition does not depend on the choice of the compact sets: the ends defined by one such choice may be placed in one- to-one correspondence with the ends defined by any other choice. An infinite graph G may be made into a topological space in two different but related ways: *Replacing each vertex of the graph by a point and each edge of the graph by an open unit interval produces a Hausdorff space from the graph in which a set S is defined to be open whenever each intersection of S with an edge of the graph is an open subset of the unit interval. *Replacing each vertex of the graph by a point and each edge of the graph by a point produces a non-Hausdorff space in which the open sets are the sets S with the property that, if a vertex v of G belongs to S, then so does every edge having v as one of its endpoints. In either case, every finite subgraph of G corresponds to a compact subspace of the topological space, and every compact subspace corresponds to a finite subgraph together with, in the Hausdorff case, finitely many compact proper subsets of edges. Thus, a graph may be covered by a nested sequence of compact sets if and only if it is locally finite, having a finite number of edges at every vertex. If a graph G is connected and locally finite, then it has a compact cover in which the set Œ∫i is the set of vertices at distance at most i from some arbitrarily chosen starting vertex. In this case any haven Œ≤ defines an end of the topological space in which U_i=\\\\beta(\\\\kappa_i). And conversely, if U_0\\\\supset U_1\\\\supset U_2\\\\dots is an end of the topological space defined from G, it defines a haven in which Œ≤(X) is the component containing Ui, where i is any number large enough that Œ∫i contains X. Thus, for connected and locally finite graphs, the topological ends are in one-to-one correspondence with the graph-theoretic ends.. For graphs that may not be locally finite, it is still possible to define a topological space from the graph and its ends. This space can be represented as a metric space if and only if the graph has a normal spanning tree, a rooted spanning tree such that each graph edge connects an ancestor-descendant pair. If a normal spanning tree exists, it has the same set of ends as the given graph: each end of the graph must contain exactly one infinite path in the tree. Special kinds of ends Free ends An end E of a graph G is defined to be a free end if there is a finite set X of vertices with the property that X separates E from all other ends of the graph. (That is, in terms of havens, Œ≤E(X) is disjoint from Œ≤D(X) for every other end D.) In a graph with finitely many ends, every end must be free. proves that, if G has infinitely many ends, then either there exists an end that is not free, or there exists an infinite family of rays that share a common starting vertex and are otherwise disjoint from each other. Thick ends A thick end of a graph G is an end that contains infinitely many pairwise-disjoint rays. Halin's grid theorem characterizes the graphs that contain thick ends: they are exactly the graphs that have a subdivision of the hexagonal tiling as a subgraph.; . Special kinds of graphs Symmetric and almost-symmetric graphs defines a connected locally finite graph to be \\"almost symmetric\\" if there exist a vertex v and a number D such that, for every other vertex w, there is an automorphism of the graph for which the image of v is within distance D of w; equivalently, a connected locally finite graph is almost symmetric if its automorphism group has finitely many orbits. As he shows, for every connected locally finite almost-symmetric graph, the number of ends is either at most two or uncountable; if it is uncountable, the ends have the topology of a Cantor set. Additionally, Mohar shows that the number of ends controls the Cheeger constant :h=\\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{V}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where V ranges over all finite nonempty sets of vertices of the graph and where \\\\partial V denotes the set of edges with one endpoint in V. For almost-symmetric graphs with uncountably many ends, h > 0; however, for almost-symmetric graphs with only two ends, h = 0\\\\. Cayley graphs The Cayley graph of the free group on two generators a and b. The ends of the group are in one-to-one correspondence with the rays (infinite paths) from the identity element e to the fringes of the drawing. Every group and a set of generators for the group determine a Cayley graph, a graph whose vertices are the group elements and the edges are pairs of elements (x,gx) where g is one of the generators. In the case of a finitely generated group, the ends of the group are defined to be the ends of the Cayley graph for the finite set of generators; this definition is invariant under the choice of generators, in the sense that if two different finite set of generators are chosen, the ends of the two Cayley graphs are in one-to-one correspondence with each other. For instance, every free group has a Cayley graph (for its free generators) that is a tree. The free group on one generator has a doubly infinite path as its Cayley graph, with two ends. Every other free group has infinitely many ends. Every finitely generated infinite group has either 1, 2, or infinitely many ends, and the Stallings theorem about ends of groups provides a decomposition of groups with more than one end.. In particular: # A finitely generated infinite group has 2 ends if and only if it has a cyclic subgroup of finite index. # A finitely generated infinite group has infinitely many ends if and only if it is either a nontrivial free product with amalgamation or HNN- extension with finite amalgamation. # All other finitely generated infinite groups have exactly one end.

C. 1991. Quantitative description and development of a species-specific growth form for largemouth bass, with application to the relative weight index. Master's thesis, Texas A&M; University, College Station. and burbotFisher, S., D. Willis, and K. Pope. 1996. An assessment of burbot (Lota lota) weight-length data from North American populations. Canadian Journal of Zoology 74:570-575(fish). Standard weight in fish is the typical or expected weight at a given total length for a specific species of fish. Most standard weight equations are for freshwater fish species. Weight-length curves are developed by weighing and measuring samples of fish from the population. Methods of obtaining such samples include creel surveys, or measurements of fish caught by commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen and/or by the researchers themselves. Some scientists use cast nets, trotlines, or other means to catch many individual fish at once for measurement. To determine a standard weight equation, several data sets or weight-length relationships representing a species across its range are used. As fish grow in length, they increase in weight. The relationship between weight and length is not linear. The relationship between length (L) and weight (W) can be expressed as: :W = aL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, When the equation is for standard weight, the standard weight for a given length is written as Ws. The exponent b is close to 3.0 for most species. The coefficient a varies between species. If the exponent b is greater than three for a certain fish species, that species tends to become relatively fatter or have more girth as it grows longer. For largemouth bass, the value of b is 3.273. If the exponent b is less than three for a certain fish species, that species tends to be more streamlined. For burbot, the value of b is 2.898.R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996 While the standard weight for a largemouth bass that is 500 mm long is about 2 kg, the standard weight for a burbot that is 500 mm long is only about 0.9 kg. Standard weight curves are often based on the 75th percentile weight data rather than the average of all the data available. Murphy et al. (1991) suggested that it is preferable that standard weight equations represent the entire geographical range of a species, and that they be used for comparison purposes rather than management targets.Murphy, B. R., Willis, D.W., and Springer, T.A The Relative Weight Index in Fisheries Management: Status and Needs. Fisheries, 16(2):30-38, 1991 Practically, weight-length equations are often developed for sub-populations from specific geographic areas, but these are different from standard weight relationships. Factors affecting standard weight  Example of fish length measurements. For standard weight equations, the total length is used. This fish is a tarpon. Length measurements reported for fish may be of the fish's total length, fork length, or maximum standard length. For standard weight equations, the total length is used. In some species, male and female fish have different standard weight curves. For example, Anderson and Neumann report different standard weight equations for male and female paddlefish.R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996 Some researchers have also reported separate standard weight equations when a species has lentic (living in still water) and lotic (living in flowing water) populations. For example, separate standard weight equations have been published for lentic and lotic rainbow trout.Simpkins, D. G. and W. A. Hubert. Proposed revision of the standard weight equation for rainbow trout. Journal of Freshwater Ecology 11:319-326, 1996 Applications Standard weight is used as a basis for comparison to assess the health of an individual or group of fish. Generally, fish that are heavier than the standard weight for their length are considered healthier, having more energy reserves for normal activities, growth and reproduction.Ogle, D. FishR Vignette - Fish Condition and Relative Weights, June, 2013 Northland College Fish may weigh less than expected for their length for many reasons, and a scientist must consider more information before assigning a cause. One of the simplest reasons is lack of food/prey. Lack of prey in turn could be the result of overpopulation of the predator, for example, competition from another predator species, unsuitability of the environment for reproduction of the prey, or dying of the prey for some reason. A fish may also weigh less than expected due to a change in activity level or metabolism due to some environmental factor. Standard weight equations, together with some measure of a fish's condition, can be used in aquaculture to measure the effectiveness of various feeding, temperature control, containment or other practices. The actual measure of a fish's condition using standard weight is done different ways. The relative weight (Wr) of an individual fish is its actual weight divided by its standard weight, times 100%.Wege, G. W. and R. O. Anderson. 1978. Relative weight (Wr): A new index of condition for largemouth bass. In G. D. Novinger and J. G. Dillard (editors), New Approaches to the Management of Small Impoundments, Special Publication, volume 5, pp. 79-91, American Fisheries Society A fish of \\"normal\\" weight has a relative weight of 100 percent. The relative weight of a fish does not indicate its health on a continuous scale from 0 -100%, however. For example, Simpkins et al. found that juvenile rainbow trout with a condition index of less than 80% were at a high risk of dying.Simpkins, D.G., Hubert, W.A., Martinez Del Rio, C., Rule, D.C., Physiological responses of juvenile rainbow trout to fasting and swimming activity: effects on body composition and condition indexes.

Fisheries 31:5, 236-238, 2006 Proposed by Fulton in 1904, it assumes that the standard weight of a fish is proportional to the cube of its length: K = 100(W/L^3)\\\\\\\\!\\\\, where W is the whole body wet weight in grams and L is the length in centimeters; the factor 100 is used to bring K close to a value of one.

Throws and choking moves can also be made at appropriate spots in the match. Once all three icons are red, the player automatically loses the fight. The arena is surrounded by an electric fence that can either be used for an attack or as a way to initiate a jump attack. It very difficult to pull off a close attack from behind. However, these attacks have the distinct advantage of being irreversible by the opponent. Regular matches are like exhibitions while tournaments are more like role-playing games where the player's chosen beast/dragon is weak and has to power up by defeating stronger foes. A store can be visited which provided strength-increasing food between fights in the arena. Diskettes containing the vital statistics of the different monsters, dragons, and miscellaneous beasts can also be found. They provide vital knowledge needed to defeat future opponents.

He also served as a pioneering member of Grayson County, Texas in which he also served as a Sheriff and tax collector. Ancestry The Reeves family was of English ancestry with Lord Robert Ryves (birth name Reve) (pronounced Reeves) (1490-1551), owning two primary estates, Randleston purchased in 1545 and Damory Court in Blandford Forum in 1548. George Reeves's 9th great grandfather purchased both of these properties from Henry VIII of England as a member of the King's court. Lord Ryves made his living primarily in wool and textiles and is buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Church in Blandford Forum, Dorset, England. = Colonel Reeves's 5th great grandfather, Timothy Riveshttps://thereevesproject.org/data/tiki- index.php?page=Rives_Timothy_RR51ID206, immigrated from England to Virginia, USA, in the mid 1600s, and within a few generations the family would leave Virginia and move west, settling in Tennessee. Oral history of the Reeves family indicates that Colonel Reeves's father, William Steele Reeves (1794-1872), was very close to, if not partially raised by his aunt, Charlotte Reeves and her husband, General James Robertson. General Robertson was commissioned as a United States military officer by President George Washington and was the co-founder of Fort Nashborough in Tennessee, later named Nashville. William is listed as a family member in the James Robertson family bible. Personal life George Robertson Reeves was born in Hickman County, Tennessee. He married Jane Moore in 1844 while living in Arkansas, and between them had 12 children, with seven surviving his death in 1882. Jane Moore's great great grandfather was noted pioneer and co-founder of what is now the State of Tennessee, Colonel William Bean, an acquaintance of famous frontiersmen Daniel Boone and David Crockett. Bean was a founding member of the Watauga Association. Jane Moore's great grandfather, Jesse Bean, was purported to have made several rifles from his black-smithing cave in Caney Hollow Branch, Franklin County, Tennessee and it is suspected that one of those rifles was used at the Battle of the Alamo and now resides in its museum. Moore's great uncle, Russell Bean, was the first white child born in what is now the state of Tennessee. George Robertson Reeves donated 10 acres of land in Pottsboro, Texas to establish Georgetown Cemetery. His infant daughter, Mary, was the first to be buried there. One of Reeves's youngest sons, Alvin Robertson Reeves (1872-1946), was awarded the 1938 Pugsley Medal (Bronze) for his work as the director of the Division of State Parks in Oklahoma. Alvin Reeves was responsible for drafting the bill in the State of Oklahoma establishing the State Game and Fish Commission. As state game warden, Reeves purchased the first sites later to be designated state parks in Oklahoma. Career and accomplishments In addition to farming, one of Reeves first occupations in Grayson County, Texas was that of tax collector (1848-1850). Public service suited him enough that he became the Sheriff of Grayson County, Texas in 1850 and served until 1854. Original Flag of the Texas 11th Cavalry, Camp Reeves. Texas Civil War Museum, Ft. Worth, Texas Historical Marker to 11th Texas Cavalry, Sherman, Texas In May 1861 with the first shots of the Civil War at Fort Sumpter less than a month old, Reeves organized a company within the 11th Regiment of the Texas Cavalry. Despite Grayson County voting against secession from the northern states, Texas as a whole voted to join the Confederacy. Reeves then donated land which would be used as Camp Reeves in support of the 11th Texas Cavalry and the Confederate States cause. Reeves, a Captain, was promoted to Colonel after the death of the Regiment's first Commander, William C. Young. While the 11th had a handful of commanding officers, none served the 11th as its leader longer than Colonel George R. Reeves. The Texas 11th Cavalry during the course of the war was involved in approximately 150 battles and skirmishes. One report said that as many as 500 men fought and less than 50 returned home at the end of the war. Among the biggest battles in which Reeves commanded the 11th Cav was the Chattanooga Campaign, Wheeler's Raid through middle Tennessee, the Atlanta Campaign, the Knoxville Campaign, and the Battle of Chickamauga, the last being the second bloodiest battle of the war behind only Gettysburg, and the largest battle victory for the Confederate States. The 11th Texas Cavalary, during most of its military history, reported to Reeves's good friend and fellow Texan, General John A. Wharton and up to Georgian Joseph \\"Fighting Joe\\" Wheeler. Reeves resigned his commission shortly before the end of the war due to conflicts with commanding officers. His resignation letter stated differences between him and his Brigade Commander and that \\"I feel that I could more efficiently serve my country in some other capacity than the one I occupy now.\\" His resignation was signed off by Major General Joseph Wheeler and eventually sent to the Secretary of War, James Seddon. Back in Texas Reeves became active in various post-war veteran's activities as well as the Old Settlers' Association in Grayson County. Reeves was elected to the Texas State Legislature in 1866, 1873, 1878, and 1880. In 1881 he became the Speaker of the House of Representatives for the State of Texas. Under his watch as Speaker of the House, the legislature helped to found the University of Texas in Austin. Death and legacy In 1882 while visiting home, Reeves was bitten by a rabid dog. Reeves family oral history states that he saw a young child in danger from the animal and jumped off his horse to protect the young one when he was bitten. In his remaining days, Reeves was placed in a wooden shed padded with mattresses to protect him from the potential self-inflicted violent tendencies associated with the disease. He died of hydrophobia in September 1882, only three years before Louis Pasteur and Emile Roux discovered a vaccine for rabies. He is buried on the land he once owned, Georgetown Cemetery in Pottsboro, Texas. Highway Marker, Reeves County, Texas Two years after his death, a 2,642 square mile county in West Texas was renamed for Reeves. Reeves County, Texas is the home to the city of Pecos, Texas its county seat. In addition, the Masonic Lodge in Pottsboro was named after the former politician and soldier, as is the Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp #349 in the Sherman/Denison, Texas area. Several of Colonel Reeves's relatives still live in Grayson County as well as Tyler and Dallas, Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and California.

In a classical scattering system there will be one or more impact parameters, b, in which a particle is sent into the scatterer. This gives rise to one or more exit parameters, y, as the particle exits towards infinity. While the particle is traversing the system, there may also be a delay time, T‚Äîthe time it takes for the particle to exit the system‚Äîin addition to the distance travelled, s, which in certain systems, i.e., \\"billiard-like\\" systems in which the particle undergoes lossless collisions with hard, fixed objects, the two will be equivalent‚Äîsee below. In a chaotic scattering system, a minute change in the impact parameter, may give rise to a very large change in the exit parameters. Gaspard‚ÄìRice system Fig. 1: Diagram of Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system showing major parameters. An excellent example system is the \\"Gaspard‚ÄìRice\\" (GR) scattering system ‚Äîalso known simply as the \\"three-disc\\" system‚Äîwhich embodies many of the important concepts in chaotic scattering while being simple and easy to understand and simulate. The concept is very simple: we have three hard discs arranged in some triangular formation, a point particle is sent in and undergoes perfect, elastic collisions until it exits towards infinity. In this discussion, we will only consider GR systems having equally sized discs, equally spaced around the points of an equilateral triangle. Figure 1 illustrates this system while Figure 2 shows two example trajectories. Note first that the trajectories bounce around the system for some time before finally exiting. Note also, that if we consider the impact parameters to be the start of the two perfectly horizontal lines at left (the system is completely reversible: the exit point could also be the entry point), the two trajectories are initially so close as to be almost identical. By the time they exit, they are completely different, thus illustrating the strong sensitivity to initial conditions. This system will be used as an example throughout the article. Fig. 2: Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system showing sensitivity to initial conditions. Decay rate If we introduce a large number of particles with uniformly distributed impact parameters, the rate at which they exit the system is known as the decay rate. We can calculate the decay rate by simulating the system over many trials and forming a histogram of the delay time, T. For the GR system, it is easy to see that the delay time and the length of the particle trajectory are equivalent but for a multiplication coefficient. A typical choice for the impact parameter is the y-coordinate, while the trajectory angle is kept constant at zero degrees‚Äîhorizontal. Meanwhile, we say that the particle has \\"exited the system\\" once it passes a border some arbitrary, but sufficiently large, distance from the centre of the system. We expect the number of particles remaining in the system, N(T), to vary as: : N(T) \\\\sim e^{-\\\\gamma T} Thus the decay rate, \\\\gamma, is given as: : \\\\gamma= \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} - \\\\frac{\\\\ln N(T)}{T} where n is the total number of particles. Figure 3 shows a plot of the path-length versus the number of particles for a simulation of one million (1e6) particles started with random impact parameter, b. A fitted straight line of negative slope, \\\\gamma=0.739 is overlaid. The path-length, s, is equivalent to the decay time, T, provided we scale the (constant) speed appropriately. Note that an exponential decay rate is a property specifically of hyperbolic chaotic scattering. Non-hyperbolic scatterers may have an arithmetic decay rate. Fig. 3: Decay rate of the Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system. An experimental system and the stable manifold thumbupright=1rightFig. 4: An experimental Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system. Figure 4 shows an experimental realization of the Gaspard‚ÄìRice system using a laser instead of a point particle. As anyone who's actually tried this knows, this is not a very effective method of testing the system‚Äîthe laser beam gets scattered in every direction. As shown by Sweet, Ott and Yorke, a more effective method is to direct coloured light through the gaps between the discs (or in this case, tape coloured strips of paper across pairs of cylinders) and view the reflections through an open gap. The result is a complex pattern of stripes of alternating colour, as shown below, seen more clearly in the simulated version below that. Figures 5 and 6 show the basins of attraction for each impact parameter, b, that is, for a given value of b, through which gap does the particle exit? The basin boundaries form a Cantor set and represent members of the stable manifold: trajectories that, once started, never exit the system. Fig. 5: An experimental Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system showing basins of attraction. thumbupright=2centerFig 6: Simulation of the Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system showing basins of attraction. The invariant set and the symbolic dynamics Fig. 7: Possible variables to represent the Gaspard‚ÄìRice system as an iterated function map. So long as it is symmetric, we can easily think of the system as an iterated function map, a common method of representing a chaotic, dynamical system. Figure 7 shows one possible representation of the variables, with the first variable, \\\\theta \\\\in [-\\\\pi, \\\\pi], representing the angle around the disc at rebound and the second, \\\\phi \\\\in [-\\\\pi/2, \\\\pi/2], representing the impact/rebound angle relative to the disc. A subset of these two variables, called the invariant set will map onto themselves. This set, four members of which are shown in Figures 8 and 9, will be fractal, totally non-attracting and of measure zero. This is an interesting inversion of the more normally discussed chaotic systems in which the fractal invariant set is attracting and in fact comprises the basin[s] of attraction. Note that the totally non-attracting nature of the invariant set is another property of a hyperbolic chaotic scatterer. Fig. 8: Four members of the invariant set of the Gaspard‚ÄìRice system. Fig. 9: Four members of the invariant set of the Gaspard‚ÄìRice system, iterated forward in time. Each member of the invariant set can be modelled using symbolic dynamics: the trajectory is labelled based on each of the discs off of which it rebounds. The set of all such sequences form an uncountable set. For the four members shown in Figures 8 and 9, the symbolic dynamics will be as follows: ...121212121212... ...232323232323... ...313131313131... ...123123123123... Members of the stable manifold may be likewise represented, except each sequence will have a starting point. When you consider that a member of the invariant set must \\"fit\\" in the boundaries between two basins of attraction, it is apparent that, if perturbed, the trajectory may exit anywhere along the sequence. Thus it should also be apparent that an infinite number of alternating basins of all three \\"colours\\" will exist between any given boundary. Because of their unstable nature, it is difficult to access members of the invariant set or the stable manifold directly. The uncertainty exponent is ideally tailored to measure the fractal dimension of this type of system. Once again using the single impact parameter, b, we perform multiple trials with random impact parameters, perturbing them by a minute amount, \\\\epsilon, and counting how frequently the number of rebounds off the discs changes, that is, the uncertainty fraction. Note that even though the system is two dimensional, a single impact parameter is sufficient to measure the fractal dimension of the stable manifold. This is demonstrated in Figure 10, which shows the basins of attraction plotted as a function of a dual impact parameter, \\\\theta and \\\\phi. The stable manifold, which can be seen in the boundaries between the basins, is fractal along only one dimension. thumbupright=2centerFig. 10: The basins of attraction as a function of the dual impact parameters, \\\\theta and \\\\phi. Figure 11 plots the uncertainty fraction, f, as a function of the uncertainty, \\\\epsilon for a simulated Gaspard‚ÄìRice system. The slope of the fitted curve returns the uncertainty exponent, \\\\gamma=0.380, thus the box-counting dimension of the stable manifold is, D_0=N-\\\\gamma=2-0.380=1.62. The invariant set is the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds. Since the system is the same whether run forwards or backwards, the unstable manifold is simply the mirror image of the stable manifold and their fractal dimensions will be equal. On this basis we can calculate the fractal dimension of the invariant set: : D = D_s + D_u - N = 2 D_s - N = N - 2 \\\\gamma where D_s and D_u are the fractal dimensions of the stable and unstable manifolds, respectively and N=2 is the dimensionality of the system. The fractal dimension of the invariant set is D=1.24. Fig. 10: Plot of the uncertainty fraction of the Gaspard‚ÄìRice scattering system, with straight line fit, giving uncertainty exponent. Relationship between the fractal dimension, decay rate and Lyapunov exponents From the preceding discussion, it should be apparent that the decay rate, the fractal dimension and the Lyapunov exponents are all related. The large Lyapunov exponent, for instance, tells us how fast a trajectory in the invariant set will diverge if perturbed. Similarly, the fractal dimension will give us information about the density of orbits in the invariant set. Thus we can see that both will affect the decay rate as captured in the following conjecture for a two-dimensional scattering system: : D_1 = \\\\left (h_1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{h_1} - \\\\frac{1}{h_2} \\\\right ) where D1 is the information dimension and h1 and h2 are the small and large Lyapunov exponents, respectively. For an attractor, \\\\gamma=\\\\infty and it reduces to the Kaplan‚ÄìYorke conjecture.

BAN devices may be embedded inside the body as implants, may be surface-mounted on the body in a fixed position, or may be accompanied devices which humans can carry in different positions, such as in clothes pockets, by hand, or in various bags. While there is a trend towards the miniaturization of devices, in particular, body area networks consist of several miniaturized body sensor units (BSUs) together with a single body central unit (BCU), larger decimeter (tab and pad) sized smart devices still play an important role in terms of acting as a data hub or data gateway and providing a user interface to view and manage BAN applications, in-situ. The development of WBAN technology started around 1995 around the idea of using wireless personal area network (WPAN) technologies to implement communications on, near, and around the human body. About six years later, the term \\"BAN\\" came to refer to systems where communication is entirely within, on, and in the immediate proximity of a human body. A WBAN system can use WPAN wireless technologies as gateways to reach longer ranges. Through gateway devices, it is possible to connect the wearable devices on the human body to the internet. This way, medical professionals can access patient data online using the internet independent of the patient location. Concept The rapid growth in physiological sensors, low-power integrated circuits, and wireless communication has enabled a new generation of wireless sensor networks, now used for purposes such as monitoring traffic, crops, infrastructure, and health. The body area network field is an interdisciplinary area which could allow inexpensive and continuous health monitoring with real-time updates of medical records through the Internet. A number of intelligent physiological sensors can be integrated into a wearable wireless body area network, which can be used for computer- assisted rehabilitation or early detection of medical conditions. This area relies on the feasibility of implanting very small biosensors inside the human body that are comfortable and that don't impair normal activities. The implanted sensors in the human body will collect various physiological changes in order to monitor the patient's health status no matter their location. The information will be transmitted wirelessly to an external processing unit. This device will instantly transmit all information in real time to the doctors throughout the world. If an emergency is detected, the physicians will immediately inform the patient through the computer system by sending appropriate messages or alarms. Currently the level of information provided and energy resources capable of powering the sensors are limiting. While the technology is still in its primitive stage it is being widely researched and once adopted, is expected to be a breakthrough invention in healthcare, leading to concepts like telemedicine and mHealth becoming real. Applications Initial applications of BANs are expected to appear primarily in the healthcare domain, especially for continuous monitoring and logging vital parameters of patients suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma and heart attacks. * A BAN in place on a patient can alert the hospital, even before they have a heart attack, through measuring changes in their vital signs. * A BAN on a diabetic patient could auto inject insulin through a pump, as soon as their insulin level declines. * A BAN can be used, to learn the underlying health state transitions and dynamics of a disease Other applications of this technology include sports, military, or security. Extending the technology to new areas could also assist communication by seamless exchanges of information between individuals, or between individuals and machines. Standards The latest international standard for BANs is the IEEE 802.15.6 standard.IEEE P802.15.6-2012 Standard for Wireless Body Area Networks Components A typical BAN or BSN requires vital sign monitoring sensors, motion detectors (through accelerometers) to help identify the location of the monitored individual and some form of communication, to transmit vital sign and motion readings to medical practitioners or care givers. A typical body area network kit will consist of sensors, a Processor, a transceiver and a battery. Physiological sensors, such as ECG and SpO2 sensors, have been developed. Other sensors such as a blood pressure sensor, EEG sensor and a PDA for BSN interface are under development.http://vip.doc.ic.ac.uk/bsn/m621.html Wireless communication in the U.S. The FCC has approved the allocation of 40 MHz of spectrum bandwidth for medical BAN low-power, wide-area radio links at the 2360‚Äì2400 MHz band. This will allow off-loading MBAN communication from the already saturated standard Wi-Fi spectrum to a standard band. The 2360‚Äì2390 MHz frequency range is available on a secondary basis. The FCC will expand the existing Medical Device Radiocommunication (MedRadio) Service in Part 95 of its rules. MBAN devices using the band will operate under a ‚Äòlicense-by-rule‚Äô basis which eliminates the need to apply for individual transmitter licenses. Usage of the 2360‚Äì2390 MHz frequencies are restricted to indoor operation at health-care facilities and are subject to registration and site approval by coordinators to protect aeronautical telemetry primary usage. Operation in the 2390‚Äì2400 MHz band is not subject to registration or coordination and may be used in all areas including residential. Challenges Problems with the use of this technology could include: * Data Quality: Data generated and collected through BANs can play a key role in the patient care process. It is essential that the quality of this data is of a high standard to ensure that the decisions made are based on the best information possible * Data Management: As BANs generate large volumes of data, the need to manage and maintain these datasets is of utmost importance.Lai, D. , Begg, R.K. and Palaniswami, M. eds, Healthcare Sensor Networks: Challenges towards practical implementation , , 2011 * Sensor Validation: Pervasive sensing devices are subject to inherent communication and hardware constraints including unreliable wired/wireless network links, interference and limited power reserves. This may result in erroneous datasets being transmitted back to the end user. It is of the utmost importance especially within a healthcare domain that all sensor readings are validated. This helps to reduce false alarm generation and to identify possible weaknesses within the hardware and software design. * Data Consistency: Data residing on multiple mobile devices and wireless patient notes need to be collected and analysed in a seamless fashion. Within body area networks, vital patient datasets may be fragmented over a number of nodes and across a number of networked PCs or Laptops. If a medical practitioner‚Ä≤s mobile device does not contain all known information then the quality of patient care may degrade. * Security: Considerable effort would be required to make WBAN transmission secure and accurate. It would have to be made sure that the patient ‚Äò'secure‚Äò‚Äô data is only derived from each patient's dedicated WBAN system and is not mixed up with other patient's data. Further, the data generated from WBAN should have secure and limited access. Although security is a high priority in most networks, little study has been done in this area for WBANs. As WBANs are resource-constrained in terms of power, memory, communication rate and computational capability, security solutions proposed for other networks may not be applicable to WBANs. Confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and freshness of data together with availability and secure management are the security requirements in WBAN. The IEEE 802.15.6 standard, which is latest standard for WBAN, tried to provide security in WBAN. However, it has several security problems. * Interoperability: WBAN systems would have to ensure seamless data transfer across standards such as Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. to promote information exchange, plug and play device interaction. Further, the systems would have to be scalable, ensure efficient migration across networks and offer uninterrupted connectivity. * System devices: The sensors used in WBAN would have to be low on complexity, small in form factor, light in weight, power efficient, easy to use and reconfigurable. Further, the storage devices need to facilitate remote storage and viewing of patient data as well as access to external processing and analysis tools via the Internet. * Energy vs. accuracy: Sensors' activation policy should be determined to optimizing the trade-off between the BAN's power consumption versus the probability of patient's health state mis-classification. High power consumption often results in more accurate observations on the patient's health state and vice versa. * Invasion of privacy: People might consider the WBAN technology as a potential threat to freedom, if the applications go beyond \\"secure\\" medical usage. Social acceptance would be key to this technology finding a wider application. * Interference: The wireless link used for body sensors should reduce the interference and increase the coexistence of sensor node devices with other network devices available in the environment. This is especially important for large scale implementation of WBAN systems.Garcia P., \\"A Methodology for the Deployment of Sensor Networks\\", IEEE Transactions On Knowledge And Data Engineering, vol. 11, no. 4, December 2011. *Cost: Today's consumers expect low cost health monitoring solutions which provide high functionality. WBAN implementations will need to be cost optimized to be appealing alternatives to health conscious consumers. *Constant monitoring: Users may require different levels of monitoring, for example those at risk of cardiac ischemia may want their WBANs to function constantly, while others at risk of falls may only need WBANs to monitor them while they are walking or moving. The level of monitoring influences the amount of energy required and the life cycle of the BAN before the energy source is depleted. *Constrained deployment: The WBAN needs to be wearable, lightweight and non intrusive. It should not alter or encumber the user's daily activities. The technology should ultimately be transparent to the user i.e., it should perform its monitoring tasks without the user realising it. *Consistent performance: The performance of the WBAN should be consistent. Sensor measurements should be accurate and calibrated, even when the WBAN is switched off and switched on again.https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/misl/2009publications/pervasive09.pdf The wireless links should be robust and work under various user environments.

The 1742 church was demolished in 1872 and replaced with the present church building. The new church was built slightly to the south of where the previous church stood. There was a cemetery located on the church grounds for centuries, but it has not been used since 1886 when a new cemetery was established to the northeast of the church.

Lorien Legacies I am Number Four \\"I Am Number Four\\" is the first book in the Lorien Legacies series. It introduces readers to the Loric, a nearly extinct race of extraterrestrials, due to a deadly battle with their enemies-the Mogadorians, with the few survivors being nine teenagers and their corresponding guardians, C√™pans. Another alien race, the Mogadorians, wiped out the majority of the Loric, except for those who escaped to Earth. Now the Mogadorians have come to finish the job. Numbers one, two, and three have already been killed, causing three circular brands to appear on the ankles of the remaining Loric. The book is told from the perspective of Number Four, also known as John Smith. John is the next target for the Mogadorians, who must kill the Loric in the order of their numbers. He and his C√™pan, Henri, move from place to place, changing their identities to keep hidden. John begins inheriting Legacies, the ancestral right of special Loric known as Garde, and must learn to keep his powers hidden from his human friends. John befriends a human named Sam Goode, whose father happened to have helped the Loriens when they first arrived then later mysteriously disappeared. John slowly falls in love with Sarah Hart, a beautiful girl who does photography for her website, ‚ÄúStrangers In Paradise‚Äù. John goes home to find the website and sees a few pictures of him disappear with a deleted status. John and Sarah soon begin dating and forming a very close bond. Later on, John and Sarah return to their high school to discover that the Mogs have found them. John is trying to get Sarah and himself out of harm's way when Number Six appears out of nowhere and kills two Mogs in a matter of seconds. Together they work their way through the school, killing the Mog commander sent after John. However, Henri dies in the process, informing John of a secret letter explaining everything about their mission. The school is half destroyed, attracting social media and police officers. Now John, Six, and Sam are on the run to avoid the Mogadorians, leaving Sarah behind. The Power Of Six The story is told by two members of the Garde: Number Seven (Marina), who is hiding at a convent in Spain, and Number Four (John Smith), who is on the run with Sam, Number Six, and Bernie Kosar (John Smith's Chim√¶ra). While John, Six and Sam try to stay ahead of the Mogadorians while searching for the other surviving Loric, Marina searches for news of John after his heroic battle at the school that came at the end of I Am Number Four. Marina is living at a convent with her C√™pan (Adelina) when a Mogadorian discovers her location then continuously spies on her. This increased risk moves her priority of finding Four to the top of the list. A 7-year-old girl named Ella moves to the orphanage and Marina befriends her, asking her to help find her Chest. Meanwhile, Marina tries to convince her C√™pan to help open her Loric Chest and take responsibility for her role as C√™pan, but to no avail. Ella soon finds the hidden Chest, and she and Marina retrieve it after a scuffle with four girls from the convent. During this fight Ella breaks her arm, and Marina discovers her healing legacy. Later, Marina drugs Adelina and finally gets her Chest open. Elsewhere, John, Six, BK (Bernie Kosar), and Sam continue evading the police. After being pursued by the police one night, John finally decides to open his Chest, which contains the letter Henri gave him. Once everybody takes a look at the contents, they discover the items leave them clueless. However, one object notified the Mogadorians of their location, and provoked an attack on the house, where they narrowly escape. Later, John reads Henri's letter and finds out the Mogadorians have captured Sam's father. Sam remembers his father telling him of a secret Lorien base in his backyard, and they set off to find it. Upon finding it, they are intercepted by Mogadorians, and the party splits up: Six and BK stay and fight, while John and Sam search the base. Once receiving the base's contents, John and Sam flee, ending up very close to Sarah's house. When John and Sarah meet, the FBI appear and arrest John, putting him and Sam in a prison near Washington DC. They suspect Sarah had notified the FBI before they met up. As Mogadorians catch up to John and Sam in prison, Six helps them escape, though she is very angry they left her during the battle in Paradise. After escaping, she shows them an image on the internet where someone has burned loric symbols onto a mountain in Spain. Soon they decide on a plan: Six will go to Spain to help the newly discovered Marina (Number seven), and Sam, BK, and John will go to the Mogadorian's base in a hollowed-out mountain near West Virginia to retrieve John's chest. As soon as Marina opens her chest, the Mogadorians are notified and catch up with Marina and Adelina as they try to escape the convent. Marina and Adelina are surprised to learn that Ella is Loric, and the stalker Mogadorian following Marina is actually Ella's Cepan (Crayton). During the chaos, Adelina is murdered while trying to help Marina. Marina, after being saved by Crayton and Ella, learns that Ella is the tenth member of the Garde. She escaped on a second ship, and has disguised herself by age-shifting. Together, they all escape to a lake where Crayton has a Chim√¶ra waiting to help them. As they battle the Mogadorians at the lake, Six arrives at the scene and helps them win the battle. Afterwards, Six makes plans with the others to find the other Garde and the rest of the Chim√¶ras. However, Crayton warns that their successes in battle will alert the Mogadorian ruler, Setr√°kus Ra, to join the fight. Meanwhile, Sam and John use a stone from John's chest to transfer Six's invisibility to them and sneak into the Mogadorian mountain base. They grab both John's Chest and another, which turns out to be that of Nine, who is imprisoned in the mountain. They run out of invisibility, but manage to free Nine and escape the mountain with everyone but Sam, who was caught and had to be left behind. Setr√°kus Ra arrives, and as Nine is about to attack him, he hides in the base, unreachable. Nine, John, and BK head north, with nowhere to go since the address for meeting Six was in Sam's pocket. The Rise of Nine The Rise of Nine, the 3rd book of The Lorien Legacies, was released on August 21, 2012. John and Nine escape from the Mogadorian base and head to Chicago, where Nine's penthouse is located. Meanwhile, Six, Seven, Ella, and Crayton go to the Himalayas in India to meet up with Number Eight. A battle commences between the Garde and the Mogadorians. Crayton dies and Eight teleports himself and the girls away from the Loric cave. However, Six ends up separated from the others, landing at a military base in New Mexico. From there, the military finds her and drugs her. She discovers that the government is working with the Mogadorians. A quick battle between Six and Setrakus Ra, the leader of the Mogs, leaves Six in a rock cocoon. Nine and Four arrive at the penthouse and attempt to contact the other Garde, where they meet up with Number Eight and Setrakus Ra in a dream. Four proclaims to be Pittacus Lore, angering Nine. Nine insists on returning to Paradise, but eventually the two decide to rush to the aid of the other Garde in New Mexico, after learning of Setrakus Ra's location. Seven, Eight, and Ella teleport to New Mexico in the middle of a battle between the Mogs, the military, and Four and Nine. Upon entering the base, they find Sarah and rush to aid Six in battle. Setrakus Ra takes the form of Six, tricking the Garde and stabbing Eight. A battle ensues while Seven heals Eight, making the Garde believe a Loric prophecy foretelling of Eight's death has been broken. Four develops a healing legacy in battle, allowing him to heal a burned Sarah and Ella after being shot by a Mogadorian blaster. Ella develops a new Legacy that gives her the ability to block the Legacies of other Garde. Setrakus Ra, who has the same Legacy, uses his to block the powers of the other Garde. Ella, in turn, uses her Legacy to block his; as a result, the other Garde regain their Legacies. Setrakus Ra, powerless, retreats, giving the Garde time to retrieve Six and flee to Chicago, after the collapse of Dulce Base in New Mexico. The Fall of Five The Fall of Five, the 4th book of The Lorien Legacies, was released on August 27, 2013. This book is also told in the first person perspective, between Sam Goode, John Smith (Four), and Marina (Seven). The novel opens with Sam's imprisonment in New Mexico by the Mogadorians. Sam is being held incommunicado except for Mogadorian guards and fed a daily diet of stale cheese sandwiches and dirty water. Through a flashback, we learn that Sam was transported to New Mexico by human co-conspirators of the Mogadorians shortly after the battle in West Virginia. Before he was moved, he was tortured by the Mogadorian leader Setr√°kus Ra while suspended via chains from the ceiling. An acidic black goo crawls down the chains and burns Sam's wrists, a pain only relieved by being touched by Setr√°kus Ra's oddly shaped golden cane. Sam, unfortunately, does not know much, as he was the only one who had Six's plan post-West Virginia in a letter that was seized by the Mogs. After the flashback, the base is attacked by the Garde, as related at the end of the third book. However, it is not the Garde that discover Sam, but surprisingly his long-missing father. In a further twist, we discover that Malcolm Goode is accompanied by Adam, a good Mog teenager with Legacies. Adam is able to cause localized earthquakes, an effect he uses to break the back of Sam's cell, allowing Malcolm and Sam to escape. Apparently, Malcolm and Adam, having learned where Sam was being kept, decided to attack at the same time as the Garde. Adam stays behind to cover their exit. Sam and Malcolm sneak out during the chaos unnoticed by both the Mogs and the Garde. John (Four) begins to narrate and takes up the story, while the remaining Garde (Six, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten) plus Bernie Kosar (BK) and Sarah are all safely at Nine's penthouse apartment in Chicago. Initially aimless while healing, John is struggling to determine what next step to take. Ten (Ella) has been having nightmares, similar to the nightmares shared by John and Nine prior to going to New Mexico. John discusses the dreams with Ella. During the conversation, John recalls how Ella hurt Setr√°kus Ra by throwing a glowing piece of metal at him and speculates that it might be a new Legacy developing for her. He attempts to get her to practice, but she resists, declaring it \\"wrong.\\" She relates the dream of the fight with Setr√°kus Ra, except in this version he realizes who Ella is and kneels before her, asking if she has read the letter. She tells John she knows of no letter and the conversation ends. After a short detour for Sarah and Six to have target practice, it is then discovered that the Loric symbol for \\"five\\" has been burned into crops in Florida. Five next leaves a message on the Internet, in spite of the fact that the Mogadorians regularly monitor it. After much discussion and fearful for the safety of the missing member of the Garde, John, Six, Sarah and BK leave for Arkansas to meet with Five before the Mogadorians arrive. Marina (Seven) takes over narration duties after the away team departs. After nudging Ella to read the letter her C√™pan left her, she leaves the penthouse with Eight to go sightseeing. Scolded by Nine on their return, they agree to train with him and thereby sharpen their skills. At the culmination of this fight, Ella returns having read the letter from her C√™pan. It reveals that unlike the other Loric, she is not to become one of the Elders. Instead, her father comes from the family that once held the position of the tenth elder, but had since had it taken away. Her escape from Lorien was a fluke, a byproduct of her father's fascination with artifacts. He loaded her, her C√™pan and his menagerie of Chim√¶ra onto an old, fuel-powered ship and sent it off the planet. He stayed with her mother, who was a Garde, to defend the planet, and fell with it. Ella's initial shock at this revelation makes her feel a fraud, but the other Garde reassure her and she decides to stay. John takes over narration as the away team is driving to retrieve Five. On the way, John and Six resolve their tension over the kiss they shared in book two. After this, they go on to meet Five, who is waiting to meet them. On arrival, they discover Five is ignorant of the danger he created with the crop circle and the Internet message. Five wishes he could meet all of the Garde together and his mind is \\"officially blown\\" when he meets Sarah, their human ally. Just then they are attacked by the Mogadorians, who arrive in a cloaked ship. Five does not participate in the battle, and appears shell-shocked at what he says is his first time to see Mogadorians. Five demonstrates his Legacy, Externa, that allows him to take on the properties of things he touches. Six uses her weather powers to cause the ship to crash, and Sarah, Four and Six mop up the Mogadorians. Just as they think they have won, a new monster‚Äîmuch larger than the piken‚Äîappears, chasing Six. It is a centipede the size of a tanker truck, covered in a cracked and leathery skin with hundreds of tin arms. John remembers creatures like this caged in West Virginia. Five then demonstrates his power of flight, and John climbs on his back above the monster and uses his lumen-powered fireballs to attack the creature. John falls off of Five and lands in front of the creature. Just as he is about to be eaten, a red dot appears on the creatures massive single eye and then a rifle shot blows that orb apart in a grisly fashion. John kills the creature and turns to discover he has been rescued by Malcolm, with Sam in tow. With Sam, Sarah, John and Six reunited, and accompanied by Malcolm and Five, they return to the penthouse to meet up with Marina, Eight, Nine and Ella. Sam takes narration duties just in time to be hugged by Six and overwhelmed by it. Five continues to be both clueless and churlish, culminating in an evening where each of the Garde tells their stories. Five says he lived on the islands with his C√™pan and remained hidden until his C√™pan took ill. Five didn't believe he really was Lorien until he started to develop Legacies. After his Legacies had come in fully, he fulfilled his C√™pan's dying wish and went to the US to join with the other Garde. After this story, Malcolm tells his own, about meeting Pittacus Lore. Struggling to undo the effects of the Mogadorian torture that left holes in his memory, Malcolm reveals that each chest holds a key to contact Lorien again. Malcolm also reveals that there are two kinds of Mogadorians‚Äîthe disposable vat-born, and the more rare trueborn that form the ruling class. He also revealed Adam‚Äîa trueborn son of a Mogadorian general‚Äîhad One's memories downloaded into him, which caused him to rebel. Malcolm also revealed Adam's abilities were a \\"gift from the Lorien.\\" They theorize that One gave her legacies to Adam. John declares that they will seek out Adam if he is still alive. Five expresses suspicion about the humans, given how many stories of human collaborators he has heard and their recent contacts with the Mogadorians, but John talks him down. Five continues to be churlish and flips to steel to break Nine's hands in response to Nine's constant bullying. Bernie Kosar goes nuts over an antler artifact from a chest, trying to use it to call the other chimera. A capture the flag game ensues in the newly restored training room where Marina wins the day. John and Sarah go out on a date to the zoo and discover three Mogadorian spies collecting an envelope, filled with notes unhelpfully written in Mogadorian. Malcolm whips up a translator to figure out what was said. Sam attempts to ask Six out but is interrupted by Eight, who claims there is an emergency. The emergency is that Ella's bad dreams have gotten worse. John touches her to try to wake her up and is sucked in, falling into a coma-like state. Urged on in part by Five's story of a healing prism in his lost chest, the rest of the group go off to get the chest to help their friends. While gone, the wheels start to come off the Garde's security. First, the translation software determines the encoded notes were none other than Malcolm's notes on the Garde Legacies. He begins to wonder if the damage to his memory is so bad that he has been turned into a double agent. While Sam has his doubts, Malcolm consents to be willingly locked up. When the long-dead disposable cell phone that connects Malcolm to Adam rings, Sam answers and is warned by Adam that the Mogadorians are coming to raid their safehouse in the penthouse of the John Hancock building. In Florida, Five, Six, Seven, Eight and Nine arrive and acquire a fan boat to go pick up Five's chest. Five flies up to get an aerial view but fails to return with his chest, instead of saying the group should go there together. Just as Five pulls his chest out of the mud, the group is attacked by a three-headed monstrosity initially mistaken for three alligator heads. At one point the narrator sees the letter \\"S\\" carved in the creatures foot, like a signature. While the group struggles with the creature, Five retrieves a glove with a retractable blade and a pan flute from his chest. He plays the flute and the creature subsides. When asked if he can put the creature out of its misery, Five says gladly, saying he made the creature. The \\"S\\" is an upside down 5. Without warning, he strikes Six in the head, holds Nine underwater and keeps Marina back with telekinesis. He then declares to Seven and Eight that \\"they should talk.\\" He then pins Nine against a tree and tries to stab him with his weapon. Eight heroically teleports into the path of Five and is stabbed instead of Nine. Upon Eight's death, Marina develops a new Legacy that allows her to summon and create ice. An icicle appears and she uses her telekinesis to stab out Five's eye, before he flees. Meanwhile, back at the penthouse, Mogadorians land on the roof and rappel into the penthouse. Sam notes it is a relatively small force as if they were not expecting much resistance. They did not expect the comatose Garde to be guarded by their human allies. Bernie Kosar and Malcolm keep them at bay while Sarah and Sam go to get weapons. More Mogadorians come in, and Sam baits them into the training room by declaring that the girl they are looking for‚ÄîElla‚Äîis this way. He then turns on the newly restored training software to \\"insanity\\" and watches as the room deals with the Mogadorians. Sarah and Sam shoot the stunned Mogadorians and then rejoin Bernie Kosar. They hear wave two getting ready to come and attack. Bernie Kosar tries to hold them off, but Sam discovers his dying father and is unwilling to leave him. John wakes up from his unending sleep and heals Sam's father before it is too late. The Revenge of Seven The book is narrated in the first person, with Number Four (John), Number Six, and Ella as narrators. Ella wakes up in a strange place. She sees Mogadorians and tries to escape using the Great Book as a weapon. She realizes that she is in a spaceship. Setr√°kus Ra claims to be her grandfather. He tries to force her to eat and tells her that he used to be an Elder and that he experimented with altering genetics. He also tells her about how Lorien was controlling everything, and he rivaled it. Then, he puts a binding charm over himself and Ella. The Mogadorians try to force Ella to read the Great Book by blasting an alarm at her whenever she doesn't. Ella rips the book apart. Setr√°kus Ra talks to her, mentioning her \\"betrothed\\". Eventually, he arrives. Ella is disgusted to note that she is betrothed to the treacherous Number Five. She finds out that Five killed Eight, and is even more upset. Setr√°kus Ra trains Ella to use her Legacy Dreynen, using Five as the equivalent of a punching bag. She apologizes to him later telepathically. He responds that he deserved it and that they need to escape. Ella wakes up later to find Five talking about how Mogadorians were bad. She and Five decide to escape. She finds out that Five was not aware of their betrothal either. Setr√°kus Ra catches them. Five stabs Setr√°kus Ra and the blow injures Ella. She loses consciousness. Ella wakes up dressed formally for the invasion, with a Mogadorian injection of something disgusting where she was stabbed. Setr√°kus Ra forces her to get up. She sees a message from Phiri Dun-Ra saying that the Garde is at the Sanctuary. Ella accompanies Setr√°kus Ra to greet the humans. She sees Number Nine and tells him telepathically to break Ra's staff. She witnesses Ra talking about how the faithful humans will greet him, and then a human leader denying what he said. She realizes that Number Four is there too. John, Sam, Sarah, Malcolm, and Adam, as well as a bunch of Chim√¶rae, are staying in an abandoned textile factory. They figure out that the surviving Garde are in Florida, except for one of them, whose dot on the tablet is bouncing everywhere. But Adam suggests going to Ashwood Estates instead of predictably going to Florida. The others agree, Four with a bit of persuasion required. They find a website titled They Walk Among Us with information about the Mogadorians and Sarah goes to meet Mark James. Malcolm, Four, Sam, and most of the Chim√¶rae go to Ashwood Estates. The Chim√¶rae carry cameras. They survey Mogs carrying equipment and kill them. Adam admits that the General residing at the Estates is his father. Four attacks him, and his shield bracelet is broken. The Chim√¶rae also attack. The General and Four wrestles. Adam stabs his father through the back and takes up his father's old sword. Adam uses Mogadorian surveillance to help Seven, Six, and Nine break into the base. Adam hacks a ship and uses its guns to kill all of the Mogadorians. Number Six, Number Seven, and Number Nine are trying to escape the swamp. They find a form of town and see that the Chicago penthouse was destroyed. Marina finds a man who claims that there is an old NASA base in the swamp with UFOs flying around it. She believes that Eight's body is there and decides to have the man lead them there. Nine and Six agree. Marina tells Six that she can feel Eight somewhere. They see Mogadorians from their boat and kill them. The man who was leading them is frightened and flees the boat. Nine, Seven, and Six find a huge Mogadorian base. They turn invisible and enter it. Nine uses his animal telepathy to tell a beast controlled by the Mogadorians to cause a distraction. It obliges but is killed, but it has given them enough time to make it into a greenhouse. They find Number Five lurking, as well as Number Eight's body. Five stabs a Mogadorian telling him to bring Eight's body to a ship. Six, Seven, and Nine are left with Eight's body. Five apologizes out loud. A huge Mogadorian ship appears in the doorway and kills all of the Mogadorians. They hear Number Four's voice coming out of the ship and board it. Six \\"pilots\\" it to Ashwood Estates, with Adam's instruction. Six and Sam kiss. Shortly after Seven, Six, and Nine come to Ashwood Estates, Agent Walker and some FBI agents arrive. They have realized that the Mogadorians are villainous and want to help the Garde. They have seen what happens when someone stops taking the Mogadorian augmentations and they tell the Garde about the Mogadorians plan - to assassinate the secretary of defense, Bud Sanderson, who was working for the Mogadorians. They believe that his assassination will help stop Setr√°kus Ra's invasion plan. The next day, Malcolm gathers footage of his mind being dredged. He shows them what he said, that Lorien is not a planet, but an entity, and that it can be awoken in Earth when their Inheritances are put in Calakmul. Four, Sam, and Nine decide to proceed with Walker's plan and go to New York. Marina, Six, and Adam decide to go to Calakmul. They collect much of the Inheritances to \\"commit to the earth\\" and also bring Henri's ashes and Eight's body. On the plane, Marina is hostile toward Adam. When she finds out that he killed his Mogadorian father, she stops. They find a Mogadorian ship trying to contact them. Adam acts authoritative and their ship is allowed entry. When they leave the ship, Phiri Dun-Ra pretends to bargain with him, but hits him on the head. Six and Seven kill the Mogadorians except for Phiri Dun-Ra. Six, Seven, and Adam pass through a force field and climb. They open a door with three pendants and are transported to a place with Loralite everywhere. They see a cylinder in the ground that looks like a well. They dump the contents of the Chests, their pendants, and Henri's ashes down it. Eight's body reanimates. But it isn't him. It's Lorien speaking. It speaks cryptically and annoys Six, but it temporarily resurrects Eight. He kisses Marina one last time before disappearing again. But they find out that the Lorien entity is spreading. Sam, Four, Nine, and Walker are driving. On the way, Nine tries to interrogate Sam about Six. Four stops him. Nine claps, wearing a pair of gloves from Marina's Chest, and generates a huge noise. The Mogadorians, of course, find them and attack. The heroes are trying to get bystanders to flee. One bystander takes a video of Four using his healing power. They enter the hotel where Sanderson is staying to find him. He looks awful and has clearly been taking Mogadorian augmentations. He says that it is too late and then shoots himself in the head. Four somehow stops the bullet with telekinesis and heals him. Sanderson tells them that it is too late to prevent the invasion. A spaceship arrives soon after. Sanderson gives Walker names of politicians working for the Mogadorians. They arrive at Setr√°kus Ra's planned invasion site. Nine breaks Setr√°kus Ra's staff, and Ra reverts from his human form to the repulsive genetically modified Mogadorian one. Ra uses Dreynen when Number Four attacks. Ella stabs Setr√°kus Ra in the leg and realizes that she is the only one who can kill him. He would have killed her, but Four prevented it. Five stops Four from stabbing Setr√°kus Ra and killing Ella, and he later stops Nine when he attacks as well. Ella is dragged back onto the ship, half-conscious, her fate unknown. The warship starts to fire. Sam and Four are separated from everyone else except for a group of human survivors being pursued by a piken. It was knocked down with telekinetic force. John realizes he didn't do it, but Sam did. The Fate of Ten The Fate of Ten is the sixth in the series, and was released on 1 September 2015. Its title via facebook page for the series. It was also revealed that there will be seven books in the series, rather than the previously believed six. The cover for the book was released on the 23rd of April 2015, via an interview with MTV. The book is primarily narrated in first person, from the perspectives of Four (John), Six and towards the end of the book, Ten (Ella). A prologue in third person narrates briefly the story of an unnamed human- turned-Garde (later known as Daniela) as she survives a Mogadorian attack on New York. Prologue: An unnamed 15-year-old girl and her 57-year-old stepfather are watching the news of the Mogadorian invasion on TV (the girl is hinted to have a crush on Four) when they hear the Mogadorian soldiers breaking into the apartments on the lower floors of their building. Despite his poor relationship with his stepdaughter, the man sacrifices himself to save her and she flees via the fire escape. Cornered by Mogadorians, she discovers her telekinetic abilities and manages to kill her three attackers. Four (John) narrates chapter 1, which picks up after the end of the previous book, Revenge of Seven. Together with Sam Goode and other survivors, they flee from the Mogadorians, but Four is exhausted from excessive use of his healing legacy. A cop leads the group to safety, but Sam and Four stay behind to continue looking for Nine, who was last seen fighting Five in front of the UN. John realizes that the videos posted online by Sarah and Mark about the Mogadorian invasion have made him into a celebrity, the face of the resistance against the Mogadorians. Sam and Four seek refuge in a deserted apartment where Sam experiments with his telekinesis. They watch the news on TV and are see Nine and Five both battling the Mogadorian soldiers, but they are also fighting each other. Four and Sam leave for Union Square to find them. Six narrates chapter 2, where Six, Seven (Marina) and Adam are leaving the Sanctuary, having recently awoken the Entity, or the spirit which previously dwelled on Lorien and now on Earth. They note that nothing else seems to have changed after the Entity woke. As they try operating a Skimmer (Mogadorian ship) to depart for the US they realize that an evil Mogadorian girl has sabotaged all the Skimmers by removing an important part from each of them. They decide to hunt her down to retrieve the components. Four narrates chapter 3 and 4, where he and Sam are on their way to find Nine and Five. They avoid a Mogadorian patrol which Sam convinces Four not to antagonize. They notice a few Mogadorian soldiers (and a Skimmer) outside a bank, who are disarmed through telekinesis by someone inside the bank. They kill all the Mogadorian soldiers, but not before one radios for reinforcements. They enter the bank to find the girl from the prologue called Daniela, who recognizes Four immediately. Daniela is disinterested in joining forces with them as she only focuses on surviving. They are in the midst of bickering when Setr√°kus Ra's ship, Anubis, comes into view, demolishing buildings left and right. Daniela guides Sam and Four to the subway to hide, and Four notices that the duffel bag Daniela carries is stuffed with cash from the bank. They flee into the tunnels, but the ceiling collapses, and all three work together to hold it up with telekinesis until they are out of danger. Four collapses, and in his dreams he witnesses Mogadorian augmentation surgery performed on Ten (Ella). Six narrates chapter 5 and 6, where Six, Seven and Adam and planning on how to catch Phiri Dun-Ra and retrieve the Skimmer engine parts. They successfully bait her and Marina binds her with ice shackles. Adam tortures her briefly, just enough to find out where the Skimmer parts are hidden. However, the bag is rigged with explosives and blows up in their faces. Adam and Six are badly injured with Adam almost dying but Marina heals both of them in time. Phiri Dun-Ra survives. Adam uses one of the Skimmers to tap into Mogadorian communications where they hear that the Garde's resistance in New York has been apparently crushed. Chapter 7 is a continuation of Four's dream from chapter 4, which is revealed to be telepathically induced by Ten (Ella). Ten takes him on a virtual tour of the Anubis from her memories where they see Setr√°kus Ra throw four Loric pendants into a vat of sludge. Four and Ten talk about Ten's prescient visions of the future. Ten believes that she will have to be killed in order to harm Setr√°kus Ra because of the Mogadorian charm that is causing her to bear injuries inflicted upon Setr√°kus. She tells Four that he is likely to be the one who kills her. As the telepathic vision breaks apart due to the Anubis moving too far out of range, Ten tells Four to warn Six that Setr√°kus Ra is on his way to the Sanctuary and that they should flee. Chapter 8-9: Four wakes up in an abandoned subway car with Daniela and Sam. Only Daniela is awake and she has illuminated the place with the light of cellphones left behind by the passengers when they ditched the train. She tells Four that the duffel bag actually belonged to bank robbers who had robbed the bank she was hiding in, when they fled and she thought the bag would be useful. She and Four talk some more about the whole saving-the-world- from-Mogadorians thing and she describes to him the video posted by Sarah and Mark. Sam wakes and they are about to leave for the civilian evac point at Brooklyn bridge when human soldiers find them in the subway car. They take the three to the Bridge anyway to meet Agent Walker, an ex-MogPro agent from a previous book. Daniela leaves the duffel bag behind in case they arrest her. Four meets with Agent Walker who has been designated as the middleman for the cautious government's communication with the Garde. She tells him of the dire invasion situation all over the world and also tells him about Setr√°kus Ra's threat to the government to surrender all the Garde and humans-turned-Garde to the Mogs in 48 hours. Walker tells Four that the government might actually consider the bargain. Chapter 10 snaps back to Six's perspective in New Mexico where Adam is having trouble scraping together repairs for the Skimmer with his limited materials. Phiri Dun-Ra taunts them and attempts to sow discord but they gag her. Six gets a call from Four who has obtained a satellite phone back in New York. Sam, Four, Six and Seven chat happily with the revelation of Sam's Legacies but Sam urgently warns them of Setr√°kus Ra's incoming ship. Four narrates chapter 11 and 12, where Walker tries to alleviate some of his stress. She shows him Sarah's video, and Sam prompts him to give her a call. They chat for a while with Sarah ultimately encouraging him not to give up fighting when he updates her on the round-the-world Mog invasion. She tells him that she has met GUARD in person and fills him in on the details, but GUARD's information is not revealed to the reader until later in the book. Four feels reinvigorated by his talk with Sarah and leaves the tent to find Sam advising Six not to fight Setr√°kus Ra at the Sanctuary by themselves. Sam asks Four to help but instead Four discusses with Six and Adam on how they can board the Anubis when it arrives at the Sanctuary. After the call ends, Sam argues with Four briefly but Four says Ten's vision depends on it (having misunderstood her warnings for Six and the others to flee instead of fight). Four walks off and Walker shows him footage taken by a civilian of a capsule dropped from the Anubis into the river. Four tells her that Setr√°kus Ra doesn't do anything on accident. Suddenly, human soldiers turn up, one of them heavily injured. They are discovered to have been attacked by Five after mistaking him for an ally. They note that Five has taken an unconscious Nine hostage and that Five will expect Four to meet him at the Statue of Liberty at sunset, lest he give Four a new scar. Everyone expects Five to kill Nine if Four doesn't turn up. Six narrates chapter 13-15, where Six, Seven and Adam are fretting and arguing about the importance of protecting the Sanctuary. It escalates quickly into full-blown quarrelling with insults thrown everywhere, but they manage to resolve the issue and decide to set up traps in order to ambush the Mogs when they arrive at the Sanctuary. At the start of a new chapter, a non-Mog and non-human ship appears, and Sarah and Mark disembark. Six realises that it is the same Loric ship that brought the nine Garde and their Cepans to Earth. After some nostalgia, they meet Lexa, a Loric woman previously known as GUARD. She piloted the antique ship which brought Ten and Crayton to Earth. Mark and Sarah are mildly disappointed that they don't have Legacies. Mark comments on the traps as they finish setting everything up. Six and Seven start to hear Ten's voice in their heads, screaming at them to run or die as the Anubis draws closer, way before schedule. Ten panics but Six and Seven assure her that they have everything under control. The massive Anubis appears and instead of landing, blasts the Sanctuary apart. Six and Mark and badly injured by shrapnel and Seven moves to heal them. Four narrates chapter 16 and 17, where he borrows a human boat and leaves for the Statue of Liberty with Sam, Daniela and a squad of human soldiers. Five is waiting for them and seems badly weakened. He hands over a badly damaged Nine to Four, who heals him almost immediately. Four starts to leave, fed up with Five's theatrics, but Five reveals that he was never going to kill Nine all along, and takes off his shirt with difficulty, revealing that Nine had shoved a steel pole through him while he was still in metal form. Five asks Four to heal him, and turns back to flesh without warning. Four is forced to heal him against Sam's wishes, so Daniela helps him instead. Five is disarmed and Four heals the rest of Nine's injuries. He's about to call Sarah when a military submarine sent to investigate the Mog capsule is hurled out of the water onto land, followed by a massive beast created by Setrakus Ra's use of four Loric pendants. Before they can begin combat, a blue tentacle of light rises from the ground and causes Sam and Daniela to collapse unconscious, with nobody else being able to see it. All of the Garde see the tentacle before they are knocked out, as well as all of the people who gained legacies when the Loric entity was released. When they awake after the collective vision, they start battle against what is dubbed the Mogasaur, and seem unable to do it much damage. Then Daniella finds a new legacy which turns the Mogasaur to stone. The final chapter snaps back to Six and the rest of the crew on the loric ship with Lexa. Marina is out from the beating she took at the hands of Setrakus, Ella sits crying while Six puts pressure on Sarah's wound who is rapidly bleeding out. She phones Johns and tell him she loves him and urges him to carry on fighting before her words fade. Six checks for her pulse already aware that she is gone. United As One United As One is the seventh and final book in the series. The title was revealed on October 26, 2015. It was released on June 28, 2016. The fact that John (Number four) has Ximic may hint at the fact that he is Pittacus' descendant, as Ella is Setr√°kus'. Other clues include physical features, such as blonde hair, and Pittacus' Lumen. United as One is told in first perspective of two characters, Number Four (John Smith) and Number Six. The book opens with brief descriptions of the state of some characters, describing them as \\"a girl\\" or \\"a boy\\" but can be determined who it is told about. It first describes Marina standing on the edge of a cliff in a dream. In The Fate of Ten she was left unconscious after a fight with Setr√°kus Ra. She sees Setr√°kus Ra taking the appearance of Eight, convincing her to let go and be with Eight, but she refuses and chooses to continue to fight. Next a scene is described of Five in a padded cell, locked up by Nine and John. Setr√°kus Ra also comes to him in a dream to convince him to come back on his side. Five refuses. The next scene is Mark walking the football field of his old school in Paradise, clutching a photo of Sarah. He is met by Setr√°kus Ra who tries to tell Mark he can bring Sarah back and they can fight together. The scene ends with Setr√°kus Ra offering his hand to Mark, but does not tell if Mark accepts the offer. John is sitting in his room in a bed and breakfast in Patience Creek. He is called out by Sam and Daniella for the arrival of Ella, Marina, Six, Mark, Adam, and Lexa. The Garde regroup and John has a moment with the deceased Sarah, and Mark James is disgusted at his lack of emotion and blames him for her death. The Garde talk tactics with Lawson, the acting general. John becomes increasingly cold and distant, no longer content with running and playing defense. A plan is hatched to hijack one of the warships and to strip the skimmers of their cloaking devices to co-ordinate a united strike against the other Mogadorian warships. Some new Human-Garde post a video on the internet to attract John's attention to have him pick them up as they stand by a Loralite stone in Niagara Falls. The team splits, with half going to rescue the human garde, while John and Nine meet with Five, who is locked away in a cell. John wants Five to teach him how to fly so he can board the warship. However, he struggles to pick up the legacy, so Five attacks him, hoping the battle rush would help him learn the skill, which he does. However, Marina wakes up and levitates an icicle in front of Five's face, threatening to kill him. The other team, en route to Niagara Falls, encounter turbulence when Sam uses his technopathic legacy to accidentally turn off the ship's engines. With some help from Ella, Sam is able to visualize the workings of the ship and turn them back on. When they arrive on the scene they see fresh signs of a battle, with Skimmers destroyed and fire and ash swirling. The human garde managed to hold their own and fought off the Mogadorians. However, there is some disagreement if the teens are ready for war. To avoid any further people teleporting to Niagara Falls, Ella turns off the Loralite stone. As a neighboring warship makes its way there to check in, the team leaves for base. Adam instigates dissension in the Mogadorian ranks as they start to go against orders and do what they think is best, a warship fires on Sydney while another captain in Moscow declares himself the beloved leader, which leads to the captain in Berlin making an assassination attempt on the usurper. In Kazakhstan another 2 warships meet and began to blow each other apart. Sam attempts to use his techno legacy to copy the cloaking device codes into everyday electronics, he builds a prototype that he asks the team to test when they attack the warship. John, Six, and Adam board the warship. John begins killing all the Mogadorians in a cold ruthless manner, while Adam and Six strip the skimmers of their cloaking devices. Before the day is done the Garde have stolen a warship. They meet a Mogadorian named Rex, whom Adam recognizes and saves from John's attack. Sam's tech is found to be successful. John, not wanting to sacrifice any more friends, takes off to finish Setr√°kus without the others knowing. He realizes he needs a cloaking device and heads back to Patience Creek. However, the base is overrun by Mogadorians, who found the place through a mind controlled Mark James. Some of the true-borns have augmentations, twisted forms of legacies. Phiri dun Ra is there, whose arm has been replaced with black ooze-like tendrils, then she impales John and begins to drain his legacies while he's helpless. While helpless, Mark James slips the Voron noose around John's neck. The damage from this weapon cannot be healed. The others find out about John's suicide mission and argue among themselves over his chosen course of action. Six calls Sam to tell him about his prototype's success when she hears firing in the background. Sam tells Six he thinks they are under attack. Back at the base, John is helpless as he's dragged along the inside of the base, with Phiri mocking his failure at being a hero and his delusional idea of being able to save everyone. To prove a point she kills Mark. Phiri, John and the mind controlling Mogadorians run into resistance. The mind controlling Mogadorian releases a swarm of seemingly black flies that force half the marines to open fire on the others. The human garde make an appearance and are shocked to see John crawling on all fours with a noose around his neck. he screams at them to run but Phiri manages to kill 2 while the other 2 manage to escape. Sam shouts at the lights to turn off and frees Five who immediately attacks Phiri, however the mind controlling Mogadorian manages to overtake Five, but is quickly killed by Sam. Phiri screams for extraction and loses her grip on John as Five slams into her. The shadow Mogadorian makes an appearance and teleports both Phiri and Five. The shadow Mogadorian tries to finish them off, but Sam tells the lights to turn on while he's in a mid teleport, which slices him in half. The others have no time to mourn the dead and set their plan in motion. The garde use the loralite stone to teleport across the world arming the governments with cloaking tech. The Garde aboard their stolen warship make their way to the West Virginia base where Setr√°kus waits. Six summons the biggest storm she has ever created to damage the Anubis, destroying it. Five flies Six and Adam into the base to deactivate the shield, once that's done, Marina, John, Five, and Nine make their way underground to find Setr√°kus. They find a mass grave of Mogadorians and Garde Humans, which repulses them all and steels their drives to end this. Setr√°kus emerges from a pool of black ooze covered in black slime that has given him a youthful appearance and effective immortality. They try to fight against him, however, their legacies are ineffective against him. Setr√°kus grabs Five and drowns him in the black puddle. He maims Nine, taking off his arm. While trying to heal him, Marina attacks Setr√°kus with her healing legacy, to which he recoils in pain. John, picking up on this, continues the healing assault and urges Marina to run with Nine, who is no shape to fight, she protests but John insists. Nine transfers his strength and anti gravity legacy to her and she slings him over her shoulder and runs. John is locked in battle with Setr√°kus with both of them taking heavy damage, while John pours his healing legacy into him, while also using it on himself in small bursts to keep him going. He establishes telepathic contact with Sam and tells him to blow up the mountain. While this is going on Adam and Six run into Phiri, who wounds Six and attacks Adam, Dust attacks Phiri but is quickly overwhelmed. Six manages to telekinetically pin Phiri to the wall, but a Mogadoraian sneaks behind her and shoots her, Adam promptly kills the Mogadorian but Phiri impales him and begins to drain his Loric spark, she releases a seismic wave that knocks Six back. Adam plunges his hands into the black oily tentacles and begins to tear itself away from Phiri's stump and bond with Adam. He uses his seismic legacy and collapses the floor with both Adam and Phiri falling in. Six attempts to save him but there's nothing there to telekinetically grab. Six realizes Dust has disappeared. Ella urges Six to make her way to the main entrance where Marina and Nine are on their way. Marina tries to get Six out of the base, but she refuses, asking Marina to heal her so she can finish the battle. Six makes her way to the central chamber where John lays beaten and broken. She sees a frail withered old man crawling across the cavern floor she picks up the Voron dagger and decapitates him. She makes her way over to John who she thinks is dead but a gasp from John proves otherwise. His eyes swollen shut he grasps six's arm and whispers 'Sarah?', Six gives him a quick kiss before he falls unconscious. Six grabs John and they climb on to Bernie Kosar's back and fly up. John remembers snippets after that such as seeing Adam crying as he clutched the final form of dust who was frozen in a wolf/snake form. John decides to close his eyes not wanting to see any more sadness. One year later John is in the Himalayas restoring the cave that Eight had found. He scrubs the prophecies from the wall and Ella tells him it's time. John is hesitant as he secluded himself on the mountain after the fight until Ella found him and kept him company for some months. While clutching a small box, he flies to the Garde academy that's still under construction in San Francisco. Invisible, he follows the sound to where kids are practicing their telekinesis; Nine stands on the catwalk and when they miss a ball he makes them run laps. His arm is still missing and he's grown his hair. John flies to him and turns visible, and he is greeted by a hug while being chastised for not staying in contact. John apologizes and gives Nine something from his box. Lexa is also at the academy hacking into the dark web protecting the human garde from potential threats. He then goes to New York where repairs and construction is still under way. He observes Daniela from afar who uses her stone legacy to repair building foundations before embracing her mother. John sees Agent Walker in a Montreal car park where she kills someone. John reveals himself to her and she is pleased to see him, he says to her you better have a good reason for that, in response she shows what was in the man's briefcase, 3 vials of black ooze which surprises John. Walker takes out a vial from her pocket and pours it into the black ooze, destroying the substance. Walker says she could use some help tracking this down and John hands her a blue loralite pendant from his box and says they will talk about it soon. He finds Adam in Alaska with Rex in a prison camp with other Mogs who surrendered, John says he can break them out and he replies saying this is the best place for him to rehabilitate his people. It's mentioned he got a full pardon but didn't use it. John gives him a pendant. He goes to paradise and hugs Malcolm which brings back memories of Henri. He ruminates on tracking Mark James' father to tell him what really happened. Finally he steps on Sarah's doorstep still unable to tell her parents what happened. He tracks Six and Sam who are on their vacation. He observes them in the ocean in an embrace and leaves 2 pendants with a note. Lastly he looks for Marina who John says would have taken ages to track if it weren't for her sporadic calls to Ella. Ella says she's not the same and has become paranoid and angry. He finds her in a speedboat navigating islands in the south pacific. John recognizes the signs of isolation from his own experiences. When he appears she isn't startled and asks if he's really there or has gone crazy. He replies that it's really him and she smiles. She says that he's come at a good time and shows him a video footage of the West Virginia base where an object that looked like a missile shoots up into the sky. Marina says she found Five last week on one of the small deserted islands. His body is very skinny with lumps of skin hanging off with dark patches of obsidian blotching his skin. Marina confides in John that she has tried to get over the war and all the death and destruction but she just can't. She tells John that he said her she could decide what to do with Five but she doesn't want to carry it around with her. John suggests her to get out of here and Marina asks what to do with Five to which John says that he's a ghost we aren't. Marina returns with John to the Himalayas. She finally cries when she sees what he's done with the cave. She reaches out to John before thanking him and she kisses him. He's not sure what it means ruminating maybe nothing, maybe something. He shows Marina what he's been working for the past year: a massive wooden table with a loralite stone in the middle reminiscent of the table in the Elder's chamber with the Loric symbol of unity burned into the table and the pendants. John plans to use this as a meeting place for friends and allies where they will gather to solve problems, with a space at the table for Loric/Garde/humans/allies. The only exception is that there are not nine seats around the table as he's done with numbers. The Lost Files series The Legacies The Legacies, was released on July 24, 2012.
