In many other parts of the world the term ‚Äòphonograph‚Äô is used for both. is an English society and registered charity dedicated to the research in all aspects of early recorded sound. Founded in 1919, the CLPGS is most likely the oldest society of its type in the world. History The CLPGS was founded under the name \\"The Edison Society\\" in 1919, when Norman Hillyer and some members of the North London Phonograph and Gramophone Society decided that a group was needed within the City of London. The founding members agreed to approach Thomas Edison to ask if he would become a Patron of the new venture. Edison would only agree if the group changed its name to the City of London Phonograph Society, so this was done. The group's initial membership numbered about forty. In the 1920s, with the shift away from phonograph cylinders, the group changed its name to \\"The City of London Phonograph and Radio Society\\", reflecting many of the members' interests in early radio technology. Meetings of the society have continued since these early beginnings, interrupted by World War II, but resumed afterward. The society has met at various locations in the City of London throughout its history, with meetings presently held at Conway Hall. By the mid 1960s, the interest in radios as a hobby had waned, and the group renamed themselves with their present name to reflect their interest in early recorded sound technology. One of the Society's patrons is Oliver Berliner, grandson of the recording pioneer Emile Berliner. It is now the oldest such society in the world. Publications Since 1963, the society has published its magazine, initially named The Hillandale News and now called For the Record. These publications have been a significant vehicle for research on early recordings.The CLPGS Reference Series books are also published quarterly, designed to provide an accessible library of historic information in both text and audio form. The Masters Series, which reproduces phonograph cylinders of operatic interest, was launched in 2013. Since its inception, the CLPGS has documented and published works dedicated to the origins of audio recording, 65 works in 67 publications in 2 languages and 262 library holdings.

Fiapre is very close to the regional capital town of the Bono Region, Sunyani. Early history History has it that the people of Fiapre migrated first from Jukwaa in Denkyira land after the famous Feyiase war during which the Ashantis led by Nana Osei Tutu defeated the Denkyira army led by Nana Ntim Gyakari. In fact they sought refuge at Bantama in Kumasi. During the period, many people took refuge at Bantama, which became a safe haven during Ashanti's war of expansion. Bantama became over-populated and the people of Fiapre, led by their leader Nana Kyem Amponsah and Obaa Panin Yaa Pomaah, sought permission from their host to move further north. They were granted permission and went to stay temporarily at Techiman Baamire. They took along their black stool. The chief and elders of Techiman Baamire did not want to share their land with Nana Kyem Amponsah and Obaa Panin Yaa Pomaah so they sacked them virtually. From Techiman Baamire, the people moved to Chiraa near Sunyani where they were received well by the people. Close by, Nana Antepim had established a village called Odomase. He was both a farmer and a hunter. Nana Antepim visited Chiraa one day and saw the beautiful Obaa Panin Yaa Pomaah and fell in love with her. He was able to convince the people to move to Odomase. At Odomase, the new immigrants and their hosts co-existed peacefully because it was established that most of the people of Odomase also migrated from Denkyira. However, Nana Antepim wanted Nana Kyem Amponsah to have his freedom to reign over his people taking into account the black stool so he showed him a piece of land on the west. This is the area on and around the hill facing the current Brong Ahafo Regional Minister's Residence on the right-hand of the Berekum-Sunyani main road beyond the SDA Hospital. When they settled over there, they found the land especially on the hill as being rocky and could not support erection of huts for accommodation. So they called the place \\"Asi-apiri\\" literally meaning that whenever one dug, the tool \\"hit a rock\\". The place is still called Asi- apiri. They therefore decided to move a little way to the north and settled at a place called Tweneboase named after a type of tree called Tweneboa. They felt better at the place but had a problem with access to potable water. Meanwhile, there was still a very cordial relationship between the people of the new settlement and the people of Odomase. When they moved from Asi-apiri, they reported to their counterparts at Odomase, \\"We have moved from Apiri\\", which in Twi was stated as \\"Y'afiri apiri.\\" With repetition, the new settlement became known as Firi-apiri, which name has been corrupted to Fiapre. However, one Attah found a stream, towards the east and a little closer to Odumase, which was very accessible. The people called the stream Atta-dea, meaning \\"It belongs to Attah\\". The stream is still very active but the name has been corrupted to Ata-der. The stream attracted the people to move towards it. They built their huts close by and found the land very fertile. The royal family of Fiapre is known as \\"Brofrease\\", because tradition has it that when they reported on the state of their newly found land, they said it was as soft \\"as under a pawpaw tree\\". Paw-paw is the English word for brofre in the Twi Language. Education Fiapre has one of the best female secondary schools in the region known as, Notre Damme Senior High School. It has two private tertiary institutions, these are the Catholic University College of Ghana and Ideas University College. In addition, the University of Energy and Natural Resources is located at Fiapre.Schools in Ghana . ghanaschoolsonline.com. Economy Agriculture is the main occupation for the people in the town, while teaching, civil service and private businesses also play a very big role. Three financial institutions namely; GN Bank, Capital Rural Bank and Drobo Community Bank Limited have their branches at Fiapre.

It is situated near the Western Ghats and within 100 km of the popular hill station, Ooty. Nilambur pattulsavam is a tourism festival organised by the Nilambur municipality and trade organisations . Earlier kovilakam, the royal family conducted the festival. Nilambur Pattu and Kovilakam are the two things associated with Nilambur heritage. Every year Vettekaran Pattu is held for two weeks in the first weeks of January. Not much is known about the history behind the Nilambur Pattu, but the legends say that every year the tribal people, who used to live in and around the Nilambur forests, come to pay homage to the royal family of the Nilambur Kovilakam. In Kerala history, Nilambur Kovilakam played a vital role in Northern Kerala but, at present, the princely family is just another family. Nilambur Pattulsavam gives the residents the opportunity to cherish old memories of the Nilambur Kovilakam. Now Nilambur Pattu became a festival and celebration time more than cultural event.

The Academy was founded in London on 12 February 1977, by winding up the then successful group ‚ÄòGujrati Sahitya Mandal‚Äô, which was run by Dahyabhai Patel as President and Yogesh Patel as its Secretary, to forge ahead with even greater ambitions, including the project of delivery of Gujarati language and literature courses outside India. Its first President was late Kavi Dahyabhai Patel. Since Vipool Kalyani took the reins as its Secretary General, the Academy moved forward with great vision and activities. Its current president is Vipool Kalyani, who is one of the founding members of the organisation and is a renowned journalist who has been editing 'Opinion', a Gujarati journal. Mrs. Bhadra Vadgama is its Secretary General, who is also a translator of Gujrati literary works and a librarian of repute. The GLA publishes irregularly its journal Ashmita, and some anthologies from time to time. It has also published Gujarati Language text books for its courses and examinations. The GLA examination programme was recognized by the Gujarat State Government, and the decree was signed by the then Gujarat Minister of Education, Mr Karshandas Soneri. The GLA has organized countless events over the years. The speakers have included hundreds of well known literary names in the Gujarati literature, including Umashankar Joshi, Darshak, Niranjan Bhagat, Raghuvir Chowdhury, Yashwant Shukla, Chief minister of Gujarat Late Chimanbhai Patel, and many more.

It was first published in 2002. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 2007. Plot of the novel In 476, the Western Roman Empire is under attack by the barbarian armies under the Heruli General Odoacer. Forces loyal to the empire were destroyed and the Emperor Romulus Augustus, a child at the age of 13, was arrested, deposed, and exiled to the island of Capri. Meanwhile, in Dertona, where stands the castrum of the last legion, the \\"Nova Invicta\\", the battle rages against the Heruli and Skyrian horsemen. The officer Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius, detached from his friends, rides desperately toward the villa of the noble Orestes for help, but the villa was attacked and destroyed by Odoacer's barbarians. Aurelius soon finds Orestes fatally wounded and can only receive the last request of Orestes' dying breath to save and protect Romulus Augustus, his son, the last emperor of Rome. Having reunited with the last survivors of the massacre of his legion (Rufius Vatrenus, a veteran of countless battles, and Cornelius Batiatus, a giant man of enormous strength from Ethiopia) and with the aid of the beautiful Venetian Livia Prisca and former Greek soldiers Orosius and Demetrius, Aurelius takes action and assaults the house of Capri, where Romulus was held prisoner. He is freed along with his tutor Meridius Ambrosinus, and is in possession of a valuable (and much-desired) object: the legendary Calibian sword of Julius Caesar. Pursued by Wufila, Odaocer's ruthless lieutenant, and a small force of barbarian troops, the heterogeneous group will continue to flee north. They soon realize that the Eastern Roman Empire had betrayed them and sided with Odoacer, so they cannot seek refuge in its capital at Constantinople. Precluded any other way, the old Celtic tutor Ambrosinus remembers an old prophecy from his land, and decides to lead the young emperor to Britannia, while the stories of Livia, Aurelius, and their comrades begin to take place in a troubled journey that led the group through the barbarized and devastated territories of Gaul and northern Italy. The group soon arrived in Britain to find that the way of the Roman past, and with it the old and legendary legion of Britain (Legio XII Draco), is not yet entirely disappeared. Still threatened by Wufila, and more by the tyrant Wortigern, who rules over most of the island, hidden by a mask of gold, the group decided to address their enemies in a final battle. Setting a defensive position in the abandoned fort of the Twelfth Legion, Aurelius, Romulus, and their comrades faced Wufila's and Wortigern's mercenaries on the slopes of Mons Badonicus. Before all was lost, the Twelfth Legion appeared on the hilltops, holding high their dragon standard, and drove back the enemy. During the battle, one of Aurelius' faithful friends, Vatrenus was pierced by three spears and nailed to a tree. Batiatus and Livia were mortally wounded. Finally, the ruthless Herulian warrior Wufila was killed by Romulus and Aurelius, who pierced his body both with the Roman officer's sword and the Calibian sword of Julius Caesar. The victory was won for Romulus and Aurelius, though their comrades were either dead or wounded. In his victory, Romulus launched the sword of Caesar into the air, and it stuck to the rock at the center of the lake itself. The inscription on the sword (originally \\"Cai.Iul.Caes. Ensis Caliburnus\\", meaning \\"The Chalybic Sword of Caius Julius Caesar\\") with the passing of time will be partially erased, showing only the letters \\"E-S-CALIBUR\\". In the years that followed, Aurelius, accompanied by Livia Prisca and Cornelius Batiatus, returned to Italy to establish a new life. Romulus was called Pendragon by the Romans, and he became king of Britain. He married Ygraine, the daughter of Kustennin, the commander of the Twelfth Legion, and they had a son.

The movie stars Marcella Zailanty, Nadia Saphira, and Ayu Laksmi as the three women in their respective stories in the movie. Similar to Opera Jawa, Under the Tree was universally praised by reviewers from both Indonesian and foreign countries' critics, with praise mostly directed to Nugroho's artistic view on the subject and the cast's performance. After released in several foreign countries, Under the Tree was released in Indonesia and was acclaimed, ended up receiving seven Citra Award nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director for Nugroho, and Best Actress for Laksmi, winning two awards; Best Supporting Actress for Aryani Kriegenburg Williems and Best Art Direction. Plot The film follows three women on their individual journeys in Bali. The first, Maharani (Marcella Zalianty), is an adoptee from Jakarta who has come to Bali to look for her birth mother. The second, Nian (Nadia Saphira), is a celebrity who goes to Bali to escape her family life back in Jakarta. The last, Dewi (Ayu Laksmi), is a radio personality whose husband is never home and who is carrying a dead child in her womb; Dewi must eventually choose whether to live or to commit suicide. Production Nugroho and his production team spent 20 days filming on Bali, including in Ubud, Sanur, and Karangasem. The film was produced without a screenplay. Instead, the actors were asked to discuss their ideas for their characters with Nugroho, to ensure that they understood their own character. Themes Nugroho notes that Under the Tree is a critique of suicide in Indonesia, and how very few people pay attention to it, including the government. He notes that \\"trees are attached to human lives\\". Nugroho has also stated that the movie has an environmental message. Release and reception Under the Tree had its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. It later competed in the Tokyo Film Festival. Nauval Yazid of The Jakarta Post notes that Under the Tree is somewhat mainstream for Nugroho, who generally makes art films. The film's choreography during the Balinese dancing is praised, as is storyline and Laksmi's performance. However, the other two main characters are described as not resonating as much as Laskmi, and the use of the shaky camera technique is criticized. In its review of the film for the Toronto International Film Festival, Variety notes that Under the Tree mixes traditional Balinese music with modern issues, similar to the Javanese music used in Nugroho's previous film Opera Jawa; the execution is noted to be not \\"as well integrated\\" as in the older film. The brown-tinted and shaky camerawork was considered \\"sometimes near-nauseating.\\" References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography   Category:2008 films Category:Indonesian films Category:Indonesian-language films Category:Films shot in Indonesia Category:Films directed by Garin Nugroho ","title":"Under the Tree (2008 film)"},{"id":"33260597","text":"Sveti Pavel is a novel by Slovenian author Pavle Zidar.

During this time period, early 1990s, this action had been talked and argued about among individuals. The name was first used by the media in The Independent newspaper, after Essex Police used riot control measures against demonstrators. By 1995, members of the public had become increasingly concerned about the conditions in which animals were reared, transported and slaughtered. Some examples of the animals that were being exported were cattle, veal calves, and sheep. Exporters had been forced to use small ports such as Brightlingsea to transport livestock after the country's three main ferry operators introduced bans on live cargo. This followed mounting public pressure about the suffering of sheep and cattle packed into huge transport vehicles for excessive periods. There were 2 organizations that were trying to help this cause. The first one was Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty and the second was Compassion in World Farming. They used different tactics to stop this issue, which eventually ended up working. In result however, the transportation of the cattle was sent through Brightingsea. The two largest campaign groups, Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) and the RSPCA, had called for a ban on all live exports by limiting journeys to eight hours. European regulations allowed for journeys of up to 24 hours without food or water. The demonstrations, which were composed largely of local residents, ended on 30 October, when exporters announced they would no longer transport animals through the town because of the extra cost and chaos caused by the daily protests. In practice, the export of live animals continued from other ports, halting only in February 1996 when the European Union banned live exports from Britain over fears of \\"mad cow disease\\" entering the European food chain. The ban was lifted in 2006. Background =Cross-Channel trade= In 1988 there were approximately 1,000 abattoirs in Britain. By 1992 this number had fallen to 700 of which half were at risk of closure because of changes to European Commission (EC) regulations. Prior to this date most livestock in the country were only a few hours by road from the abattoir. The closures lengthened the road journeys required and, under EC rather than UK regulations, transport times of up to 24 hours without rest, food or water were permissible. Investigations found that even this extended period was \\"routinely flouted.\\" British animal welfare groups, such as CIWF and the RSPCA, campaigned against live exports largely because of the suffering of cattle during these long-distance journeys. The RSPCA, which had been campaigning for a complete ban on live exports since 1991, said: \\"All animals should be slaughtered as close as possible to where they are reared.\\" The British Veterinary Association adopted a similar stance, declaring that they were \\"opposed to the export of animals for immediate slaughter and believe that all animals should be slaughtered as near to the point of production as possible.\\" There was also concern about the continuing export of between 300,000 and 400,000 calves each year to Europe, where they were then confined in darkness in veal crates and fed on low-iron, liquid diets designed to produce a commercially valuable pale flesh. Veal crates had been banned in Britain since 1990, but there were no regulations in place to prevent the export of calves to other countries using veal crates or on the subsequent re-import of the meat into Britain. In 1992 250,000 live calves had been exported for veal crating to the Netherlands alone, and 1.4 million live sheep had been exported. Following the introduction of the single European market in 1993, live animals were regarded as \\"'agricultural products' in exactly the same way as a consignment of turnips\\", and any attempt to regulate their journey times or conditions of travel was interpreted as 'a restraint on trade' and, therefore, illegal. =Commercial interests= Commercial interests played a large part in the growth of live exports. Although it cost four times as much to transport a live animal to France than a carcass, British lambs slaughtered in French abattoirs were marked with a French meat inspection stamp instead of the UK abattoir stamp used on British carcass imports. This allowed the meat to be labelled and sold to consumers as \\"French produced\\" at a large premium, outweighing the increased transport costs. A similar practice was carried out in Spain with consignments of live animals exported ostensibly \\"for further fattening.\\" This bypassed a British ban on animals being exported for slaughter in Spanish abattoirs, which had been imposed because of \\"public revulsion at [Spanish] slaughterhouse standards.\\" After a few days of grazing in Spain, the animals were re-classified as Spanish-reared and subsequently slaughtered. Live animals also provided extra profit for slaughterhouses in the form of the so-called \\"fifth quarter\\": the offal, hide, intestine (for sausage skins) and, in sheep, the fleece. =Calls for ban rejected= In April 1994 Nicholas Soames, the minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), announced that despite national campaigns calling for an outright ban on live exports, this could not be imposed as it \\"would be in breach of European Union law.\\" He said that the Government was \\"acutely aware\\" of the great strength of feeling and that the legal department at MAFF had considered a ban under article 36 of the Treaty of Rome, which allowed a restriction on trade on the grounds of public morality or protection of health of humans, animals and plants. The advisers had concluded that article 36 \\"is not available as a basis of action in an area where the Community has established EC legislation.\\" In response to a question in Parliament, Soames told Sir Teddy Taylor: \\"It is not for individual member states to constrain intra-community trade in order to impose higher standards on their own territory\\". Sir Teddy later told the press: \\"What this means is that there is absolutely nothing which the Government and Parliament can do to stop the traffic and that the great national campaigns by the animal charities are pointless... [It is] a massive disappointment which will cause concern to many people in the UK who are concerned about the suffering of animals\\". Withdrawal of ferry services =Sheep deaths in transit= Protests against live export began to be held at British ports and airports. In August 1994 MAFF launched an inquiry after Greek authorities reported that a lorry loaded with 400 sheep from England had arrived in the Greek port of Igoumenitsa on a ferry from Brindisi, Italy on July 8 with 302 of the animals having died in transit. No export licence to Greece had been granted for the livestock, which left for the Netherlands on the Dover to Calais ferry on 5 July. Chief Superintendent Don Balfour, head of the RSPCA special operations unit, said: \\"It is an awful example of what can go wrong on these long journeys with live animals. I question why it is necessary to subject animals to such journeys when there are perfectly adequate slaughterhouses in this country and refrigerated lorries to carry the meat abroad.\\" =Public pressure to ban exports= In August 1994, tabloid newspaper the Daily Star published an article disclosing that British Airways (BA) were transporting live sheep between Perth, Scotland and Singapore. Within twenty four hours of the newspaper being published, Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, banned the carriage of live animals destined for slaughter on BA flights. In the face of increasing public pressure, Brittany Ferries announced that as of 22 August 1994 it would no longer export live animals for slaughter on its six routes to France and Spain. Demonstrators protested at the Dover and Ashford ferry terminals in Kent, and the offices of Stena Sealink ferries were firebombed. As a result, Stena Sealink announced it would no longer transport live animals. Jim Hannah, the company's communications director, said: \\"We have acted essentially for commercial reasons. Over the past few months we have received thousands of letters from our customers saying they do not want to travel on a ferry that carries livestock.\\" P&O; said it would stop carrying animals to mainland Europe for slaughter from October 1994, \\"unless an improvement in European Union standards was imminent.\\" As public feeling against live export grew, even those ferry operators which did not transport livestock felt compelled to distance themselves from the trade. Sally Ferries UK sent out a press release \\"stressing it [had] rejected trade in live freight for more than 13 years\\" although it was actually a local by-law which prohibited them from carrying live exports from their port. =Exporters by-pass ferry bans= An Antonov AN-12 military cargo aircraft. This type of aircraft was used to transport up to 240 calves at a time from the UK to Europe. By 1 October 1994, when the ferry operators' ban began to affect the export trade, MAFF had received five applications from smaller operators to take over the trade. The new operators planned to carry only animals and freight \\"and would therefore be less exposed to public disapproval.\\" MT Shipping planned to sail from Harwich, Essex to Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, an eight-hour journey much longer than the traditional one from Dover to Calais. The company said it would take between 50 and 110 lorries on its ferry, while P&O; and Stena Sealink normally carried no more than twelve livestock lorries on their ships, mainly due to ventilation and heat problems. They also asked permission to use former East European military transport planes to fly animals to mainland Europe, a move opposed by campaigners because the aircraft were unpressurised. Balkan Airlines flights from Humberside Airport to Rotterdam in the Netherlands using these aircraft were approved by MAFF on 20 October 1994. These flights were halted at the end of November 1994 due to \\"the strength of public feeling\\". Other flights took place from Belfast Airport, Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Bournemouth Airport and Coventry Airport. On 28 October 1994 a ferry carrying 3,000 lambs sailed from Grimsby to Calais, a journey of about 18 hours, in a \\"trial run\\" intended to open up a new route. The animals were then transported for 10 hours by road to an abattoir in central France. The RSPCA said: \\"We are appalled that these animals have to endure such a long and stressful journey. It is simply not necessary for animals to be transported live for food.\\" In November 1994 Ferrylink Freight Services, owned by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, announced they would transport livestock from Sheerness in Kent to Vlissingen in the Netherlands. Following the first shipment of 3,000 animals, Ferrylink postponed further sailings following bomb threats. On 30 November 1994 a new route was opened from Millbay docks, Plymouth. Approximately 100 police officers were used to escort five lorries loaded with sheep and calves through protesters. On 3‚Äì4 December 1994 Glasgow Prestwick Airport took out advertisements in Scottish newspapers asking the public to write to them to say whether cattle shipments should continue from the airport. On 9 December 1994 the airport announced it would no longer transport live animals. On 21 December 1994 Air Alg√©rie Flight 702P crashed at Coventry on its way to pick up a cargo of 200 calves. All five crew were killed. By January 1995 Dover had also banned livestock cargoes and the only routes still available for live export were Coventry Airport, Plymouth and Shoreham-by-Sea. Shoreham had become the scene of daily violent demonstrations - dubbed the \\"Siege of Shoreham\\" by the media - as protestors attempted to prevent cattle trucks from entering the harbour. Exports through Brightlingsea Oliver's Wharf, Brightlingsea. Named for its owner Ernest Oliver, this privately owned wharf was the loading point for livestock vessels. New Street, Brightlingsea. The compact nature of the route to the wharf through the small town was ideal for protestors. On 11 January 1995 it was revealed that exporters planned to open a new route from Brightlingsea. That an attempt to load livestock at the town's wharf was imminent was widely known by both the authorities and the protesters. Writing in The Guardian on 13 January, David McKie, the newspaper's deputy editor, said: \\"Next week may also be the first time you ask yourself: Where is Brightlingsea? It's been situated almost unnoticed for many centuries eight miles south-east of Colchester. You may need to know because it's one of the minor league ports which may be the scene of confrontations next week as the trade tries to use it for the export of calves, now that Shoreham is so troublesome.\\" The Independent warned: \\"If plans go ahead for the attempted export of calves through its port, residents of [Brightlingsea] (eight miles south-east of Colchester on the B1029, if you're passing that way) had better start barricading their windows now. Protesters, journalists and cameramen will be looking to make it this week's Shoreham-by-Sea.\\" Brightlingsea's layout was ideal for the protesters, and also for the media: unlike other ports, the route that livestock trucks would need to follow through the town to the wharf was very narrow and easily blocked, and also meant that people on the roadside were close enough to the trucks to touch the animals as they passed. Assistant Chief Constable (ACC) Geoffrey Markham of Essex Police described the wharf as \\"the wrong end of a narrow three mile road in a medieval town.\\" =First protest= On 16 January the Danish vessel Caroline was due to sail at midnight from the town with a cargo of 2,000 sheep destined for Nieuwpoort, Belgium. Local residents formed an ad hoc protest group, Brightlingsea Against Live Exports (BALE), and began arriving to demonstrate at approximately 8.30am. By the time the first vehicle arrived at 6.35pm, carrying 400 sheep, around 1,500 people, mostly local, had gathered. Apart from dirt thrown at the truck's windscreen, the demonstration was largely peaceful and consisted of people lying and sitting in the road to block vehicle movement. ACC Markham said: \\"There were young people in the crowd and elderly people. The situation was, in my mind, quite dangerous. On these grounds, I decided that the vehicle should turn around. Having spoken to the organisers of the demonstration, I took the decision that there will be no movement of livestock into Brightlingsea tonight. I will now meet with my colleagues to think about the strategic issue.\\" BALE organiser Francesca d'Silva said: \\"We are glad that the lorry has been turned back but we are not convinced none will come again. We'll be here as long as it takes.\\" Richard Otley complained that the police should have ensured that the vehicles reached the wharf and said: \\"It's ridiculous. That cargo should have been loaded last night.\\" Otley also said that he had complained to his Member of Parliament, John Major, who was also the prime minister, and to Home Secretary Michael Howard. =Storms prevent sailings= Plans to make a second attempt at loading the Caroline were delayed on 17 January when sailings at Brightlingsea were cancelled due to 70 mph winds off the south coast. BALE leafletted every household in the town asking people to attend the protest scheduled for 18 January. They also announced that they would be using boats to intercept the Caroline in the event that the main roadside protest failed. Operation Gunfleet: Change in police tactics Protective riot equipment as worn by police in the UK. The decision to deploy officers in riot gear at Brightlingsea, despite there being no violence at previous demonstrations, was believed by protestors to be an attempt to intimidate the crowd, which included many elderly residents and children. Exporter Roger Mills threatened to sue Essex Police for ¬£30,000 compensation over their failure to escort sheep to the wharf on 16 January. He also warned that he would transport livestock through Brightlingsea on 18 January \\"with or without police support,\\" and ACC Markham responded by ordering the largest public order operation in Essex since the 1950s, codenamed Operation Gunfleet. Just before 8.00am on 18 January trucks carrying 2,000 sheep made their way through the town. Approximately 500 protestors had gathered to attempt to block their route. Essex Police deployed approximately 300 officers, many in riot gear. The first group of protestors who sat in the road were dragged out by police and anybody attempting to take their place was stamped on or punched by officers. By 10.00am the livestock had been loaded on to the Caroline which successfully left the harbour at 1.00pm despite the efforts of protesters in inflatable boats. Exporter Richard Otley said: \\"It was marvellous. The police mounted a super operation.\\" Essex Police received more than 200 complaints about \\"excessive riot-style violence\\" carried out by officers. Protestor Antona Mead, the wife of a local magistrate, said that the demonstrators were sitting peacefully in the road when police in riot gear and wielding long- handled batons \\"just steamed in and jackbooted their way through the crowd. We were treated like the worst kind of football hooligans.\\" One elderly protestor, 61-year-old Fred Griffin, said: \\"There are no militants here. [The police] just punched their way through perfectly well-behaved demonstrators like Robocops.\\" Rick Morgan, the mayor of Brightlingsea, said: > I saw nothing but a peaceful protest. The reaction by the police was just > over the top. The town is united against this live animal trade and these > were local people attempting to make a peaceful protest. They included > pensioners, children and mothers with babies. Writing in The Guardian newspaper, protestor Bill Campbell expressed his shock at the \\"overwhelming nature and the provocative style of the police action\\" given that the previous demonstration had been non-violent and ACC Markham had described the protestors \\"in approving terms regarding their mood and behaviour.\\" Campbell described the police tactics as \\"a new but revealing experience\\" and said: > A good natured crowd had gathered, including both young and old, healthy and > infirm... The first action by the police was to approach this crowd from the > front and the rear with overwhelming numbers wearing riot gear. The crowd > was compressed and trapped. It was a frightening and sinister sight, > provocative in the extreme. We were afforded no opportunity to demonstrate. > As the police closed on us, their mood was threatening and violent. While > some individual police, as the situation developed, behaved with care and > courtesy, many appeared to be excessively aggressive. Overall, the situation got violent towards the end of the campaign. There were fights that broke out between the people of the protest and the police. Items such as beer bottles and stones were used during these fights, which is one example why the protest turned violent. =Use of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act= On 10 April 1995 ACC Markham sent a letter to every household in Brightlingsea warning that from 18 April 1995 protestors risked arrest and imprisonment under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. In the letter, Markham wrote: \\"A belief has grown among demonstrators who feel it lawful to routinely walk in front of vehicles on the highway. It is my intention to use the provisions of the Public Order Act to restrain unlawful activity.\\" The letter advised that after 18 April no demonstrations would be permitted at the docks and that demonstrations in other parts of the town would be restricted to one per month and only if authorised in advance by the police. All persons planning to attend a demonstration were required to fill out an application form 6 days in advance for each attendance. Civil rights group Liberty said the letter was unprecedented. As the legislation allowed the organisers of demonstrations to be prosecuted in the event of public disorder, BALE formally disbanded. On 17 April 1995 Maria Wilby told the media: \\"As of tonight BALE will not exist although the protest will go on. People are very frightened but are prepared to be arrested.\\" John Wadham, Liberty's legal director, said: \\"The police tactics are incredibly naive. The only opportunity for ensuring a procession continues to be peaceful is if the police can talk to the organisers. If there are no organisers, it is more likely to be chaotic and confrontational.\\" Mayor Morgan told the media that the police threat to use public order legislation had angered residents and many more were expected to join the protests as a result. Following a meeting with ACC Markham, Morgan said: > We were given the very strong impression by Mr Markham that this had been > discussed with the other police forces involved with live exports and with > the Home Office. It appears that there is strong backing for Essex Police to > use the Public Order Act as a test for Dover. If they can win here, they can > win at Dover. The police are playing for very high stakes. On 20 April 1995 Essex Police deployed 300 officers to Brightlingsea to permit the passage of 4 livestock trucks. Around 500 protestors sat in the road to block the convoy, ignoring police warnings that \\"their actions constituted an illegal gathering.\\" The proposed use of public order legislation had also led to the protestors being joined by activists from the Socialist Workers Party. When police officers moved in to begin arresting protestors, violence broke out and the police were pelted with bottles, cans, coins, eggs and paint. A number of officers were injured and taken for treatment at Colchester General Hospital. Former BALE organiser Carol Appleby said that the disbanding of the co-ordinating group due to police threats of legal action had \\"removed the opportunity to control renegade elements.\\" ;Restrictive bail conditions The media were critical of the use of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act by police to set bail conditions \\"without reference to a court\\", and to remove \\"the presumption of bail for those facing a second charge.\\" This allowed the police to arrest protesters on minor charges and then \\"severely curtail\\" their activities and movements on bail conditions enforced by the threat of jail. Protestors at Brightlingsea found themselves being bailed on the condition that they did not attend any live export protests or related meetings. Suspension of live exports By September 1995, the only UK ports still carrying out live exports were Brightlingsea and Dover. The protests at Brightlingsea continued daily, attracting up to 1,000 protestors. On 30 October 1995 Roger Mills announced that he would cease exporting through Brightlingsea and instead use Dover \\"for a few weeks\\" while discussing the matter with the police. After all of these events took place, exporters did not go through Brightlingsea anymore due to the extreme events of the people. With the total cost of 10-month police operation having reached ¬£2.25 million, Mills had been restricted to only one shipment per day, high tide permitting, and none at the weekends. Campaigners called the suspension a \\"major triumph.\\" Aftermath =Luckhurst Report= The \\"militant middle class\\" One of the most striking features of the demonstrations at Brightlingsea was the demographic of the protestors themselves. The majority were local people, \\"many of whom had never protested about anything in their lives before.\\" Survey results showed that: * 82% of the protestors were women * 81% had never protested before * 73% were aged between 41-70 * 71% were local residents * 38% were retired Both the media and the authorities were \\"taken by surprise by the intensity of support\\" given to the protest and the presence of so many pensioners and mothers with young children \\"challenged the...stereotype of the typical animal rights protestor.\\" The media had \\"expected such events to be dominated by the usual suspects, Earth First campaigners, Greenpeace and animal rights groups\\" but instead found middle class, adult protesters alongside and outnumbering \\"the radical young.\\" Caroline Davies, writing in The Daily Telegraph, characterised the protestors as \\"middle class, moral and mad as hell\\", while Madeleine Bunting for The Guardian identified the typical protestor as a \\"middle class, home counties, middle-aged concerned [housewife].\\" Legal actions A number of legal actions arose from the protests. =Injunctions= On 29 August 1995 Roger Mills applied to the High Court of Justice for an immediate injunction banning 12 named protestors - 9 women and 3 men - from obstructing his trucks entering the port. Although injunctions had previously been sought to prevent trade unions carrying out mass protests, this was believed to be the first time that injunctions against named members of the public had been applied for. Mr Justice Morrison turned down the application and adjourned the case for a full hearing. On 22 September 1995 the application was heard in the High Court by Mr Justice Forbes. As well as seeking the injunction banning the named protestors, Mills also applied for costs and damages of ¬£500,000 to be awarded against the defendants. Mills claimed that \\"the sheer number of arrests, 583 to date, plus the existence of BALE... and fliers distributed on its behalf amounted to a conspiracy\\" and that \\"the defendants were involved in breaking the law and were inciting others to do the same.\\" Mr Justice Forbes responded that there were \\"occasions where unlawful activities gained the admiration of law-abiding citizens\\" and said: \\"What Mahatma Gandhi did was certainly against the law... but most people approved of what he did.\\" The injunction was not granted. =Prosecution of Tilly Merritt= In January 1996 Tilly Merritt, a 79-year- old woman from Brightlingsea, was convicted of assaulting Police Constable Kevin Conermey after spraying him with water from a garden hose during the protests in February 1995. She was sentenced to 2 days imprisonment when she told magistrates at Colchester that she refused to pay the ¬£302 fine. Well- wishers paid the fine while she was waiting for the prison van to take her to HM Prison Holloway, and she was released. =Prosecution of Roger Mills= On 1 March 1996, at Harwich magistrates court, Roger Mills was convicted of dangerous driving. The offence took place during the protests in 1995 when Mills deliberately drove his vehicle into a group of demonstrators. He was fined ¬£1000 and banned from driving for 12 months.

A project of businessman and former basketball player Jackie Robinson, the complex will encompass a resort hotel, retail and restaurant space, and a multi-purpose indoor arena with a retractable roof. Its location is set on the Las Vegas Strip at the former site of a Wet 'n Wild waterpark, next to the Sahara Las Vegas in Winchester, Nevada. Designed by the Cuningham Group, it was initially planned to open in 2017. Robinson announced in August 2019 that he was in the final stages of getting his loan for the project, which was expected to cost nearly $3 billion. History =Silver State Arena= The idea of turning the abandoned site of a Wet 'n Wild waterpark on Las Vegas Boulevard into a stadium begun in 2010, as Texas-based developer Chris Milam revealed plans for a \\"Silver State Arena\\" following the cancellation of Crown Las Vegas. It was set to break ground in September 2010 and open in 2012. Milam's company International Development Management would get the land from Sue Lowden and her husband Paul, and atop build a 20,000-seat stadium at the cost of $750 million, using about $9 million a year in redevelopment district taxes. The project stalled after Clark County rejected a proposal to fund 15% of the venue with public money and nearby residents opposed construction. By the following year, the site was changed to nearby the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where Milam would create a whole sports complex that included new ballpark for the Las Vegas 51s. The plans came to nothing and Milam \\"walked away\\" from the baseball deal. The site near Mandalay Bay is now Allegiant Stadium. There was later another plan where the Silver State Arena would be near the M Resort in Henderson, financed by Chinese bank partners, but these plans also went nowhere. =All Net Resort and Arena= In December 2013, businessman Jackie Robinson, a former UNLV student and NBA player, announced that he was planning on using the same site of the proposed Silver State Arena to build his own arena project tentatively known as the All Net Arena and Resort. It would be a $1.4 billion privately funded complex encompassing an arena, hotel and shopping project between the SLS Las Vegas and the Fontainebleau project that could attract an NBA franchise to Las Vegas. The arena itself would cost $690 million, being operated by Comcast-Spectacor (owners of another NBA stadium, Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center). Designed by the Cuningham Group, it was planned to open in 2017, but by April 2016, the project had been delayed until 2018 or 2019. The arena would have a total capacity of 22,800. The All Net Arena saw its ground breaking ceremony on October 29, 2014, and Robinson wanted to negotiate with Clark County expecting to begin construction. However, given the land is not owned by Robinson and the project hit financing problems, the project was still in limbo as of the end of 2015. Demolition of the property begun on 2016, and Robinson hoped to begin construction soon to get the arena finished in 30 to 36 months. In 2017, earth moving equipment and dirt haulers were working the site,Something's happening: It's getting busy at the All-Net Arena site and the All Net group announced it had garnered the full independent financingAll Net Arena construction financed, could start in November and an expansion, adding in larger retail and convention space, and another hotel tower with 2,000 rooms standing at 63 stories tall.All Net Arena revisits plans to expand for basketball arena, hotel The Clark County Commission approved the project on October 18, 2017. Construction was expected to begin before the end of 2017,Commissioners green light new All Net Arena plans and completion was expected by spring 2020. In early June 2019, Robinson said the $2.6 billion project was fully financed and that building designs would take approximately 45 days to receive county approval, while construction would take about three years. In August 2019, Robinson said he was in the final stages of getting his loan for the project, which was expected to cost nearly $3 billion. The project would be financed with money from Qatar, Z√ºrich, and central banks in Europe. Moving the money into the U.S. was a lengthy process. Robinson's group had also invested more than $37 million into the project. All Net is expected to include a 44-story and 63-story hotel, a movie theater, a bowling alley, restaurants, and conference space, among other features.

Biography  Laurencic was born in France as the son of Slovene immigrants from the Austro- Hungarian Empire. Laurencic supported the Republican forces fighting Francisco Franco's Nationalist army in Spain. In 1938, he helped build Civil War jail cells intended to torture Nationalist supporters which resembled 3-D modern art paintings by surrealist Salvador Dal√≠ and Bauhaus artist Wassily Kandinsky. According to Spanish art historian Jose Milicua, who found papers from Laurencic's 1939 trial by a Nationalist military court, Laurencic told the court the cells, in Barcelona, featured sloping beds at a 20-degree angle that were almost impossible to sleep on. They also had irregularly shaped bricks on the floor that prevented prisoners from walking backwards or forwards. The walls in the 2 m x 1 m cells were covered in surrealist patterns designed to make prisoners distressed and confused, and lighting effects were used to make the artwork even more dizzying. Some of them had a stone seat designed to make occupants instantly slide to the floor, while other cells were painted in tar and became stiflingly hot in the summer. Laurencic told the court the cells were built after he heard reports of similar structures being built elsewhere in Spain.Rafael Chac√≥n, Por qu√© hice las checas de Barcelona.

Arising as a branch of the law relating to breach of confidence, it has been reinforced by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, supplemented by s. 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which obliges public institutions (including the courts) not to act inconsistently with Convention rights. Scope Campbell was the watershed moment where the tort of \\"misuse of private information\\" became distinguished in scope from that relating to breach of confidence, as the former does not require \\"an initial confidential relationship.\\"Campbell, par. 14 In addition, actions for misuse of private information can readily attract tortious damages, while those for breach of confidence may receive damages only as an equitable remedy within the discretion of the presiding judge., discussing While it will be obvious what may constitute public (as opposed to private) information in most cases, there will be times where it will need to be assessed as to whether disclosure of information would give substantial offence to an ordinary individual, as noted in Australia by Gleeson CJ in 2001: As originally recognized in Campbell, a cause of action was restricted to disclosures of information or activities in which the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Expansion to include bare intrusions into privacy has been foreshadowed, such as where certain photographs are taken in a public place, however English courts are yet to definitively proscribe intrusions upon seclusion. For example, an injunction against the Wolverhampton Express and Star was obtained in 2005 by an owner of several homes for troubled children to restrain it from disclosing plans for further homes, even though information was publicly available from searches of HM Land Registry records and unredacted minutes of local authority proceedings., discussing In his judgment, Tugendhat J explained why, in this case, rights under Article 8 overrode competing obligations under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights relating to freedom of expression: Other Commonwealth jurisprudence In addition to the Australian case law drawn upon by Campbell, there has been other jurisprudence arising in New Zealand and Canada. While the House of Lords followed the model previously adopted by the High Court of Australia, the other two jurisdictions based their approach on the US Restatement of Torts (Second). It has been noted in Canada that the more principled approach adopted by the English courts post-Campbell may be a better one to follow.

It was published in 1866 in Klagenfurt. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1982.  Summary  The Tenth Brother follows the life of Lovre Kvas, a young scholar, who has to somehow earn enough money to go to university in Vienna, and therefore accepts the position of a home-schooling teacher. He moves to a town called Slemeni≈°ƒçe where he lives with a wealthy family. The family are the master and his wife, their twenty-three-year-old daughter Manica and their nine-year-old son, Balƒçek. They are all very nice and Lovre starts to develop feelings for Manica. His newly made friend, Martinek Spak, who calls himself the tenth brother, supports their relationship. Marijan, a family friend who is also in love with Manica and always thought he would marry her someday, is very unhappy when he sees Lovre and Manica are in love. He gets into a fight with Martinek and ends up shooting him and is hit over the head with the shotgun in return. Martinek dies and Marijan's father, who was also the father of Martinek from a previous marriage, decides to tell Marijan the truth about his past. He then commits suicide. Because Marijan's father left his estate to Lovre, the latter can now return after being banned for his affair with Manica. The two get married and Marijan marries another woman so the story has a happy ending.  Desetnica and deseti brat  There is an old tradition in some Slavic countries (that doesn't exist anymore) where if a couple has ten children of the same gender in a row, the tenth child has to leave. They then travel around the country and are said to possess supernatural abilities such as talking to animals and plants, being able to forecast the future ... If the tenth child is a girl, she is called \\"desetnica\\" (a word, derived from the word \\"ten\\" (deset)). If the child is a boy, he is called \\"deseti brat\\" (the tenth brother). This motif has been illustrated in fiction many times, such as the Desetnica tale and the novel Deseti brat.

In operation since 1939, the system links Rimini with the nearby seaside resort and comune of Riccione. History The line was established on 1 January 1939, with an initial fleet of small Fiat 635F and 656F CGE trolleybuses. Responsibility for the management of the line was entrusted to SITA of Florence until 1959. Classified as line 11, the system passed into the control of ATAM of Rimini by 1960. Under ATAM's management, the Rimini‚ÄìMiramare part of the line was numbered 10, which is now the number used to denote the Miramare‚ÄìFiera line, operated by diesel buses. However, the reversing loop in the overhead wires that allowed trolleybus services to terminate in Miramare was recently dismantled for the construction of a roundabout. At present, the only reversing loop on the system is at the Miramare Talassoterapico roundabout at Piazzale Giardini in Riccione. The Miramare section also previously had unique rotating lights to indicate any malfunction on the line, but this feature has also been dismantled. In the past, all substations serving the line (excluding the new Riccione Abissinia) were equipped with mercury vapor rectifiers, which were housed in buildings with a central chimney to assist with cooling. However, the substations are now all equipped with solid state low thermal output transformers. In 1992, ATAM was renamed TRAM, and in 2001 its name was modified again, to TRAM Servizi. Until 2 November 1998, the Rimini terminus of line 11 was in the central Piazza Tre Martiri. On that date, following the conversion of the piazza into a pedestrian area, the terminus was moved to Piazzale San Girolamo, on Via Dante Alighieri. From 1 August 2001 the Riccione terminus, previously sited in Piazzale Giardini, was moved to the area of Riccione Terme, in Piazzale Marinai d'Italia, while the services limited to piazzale Curiel are shown as \\"11/\\". In 2009, the trolleybus fleet was renewed: on 14 September that year, the Volvo B59 Mauri trolleybuses were taken out of service, as the USTIF had revoked their authorisations. From the following day, the trolleybus lines were temporarily operated by diesel fueled buses and articulated buses pending the completion of work to be performed on the Via Rodi underpass to allow the circulation of new Van Hool AG300T articulated trolleybuses, which entered service from June 2010. Five of these trolleybuses were purchased, with the first unit, delivered in June 2009, carrying out the line tests in the ensuing weeks. Also beginning the same day, due to the inability of the new articulated buses to perform a U-turn in the narrow space of Piazzale San Girolamo, the terminus was moved to the nearby Piazzale Gramsci. However, the overhead wire was not extended, so the new articulated vehicles had to cover the portion of line separating the new terminal from the old one by using their auxiliary diesel engine. On 1 June 2011, the Via Aponia‚ÄìPiazzale Gramsci route was closed; since that date the terminus has been at Via Dante. Line description Especially in summer, the Rimini- Riccione trolleybus line plays an important role, connecting the Rimini town centre, including the Rimini railway station, with the city's southern coast and the city of Riccione. Also known as line 11, it is considered by Mobilit√† di Rimini as a \\"shoreline\\", with an urban section (at normal rate) between Rimini and Miramare and an inter-municipal section (with higher priced tickets) between Rimini and Riccione. The critical point in the whole line is the railway underpass at the Rimini railway station. It has a tight bend and limited clearance, forcing the trolleybuses to flatten their trolley poles near their roofs, with the risk that the trolley poles will come off the wires. In the section from Riccione Terme to Riccione Piazzale Curiel, the overhead wire is of a rigid type cable. From Piazzale Curiel onwards, after the reversing loop, the wire is a floating type, with Swiss-style articulated hangers to eliminate kickback movement. At Piazzale Curiel there is also an automated exchange with infrared remote control. The line is supplied with current by the following substations: Centro (formerly an ATAM depot, now a car park), Bellariva, Riccione Alba and Riccione Abissinia. Trolleybus fleet =Retired trolleybuses= The following trolleybuses previously used in Rimini have since been withdrawn from service: *5 Fiat 2401 Cansa nos. 1011-1015, delivered 1954, withdrawn c 1978. *17 Volvo B59 / Mauri nos. 1001-1017, delivered 1976-79, withdrawn 2002‚Äì2009. =Current fleet= Rimini's trolleybus fleet presently consists of six Van Hool AG300T articulated vehicles (fleet numbers 36501-36506), the first of which entered service in June 2010. (Note: this description was changed on June 18th, 2016. Actually I have seen busses No. 36502 - 06, so No. 501 still is not sure).

Celia is the daughter of Duke Frederick and niece of the banished Duke Senior. Celia and Rosalind are cousins but they have sisterly affection.  Physical appearance  Celia is beautiful, but with a beauty less sparkling than that of Rosalind. Orlando describes both of them as 'fair and excellent ladies'. Celia is shorter than her cousin and less majestic in appearance. She has a gentle expression combined with a habitual serious appearance. Hence Rosalind addresses her at one time as 'my pretty little coz', and at another as, 'sad brow and true maid'.  Love for Rosalind  Celia's love for Rosalind knows no limits and is frequently referred to in the play. Charles, the wrestler, relates that Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have followed Rosalind into exile in case Rosalind too had been banished along with her father. Le Beau, the courtier, describes their love as 'dearer than the natural bond of sisters'. This shows that her love for cousin is pure and supreme.  Character  Celia is silent and reserved. She is more conventional than Rosalind and hence more worldly and prudent. Her silence is in contrast to Rosalind's talkative nature. However, Celia, by her prudence, exercises command over herself as well as over others. When the two cousins are alone, Celia is full of life and humour, but in the presence of others she is content to play the part of a spectator. She first listens and judges what to speak, exactly opposite to Rosalind. Some consider that Celia's individual character has been overlooked by literary critics in favour of the more central character of Rosalind.  Marriage with Oliver  Celia's love for Oliver is sudden, intense and uncontrollable, despite the knowledge of Oliver's past wicked deeds. In this connection, it should be remembered that love in Shakespeare is an irrational passion. Celia's marriage with Oliver has been criticised by many critics. Stopford Brooke opines that this marriage is against probability because it looks strange that Oliver should change in a moment from the scoundrel. But her marriage with Oliver does not bring disgrace to her character. Oliver was a bad character but has changed into a good one by a sudden stroke. So Celia's marriage with Oliver is not a blot on her character.  Alternative interpretations  It has been suggested that Celia's role in the play is \\"subversive\\", in the sense that she adds to the sexual complications of the plot by her friendship with the cross-dressing Rosalind. Celia effectively sets up home with Rosalind in the forest, requiring no male presence, and her marriage to Oliver may be regarded as a means of prolonging their relationship rather than the result of any affection she feels for him.  Performance  Celia has been played by various notable actresses on screen. Sophie Stewart played Celia in a 1936 film, Rosalind Knight in the 1963 UK television series, Angharad Rees in the 1978 BBC version of the play directed by Basil Coleman, and Romola Garai in the 2006 production directed by Kenneth Branagh. In a 1985 production by the Royal Shakespeare Company, Celia was played by Fiona Shaw. Sophie Thompson played Celia with the Renaissance Theatre Company, and in 1989 it was her first role with the RSC.

The battle was an early instance of mounted infantry using Spencer repeating rifles during the war similar to the concurrent battle of Hoover's Gap. Background Following the retreat after the Battle of Stones River, Gen. Braxton Bragg, commander of the Army of Tennessee, established a fortified line along the Duck River from Shelbyville to Wartrace. On the Confederate right, infantry and artillery detachments guarded Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle gaps through the mountains. Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, commanding the Army of the Cumberland, feigned an attack on Shelbyville but massed against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward the gaps with George H. Thomas and the XIV Corps moved against Hoover's Gap. Moving against Liberty Gap was Alexander M. McCook and the XX Corps.ABPP: Hoover's Gap Battle On June 24 McCook sent a brigade under Colonel Luther P. Bradley against the Confederate pickets from General St. John R. Liddell's brigade holding the crossroads at the gap. Bradley's men were screened by Colonel Thomas J. Harrison's 39th Indiana Mounted Infantry Regiment armed with Spencer repeating rifles. Harrison's mounted infantry moved so quickly they captured the crossroad at a cost of only one man wounded. Hearing the gap was lightly defended, McCook wanted to take advantage of the situation and sent Brig. Gen. August Willich's Horn Brigade forward. Though the gap was held in fact only by two Arkansas infantry regiments and an artillery battery, Willich determined they were in a good defensible position. Willich attempted to flank the Confederates with the 32nd Indiana Infantry on the left and Harrison's mounted infantry on the right. The Union and Confederate forces launched attacks and counter-attacks while McCook sent forward the 77th Pennsylvanian and 29th Indiana infantry regiments for support. Liddell saw the futility of attempting to hold the gap and withdrew his forces.Battle of Liberty Gap On June 25 Liddell planned to renew the fight by stalling the Union advance through the gap. Liddell's division commander, Patrick R. Cleburne sent forward reinforcements. Late in the morning Liddell opened the fight against Willich's Union brigade. A see-saw battle ensued as both sides brought forward reinforcements. During the fighting Colonel John F. Miller of the 29th Indiana Infantry was seriously wounded, losing an eye.Eicher p.390 Willich also had an opportunity to test a tactic he developed while a prisoner of war he called ‚Äúadvanced firing‚Äù. Using the 49th Ohio Infantry Willich deployed the men in four rows. The first row fired a volley while the fourth row moved forward between the men to fire another volley. Continuing this process allowed the soldiers to keep up a continuous line of fire while moving forward at the same time.15th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Liddell's brigade was finally forced from the field while S.A.M. Wood's neighboring brigade was brought forward but darkness ended the fighting before Wood's men could effectively be brought into action leaving the Federals in control of the gap. Aftermath Although slowed by rain, Rosecrans moved on, forcing Bragg to give up his defensive line and fall back to Tullahoma. Rosecrans sent a flying column (Wilder's Lightning Brigade, the same that had spearheaded the thrust through Hoover's Gap on the 24th) ahead to hit the railroad in Bragg's rear. Arriving too late to destroy the Elk River railroad bridge, the Federals tore up much track around Decherd. Bragg evacuated Middle Tennessee. References * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher.

Four persons are also required to safely lift the trolley off the rail tracks when a train approaches. Use Rail tracks have a tendency to develop various defects including cracks, loose packing etc., which may lead to accidents. The first rail inspections were done visually. Push trolley inspections formed a very important part of these visual inspections. =Indian Railways= Although many railways in the world have switched to other methods of inspection, it is still widely used over Indian Railways in addition to other techniques, especially for inspecting railway track and assets like bridges which are situated between stations. The push trolley carries one or more officials inspecting the track and the railside equipment. The official carries instruments to measure and check the condition of the tracks and monitor the work being done by the trackmen, keymen, gatemen etc. who maintain, patrol, man the track and installations. The push trolley is also used by officials inspecting signalling installations in some parts of India. On routes carrying high volumes of traffic, such as the suburban section in Mumbai, push trolleys cannot be used and foot inspections are being resorted to. Advantages Push trolleys have a major advantage over motorised trolleys as they do not require any traffic block and the inspecting officials can carry out inspections at their leisure. Disadvantages The push trolleys are a potential safety hazard as they occupy track (albeit temporarily) and, if the trolley is not removed from track in time, it can collide with a train and cause an accident. Therefore, on sections having gradients or poor visibility, the push trolleys are not allowed without traffic blocks.

Her thirty-five novels and novellas have sold a total of about 2 million copies, and have received numerous awards, including the Romance Writers of America prestigious RITA, the Holt Medallion, the ACFW Book of the Year, the Daphne du Maurier, National Readers‚Äô Choice, the Booksellers Best, and the 2009 Best Books of Indiana-Fiction award. She was born January 19, 1952, in Wabash, Indiana. She was raised on a farm in Wabash County, Indiana, the eldest of four children. Her father, George Rhoads, was a farmer who also worked as a guard at General Motors. Her mother, Peggy Rhoads, was a housewife. She has three brothers: Randy (who died in 1990), Rick, and David. She graduated from Southwood High School, in Wabash County. Coble's early books were short historical romances published by Barbour Publishing under its Heartsong Presents imprint. The first four novels were set in Wyoming. Coble says she was inspired to write them when her brother Randy was killed by lightning on August 28, 1990. After a visit to Wyoming, where he had lived, she was inspired to do what she'd longed to do for several years: actually write a book. Wyoming became the setting for her first four romance novels, set in the wild West of the 1860s: Where Leads the Heart, Plains of Promise, The Heart Answers and To Love a Stranger . It took her a year to write the first one because she continued to work at her full-time job as a receptionist at Wabash Electric Supply, where she answered about 1000 phone calls a day. Coble says, \\"Born and raised in the Midwest (Indiana), I grew up on a farm with horses, pigs and chickens. I had plenty of adventure‚Äìfrom being dragged by my pony to running my brother Randy's motorcycle through a fence. Maybe that's why all my stories have action and adventure in them.\\" Bibliography =Rock Harbor Series= *Without a Trace (2003) *Beyond a Doubt (2004) *Into the Deep (2004) *Abomination (2007) *Cry in the Night (2009) *Silent Night (novella) (2012) *Beneath Copper Falls (2017) = YA/Middle Grade Rock Harbor = *Rock Harbor Search and Rescue *Rock Harbor Lost and Found (2013) = Children's Rock Harbor = * The Blessings Jar =Mercy Falls Series= *The Lightkeeper's Daughter (2010) *The Lightkeeper's Bride (2010) *The Lightkeeper's Ball (2011) =Standalones= * Alaska Twilight (2006) * Fire Dancer (2006) * Where Shadows Meet (formerly Anathema) (2008) * Butterfly Palace (2014) * The Heart Answers (2016) * To Love a Stranger (2016) * Because You‚Äôre Mine (2017) * Freedom‚Äôs Light (2018) * Strands of Truth (2019) =The Lonestar Series= *Lonestar Sanctuary (2008) *Lonestar Secrets (2009) *Lonestar Homecoming (2010) *Lonestar Angel (2011) *All is Calm (novella) (2014) =Aloha Reef Series= *Distant Echoes (2005) *Black Sands (2005) *Dangerous Depths (2005) *Midnight Sea (2007) *Holy Night (novella) (2013) =Love Inspired, Steeple Hill= *Windigo Twilight (2005) *Shadow Bones (2005) *Stormcatcher (2006) = Under Texas Stars Series= * Blue Moon Promise * Safe in His Arms (2013) * Bluebonnet Bride (novella) (2014) =The Hope Beach Series= * Tidewater Inn (2012) * Rosemary Cottage (2013) * Seagrass Pier (2014) * All Is Bright (2015) = Sunset Cove = * The Inn at Ocean‚Äôs Edge (2015) * Mermaid Moon (2016) * Twilight at Blueberry Barrens (2016) = Lavender Tides = * The View From Rainshadow Bay (2018) * Leaving Lavender Tides (2018) * The House at Saltwater Point (2018) * Secrets at Cedar Cabin (2019) = Journey of the Heart series = *A Heart's Disguise (2015) *A Heart's Obsession (2015) *A Heart's Danger (2015) *A Heart's Betrayal (2015) *A Heart's Promise (2015) *A Heart's Home (2015) References External links *Colleen Coble official homepage Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:American Christian writers Category:People from Wabash, Indiana Category:American historical novelists Category:American women novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American romantic fiction writers Category:Women romantic fiction writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Women historical novelists Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers ","title":"Colleen Coble"},{"id":"33261433","text":"Manuel Hern√°n Machuca Berr√≠os (born 6 June 1924, died 1985) was a Chilean football defender who played for Chile in the 1950 FIFA World Cup.1950 FIFA World Cup Brazil He also played for Colo-Colo.

The concept of timeshare donation is less than ten years old, but gains popularity each year as the timeshare resale market continues to falter. In recent years, due to a severely depressed timeshare resale market owners looking to sell their timeshare have little success. Timeshare owners also face a myriad of unscrupulous timeshare listing companies looking for large up-front fees with the promise that their timeshare will soon be out of their name. Typically the listing company cannot sell their timeshare, nor do they have an incentive because they can collect another listing fee after the original listing contract expires. For many timeshare owners, trying to sell their timeshare becomes a vicious cycle of broken promises, high fees, and little to no interest from buyers. According to the Florida Attorney General‚Äôs Office, timeshare owners are also especially vulnerable to timeshare resale scams. Ultimately, many owners look to simply give-away, or donate their timeshare to a willing party because their timeshare investment has become a liability. Methods Currently there are several methods to give-away or donate your timeshare. =Sale to relative or friend= The first is to find a willing relative or friend who might make good use of the timeshare. This method commonly involves selling the timeshare for $1 and proceeding with the formal transfer of title, typically performed by a timeshare closing and escrow company. =Donation to a charity= The second method is calling your favorite charity to see if they accept timeshare donations. Some charities are able to utilize timeshare weeks to generate revenue; by renting them to donors, or offering the vacation week for auction at a charity event. However, most charities are unable to take on deeded ownership of your timeshare, so they opt to sell the timeshare for you. If a charity sells the timeshare on your behalf and keeps the proceeds as the donation, the donor is then entitled to a tax deduction. =Donation in exchange for tax-deduction= The third method involves donating your timeshare to charity in exchange for a generous tax-deduction. Many large charities in the United States, such as Alzheimer's Association, and United Cerebral Palsy utilize a third-party to receive and process timeshare donations. If a donor‚Äôs timeshare donation is accepted into their particular program, the donor will receive a tax receipt for income tax purposes, along with additional info on how to process their charitable tax deduction. Donors can take the deduction if they itemize their taxes, and can utilize it on both federal and state returns. If the timeshare property is worth more than $5,000, you'll need a written appraisal in conformity with IRS standards. Publication 561 provides details on the form of written appraisal and the additional paperwork you'll need to attach to your return to secure the deduction. Of course, the danger lies in claiming that your timeshare is worth more than the true market value, i.e. resale value. According to the IRS, ‚ÄúFair market value is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of all the relevant facts.‚Äù In the depressed timeshare resale market, timeshares are worth far less than what people think they are worth. If you claim your timeshare is worth more than true market value, you could become vulnerable to an IRS audit as well as a stiff fine.http://redemptionandrelease.com/timeshare-donation-reviews/  References  Category:Timeshare ","title":"Timeshare donation"},{"id":"33261487","text":"Erik Ivan Bodin (20 July 1923 ‚Äì 29 August 1991) was a Swedish football defender who played for Sweden in the 1950 FIFA World Cup.1950 FIFA World Cup Brazil He also played for AIK Fotboll in Allsvenskan for 6 seasons.

He has been a members of the post-punk group The Members for over 40 years, and is an established film composer. Biography JC Carroll was born in Camberley on 9 February 1956 and attended Salesian College in Chertsey, Surrey. After playing in various school bands, Carroll's first taste of serious music was a 1974 chance meeting in the Three Mariners in Bagshot, Surrey, with pub rock pioneer and 1970s icon Graham Parker. They recorded a two-track 1/4-inch tape in Carroll's bedroom later to become known in Parker mythology as \\"The Akai Tapes\\". Parker went on to international acclaim, and Carroll settled into life as a bank clerk, living in a bedsit in Kilburn and writing songs on a battered acoustic guitar. A chance meeting on a train with Nicky Ritz, a graduate of Liverpool University, sometimes insurance salesman, singer, and beat poet with a talent for self-promotion led in 1977 to his being asked to join Ritz's band The Members. The Members' first single, \\"Solitary Confinement\\" (which Carroll co-wrote with Nicky Tesco), was released on Stiff Records. In the spring of 1979, the Members released their UK anthem \\"The Sound of the Suburbs\\" (which Carroll also co-wrote). This record went on to sell 250,000 copies in months. The track has been featured on hundreds of punk compilations. The album At the Chelsea Nightclub... gained critical approval and has been listed in Record Collector as one of the top 20 punk albums ever made. The Members recorded \\"Offshore Banking Business\\", a very early example of white reggae (with a political message). The Members then concentrated on the American and overseas market as they chalked up hits in America (\\"Working Girl\\") and Australia (\\"Radio\\") before becoming dormant in 1983. Carroll married Sophy Lynn in 1988, and they opened a boutique in Notting Hill Gate in London, named the Dispensary. The Dispensary later grew to four separate shops in Soho (London and Notting Hill Gate. The shop became a gathering place for the early acid house scene. During this period, he became more and more involved in the production and design of tee shirts then tailored clothing. Without any formal training, Carroll made trousers, jackets, overcoats, shirts, and leather jackets for the Dispensary. JC and Sophy had two children Grace Ivana and Irma Rose and worked together until 2002 when they separated. During the 1980s and 1990s, Carroll concentrated on playing the accordion and mandolin and studying various European and ethnic music. During this period, he recorded music with Sex Pistol Glen Matlock and New York Doll Johnny Thunders, playing both mandolin and accordion on Thunders' version of \\"Que Sera Sera\\". A chance meeting with film music composer Michael Kamen led to Carroll's being asked to play accordion on Don Juan DeMarco, featuring Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. In 2008, Carroll married his partner Sheila and re-established The Members as a live and recording band with original bassist Chris Payne and new drummer Nick Cash (temporarily replaced in 2010 by Rat Scabies of The Damned). In 2009, Carroll recorded The Golborne Variations, with Guy Pratt, Nick Cash, Chester Kamen, Chris Payne and Jennifer Pearl. Long-term collaborator and producer David M. Allen produced this album. In 2011, Carroll shot and edited a movie, with filmmaker Simon Godley, titled The Golborne Variations. This film premiered together with the first public performance of Golborne Variations at the 2011 Portobello Film Festival, where it won a special prize. In 2011, New Musical Express (NME) listed two of Carroll's songs, 1979's \\"Offshore Banking\\" and 2009's \\"Caveman TV\\" on a list of forgotten masterpieces. In 2012, Carroll produced and released two records on his own AngloCentric Label - The Members fourth studio album Ingrrland and a solo album titled 21st Century Blues (Released as Jay Cee Carroll). He also released a single using the stage name jPad titled \\"Totally Obsessed\\".

It is the seat of the Diocese of Stockton. Archbishop John J. Mitty of San Francisco approved the building of a new parish in the north side of Stockton in 1941. As the population of the city was growing to the north, the decision was made to build a \\"new\\" St. Mary's, and then eventually tear down the \\"old\\" St. Mary's downtown that had been built in 1893 and was in bad need of repair. Monsignor William E. McGough was the first pastor of the \\"new\\" St. Mary's. He worked with San Francisco architect Henry Minton and Stockton contractors Shepherd and Green to construct the modified-Gothic church. The building permit for the church was issued on March 5, 1941 for a building that would cost $175,000 and take approximately one year to build. As the Second World War began, the pace of building slowed but did not stop. The building had been fully paid for before construction was finished and the total cost was $285,000. The church was dedicated on December 12, 1942. The church is constructed of reinforced concrete, then faced with brick and ornamented with cast stone. The overall treatment is Gothic. A ninety-two-foot belfry tower is located in the northeast corner. Limestone steps lead to the entrance, which has a vaulted ceiling and terrazzo floor.

The episode was written by Elizabeth Meriwether, and directed by Jake Kasdan. The episode first aired on Fox in the United States on September 20, 2011 to positive reviews. Plot The show begins with Jessica \\"Jess\\" Day talking to her friend Cece, a model, about seducing her boyfriend by coming home early and stripping down for him. While talking to Cece on the phone, we hear that she is naked in the back of the cab wearing a big trench coat. When asked what her stripper name will be, she replies 'Rebecca Johnson', then 'Two Boobs Johnson', and later 'Tiger Boobs'. Jess comes home and her boyfriend Spencer is shocked to see her there, but he is cheating on her with another woman who comes out of the bedroom while Jess is attempting a striptease with pillows and bows. While doing a mediocre job on seducing him (taking off the trench coat and doing \\"sexy stuff' to various objects), the girl comes out and Jess is shocked. Now she lives with three single men (she found them on CraigsList and thought they were women) called Nick, Schmidt and Coach in an apartment. During most of the week she lives there, she begins to have mood swings about her break up such as watching Dirty Dancing. Her roommates are sick of it and invite her to a bar to find a man on the rebound. She ends up on a date but her date bails on her and he goes to the same party as her roommates are at. They all go to the restaurant and cheer Jess up by singing \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" proving that they do care about her as a friend. Production The episode was written by Elizabeth Meriwether, and directed by Jake Kasdan. The episode first aired on Fox in the United States on September 20, 2011. Speaking of the show Zooey Deschanel claimed that her character in New Girl resembles a younger version of herself. She said \\"I think Jess as a person, and the way that her personality is, has some of myself and especially some of my younger self,\\" she suggested. \\"[She resembles] my 13-year-old self.\\" Deschanel added that Jess will explore her lost youth after she is dumped by her long-term boyfriend. \\"I have to find a new support system, so I'm basically living my 20s as I approach my 30s,\\" she explained. Reception When the episode was first broadcast it pulled in more viewers than its lead in, the Fox comedy-drama Glee for the episode \\"The Purple Piano Project\\", which brought in 8.9m (5.4) in the 8:00 p.m. hour, after which New Girl launched with 10.1m (4.7). =Accolades= Jake Kasdan was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for this episode.

She sometimes used the pseudonyms Bessie Williams (she was not the only performer to use this name), Jane White, Dixie Gray, Rosa Green, and Mazie Leroy. Brown was active as a recording artist from 1923 to the mid-1930s. Songs she recorded include \\"I Wanna Jazz Some More\\" and \\"It's De-Lovely\\". Little is known of her life outside music. Career Brown was born in 1899 in New York. Most of her recordings were made in 1923 and 1924. In the 1930s she recorded one track with Les Brown's Band of Renown, a version of the Cole Porter song \\"It's De-Lovely\\". The title of her 1924 track \\"I Wanna Jazz Some More\\" is misleading. The word jazz was used as a euphemism for bodily fluid, not as a reference to the musical form. In the manner of the time, several of Brown's songs contained sexual innuendo, but not all her tracks were similarly slanted. Her debut session produced the songs \\"Evil Blues\\" and \\"Mean Eyes (Too Late Blues)\\". The former track had the notation \\"accompanied by Rickett Stars\\", almost certainly another stage name. Her main musical partner was the songwriter LeRoy Morton, who also acted as manager for Clara Smith. Brown and Morton recorded \\"He's Never Gonna Throw Me Down\\" and \\"Keep On Going\\" for Okeh Records. One of her later recording pseudonyms, Mazie Leroy, may have a connection with her association with Morton. As was becoming more common then, much of Brown's material came from the music-publishing arm of her record label. At a later session she recorded \\"Family Skeleton Blues\\", one of her more beguiling records. Among her accompanists was James \\"Bubber\\" Miley. It is likely that contractual agreements with record labels caused her to record with other companies under assumed names, some of which are difficult to verify. The amount of recording she undertook under various other names probably exceeds her output under her own name. Verification of recordings she made as Bessie Williams is difficult, as several other singers used that name. However, Brown has been identified as the singer on several records released on the Domino label, for which she was billed as Williams. Most of her known work is contained on the compilation album Female Blues Singers, Vol. 3: B/C (1923‚Äì1928), issued by Document Records in 1997. Allmusic.com. Her recordings include the songs \\"Evil Blues\\", \\"Mean Eyes (Too Late Blues)\\", \\"Deceitful Blues\\", \\"I Don't Let No One Man Worry Me\\", \\"He's Never Gonna Throw Me Down\\", \\"Keep On Going\\", \\"Family Skeleton Blues\\", \\"I Wanna Jazz Some More\\", and \\"One of These Days\\". According to the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc, she was living in a nursing home in Manhattan in 1990. The date of her death is unknown.

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 13, 2011. It was written by co-executive producer Justin Spitzer and was directed by David Rogers and marks Mindy Kaling's first credit as executive producer. \\"Garden Party\\" features guest appearances from Josh Groban, Dee Wallace and Stephen Collins. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) throws a garden party at Schrute Farms to impress Robert California (James Spader), with his parents and brother in attendance. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) works to make it a classy event. \\"Garden Party\\" features a substantial appearance by Josh Groban; Kaling had asked Groban if he could guest star in the series, through Twitter. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism towards its repetition of plot ideas. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Garden Party\\" drew more than 6 million viewers and received a 3.2 rating/8% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, staying even with the previous episode, \\"Lotto\\". It ranked third in its timeslot, and ranked as the highest-rated NBC series on Thursday. Synopsis Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) decides to throw a garden party at Schrute Farms to impress his parents and Robert California (James Spader), and exhaustively explains party manners to the office workers. Andy is jealous at the amount of attention his younger brother Walter Bernard, Jr. (Josh Groban) receives from his father, and thinks that by throwing an elaborate party he can ensure his father's blessings. At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy makes a toast to Robert in order to get his fellow employees to toast him, as if to show to his parents and California that he is valued by his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert, and Robert's toast is about the easiness of the manager job. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing \\"More Than Words\\" as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off. His father confronts him privately about his outburst, and when Andy admits to trying to win his father's affection, he reacts with annoyance, harshly telling him that he is simply not proud of Andy's accomplishments, and is annoyed at Andy's attempts to gain his approval. This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) wants to make the garden party a classy event to expand Schrute Farms' clientele. He thoroughly reads a book called The Ultimate Guide to Throwing A Garden Party that he bought online, actually written by Jim under the pseudonym \\"James Trickington\\". The book gives outlandish advice such as announcing each guest's name as they arrive in an extremely loud manner, imitating The Last Supper in the middle of a meal, dancing with his party staff, and a fire court dance as the closing ceremonies, all of which Dwight follows to the letter. Pam feuds with co-worker Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) over baby names. Pam and Angela learn they've both chosen the name Phillip for their soon-to-be-born sons, with Pam naming her child after her deceased grandfather and Angela after her favorite cat. Angela, annoyed that Pam does not relinquish the name, makes a toast to \\"my son Phillip\\" at the garden party‚Äîonly to have Pam make the same toast but describe in great detail how the name honors her grandfather. Angela, unwilling to reveal her feline- centric reasons for the name, simply grouses to the camera that Pam is always copying her. Throughout the party, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) keeps hinting how cold she is, hoping Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) will offer his jacket. However, Ryan instantly offers his jacket to Robert, who is not even cold. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) also offers his, hinting at a rivalry between them in terms of sucking up to Robert, later evidenced in \\"Pool Party\\". Dwight's cousin Mose (Michael Schur) has fun being a valet, lining up the guests' cars in a field to perform a motorcycle stunt. However, he fails to get his motorcycle up the ramp, and instead runs across the cars, but is still satisfied. Production Josh Groban appeared as Andy's younger brother, Walter Bernard, Jr. The episode was written by co-executive producer Justin Spitzer, his 10th writing credit for the series. It was directed by series editor David Rogers, his 4th directing credit for the series. Beginning with this episode, Mindy Kaling was promoted to executive producer. Before this, it was speculated that she might not return to the series as a writer. The episode features guest appearance from Stephen Collins, Dee Wallace and Josh Groban as Andy's father, mother and brother, respectively. Collins and Wallace were reported to appear on the series by Joyce Eng of TV Guide. Josh Groban was later reported to appear on the series the next day. Writer Mindy Kaling had sent Groban a message through Twitter asking if he would want to appear on the series. He responded yes with the filming week of the episode lining up with his Los Angeles concert for his Straight to You Tour. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on October 13, 2011, \\"Garden Party\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.050 million viewers and received a 3.2 rating/8% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.2% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 8% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Although seeing a 3.8% increase in viewership, the episode matched the 18‚Äì49 demo rating from the previous episode, \\"Lotto\\". The episode ranked third in its timeslot beating Person of Interest which received a 2.7 rating/7% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and The Secret Circle which received a 0.8 rating/2% share, but was defeated by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.4 rating/9% share and The X Factor which received a 3.6 rating/10% share. =Reviews= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall stated that the episode \\"offered more laughs than some of this season's other episodes\\". Despite this, he criticized the episode's main plot with Andy, commenting that \\"where giving Michael Scott power made him a funnier character than he would have been were he just another salesman, Andy has somehow become less funny since the promotion\\". Chris Plante of New York called the episode \\"funny, weird, touching, and unpredictable. A gem, really\\". National Post writer Barry Hertz compared the episode to \\"Booze Cruise\\", \\"Beach Games\\" and \\"The Search\\". M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-. Several critics praised the return of former Office writer, Michael Schur as Mose Schrute. Barry Hertz said that \\"the sight gag of him running atop a field of cars like a watered-down Evel Knievel was enough to give this episode an easy A\\". Despite this, the episode received some negative reviews. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt was more negative towards the episode writing that \\"Here, we have a case where an episode could have signaled at least some sense of what else the show might be interested in other than Andy as the well- meaning but hapless boss and Pam and Angela's dueling pregnancies, and all we got were variations on those storylines with no new angle either narratively\\". He gave the episode a C. IGN writer Cindy White considered the episode superior to previous \\"external\\" episodes \\"Christening\\" and \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\", but considered it inferior to the \\"Niagara\\" and the \\"classic\\" \\"Booze Cruise\\". She criticized the main plot for rehashing previous plot lines and ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10.

The ash was ejected from Mount Mazama, a volcano in south-central Oregon, during its climactic eruption about 7600 years ago when Crater Lake was formed by caldera collapse. The ash spread primarily to the north and east due to the prevailing winds, and remnants of the ash have been identified as far northeast as the Greenland ice sheet.Zdanowicz, C.M., Zielinski, G.A. and Germani, M.S. 1999.

Investigating the environmental impacts and cultural responses to the Mazama ashfall on the northern Plains. Geological Society of America, Abstracts with Programs, vol. 46, no. 6, p. 460. Age The climactic eruption of Mount Mazama during which the Mazama Ash was ejected occurred 7627 ¬± 150 calendrical years Before Present (5677 ¬± 150 B.C.E.), based on its identification in an ice core from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project. Distribution Mount Mazama's eruption timeline, showing ejection of ash and caldera collapse. The Mazama ash spread over an area of at least in the northern Great Plains, where it is most commonly preserved within peat, alluvial, lacustrine, and aeolian sediments.David, P.P. 1970. Discovery of Mazama Ash in Saskatchewan, Canada. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, vol. 7, p. 1579-1583.

Spectrophotometer analysis of Holocene sediments from an anoxic fjord: Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. Marine Geology, vol. 229, p. 15-28. In Canada, deposits of Mazama Ash several centimeters thick are commonly present in southern areas of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. In southern Alberta, about northeast of the eruption site, the Mazama Ash is typically found as a white band located several metres below the present ground surface. Shards of volcanic glass from the Mazama Ash have also been identified in the sediments of Lake Superior and in a bog in Newfoundland. Composition and identification The Mazama ash includes plagioclase, hypersthene, magnetite, hornblende, clinopyroxene, and volcanic glass.Kittleman, L.R. 1973. Mineralogy, correlation, and grain-size distributions of Mazama tephra and other post-glacial pyroclastic layers, Pacific Northwest. GSA Bulletin, vol. 84, no. 9, p. 2957-2980. It can be distinguished from other volcanic ash deposits, such as those from eruptions of Glacier Peak, Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier, by the unique chemistry of those constituents. This can be determined by electron microprobe analysis, by the refractive index of the volcanic glass, and by neutron activation analysisTheisen, A.A., Borchardt, G.A., Harward, M.E. and Schmitt, R.A. 1968. Neutron activation for distinguishing Cascade Range pyroclastics. Science, vol. 161, p. 1009-1011. and similar techniques. Radiocarbon dating of associated carbon-bearing material may also aid identification of the Mazama Ash. Impact Comparison with the effects of the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 indicates that the Mazama Ash would have covered the landscape in a blanket up to 15 cm (6 in) thick, coating vegetation and clogging watercourses throughout the ashfall area. This would have caused an immediate scarcity of resources for the native people and wildlife, necessitating the movement of people out of the main ashfall area. Available archeological evidence from a site in the Cypress Hills of southern Alberta suggests a hiatus in human occupation of the ash-affected area there of perhaps 200 years. The particles and gasses released during the Mazama eruption caused climate cooling. Studies of the Greenland ice core suggest that the eruption produced a substantial stratospheric aerosol loading spread over a period about 6 years. This may have produced a temperature depression of about 0.6 to 0.7 ¬∞C at mid to high northern latitudes for 1 to 3 years. The release of chlorine during the eruption may also have led to substantial depletion of stratospheric ozone.

It is a -long river that flows through the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. It arises from the southern Aintab plateau in southeastern Turkey. The Akpƒ±nar River in the Kilis plain is one of the headwaters of the Queiq. The former town of Qinnasrin lay on its banks. It partly flows along the western rim of the Matah Depression. The valley has been occupied for thousands of years and in ancient times the Queiq valley was noted for its flint industries and pottery. The river dried up completely in the late 1960s, due to irrigation projects on the Turkish side of the border. Recently, water from the Euphrates has been diverted to revive the dead river, and thus revive agriculture in the plains south of Aleppo, but many Syrians remain bitter towards the Turks over their handling of the river. Queiq-River Massacre In late January 2013, during the Syrian Civil War, the bodies of approximately 110 men and boys, most with hands bound behind the back, mouths sealed with tape, and gunshot wounds to the head, were found on the edges of the river in a part of Aleppo controlled by opposition forces. Very few of the victims were over 30. Many victims showed signs of torture. Human Rights Watch reported that family members of many of the victims testified that they were last seen in a government-controlled area or after they set out to cross into the area through two checkpoints, one manned by opposition forces and the other by government forces. Most of the families interviewed by Human Rights Watch insisted that the victims had not been involved with the armed opposition or actively participated in demonstrations. They said, in many cases, that the victims were merchants. Some had shops in the government-controlled area but lived in the opposition-controlled area, and others regularly crossed into the government-controlled area to buy supplies that they sold in markets in the opposition-controlled area. The victims are believed to have been detained, tortured, executed, and dumped by government forces into the river over a period of several weeks. The bodies floated downstream from a government held portion of the river into a rebel held portion in the Bustan al-Qasr district. The bodies only became apparent when the winter high waters receded in late January. In February, a grate was lowered from a bridge into the river in opposition held territory to help catch other bodies floating down. Between February and mid-March 2013, between 80 and 120 additional bodies were dragged from the river. An average of several bodies every day. The continual appearance of these bodies has led the Queiq River to be referred to as \\"The River of Martyrs\\" by locals. In March, a film crew from Britain's Channel 4, filmed residents pulling four bodies from the river on a single morning. At the end of March, Aleppo's opposition authorities reduced the level of the water in the river so it could no longer carry bodies downstream. As a result, locals have been spared from fishing out dead bodies from the river. The Syrian Institute for Justice investigated in this case and held a press conference to reveal the truth of that crime. Abdulkader Mandou, the Head Manager of Syrian Institute for Justice, who is a human rights attorney, is leading this case. He hopes that they may present this case file to an international tribunal as part of transitional justice in Syria.

In an article written by Khan and published in Inspire titled, \\"I am proud to be a traitor to America,\\" Khan outlined his grievances against the United States. According to Ben Venzke, CEO of IntelCenter, \\"The primary focus of the magazine is to inspire individuals to not just fly to Yemen and join the group, but rather to provide them with the inspiration, the ideological framework, the targeting philosophy and the practical mechanics of building a bomb or conducting a shooting.\\" In his book Ticking Time Bomb: Counter- Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack (2011), former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman described Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, American-Yemeni imam Anwar al-Awlaki, Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as \\"virtual spiritual sanctioners\\" who use the internet to offer religious justification for Islamist terrorism. It was reported in May 2013 that Al Qaeda devotees native to the United States may be using the instruction manuals that Khan has posted online before his death.

Duke Law School professor Scott Silliman asserted that Awlaki's activity \\"put him in the category of a legitimate target,\\" and University of Utah law professor Amos Guiora said, \\"This attack appears to have met the criteria of proportionality, military necessity and the absence of alternatives to be in full accordance with a state's right to aggressive self-defense.\\" Commenting on Khan's death, counter-terrorism expert Peter Bergen noted, \\"The fact that the editor of the magazine (Khan) has also been killed is a problem for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly as it relates to their Western recruitment effort, because the two people who principally spoke to the Western world are now dead.\\" After Khan's death, his family released a statement criticizing U.S. government and asking, \\"Was this style of execution the only solution?

Once he was given the chair, Wittichius found that Driessen continued to campaign against him, using an unauthorized Dutch translation of his Duisburg dissertation (anonymous but from the circle of Ruardus Andala); and his links to de Volder. Taco Hajo van den Honert of the University of Leiden moved in to defend Wittichius, and in the end he accepted a chair at Leiden instead. Leiden city and university now resisted outside pressure from Rotterdam in particular. Johann Franz Buddeus intervened, getting the Jena theology faculty to assert that the views of Wittichius were close to those of Spinoza and Abraham Joannes Cuffeler. Wittichius was comprehensively attacked in a pamphlet by Jacobus Leydekker in 1719. His position became a matter of wide discussion in the United Provinces; he defended himself by analogy with Johannes Bredenburg, and arguing that Cartesianism was effective against Spinozism.Israel, p, 439-43. Wittichius went on in combative fashion in his inaugural oration, with praise for Francis Bacon and Galileo, blame for the approach in philosophy of Gisbertus Voetius, employing Cartesian terminology, and making an allusion to Spinoza's Ethics. He continued to attack the views of Driessen and the Ro√´ll family. References *Jonathan I. Israel (2001), The Radical Enlightenment.

It was established in 1999 by its sole trustee, Michael J. Saylor. Since 2008, the focus of the foundation has been its Free Education Initiative which has led to the creation of 241 courses representing 10 of the highest enrollment majors in the US. The Saylor Academy's emphasis is assembling courses from openly available texts and resources. The foundation also funds the creation of new materials when needed, which is then openly licensed for use by other organizations and individuals. In March 2018 Edovo partnered with Saylor Academy. Courses On its website, the foundation offers 317 free, college-level courses, which are selected as typical courses in high enrollment majors at traditional U.S. colleges. Content is accessible without needing to register or log into the website, however an account is required to gain access to final exams, and a free certificate of completion. The foundation works with consultants to design the courses, typically university and college faculty members or subject experts. The consultant develops a blueprint for the course, then researches open educational resources (OER) to supply the course with lectures, texts, and other resources. If suitable texts and documents are not found, the foundation works with faculty to compile new materials which it releases to the OER community under a Creative Commons license. Each course is accompanied by an assessment. After OER materials are assembled into the course format, the material is peer-reviewed for accuracy, quality, and comparability to similar courses at a U.S. college. Each peer-review is completed by a group of consultants, usually consisting of two professors and a graduate student. Individual courses are approved by the American Council of Education (ACE), the leading trade organization of American colleges and universities. Accreditation and credentialing The Saylor Academy is not accredited within any traditional system, but they have been featured as a candidate for launching a system of alternative accreditation through the use of badges. The foundation has stated its intentions to tap into the soon to be released Open Badge Infrastructure from the Mozilla Foundation. This project by the Mozilla Foundation, in tandem with the HASTAC organization, will allow website operators to issue and display badges within a single inter-operable and open source system.Mozilla Open Badges Project Through cooperation with other organizations, the Saylor Academy can offer degrees, that are nevertheless low cost.

After finishing his education he entered the civil service. In 1852, while in France, he joined the Catholic Church, following the conversion of his close university friend Julian Astromov. On 27 June of that year, Balabin entered the Jesuit novitiate. In 1853 he was found guilty in Russia of \\"apostasy from Orthodoxy.\\" The sentence for this was \\"to be deprived of all rights of [noble] status, recognized as eternally exiled from the boundaries of the Russian state and in the event of their unauthorized residence in Russia, to be banished to Siberia for perpetual exile.\\".Catherine Evtuhov and Stephen Kotkin, The Cultural Gradient: The Transmission of Ideas in Europe, 1789-1991, Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, , p. 36. After completing his novitiate, Balabin entered the Society of Jesus. From 1854 to 1859 he studied at a seminary at Vals near Le Puy-en-Velay in France. From 1855, he was an active assistant of Ivan Sergeyevich Gagarin and Ivan Mikhailovich Martynov in the organization of the Parisian Society of Cyril and Methodius and the development of what became the \\"Slavic Library\\" in Meudon, near Paris.Evtuhov and Kotkin, p. 51. In 1861, Balabin visited Constantinople as part of an effort to create a Bulgarian Jesuit college.Jeffrey Bruce Beshoner, Ivan Sergeevich Gagarin: The Search for Orthodox and Catholic Union, University of Notre Dame Press, 2002, p. 135. However, Balabin had less ambitious plans than Gagarin for a Jesuit presence in the East, writing \\"In his solicitude for the salvation of our brothers of the East, Gagarin has conceived of many projects for the seminary to be established at Jerusalem, in Syria, and we speak often; but these projects seem impractical.\\" In 1863, Gagarin, Martynov, and Balabin founded a journal, named Kirillo-Mefodievskii Sbornik, aimed at unifying the Russian Orthodox and Catholic churches. However, this journal ceased publication in 1867. The efforts of Balabin and other Jesuits to convert Russians to Roman Catholicism influenced the young Andrey Sheptytsky, later Metropolitan of Lviv. In 1880, the Jesuits were expelled from France. From 1888, Balabin worked at the Coll√®ge de la Sainte Famille in Cairo, Egypt. He died on January 30, 1895 in Cairo.

and Immigration Compliance Act requires that all public employers, contractors and subcontractors register and comply with the federal work authorization program operated by the United States Department of Homeland Security to verify new employee work eligibility. Enactment On April 17, 2006, The Georgia Security and Immigration Compliance Act (GSICA) was authored by Georgia State Senator Chip Rogers, carried in the House by Georgia State Representative John Lunsford and signed into law by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue. The Law later took effect on July 1, 2007. Provisions and legislative intent The GSICA required that all public employers, contractors and subcontractors register and comply with the federal work authorization program operated by the United States Department of Homeland Security to verify new employee work eligibility. The GSICA was created in an effort to address illegal immigration problems in the following areas: private employment, public employment and contracting, public safety, and public benefits. It prevents any business from claiming certain wages paid to unauthorized employees as permissible business expense for state income tax purposes. The law requires citizenship verification for individuals older than the age of 18 who are receiving local, state, or federal benefits. In addition, authorities are obligated to verify the immigration status of any foreign national who receives jail time for a felony or DUI. If found to be in the country illegally authorities are to report unauthorized individuals to the Department of Homeland Security. The GSICA also provides modifications to the criminal code making it a felony to participate in or be affiliated with the trafficking of individuals for labor or sexual slavery.  Major features of The Georgia Security and Immigration  I. Citizenship Verification Requires that all individuals receiving benefits from the state sign either an affidavit stating that they are a citizen of the United States or a legal alien. II. Employee Verification Requires all public employers, contractors and subcontractors to verify new employee information by entering it into the federal database, also referred to as the Federal Basic Pilot Program. III. Tax Benefit Prohibitions Annual wages of over $600 a year from undocumented employees are prohibited from being claimed as an allowable business expense for state income tax purposes. IV. Tax Withholding Requirement Excluding federal tax withholding, a 6 percent state withholding tax is required for 1099 employees who fail to do the following: provide a taxpayer identification number, provide a correct taxpayer identification number, or provide a nonresident taxpayer identification. V. Law Enforcement Authorities are responsible for enforcing federal immigration and customs laws to those found not to be in the country legally. VI. Human Trafficking If found guilty of human trafficking or contributing, a felony punishable by 1‚Äì20 years imprisonment or 10‚Äì20 years for victims under age 18 will be enforced. VII. Citizenship Verification for Individuals Charged with Felony or DUI Requires that the legal status of individuals charged with a felony or DUI be verified to prove U.S. citizenship. If an individual is proven to be an illegal resident notification to Immigration and Customs Enforcement is required. VIII. Immigration Assistance Non-attorneys in the business of providing assistance to immigrants are required to post signs stating that they are not allowed to give legal advice and are not lawyers.  Background on Local Immigration Enforcement  The power to regulate immigration has been thought to be exclusively federal, however, states and localities have played a role as well in the regulation of immigration. In the twentieth century states have exercised their right to enforce restrictions on the access immigrants have regarding state benefits such as welfare as well as public employment restrictions that were placed on employers who hired unauthorized workers. State and local efforts that have been made to prohibit employers from hiring unauthorized workers have two key historical features in common: First, it is declared unlawful to knowingly recruit, hire for employment, or continue to employ any individual who is an illegal worker. Second, employers are required to enter all employee information in the federal government's E-Verify program. Historically, state and local governments have sought to enter cooperative agreements with the federal government that would allow local law enforcement authorities to enforce federal immigration law directly. Laws have also been passed requiring police to report the immigration status of those arrested or detained for serious crimes. When public officials, including police, become involved in immigration enforcement, law enforcement is then compromised. The question then becomes whether or not the state and local police have been awarded inherent constitutional authority authorizing the arrest of immigrants who are in violation of federal immigration law. In 1996 Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act adding Sec. 287(g) which gave authorization to state and localities to enter into agreements with the federal government that would give state and local officials authority to arrest and detain individuals accused of violating federal immigration laws. States and localities that agreed with this addition to the Immigration and Nationality Act received special training and required supervision by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There is a history of problems associated with the federal government entering agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies that give them permission to identify individuals who are in the country illegally. Both legal and illegal immigrants are susceptible to exploitation by the power given to law enforcement to exercise the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In fiscal years 2006‚Äì2008, ICE received about $60 million to train, supervise, and equip program participants. As of October 2008, ICE reported enrolling 67 agencies and training 951 state and local law enforcement officers. The ICE has created some management controls that allow it to govern Sec 287(g) that are in some ways flawed and limited. The program lacks documented objectives which allows for inconsistency in its practice, and it also requires supervision but does not describe the nature and extend of that supervision. This allows for local law enforcement to act on instinct and personal prejudices without fear of consequence, which has led to community fears of racial profiling and intimidation. State and local participation in immigration enforcement have raised policy concerns. It creates policy dangers such as the risk of racial profiling by employers and police which directly affect immigrants and surrounding communities.

Almost all database operations are performed in batch mode, i.e. the user issues a query and waits till the database has finished processing the entire query. On the contrary, using online aggregation, the user gets estimates of an aggregate query in an online fashion as soon as the query is issued. For example, if the final answer is 1000, after k seconds, the user gets the estimates in form of a confidence interval like [990, 1020] with 95% probability. This confidence keeps on shrinking as the system gets more and more samples. Online aggregation was proposed in 1997 by Hellerstein, Haas and Wang for group-by aggregation queries over a single table. Later, the authors showed how to evaluate joins in an online fashion. In 2007, Jermaine et al. designed and implemented a prototype database system called Database-Online (or DBO) that computes group-by aggregate query over multiple tables in an online and more importantly in a scalable fashion. All the approaches for online aggregation use random sampling, which is non-trivial in a distributed environment due to inspection paradox of renewal reward theory. In 2011, Pansare et al. proposed a Bayesian model to deal with the inspection paradox and implemented online aggregation for a MapReduce-like environment.

The monument celebrates the heroes of the struggles of the Indonesian nation symbolized by a peasant youth wearing a caping with a rifle on his shoulder, a mother behind him offering him a dish of rice. The caping is a traditional farmer's hat in Indonesia, thus the statue is also referred as the Farmer's Monument (Patung Pak Tani or Tugu Tani). History and design The idea for the creation of the statue was initiated by Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, when he visited Moscow in the late 1950s and was impressed with the statues in the city. He was introduced to a Socialist realist sculptor Matvey Manizer and his son Ossip Manizer. In order to inspire them, Sukarno invited the sculptors to Indonesia to build a statue which embodies the fight to achieve independence, which at that time Indonesia was fighting for the freedom of West Irian from the Dutch colonialism. While exploring a rural village in West Java, the sculptors were inspired by a folklore about a mother who supported her son to win the war and to remember his parents and his land as well as giving him some rice for his journey. The statue was built in the Soviet Union and brought to Indonesia by ship. It was inaugurated in 1963. The statue sits at the junction of Menteng and Prapatan Street, which had been an important place during the days of the August 1945 revolution. The statue has been controversial since armed peasants are sometimes identified with communism. There is a caption on the pedestal, a sentence by Sukarno: ::\\"HANJA BANGSA JANG MENGHARGAI PAHLAWAN PAHLAWANNJA DAPAT MENJADI BANGSA JANG BESAR\\" ::(English: \\"ONLY NATION THAT EXALTS ITS HEROES COULD BE A GREAT NATION\\") Accident and Incident On 22 January 2020, a Daihatsu Xenia crashed a bus stop near the monument and killed 9 people around the pedestrian path. the suspect Afriyani Susanti was driving home from nearby Hotel Borobudur and presumed to be in a drunken state References Cited works * * Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1963 Category:Monuments and memorials in Jakarta Category:Post-independence architecture of Indonesia Category:Buildings and structures in Jakarta ","title":"Heroes Monument, Jakarta"},{"id":"33262199","text":"Vera Vasilchikova Vera Vasilchikova (n√©e Protasova, 1780 ‚Äì October 2, 1814), was a maid of honour, the first wife of General Hilarion Vasilyevich Vasilchikov and dame of the Order of Saint Catherine (1814). Biography Vera Vasilchikova was one of the daughters of the senator and governor of the Kaluga Peter S. Protasov (1730‚Äì1791) and his wife, Alexandra Ivanovna, n√©e Protassova (1750‚Äì1782). In early childhood, she lost her parents and she and her sisters, Alexandra, Catherine, Barbara, and Anne were brought up under the auspices of their aunt Anna Stepanovna, which was the favourite lady-in- wairing of Catherine II. She gave her nieces brilliant concepts for the then education, and the focus was drawn to foreign languages, including Latin and Greek at the expense of Russian, which they did not teach, as well as national history and religion. Barbara, Vera and Anna lived with her in the palace and were appointed maids of honour. On September 15, 1801, Anna Stepanovna Protasova was \\"elevated to the dignity of Countess of the Russian Empire,\\" but after two days' condescending to request of Countess Anna Protassova, the comital dignity was graciously extended to her nieces, daughter of the late Lieutenant-General Peter Protasov. In 1801, Vera Petrovna became the first wife of General Hilarion Vasilchikov (1776‚Äì1847), son of Vasilii Alekseevich and Catherine Illarionovna, n√©e Ovtsyna. Despite the fact that the marriage was not happy, the couple had two children: * Hilarion (1805‚Äì1862), Adjutant General, Kyiv, Volyn and Podolsk Governor General, a member of the Council of State. * Catherine (died 1842), the wife of the Kursk and Kharkov Governor Lieutenant-General I. D. Luzhin. Together with her sisters Alexandra Galitzine, Countess Catherine Rostopchina and Barbara Protassova she adopted Catholicism, converted themselves from Russian Orthodoxy.

It is the second story of the fifth and last series. Plot =Part 1= At school, Clyde shows Rani The Silver Bullet, a comic he made. While Sarah Jane has a talk with Haresh on Sky's first day at school, a strange storm interrupts the meeting‚Äîfish begin to fall out of the sky. Mr Smith later explains that raining fish is a natural, if unusual, phenomenon, though the fish that day were abnormally large. Thinking it might be related to an old legend involving an old Mojave totem pole now on display in a local museum, the gang visits the exhibition. Outside the museum, Clyde gives a homeless girl some money, explaining to Sky that it probably is not her fault she is out in the streets. Disregarding signs not to touch the exhibits, Clyde gets a splinter from the totem pole they have come to see. Dr Madigan, the anthropologist in charge, explains the legend of the totem pole. Hetocumtek was a vicious god who fell out of the skies and tried to enslave the people on the Mojave plains. The Native American medicine men tricked the god, imprisoning him inside the totem pole. Sarah Jane suspects that Hetocumtek was an alien masquerading as a warrior god. However, a scan detects no alien signs of any kind. That night, Clyde finishes his comic and signs his name on it before falling asleep. He fails to notice that his name on all of his documents, including his comic, mysteriously begins to glow orange. Walking to Sarah Jane's house, Clyde shows her The Silver Bullet. She at first takes interest in his comic. At the mention of his name, Clyde's name glows orange in Sarah Jane's eye. Suddenly, Sarah Jane takes a dislike to Clyde, ordering him to leave her house. At the front of the Chandras' residence, Clyde tries to tell Rani and Haresh the problem he had with Sarah Jane, only to face the same conflict when Haresh says his name as it glows in their eyes. Haresh then expels him from school and Rani says she hates him. Getting ready for her first day of school, Sky enters the attic. Sarah Jane tells her she will return to the museum to see if there are any connections between the totem pole and the fish incident. When Sky mentions Clyde to Sarah Jane, she is instructed to stay away from him. Unaffected by the curse, Sky notices the sudden hatred Sarah Jane has for Clyde. At the park, Clyde is treated kindly by his old friend Steve until his name is said. Barely escaping from Steve and his gang who are chasing after him, he enters the museum. While he is asking Dr Madigan about curses, Sarah Jane enters the museum and advises her to keep away from Clyde. Dr Madigan orders the security guards to throw him out. Clyde returns home where he sees his mother, Carla, staring at an envelope addressed to him. She says he has ruined her life and tells him to leave. Realising what has happened, he begs Carla to let him stay. When the police arrive, following a complaint from Sarah Jane, he runs away. Out in the streets in the middle of the rain, the homeless girl he helped offers to assist him, holding out her hand, which he takes. =Part 2= While his friends all turn on Clyde as a result of the curse, the mysterious girl on the streets helps him through the hardship of losing his friends and loved ones. She introduces herself as Ellie. Fearing the curse, Clyde introduces himself as Enrico Box taking inspiration from a nearby pizza box. Ellie tells him about the Night Dragon, how people mysteriously disappears because of it. At the museum, lightning bursts out of the totem pole. Sarah Jane is called in to investigate. Scanning, Sarah Jane receives detections of alien energy. She then sees one of the faces' eyes on the pole glow orange. Meanwhile, Sky at school notices how Sarah Jane and Rani hate Clyde but cannot explain their change of attitude. Sarah Jane suddenly tears up in the attic although she does not know why. The same thing occurs to Rani later in the car, as well as to Carla when Sky visits her. All of them feel as if they are missing a big part of their life. Clyde and Ellie visits Mystic Mags, a psychic, who tells them the Night Dragon is coming and that it will take one of them. She also foresees something else that has put a mark on Clyde, a curse. The totem pole back at the museum begins to cause the weather to rain and thunder heavily as the faces begins to become alive. Within the rain, Clyde and Ellie connect with each other, keeping themselves warm by burning The Silver Bullet. Back in the attic, Sarah Jane and Rani share their feelings of distress. Sky, after being informed that Hetocumtek is getting stronger, guesses that Clyde activated the warrior god when he receives a splinter, creating the curse. She realises that as long as Clyde is out in the streets, the alien warrior god will get stronger. Sky also sees that his name is the key to stopping Hetocumtek. She manages to convince Sarah Jane and Rani to say his name repeatedly to break the curse upon them. Clyde draws a portrait of Ellie and shows it to her. She then kisses him and tells him she will be back, leaving to get coffee. Sarah Jane and the gang arrive, bringing Clyde to the attic, though it was without choice. There, Mr Smith transports the totem pole to the attic where it begins to fight back, creating lightning and destruction. Clyde, holding onto the pole, shouts, \\"My name is Clyde Langer!\\" disintegrating the pole. Clyde, welcomed back by his friends and family, tries to search for Ellie. He asks many people only to find they do not know where or who she is. Clyde suggests they use Mr Smith to track her, but Rani points out her name on a sign, indicating that Ellie took the name. A man there saw Ellie board a truck named \\"Night Dragon Haulage\\". He explains that the truck driver occasionally would drive some people to other places for a better life. At night in his room, Clyde reminisces about Ellie as he stares at his portrait of her.

Design and development The P-51G is a full-size representation of the second world war Mustang. The design was started in 1988 with a first flight in 1998. It was displayed in public at Oshkosh in July 1998 as the Grand 51 but was subsequently renamed the P-51G. The P-51G is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with an airframe made from carbon fiber epoxy. Of similar lines to the original Mustang, the prototype was fitted with a Lycoming T53-L-701A turboprop with a three-bladed tractor propeller from an Grumman OV-1D Mowhawk. The P-51G has a hydraulically operated retractable conventional landing gear with a retractable tailwheel. The main landing gear utilize components from North American T-6 landing gear. The two-seat cockpit has the pilot and passenger in tandem under a hinged one-piece canopy, the company does have a P-51D-style framed canopy available as an option. The Mustang-style under- fuselage air scoop is a dummy that provides a baggage compartment. The design blends features of various P-51 models. The fuselage closely resembles the P-51D, but has features from the light weight P-51G model. The wing uses the P51-H model wing and has been shortened to 32 feet. The wet wing design holds 450 gallons of fuel. The prototype aircraft does not have flaps since the turbine engine propeller has beta control to assist in stopping. A production agreement to assemble complete aircraft was made in 1996 with Exclusive Aviation located in Fargo, North Dakota to build two aircraft. Cameron supplied an engine and parts for the two aircraft. SPW Associates entered into a loan agreement with Exclusive Aviation in 1997. In 1998 Exclusive Aviation had defaulted on this loan. On August 18, 1998 a ‚ÄúTransfer of Collateral Upon Peaceable Foreclosure and Renunciation‚Äù granting possession of the completed first airplane to SPW was signed. In May 1999, Cameron filed a lien against the airplane with the FAA. The ownership of the sole aircraft has been in litigation from the 2002 until 2006 when the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the aircraft belonged to SPW Associates. After the North Dakota Supreme Court judgement, the aircraft was put for sale.

It is the third and final story of the fifth series, and the final appearance of all the main cast, including the final appearance of Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith following the actress' death from cancer earlier that year. Plot =Part 1= A woman who works as a cleaner watches the commercial for the SerfBoard at Serf Systems. Walking, she suddenly hears an odd noise coming from a lift. There, a mysterious figure snatches her. Luke returns home from university and he meets Sky for the first time. Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani are also happy to see him. Luke also realises that his old room is now Sky's and as he mentions the fact that it is no longer his room, Sky feels guilty. Luke explains that K9, along with having a dog whistle to call him, could not leave Oxford and as Mr Smith expresses his delight, Rani jokes that they could replace Mr Smith with the new SerfBoard. Sarah Jane reveals that she has been chosen to see a run through of the speech that Joseph Serf (the creator of the SerfBoard) will present. She takes Luke and Sky with her to the run through and she bumps into Lionel Carson, her old editor, who has a dislike of computers. As the run through gets underway and Joseph Serf is giving his speech, Luke and Sky notice Serf's face suddenly glitch. Once Sarah Jane and Lionel have received a SerfBoard, Lionel takes an odd liking to the board, Luke and Sky tell Sarah Jane what they saw. Sarah Jane and Sky return home while Luke stays to see if anything suspicious happens. They get Mr Smith to display the video of the speech and it is confirmed that Joseph Serf glitched. As they go through his past, they discover that Joseph Serf was involved in a skiing accident and then disappeared into seclusion. This leads Sarah Jane to conclude that the real Joseph Serf died in the skiing accident and the one that was seen in the run through was a hologram. Sarah Jane organises an interview with Joseph Serf by using cryptic wording which suggests she knows that Serf is a hologram. Sarah Jane, Luke, and Sky go to meet Serf. In the attic, Clyde and Rani scan the SerfBoard to uncover anything alien about it, only to discover that it is just a cheap, poor quality laptop computer. Sarah Jane plans her interview with Joseph Serf and his bodyguard Harrison is adamant on staying with them. As Sarah Jane discovers the truth that Joseph Serf is a hologram, Luke and Sky go into a basement and discover that an alien race is controlling the Joseph Serf image. Sarah Jane, with no other options, finally wafts her arms through the hologram. Harrison then targets an alien weapon at her. Meanwhile, the aliens notice Luke and Sky and enclose around the two. =Part 2= The aliens, called Skullions, warn Luke and Sky to flee. In order to buy time for Sarah Jane's escape, Sky pulls a trigger in the control room, momentarily malfunctioning the Serf hologram. Harrison, who has some sort of connection to the Skullions, pulls out his pen and presses a button, temporarily torturing the Skullions via collars on all of their necks. Sarah Jane, Luke, and Sky are all captured. Harrison reveals that he bought the enslaved Skullions from a Chinese black market after their ship crashed in China. Though the SerfBoard has nothing special about it, the Joseph Serf hologram has a hypnotic setting controlled by the Skullions that can make people want to buy the product, mainly targeted at the audience of the upcoming launch, both live and televised; Harrison will subsequently make a fortune from the SerfBoard's success. He then separates Sarah Jane from the teenagers, placing her in a locked room with the custodian. In another room, Luke and Sky converse, especially about Sky thinking Luke misses his old room. Plark, a Skullion, comes in, giving them water. Luke offers some water for the alien, but he refuses for it will burn, and explains the Skullions can only drink citric juices. Though K9 will not be able to hear the sounds, Luke uses his dog whistle to contact Mr Smith in Morse code, telling Clyde and Rani to grab Harrison's pen. The custodian, Adriana, tells Sarah Jane what she saw and how the Skullion who grabbed her earlier was punished by the guards before she was thrown into the room. Agreeing to the plan, Adriana screams, pretending to be abused by Sarah Jane. A security guard then enters and trips upon a wire. Sarah Jane and Adriana escape, locking the guard behind them. They arrive where Luke and Sky are imprisoned and free them. Before the broadcast of the SerfBoard, Harrison warns the Skullions of their punishments should they make a mistake during the launch: the punishment of death. To emphasise Harrison's \\"message\\", he sprays water on the Skullions. Clyde and Rani, after receiving Luke's message through Mr Smith, take the identities of Trevor and Janet Sharp, a married couple stranded at an airport due to a computer malfunction engineered by Mr Smith. At the launch, Clyde manages to switch pens with Harrison without him noticing Clyde did so. Sarah Jane calls Mr Smith, telling him to contact a rescue vehicle from Skultos. The Skullions run up towards the roof. Unfortunately, Harrison forcibly takes his pen back from Rani. Stalling, Luke and Sky try to control the hologram but fail to operate it correctly. Harrison then presses the button on his pen and initiates the level 10 maximum punishment causing the Skullions immense pain. Luke and Sky use the Serf hologram's hypnotic power to compel the audience to grab the pen and smash it. After Lionel smashes the pen underfoot, Serf tells the audience the SerfBoard is rubbish, sending them home with the job to tell others about the ridiculous SerfBoard. The Serf hologram then tells Clyde and Rani to go to the roof, which Harrison overhears. On the roof, the rescue spaceship arrives. As the Skullions head for the beam, Harrison runs after them in anger and grabs on to Plark, resulting in the ship beaming both him and Skullions up. Adriana, who now has no job, is given by Sarah Jane a business card pertaining to UNIT and a recommendation that UNIT could use someone like her. Back home, Luke finally accepts that it is Sky's room and she walks in on him hanging up a picture drawn by Clyde, titled, \\"Sky's Room\\". As a final montage of her past adventures in the series play, Sarah Jane voices over: The episode closes over an image of Earth with the on-screen text, \\"And the story goes on... forever.\\" Continuity * Sarah Jane's final speech at the conclusion of this story is an amalgamation of used and unused takes of Elisabeth Sladen's closing voiceover from the Series 1 finale The Lost Boy. * A sequence of past clips from the series was played. Among them included a footage of Sarah Jane hugging The Doctor in \\"Journey's End\\" and a clip from \\"The End of Time\\", both from the Doctor Who series. * The Skullions were previously mentioned by Jack Harkness in the Torchwood episode \\"The Gathering\\". The Torchwood team supposedly tracked down a Chinese black market that sold alien artifacts, including Skullion metal. The Skullions made a cameo appearance in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\".

It assumes that the cosmological constant is exactly zero, which is only the case for models with exact unbroken supersymmetry. Because the energy density does not approach zero as we approach spatial infinity, the metric is not asymptotically flat. This is not an asymptotically cold solution. Overview In eternal inflation, our universe passes through a series of phase transitions with progressively lower cosmological constant. Our current phase has a cosmological constant of size 10^{-123}, which is conjectured to be metastable in string theory. It is possible our universe might tunnel into a supersymmetric phase with an exactly zero cosmological constant. In fact, any particle in eternal inflation will eventually terminate in a phase with exactly zero or negative cosmological constant. The phases with negative cosmological constant will end in a Big Crunch. Shenkar and Leonard Susskind called this the Census Taker's Hat. The conformal compactification of the terminal phase has a Penrose diagram shaped like a hat for future null infinity. A Euclidean Liouville quantum field theory is assumed to reside there. The null coordinate corresponds to the running of the renormalization group. The terminal phase has an ever-expanding FRW metric in which the average energy density goes to zero.

Retrieved September 29, 2011Directory of executive positions Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej. Retrieved October 1, 2011 Her older siblings were active in a socialist/communist circle and in 1936, she joined the Communist Party of Poland. In 1938, she and another active Party member, Wincenty Jan Rutkiewicz, known as \\"Wicek\\", were married. It was a difficult time. Joseph Stalin's Great Purge had eliminated a number of the Polish Communist Party's leaders and in 1939, Hitler invaded the country. Thousands of Polish soldiers were sent to German prisoner of war camps and there was an order to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia, that spelled out who was in danger. With her husband, then a soldier, taken prisoner of war, Rutkiewicz fled to Bialystok in Russian-occupied Poland. After Hitler invaded Russia in 1941, she fled to Moscow and was recruited into the initiative group of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and trained as a radio operator. She joined a cell of Polish communists led by Marceli Nowotko that was to parachute into Poland and work in the communist resistance. After one practice jump, the group landed outside Warsaw in the early hours of 28 December 1941. Her husband joined her in Warsaw, having escaped his imprisonment. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was crushed in May 1943, the Nazis turned their attention to the Polish underground. All but one of Nowotko's cell were caught and shot. Wicek Rutkiewicz was arrested in July and sent to Auschwitz; in September 1943, the Gestapo burst in on a pregnant Maria Rutkiewicz transmitting radio messages to Moscow. She was beaten, arrested and taken to Pawiak prison, but then brought back to Gestapo headquarters for interrogation, which included more beatings. The Gestapo told her that because of her condition, they would be humane and only beat her about the face. When she was returned to the prison, the supervisor was unable to recognize her. Rutkiewicz had been told she would be shot. Meanwhile, she found out she was carrying twins. Polish doctors befriended her and persuaded the Germans to postpone her execution till after the babies were born, twins being a \\"medical opportunity\\" for Nazi doctors. Rutkiewicz gave birth on 16 February 1944 to a boy and a girl. She soon learned through the prison underground that her husband had no idea what had become of her and was desperately trying to find out. With the help of a criminal prisoner, she managed to have a photograph taken of herself with the babies, which she then was able to smuggle to her husband in Auschwitz. As the war progressed and the Nazis began to sense defeat, their focus was on destroying documents and the evidence of their crimes. Despite fears she would soon be executed, Maria Rutkiewicz was able to leave the prison with her babies in summer 1944. Though her husband survived Auschwitz, he perished at Sachsenhausen at the end of the war. Rutkiewicz also lost her mother and two brothers. Her mother was shot by Nazis; one brother was killed in the army in 1939 and the other fought in the French resistance, was captured and died at Auschwitz. Postwar years After the war, Rutkiewicz worked for the Central Committee of the PPR/PZPR and the Union of Polish Youth as a secretary, later becoming an editor. She worked at Iskra and Gromady. She was later married to Artur Starewicz, Polish ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1972 to 1978, and lived in London. In 1978, she was featured in a British television series called Women of Courage about four women who risked their lives in standing up to the Nazis. The other women were Mary Lindell, a British woman; Sigrid Helliesen Lund, a Norwegian; and Hiltgunt Zassenhaus, a German. Maria Rutkiewicz died on 27 June 2007, a month before her 90th birthday.

Though briefly Raja of Amber, for the majority of his life Askaran was the ruler of Narwar. He also had a distinguished career as a military officer under the Mughal emperor Akbar and rose high in his service. Background Askaran was born a younger son of Bhim Singh, Raja of Amber. His paternal grandparents were Raja Prithviraj Singh I and his wife Bala Bai, a daughter of Rao Lunkaran of Bikaner. Following the death of Bhim Singh in 1537, the throne of Amber passed to Askaran's elder brother Ratan Singh. One source alleges that Askaran had a hand in his father's death and later went on a pilgrimage to absolve himself of the crime. However, historian Jadunath Sarkar considers this claim of patricide to be unlikely, given that this pilgrimage took place over a decade after Bhim Singh's death. The fact that the source for this information is anonymous and undated further detracts from its credibility. Rule of Amber and granting of Narwar What is more certain is that Askaran had ordered the assassination of his brother Ratan Singh in 1548, instigated by nobles who had been insulted by the latter. But after a reign of only 16 days, Askaran himself was overthrown at the hands of the nobility, the crown instead passing to his paternal uncle Bharmal. Haji Khan, the Mughal governor of Alwar and Mewat, was later able to arrange a reconciliation between Askaran and Bharmal. Further to this, the displaced raja was also recommended to the Mughal emperor Akbar to be granted the rule of Narwar in compensation for his lost kingdom. Narwar remained with Askaran's descendants from then on as a principality independent from the Rajas of Amber. Under Mughal service In 1562, Askaran supported Bharmal when Suja, the son of his other uncle Puranmal, attempted to make a claim for the throne. Later, when Bharmal became a favourite of Akbar, Askaran's own relations with the Emperor rose due to his kinship and close ties with the former. He subsequently joined the Imperial service, coming into the limelight in 1577, when Akbar ordered an expedition against Madhukar Shah Bundela of Orchha. Askaran was given a responsible post on this campaign and upon its success he, alongside the chief commander Sadiq Khan, brought their defeated foe to submit to Akbar at Bhera on 15 May 1578. From there, he accompanied Akbar to the Mughal capital at Fatehpur Sikri and remained with him at Court. The following year, Askaran was among the senior officers who were dispatched to quell an army rebellion in Bihar. He remained in the east, fighting alongside Todar Mal in military campaigns and returning with him to re-join Akbar in Punjab in 1581. Amid administrative reforms in 1583, Askaran was appointed to a committee tasked with overseeing inheritance in regards to property. In March 1585, he was awarded the rank of 1000 zat and directed to assist Mirza Aziz Koka in the governorship of Malwa. On 20 December of that year, he was among the able commanders who joined Zain Khan Koka in a campaign against the Yusufzais. In December 1586, he, alongside Sheikh Ibrahim, were appointed joint governors of Agra. Later, having reached a fairly advanced age, Askaran was retired from active military service and remained at Court. When his son Goverdhan was killed in a family feud in 1593, he was visited by the Emperor to receive his condolences. He died in 1599 while serving as governor of Gwalior Fort. He was succeeded in both this position and as Raja of Narwar by his son Raj Singh. Family Askaran was married to Indravati, a daughter of Rao Maldev of Marwar. He had at least two sons; Goverdhan, who predeceased him, and Raj Singh, who was his successor. His daughter Manrang De married Rao Udai Singh of Marwar who through their own daughter Jagat Gosain, were the maternal grandparents of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.

It may be a sticker or attached by twist tie or other means. Typical price tag with security cuts, for 99¬¢ + tax Some jurisdictions require items (possibly exceptions for bulk good and produce) to be individually marked with the price, or have shelf tags or barcode scanners available so customers can determine prices without consulting store staff. In some cases, unit price is also required. Some jurisdictions also outlaw price discrimination except for different quantities (e.g. quantity discounts are allowed) or different types of customers (e.g. individuals vs. organizations that might be expected to buy in bulk or have better creditworthiness). For example, the 1936 Robinson‚ÄìPatman Act outlaws this practice in the United States. Many price tags also bear the name of the store. History Before the late 19th century, in most cases, retail goods did not have a fixed price, and each customer would be expected to haggle with the store clerk. The Quakers, who found it immoral for different customers to pay different prices (now known as price discrimination) were an exception. In the 1870s, Wanamaker's in Philadelphia and Macy's in New York (Rowland Hussey Macy was a Quaker) began affixing physical tags to items, eliminating haggling. This allowed shorter training time for new clerks (who would no longer need to know the art of haggling nor the range of accepted prices for every item) and allowed clerks to serve more customers. Even large stores kept goods behind a counter, requiring clerks to fetch items for customers. The Piggly Wiggly chain of grocery stores was the first to become self-service in 1916, further cementing the need for price tags. Price tags soon became commonplace in Western retail stores, and haggling rare outside of proprietors and individuals selling used items.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Llano County, Texas in 1980, and designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1981. It has also been known as the Badu House and as the Carol Phelan Building. It is now being operated as a restaurant and private event space under the name of Badu 1891. Designed by Larramour and Watson, the Badu building was erected in 1890 by the Llano Improvement and Furnace Company, as the location of the newly chartered First National Bank. The building is constructed of local granite and locally manufactured red brick. The marble-floored street level with its carved wood interiors were the public access portion of the bank. The second floor was designed for office space. The Llano Improvement and Furnace Company had been organized with the specific purpose of promoting land development in the area, but went bankrupt circa 1894. The building was sold to N. J. Badu in 1898 at a public auction. Until 1980, the building had been continuously owned by members of Badu's family. From 1907 to 1912, the building was leased to the First State Bank of Llano. The Badu family sold it in 1980. It has been used as a bed and breakfast facility, and as a restaurant. N.J. Badu N. J. Badu was a native of Nancy, France. Educated and trained as a geologist in Europe, Badu emigrated from France to Mexico. From there, he traveled to New Orleans, eventually finding employment in Texas as an instructor of the French language, in the Lamar County town of Paris. He married a woman from the same county by the name of Charlie Neal. After a subsequent career change, he gained some experience at hotel management in Dallas and Austin. During his tenure in Paris, Badu had heard much about the geology of Llano. He was hired by the Llano Improvement and Furnace Company to manage the Algona Hotel, the area's grand upscale establishment. When the Llano Improvement and Furnace Company went bankrupt, the Algona closed. Badu became employed as a manager of the Driskill Hotel in Austin, but maintained his home in Llano.

He studied law, and became an officer in the militia before moving to Texas in 1839, where he established a law practice. He was elected to the Texas Congress and served from 1843 to 1844. He supported annexation by the United States, and was elected to the Texas Senate in 1846. At the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War however, he resigned his seat and enlisted in the Texas Mounted Volunteers, fighting in the Battle of Monterrey. He was chosen as a delegate at the Texas State Convention in 1860, and cast his vote to secede from the Union. After secession, he became a captain in the 3rd Texas Cavalry, a unit he helped organize, with his older son Thomas E. Hogg serving in the company as well. Shortly afterwards Captain Hogg was appointed colonel by Texas Governor Edward Clark. On February 12, 1862, he was appointed brigadier general, confirmed a day later, and served in the Army of the West. In April he was given command of a brigade to reinforce Confederate troops at the Siege of Corinth. His brigade consisted of the 10th, 11th and 14th Texas Cavalry regiments (dismounted) as well as Andrews' Texas Infantry, McRay's Arkansas Infantry and Goode's Texas Battery.

The district incorporates the historic village of Linden Hall, which dates from the late 1700s. The resources within the district, which total 33 structures, range in date from 1810 to 1919. The district represents an excellent collection of diverse 19th and early 20th century vernacular dwelling styles representative of small rural villages in central Pennsylvania. Linden Hall is one of the oldest continually inhabited communities in western Penns Valley and closely resembles in its scale and mix of resources, other local villages which evolved around mills established in the early 19th century.National Register of Historic Places, Linden Hall Historic District Registration Form, July 1990. The town originally developed as a mill site along Cedar Run around 1800.National Register of Historic Places, Linden Hall Historic District Registration Form, July 1990. The village expanded northward from the mill site throughout the 19th century. Though never very large, Linden Hall reached its greatest extent around the turn of the century. A train station was added to the village when the railroad was extended through the valley in 1885. Today, the early commercial enterprises are gone, robbing Linden Hall of a central focus and leaving gaps among the homes that remain. Major buildings include the Rock Hill School, the Evangelical Methodist Church and the Irvin residence. Homes are principally Victorian in style and are of frame construction. Although some are only one story in height, most range from two to two-and-a-half stories.Historic Resources of the Centre Region, Centre Regional Planning Commission, 1982  History of the village  The first people known to have settled in Linden Hall was the James Watson family who built a cabin along Cedar Creek sometime prior to 1778. The family left the area as a result of numerous Indian raids which forced many families from the area in the \\"Great Runaway\\" between 1778 and 1788. On their return, they brought with them an Irish immigrant, John Irvin, who later married their Daughter Anne. Irvin prospered and in 1808, built a grist mill at the narrowest spot on Cedar Creek. The mill and farm which Irvin established upstream of the mill site became the nucleus for what was to become the village of Linden Hall. Because of periodic fires, this location was to be occupied by a succession of two more mills until operations ceased in 1928. The mill was removed in 1938. The village may have begun with the Irvin mill and farm, but the village grew in part from the establishment of three other farms and their associated buildings. These were established by John Tressler (1836), Daniel Hess (1857) and John Ross (1870). As these other farms were established during the nineteenth century, Linden Hall became a local service center and soon other homes were built and businesses started in the village. These early commercial enterprises included a cobbler shop operated by George Huss and three stores, two of which still exist in the district but are no longer in operation. Daniel Hess, who established his farm in the area in 1857 and also operated a local store, was instrumental in having the Pennsylvania Rail Road come through Linden Hall. This event initiated a period of economic prosperity which lasted until about the mid-1920s. With rail transportation, it became feasible to commercially exploit stands of white pine and hemlock in the nearby mountains and in 1895, the Linden Hall Lumber Company was formed to log Bear Meadows and the area along Laurel Run in what is currently Rothrock State Forest. With the influx of workers for the nearby lumber mill and the establishment of a coal and lumber business at Linden Hall, a local boom ensued which was reflected by a marked increase in building activity. During the period from 1885-1900, six new homes, a new school, a church, and two new barns were built. The decline in the lumber industry and the rise of the automobile for transportation resulted in less traffic through Linden Hall, and construction declined after 1900. By 1920, passenger service was no longer offered through the village; however, freight rail continued until Hurricane Agnes destroyed portions of the Railroad Right of Way in 1972.National Register of Historic Places, Linden Hall Historic District Registration Form, July 1990.

It had a mixed record in service, and was replaced by the more capable Blue Vixen. Design and development Blue Fox was developed to a Royal Navy requirement for a radar to equip the British Aerospace Sea Harrier FRS.1. Its primary role would be to detect large targets like maritime reconnaissance aircraft or anti-shipping bombers flying over the sea. A secondary role was air-to-surface search and strike against shipping. The system was designed within strict limits of size, time and cost. Ferranti developed the system using components of their Ferranti Seaspray radar, used on the Westland Lynx naval helicopter to detect ships. It emerged as a frequency agile I band radar that weighed less than 85 kilograms in total. Three two-seat Hawker Hunters were also fitted with Blue Fox radars for Royal Navy Sea Harrier pilot training, designated Hunter T.8M. Service history The Blue Fox entered operational service with the Fleet Air Arm in July 1981 when 801 Naval Air Squadron, under the command of Commander Nigel \\"Sharkey\\" Ward, was commissioned and went to sea aboard HMS Invincible.Ward p. 8 Previously, 899 Naval Air Squadron, the Headquarters Training Squadron for the new Sea Harrier and 800 Naval Air Squadron, the first operational unit of the type, had initially flown their aircraft without radar fitted.Ward p.61 Following the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, the British Government dispatched a naval task force to the South Atlantic, including two aircraft carriers, each carrying a Sea Harrier squadron. 801 Squadron was embarked on HMS Invincible and 800 Squadron (now with Blue Fox) on the flagship, HMS Hermes. The leadership of 800 Squadron had experienced difficulties with the Blue Fox radar and took the view that it was useless, discounting Ward's claims that the equipment performed better than Ferranti had predicted.Freedman p. 255 A Ferranti engineer joined the task force at Ascension Islands, primarily to fix a problem with seawater ingress into the radome, but was also able to retune 800 Squadron's radars. However, by that time, confidence in the equipment had been lost and there remained considerable differences in the way it was utilised between the two squadrons throughout the conflict.Ward pp. 172-174 In the course of the war, four Argentinian aircraft were destroyed in air-to-air combat using Blue Fox. As was expected, the radar was unable to \\"look down\\" over land or rough sea and the other interceptions relied on a combination of ships' radars and visual acquisition.Ward p. 210 However, in moderate sea states, the Blue Fox was found to be useful in the surface search mode, being able to detect a warship at a range of 100 nautical miles. On 2 May, a single Sea Harrier was able to detect the Argentinian carrier group as it approached the British task force.Ward pp. 211-214 The Fleet Air Arm's Sea Harrier FRS1 with Blue Fox began to be phased out in 1989 with the introduction of the FA2 version, which was fitted with the more capable Ferranti Blue Vixen radar. The remaining FRS1 aircraft were converted to this standard as the FRS2. An Indian Naval Air Arm Sea Harrier taking off from the flight deck of Indian Navy aircraft carrier INS Viraat in 2007. The Indian Navy acquired Sea Harriers in three batches, the first in 1983. For the second batch, to be delivered in 1989, the Indians sought a radar with a better \\"look down\\" capability, but the successor to the Blue Fox, the Blue Vixen, was still undergoing trials in the United Kingdom and would not be available for export for some years, so Blue Fox was reluctantly accepted.Hiranandani pp. 91-94 The Indian Sea Harriers were eventually upgraded by the replacement of Blue Fox with the Israeli Elta EL/M-2032 radar.

The TN360 uses an air-cooled two-cylinder 354 cc engine with a single overhead camshaft, and was adapted from the Honda CB450 motorcycle. The preceding T360 had been equipped with a very complex twin-cam four-cylinder unit, whereas this new engine (shared with the N360 sedan) was more fitted for mass production. The engine was redesigned to be mounted horizontally, residing midships beneath the load floor. TN360 The TN360 premiered in November 1967 and remained in production unchanged until January 1970.360cc: Light Commercial Truck, p. 91 Top speed is , the same as for its predecessor. Thanks to a simpler construction, weight dropped considerably: from for the old T360 to for the 1967 TN360. Output remained unchanged at 30 PS (22 kW) at 8,000 rpm, but torque increased somewhat to at 5,500 rpm and everything occurred in a lower engine speed range. The engine benefited from engineering efforts achieved on the Honda 1300 four cylinder, air-cooled sedan introduced in 1969. The TN also had a considerably tighter turning circle, at 7.6 metres. The only bodywork available was as a drop-side pickup truck. After only a few months in the market, Honda added a panel van range to the lineup in March 1968, simply a pickup with a permanently covered bed. These were available in four various configurations (with or without sliding side doors, as well as a version with a canvas roof) at a slightly higher price. Due to worse aerodynamics and slightly higher weight, top speed for the panel vans was only , with a max of for the open top version. In 1969, a better equipped DeLuxe version was added to the range. In November 1969 Honda presented an interesting variation of the TN360: the \\"Snowler\\" had removable skis mounted on the front wheels, while the rear wheels were replaced by caterpillar tracks with rubber belts. A similar version of the previous T360 had also been built, and Honda continued to target this very narrow market. The Snowler's top speed was , while weight increased to a sturdy . The price was more than 55% higher than that of a regular TN360, but Honda was alone in offering a vehicle with these sorts of capabilities at such a comparatively low price. The tracks were also removable, so as to make for a useful trucklet in the summer as well. TNIII Honda TNIII The lightly facelifted Honda TNIII went on sale at the end of January 1970. The differences were limited to a larger, chromed grille, chromed bumpers, larger rear view mirrors, and a slightly more comfortable interior - the large \\"H\\" for \\"Honda\\" remained. The gearbox, while remaining a four-speed unit, became fully synchronized: otherwise the TNIII remained unchanged from the TN360. The TNIII was introduced simultaneously with the facelifted NIII360 and LNIII360 Van models. The peculiar Honda Vamos leisure vehicle shared most of its underpinnings with the TNIII. Aside from the facelift, the biggest news was the addition of a Super DeLuxe version (which came equipped with a radio, a cigarette lighter, and white sidewall tires). Total weight for the base model truck crept up to . The Snowler and Panel Van models continued to be available, making for a total of 28 various models. The range grew further in July 1970, when a pickup version with fixed sides and a rear gate (instead of the three-way fold down beds used so far) was added. In April 1971, the engine was upgraded so as to make it more quiet. TN-V Honda TN-V Super DeLuxe The TN-V, presented in June 1972, was the next facelift. The TN-V received new sheetmetal in front, with a big toothy grille and twin, vertically stacked headlights. The oversized \\"H\\" on the front was replaced by \\"Honda\\" lettering. It was a commercial companion to the Honda Life kei truck. It had a lower compression engine, necessary to meet tighter emissions standards, and only had at a considerably less peaky 7,000 rpm. The modified engine was now also able to run on unleaded petrol, thanks to alloy valve guides and seats. Torque figures stayed unchanged and the weight of the base model also remained at . The TN-V also had a standard drivers' seatbelt while the turn signals were now made separate from the rear lights. In August 1973, the TN-V was again modified to meet new safety standard requirements. TN7 In August 1975 the TN7 was presented. The main difference was that the engine could meet the tighter yet 1975 emissions requirements. Visually it was near identical to its predecessor, the changes being limited to bumper rubbing strips and black rather than dark gray plastic trim in places. It was somewhat heavier than the TN-V () due to the emissions equipment. A passenger side seatbelt also became standard fitment, as did a powered window washer. Production came to an end in July 1977, after about 700,000 TN360s had been built, when Honda presented the larger TN Acty. The 545 cc TN Acty belatedly took full advantage of the new larger kei car standards which had taken effect on January 1, 1976. The Acty range retained the \\"TN\\" label until being redesigned in 1988. Incidentally, the TN7 was the last air-cooled car to be produced in Japan.

Known as Madame Placide during the early years of her career, she is considered by some historians as the first trained ballerina to dance in the United States. Early life Suzanne Theodore Vaillande was born in Dole, Jura, France, on September 28, 1778. It is believed that her birth was illegitimate; her mother was Marie Reine Vailland (sic) but her father is unknown.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Suzanne Douvillier\\" Due to a lack of extant records knowledge of her childhood is almost entirely bereft of even the vaguest detail - all that is known is that she was educated in Paris and therefore it has been conjectured that her early ballet training was at the Paris Opera. As she entered her teenage years the French Revolution was underway, and she arrived in Santo Domingo (Saint- Domingue), then part of the French West Indies, around 1790; it was there that she encountered Alexander Placide, primarily a 'theatrical figure' though impressively multitalented, accomplished in such diverse activities as fencing, acrobatics, and the directing of plays. He would become a major professional (and, to some extent, romantic) partner and influence in her career. Career In 1791 the duo moved to America after the Santo Domingo rebellion. Her debut came on January 25, 1792, at the John Street Theatre in New York City, in The Bird Catcher, a piece generally regarded as the first ever ballet performed in New York. She was billed as Madame Placide, though they were unmarried at the time. They remained there for some months, performing many ballets and pantomimes together. For the later part of 1792 they moved to Philadelphia and Boston, then in 1793 to Newport, Rhode Island, where they were joined by Louis Douvillier. In 1794 they moved south to Charleston, South Carolina. By then she was the most popular and talented dancer in America, and in 1796 became the first female choreographer in the United States by choreographing the ballet Echo and Narcissus, at the age of just 18. In June 1796 tensions between Douvillier and Placide came to a head - they had a duel over the affections of Vaillande. Despite the fact that Placide won, Douvillier married Suzanne and in 1799 they settled in New Orleans. She then started choreographing often, though continued dancing. In 1808 she became the first female to perform as a male in America; the opposite was quite widespread, though at the time this act was considered amazingly daring. In 1813 she started set design, and is said to be a pioneering female in this respect also. Later life Her face became disfigured in later years, according to actor Noah Ludlow.Ludlow, Noah, 1880, Dramatic Life as I Found It Her final performance was in Don Juan in 1818; in it, she wore a mask which concealed this. She died in New Orleans in 1826 at the age of 48, outliving her husband by five years. The couple are buried in St. Louis Cemetery, New Orleans. She is seen as a pioneer in both the advancement of women's roles in society and in choreography.

He was the son of a former British vice-consul at Le Mans and was born there, but raised in Jersey. He attended the Kensington School of Art and though he acted in a few West End shows, moved into fashion design. He is associated with the death of the actress Billie Carleton in 1918, and was convicted of supplying drugs to her, but was acquitted of her manslaughter. Early life While an actor in London, de Veulle became involved in a 1911 blackmail trial involving William Cronshaw and John and Rose Powers. The Powers were prosecuted for trying to blackmail Cronshaw by threatening to tell his relatives and directors of his Manchester firm about his relationship with their son, Frederick Powers. It transpired during the court case that Cronshaw had met Frederick Powers through de Veulle, and that he had also given de Veulle large sums of cash. Rose Powers was later acquitted of the blackmail charge.Sexual blackmail: A History. Angus McClean. Pages 125‚Äì126 Via the case notes it appears de Veulle had been travelling and working in America, and while in New York it is said he first developed his cocaine habit. He then arrived in Paris and became a ladies dress designer. With the outbreak of war in 1914, de Veulle travelled back to London and worked for a Mayfair theatrical costumier. In 1915 he met the actress Billie Carleton when she modelled his creations at Miss Phelps of Albermarle Street.The Tragic Case of Billie Carleton He also supplied her with drugs, mainly sourced from a Scottish woman, Ada Lau Ping, and her husband Yu Lau Ping, who lived in Limehouse causeway, east London.http://www.nickelinthemachine.com/2009/10/chinatown-the-death-of- billie-carleton-and-the-brilliant-chang/ In 1916, de Veulle married a Parisian woman, Pauline Gay,GRO Marriages September 1916 Gay De Veulle St. Geo.

De Veulle bought drugs from the Lau Ping's and the actor Lionel Belcher, and supplied his friends and associates. de Veulle also hosted orgies at his Mayfair flat where cocaine and opium (cooked up by Ada Lau Ping) were freely available. These parties were attended by Billie Carleton, Belcher and others.Chinatown, the Death of Billie Carleton and the 'Brilliant' Chang\\". Another Nickel In The Machine. 25 October 2009. Though called up for active service in September 1918, de Veulle's drug addictions led him to be declared unfit for duty. In late November 1918, shortly after the Armistice, a Victory Ball was held at the Royal Albert Hall.\\"What Happened at the Gay Victory Ball: Poisoned by One of her Admirers, Pretty Billie Carleton's Death Has Led to Revelations of London Night Dissipations which Startled All England and Stirred the Police to Clean Up the Plague Spots of the British Capital\\".

Truth. 29 March 1919. Court cases At the inquest into Billie Carleton's death the coroner gave clear directions to the jury regarding de Veulle's guilt in supplying the cocaine that caused her death. Malvina Longfellow was a witness at the inquest and testified about Carleton's addiction. However, it took the jury barely 15 minutes to find de Veulle guilty of manslaughter, and he was taken into custody.Marek Kohn. Dope Girls: The Birth of the British Drug Underground.

When de Veulle's case came to trial, even though the judge gave the jury clear directions to find De Veulle guilty of manslaughter, after 50 minutes of deliberations the jury acquitted him on 4 April.

History The company can trace its history in Doncaster back to 1789. It was formed in 1924 as British Ropes Limited. British Ropes Ltd was headquartered at 32 Cavendish Square. British Ropes was state-owned. From the 1960s to 1980s, British Ropes headquarters was at Warmsworth Hall at Warmsworth, off the A630 near the B6376 junction. In 1974 it became known as Bridon; Bridon was the name of one of their brands of wire rope. In 1976 the company was turning over ¬£243 million. In 1978 the company was registered on the Stock Exchange.

He married twice, the second marriage being to a lady-in-waiting to the Danish Queen. Family His father, Enevold De Falsen (1755‚Äì1808) married Anna Henrikka Petronelle Mathiesen (1762‚Äì1825) in 1781. They had 7 children, including the statesman Christian Magnus Falsen (1782‚Äì1830) and the county governor Carl Valentin de Falsen (1787‚Äì1852). Their fourth child, J√∏rgen Conrad de Falsen was born on 19 August 1785 in Kristiania (now Oslo). Early career De FalsenTops√∏e-Jensen Vol I p 351‚Äì355 joined the Danish-Norwegian navy as a volunteer cadet in 1797, becoming a midshipman in 1798 and acting lieutenant in 1801. Promoted to junior lieutenant in 1802, he served in Friderichssteen on a cruise to the Danish West Indies in 1802‚Äì1803. Returning in poor health, he was granted six months' sick leave‚Äîextended to nine months‚Äîbefore resuming duties and in 1805 returning to the Danish West Indies in the frigate Diane, a voyage followed by another extended period of leave. In April and May 1807 he was first officer on board the frigate Triton, and later in 1807 in charge of troop transports bringing Danish soldiers from Femern to Lollandsee also Munch-Petersen page 211, skilfully navigating the treacherous waters with his vessels thanks to his navigational experience. Later the same year, he was promoted to senior lieutenant. In 1808 and early 1809 he was stationed on the Scheldt, where Danes crewed and officered Pultusk (or Pulstuck) and Dantzick, two French ships-of-the-line.Anderson page 337 When the Danish captains were replaced on 28 January 1809 with French ones, Falsen and fellow officer Senior Lieutenant Frederick Christian HolstenTops√∏e- Jensen Vol I pp 617‚Äì618 resigned in protest and refused to obey orders, so they were arrested and sent to Frederickshavn Citadel to serve a six-month detention. Gunboat War In July 1809 Falsen was posted to a gunboat flotilla in the Great Belt, but in August was ordered from Nyborg to Fladstrand. Whilst travelling to his new post, he injured his knee in a cart accident, so P. M. Tuxen took command at Fladstrand. Falsen's organisation of naval aspects of the abortive 1810 expedition to Anholt in February and March of that year failed due to short notice, winter leave for the gunboat crews, ice and storm; Falsen sought to exonerate himself in a report to the Danish king. After this he was posted to Fladstrand under the command of Lieutenant P. M. Tuxen.Wandell page 262 In an engagement lasting some ninety minutes, Falsen's flotilla of four gunboats exchanged heavy fire with a British frigate of 32 guns on 27 April 1810 off Skagen (The Skaw) before both sides broke off the fight.Wandell page 263‚Äì4 On 12 September 1810 off L√¶s√∏, Falsen captured HMS Alban, which the Danes took into service as The Alban. It was recaptured just seven months later. In early 1811, now the officer commanding Fladstrand and Hals flotilla, the prize money that was owed to him was finally given. During the Battle of Anholt on 23 March 1811, Falsen was in command.Topso√∏- Jensen page 353 The most senior army officer in the attack, Major Melsted, was killed during the battle. The Danes were defeated and Falsen was captured, but he was exchanged on 8 April 1811 during a prisoner exchange and was landed in Jutland. On the 4th of July Falsen's flotilla engaged a British convoy near Hjelm. During the engagement Falsen was wounded in action when captured his vessel, Gunboat No 2. Again, he was exchanged a few days later. In November 1811 Falsen was off sick due to his battle wounds worsening, but on 19 August 1812 he was again involved in an action when he captured the brig HMS Attack off Gren√•. Post-war In the immediate post-war years de Falsen undertook several foreign study tours but his health was poor, and he was given extended leave on health grounds in 1835. He continued to suffer from liver disease and gallstones, but eventually retired as a rear admiral in 1848. Marriage Falsen's first marriage was to Cecilie Catharine Hoier in 1811. She died in 1817, and he married J√∏rgine Elisabeth Rosenkrantz on 9 November 1825. He had two sons, Enevold (1813‚Äì1867) and Niels.

After being sentenced to 57 years in prison for check kiting, Andrus spent only three years in the Louisiana and Texas Department of Corrections and was released in 1994. This started his interest in the criminal justice system. Andrus spends at least 20 weeks out of the year traveling abroad speaking to disadvantaged youth who are children of felons or have parents currently incarcerated in prison. Andrus is the Director of Criminal Justice at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. Andrus received a grant from the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 and 2011 to study \\"Equal Protection of the law in the Era of Terrorism\\" and spent ten weeks in Seattle with two student researchers. Andrus received additional funding for $50,000 from DHS to continue his study in 2011. Andrus was awarded a grant from the Sam Taylor Foundation to track law enforcement killings in the United States in 2014. In 2015 Andrus applied for and was granted acceptance to participate in the Second Chance Pell Initiative through the Department of Education. Andrus was named Executive Director of Wiley College's Second Chance Pell Program which offered degrees to offenders who were incarcerated in prison. Wiley College was one of only three HBCUs granted acceptance into the Second Chance Pell Program during its initial launch. Early life Andrus is a native of Crowley, Louisiana, and is the twelfth child of Alice V. Andrus and Warren Lee Andrus. Andrus grew up during an era when America was undergoing significant change in its political, economic, and racial landscape. He was in the third grade when schools in Louisiana were integrated, and racial assimilation led to very different views among the liberals and conservatives of the time. He grew up in a home that was destroyed by fire when he was in kindergarten. He was active in sports throughout his early life, playing football, baseball and basketball. He was also active in academic clubs in junior high and high school. Education Andrus graduated from Crowley High School in 1981 with honors and attended Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana, US, where he graduated in 2000 with a degree in criminal justice. He later graduated from the University of Louisiana at Monroe in 2001 with a master's degree in criminal justice. On May 7, 2005, Andrus completed his doctorate at Prairie View A&M; University became the first African American in the US to earn a Ph.D. in juvenile justice. Andrus developed the Enviroecogenetics Theory which focuses on environment, economics, and genetics as causes of crime. Andrus is also credited with developing the theory that people who do not have money or anything to lose are predisposed to a greater extent to engage in criminal activity. Andrus' broke theory proposes that people who are living in comfortable settings and earning decent incomes are less likely to engage in criminal activity. Andrus theory aligns with Edwin Sutherland's Differential Association Theory. Andrus also earned his prior learning assessment certificate and his Mastery Certificate from the University of Chicago and the Council On Adult and Experiential Learning. Andrus is also president and CEO of the Council on Higher Educational Solutions For Adults (CHESA). Career Andrus is credited with developing two evolving theories on crime--Enviroecogenetics and Broke Theory--and is the author of three books: Beneath the Skin of Black Folks, From Prisoner to Ph.D., and Why Are So Many Black Folks In Jail? Dr. Andrus is Director of Criminal Justice at Wiley College and President and CEO of the Council On Higher Education Solutions For Adults (CHESA). Dr. Andrus is also President and CEO of Tracy Andrus Foundation. Andrus' Enviroecogenetics theory suggests that criminal activity can be explained by analyzing three dominant variables: * the environments in which individuals are raised, * the economic status of individuals and their families, and * the genetic makeup of individuals and their families. Andrus suggests that individuals who are raised in low socioeconomic environments are predisposed to a greater extent to become engaged in criminal activity. According to Andrus, economics, specifically the lack of money, is the strongest predictor of an individual's likelihood to engage in criminal activity, whilst the reasons can be varied. Andrus was elected president of the Southwestern Association of Criminal Justice in 2008, and is an ordained minister and pastor of Edward Chapel MBC in Marshall, Texas. Andrus was elected vice chair of the Minority and Women Section of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences which is the largest criminal justice conference. Published by Createspace, Why Are So Many Black Folks In Jail? was released in December 2011 and raises questions about the functions of incarceration in the United States. Andrus is an advocate for African Americans and felons in the US. Andrus is also the author of Beneath the Skin of Black Folks, From Prisoner to PhD and a Macro Analysis of Poverty and African American Incarceration.

History =KMYR and KDEN= The station was launched by Frederick W. Meyer, a wholesale grocer, in 1940 as KMYR. (The call sign represented Meyer's name.) It originally signed on with 250 watts of power. The station's sale in 1956 brought a call letter change to KDEN. For a time in the 1970s and 80s, KDEN aired an all-news radio format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1985 page B-43 At first it used NBC Radio's \\"News and Information Service\\" (NIS).

The downfall of Radio AAHS came when the Walt Disney Company established a competitor, Radio Disney. After the sign-off of Radio AAHS in January 1998, Children's Broadcasting Corporation needed programming for its owned & operated former AAHS stations until it could find buyers for them. KKYD, along with the other nine CBC stations, became an outlet for \\"Beat Radio\\", which broadcast electronic dance music 12 hours a night. =Colorado Public Radio= This lasted until late October 1998. KKYD then switched to a Catholic radio format, which it aired until sale from the Catholic Radio Network to Colorado Public Radio. The announcement of CPR's purchase February 9, 2001, also mentioned plans to convert the station from commercial to non-commercial status.http://extras.denverpost.com/scene/radio0209.htm In September 2000, CPR acquired the intellectual properties of then-classical station KVOD AM 1280, as that station was switching to another format. In March 2001, Colorado Public Radio put the classical music programming of KVOD on 90.1 FM, with KCFR's News/Talk/NPR programming moved to 1340 AM. On July 9, 2008, KCFR moved back to 90.1 FM, with KVOD moving to the newly acquired 88.1 FM frequency. The changes were made as CPR wanted to go FM-only by the end of the year. Until a buyer could be found for 1340, CPR continued to operate it as a simulcast of 90.1 KCFR. On October 31, 2011, CPR launched \\"OpenAir\\" on 1340 AM, billing it \\"New Music from Colorado Public Radio.\\" It has a broad-based format that focuses on current independent artists with a great deal of current Colorado talent. OpenAir also streams online at www.openaircpr.org. With the change, new KVOQ call letters were adopted. =Sports radio= On July 24, 2015, Colorado Public Radio announced that it would swap KVOQ to Victor Michael's Cedar Cove Broadcasting, Inc. in exchange for KRKY-FM. Michael also forgave $100,000 in debt as part of the swap. On July 27, 2015, KVOQ changed its format to all-sports, branded as \\"Mile High Sports\\". The previous OpenAir format is now heard on KVOQ 102.3. On August 28, 2015, the station changed its call sign to the current KDCO. Effective January 20, 2016, Cedar Cove Broadcasting traded KDCO to Kona Coast Radio, LLC, in exchange for translator stations K214DW and K206EO. Kona Coast Radio is also owned by Victor Michael. On April 28, 2016, KDCO began simulcasting on FM translator K284CI 104.7 FM Denver.Mile High Sports Returns to FM Radioinsight - April 28, 2016 Effective August 22, 2017, Victor Michael sold KDCO and translators K225BS and K284CI to 4-K's LLLP for $464,000.

The game took place on November 24, 2013, at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field in Regina, Saskatchewan. It was the third Grey Cup game to be hosted in Regina following the 83rd and 91st editions of the game. The Roughriders won their fourth championship with a score of 45 to 23 against the Tiger-Cats.https://www.cfl.ca/article/101st-grey-cup-awarded-to- saskatchewan 101st Grey Cup awarded to Saskatchewan The game took place on artificial turf, and Mosaic Stadium added temporary seating to bring the total seating capacity to just under 45,000. Celebrities Tom Hanks and Martin Short were in attendance. Kick-off occurred at 5:30 p.m. CST (6:30 p.m. EST; 3:30 p.m. PST), while the pre-game started at noon CST (1 p.m. EST; 10 a.m. PST). This was the third consecutive year that the Grey Cup involved a team from the host city, following the BC Lions in the 99th Grey Cup and the Toronto Argonauts in the 100th, with all three games seeing the host win. This was also the fourth time that the Roughriders and Tiger-Cats met in the Grey Cup final, having previously met in the 55th, 60th, and 77th editions of the game. The Roughriders became the second western-based CFL team to win the Grey Cup at their home stadium. Roughriders running back Kory Sheets was named the Most Valuable Player after setting a Grey Cup record by rushing for 197 yards and scoring two touchdowns. Slotback Chris Getzlaf, also of the Roughriders, was awarded the Dick Suderman Trophy as the Most Valuable Canadian. Host city On September 29, 2011, news agencies reported that the game would be awarded to Regina, Saskatchewan. On October 13, 2011, it was officially announced by the Canadian Football League that the city of Regina would host the game. It was the third time that Regina hosted the event, following the 1995 and 2003 games. It was announced on February 24, 2012 that Mosaic Stadium would be undergoing a series of renovations and upgrades to increase capacity to host the Grey Cup. The Saskatchewan Roughriders spent $14 million to increase seating capacity to approximately 45,000 by adding temporary seats in the end zones. Corporate boxes, concessions and washroom facilities were also added to accommodate the increased number of fans at the stadium. A new 60-foot wide digital LED screen and scoreboard was installed in the northeast end zone while another new 55-foot wide digital LED screen and scoreboard was attached to the west grandstand. The Grey Cup Committee announced the details of the 101st Grey Cup on November 29, 2012. Festivities Numerous festivities within Regina and throughout Saskatchewan were held as part of the Grey Cup celebrations. The festivities were officially named the \\"Celebration in Rider Nation\\" by the host Roughriders. The 101st Grey Cup Festival opened on Wednesday with its opening ceremonies and ran up until kick-off, while including such traditional events as the Grey Cup parade on Saturday and the team-based parties on Friday. The festival also featured concerts by several popular Canadian bands, including the Barenaked Ladies and Hedley, who performed during the game at halftime. Elsewhere in the province, organizers held a Riderville North celebration in Saskatoon. Aside from a viewing party of the game, the event also featured interactive games, tributes to the Riders and musical performances, including one by The Sheepdogs the night before the game. Path to the Grey Cup =Hamilton Tiger-Cats= The Hamilton Tiger- Cats played the season at Alumni Stadium in Guelph, Ontario due to the demolition of their home stadium, Ivor Wynne Stadium, and the building of its replacement, Tim Hortons Field. They finished the season with a record of 10‚Äì8 and finished second in the East Division. In the playoffs, they defeated Montreal 19‚Äì16 in the East semi-final, then travelled to Toronto where they won the East final, 36‚Äì24. =Saskatchewan Roughriders= The Saskatchewan Roughriders had an 11‚Äì7 record, which placed them second in the West Division. In the playoffs, they defeated BC 29‚Äì25 in the West semi-final, then travelled to Calgary where they won the West final, 35‚Äì13. =Head-to-head= Hamilton and Saskatchewan met twice during the regular season with the Roughriders winning both games. The first meeting between the two was in Regina on July 21, with the Riders dominating the Tiger-Cats in a 37‚Äì0 win. The following week, July 27, the two teams met again in a rematch, this time with the Tiger- Cats as the home team. The Riders would win that game as well, with a final score of 32‚Äì20. Game summary As the designated visiting team, Hamilton called heads for the coin toss. With the toss turning up tails, Saskatchewan deferred their choice to the second half. Hamilton chose to receive the ball to open the game and Saskatchewan chose to defend the south end zone, giving Hamilton the notable wind at their backs and the ball to open the game. Hamilton head coach Kent Austin never used the scramble offence (that the Hamilton Tiger-Cats often used with great results in their two East Division playoff games, deploying backup quarterback Dan LeFevour and occasionally even number three quarterback Jeremiah Masoli to run the scramble offence, temporarily leaving starting quarterback Henry Burris on the sidelines) on even a single play in the entire Grey Cup game. Saskatchewan quarterback Darian Durant started the game off poorly, fumbling the ball twice during Saskatchewan's first two offensive drives of the game, with the first being self-recovered and the second being caught by Saskatchewan running back Kory Sheets and carried for a 39-yard gain. Hamilton opened the scoring early in the first with a field goal by Luca Congi, but Saskatchewan quickly responded with a touchdown pass from Durant to Geroy Simon to make it 7‚Äì3 for the Roughriders at the end of the first.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/grey-cup-101-underway- in-regina/article15578648/ Saskatchewan opened the second quarter with a field goal to make it 10‚Äì3, and Saskatchewan running back Jock Sanders scored a touchdown to put the Roughriders up 17‚Äì3. Following a turnover by Hamilton quarterback Henry Burris, who missed a snap and allowed the football to shoot past him, Sheets scored his first touchdown for Saskatchewan to extend their lead to 24‚Äì3. While Hamilton would score another field goal before the end of the quarter, a 42-yard pass from Durant to Simon at the end of the quarter put the Riders up 31‚Äì6 at half-time. The 24-point performance by the Saskatchewan offence ranks as one of the best single-quarter performances in Grey Cup history. The third quarter opened with neither team able to sustain a meaningful drive until near the end of the quarter, when Burris ran the ball 18 yards for Hamilton's first touchdown of the game. That would turn out to be the only score of the quarter, although Hamilton scored a field goal in the first play of the fourth quarter to make it 31‚Äì16 for the Roughriders with fifteen minutes left to play. However, Hamilton was unable to translate its momentum into another touchdown, and with five minutes remaining in the game Kory Sheets scored another touchdown for the Roughriders to extend the Riders' lead to 38‚Äì16. Saskatchewan forced a turnover on the following Tiger-Cats' possession which quickly led to a touchdown by Weston Dressler to make the score 45‚Äì16. The Tiger-Cats would close the scoring with a touchdown by C.J. Gable, but it proved to be too little as the Roughriders allowed the clock to run down and won the game with a final score of 45‚Äì23. =Scoring summary= First Quarter :HAM ‚Äì FG Congi 45 (9:44) 3‚Äì0 HAM :SSK ‚Äì TD Simon 15 yd pass from Durant (Milo convert) (6:59) 7‚Äì3 SSK Second Quarter :SSK ‚Äì FG Milo 20 (12:46) 10‚Äì3 SSK :SSK ‚Äì TD Sanders 3 yd running (Milo convert) (9:00) 17‚Äì3 SSK :SSK ‚Äì TD Sheets 1 yd running (Milo convert) (5:31) 24‚Äì3 SSK :HAM ‚Äì FG Congi 24 (2:47) 24‚Äì6 SSK :SSK ‚Äì TD Simon 42 yd pass from Durant (Milo convert) (1:56) 31‚Äì6 SSK Third Quarter :HAM ‚Äì TD Burris 18 yd running (Congi convert) (2:52) 31‚Äì13 SSK Fourth Quarter :HAM ‚Äì FG Congi 33 (14:48) 31‚Äì16 SSK :SSK ‚Äì TD Sheets 4 yd running (Milo convert) (5:23) 38‚Äì16 SSK :SSK ‚Äì TD Dressler 26 yd pass from Durant (Milo convert) (4:09) 45‚Äì16 SSK :HAM ‚Äì TD Gable 2 yd running (Congi convert) (1:56) 45‚Äì23 SSK Musical acts Like the 100th edition, the 101st Grey Cup featured an all- star lineup of Canadian musical acts. The opening ceremonies of the game were marked by a performance by the Saskatoon-based group The Sheepdogs, who played two songs, while the national anthem was performed by Ontarian singer Serena Ryder. The half-time show was sponsored by Sirius XM and featured the rock band Hedley in a 13-minute compilation performance of Hands Up, Anything, Invincible and Cha-Ching, which included several stunts by a performer on a snowmobile. Television and radio In Canada, the English broadcast was presented on TSN, while the French language broadcast was handled by its sister station, broadcast in Canada by RDS. In the United States, the game was broadcast on the NBC Sports Network (NBCSN, simulcasting the TSN feed). On the radio, the game was covered by TSN Radio, AM900 CHML, CKRM and Sirius XM.http://cfl.ca/article/101st-grey-cup-to-be-broadcast-on-tsn-rds-nbc-sports- network 101st Grey Cup to be broadcast on TSN, RDS, NBC Sports Network Overall, the game was seen by 11.5 million viewers, or approximately 1 in 3 Canadians, with an average viewership of 4.5 million. Celebration In the immediate aftermath of the game, thousands of fans poured into the streets of Regina to celebrate. The Saskatchewan Roughriders held a Grey Cup parade on November 26 that started from Mosaic Stadium, travelled south down Albert Street, and ended at the Legislative Building, where a short ceremony occurred.

It is one of 2,000 manor houses in the region and was specially restored to house a collection of international contemporary art that explores the crane, a bird that stops on the West Pomeranian plains every spring and autumn on its migratory flight from northern Europe to Spain and North Africa. Works The new museum features sixteen permanent works curated by Khadija Carroll La and Alex Schweder La across six large galleries. The Museum is directed by Bettina Klein. \\"A Guide to Empathy: In III Parts\\" by Emma Waltraud Howes and Kai Meyer is a piece that involves performance, costume, and video, of mimetic attempts to fly. \\"Faltungen\\" is a sound installation by Andy Graydon that tells the story of the folding of a thousand paper cranes.An interview with artist, Andy Graydon, Kranich Museum. Composer Tamara Friebel's \\"I love you\\" is a mini loudspeaker and video installation which stages the dance of the brolga (Australian cranes). Ward Shelley's \\"Cranes Timeline\\" is a diagrammatic drawing depicting the evolutionary path of cranes, from the emergence on land of the amniotic egg, through the age of dinosaurs to modern birds. Alex Schweder La's \\"Waiting for the cranes\\" is centered around a small field of corn planted for migrating cranes. This field is the same size as the room from which a visitor waits for the arrival of the crane. Likely never to appear, the work is about the gap between desire and gratification. The duo Hadley and Maxwell paint \\"Maybe it is They who Watch Us\\", drawing on examples of various decorative styles that are a part of the building's history in various forms: as graffiti, in a mural, as a repeated pattern, and in a specially designed Toile de Jouy that pictorially tells a story of the museum itself. The fiction of the museum is affirmed in Khadija Carroll La's installation, which features Grus vigilans, a collection of stones from famous crane commentators, Aristotle, Chuang Tzu, and Virgil through to the likes of the brothers Grimm, Werner Herzog, and local collectors. An artist in residence program housed in the former coach house beside the manor will host writers and visual artists throughout the winter, who will respond to the museum's themes. The building The museum includes twelve rooms, a library, lecture room, gift shop, caf√© and Alte Schmiede restaurant. Layers of history are revealed in the restoration, which establishes a continuum from nineteenth century manor, to East German social housing in the post-war period, to the present. The wall text designed especially for the building and tuckpointed into its walls with a mixture of crane bone, ink, and mortar evoke the poetic in history. History The museum building was renovated by a team of artists and builders in response to the existing architectural elements. The history of the Hessenburg estate goes back to the beginnings of the settlement of the region. Documented in the late 13th century as a fortress with moat belonging to the knight Antonius von dem Bughe, the village appears again in 1696, when the Swedish conquerors documented it in detail as Schlechtem√ºhl, renamed in 1840 after the new owners von Hesse who built a late classical manor house and Neo-baroque landscape garden including ancient trees. Today, buildings such as the 250-year-old smithy, seasonal farmer's house, inspector's house with school, stables that were in use until 1990, and an old ice house all remain on the site. A library of historical videos are available to view in the salon. Curator, Carroll La is quoted as saying: ‚ÄúThe museum is in the vein of Museums Insel Homboerch or La Fundaci√≥n Chinati, the Hessenburg estate and park offers an experience of art and architecture that responds to its powerful natural setting. It is also comparable to Paris‚Äôs , the exhibition is complementary to the natural history of the crane.‚Äù The Kranich Museum is sponsored by 2011.

Career In 1896, Aylwen began work as a clerk at stockbrokers J & A Scrimgeour, eventually rising to senior partner by 1948, the year he became Lord Mayor. Shortly after beginning his career, he was sent to Africa during the Boer War with the Royal Fusiliers. He earned the Queen's Medal with four clasps. Despite being blinded in one eye, he returned to serve with the Royal Fusiliers during the First World War. He was treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1937. Girling Ball ‚Äì dean of the hospital from 1930 to 1945 ‚Äì recorded in his diary in 1939 that Aylen treated the clinical staff like children. Aylwen was initially concerned about plans for the development of a National Health Service in the 1940s, worried that it would impede the freedom of the voluntary hospitals and, though he came to support the plans, he used his position as chair of the Voluntary Hospitals Committee for London to ask for existing hospital boards to be kept on. =Lord Mayor of London= After a term as one of the two sheriffs of the City of London in 1946‚Äì7, he was elected Lord Mayor of London on 29 September 1948, to succeed Sir Frederick Wells, and took office on 9 November. Less than a week later, he was the second person to be officially notified of the birth of Charles, Prince of Wales on 14 November, after the Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede, who had to be officially notified himself as the centuries-old tradition that the Home Secretary be present in person for a royal birth was abolished. In 1949, at the Savoy Hotel he toasted Danny Kaye with \\"I'd like to see every meeting of ministers preceded by a little turn of Danny Kaye. That might even have an effect on Mr. Vyshinsky of the Soviet Union\\". The toast and Kaye's response, beginning \\"I think emotions are the same the world over\\", were covered in the papers in both the UK and the US, a fact ridiculed by Life magazine. At the Lord Mayor's Show on 9 November 1949, when he was being taken to the swearing- in of his successor, Sir Frederick Rowland, the two horses leading his coach bolted into the crowd, hospitalizing around a dozen people. He completed the journey in Sir Frederick's coach instead. Honours Aylwen became a knight bachelor of the United Kingdom in the 1942 New Year Honours. He was made a hereditary (to male heirs only) baronet \\"of Saint Bartholomew's in the City of London\\" on 25 November 1949. The new baronetcy became extinct upon his death in 1967. Personal life He had two daughters, Marjorie, born 1906, and Margaret, born 1909, and two grandchildren, Michael Lampson, born 1936, and David Lampson, born 1939.He divorced his first wife, Edith Eliza Caroline Hill, in 1951 and married playwright Elena Ingraa Bulgarides. In 1963, he and his wife, Lady Aylwen, employed Archibald Hall (alias Roy Fontaine) as their butler after he impersonated his own employer when Lady Aylwen called to take references. Hall claimed to have stolen jewellery from the Aylwens' guests and to have been seduced by Lady Aylwen. Hall was convicted of four murders in the 1970s, including that of MP Walter Scott-Elliot, and died in prison in 2002.

Engelmann was Professor Emeritus of Education at the University of Oregon and Director of the National Institute for Direct Instruction.Carnine, D. & Silbert, J. Siegfried Engelmann. Encyclopedia of Behavior Modification and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Sage Publications. http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/cbt/n3057.xml He wrote more than 100 curricula using DI principles and numerous other books and articles.Barbash, S. (2012). Clear Teaching: With Direct Instruction, Siegfried Engelmann Discovered a Better Way of Teaching. Education Consumers Foundation. Biography Siegfried Engelmann was born November 26, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois. After graduating with class honors in philosophy from the University of Illinois in 1955, he spent time in a variety of occupations, from working in exploratory oil drilling to being a science editor. While working as a marketing director in the early 1960s, Engelmann became interested with how children learn. This interest began with examining how much exposure was required for a young child to learn a motto or an advertising theme and what effects reinforcing presentations would have on learning rates. He began working with preschoolers, including his own children, focusing first on topics related to advertising and then on more academic content. In 1964, he left his job in advertising and became a research associate at the Institute for Research on Exceptional Children at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, working with Carl Bereiter. In 1970, he moved from the University of Illinois to the University of Oregon in Eugene, becoming a Professor in the University's College of Education. =The Theory of Instruction= In addition to developing curriculum, Engelmann wrote 19 books as well as scholarly articles and other reports of his experiments on teaching and learning. In a book called The Theory of Instruction, Engelmann and Douglas Carnine summarized the theoretical basis of the Direct Instruction approach. They analyzed three components of cognitive learning: behavior, communication, and knowledge systems.Engelmann, S.E. & Carnine, D. (1982). Theory of instruction: Principles and applications. New York: Irvington Publishers. They proposed that the mechanism by which humans learn involves two attributes. First, they postulated that individuals can learn any quality, defined as an irreducible feature, from examples. People are limited in this ability only by their sensory capabilities. The second attribute involves how learning occurs, and involves the notion of generalizing from examples. Learners have the capacity to develop ‚Äúrules‚Äù or ‚Äúunderstandings‚Äù about common qualities to a set of examples. As soon as learners are presented with information, they begin to formulate such rules. This is done by noting what is equivalent or ‚Äúsame‚Äù about the various examples that are given. Once the learner has determined what is the same about the examples of the concept or quality, generalization occurs. =The Bereiter-Engelmann Preschool= At the University of Illinois, Bereiter had a grant to accelerate the development of young children, and Engelmann worked with him on that project. In the summer of 1964, they opened a program for \\"culturally disadvantaged\\" preschoolers, which became known as the Bereiter-Engelmann Preschool. Their goal was to demonstrate the extent to which disadvantaged children could accelerate their learning beyond the performance of middle class students and thus have a better chance of success in school. At the preschool, Engelmann trained other teachers to work with the children. Engelmann developed scripted lessons that provided the exact wording for teachers to use,Clowes (June 2001). \\"If the children aren't learning, we're not teaching.\\" School Reform News. http://arthuracademy.org/home/engelmann-interview.html sequenced the learning in the most effective manner, and provided guidelines for checking children's responses and providing appropriate corrections and reinforcements. The scripts allowed teachers to focus on their interaction with the children. = Tests of Direct Instruction efficacy = Engelmann authored more than 100 curricular programs based on the principles that were discovered in the Bereiter-Engelmann Preschool. The first programs, written from 1968 through 1970, were called DISTAR, for Direct Instruction System for Teaching and Remediation, and were designed to teach reading, math, and language to children in kindergarten through second grade. The DISTAR materials were used in some locations that participated in Project Follow Through, the largest educational experiment in the history of the United States. Follow Through, which was sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education, began in 1968 and continued into the 1970s. The project targeted primary school children in communities with high levels of poverty. The DISTAR materials demonstrated the highest gains in the study.Watkins CL, \\"Project Follow Through,\\" Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies (1997). http://www.behavior.org/resources/901.pdf In subsequent years, the original DISTAR programs were expanded from the original three levels to include six levels. These programs are currently called Reading Mastery and Connecting Math Concepts. Engelmann also developed a multilevel reading program for students beyond the primary level, including adults, who performed lower than others (Corrective Reading Decoding and Corrective Reading Comprehension), programs to teach writing and spelling (Reasoning and Writing and Spelling Mastery), and a videodisc series to teach math and science to middle school students (including Chemistry and Energy and Elementary Earth Science). Programs were also written for parents to use with their children, such as Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy LessonsKenter (Jan 11, 2013). The readers' writers: Educator, author and professor Siegfried Engelmann. Booneville Daily News. and Give your Child a Superior Mind. Engelmann also developed computer-based programs for parents and others to teach young children reading and math skills (Funnix Beginning Reading and Funnix Beginning Math), as well as programs to teach English speaking skills to non- native English speakers at third grade or older (Direct Instruction Spoken English). =\\"The Pet Goat\\"= \\"The Pet Goat\\" is a reading exercise from the 1995 children's workbook Reading Mastery II: Storybook 1 by Siegfried Engelmann and Elaine C.

Booker School in Sarasota, Florida, when he was informed of the ongoing terror attacks.  Honors and awards  In 1984, Engelmann received an honorary doctorate from the Psychology Department of Western Michigan University. In 1994, he received the Fred S. Keller Award from the American Psychological Association‚Äôs Division of Experimental Analysis of Behavior. In 2000, the journal Remedial and Special Education named him as one of the 54 most influential people in the history of special education; and, in 2002, the Council of Scientific Society Presidents, awarded him the 2002 Award of Achievement in Education Research.

The street originally formed a link between the King's Garden (Rosenborg Castle Gardens) and the Queen's Garden. With the Odd Fellows Mansion on Bredgade and the central pavilions of the east fringe of the castle garden located at each their end, the street has axial qualities. These are accentuated by the Dronningeg√•rden Estate, a Functionalist housing complex from the 1940s, which forms an urban space around the intersection with Adelgade. History A map from 1710 showing the still relatively undeveloped New Copenhagen area with the large King's Garden and smaller Queen's Garden, connected by Dronningens Tv√¶rgade Dronningens Tv√¶rgade in c. 18230s Dronningens Tv√¶rgade in the 1900s Dronningens Tv√¶rgade originates in the 1649 plan for New Copenhagen, the large area which was included in the fortified city when the old East Rampart along present day Gothersgade was decommissioned and a new one was built in a more northerly direction. According to the plan, the streets in the area were to be named after Danish territorial possessions, royalty and the upper classes. Dronningens Tv√¶rgade, the Queen's Cross Street, was named after Queen Sophie Amalie, the consort of King Frederick III who had ascended the throne in 1648, and provided a direct connection between the King's Garden at Rosenborg and the future Queen's Garden at Sophie Amalienborg. In the middle of the 18th century the eastern end of the street became part of Frederiksstaden while the western end passed through the neighbourhood around Borgergade and Adelgade which came to suffer from overpopulation and poverty and gradually fell into despair before it was demolished in the 1940s to make way for modern dwellings. Buildings Moltke's Mansion on the corner of Bredgade The oldest building on the street is currently known as Moltke's Mansion and takes its name from Adam Wilhelm Moltke who acquired it in 1852. It was, however, originally built for Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl√∏ve and was in that time known as Gyldenl√∏ve's Little Mansion. It was designed by Ernst Brandenburger and built between 1700 and 1702. No. 26 dates from before 1734. The Dronningeg√•rden Estate, which was designed by Kay Fisker and built from 1943 to 1958, defines a distinctive urban space along the street.

The discipline is relatively new, but offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society.  History  Donna Haraway‚Äôs 1984 \\"\\"A Cyborg Manifesto\\" was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg. A sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled \\"Cyborg Anthropology\\", which cites Haraway's \\"Manifesto\\". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology. The sub-group was closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science.Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001 More recently, Amber Case has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public. She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology. Many academics have helped develop cyborg anthropology, and many more who haven't heard the term still are today conducting research that may be considered cyborg anthropology, particularly research regarding technologically advanced prosthetics and how they can influence an individual's life. A 2014 summary of holistic American anthropology intersections with cyborg concepts (whether explicit or not) by Joshua Wells explained how the information-rich and culture-laden ways in which humans imagine, construct, and use tools may extend the cyborg concept through the human evolutionary lineage. Amber Case generally tells people that the actual number of self-described cyborg anthropologists is \\"about seven\\". The Cyborg Anthropology Wiki, overseen by Case, aims to make the discipline as accessible as possible, even to people who do not have a background in anthropology.  Methodology  Cyborg anthropology uses traditional methods of anthropological research like ethnography and participant observation, accompanied by statistics, historical research, and interviews. By nature it is a multidisciplinary study; cyborg anthropology can include aspects of Science and Technology Studies, cybernetics, feminist theory, and more. It primarily focuses on how people use discourse about science and technology in order to make these meaningful in their lives. = 'Cyborg' origins and meaning = The word Cyborg was originally coined in a 1960 paper about space exploration, the term is short for cybernetic organism.\\"Cyborgs and Space,\\" in Astronautics (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like pacemakers, insulin pumps, and bionic limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state. In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology. Haraway's \\"Cyborg Manifesto\\" suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She goes on to say that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg. = Digital vs. cyborg anthropology = Digital anthropology is concerned with how digital advances are changing how people live their lives, as well as consequent changes to how anthropologists do ethnography and to a lesser extent how digital technology can be used to represent and undertake research. Cyborg anthropology also looks at disciplines like genetics and nanotechnology, which are not strictly digital. Cybernetics/informatics covers the range of cyborg advances better than the label digital.  Key concepts and research  = Actor‚Äìnetwork theory = Questions of subjectivity, agency, actors, and structures have always been of interest in social and cultural anthropology. In cyborg anthropology the question of what type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture (Silicon Valley), government sanctions (net neutrality), specific innovative humans (Steve Jobs), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. Actor-network theory (ANT), proposed by Bruno Latour, is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another. ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology. Similarly, Wells explain how new forms of networked political expression such as the Pirate Party movement and free and open-source software philosophies are generated from human reliance on information technologies in all walks of life. = Artificial intelligence = Researchers like Kathleen Richardson have conducted ethnographic research on the humans who build and interact with artificial intelligence. Recently, Stuart Geiger, a PhD student at University of California, Berkeley suggested that robots may be capable of creating a culture of their own, which researchers could study with ethnographic methods. Anthropologists react to Geiger with skepticism because, according to Geiger, they believe that culture is specific to living creatures and ethnography limited to human subjects. = Posthumanism = The most basic definition of anthropology is the study of humans. However, cyborgs, by definition, describe something that is not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the study of humans may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a posthuman condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans. Sociologist of technology Zeynep Tufekci argues that any symbolic expression of ourselves, even the most ancient cave painting, can be considered \\"posthuman\\" because it exists outside of our physical bodies. To her, this means that the human and the \\"posthuman\\" have always existed alongside one another, and anthropology has always concerned itself with the posthuman as well as the human. Neil L. Whitehead and Michael Welsch point out that the concern that posthumanism will decenter the human in anthropology ignores the discipline's long history of engaging with the unhuman (like spirits and demons that humans believe in) and the culturally \\"subhuman\\" (like marginalized groups within a society). Contrarily, Wells, taking a deep-time perspective, points out the ways that tool-centric and technologically communicated values and ethics typify the human condition, and that cross-cultural and ethnological trends in conceptions of lifeways, power dynamics, and definitions of humanity often incorporate information-rich technological symbology.

He grew up in Stockholm. Sigurd Wallin was the son of the Swedish artist David Wallin (1876-1957) and his wife Elin Wallin (1884-1969), born Lundberg, Stockholm. He was the brother of the artist Bianca Wallin (1909-2006). His uncle was the Swedish-American artist Carl E. Wallin (1879-1968). In 1945 he married Margit, born Ruuth, the couple settled down in Stockholm, Sweden, and had two daughters. The landscape around Arild, where it was especially strong summer light, was a popular motif for the artist Sigurd Wallin, here a view over the fishing port in Arild. To find motifs for his oil paintings Sigurd Wallin made annual summer trips, most often to Scania, especially to the neighbourhood of Arild, M√∂lle and B√•stad. Arild was originally an old fishing village, known as Arildsl√§ge (Arild‚Äôs fishing village). On Kullaberg in Arild the artists could benefit from an especially strong summer light that reminded of that of Skagen light, and many Swedish artists were therefore active in Arild and Kullabygden. M√∂lle is on Kullen (Kullen peninsula) at the foot of Kullaberg. From the beginning the function of M√∂lle was as a fishing village, as was also the function in Arild. B√•stad is the largest urban village in the area of Bj√§rehalv√∂n (Bj√§re peninsula) and it is located at Hallands√•sen with lively summer tourists who put their stamp on the place. B√•stad has the largest outdoor facilities for tennis in the Nordic countries. B√•stad is also known for its beaches and the resort was once known as a spa and there are still several guesthouses. In this region of Scania Sigurd Wallin found many fine motifs for his oil paintings. Biography Alvastra Monastery, ruins of the monastery. In the 1530s the monastery was demolished and it was never rebuilt. Sigurd Wallin grew up in Kungsholmen in Stockholm. In 1928, when Sigurd was about 12 years old the family moved to √ñstermalm in Stockholm. He graduated from Sigtunaskolan a Swedish boarding school located in Sigtuna, Sweden,Sigtunaskolan Humanistiska L√§roverket, SSHL, was founded by Manfred Bj√∂rkquist and Harry Cullberg. The first buildings of what eventually became SSHL were constructed in 1900-1933. Until 1980 Sigtuna housed two schools, Sigtunaskolan (SS) and Sigtunastiftelsen Humanistiska L√§roverket (SHL), located on hills on either side of town. In 1980 the two schools were consolidated at the SHL site on the western side of town. in the spring of 1935. After that he practiced in the architect profession, among other places at the architect office of architect Albin Stark in Stockholm during the years 1937-1939.Albin Stark (1885-1960) was a Swedish architect, who was trained as an architect at the Tekniska H√∂gskolan i Stockholm (the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Albin Stark started in 1909 together with Josef √ñstlihn an own architectural firm, √ñstlihn & Stark. During the 1910s it was a very productive architectural office in Stockholm. In the 1930s Albin Stark worked in the functionalism architecture. He was also interested in archaeology and he participated in the excavations in the vicinity of Alvastra, Alvastra Abbey and the settlement of Alvastra. Alvastra is a small village, next to Omberg, near √ñdesh√∂g in √ñsterg√∂tland in eastern Sweden. It is known for being the seat of the Cistercian Alvastra Abbey in the Middle Ages. In the 1530s the monastery was demolished and it was never rebuilt. The preparation was done by students in art history and in archaeology and also by workers under the led by Otto Fr√∂din (1881-1953), or some other experienced archaeologist. The Alvastra monastery ruin is today well preserved and a popular place to visit.Otto Fr√∂din (1881-1953) was a Swedish archaeologist who worked with both ancient and medieval times. Fr√∂din became a student in Uppsala in 1899 and Ph.D. in 1919. In 1905 he became pro tempore official at Statens historiska museum in Stockholm and in 1911 curator and director of the museum‚Äôs department of Stone Age and Bronze Age. Between 1921 and 1955 the largest and most extensive excavations of Alvastra Monastery took place, at first with the led by Otto Fr√∂din and after his death in 1953 by Ingrid Swartling. After the Swedish Lutheran reformation in the 1530s, the monastery was demolished and it was never rebuilt.Alvastra Monastery by Riksantikvarie√§mbetet, history in English. However Wallins interest in art, which he had received in his parents‚Äô home, led him to begin to draw and to paint portraits. Wallin followed the teaching at times at Edvin Ollers painting school (Edvind Ollers school of painting) in Stockholm 1940-1944. Edvin Ollers (1888-1959) was a designer, an artist and a qualified art teacher and had studied at the Konstindustriskolan in Stockholm. During the summer Edvin Ollers led a school of painting on the Swedish West Coast on the island Gullholmen in Bohusl√§n in Orust outside Lysekil, on the artists Gullholmen. Gullholmen was originally one of the oldest fishing villages in Sweden. Sigurd Wallin painted from models at Otte Sk√∂lds m√•larskola (Otte Sk√∂ld school of painting) in Stockholm. When Otte Sk√∂ld (1894-1958) returned to Sweden from Paris in 1929 he founded Otte Sk√∂ld school of painting together with √Öke Pernby (1901-1981). In the 1940s Otte Sk√∂ld Studio, as it was known in a prospectus, was situated in Snickarbacken 7 in Stockholm. Otte Sk√∂ld, who was a Swedish artist, draftsman and printmaker, had a central place in Stockholm‚Äôs cultural life during the 1940s and 1950s. He pursued art education during much of his life. In Paris in the 1920s he ran together with Danish and Norvegian colleagues Acad√©mie Scandinave. The school was arranged as a pure art school after the classic pattern by teaching daytime and evening. The school functioned as a \\"nursery\\" for further study at the art academy and quickly gained a good reputation. Along with Isaac Gr√ºnewalds m√•larskola (Isaac Gr√ºnewald school of painting) it could offer the most significant basic education for its time. After √Öke Pernby‚Äôs studies in Paris, in progress since 1923, he began as a caretaker or superintendent at the Acad√©mie Scandinave in Paris. There he became friend with Otte Sk√∂ld who ran the school of painting. The two friends planned to break up from Paris. They agreed that whoever first came back to Sweden would locate a suitable studio to start a school of painting. The year was 1929 and then the 27-year-old √Öke Pernby was first home. It was the beginning of Otte Sk√∂lds m√•larskola (Otte Sk√∂ld school of painting). High over the ridge in an old mansion in the penthouse at Snickarbacken 7 in Stockholm he found just the \\"Parisian\\" environment he sought.Vem var √Öke Pernby Who was √Öke Pernby? (Swedish) Twenty years later, in 1949, the management was overtaken of √Öke Pernby and the name was changed to the present, Pernbys m√•larskola (Pernby school of painting). When Otte Sk√∂ld became head of Nationalmuseum in 1949, √Öke Pernby continued to run the school in his own name, during the years 1949-1976. Otte Sk√∂ld was also a professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1938-1942, and director of the department in 1941-1950. Otte Sk√∂ld was then curator of Nationalmuseum in 1950-1958.Pernbys m√•larskola Pernby school of painting (Swedish)Isaac Gr√ºnewald (1889-1946) was a professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1932-1942 and from 1941 he ran a separate school of painting, Isaac Gr√ºnewald m√•larskola (Isaac Gr√ºnewald school of painting), in his studio at Slussen in Stockholm.PDF-fil om Otte Sk√∂lds m√•larskola/Pernbys m√•larskola - en liten historik Pernbys m√•larskola - en liten historik, Narvatryck, Stockholm 2001. Sigurd Walllin was also a student of his father, David Wallin. He made several trips abroad for art studies, he visited Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Norway. Sigurd Wallin painted in oil, landscapes, cityscapes, figurative compositions and occasionally still life. He liked to paint landscapes, often with ocean. His paintings have a romantic appropriation and preferably a slightly veiled coloring, which tied in with his father‚Äôs view of an artist. Wallin also conducted a large number of drawings, mostly portraits. He also devoted himself to preservation for the future and to carry out certain artwork conservation-restoration. That required a good touch and a good insight into the artworks, which should be repaired, and special skills were necessary for the practical application. Above all Sigurd Wallin worked in portrait painting, where he with technical skill realized the traditional demands for the genre for likeness. Among the portrait paintings there are: * Portrait of Gerhard T√∂rnqvist (1894-1963), (1961). Gerhard T√∂rnqvist was a Swedish business economist, corporate economist and professor at Stockholm School of Economics, Stockholm, Stockholm School of Economics.

History The Catalina Foothills School District opened its doors in 1931 with nine students and a teacher, who met in a garage. In 1939, developer John Murphey sold 2.2 acres on River Road to CFSD for the sum of ten dollars, with the stipulation that the land be used for a public school. That summer, a two-room country schoolhouse was designed by Joseph T. Joesler and built by the Works Progress Administration. Originally known as the River Road School, the building is now the Murphey Administration Center. In 1993, the district went before the U.S. Supreme Court to argue that it did not have to provide an American Sign Language interpreter to a deaf student who transferred to a private, parochial school Salpointe Catholic High School. The district argued that, while the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act would normally require such services if the student attended public school, providing it for religious instruction would be unconstitutional. In Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, the court found \\"that the Establishment Clause does not bar the school district from providing the requested interpreter.\\" but also did not rule that the district is required to provide an interpreter.

The Ridgeley is fine-grained, siliceous, calcareous in its lower strata, sometimes fossiliferous, and sometimes locally pebbly or conglomeritic. Varying in thickness from 12 to 500 feet (4‚Äì150 m), this rock slowly erodes into white quartz sand that often washes or blows away, but sometimes accumulates at large outcrops. When freshly broken, the rock is white, but outcrop surfaces are often stained yellowish by iron oxides. The Ridgeley SandstoneOriginally spelled \\"Ridgely\\" but changed to \\"Ridgeley\\" to conform to usage by the U.S. Postal Service. was described and named in 1913 from an outcrop in Ridgeley, West Virginia, across the North Branch of the Potomac River from Cumberland, Maryland. The type locality was designated at the town of Ridgely (spelling later changed to Ridgeley) in Mineral County, West Virginia.Schuchert, C., Swartz, C.K., Maynard, T.P., and Rowe, R.B., 1913, The Lower Devonian deposits of Maryland, in: Lower Devonian - Text (C.K. Swartz, C. Schuchert, and C.S. Prosser, eds.), Maryland Geological Survey, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, p. 67-132 During the early 20th century, there was some dispute about relation between the Ridgeley Sandstone and the Oriskany Sandstone (named after a locality in New York) and the Monterey Sandstone (named after a locality in Virginia). This dispute was resolved by Butts (1940), who stated that the Oriskany Sandstone \\"corresponds exactly with the Ridgley Sandstone,\\" that the Oriskany Sandstone is the same as the Monterey Sandstone of Virginia, and that the rules of stratigraphic nomenclature dictate that the name Oriskany Sandstone should be applied to these strata.Butts, C., 1940, Geology of the Appalachian Valley in Virginia: Virginia Geological Survey Bulletin 52, pt. 1, 568p. Outcrops of the erosion- resistant, ridge-forming Ridgeley (\\"Oriskany\\") sandstone are conspicuous landscape features in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province from south- central Pennsylvania through western Maryland and eastern West Virginia to Craig County in western Virginia. Ridgely outcrops form part of the lateral structures of North Fork Mountain, New Creek Mountain, and Wills Mountain of the Wills Mountain Anticline, although it is the even more erosion-resistant Silurian-aged Tuscarora Quartzite, not the Ridgely sandstone, that caps most parts of the prominent central ridge of this long geological structure. Other conspicuous Ridgeley outcrops include Caudy's Castle (Castle Rock) and Ice Mountain, both in Hampshire County, West Virginia. At Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, warm water flows from natural mineral springs in the Ridgeley sandstone of Warm Springs Ridge; spa facilities (now in Berkeley Springs State Park) have long used these waters. The Ridgeley sandstone is sometimes quarried and crushed to produce quartz sand for glass-making; one such quarry is near Berkeley Springs.

Written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and directed by co-executive producer Bradley Buecker, it first aired on Fox in the United States on November 8, 2011. The episode features the preparations for performing West Side Story and the show's opening night, and the various events leading to the decisions by two of the show's student couples‚ÄîRachel (Lea Michele) and Finn (Cory Monteith), and Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss)‚Äîto begin having sex. While an advanced copy of the episode was released to several reviewers and was highly praised by them, the reviewers of the broadcast were not as generally enthusiastic. In particular, some of the plotting and resulting characterization came in for criticism. The performance of \\"America\\", however, was widely acclaimed, especially that of Santana (Naya Rivera) in the role of Anita. While the advance publicity about the \\"first time\\" events drew some pre-broadcast condemnation, many critics were enthusiastic about the fact that a gay couple was being given such a storyline. All six songs were released in five singles, available for download. Of these, \\"Uptown Girl\\", a song sung by the returning Dalton Academy Warblers, charted on the Billboard Hot 100, and also on the Canadian Hot 100. The remaining songs, all from West Side Story, did not chart. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 6.91 million American viewers, the lowest of the season, and garnered a 3.1/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership for this episode was down somewhat from the previous episode, \\"Pot o' Gold\\", though ratings were fractionally higher. Plot Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) has taken charge of directing the school musical, West Side Story, and he tells the two leads‚ÄîRachel (Lea Michele), playing Maria, and Blaine (Darren Criss), playing Tony‚Äîthat they are not conveying enough emotion in their rendition of \\"Tonight\\". He questions whether they can convincingly portray the roles if they are still virgins. Later, his co-director Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) confesses to him that she is attracted to football recruiter Cooter Menkins (Eric Bruskotter), who is at McKinley to scout potential players for Ohio State, though she is sure he would never consider her. Artie thinks otherwise, and acting on his advice, Cooter arranges a date with her. Blaine and Kurt (Chris Colfer) discuss their decision to postpone sex. Blaine goes to Dalton Academy to invite the Warblers to see him in West Side Story and arrives as they are performing \\"Uptown Girl\\". Afterward, new Warbler Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin) makes a play for Blaine, intercut with Santana (Naya Rivera) and Rachel singing \\"A Boy Like That\\" from the musical. They later meet at a coffee shop, and Kurt arrives as Blaine is telling Sebastian that he already has a boyfriend. Sebastian convinces them to go with him to the local gay bar and supplies fake IDs. While Blaine and Sebastian are dancing, Kurt is surprised to see Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), who has transferred to another school. When Blaine and Kurt leave, Blaine is drunk and aroused, and urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car; Kurt refuses, and Blaine angrily walks home. Rachel lets Finn (Cory Monteith) know that she is interested in having sex with him, but he balks when she admits her reason is to be a better Maria. Later, she asks advice from the other girls in the show. While Santana and Quinn (Dianna Agron) both urge her not to have sex with Finn, Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) reveals that she and Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) had sex over the summer and says how wonderful it was with the boy she loved‚Äîher words are intercut with Rachel and Santana singing \\"I Have a Love\\" in rehearsal. Mike's father (Keong Sim) confronts him about his participation in the musical, and Mike tells him he wants to be a professional dancer, not a doctor. His father angrily disowns him. Cooter recruits Shane (LaMarcus Tinker) for Ohio State, but not Finn, who is despondent about his future. Rachel comforts him, and promises that she will help him find a new future. Back at school, Blaine apologizes to Kurt for getting drunk, and says he cares nothing for Sebastian. Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night. On opening night, Artie is assailed by self-doubt, but he is thanked by the cast for his leadership, and he thanks them for trusting him. They perform \\"America\\", which gets a standing ovation. Blaine and Rachel, waiting to go on and still virgins, are afraid they will not convey the necessary emotion, but Rachel reminds Blaine that they both have found their soulmates in Finn and Kurt, just like Maria and Tony had with each other. As they sing \\"One Hand, One Heart\\" on stage, they are also shown in scenes involving their first sexual encounters with their true soulmates. Production The episode began filming on September 23, 2011, and ended on October 14, 2011. The last nine days were shot in parallel with the sixth episode, which began shooting on October 6, 2011, and briefly with the seventh episode, which began shooting on October 13, 2011. Grant Gustin makes his first appearance in this episode, playing a new \\"major\\" recurring character, Sebastian Smythe, a \\"gay Dalton Academy Warbler who sets his sights on Blaine\\". Gustin won the role after \\"an exhaustive, weeks-long casting search\\", and the character is referred to as \\"promiscuous\\" and \\"scheming\\". Gustin's first day on the Glee set was September 26, 2011. He had been playing the role of Baby John in the touring company of Broadway revival of West Side Story since it opened on September 30, 2010, and left the show after performing on September 23, 2011 to return for his first day with Glee. Although the Dalton Academy Warblers also return in this episode, they are not voiced by the Tufts Beelzebubs, who sang backgrounds for Warblers numbers in the second season. According to Curt Mega, who sings lead on the Warblers track in this episode, the backgrounds were sung by \\"Jon Hall, Brock Baker and Luke Edgemon and some others\\", with the three named men having played on-screen Warblers in the second season. Some of the actors who played Warblers in the second season, including Hall and Mega, returned for the third. After the Warblers were filmed on October 3, 2011, Dominic Barnes, who played Trent in season two, tweeted to Gustin, \\"very impressive moves today sir\\", to which Gustin replied, \\"Thanks bro! Fun stuff!!\\" Another \\"major recurring role\\" debuts in this episode: Eric Bruskotter joins the cast as Cooter Menkins, \\"a football recruiter who comes scouting for talent at McKinley, but finds he can‚Äôt take his eyes off the team‚Äôs gruff but big-hearted coach.\\" Other recurring guest stars that appear in the episode include football coach Shannon Beiste (Jones), the focus of Cooter's eyes, former prom king Dave Karofsky (Adler), exchange student and new glee club member Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), and Mike's parents Julia Chang and Mike Chang, Sr. (Tamlyn Tomita and Sim). This episode features six covers, five of which are from West Side Story, the stage musical being rehearsed and performed during the course of the episode: \\"A Boy Like That\\" and \\"I Have a Love\\" sung by Rivera and Michele, \\"Tonight\\" and \\"One Hand, One Heart\\" sung by Michele and Criss, and the number performed by the Sharks and Jets, \\"America\\". The sixth cover, \\"Uptown Girl\\", is sung by the Dalton Academy Warblers, with Mega on lead vocal. Reception =Ratings= \\"The First Time\\" was first broadcast on November 8, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.1/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 6.91 million American viewers during its initial airing, the lowest number of viewers for a new episode in the third season. While the show's viewership was down by over 7% from the 7.47 million for previous new episode, \\"Pot o' Gold\\", which was broadcast on November 1, 2011, the rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic increased slightly from the 3.0/8 rating/share received by that episode. Viewership also decreased in other countries, and hit season lows in the United Kingdom and Australia as well. In the United Kingdom, \\"The First Time\\" was watched on Sky1 by 973,000 viewers, down 7% compared to \\"Pot o' Gold\\" the previous week, when 1.05 million viewers were watching.UK viewership data: *\\"The First Time\\": *\\"Pot o' Gold\\": In Australia, \\"The First Time\\" was watched by 660,000 viewers, which made Glee the fourteenth most- watched program of the night. The viewership was down almost 9% from \\"Pot o' Gold\\", which was seen by 724,000 viewers.Australian viewership data: *\\"The First Time\\": *\\"Pot o' Gold\\": In Canada, however, viewership was up slightly and 1.66 million viewers watched the episode, which made it the fifteenth most-viewed show of the week, up three slots and over 2% from the 1.62 million viewers who watched \\"Pot o' Gold\\" the week before.Canadian viewership data: *\\"The First Time\\": *\\"Pot o' Gold\\": =Pre-broadcast reception= Like \\"Asian F\\" before it, screener copies of this episode were sent to a number of critics before the show aired. Michael Ausiello of TVLine called it \\"stellar\\" and a \\"standout episode\\", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack wrote that it was \\"one of Glee best installments ever\\" and an \\"exceptional episode\\". Both articles headlined the sexual theme of the episode, and made prominent mention of the fact that both couples would be \\"having sex for the first time\\". Prior to broadcast, Colfer anticipated that the episode's sexual themes and content would prove controversial among television watchdog groups. He said, \\"I absolutely expect to hear from them, but I think it's handled very sweetly and very emotionally. They're expecting this big, raunchy, suggestive, brainwashing storyline when, really, it's very sweet.\\" Before the episode aired, the conservative Parents Television Council called the show \\"reprehensible\\" and the Fox network reckless for \\"celebrating teen sex\\". =Critical reception= When the show aired, the reviewers were not as uniformly enthusiastic as the screeners. Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle called this \\"one of the better episodes in the show‚Äôs three-season run, though not as good as 'Asian F. Time James Poniewozik weighted them differently, calling \\"The First Time\\" the \\"best episode, overall, of Glee season three\\". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal said it had \\"tasteful restraint, subtle playfulness and smoothly woven storylines\\", and The Atlantic Kevin Fallon said the episode \\"treats its characters realistically and send an important message\\". Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" grade of 7.5 out of 10. Rolling Stone Erica Futterman wrote that it was \\"clinical and awkward\\", and the \\"second flatline\\" episode in a row, though she complimented the four actors playing the two couples as \\"genuine and relatable\\". John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that the episode infuriated him \\"on a grand scale\\". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode was \\"far more nuanced, gentle-hearted and romantic than it sounds‚Äîmuch more about love than about sex\\", and a number of reviewers agreed, including AOLTV Crystal Bell. For Hankinson, however, \\"the teenage lust was played a touch too safe, a bit too romanticized\\". Canning said that Kurt and Blaine's \\"attempts to get a little wild\\", and \\"trying to grow up faster than they should\\", were \\"the better parts of the episode as they felt the most realistic\\". Futterman praised their departure from the bar as a \\"very faithful and honest scene\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club and Kubicek both had issues with Blaine's characterization. The latter asserted that he \\"just behaves however the writers need him to behave in order for the scene to work\\", while the former said that Blaine's season three storyline \\"hasn‚Äôt been bad by any means, but it does feel like Darren Criss is playing someone who‚Äôs quite a bit different from the guy he was playing last season\\". Bell was impressed by the way the characters' relationship \\"inspires gay youth in a way that we haven't seen on network television yet\\" and called them \\"amazing role models for all teens\\", and Fallon said it was \\"remarkable\\" and a \\"milestone\\" that \\"the decision by gay teen characters to lose their virginities is given equal weight to that of a straight couple\\". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times characterized the scene with Kurt and Karofsky as \\"subtle\\" and \\"a home run\\", and Entertainment Weekly Abby West called it a \\"perfect little nuanced scene\\", while Ausiello said it was his \\"favorite scene of the episode\\". Poniewozik complimented the way \\"Monteith really sold Finn‚Äôs feeling of being helpless and overmatched\\", and Canning said that Finn's reaction to Rachel's admission that she wanted to have sex because of the play was a \\"solid and true moment\\". Rachel's reasoning, however, came in for harsh criticism: Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was \\"neither believable nor even amusing\\" that she would try intercourse for such a reason, Bell called her a \\"dunce\\", and VanDerWerff didn't believe that she would just blurt it out to Finn. The Star- Ledger Vicki Hyman felt her decision to go all the way did not \\"ring quite true\\", and Poniewozik called it \\"essentially pity sex\\". Ausiello had a different view‚Äî\\"I would hardly call it pity sex\\"‚Äîand West said she was \\"going to choose to believe\\" that Rachel did not have her first time \\"just to make him feel better\\". Several of Artie's scenes came in for criticism. The scene where he advised Rachel and Blaine to have sex was viewed by Poniewozik as \\"a forced conflict designed to drive the plot\\" and highly implausible for a number of reasons. Kubicek stated that \\"acting is about pretending, and if Rachel is really a great actress, she'd be able to play the emotion without needing to have sex\\". Bell and West made similar points. Rae Votta of Billboard commented on the \\"weird\\" plotline that involved Artie and Coach Beiste, for which Kubicek called Artie's actions \\"inappropriate\\". While Hyman \\"liked Artie coming into his own as a director\\", she called his pre-show jitters \\"jarring\\", though she called his final speech \\"a nice moment\\", and Benigno characterized it as \\"a kind of cheesy but actually appropriate speech\\". Futterman felt it was a \\"valid and heartwarming point\\", but \\"awkwardly slotted in\\". Poniewozik credited Jones as Coach Beiste with \\"stunning work\\", and Kubicek said Beiste's \\"fragile lack of self-esteem\\" was \\"believable and heartfelt\\" and that Jones was \\"brilliant\\". The scene where Mike is disowned by his father was characterized as \\"weird\\" and \\"tonally off\\" by VanDerWerff and \\"abrupt and unlikely\\" by Hyman. Kubicek was even more critical: \\"the most over-the-top, terribly clich√©d scene ever\\". However, Votta gave \\"kudos to Glee for sticking with Mike's story this season as he figures out his path\\", and West wrote that Shum \\"played it well\\", while Canning said it and the later scene with his mother \\"were mighty effective, if a bit stereotypical\\". Hyman and West also approved of the latter scene. Sue's absence from the episode was applauded by Bell, who called it \\"exactly what the show needed\\". Michael Slezak of TVLine said \\"the show might be at its best\\" when Sue and Will \\"are relegated to benchwarmer status\\", and Poniewozik \\"did not miss them one bit\\". The new Warbler, Sebastian, was said to be \\"instantly loathsome\\" by Benigno. His scene with Blaine that was blended with Santana and Rachel singing \\"A Boy Like That\\" was variously described as \\"savvily intercut\\" by Hyman, \\"heavy-handed\\" by Votta, and bringing \\"the dangers of teen love\\" to \\"ferocious life\\" by Slezak. Of the ending, Futterman noted that \\"the final scenes actually wound up truthful to these characters\\", and Kevin Sullivan of MTV wrote that \\"when the two separate moments finally did arrive at the end of the episode, it felt like the natural end and was quite touching\\". =Music and performances= Supervising Music Editor David Klotz received a Best Sound Editing: Short Form Musical in Television nomination at the 2012 Golden Reel Awards for his work on the episode. The musical performances were generally well received by reviewers, though a few songs came in for some criticism. One that was given near-universal plaudits was \\"America\\", from Hankinson's \\"awesome\\" to Hyman's \\"killer rendition\\" to VanDerWerff's \\"one of the best production numbers the show has ever done\\". The most frequent caveat seemed to be the accents used by the singers; Flandez thought they \\"could've used a little finesse\\", and Futterman characterized them as \\"questionable\\", though both complimented the performance's dance moves. Santana's performance in the number and the show came in for particular comment: The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called her \\"completely captivating as Anita\\", and Rae Votta of Billboard mentioned her \\"two stand out vocal performances\\". Of the four other songs from West Side Story, \\"Tonight\\" was given an \\"A‚àí\\" and called \\"pretty wonderful\\" by Benigno, while Futterman thought it \\"very sweet, yet very vanilla\\" and West gave it a \\"B\\" and noted it \\"was lacking something\\". Slezak gave the musical's songs a collective grade of \\"A\\". Although others praised Santana as Anita, Futterman was not impressed with her rendition of \\"A Boy Like That\\" and wrote, \\"Santana's part of the song is not nearly angry or urgent enough and sounds like a watered-down version of what Santana is capable of\\". West gave the song a \\"B+\\", and stated that the song was \\"stellar for Rachel's fire\\". Futterman singled out Rachel for \\"I Have a Love\\": \\"Rachel delivers the best vocals of the night with her powerful, yet incredibly high soprano that sounds effortless despite being out of her normal range.\\" Benigno and West both gave \\"One Hand, One Heart\\" an \\"A\\"; the former called it \\"wonderful\\", although he railed about the prevalence of show tunes in the episode, and the latter wrote, \\"This was the perfect soundtrack to the trio of first times.\\" The one song that did not come from the musical was \\"Uptown Girl\\". Votta said the performance by the Dalton Academy Warblers, with \\"leads by minor Warbler Nick, played by Curt Mega\\", was \\"refreshing and nostalgic all at once, a bright pop musical spot in an episode devoted to Broadway and a reminder of the dominant Dalton presence last season\\". Bell wrote that the \\"Warblers were totally born to sing 'Uptown Girl, and Goldberg called it \\"among the young season‚Äôs best\\" performances. Flandez said it was a \\"terrific performance\\", though Benigno was more restrained, and gave it a \\"B+\\" despite there being \\"less innovation\\" in the a cappella \\"gimmick\\", and noted that \\"the barbershop-quartet finish is actually pretty good\\". Slezak, however, said the song was the only musical \\"weak link\\" in the episode, and Canning called it \\"too polished\\". Futterman thought the lead singers were \\"grating and over-the-top\\", and Poniewozik characterized the performance as \\"unfortunate\\". =Chart history= One of the six cover versions released as five singles‚Äîthe \\"A Boy Like That\\" single also contained \\"I Have a Love\\"‚Äîdebuted on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Uptown Girl\\" debuted at number sixty-eight.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Uptown Girl\\" It also debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 at number eighty-three. The other singles, all from West Side Story, did not chart. Two of these singles, \\"Uptown Girl\\" and \\"Tonight\\", are included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 7.

Roll on the bottom right. Oluf Nicolai Roll (25 October 1818 ‚Äì 12 November 1906) was a Norwegian engineer, architect and politician. He was responsible for the industrial development of the area around the river Akerselva in Christiania, and served as Director General of Statens Havnevesen from 1861 to 1896. Personal life Roll was born in Trondhjem, the son of Jacob Roll (1783‚Äì1870) and Emilie Pihl (1797‚Äì1822). He was a maternal grandnephew of Abraham Pihl. On the paternal side he was a half-brother of Ferdinand Nicolai Roll, Karl Jacob Roll and Selma Roll,Genealogical entry for Jacob Roll Through them he was an uncle of Karl Roll and Arthur and Jacob Roll Knagenhjelm. In May 1847 in Aker he married Hanna Christine Schou (1825‚Äì1867), a daughter of brewer Christian Schou and sister of Halvor Schou. They adopted the engineer Thomas Pihlfeldt. Career Roll finished his secondary education in 1938, and then studied at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania, at the Polytechnische Hochschule in Hannover, and at the √âcole des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris.

He was a board member from 1845 to 1868. He contributed by designing all the buildings for the first spinning mill (1845‚Äì1847), and also at a later expansion in 1856 and the construction of a weaving mill in 1864. Nydalens Compagnie developed into the largest textile company in Norway from the 1890s. Roll has been called \\"Norway's first civil engineer\\", and also \\"a sort of a godfather to industrialism in Christiania\\".

Since those early beginnings, poker has grown to become an extremely popular pastime throughout the world.  19th century  Officers of the 114th Pennsylvania Infantry playing cards in front of tents. Petersburg, Virginia, August 1864In the 1837 edition of Foster's Complete Hoyle, R. F. Foster wrote: \\"the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of As-Nas.\\" By the 1990s some gaming historians including David Parlett started to challenge the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas. There is evidence that a game called poque, a French game similar to poker, was played around the region where poker is said to have originated. The name of the game likely descended from the Irish Poca (Pron. Pokah) ('Pocket') or even the French poque, which descended from the German pochen ('to brag as a bluff' lit. 'to knock'). Yet it is not clear whether the origins of poker itself lie with the games bearing those names. It is commonly regarded as sharing ancestry with the Renaissance game of primero and the French brelan. The English game brag (earlier bragg) clearly descended from brelan and incorporated bluffing (though the concept was known in other games by that time). It is quite possible that all of these earlier games influenced the development of poker as it exists now. A modern school of thought rejects these ancestries,Reuven and Gabrielle Brenner, and Aaron Brown, A World of Chance: Betting on Religion, Games, Wall Street, Cambridge University Press (2008), as they focus on the card play in poker, which is trivial and could have been derived from any number of games or made up on general cardplay principles.Stephen Longstreet, Win or Lose: A Social History of Gambling in America , Bobbs-Merrill (1977), The unique features of poker have to do with the betting, and do not appear in any known older game. In this view poker originated much later, in the early or mid-18th century, and spread throughout the Mississippi River region by 1800. It was played in a variety of forms, with 52 cards, and included both straight poker and stud. 20 card poker was a variant for two players (it is a common English practice to reduce the deck in card games when there are fewer players).Aaron Brown, The Poker Face of Wall Street, John Wiley & Sons (2006), The development of poker is linked to the historical movement that also saw the invention of commercial gambling.David G. Schwartz, Roll the Bones: The History of Gambling, Gotham (2007), Timothy O'Brien, Bad Bet : The Inside Story of the Glamour, Glitz, and Danger of America's Gambling Industry, Crown Business (1998), English actor Joseph Cowell reported that the game was played in New Orleans in 1829, with a deck of 20 cards, and four players betting on which player's hand was the most valuable. Jonathan H. Green's book, An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling (G. B. Zieber, Philadelphia, 1843), described the spread of the game from there to the rest of the country by Mississippi riverboats, on which gambling was a common pastime. As it spread north along the Mississippi River and to the West during the gold rush, it is thought to have become a part of the frontier pioneer ethos. Soon after this spread, the full 52-card French deck was used and the flush was introduced. The draw was added prior to 1850 (when it was first mentioned in print in a handbook of games).Henry G. Bond (ed.), Bohn's New Handbook of Games, Henry F. Anners (1850) During the American Civil War, many additions were made including stud poker (the five- card variant), and the straight. Further American developments followed, such as the wild card (around 1875), lowball and split-pot poker (around 1900), and community card poker games (around 1925). =Early books discussing poker= *Hildreth, J.

Modern tournament play became popular in American casinos after the World Series of Poker began, in 1970. Notable champions from these early WSOP tournaments include Johnny Moss, Amarillo Slim, Bobby Baldwin, Doyle Brunson, and Puggy Pearson. Later in the 1970s, the first serious poker strategy books appeared, notably Super/System by Doyle Brunson () and Caro's Book of Poker Tells by Mike Caro (), followed later by The Theory of Poker by David Sklansky (). By the 1980s, poker was being depicted in popular culture as a commonplace recreational activity. For example, it was featured in at least 10 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation as a weekly event of the senior staff of the fictional ship's crew. Two significant events in the late 1980s led to the first poker \\"boom\\". In 1987, California legalized the flop games of hold'em and Omaha, as well as stud. Previously only draw games were allowed. While there were more poker games in California than anywhere else before this, the number of games and the action hold'em brought both increased dramatically. Cavernous poker rooms like the Commerce Casino and the Bicycle Club began operating in the LA area. In 1988 Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), which legalized casino games on Indian lands. Poker rooms began rapidly opening within a few short years. Limit Texas hold'em was the most widely played game by far in the west, and seven card stud was the most widely played game in the east from the late 1980s until 2003. In the 1990s, poker and casino gambling spread across the United States, most notably to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1998, Planet Poker dealt the first real money online poker game. In 1999, Late Night Poker debuted on British television.  21st century  Poker's popularity experienced an unprecedented spike at the beginning of the 21st century, largely because of the introduction of online poker and hole-card cameras, which turned the game into a spectator sport. Not only could viewers now follow the action and drama of the game on television, they could also play the game in the comfort of their own home. Broadcasts of poker tournaments such as the World Series of Poker and World Poker Tour brought in huge audiences for cable and satellite TV distributors. Because of the increased coverage of poker events, poker pros became celebrities, with poker fans all over the world entering into tournaments for the chance to compete with them. Television coverage also added an important new dimension to the poker professional's game, as any given hand could now be aired later, revealing information not only to the other players at the table, but to anyone who cared to view the broadcast. Following the surge in popularity, new poker tours soon emerged, including the World Poker Tour and European Poker Tour, both televised, and the latter sponsored by online poker company PokerStars. Subsequent tours have since been created by PokerStars, such as Latin American Poker Tour and Asia Pacific Poker Tour, as well as other national tours. Beginning in 2003, major poker tournament fields grew dramatically, in part because of the growing popularity of online satellite- qualifier tournaments where the prize is an entry into a major tournament. The 2003 and 2004 World Series of Poker champions, Chris Moneymaker and Greg Raymer, respectively, won their seats to the main event by winning online satellites. In 2009 the International Federation of Poker was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland, becoming the official governing body for poker and promoting the game as a mind sport. In 2011 it announced plans for two new events: The Nations Cup, a duplicate poker team event, to be staged on the London Eye on the banks of the River Thames and \\"The Table\\", the invitation- only IFP World Championship, featuring roughly 130 of the world's best poker players, in an event to find the 2011 official \\"World Champion\\". After the passage of the UIGEA in October 2006, attendance at live tournaments as well as participation in live and online cash games initially slowed; however, they are still growing and far more popular today than they were before 2003. The growth and popularity of poker can be seen in the WSOP which had a record 7,319 entrants to the 2010 main event. The only nations in Europe that prohibit live poker are Norway, Poland and Albania, according to Dagbladet in 2011.

Started by Jules Timerman, with its origins in a food-buying group in West Mt. Airy, Weavers Way is named after the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, a group of weavers and other artisans in Rochdale, England, who, in 1844, got together to purchase food. They developed the Rochdale Principles, a list of operating principles governing their organization. This list formed the basis for what are now known as the International Cooperative Principles. Weavers Way, starting with a small storefront in Philadelphia's West Mt. Airy neighborhood, has grown, in 2018, to nearly 10,000 member households, with annual sales of nearly $30 million, in three locations ‚Äî West Mt. Airy and Chestnut Hill in Philadelphia, and the Montgomery County borough of Ambler. Weavers Way's first major expansion came in 2010, when it added a second grocery store in Chestnut Hill, at 8424 Germantown Ave., at the former Caruso's grocery store site. The Ambler store, at 217 E. Butler Ave., opened in October 2017, and is the Co- op's largest location. The original location, expanded to include several other adjacent buildings, remains in West Mt. Airy, featuring stand-alone specialty pet-supply and health-and-wellness stores. The Co-op rents warehouse space in the SHARE food pantry complex in the Nicetown neighborhood. Two farm operations comprise 6.5 acres, one at Awbury Arboretum in Germantown and one on the grounds of Saul Agricultural High School in Roxborough. Weavers Way publishes a monthly newspaper, The Shuttle, which is mailed to members and available free at the stores. Both the Shuttle and Weavers Way's social networking outlets promote community events and publicize neighborhood issues. Membership and shopping Weavers Way stores are open to everyone, and membership is not necessary to shop there. Membership is available to anyone; an equity investment of $30 a year, to a maximum of $400, is required, and members may vote in board elections and on Weavers Way matters and run for the board. Members receive special prices on some goods and services, as well as other benefits, like discounts at many area businesses. Although completing work hours was also required of all members in the past, it is now optional. Working members in good standing get an additional discount on all of their purchases. Members who are over 65 or low-income are eligible for additional discounts through the Senior Tuesday and Food For All programs. Urban Farms The Mort Brooks Farm was Weavers Way's first farm, an urban intensive organic plot a few miles from Weavers Way at Awbury Arboretum in Germantown. Named after a member who was instrumental to the Co-op‚Äôs early success, the farm was founded in 2000, in large part due to the efforts of Mort's widow, Norma Brooks.Packel, Dan. Weaver's Way Co-op Enjoys the Sweet Sounds of Success. Philadelphia Weekly.' 19 June 2009. In 2007, Weavers Way moved to transform the mostly volunteer-run farm into a market farm with two locations, the second the Henry Got Crops Farm at WB Saul Agricultural High School in Roxborough. Weavers Way has a full-time farm manager and several seasonal farmers, plus apprentices and interns. Hundreds of students come through the farm's education programs each year. In addition, the Saul farm is the site of the Weavers Way-founded Henry Got Compost composting operation. Food Moxie The nonprofit Food Moxie, founded by Weavers Way members as Weavers Way Community Programs (WWCP), partners with schools to teach students about farming, health and nutrition, in programs that include tours of the Weavers Way Farms. In addition to programs at Mort Brooks Memorial Farm at Awbury Arboretum and the Henry Got Crops farm at Saul Agricultural High School, Food Moxie runs the Hope Garden at Stenton Family Manor, a shelter for homeless families in Germantown, and Hope Farm, program for students with intellectual disabilities at Martin Luther King High School in Germantown. History Originally created as a neighborhood buying club, Weavers Way was originally based on a very informal organizational structure, but soon incorporated with a more formal structure, with a board, bylaws and committees. With success, expansion soon became an issue. Throughout the 1980s, Weavers Way considered a number of locations. In 1989, Weavers Way purchased 551 Carpenter Lane (now the site of Big Blue Marble Bookstore), for use as office space and the Co- op‚Äôs first pet-supply store. In 1991, Weavers Way purchased 557 Carpenter Lane. Renovations completed in 1993 joined the two buildings, doubling the size of the main store. Before long, growing membership and increased sales created pressures to expand once again. In 2002, Weavers Way purchased 608 and 610 Carpenter Lane with the intention of opening a prepared foods take-out store and sit-down caf√©. As plans for this expansion progressed, the revelation of a financial crisis redirected the Co-op‚Äôs energies inward to solidify the organization. (The financial crisis of 2002-2003 nearly bankrupted Weavers Way as it was revealed that the bookkeeper had been concealing that Weavers Way had been losing money. Criminal charges against the bookkeeper were later settled, and there was no evidence that the bookkeeper had taken any money or benefited personally.) By 2004, the Co-op emerged a stronger organization, with new management and new accounting and financial controls. In 2005 Weavers Way purchased 555 Carpenter Lane and converted it to offices and meeting space. In 2006, the Co-op hired its first full-time farmer to expand the Awbury garden to a market production farm. As the farm took off, and with the growth of the Co-op‚Äôs educational programs, Weavers Way Community Programs (now Food Moxie) was formed in 2007 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. As membership continued to surge, it became clear that Weavers Way was more than ready to undertake some form of expansion. While the search continued for a second main location, Weavers Way opened a smaller satellite store in 2008 in West Oak Lane, offering fresh, healthy and locally grown foods at 2129 72nd Ave., just off Ogontz Avenue, a major thoroughfare. In September, 2011, citing continuing losses, Weavers Way transferred ownership of the West Oak Lane store to the Ogontz Avenue Revitalization Corp.(OARC). In February 2009, Weavers Way settled on a site for a second main store ‚Äî the former Caruso‚Äôs Market at 8424 Germantown Ave. in Chestnut Hill. After more than a year of fundraising and construction, the new store opened in May 2010. In the larger space, the Co-op was able to offer popular options like a prepared foods hot bar. A major renovation project followed in 2012 in Mt. Airy, with new systems and floors and the installation of a bulk foods department on the revamped second floor. Housewares and HABA moved in with pet supplies at Weavers Way Across the Way at 608-610 Carpenter Lane. In 2013, Weavers Way opened another health and wellness store, Weavers Way Next Door, at 8426 Germantown Ave., adjacent to the Chestnut Hill store. In 2012, the National Cooperative Grocers Association convened a weekend workshop at Weavers Way, inviting a dozen local co-ops, both established and aspirational, to talk about the pros and cons of growth. One takeaway: It's far easier to expand on an existing business than start a new one from scratch. By 2015, the Weavers Way Board had moved into a full-fledged search for a likely location to open a third Weavers Way store. Meanwhile, the Ambler Food Co-op had been working since 2012 to open their own store in Ambler, a borough of about 6,500 in Montgomery County. Ambler had been without a grocery store since 2009, when the local Acme closed; the opening of a Bottom Dollar store was hardly a relief ‚Äî it shut down after a year. In Fall 2016, with the blessing of Ambler Borough Council, Weavers Way announced the new store would open in the abandoned Bottom Dollar location at 217 E. Butler Ave. With a member loan campaign bringing in $1.5 million, renovations began May 2017. The new store opened in October 2017.

He eventually moved to compete on the Maryland circuit which at the time was a major player in Thoroughbred racing offering some of the best purses at a number of high-profile racetracks such as Pimlico Race Course, Bowie Race Track, Laurel Park and the Timonium Racetrack. During his career, Bud Stotler trained for major owners such as for Sagamore Farm and beginning in 1932, simultaneously for the Shoshone Stable of William R. Coe. For Coe, Stotler conditioned the 1932 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Ladysman.Thoroughbred Heritage Champions In the last few years of his career he trained for Charles Howard, owner of Seabiscuit.Tuscaloosa (Alabama) News - January 18, 1945 Of his four starters in the Kentucky Derby Stotler's best finish was second in 1934 with Discovery and from seven starters in the Preakness Stakes his best was a second with Ladysman in 1933. The Sagamore Farm years Sagamore Farm was a Glyndon, Maryland breeding farm with full training facilities. Hired in 1925, the operation was owned by Margaret Emerson, heiress to the Bromo-Seltzer fortune and widow of the also wealthy Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt who lost his life when the RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915. In 1933, she gave the farm and racing stable to her son Alfred Jr. and Stotler remained as the Sagamore Farm manager and trainer. Bud Stotler would earn national championship honors in 1935, winning 37 stakes races and earning more purse money than any trainer in the United States.

Business Divisions Investment Banking ‚Ä¢ Corporate Advisory ‚Ä¢ Debt & Restructuring Advisory ‚Ä¢ Cross Border M&A; Advisory ‚Ä¢ Private Placements History PJ SOLOMON was founded in 1989 by Peter J. Solomon and was one of the first private independent investment banking firm on Wall Street, created to mirror the ethos and culture of the original privately held investment banks at a time when many of the large investment banks had gone public. In the ensuing decades, the firm has grown to more than 90 people, drawing senior bankers from major Wall Street investment firms, has expanded into a number of new verticals - including infrastructure and energy, and added a second office in Houston, Texas. In June 2016, PJ SOLOMON entered into an alliance with Natixis, the international corporate, investment, insurance and financial services arm of Groupe BPCE, France's second largest financial institution - selling a 51% stake in the firm. Today the remaining 49% of its ownership continues to be held by its existing partners. The Natixis investment was intended to create an enhanced global M&A; advisory and financing platform, coupling Solomon's entrepreneurial spirit with a multi- faceted debt and equity financing vehicle that offers international reach across the Americas, EMEA and Asia. The firm celebrated another milestone in December 2017 when it launched a corporate rebranding, including the transition to a new logo and name, PJ SOLOMON. Peter Solomon is a former Vice Chairman of Lehman Brothers where he was co-chairman of investment banking. From 1978 to 1980, Mr. Solomon served as Deputy Mayor of Economic Policy and Development in New York City under Mayor Edward Koch, and in 1980, he served as Counselor to the United States Treasury in the Carter Administration.

In 1646 Chanut met and corresponded with the philosopher Ren√© Descartes, asking him for a copy of his Meditations. Upon showing Christina of Sweden some of the letters, the queen became interested in beginning a correspondence with Descartes. She invited him to Sweden, but Descartes was reluctant until she asked him to organize a scientific academy. He resided with Chanut, and finished his Passions of the Soul. Chanut lived at V√§sterl√•nggatan, 450 meters from Tre Kronor (castle) on Gamla Stan. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian barometer, a tube with mercury. Chanut was criticized when he organized a private mass in his house.Rome and the Counter-Reformation in Scandinavia: The Age of Gustavus ... by Oskar Garstein, 565 Descartes died of pneumonia according to Chanut.http://pavellas.com/category/sweden/stockholm/ Over time there have been speculations regarding the death of the philosopher. Theodor Ebert claimed that Descartes did not meet his end by being exposed to the harsh Swedish winter climate, as philosophers have been fond of repeating, but by arsenic poisoning.Descartes was 'poisoned by Catholic priest' - The Guardian, Feb 14 2010 Vasterlanggatan 68. In 1651, during Second Northern War, Chanut departed to L√ºbeck to a Congress which had to mediate peace between Sweden and Poland. Peace talks failed, however, and in 1653 Chanut returned to Stockholm. He probably invited Pierre Bourdelot and Gabriel Naud√©, but departed to The Hague, where he was appointed as ambassador. In 1655, back in Paris, he became Conseiller d'Etat. In the summer of 1654, Christina left Sweden and settled in Rome. In August 1656 Christina traveled to Paris. In October, apartments were assigned to her at the Palace of Fontainebleau, where she committed an action which stained her memory ‚Äì the execution of marchese Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi, her master of the horse.

A product of Columbia University, he received the A.B. from Columbia College in 1948 after service in the United States Army, and was awarded the Ph.D. in anthropology in 1962 from the Columbia Faculty of Political Science. Influential figures in his early professional years were Conrad Arensberg, Marvin Harris, Charles Wagley and Margaret Mead from the Columbia faculty and M. G. Smith, the eminent British-trained anthropologist whom he first met during field work in Jamaica. Background His teaching career in anthropology began in 1958 at Columbia University. Six years later he joined the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences at Teachers College, Columbia University as associate professor. In his new position, he helped create doctoral programs in Applied Anthropology and Anthropology and Education. A full professor by 1967, Comitas directed the Division of Philosophy, the Social Sciences, and Education (1979‚Äì1996) and the Institute for International Studies (1984- ) at Teachers College. He was director of the Institute for Latin American and Iberian Studies from 1977 to 1984 at Columbia. He was awarded the Gardner Cowles Chair in Anthropology and Education in 1988. In tandem with university responsibilities, he was connected to the Research Institute for the Study of Man, for years a leading Caribbean-focused foundation, first as associate director (1959‚Äì1985) and then as director (1985‚Äì2001), a connection that led him professionally back to the West Indies and forward to Bolivia and the Soviet Union. During the formative years of the Peace Corps (1961‚Äì1962), he helped train two of the earliest units in the field (St. Lucia I and Jamaica I), evaluated country teams in Bolivia, St. Lucia, Barbados and Jamaica and negotiated and programmed in British Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica and Barbados. He co-directed the first Peace Corps research project, a complex study of considerable importance that led to the book Changing Rural Society: A Study of Communities in Bolivia and other publications. Thomas Bailey, President of Teachers College, and Stephanie J. Rowley, Teachers College Provost, summarized his personality, career, and accomplishments in an obituary published in The New York Times on March 8, 2020: \\"world-renowned anthropologist, world-class humorist and raconteur, cherished mentor, respected academic statesman, and beloved member of our faculty for more than 56 years as the Gardner Cowles Professor of Anthropology & Education. One of the world's preeminent authorities on Hispanic and non-Hispanic cultures in the Caribbean, Professor Comitas helped develop the concept of occupational multiplicity, identifying workers who defied classification as peasant farmers or other categories. His work provided important insights for government programs and international aid aimed at improving people's economic circumstances. And for nearly 40 years, beginning in 1967, he reviewed and annotated more than 2,000 anthropological publications for his biennial West Indian section in the Handbook of Latin American Studies, issued by the Library of Congress. More recently, Professor Comitas focused on the role of visual anthropology in research, using a photo and video database that he had built over many years. Professor Comitas also had a transformational impact on Teachers College. He helped to create doctoral programs both in Applied Anthropology and Anthropology & Education. From 1979 through 1996, he directed what was then TC's Division of Philosophy, the Social Sciences, and Education, as well as the Institute for International Studies. He also directed Columbia's Institute for Latin American and Iberian Studies and was affiliated with the Research Institute for the Study of Man, a leading Caribbean-focused foundation. Finally, he derived enormous joy and pride from overseeing the doctoral dissertations of some 100 students, many of whom went on to become accomplished scholars. There is no replacing a scholar and human being of Lambros Comitas' caliber. He was cherished, and will be greatly missed.\\" =Fields of Expertise= As an anthropologist, Comitas was known primarily as a Caribbeanist who carried out field studies in both the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caribbean. However, he also worked in Bolivia, Greece, the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, the Canary Islands and Andorra. A leading figure in problem-related fieldwork, he contributed to the understanding of maritime communities in the Antilles; community structure and rural education in Bolivia; education and change in the Creole Caribbean; and was well known for developing the concept of occupational multiplicity. Contributing to burgeoning Caribbean research in the latter half of the 20th century, he completed two projects designed to compile a definitive bibliography of the scholarly and scientific literature of the non-Hispanic Caribbean from 1900 to 1975. In addition, from 1967 to 2005, he reviewed and annotated some two thousand anthropological publications for his biennial West Indian section in the Handbook of Latin American Studies, an authoritative bibliographic source issued by the Library of Congress. In more recent years, Comitas developed a long-held interest in the research utility of visual anthropology focusing on a photo and video database that he accumulated over the years. A specialist on the sociocultural aspects of drug usage, Comitas was intimately linked to several innovative studies of drugs and society (1972‚Äì1981) in the Caribbean and in Greece, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health and National Institute on Drug Abuse. His work on drugs was best highlighted by the acclaimed and controversial sociomedical study Ganja in Jamaica (1975), a multidisciplinary work that explores the chronic use of cannabis in socio-medical perspective finding few or no negative medical consequences due to heavy marihuana use. A number of books, dissertations and articles, by project staff and former students, based on evidence drawn from the Jamaica and Greek studies generally supported the benign results of the original studies. =Comitas's Commitment to Ethnography= A firm believer in the necessity for thoroughly preparing fledgling anthropologists, Comitas taught in a graduate department for well over fifty years. A ferocious advocate of field training, he served as executive secretary of the unique Columbia-Cornell-Harvard-Illinois Summer Field Study Program; directed seven summer-long graduate student training sessions to Barbados, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Andorra; and he initiated the Ruth Landes Memorial Fund that, during his tenure as director, provided grants to universities for developing systematic field training at these places. He considered that his effort to form several generations of anthropologists in the United States was perhaps his most satisfying professional accomplishment. In this context, he had sponsored well over a hundred of his students to receive the doctorate in anthropology. Awards and honours Comitas was the recipient of many awards, including the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship and grants from Fulbright, Spencer Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NATO, the U.S. Office of Education, the Government of Andorra and the government of the Canary Islands. He was a fellow of the American Anthropological Association and the New York Academy of Sciences, and was elected president of the Society for Applied Anthropology in 1970, as well as a member of the National Academy of Education in 1979.

It makes use of smart card technologies and additional security measures.  History  The CIPURSE open security standard was established by the Open Standard for Public Transportation Alliance to address the needs of local and regional transit authorities for automatic fare collection systems based on smart card technologies and advanced security measures. Products developed in conformance with the CIPURSE standard are intended to: *include advanced security technology, *support multiple applications, *help enable compatibility with legacy systems, and *be available in a variety of form factors. The open CIPURSE standard is intended to: *promote vendor neutrality, *enable cross-vendor system interoperability, *reduce the risk of adopting new technology, and *improve market responsiveness. All of these factors are intended to reduce operating costs and increase flexibility for transport system operators.  Background  In the past, public transport systems were often implemented using standalone, proprietary fare collection systems. In such cases, each fare collection system employed unique fare media (such as its own style of ticket printed on card) and data management systems. Because fare collection systems did not interoperate with each other, payment schemes and tokens varied widely between local and regional systems, and new systems were often costly to develop and maintain. Transport systems are migrating to microcontroller-based fare collection systems. These are converging with similar applications and technologies, such as branded credit-debit payment cards, micropayments, multi-application cards, and Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile phones and devices. These schemes will enable passengers to use transit tokens seamlessly across multiple transit systems. These new applications demand higher levels of security than most existing schemes that they will replace. The OSPT Alliance defined the CIPURSE standard to provide an open platform for securing both new and legacy transit fare collection applications. Systems using the CIPURSE open security standard address public transport services, collection of transport fares, and transactions related to micropayments. The transition to an open standard platform creates opportunities to adopt open standards for important parts of the fare collection system, including data management, the media interface and security. An open standard for developing secure transit fare collection solutions could make systems more cost-effective, secure, flexible, scalable and extensible.  Specification  In December 2010, the OSPT Alliance introduced the first draft of the CIPURSE standard. It employs existing, proven open standards, including the ISO/IEC 7816 smart card standard, as well as the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard and the ISO/IEC 14443 protocol layer. Designed for low-cost silicon implementations, the CIPURSE security concept uses an authentication scheme that is resistant to most of today‚Äôs electronic attacks. Its security mechanisms include a unique cryptographic protocol for fast and efficient implementations with robust, inherent protection against differential power analysis (DPA) and Differential fault analysis attacks. Because the protocol is inherently resistant to these kinds of attacks and does not require dedicated hardware measures, it should be both more secure and less costly. It is intended to guard against counterfeiting, cloning, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks and other security threats. The CIPURSE standard also: * Defines a secure messaging protocol * Identifies four minimum mandatory file types and a minimum mandatory command set to access these files * Specifies encryption keys and access conditions * Is radio frequency (RF) layer agnostic * Includes personalization and life cycle management, as well as system functionality to provide interoperability and fast adoption * Provides a security concept and guidelines OSPT Alliance technology providers are allowed to add functionality outside the common core (which is defined in the standard) to differentiate their products, so long as they do not jeopardize interoperability of the core functions. Introduced in late 2012, Version 2.0 of the CIPURSE Specification is the latest version. Designed as a layered, modular architecture with application-specific profiles, the open and secure CIPURSE V2 standard comprises a single, consistent set of specifications for all security, personalization, administration and life-cycle management functions needed to create a broad range of interoperable transit applications ‚Äì from inexpensive single-ride or daily paper tickets to rechargeable fixed-count or weekly plastic tickets to longer-term smart card- or smart phone-based commuter tickets that can also support loyalty and other applications. Three application-specific profiles ‚Äì subsets of the CIPURSE V2 standard tailored for different use cases ‚Äì have been defined, with which vendors are required to comply when creating products targeting these applications: * CIPURSE T ‚Äì Takes advantage of the new transaction mechanisms included in the specification to support the use of high-level, microprocessor-based transactions using smart cards, mobile phones and similar devices for more complex transit fare applications, such as monthly or annual tickets, multi-system tickets and loyalty programs. * CIPURSE S ‚Äì Supports tickets that can be recharged for a specific number of rides or weekly tickets and is essentially equivalent to and supplants the current CIPURSE 1.1 specification. * CIPURSE L ‚Äì Supports applications that use very inexpensive, disposable single-ride or daily tickets. Products based on different profiles can be added to fare collection systems at any time and can be used in parallel to provide transit operators the greatest flexibility in offering riders a range of transit fare options. Because they are derived from the same set of specifications, all the profiles are interoperable, reflect the same design criteria and have the same appearance, enabling developers to create products according to a family concept. With its modular ‚Äúonion-layered‚Äù design, the CIPURSE standard can be easily enhanced in the future with additional functionality and new profiles created to address changes in technology and business. The CIPURSE V2 specification enables technology suppliers to develop and deliver innovative, more secure and interoperable transit fare collection solutions for cards, stickers, fobs, mobile phones and other consumer devices, as well as infrastructure components. In early 2013, the OSPT introduced the CIPURSE V2 Mobile Guidelines, a comprehensive set of requirements and use cases for developing and deploying CIPURSE-secured transit fare mobile apps for near field communication (NFC)-enabled smartphones, tablets and other smart devices. Providing everything developers need to implement and use the CIPURSE V2 open security standard when embedded in an NFC mobile device, the new guidelines enable transit operators to enhance their systems to support mobile ticketing with these new form factors.  Organization  Founded by smart card manufacturers Giesecke & Devrient GmbH (G&D;) and Oberthur Technologies and chip suppliers Infineon Technologies AG, and INSIDE Secure S.A. (formerly INSIDE Contactless) in January 2010, the OSPT Alliance collectively defined the CIPURSE standard.

Early life Born in Finglas, Dublin, he left school and joined the Irish Army. Rising to the rank of corporal, he gained a black belt in karate but was dishonourably discharged after beating up a new recruit. Criminal Having separated from his first wife and two children and unable to pay child support, he met one of Dublin's major ecstasy dealers in a gym in Buckingham Street. Working as a doorman at the Hogan Stand public house, he started selling drugs for the gang. Leaving his doorman's job, he began distributing cannabis across Dublin for John Gilligan's gang, becoming the gang's quartermaster. Bowden cleaned and loaded the pistol used to kill Veronica Guerin, which he believed would be used by Patrick \\"Dutchy\\" Holland only to threaten her. After the murder of Guerin, Bowden, like the other members of Gilligan's gang who were still in Ireland, was arrested. Informant In an agreement with the Attorney General of Ireland, he agreed to turn state's witness and become the first person to enter the country's witness protection programme. Granted complete immunity from prosecution for the murder of Guerin, he was the only witness to give evidence against all four drug gang members at their trials in the Special Criminal Court: Holland, Paul Ward, Brian Meehan and Gilligan. Bowden was subsequently prosecuted and found guilty for drugs and firearms offences. Sentenced to six years in jail, he was held under armed protection in prison in a special secure four-cell unit at Arbour Hill Prison, alongside John Dunne and Russell Warren, who also gave evidence against the drug gang members. It was confirmed in April 2001 by the Attorney General of Ireland's office, that Bowden had been released from jail. Following discussions with foreign state witness protection programmes, Bowden and his second wife, Juliet Bacon had been relocated abroad. The family had been provided with a house, the mortgage for which was to be paid by the state, and Bowden was given a job compatible with his abilities and education. It is an offence under Irish law to try to contact him or to publish his whereabouts.
