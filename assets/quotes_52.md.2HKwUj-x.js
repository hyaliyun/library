Tsiradzho. Sirajov's Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 89. According to a second list of all the Guantanamo detainees, published on May 15, 2006, Sirajov was born on May 6, 1975. Poolad T Tsiradzho was transferred to Slovakia in January 2010. Background Sirajov graduated in 1992 from Turkey's Erciyes University. He then worked, as a translator, for a Turkish construction company. Azerbaijani Guantanamo detainee to be handed over to Azerbaijan soon, Azerbaijan Press Agency, April 24, 2006 According to his family Sirajov disappeared on February 16, 2001. They are skeptical that he voluntarily joined up with a radical group because he was not particularly religious. The ICRC says he was captured at Mazari Sharif, Afghanistan. He was reported to have been released to the Netherlands, but he was transferred to Slovakia in January 2010. In June 2010 Sirajov and two other former Guantanamo captives were reported to have gone on a hunger strike, to protest the conditions in the Slovak facility where they were kept.  Official status reviews  =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= The Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants (OARDEC) was forced to publish documents from the annual status reviews it held in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Poolad T. Tsiradzho was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... are fighters for the Taliban.\\" * Poolad T. Tsiradzho was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... stayed in Al Qaeda, Taliban or other guest- or safehouses.\\" * Poolad T.

Tsiradzho was listed as one of the captives whose \\"names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.\\" * Poolad T. Tsiradzho was listed as one of the captives who was a foreign fighter. * Poolad T. Tsiradzho was listed as one of the captives who \\"deny affiliation with Al Qaeda or the Taliban yet admit facts that, under the broad authority the laws of war give armed parties to detain the enemy, offer the government ample legal justification for its detention decisions.\\" * Poolad T. Tsiradzho was listed as one of the captives who had admitted \\"fighting on behalf of Al Qaeda or the Taliban.\\" =Habeas petition= Sirajov had a habeas corpus petition published on his behalf. But, although the Department of Defense published documents from the CSR Tribunals of 179 captives, they did not publish any of his habeas documents. In July 2008 the US District Court ruled that his habeas petition was moot. On December 30, 2008 United States Department of Justice official Daniel M.

Tsiradzho\`s assessment was dated January 25, 2008, and was nine pages long. It was signed by camp commandant Mark H. Buzby, and recommended continued detention under DoD control. Recruitment Gamat Suleyman, the head of the Baku's Abu Bakr mosque, denied reports that said Polad had been recruited through the mosque.Bin Laden's alleged aide Azeri, AzerNews, March 13, 2006 Suleyman said that with thousands of worshipers he did not know all of them personally, but he denied that \\"Wahabism, which is followed by radicals, including the leader of the Al-Qaeda terror cell bin Laden, has never been propagandized at Abu Bakr.\\" Rafig Aliyev, chairman of the State Committee for Work with Religious Associations, stated that 54 people had been arrested in the Mosque in the past, and that Wahabism is still promoted there. He expressed skepticism that a sole individual could contact bin Laden, without help.

In 2009 Spanish newspapers reported Spain was considering accepting his transfer, along with five other men. Polad was transferred to Slovakia in January 2010, with two north African men. Polad and the other men found that Slovakian security officials were insisting they be held under more onerous security restrictions than they experienced in Camp four Guantanamo.

The company has no theatre building of its own; instead it tours work to theatres, village halls, schools and site-specific locations, both at home and internationally. The company has created over 200 productions and collaborates with other theatre companies, local authorities, and individual artists to create a variety of performances, from large-scale productions through to theatre specifically made for the smallest venues. Many different spaces have been used for productions, as well as conventional theatres: airports and tower blocks, community halls and drill halls, ferries and forests. The creation of a national theatre was one of the commitments of the Scottish Executive's National Cultural Strategy. Formation After Scottish devolution in 1997, long-discussed plans for a national theatre for Scotland began to come to fruition. In 2000, the Scottish Executive invited the Scottish Arts Council to conduct a feasibility study into a Scottish national theatre, and an independent working group subsequently reported in May 2001. The model for a National Theatre of Scotland (NTS) that was resolved upon was a commissioning theatre, a \\"theatre without walls\\", with no need for a new theatre building or a permanent company of actors, but making use of existing theatre buildings, actors and technical staff to create new work to be staged in venues throughout Scotland and internationally. In September 2003, the Scottish Executive announced confirmed funding of ¬£7.5m for the establishment of the NTS, with ¬£3.5m for the year April 2004 to March 2005 and ¬£4m for the following year.

For Hong Kong and Macau, see Communications in Hong Kong and Communications in Macau. The telecommunications industry in China is dominated by three state- run businesses: China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. The three companies were formed by restructuring launched in May 2008, directed by Ministry of Information Industry (MII), Nationals Development and Reform Commissions (NDRC) and Minister of Finance. Since then, all the three companies gained 3G licenses and engaged fixed-line and mobile business in China. As a result of China‚Äôs entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, a new regulatory regime is being established and foreign operators are being allowed to access the market. China‚Äôs second generation of mobile communications equipment market is dominated by European and North American companies. Because of the unique characteristics of mobile communications, most of China‚Äôs mobile communications equipment demands are filled by imports. The quickly rising Chinese manufacturers, however, led by Huawei and ZTE are turning to South American, Southeast Asian and African countries for business opportunities and are increasingly raising their market share in China. As of 2009, Huawei Technologies is expected to surpass Nokia-Siemens Networks and Alcatel-Lucent to become the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment. In March 2012, there 284.3 million fixed-line telephone subscribers and 1.01 billion mobile phone subscribers in China.Donald Melanson, 30 March 2012, China officially tops one billion mobile subscribers, Engadget2012-03-30, China mobile phone users exceed 1 billion, China Daily30 March 2012, China's mobile phone subscriptions top a billion, AFP  Introduction  The Chinese telecommunication sector‚Äôs growth rate was about 20% between 1997 and 2002. China fixed-line and mobile operators have invested an average of US$ 25 billion on network infrastructure in the last years, which will be more than all western European carriers combined. As a result, with 1.3 billion citizens, China has the world‚Äôs largest fixed-line and mobile network in terms of both network capacity and number of subscribers. China‚Äôs accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on December 11, 2001 resulted in the gradual opening of the telecom services market to foreign companies.  Historical overview  Before 1994, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MTP) provided telecom services through its operational arm, China Telecom. Pressured by other ministries and dissenting customers, the Chinese government officially started the telecom industry reforms in 1994 by introducing a new competitor: China Unicom. China Unicom could hardly compete with the giant China Telecom. In 1998, due to a ministerial reorganization, the MTP was replaced by the new Ministry of Information Industry (MII). The MII took two large scale reshuffling actions targeting the inefficient state-monopoly. In 1999 the first restructuring split China Telecom‚Äôs business into three parts (fixed-line, mobile and satellite). China Mobile and China Satcom were created to run, respectively, the mobile and satellite sectors but China Telecom continued to be a monopoly of fixed-line services. The second restructuring in 2002 split China Telecom geographically into north and south: China Telecom - North kept 30% of the network resources and formed China Netcom (CNC) and 70% of the resources were retained by China Telecom - South or simply the new China Telecom. Parallel to this double fission, the telecommunications division of the Ministry of Railways (MOR) established a new actor in 2000: China TieTong.J. Wang, C. Werker, Telecommunications Equipment Market in China Stat-USA Market Research Reports. 2004 These resources consisted of a 2,200,000 km long nationwide optical network, based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technologies and several submarine cables, in particular with the USA, Japan, Germany and Russia. To sum up, the Chinese telecom industry has changed from a state-run monopolistic structure to state-run oligopolistic structure. In May 2008, MII, NDRC and Minister of Finance announced the third restructuring proposal and also launched three 3G licenses. With the rapid development and serious competition, Chinese telecom operators face challenges on shrinking landline users, too rapid growth on mobile business, low profit services and great gaps among the carriers. The third revolution was to combine six main telecom operators into three, aiming of developing 3G business and full telecom services, and avoiding monopolistic and over competition.  Regulatory environment  The MII is responsible, among other duties, for elaborating regulations, allocating resources, granting licenses, supervising the competition, promoting research and development and service quality as well as for developing tariff rates.China: Telecommunications. US Commercial Service. 2003.C. Sharkey, M. Wang, An Overview of the Telecommunications and Broadcasting Market in China, Stat-USA Market Research Reports. 2003. The MII has built up a nationwide regulatory system composed of Provincial Telecommunications Administrations (PTA) with regulatory functions within their respective provinces. A number of other significant institutions also influence the industry, such as the State Development and Reform Commission (SDRC). Following its WTO accession, China is starting to make plans, including adopting western-style telecommunications law and setting up an independent regulatory and arbitration body to deal with the telecom operators. Since 2014, the Cyberspace Administration of China is responsible for setting policy and the regulatory framework for user content generated in online social activities on Internet portals.  Foreign participation  Prior to its WTO accession, China‚Äôs policy protected the national emerging telecom industry since it was and is a national priority sector. Only foreign equipment vendors were allowed to invest in China.E. Sauted√©, Telecoms in China: Towards a Post-WTO Shock Therapy?, China Perspectives. 2002. Authorization for the investments was conditioned on technology transfer. International telecom carriers were banned from accessing the market. As part of the WTO commitments, the Chinese government is opening gradually the carriers market to foreign investors. There are some geographical limits to this opening but they will be progressively relaxed. In 2005 foreign investors were authorised to form joint ventures, investing up to 50% in Internet services in the whole country, up to 49% in the mobile sector in 17 major Chinese cities and up to 25% in fixed-line basic services in Beijing, Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou). Finding a Chinese partner to form a joint venture with, preferably a major carrier is mandatory for a foreign company wishing to access the Chinese market. Foreign investments come, in order of importance, from the United States, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, Japan and South Korea. Main companies from these countries already have one or more Joint Ventures, not all of which are ultimately successful.  Market overview  As of March 2012, China has 284.3 million fixed-line subscribers and 1.01 billion mobile customers. Chinese telecom operators focus their effort on voice. Revenues from data only account 5%.S. Lin, A new Changing Landscape. 2003 New technologies are being deployed to provide differential services. These technologies include ADSL, wireless LAN technology, IP (Internet Protocol) telephony and services associated with mobile communications such as Short Messaging Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), ring tone download etc. Premium SMS connectivity is allowing entrepreneurs and established businesses to profit from revenue taken directly from users' monthly phone bills or pre-paid credit. One of the first companies to offer such Chinese Premium SMS connectivity to the world market and to advise on the regulations and requirements involved are mBILL. Chinese operators are often cautious in purchasing cutting-edge technologies.J. Wang, C. Werker, Telecommunications Equipment Market in China Stat-USA Market Research Reports. 2004. Mobile communication, especially Global System for Mobile (GSM) is the most profitable sub sector and reports 46% of all total revenues. Halfway between mobile and fixed, Xiaolingtong is a limited mobility service based on Personal Access System (PAS)/Personal Handy Phone System (PHS) technology. It consists of a wireless local loop that provides access to the fixed-line network. With over 50 million users, PAS/PHS competes in big cities head to head with traditional mobile services since prices are typically far cheaper.C. Watts, \\"China‚Äôs Telecom Market: An overview\\", China Business. 2003.  Telecom operators  As of 2009, the telecom operators in China are exclusively Chinese: two fixed-line operators with nationwide licenses - China Telecom and China Unicom - three mobile carriers - China Telecom (CDMA and CDMA2000), China Mobile (GSM and TD-SCDMA) and China Unicom (GSM and WCDMA).

Public safety system  With increasing awareness of the importance of government‚Äôs ability to deal with critical situations, there is a growing demand for emergency response systems in China. Without an organization like the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) in the United States, China has not yet developed a national technical standard for its emergency response system. Large and economically well-off cities in China like Beijing, Tianjin, Nanning and Chengdu have started building public safety networks by introducing TETRA-based digital trunking system that integrate with their existing analogue systems. More Chinese cities followed in 2005. There has been development of database software, interoperability consoles and data management systems.

Originated by Carl Kohler and drag-racing artist Pete Millar, it was published by Robert E. Petersen Publication Company as a quarterly starting in 1959. Editors over the years included Dick Day, Jack Bonestell, and Dennis Ellefson. It should not be confused with the earlier Cartoons Magazine of the 1920s. The original CARtoons went defunct in 1991. In 2016, CARtoons resumed publication under new ownership of the trademark, and is currently published bimonthly. The original CARtoons featured articles, comic strips, step-by-step how-to drawing pages and more. The first issue included a comic strip, Rumpsville: The Saga of Rumpville, illustrated by Millar. In the 1960s until 1975 it carried the Unk and them Varmints strip (by Mike Arens and Willie Ito). Through the years, some of the featured artists were Alex Toth, Tom Medley, Mike Arens, Jim Willoughby, Russ Manning, Willie Ito, Dale Hale, George Trosley (creator of Krass & Bernie), John Kovalic, Shawn Kerri (one of the few women who drew for the magazine), Duane Bibby, Steve Austin, Dave Deal, Joe Borer, Nelson Dewey, Bob Hardin, John Larter, Robert Williams, William Stout, Quentin Miller, Jim Grube, Errol McCarthy, and Dennis Ellefson.

Publication history  Originally published quarterly, in 1962 the magazine became bi-monthly. During some years in the 1970s and 1980s, the magazine published eight issues per year. In 1975, the magazine underwent a complete overhaul with a new logo, new artists and new features. The late 1970s and early 1980s issues included iron-ons, a feature which ended in 1983, later replaced by a center poster which often was a larger print of the cover art. The original run of CARtoons magazine folded with the August 1991 issue. In 2015, Ontario artist Marc Methot successfully filed for the abandoned CARtoons trademark.

He is referred to in 2 Samuel 8:9-10 as \\"Toi\\" and 1 Chronicles 18:9-10 as \\"Tou\\".Footnote k at in the New King James Version Both biblical accounts state that Tou paid homage to David, king of Israel, because he had defeated the army of Tou's enemy, Hadadezer, king of Zobah. Biblical text (KJV) 2 Samuel 8:9-10 reads: 9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 10 He sent Joram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. See also Wikisource: 1 Chronicles 18 Context According to biblical studies professor Gershon Galil, \\"the Empire of David is a realistic historical phenomenon and the biblical description of its formation and consolidation is possible and reasonable ... Eight inscriptions recently discovered at different sites clearly indicate that a large kingdom named Palistin existed in northwestern Syria and southern Turkey. This is the reference to the ancient kingdom of Palistin, recently proposed by several scholars, which encompassed the cities Hamath, Aleppo and Carchemish,\\" Prof. Galil says. \\"This kingdom was inhabited by different groups including Sea Peoples. They invaded the Levant in the 12th century BC, conquered vast areas, destroyed kingdoms and took over their lands.\\" Gilil notes that \\"some of these inscriptions open with the words 'I am Tai(ta) the Hero, King of Palistin'. Given our philological and historical knowledge, it's clear that Tai(ta) should be identified with Toi, mentioned in the Book of Samuel and in Chronicles.\\"ScienceDaily.com, The history of King David, published 15 December 2014, accessed 23 February 2020 Palistin was one of the Syro-Hittite states which emerged in Syria after the Late Bronze Age collapse. OUP Oxford, 2012 It dates to at least the 11th century BC and is known primarily through the inscriptions of its king Taita and his wife. Analysis The text tells that King David successfully defeated an enemy of Tou's, Hadarezer, the king of Zobah. To congratulate David (and remind him that he was friendly to David), he sent his son Hadoram as an ambassador and with him a (presumably) large tribute, made mostly up of vessels of gold and silver and brass. David added them to his treasury, after rededicating them.

Its history, past and present achievements establish the institution as the most prestigious centre for training of maritime (merchant marine and Navy) specialists in the country. Its development over the years resembles a navigable river, into which many tributaries flow, as well as the \\"prototypes\\" of the present-day faculties, departments, and vocational colleges constituting the Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy. The foundations of maritime education in this country were laid in the city of Ruse pursuant to Circular order ‚Ññ7/January 16, 1881 of the Ministry of War of the Principality of Bulgaria. The circular order announced the establishment of a Maritime School, as of January 9, 1881. History has retained the name of the founder of the institution, lieutenant commander Alexander Egorovich Konkevich, \\"Superintendent\\" of the Fleet and the Maritime Unit (the official name of the Bulgarian Navy in the 19th century). VVMU Varna. Lieutenant 317x317px Early years (1881‚Äì1919) The Maritime School was entrusted with the task to train machinists and stokers for the Navy of the principality. After 1883, official documents refer to the school as \\"Machine School\\", \\"Technical School\\", \\"Machine Class\\", but it did not change its status and continued to successfully train technical specialists for the Fleet and the Navy. In 1885, graduates of the school fought in the Serbo- Bulgarian War and two of them received awards for their gallantry. Under the influence of the reforms of the Minister of Education Georgi Zhivkov, the last decade of the 19th century is characterized by the development of educational institutions in Bulgaria. This process also affected many aspects of the maritime education. As a result, in 1892 the school was reorganized and renamed Petty officer Naval School which trained boatswains, ratings, artillerymen, miners and machinist mates. That same year the first diploma of the naval Alma mater preserved for posterity was awarded. The first Commandant of the Maritime School 2nd Lt. Dip (Eng) Pavel Alexeevich Mashnin (1848, Sevastopol ‚Äì 1900, Port Arthur). In 1893, the first Temporary Course in Naval Sciences for training of line officers was organized in the city of Ruse. Insofar as the Maritime School of 1881 was not only the start of the Naval Academy, but also a prototype of the modern Engineering Faculty and most departments in it. The Temporary Officer Course of 1893 was a prototype of the modern Navigation Faculty, as well as departments in it such as Naval Tactics Department, Navigation and Fleet And Ports Operation. In fact, the organization of the \\"Temporary Course\\" marks the beginning of the historical development of the educational structures training navigational specialists in this country. The course trained officers, graduates of the Military School in Sofia, to acquire naval qualifications, as well as Bulgarian graduates of foreign naval schools who for some reason did not manage to graduate abroad. The participants in the Temporary Officer Course passed and exam and were awarded the qualifications of naval officers. At the turn of the 20th century, the Sub-officer Maritime School made a new step forward. In 1900 it was headed by lieutenant Todor Solarov. It was during his time in office that the institution was moved to the city of Varna and renamed Engineering School to the Fleet. Todor Solarov justified the need for more thorough training of its graduates, as a result of which in 1904, with an act of the National Parliament, it became the first technical secondary school in the country and the duration of training was extended to six years. In 1906 the school issued the first matriculation certificates. In 1910, the first building specially designed and erected for the needs of the Engineering School to His Majesty's Fleet was built in Varna. Diploma of graduate Hadzhipanteleev from 1892. The oldest diploma of the Maritime School preserved for posterity. 1913‚Äì1916 The building of the Engineering School to His Majesty's Fleet. The unit which remained in Ruse was renamed Miner and Stoker School (Miner school with stoker training) with duration of training of four years, including practical training, with the first two-year of training recognized as compulsory military service for the students. The Miner and Stoker School was temporarily closed down in 1909. In 1912, due to the fleet's increased need of technical specialists, it was reopened under the name Maritime Special Schools, which in turn were subordinate to the newly formed structure in Varna called Training Unit (later renamed Maritime Training Unit). The schools were established in 1912. In 1913 they admitted the first class of 34 cadets. Originally, the Maritime Special Schools consisted of three units: mining and electrical engineering, stoker and steersman. During World War I, the Diver School and Radiotelegraphy School were formed and briefly functioned. The duration of training in the schools was four years. They can be seen as the prototype of the present-day Postgraduate Studies Department and Professional Sergeant College within the Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy. By 1912, the Training Unit included not only the Special Schools, but also the Engineering School to His Majesty's Fleet. In the wars for national unification (1912‚Äì1918), graduates of the Training Unit participated in the mine laying and mine sweeping operations, the attack against the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye, the Assault operations in Balchik, Kavarna and Kaliakra, the Engagement of Balchik on December 13, 1916. They had the honour of mastering the new naval equipment: seaplanes and the first Bulgarian submarine. This was the period when French, and then German language studies were introduced and as a result, some of the graduates of the Engineering School to His Majesty's Fleet were selected to become naval officers and sent for training at the Academia Navale in Livorno (Italy ‚Äì 1914), and later at the Marineschule M√ºrwik (Germany ‚Äì 1916‚Äì1918). Changes occurred in the Engineering School also. In 1917, after a short training course for a select group of graduates of the naval Alma mater, the first officer class graduated. In 1918, the school received the building of the present-day Aquarium in the Sea Garden, where it remained until 1922. After the wars for national unification, the maritime education system underwent another reorganization. The Training Unit was now called the Maritime Training Unit and for the first time it was in charge of all educational structures from which most modern faculties, departments and colleges of the Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy originate. The Maritime Training Unit (1912‚Äì1948) and its subordinate structures in the period 1927‚Äì1931.  The establishment of the present name  In the period 1919‚Äì1920, the officer training course was not only successfully conducted but also the first graduates, pursuant to Decree of the Council of Ministers ‚Ññ 6/ June 1, 1920, were issued a certificate for completed higher specialized naval education \\"following the full curriculum of the Maritime Corps in St. Petersburg\\". Diplomas of higher education were also issued to the participants in the preceding courses. Later the curriculum of this structure was significantly improved. In 1925 and 1928, based on the accumulated experience, two Shipmaster courses were formed, after taking which the trainees, after many years of theoretical and practical training, were issued diplomas for completed higher specialized naval education. Later some of them became prominent members of the Maritime Police Service (the official title under which the Bulgarian Navy existed under the terms of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur- Seine) and \\"master mariners\\" at the Bulgarian Commercial Shipping Company (the predecessor of Navigation Maritime Bulgare LTD) Under the terms of the peace treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, in the spring of 1921, His Majesty's navy was disbanded. But a year earlier, the Engineering School was no longer subordinate to the War Ministry and was renamed Marine Engineering School. Practical parts of the training were conducted in the arsenals, on board ships, in electrical engineering classrooms, in telephone exchanges, in radio transmitter rooms, in power plants, in railway depots and workshops, on board the destroyers, in Bozhurishte, in the mines in Pernik and many other places. For a time the school was subordinate to the Ministry of Industry and Labour, and later ‚Äì to the Ministry of Railways, Communications and Ports. Graduates could continue their studies in all tertiary technical institutions. Practically, immediately after the end of the First World War, the Steersman School (unit), part of the Maritime Special Schools, was separated and transformed into Fisherman School, which existed until April 1, 1934. In 1929, the status of the Marine Engineering School was set out in a special law and it was renamed Maritime School. Two years later a Seagoing Department was created, which was tasked with training watch officers for the merchant marine. The officers of the Maritime Police Service were trained partly in the Maritime School in Varna and graduated from the Military School in Sofia. The college in Sofia, which later became a tertiary institution in 1923, issued their diplomas insofar as an officer needs to have college education and under the terms of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine Bulgaria was allowed to have only one military college. In 1930, the Maritime Special Schools were reorganized and three new units were created: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical and Motor. Their programs (i.e. curricula) were supplemented and improved. The Engineering School and Miner and Stoker School, later renamed Maritime Special Schools, were the first educational institutions in the country which not only trained hundreds of qualified specialists for the needs of the navy and the emerging Bulgarian industry. They became the backbone of the middle technical level personnel in the country. In 1934, the Marine Engineering School was moved into the buildings of the already closed Fisherman School on the island of St. Cyril near the town of Sozopol. In 1940, the school returned to Varna in the large imposing building on Stefan Karadzha Street. That same year, its graduates participated in the assault operation in Balchik during the return of Southern Dobruja in the borders of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. In 1942, with a royal decree, the Maritime School received the status of specialized higher maritime school and the name His Majesty's Naval School. In 1943, a Maritime unit was opened in the Reserve Officer School ‚Äì Varna, created to His Majesty's Naval School for training of officers of the reserve for the Navy. In the period 1945‚Äì1946, the school was called \\"Naval People's School to the Maritime Forces\\", and in 1946‚Äì1949 ‚Äì \\"People's Naval School\\". In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, graduate of the school from the Class of 1926 and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.  Present days and activities  A special page in the history of the naval Alma mater is the training of foreign cadets, an objective criteria for the increased international prestige of the educational institution. The beginning was in 1953 when some Czech students and Albanian cadets were admitted. By 1994, a total of 141 foreigners from eleven countries on four continents received their college diplomas from N. Y. Vaptsarov Naval Academy. Circa 1986. Foreign cadets in front of the monument of the school's patron. Award for achievements in the framework of the Movement for \\"Technical and Scientific Creativity of the Navy Youth\\" (TNTFM, in Bulgarian –¢–ù–¢–§–ú), IXth session, 1977, to graduate engineer Atanas Totchkov. In 1954, the school moved into its present facility on 73, Vasil Drumev Street. With a Decree of the Presidium of the National Assembly of 1956, it received the status of higher engineering maritime school and was renamed N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Higher Naval School. In 1960, it was entered in the registers of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to UN, which recognized its diplomas before all ship owners in the world. In 1968, an additional floor was added to the main building on campus. Since 1991, the school's new name is Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy. In 2000, the Naval Academy was entered in IMO's White List an approved provider of maritime education and training, conforming to the STCW 78/95. In 2001, with a decision of the National Agency for Assessment and Accreditation to the Council of Ministers, it received full accreditation as a university, in accordance with the new Law on Higher Education. In 2000, it received an ISO 9002.4 quality certificate for the discipline \\"Navigation\\" from the Lloyd's Register, and in 2004 ‚Äì ISO 9001-2000 for all disciplines. In September 2007, at the request of the Defence Minister and with an order of the Minister for Education and Science of Republic of Bulgaria, the Professional Petty Officer College to the Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy in Varna was founded. Nowadays the Academy continues to train officers for the Bulgarian Navy and the Merchant Marine according to world-acknowledged standards. Bulgarian Navy officers are prepared for their duty at sea and they take part in many exercises in close cooperation with NATO ships. Graduating officers for the merchant fleet find their professional career as captains and ship power-plant engineers in foreign companies in the US, England, Japan, France, Germany, Norway, Italy, Greece, Israel, Turkey, Philippines, etc. During their years at the Academy, sea-going students and cadet engage in rowing, swimming and sailing training as well as boat steering. They also double the duties of the different positions during the practice on board the Navy ships and Merchant vessels. At the end of the educational process they practice as third officer. Additionally, there are series of naval exercises and sailing competitions that sea-going students and cadets can take part in. An important international activity for the Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is its membership in the International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU) since 2004. The Academy takes active role in the development of the organization and supports the development of strategies in maritime education and training (MET). It also serves for two mandates as regional representative for Europe. In addition to that, the Academy has hosted some of the committee meetings of IAMU. Students of the Academy have attended international student meetings related to popularization of the maritime profession.

Government  G√ºlcan Ka√ßmaz Sayyiƒüit from the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) was elected mayor at the local elections in March 2019. In September 2019 five council members of the HDP were dismissed and replaced with trustees. The Kaymakam is Muhammet Fuat T√ºrkman.  Etymology  # The current name of Edremit originates from Armenian name of Artamet, which literally means \\"Near the Fields\\" in Armenian, as it lies near the fields of grape and apple trees at the coastline of lake Van. Also, Artamet deserved the title of the capital of Armenian apples, because during millennia Artamet's apples believed to be better in the whole Armenia. # The Greek name for Edremit is Adramyttion (ŒÜŒ¥œÅŒ±ŒºœçœÑœÑŒπŒøŒΩ). Greeks connect this name with the ancient Greek goddess Artemis. # The Latin name is Adramyttium.  History  Artamet's foundation predates the Christian era. It was founded as a small town at the shores of Lake Van in Tosp district of Vaspurakan province lying in the middle of Historical Armenia. In the course of history, the city has had several names: Artemida, Zard, Artashessyan, Avan, Artavanyan and now - Edremit. In the time of the Urartian Kingdom, the Edremit gardens were irrigated by the Menua Canal and known to be fertile. In the 10th century Artamet was known as a feudal city with a population of 12 000\\\\. It was renowned for the best apples in all Armenia. At the beginning of the 19th century Artamet had approximately 500 houses, 435 of which were Armenian, and 65 Turkish. After the first Armenian genocide of 1894‚Äì1896 the number of Turkish houses rose so quickly that the city consisting of 600 families has already 200 Armenian and 400 Turkish families. On the edge of the Armenian genocide Armenians lived mainly in central part of Artamet, Turks settled near peripheral gardens and fields. Before 1915 Artamet had 10 Armenian churches and 1 Greek church. Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians and other local Christians were almost entirely destroyed by Turks in 1915-1923 Armenian genocide. After the legal owners were massacred, thousands of their historical monuments were annihilated as well. Events of Artamet in 1915 are described in the book of Venezuelan writer Raphael de Nogales.Four Years Beneath the Crescent Earthquake On the 9 November 2011 an earthquake of the magnitude of 5.9 Mw occurred in Edremit.

An example of algorithmic art produced with the software Structure Synth. Algorithmic art or algorithm art is art, mostly visual art, in which the design is generated by an algorithm. Algorithmic artists are sometimes called algorists. Overview Algorithmic art, also known as computer-generated art, is a subset of generative art (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to systems art (influenced by systems theory). Fractal art is an example of algorithmic art. For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest algorithms require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers. The final output is typically displayed on a computer monitor, printed with a raster-type printer, or drawn using a plotter. Variability can be introduced by using pseudo-random numbers. There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art. History Islamic geometric patterns such as this girih tiling in the Darb-e Imam shrine in Isfahan, are precursors of algorithmic art. Roman Verostko argues that Islamic geometric patterns are constructed using algorithms, as are Italian Renaissance paintings which make use of mathematical techniques, in particular linear perspective and proportion. Paolo Uccello made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating linear perspective in paintings such as The Battle of San Romano (c. 1435‚Äì1460): broken lances run along perspective lines. Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by Georg Nees, Frieder Nake, A. Michael Noll, Manfred Mohr and Vera Moln√°r in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a plotter controlled by a computer, and were therefore computer-generated art but not digital art. The act of creation lay in writing the program, which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the plotter. Sonia Landy Sheridan established Generative Systems as a program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.Sonia Landy Sheridan, \\"Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas\\", in: Leonardo, Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.Flanagan, Mary. \\"An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan.\\" The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: Hood Museum of Art, 2009, pp. 37‚Äì42. Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are fractal artworks created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was \\"drawn\\" by a plotter, fractal art simply creates an image in computer memory; it is therefore digital art. The native form of a fractal artwork is an image stored on a computer ‚Äìthis is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense \\"fractal art\\" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist. In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist Ernest Edmonds has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole. The role of the algorithm Letter Field by Judson Rosebush, 1978. Calcomp plotter computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became Digital Effects' Vision software, in APL and Fortran on an IBM 370/158. A database of the Souvenir font; random number generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line raster image, output to a plotter. From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an algorithm devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include computer code, functions, expressions, or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take. This input may be mathematical, computational, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be deterministic, meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, fractals made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using genetic algorithms. The artist Kerry Mitchell stated in his 1999 Fractal Art Manifesto: This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto. Algorists \\"Algorist\\" is a term used for digital artists who create algorithmic art. Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled \\"Art and Algorithms\\" at SIGGRAPH in 1995. The co-founders were Jean- Pierre H√©bert and Roman Verostko. H√©bert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm: if (creation && object of art && algorithm && one's own algorithm) { return * an algorist * } else { return * not an algorist * } =Types= Morphogenetic Creations, a computer-generated digital art exhibition using programmed algorithms by Andy Lomas, at the Watermans Arts Centre, west London, 2016 Cellular automata can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved. Their use has also been explored in music. Fractal art consists of varieties of computer-generated fractals with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect. Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of fractal-generating software, iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other graphics programs are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork. Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of genetic algorithms to develop images iteratively, selecting at each \\"generation\\" according to a rule defined by the artist. Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains: The American artist, Jack Ox, has used algorithms to produce paintings that are visualizations of music without using a computer. Two examples are visual performances of extant scores, such as Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony and Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate. Later, she and her collaborator, Dave Britton, created the 21st Century Virtual Color Organ that does use computer coding and algorithms.

It was released on July 26, 2004 by Century Media. Background and production Turisas was formed in 1997, but didn't have a recording contract until November 2003, having been signed by Century Media. Thus, Battle Metal is a collection of songs written over a period of six years. The band began pre-production and recorded a demo in early 2003, after Mathias Nyg√•rd, the band's singer and songwriter had completed his one-year military service. Turisas had originally planned to enter a studio later that year, but decided to postpone upon learning that only three and a half weeks of recording time would be available to them. By autumn, Nyg√•rd was offered up to five weeks of recording time at the Sound Suite Studio in Marseille, France with Terje Refsnes, a notable producer. Actual recording began in November at the Steeltrack Studio in Parola, Finland, with the violin parts by Olli V√§nsk√§, followed by accordion by Riku Ylitalo. After Tude Lehtonen had completed the drum parts, the band left for France to continue recording through December. The band had remained at the Sound Suite Studio for thirty days, but was unable to finish the recording, still missing the vocals, choirs, as well as some acoustic instruments and percussions and returned to Finland. Most of these was recorded at the Steeltrack Studio in January - February 2004, while Nyg√•rd went back to Marseille to complete the vocals; Battle Metal was finally finished on March 31. Music \\"Victoriae & triumphi dominus\\" (\\"Lord of Victiory and Triumph\\") is an instrumental intro, leading to the opening track, \\"As Torches Rise\\", meant to capture a battlefield's atmosphere of darkness and despair. \\"Battle Metal\\" is a remake of \\"The Heart of Turisas\\" from the eponymous 2001 demo with subdued growling. \\"The Land of Hope and Glory\\" delves into the themes of nostalgia and homecoming, combining folky sounds with a bombastic chorus. \\"The Messenger\\", one of the band's oldest songs, explores the topics of fate and religion. \\"One More\\" is based around a violin theme, which was first featured in the song \\"Terra Tavestorum\\", appearing on the 1999 demo of the same name. Set in a tavern, the song's mood is reminiscent of the absent friends. Its folky tunes are reminiscent of the Romani music and are complemented by a big, orchestrated chorus. \\"Midnight Sunrise\\", an older song as well, contrasts the myths of various evil creatures living in dark places, unable to handle sunlight, and coming out at night to prey with the phenomenon of the midnight sun. \\"Among Ancestors\\" is a choir-driven song, describing a battlefield on which the warring soldiers are missed by their loved ones. \\"Sahti-waari\\", which can be roughly translated as \\"Old Man Ale\\", is a homage to the traditional homebrewed beer from the H√§me region of Finland. Vaari, the Finnish word for grandfather, is not about any particular character. Rather, it is a celebration of the old traditions and their recent reemergence in the form of neopaganism. The lyrics in \\"Prologue for R.R.R.\\" are taken from the opening for the historical novel The Surgeon's Stories: Times of Gustaf Adolf by Zacharias Topelius, a Fennoswede author. \\"Rex regi rebellis\\" (\\"The King is Rebellious Towards the King\\" in Latin) is dedicated to the Thirty Years' War and the Finnish cavalry Hakkapeliitta, the topics that have fascinated Mathias Nyg√•rd since childhood. The title again comes from The Surgeon's Stories; the lyrics in Swedish are by Topelius as well, taken from \\"Finska rytteriets marsch i trettio√•riga kriget\\". \\"Katuman kaiku\\" (\\"The Echoe of Lake Katuma\\") is an instrumental outro. Katumaj√§rvi is a lake in the H√§me region, which was targeted by the Second Swedish Crusade to subjugate and Christianise the local Pagan tribes. According to a legend, when the invaders left, the locals jumped into the lake to wash away their baptism and continued to practice the old beliefs and traditions for many years to come, with some surviving into the 19th century.

A few Altaians also live in Mongolia and northern Xinjiang, China but are not officially recognized as a distinct group. For alternative ethnonyms see also Teleut, Tele, Telengit, Black Tatar and Oirats. The Altaians are presented by two ethnographic groups: *The Northern Altaians include the Tubalar (the Tuba-Kizhi), the Chelkans, and the Kumandin. *The Southern Altaians include the Altaian (the Altai-Kizhi), the Teleut, the Telengit, and used to include the Telesy who have been assimilated within the Telengits. The Northern and Southern Altaians formed in the Altai area on the basis of tribes of Kimek-Kipchaks.Ethnic history, History of a region, Statistic information at http://eng.altai-republic.ru/index.php NUPI Centre for Russian Studies http://www2.nupi.no/cgi- win//Russland/etnisk_b.exe?Altai According to a recent (2016) study, some Altaians, most likely southern Altaians, are possibly descendants of the Yeniseian people and closely related to the Paleo-Eskimo groups. History There were Caucasoid settlements during the Bronze and Iron Age in the region where the Altai people live today. From the fifth century BCE and onwards Mongoloid peoples settled in the area and soon began to blend with the prior populations. The region was then conquered or became within the sphere of influence of the Xiongnu, the Rouran Khaganate, the Turkic Khanganate, the Uyghur Empire and the Yensei Kyrgyz. During these time periods the area's local people became Turkicized culturally and linguistically. From the thirteenth to eighteenth century the Altai people were dominated politically and culturally by the Mongols. The origin of the southern Altaians can be traced during this period from the result of the mixing of Kipchak and Mongol tribes. Meanwhile, the Northern Altaians were a result of the fusion of Turkic tribes with Samoyeds, Kets and other Siberian groups. The Altaians were annexed by the Four Oirat of Western Mongols in the 16th century. The Mongols called them \\"Telengid\\" or \\"Telengid aimag\\" in the period of the Northern Yuan dynasty. After the fall of the Zunghar Khanate in the 18th century, the Altaians were subjugated by the Qing Dynasty, which referred to them as Altan Nuur Uriyangkhai.C.P.Atwood- Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.9 But Altaians are not genetically related to the Uriyangkhai, which is a distinct neighbouring Oirat Mongol ethnic group in Mongolia. The Altai came into contact with Russians in the 18th century. In the tsarist period, the Altai were known as oirot or oyrot (this name means oirat and would later be carried on for the Oyrot Autonomous Oblast). The Altai report that many of them became addicted to the Russians' vodka, which they called \\"fire water\\".\\"People from Russia ‚Äî Interviews on the Streets\\", Way To Russia, 24 September 2003 In regard to religion, some of the Altai remain Shamanists and others (in a trend beginning in the mid-19th century) have converted to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Altai mission was developed under Saint Makarii Glukharev (‚Ä† 1847), known as the 'Apostle to the Altai'. In 1904, a religious movement called Ak Jang or Burkhanism arose among these people. Prior to 1917 the Altai were considered to be made up of many different ethnic groups.Kolga et al., The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire, p. 29 With the rise of the 1917 revolution, the Altai attempted to make their region a separate Burkhanist republic called Oyrot. Their support for the Mensheviks during the Civil War led to the venture's collapse after the Bolshevik victory and the later rise of Joseph Stalin. In the 1940s, during World War II and when he was directing numerous purges, his government accused the Altai of being pro- Japanese. The word \\"oyrot\\" was declared to be counterrevolutionary. By 1950, Soviet industrialization policies and development in this area resulted in considerable migration of Russians to this republic, reducing the proportion of Altai in the total population from 50% to 20%.\\"Altay\\" , Centre for Russian Studies, NUPI, retrieved 17 October 2006 In the early 21st century, ethnic Altaians make up about 31% of the Altai Republic's population. Today, the special interests of the Altaians are articulated and defended by the Association of Northern Ethnoses of Altai.

According to the 2010 Russian census, there was a total of 69,963 Altaians who resided within the Altai Republic. This represented 34.5% of the total population of the republic, compared with 56.6% with a Russian background, Altaian families are the majority only in certain villages. However, Altaian culture is still the local culture between people and communities.  Culture  = Traditional lifestyle = The Southern Altaians were mostly nomadic or semi- nomadic livestock holders. They raised horses, goats, sheep, and cattle. The Northern Altaians mainly engaged in hunting as their primary form of subsistence. Their main prey were animals from the taiga (boreal forests). However, some Altaians also engaged in small-scale agriculture, gathering, and fishing. = Dwellings = Most of the Southern Altaians traditionally lived in yurts. Many Northern Altaians mainly built polygonal yurts with conic roofs made out of logs and bark. Some Altai-Kizhi also lived in mud huts with birch bark gable roofs and log or plank walling. The Teleuts and a few Northern Altaians lived in conic homes made out of perches or bark. With the influx of Russians near the homeland of the Altaians, there was an increase of the construction of large huts with two to four slope roofs in consequence of Russian influence. Despite the many social and political changes the Altaians have endured, many modern and settled families still keep a yurt in their yards. These yurts are usually used as a summertime kitchen or extra room. = Clothing = The traditional clothing of Southern Altaian men and women are very similar with little differences between the two. Average clothing consisted of long shirts with wide breeches, oriental robes, and sleeves. Other apparel often included fur hats, high boots, and sheepskin coats. Northern Altaians and some Teleuts traditionally wore short breeches, linen shirts, and single-breasted oriental robes. Despite the fact that most Altaians today wear modern clothes, traditional wear still remains in use. = Cuisine = Altaian cuisine consists of soups of horseflesh or mutton. Dishes with gopher, badger, martmot, fermented milk, cream (from boiled milk), blood pudding, butter, fried barley flour, and certain vegetables are also staples of Altaian cuisine. Popular drinks include aryki (milk vodka).  Religion  = History = Traditional Altaian shamanism is rich with mythology and supernatural beings. Popular deities included Yerlik, the god of the underworld and Oyrot-Khan, a sagely and heroic figure who is a composite blend taken from historical Zungarian (Oirat) Khans and ancient legendary heroes. However, with many migrations, settlement changes, and the presence of the Russians and their eventual union with the Russian Empire, the Altaians encountered three world religions: Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. At first, the Altaians were indifferent and at times even hostile to these faiths and their expansion. In 1829, an Orthodox mission was founded in the region (modern Altai Republic) as part of it being a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Orthodox missionaries often confiscated land from Altaians who refused to convert. Other Altaians were forcefully converted to Christianity. Mongolian Buddhist missionaries attempted to spread the faith among the Altaians during the 19th century. The Buddhist missionaries also encouraged the Altaians to unite together against the Russians. However, their activities and preaching were suppressed by the Russian state and Christian missionaries. Buddhism made little headway among the Altaians but many Buddhist ideas and principles entered into Altaian spiritual thought. The mission and its missionaries were initially culturally sensitive and tolerant to the Altaians and their customs. However, the rise of Russian nationalism during the late nineteenth century caused the Russification of Orthodox Christianity and the mostly Russian clergy in Siberia also took up the ideology. This created intolerant views of the natives of Siberia (including the Altaians) and of their culture. This led to the rejection of Christianity by many Altaians who saw it as a foreign Russian religion. However, Russian rule continued to grow increasingly strict both politically and religiously. Around 1904, the development of Burkhanism among the Altaians was underway. Burkhanism is a monotheistic religion named after Ak-Burkhan, a deity who is believed and recognized by adherents to have been the sole god. Burkhanism was opposed to both the Russians and the traditional shamans. The hostility towards the shamans was so great that the shamans had to seek protection from Russian authorities. The rise of the Bolsheviks in the first quarter of the twentieth century also led to the brutal repression of all religions which included the faiths in the Altai region. For the next few decades, most religions basically vanished with only shamanistic and ancient polytheistic beliefs surviving the chaos. This was believed to have occurred because ancient religious beliefs could be easily orally transmitted from generation to another. It's also likely that no Burkhanist texts survived the repression and main sources for the beliefs of the religion come from Russian missionaries, travellers, and scholars. = Modern spirituality = Recently, Burkhanism and shamanism has seen a revival in the Altai region which is especially popular among Altaian youth. At present, the majority of Kumandins, Tubalars, Teleuts, and Chelkans are Russian Orthodox although there is a significant minority that practice shamanism. Shamanism is practiced by many Telengits though there is a large amount that also profess Orthodox Christianity. Burkhanism is the main religion of the Altai-Kizhi but there is a significant number of Orthodox Christians. A few Altaians also practice Sunni Islam and Tibetan Buddhism.

Baptistery Saint-Jean of Poitiers Merovingian art is the art of the Merovingian dynasty of the Franks, which lasted from the 5th century to the 8th century in present-day France, Benelux and a part of Germany. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul in the 5th century led to important changes in the field of arts. Sculpture regressed to be little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of sarcophagi, altars and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, gold work and the new medium of manuscript illumination integrated \\"barbarian\\" animal-style decoration, with Late Antique motifs, and other contributions from as far as Syria or Ireland to constitute Merovingian art. Architecture The unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I (465‚Äì511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power- houses of the Merovingian church. Plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition, but also took influences from as far away as Syria and Armenia. In the East, most structures were in timber, but stone was more common for significant buildings in the West and in the southern areas that later fell under Merovingian rule. Most major churches have been rebuilt, usually more than once, but many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in Bishop Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by Saint Perpetuus (bishop 460‚Äì490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: \\"Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque\\".V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, The Origins of the Romanesque (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. A feature of the basilica of Saint-Martin that became a hallmark of Frankish church architecture was the sarcophagus or reliquary of the saint raised to be visible and sited axially behind the altar, sometimes in the apse. There are no Roman precedents for this Frankish innovation.Werner Jacobsen, \\"Saints' Tombs in Frankish Church Architecture\\" Speculum 72.4 (October 1997:1107‚Äì1143). The Saint Peter's church in Vienne is the only surviving one. A number of other buildings, now lost, including the Merovingian foundations of Saint- Denis, St. Gereon in Cologne, and the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris, are described as similarly ornate. Some small buildings remain, especially baptisteries, which fell out of fashion and were spared rebuilding. In Aix-en-Provence, Riez and Fr√©jus, three octagonal baptistries, each covered with a cupola on pillars, are testimony to the influence of oriental architecture (the baptistry of Riez, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, recalls that of St. George, Ezra', Syria). Very different from these Proven√ßal baptistries, except for the quatrefoil one of Venasque, that of St. Jean at Poitiers (6th century) has the form of a rectangle flanked by three apses. The original building has probably undergone a number of alterations but preserves in its decoration (marble capitals) a Merovingian character. Among the very many crypts, numerous due to the importance of the cult of saints at the time, only those of St. Seurin, Bordeaux, St. Laurent, Grenoble, and the abbey of Jouarre (7th century) survive. Other arts Sacramentarium Gelasianum. Frontispice and Incipit from the Vatican manuscript By the 7th century, the abilities of Merovingian craftsmen must have been well regarded, as they were brought to England to re-introduce glass making skills, and Merovingian stonemasons were used to build English churches.Bede. The Lives of the Holy Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow. Merovingian masons also employed the opus gallicum extensively and are responsible for bringing it to England and bequeathing it to the Normans, who brought it to Italy. Very few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts survive, of which the most richly decorated is the 8th century Gelasian Sacramentary in the Vatican Library, which has geometric and animal decoration, less complex than that of the Insular art of the British Isles, but like it derived from metalwork motifs, with some influence from Late Antiquity and the Near-East. The principal centres were the Abbey of Luxeuil, an Irish foundation, and later its daughter house at Corbie Abbey. A large Merovingian art collection in Berlin was taken by Soviet Occupiers to Russia, where it remains to this day.

The early Regimen was organized by the six non- naturals. According to Galen, they are: air, food and drink, sleeping and waking, motion and rest, excretions and retentions, and dreams and the passions of the soul.

The original Latin version was annotated and edited by Arnold of Villanova. The Regimen was contemporary with Secretum Secretorum, a health manual written by pseudo-Aristotle. However, the Regimen was more popular because the rhyming verses were easier to remember. The Regimen was translated into vernacular languages, including Irish, Bohemian, Occitan, Hebrew, German, Anglo-Norman, and Italian. Following its first appearance in print, the Regimen was translated into almost every European language, and the book achieved tremendous popularity and nearly forty different editions were produced before 1501. An English translation by Thomas Paynell was printed by Thomas Berthelet in 1528.de Mediolano, with the Commentaries of Arnaldus de Villa Nova, Regimen sanitatis Salerni: This boke techyng al people to gouerne them in helthe, is translated out of the Latyne tonge in to englishe by Thomas Paynell.

In fletestrete, in the House of Thomas Berthelet, nere to ye cundite at ye signe of Lucrece, 1528) The work itself came to be highly revered as a scholarly medical text and was seriously discussed until the 19th century. Various editions and versions of the Regimen circulated throughout Europe, many with commentaries that added or removed material from the original poem. During this interval, the Regimen was expanded from the original 364 lines to 3,526 hexameter verses. The first English translation was made by Sir John Harington in 1608. An attempt to make a medically accurate translation was made in 1871 by the American doctor John Ordronaux.Ordronaux, J. Translation into English verse of Regimen Sanitatis Salerni.

Founded on 15 October 1945 as part of the Higher Technical School (later renamed to State Polytechnic), it is an independent institution since 1953, when the Polytechnic was divided into four separate technical institutes. It has had its present name and university status since 21 July 1995 and has 14 main faculties based in Sofia, Plovdiv and Sliven, as well as 3 additional ones with education only in foreign languages ‚Äî German, English and French.  History  With Decree No 237, published in the State Gazette issue 248 from 24.10.1945, of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, a school called \\"State Polytechnic\\" is created with Mechanical engineering faculty with four divisions - mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and mining and geology. In 1953, the State Polytechnic was split into four new higher institutes, one of which was the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. It had two faculties - one of mechanical and one of electrical engineering. Two years later, in 1955, the word \\"Higher\\" was added to the name. In 1959, a faculty of Transport and Communications was formed which four years later (in 1963) was split into Faculty of Transport (existing until today) and Faculty of Radio Electronics. The last was split into three in 1987 \\\\- Faculty of Electronic Engineering and Technology, Faculty of Telecommunications and Faculty of Computer Systems and Control all existing today. Some of the staff of the newly formed Faculty of Computer Systems and Control used to previously work in the Faculty of Automatics, which was separated from the faculty of Electrical Engineering in 1974. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering was only split once, in 1963, when two new faculties - of Machine Technology and of Power Engineering and Power Machines, were formed from it. In 1991, the faculty of Management was formed. Since 1991 the Higher Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was renametd to Technical University of Sofia. The Technical University of Sofia is one of the eight holders of the European University of Technology, EUt+, with the Riga Technical University (Latvia), the Cyprus University of Technology (Cyprus), the Hochschule Darmstadt, University of Applied Sciences (Germany), the Technological University Dublin (Ireland), the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (Spain), the University of Technology of Troyes (France), the Technological University Dublin (Ireland) and the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (Romania). The European University of Technology, EUt+ is the result of the alliance of eight European partners who share in common the \\"Think Human First\\" vision towards a human-centred approach to technology and the ambition to establish a new type of institution on a confederal basis. Through EUt+, the partners are committed to creating a sustainable future for students and learners in European countries, for the staff of each of the institutions and for the territories and regions where each campus is anchored.  Campuses  The Technical University of Sofia consists of 5 campuses: Sofia, Plovdiv, Sliven, Botevgrad, Kazanlak. The Central Campus in Sofia includes 14 buildings. The entrance and the main building (Rectorate) Faculty of Electrical Engineering Building 1 used to be army barracks and now houses the administration of the university as well as the administration, the offices of scientists and most laboratories of: *The Faculty of Electronics Engineering and Technology *The Faculty of Telecommunications *The Faculty of Computer Systems and Control The University Publishing House, the University Information Resources Center are also situated there.

In April 2005, their critically acclaimed debut album I fear no foe was released in the Netherlands, receiving positive reviews from established magazines and websites, such as Oor, VPRO 3voor12 and Volkskrant. There were few negative reviews, which mostly struggled with the applause in the opening track Speech, and the diversity of the band. Shortlty after releasing the debut album, the band released a homemade music video to the song Sparrow, which consisted out of more than 1500 separate photos, resulting in an artistic animation. All in their early twenties, the band toured the Netherlands and supported such acts as The Cribs and Zita Swoon. In January 2006, the band announced the song Belly Rollercoaster from their debut album I fear no foe was to be used in a worldwide TV commercial for the Nokia 6280 mobile phone. The music video to this song proved a struggle to make, and was released several months after its premature release party. History In 2002 Anne van Wieren and Arend-Jan - two friends from high-school - decided to start a band and record a demo on their own. They both had been in bands before, but wanted to take a fresh and new approach to music, one without concessions. They record their first demo at home in Hoogezand-Sappemeer, a small municipality in Groningen. After sending the demo to several friends and people in the record industry, they receive positive feedback and decide to form a band. Gerald Kooistra (bass), Christiaan Nijburg (drums) and Rob van Essen (keys) join in and the basement of Christiaan's parents house is turned into the band's recording and practicing room. The first gigs were either really good or really bad. One of the most talked about gigs in the early years is to be played in Volta, where a girl takes place on a bar stool behind a microphone stand, only to drink wine and smoke cigarettes. In 2003, VPRO 3voor12 and Excelsior Recordings discover the band. On 3voor12 several items about the band are placed in one of which Niels Aalbert (A&R; for Universal Music Group in the Netherlands) praises the band for their ambition and commitment, comparing the band to The Lemonheads and Guided by Voices, yet he feels the band would be better at place at a smaller label such as Konkurrent or Excelsior Recordings. The latter take on the challenge, and give the band the gigs and time they need to grow before they can record their debut album. As a taste, the band release a handmade 7\\" vinyl split-single featuring the demo version of Sparrow, with the previously unreleased Spinvis song Goochelaars en geesten as the B-Side. In 2004, Rob decides to leave the band and focus on college even before the band started recording in the studio. A replacement is quickly and easily found: Martien ter Veen. In several sessions LPG record their debut album at the SSE studios in Weesp, with Frans Hagenaars as their producer. They finish recording at the end of 2004, after which the tracks are being mastered in the Wisseloord Studios by Darius van Helfteren. The band find themselves a manager in Sander Zuidema and prepare themselves for the release of their debut album by performing on both the Eurosonic and Noorderslag festival in January 2005. On April 4, 2005, the band release I fear no foe. With positive reviews coming in from several established magazines and websites, they finally find themselves a booking agency in Mana Music. An intensive tour through the Netherlands follows. The band shares the stage with such acts as The Cribs, The Dears, Voicst and Zita Swoon. Peter Weening of VERA - a famous club for the international pop underground - asks the band to perform on his 25th anniversary of this award-winning venue. Spinvis asks the band to join them, supporting his completely sold-out club-tour throughout the Netherlands. Throughout the year the gets a good name in the media, and steals the hearts of many die -hard music fans, yet fails to take the next step in becoming a mainstream act with international fame. In 2006, after a wild and successful year, the band start with more good news just before their second appearance on Eurosonic. Thanks to Massive Music (a company specializing in composing or selecting the right tracks for the right commercials, TV-shows or movies) the band get the attention of Grey advertising and Nokia, who select the song Belly Rollercoaster to be used in a worldwide TV and Radio campaign to introduce their new Nokia 6280 cellphones. This news alone gets the band a lot of international attention in the media, with several appearances on TV and Radio as a result. A week later, the band perform in a completely sold out Paradiso (Amsterdam) together with Spinvis, filmed and broadcast by Fabchannel. It takes more than 4 months after that until the Nokia commercial first airs, and the band release the music video to Belly Rollercoaster. In the meantime, the band focus on their performances and promotion on MySpace, attracting an increasing number of fans on the LPG MySpace profile In June 2006 the band announce a change of management. Sander Zuidema, who has managed the band from the start, is to focus more on internet promotion, whilst a new manager Maarten van der Helm, bass-player of Skik, is attracted in order to let the band take the next leap forward. During live performances the band start to play new songs and in the media they hint their next album might become a bit more consistent and up-tempo. In the summer they perform - and are to perform - on several festivals in the Netherlands, closing down with a theatre performance in their hometown Hoogezand-Sappemeer. In 2007 LPG record their new album, to be released in 2008, with Frans Hagenaars in the SSE studio's in Weesp. In October 2007, they use 11.000 Tomato paste cans to recreate a band photo on the Spui square in The Hague. The resulting photo, taken from great height, will be used as their new album cover. Video footage of the band creating this artwork can be found over here. Biography (taken from the official LPG website) LPG is a versatile band from the Netherlands, full of ambition. In their songs, you can clearly hear the old legends of the 60s and 70s (Beach Boys, Beatles, Velvet Underground, Neil Young), combined with influences from the more recent indie-scene (Beck, Beta Band, Blur, Pavement (band), The Shins, Sufjan Stevens), resulting in catchy, polyphonic pop songs full of surprising twists and bends. LPG is also greatly involved in creating their own artwork, merchandize and promotion. The band's motto is 'to accomplish as much as possible by doing as much as possible' for a reason. With performances on Eurosonic, a Nokia commercial and plenty of new songs for a second album it's more than clear that LPG is still to accomplish a lot more than they already have.

He served for 18 months and participated in 17 battles on the Western Front. He saved his regiment from surprise mustard gas attacks, found and comforted the wounded, and allegedly once caught a German soldier by the seat of his pants, holding him there until American soldiers found him. His actions were well-documented in contemporary American newspapers. Reprinted in Stubby has been called the most decorated war dog of WWI, and the only dog to be nominated for rank and then promoted to sergeant through combat. Stubby's remains are in the Smithsonian Institution. Stubby is the subject of a 2018 animated film. Early life Stubby was described in contemporaneous news items as a Boston Terrier or \\"American bull terrier\\" mutt. Describing him as a dog of \\"uncertain breed,\\" Ann Bausum wrote that: \\"The brindle-patterned pup probably owed at least some of his parentage to the evolving family of Boston Terriers, a breed so new that even its name was in flux: Boston Round Heads, American...and Boston Bull Terriers.\\" Stubby was found wandering the grounds of the Yale University campus in New Haven, Connecticut in July 1917, while members of the 102nd Infantry were training. He hung around as the men drilled and one soldier in particular, Corporal James Robert Conroy (1892-1987), developed a fondness for him. When it came time for the outfit to ship out, Conroy hid Stubby on board the troop ship. As they were getting off the ship in France, he hid Stubby under his overcoat without detection. Upon discovery by Conroy's commanding officer, Stubby saluted him as he had been trained to in camp, and the commanding officer allowed the dog to stay on board. Military service Sgt. Stubby wearing his coat, dog tag and medals. Stubby served with the 102nd Infantry Regiment in the trenches in France for 18 months and participated in four offensives and 17 battles. He entered combat on February 5, 1918, at Chemin des Dames, north of Soissons, and was under constant fire, day and night for over a month. In April 1918, during a raid to take Seicheprey, Stubby was wounded in the foreleg by retreating Germans throwing hand grenades. He was sent to the rear for convalescence and, as he had done on the front, improved morale. When he recovered from his wounds, Stubby returned to the trenches. In his first year of battle, Stubby was injured by mustard gas. After he recovered, he returned with a specially designed gas mask to protect him.Marie Lux, Anna. \\"Janesville author breathes new life into Stubby the war dog\\". The Janesville Gazette (WI). 2014. Thus learning to warn his unit of poison gas attacks, locate wounded soldiers in no man's land, and‚Äîsince he could hear the whine of incoming artillery shells before humans‚Äîbecame very adept of alerting his unit when to duck for cover. He was solely responsible for capturing a German spy in the Argonne, leading to their unit's Commander nominating Stubby for the rank of Sergeant. Following the retaking of Ch√¢teau-Thierry by the US, women of the town made Stubby a chamois coat upon which his many medals were pinned. He was later injured again, in the chest and leg by a grenade. He ultimately had two wound stripes. At the end of the war, Robert Conroy smuggled Stubby home. After the war Gen. John Pershing awards Sergeant Stubby with a medal from the Humane Education Society at a White House ceremony, 1921 After returning home, Stubby became a celebrity and had marched in, and normally led, many parades across the country. He met Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren G. Harding. He also appeared on vaudeville stages owned by Sylvester Z. Poli and was awarded lifetime memberships to the American Legion and the YMCA. In 1921, General of the Armies John J. Pershing presented a gold medal from the Humane Education Society to Stubby, the subject of a famous photograph and other artistic media. During that same year, he attended Georgetown University Law Center along with Conroy, and became the Georgetown Hoyas' team mascot. He'd be given the football at halftime and would nudge the ball around the field to the amusement of the fans.* While still a student at Georgetown, Conroy was also employed as a special agent of the Bureau of Investigation, precursor to the FBI. Stubby died in his sleep in March, 1926. After his death, he was preserved with his skin mounted on a plaster cast. Conroy later presented Stubby to the Smithsonian in 1956. Legacy Sgt. Stubby's brick at Liberty Memorial Stubby received an obituary in the New York Times following his death in 1926. The obituary was half a page, much longer than the obituaries of many notable people of that time period. He's also the subject of a portrait by \\"Capitol artist\\" Charles Ayer Whipple. He was featured in the Brave Beasts exhibit at the Legermuseum in Delft, The Netherlands July 18, 2008 ‚Äì April 13, 2009. During a ceremony held on Armistice Day in 2006, a brick was placed in the Walk of Honor at the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City to commemorate Sergeant Stubby. Stubby became the subject of at least 4 books. In 2014, BBC Schools WWI series used Stubby as a Famous Figure to help teach children about the war, along with creating an animated comic strip to illustrate his life. Stubby has his portrait on display at the West Haven Military Museum in Connecticut. The descendants of Robert Conroy dedicated a life-size bronze statue of Stubby named \\"Stubby Salutes,\\" by Susan Bahary, in the Connecticut Trees of Honor Memorial at Veteran's Memorial Park in Middletown, Connecticut, in May 2018. The statue pays tribute to fallen Connecticut Veterans, where both Stubby and Robert Conroy are from.  Animated Film  Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero is an animated feature-length film based on the life and times of Stubby. Theatrically released on April 13, 2018, the film features the voices of Logan Lerman, Helena Bonham Carter, and G√©rard Depardieu with music by Academy Award nominee Patrick Doyle. The animation is made by the studio Mikros Image and produced by Irish-American studio Fun Academy Media Group. The film received high marks from film critics and was officially endorsed by several high- profile institutions, including the Humane Society of the United States, the Armed Services YMCA, the Westminster Kennel Club, and the United States World War One Centennial Commission. Unfortunately, the film's nationwide release coincided with studio tent-poles Avengers: Infinity War and Rampage, as well as the expansion of Wes Anderson's critically acclaimed, animated dog movie Isle of Dogs. The film currently holds an 88% Tomatometer score on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and has received numerous awards including the Parents' Choice Foundation Gold Award and The Dove Foundation's All Ages Seal of Approval, despite the film not containing any explicit faith-based messaging. Despite the initial theatrical setback, Sgt. Stubby has been released in over two dozen countries and picked up festival awards in Australia, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Left to right: moron, sagmani, and binagol. Pasalubong (Tagalog, \\"[something] for when you welcome me\\") is the Filipino tradition of travellers bringing gifts from their destination to people back home. Pasalubong can be any gift or souvenir brought for family or friends after being away for a period of time. It can also be any gift given by someone arriving from a distant place. Pasalubong are also associated with the balikbayan, Overseas Filipinos returning to the Philippines, and may refer to items that migrant workers bring home to their families, friends, relatives or even non-relatives that they feel especially close with. Description Pasalubong is a Tagalog word, a variant of the word pansalubong or pangsalubong. It comes from the root word \\"salubong\\" which means \\"(to) welcome\\", \\"to meet\\", or \\"reception\\". The prefix \\"pa-\\" is a contraction of \\"pang-\\", roughly equivalent to the English suffix \\"-er\\". Thus, the word \\"pasalubong\\" can be roughly translated as \\"something meant for you when you welcome me back.\\" The word has minor celebratory connotations, as in rejoicing the safe homecoming of someone who was away for a time. In Visayan languages, pasalubong is also referred to as tinabuan in Cebuano and sinugatan in Hiligaynon. Both of which have the same meanings as the Tagalog word. The Philippine English acronym B.H. (for \\"Bring Home\\") is also frequently used. Pasalubong, in general, is a \\"gift for a relation or friend brought by a traveler returning from a trip,\\" and could also refer to \\"anything given as a gift to someone on the way home to a certain place.\\"\\"Tagalog-English Dictionary by Leo James English, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, Manila, distributed by National Book Store, 1583 pages, page 1167, It could also mean \\"homecoming gift\\" or any present which signifies appreciation to the services rendered by the recipient.Flavier, Juan M., Doctor to the Barrios, The Workers: The Science Missionaries, Chapter 3, page 71. The pasalubong usually consists of native delicacies or indigenous things from the region or country where the traveler came from. For example, a vacationer coming back from Negros might bring home some piaya to his family, while someone coming home from Hawaii might bring macadamia nuts. The length of time the person is away is inconsequential. A pasalubong can be given coming home from work each day to returning to one's hometown after decades of being in another country. Cultural significance Various items sold at the Baliuag Pasalubong Center in Baliuag, Bulacan The tradition of giving a pasalubong is of great cultural importance for Filipinos as it strengthens the bond with the immediate family, relatives, and friends. In rarer instances, it can even be used to forge stronger relationships with someone you may not know that well, as with someone you may be meeting for the first time. The gesture of handing out pasalubong emphasizes the gladness at reuniting with one's loved ones and the relief at being back home safe. It is also a sign of thoughtfulness. While pasalubong are not compulsory or even expected, failing to bring pasalubong for someone can sometimes be perceived negatively. Particular importance is given to gifts for children, and the anticipation of getting pasalubong from a parent coming home is often a cherished childhood memory for most Filipinos. By bringing gifts with regional significance (e.g. things that cannot be acquired locally), the person coming home can also share part of his travels. It similar to the western concept of souvenirs except that it is not meant for personal remembrance but for sharing the experience with others, especially as the different islands and regions of the Philippines can have different languages, local customs, and cuisine specialties. The pasalubong serves as a 'sample' of another region's specialty, bringing different Filipino cultures closer together. They can also simply be gifts likely to be appreciated. Unlike western gifts, pasalubong are not wrapped, but are given as is. The person who gives the pasalubong can also freely partake of the gift. Typical pasalubong Piaya, one of the typical pasalubong from Bacolod Various regions in the Philippines have their own specialties in food, handicrafts, and the like. These are promoted to local tourists via the pasalubong custom. It is not unusual for bus stops to have stalls nearby which sell the specialty pasalubong of the respective regions they are located in. They don't always have to be regionally significant, however. Pasalubong can range from ordinary sweets (like chocolates), regional delicacies, to imported confectionery goods. They can also be other items like clothing, accessories, novelty items, ornaments, handicraft items, artwork, and toys, among others. They can even be ordinary things that may be hard to acquire in a given region. Pasalubong can be as mundane as fast-food take-outs, toys, snacks or fruit given to children below 10 years of age by a parent coming home from work. It can also be as exotic as a balikbayan box filled with gifts from a foreign country; it is an adaptation of the idea of the pasalubong for the Filipino diaspora. Unlike traditional pasalubong, these are not usually given in person but are sent by air freight.

The history of the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia began in prehistoric times with archaeological evidence revealing occupation of the district by Australian Aborigines for at least 23,000 years. The first early European colonizers began arriving in the late 1700s, settlement soon followed throughout the 19th century, and by 1959 the town was proclaimed a city. Today, the Gold Coast is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia. Kombumerri Aboriginal history in the Gold Coast region Archaeological evidence suggests that Aboriginal people have inhabited the Gold Coast region for about 23,000 years before European settlement and the present. By the early 18th century there were several distinct clan estate groups (previously referred to as tribes) living between the Tweed and Logan Rivers and bounded approximately in the west by the town of Beaudesert; they are believed to be: the Gugingin, Bullongin, Kombumerri, Minjingbal, Birinburra, Wangerriburra, MununjaliHolmer, Nils M. 1983.

Grammar, Vocabulary, and Notes of the Wangerriburra Tribe, appendix to the Report of the Protector of Aboriginals, Brisbane. Collectively they were known as Kombumerri people and spoke the Yugambeh language,Cunningham, M 1969 A Description of the Yugumbir Dialect of Bandjalang. University of Queensland Papers 1:69‚Äì122 for which there was and is evidence of several distinct dialects in the region. The historical Kombumerri people were hunters, gatherers and fishers, and are reported to have trained dingos and even dolphins to aid them in the hunting and fishing processes. Various species were targeted in various seasons, including shellfish including eugaries, (cockles or pipis), oysters and mudcrabs. In winter, large schools of finfish species \\"running\\" along the coast in close inshore waters were targeted, those being sea mullet, which were followed by a fish known as tailor. Turtles and dugong were eaten, but the latter only rarely due to their more northerly distribution. Various species of parrots and lizards were eaten along with bush honey. Echidnas, (an Australian native similar to a porcupine, but a monotreme not a rodent), are still hunted with dogs today and various marsupials including koalas and possums were also consumed. Numerous plants and plant products were included in the diet including macadamias and Bunya nuts and were used for medicinal purposes. Unlike their neighbours to the north of the Logan and west and south west of Beaudesert, the Kombumerri people not only spoke dialects of a different language group, but along with other members of the Y-Bj dialect chain to the south, subscribe to an originary myth known as \\"The Three Brothers\\", which is based on the arrival to this part of the eastern Australian coastline by 3 men/mythical culture heroes and their wives and children in a canoe: Berang- ngehn gurilahbu, ngering Mumuhm, Yabirahyn or Berrungen korill√•bo, ngerring Momm√≥m, Yabur√≥ng Berrung came long long ago, with Momm√≥m (and) Yabur√≥ng Long ago, Berrung together with Momm√≥m (and) Yab√∫rong came to this land. They came with their wives and children in a great canoe, from an island across the sea. As they came near the shore, a woman on the land made a song that raised a storm which broke the canoe in pieces, but all the occupants, after battling with the waves, managed to swim ashore. This is how ‚Äòthe men,‚Äô the paig√•l (baygal) black race, came to this land. The pieces of the canoe are to be seen to this day. If any one will throw a stone and strike a piece of the canoe, a storm will arise, and the voices of Berr√∫ng and his boys will be heard calling to one another, amidst the roaring elements. The pieces of the canoe are certain rocks in the sea. At Ballina, Berr√∫ng looked around and said, nyung? (nyang)and all the paig√•l about there say nyung to the present day. On the Tweed he said, ngando? (ngahndu)and the Tweed paig√•l say ngando to the present day. This is how the blacks came to have different dialects. Berr√∫ng and his brothers came back to the Brunswick River, where he made a fire, and showed the paig√•l how to make fire. He taught them their laws about the kipp√•ra, and about marriage and food. After a time, a quarrel arose, and the brothers fought and separated, Momm√≥m going south, Yabur√≥ng west, and Berr√∫ng keeping along the coast. This is how the paig√•l were separated into tribes.Livingstone, Rev. H. 1892. Short Grammar and Vocabulary of the Dialect spoken by the Minyung People, Appendix A _in_ (NLA catalogue entry) The area around present day Bundall, proximate to the Nerang River and Surfers Paradise, along with various other locations in the region was an established meeting place for tribes visiting from as far away as Grafton and Maryborough. Great corroborees were held there and traces of Aboriginal camps and intact bora rings are still visible in the Gold Coast and Tweed River region today, including the bora ring at the Jebribillum Bora Park at Burleigh Heads. Captain James Cook was the first recorded European to have visited the Gold Coast when he sailed past on 16 May 1770. As Europeans settled the Gold Coast region and began farming and timber-gathering in the 19th century it was thought by some that the Kombumerri were driven from their traditional hunting, gathering and fishing grounds into the hinterland and missions and Aboriginal reserves which followed the passage of the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (61 Vic, No.17), generally cited as the 1897 Act: \\"... (it) was the first comprehensive Aboriginal protection act in Queensland and, indeed, in Australia; it ushered in the long era of protection and segregation during which Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders lost their legal status as British citizens and became, in effect, wards of the state\\". \\"Regional administrative control of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of the State was achieved by dividing the State into Protectorates. Each Protectorate was administered by a local Protector of Aboriginals who was a police officer in all cases except for Thursday Island. The appointment of local Protectors began in 1898. Local Protectors had many responsibilities including the administration of Aboriginal employment, wages, and savings bank accounts. Local Protectors also played a significant role in the removal of Aboriginal people to reserves\\". However, analyses of historical and anthropological records show that many of the Kombumerri remained in their traditional country and found employment with farmers, oyster producers and fishermen, timber cutters and mills constructed for the production of resources like sugar and arrowroot, whilst continuing to varying degrees with the Kombumerri cultural practices, laws and customs that were in evidence at the time of the arrival of the colonists. Many of them, both men and women (and sometimes children), found employment as servants or staff in the houses of the wealthy squatters and businessmen. Due to the harshness of the 1897 Act, and the various equally draconian amendments to it in the last century, and with respect to various government administrations, Kombumerri Aboriginal people have to date maintained a relatively low political profile in the Gold Coast region so that they would not be removed from their families, or from their traditional country with which they had (and retain) strong spiritual links. As a result, and since that time, the Kombumerri people have maintained close and generally closed networks of communication amongst themselves regarding their cultural practices and use of language which were not accommodated by the authorities. Early European history Springbrook Road was built in the 1920s English navigator Captain James Cook became the first European to visit the Gold Coast when he sailed past on 16 May 1770. As an explorer under the commission of the Royal Navy he had the foresight to name Mount Warning (a volcanic outcrop inland) as a natural beacon for a hazardous reef off the mouth of the Tweed River near a rocky outcrop he named Point Danger. Captain Matthew Flinders, an explorer charting the continent north from the colony of New South Wales, sailed past again in 1802 but the region remained uninhabited by Europeans until 1823 when explorer John Oxley landed at Mermaid Beach, (named after his boat, a cutter called Mermaid). Despite the area's relatively early appearance on colonial maps, it wasn't until New South Wales government surveyors charted the region in 1840 that the area was really brought to the attention of European settlers. The hinterland's supply of redcedar began drawing timber cutters to the region in large numbers in the mid-19th century and in 1865 the inland township of Nerang (named after the local aboriginal word neerang, meaning ‚Äòshovel-nosed shark‚Äô) was surveyed and established as a base for the industry. The surrounding valleys and plains were quickly developed as cattle, sugar and cotton farms and by 1869 settlement had reached the mouth of the Nerang River on the Southern edge of Moreton Bay. The township of Southport was surveyed in 1875 in a location known as Nerang Creek Heads. Figurehead of the Scottish Prince Figurehead of the wrecked ship, Scottish Prince at Southport, 1895. In 1885 Queensland Governor Musgrave built a holiday home known as the 'Summer Place' on the banks of the Nerang River near Southport and the surrounding coastal area began to get a reputation as a resort for Brisbane's wealthy and influential. Summer Place remains in situ at The Southport School and serves as Biddle House, the senior school boarding house. Tallebudgera Post Office at Tallebudgera The rough bush tracks and numerous creek crossings be between Brisbane and Southport made it difficult to reach without a boat, but in 1889 a railway line was extended to the town and numerous guesthouses and hotels were soon established up and down the coastline. During the 19th century many ships ran aground along the Gold Coast. One of the most famous of these shipwrecks was the Scottish Prince. Where in 1887, \\"\\"The Scottish Prince\\"\\", a 3 steel-masted iron barque 64 metres long, sank as she was sailing from Glasgow, Scotland to Brisbane with a cargo of whiskey, mousetraps, linen and other assorted cargo. The reason for it running aground, is because it is believed that the captain and many of the crew were drunk at the time. Today only the hull remains which is covered with soft corals and sponges, and is a haven for crayfish, Shovelnose rays, Leopard and wobbegong sharks, and other tropical fish. The permanent population of the region increased slowly until 1925 when a new coastal road was built between Brisbane and Southport. That same year, Jim Cavill built the Surfers Paradise hotel south of Southport in an area between the Nerang River and the beach known as Elston, and the real tourism boom began. Burleigh Heads c. 1939. As automobile technology became more and more reliable in the 1930s, the number of holiday makers traveling down the coast road from Brisbane increased, and by 1935 most of the coastal strip between Southport and the New South Wales border had been developed with housing estates and hotels. Elston residents successfully lobbied to change the name of their town to Surfers Paradise in 1933. The Surfers Paradise hotel burnt down in 1936 and was quickly replaced with another much grander structure, which had art deco styling and even included a zoo; complete with kangaroos and other wildlife. The Gold Coast during WW2 ANZAC Memorial park in Southport. Although the Gold Coast was not attacked by a foreign power in WW2, the war itself had a dramatic impact as well as most other coastal towns. It was in 1942, when the Americans began arriving. They commandeered the beach area at Coolangatta to establish rest areas. The Coolangatta Rest Area included five rest camps for Enlisted Men, and two hotels specifically for submariners. Camp No. 1 was located at Kirra Beach, along the foreshore north of Musgrave Street, in today's Roughton Park. Huts, ablutions and latrines, a kitchen/mess and an Officer's quarters and sick bay were located between the intersection with Winston Street and Lord Street, as well as down the east side of Lord Street. Camp No. 2 was at Kirra Hill, while Camp No. 3 was on Marine Parade at Coolangatta Beach. Camp No. 4 was located at Greenmount, and Camp No. 5 was at Greenmount Hill. The latter camp was located in today's Pat Fagan Park, to the north of Marine Parade. Camp No. 5 included five huts divided into 10 single cabins, a mess and recreation room, ablutions and latrines. The Royal Australian Air Force also operated a seaplane alighting area at Southport Broadwater during World War II; however, it is not known whether any particular on-shore installations were constructed as distinct from possibly floating moored pontoon landing structures. Post-war years and the birth of the name Gold Coast Burleigh Heads Beach circa 1990s. The South Coast region was a very popular holiday destination for servicemen returning from World War II. However, inflated prices for real estate and other goods and services led to the nickname of \\"Gold Coast\\" from 1950. South Coast locals initially considered the name \\"Gold Coast\\" derogatory. However, soon the \\"Gold Coast\\" simply became a convenient way to refer to the holiday strip from Southport to Coolangatta. As the tourism industry grew into the 1950s, local businesses began to adopt the term in their names, and on 23 October 1958 the South Coast Town Council was renamed \\"Gold Coast Town Council\\". The area was proclaimed a city less than one year later. Specific Gold Coast areas became the holiday destinations for many who lived inland. Coolangatta had a caravan and camping park on the New South Wales border and numerous families from Ipswich spent their Christmas holidays there. In later times, many holiday rental flats sprung up in the area. The Ipswich roots remain as the Currumbin Lifesavers, share with a similar Ipswich swimming club the title 'Vikings'. Many Vikings swimming club members joined the life saving squads at Currumbin during the holiday periods. A view from the QDeck at night, 2008 By the 1960s the Gold Coast's infrastructure had grown considerably, and the local building industry was able to support the development of high-rise holiday apartments and hotels (the first of which, Kinkabool, was completed in 1959). Surfers Paradise had firmly established itself as the leading destination and the introduction of bikini-clad meter maids in 1965 to feed parking meters by the beach to prevent holiday makers from getting parking fines was a particularly popular innovation. In 1965, the World water skiing championships were held at the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens, now known as Sea World. This was the first international event held on the coast. The hi-rise boom continued in earnest during the 1970s and by the time the Gold Coast Airport terminal opened in Coolangatta in 1981, the region had become Australia's most well-known family holiday destination and much of the vacant land within of the coast had been developed. Japanese property investment during the 1980s made the skyline soar, and the construction of modern theme parks including Dreamworld, Sea World, Warner Bros. Movie World and Wet'n'Wild Water World confirmed the Gold Coast's reputation as an international tourist centre. Some unethical business practices and State Government corruption during the late 1980s tainted the Coast's reputation as a place of business, and property marketeering (seminars which duped interstate and overseas investors into paying premium prices for new Gold Coast property developments) during the 1990s did little to help the region's image. In 1994, Queensland Local Government Commissioner, Greg Hoffmann began reviewing the local government boundaries in the Gold Coast, Albert and Beaudesert areas. After public debate, the 'Local Government (Albert, Beaudesert and Gold Coast) Regulation 1994' provided for the amalgamation of Gold Coast City Council and the Shire of Albert to create a new local authority called the City of Gold Coast Council. An election was held on 11 March 1995 and the first Council meeting was held on 24 March 1995. 21st century The Clock Hotel in the Corner of Elkhorn Avenue is an example of classical architecture revival, in an attempt to give the city more character. By the turn of the 21st century the Gold Coast had shrugged off its shady past and fully embraced the real estate boom. This boom reached its physical, and economical peak in 2005 with the opening of the 322.5m 'Worlds Tallest Residential Tower' Q1, in Surfers Paradise. In September 2010 the Gold Coast Native Title Claim QUD346/06 was registered by the Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT). This administrative decision was made under the Australian Federal Government's Native Title Act 1993 which is administered by the Federal Court of Australia. A registered claim entered on the Tribunal's Register of Claims, (which in this case is currently in mediation in the Federal Court) means that in all matters which may affect the claimants' native title rights and interests in the claim area, and under the procedural rights afforded by the Native Title Act (Cwth 1993), consultation and often negotiation with the claim group is required. Jabree Limited on behalf of the claim group is the registered cultural heritage body. Yugambeh people are now recognised as significant stakeholders in the Gold Coast region.

It stars Garcia, Dustin Hoffman, In√©s Sastre, and Bill Murray. Plot Fico Fellove is the owner of El Tropico, a swank nightclub in late 1950s Cuba. Fico lives for his family and his music, while facing the harsh realities of Batista's dictatorial regime. His brother Ricardo becomes a revolutionary, his brother Luis joins the democratic opposition, and his father Federico, a well- respected university professor, pushes for change by constitutional, peaceful means. When Ricardo is arrested and threatened with execution, Fico calls upon an old prep school friend Castel, now a police captain, for help. Ricardo is released from jail, and Fico offers to help him go to Miami or New York City, but Ricardo instead joins communist rebels headed by Che Guevara. Fico is approached by Meyer Lansky, of New York's Genovese crime family, who wishes to open up a gambling room at El Tropico. Fico, who intends for his club to remain a place of music, turns down the offer. When a bomb later explodes at the club, killing Fico's star entertainer (who is also his lover), Fico assumes that Lansky is behind it. However, in the increasingly unsettled climate, he cannot be certain. Luis becomes connected with a plot to seize the presidential palace, kill Batista, and restore democracy. The plot fails and most of the attackers are killed. Luis escapes but is killed later by Batista's secret police. At the urging of his mother, Fico tries to cheer up Luis‚Äô distraught widow AuroraFico and Aurora fall in love. The Communists seize power after Batista flees the country. Fidel Castro declares there will be no elections and Che Guevara oversees the arrests and summary execution of all those who supported the Batista regime. Among those to be executed is Captain Castel. Fico asks Ricardo, now a high-ranking officer in the new regime, to return the favor that Castel once carried out to save Ricardo's life, but Ricardo does nothing to save Castel. Ricardo visits his uncle Donoso, a tobacco farmer and cigar maker. Donoso feels that while Castro may be in power now, ‚Äúthe land endures‚Äù and says that the farm will next pass to Ricardo. Ricardo announces that the reason for his visit is to appropriate the farm for the state. Donoso, furious, has a heart attack and dies. Ricardo, overcome by grief, commits suicide shortly after the funeral. The revolution effects Fico in other ways. The musicians' union, controlled by Castro, has declared the saxophone to be an imperialist instrument and forbids its use. The club is eventually shut down on a flimsy pretext. After a chance meeting with Castro, Aurora is declared Revolutionary Widow of the Year and begins to work for the State, and she ends her relationship with Fico. Fico's parents beg him to leave Cuba and start a new family. Reluctantly, he procures exit visas for himself and Aurora. In a last effort to convince her to join him, Fico barges in on a reception for revolutionary leaders and Soviet Bloc ambassadors, but Aurora refuses to go. He raises a toast to a democratic Cuba, then leaves the reception. He says his goodbyes to his parents and goes to the airport, where most of his money and possessionsincluding a prized family pocket watch from his fatherare confiscated. Fico begins a new life in New York. Working as a dishwasher and piano player at a Cuban club, he hopes to save enough money to bring his family to America. Meyer Lansky approaches him with an offer of a Cuban nightclub in Las Vegas, but Fico turns him down. He runs into Aurora, who is in New York as part of a Cuban delegation to the United Nations.

He shows up early in the movie asking Fico for a job, and hovers around Fico, commenting on the absurdities of life, though never playing a clear part in those absurdities. According to the ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù video, the role is similar to that of a Greek chorus and is really the personality of the movie's author G. Cabrera Infante. Again, according to the making-of video, Murray was given some latitude in improvising dialogue ‚Äì the scene toward the end where Murray and Hoffman (as Meyer Lansky) discuss egg creams was almost entirely improvised. Critical response The film generally received unfavorable reviews. Rotten Tomatoes' collection of critics gave the film a 25% approval rating, with the stated consensus that \\"what starts as a promising exercise devolves into an overlong, unevenly directed disappointment.\\"The Lost City by Rotten Tomatoes Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice critiqued the historical validity of the film, stating \\"Garcia's tale bemoans the loss of easy wealth for a precious few. Poor people are absolutely absent; Garcia and Infante seem to have thought that peasant revolutions happen for no particular reason‚Äîor at least no reason the moneyed 1 percent should have to worry about.\\"\\"The Lost City\\" by Michael Atkinson, The Village Voice, April 18, 2006 However, Atkinson seems to have missed several aspects of the film that were highlighted by Garcia, including that the revolutionaries portrayed in the film who were main characters, and who sought violent uprising, were guilt-laden wealthy heirs to fortunes, not peasants, and the fact the often-cited complaints about crimes against human rights committed by Batista, were in turn adopted by the new regime. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the political dialogue in the film as \\"strictly of the junior high school variety\\" while opining that the \\"characters pontificate in generalities and aphorisms\\" making them \\"little more than stick figures with cartoon balloons pasted over their heads.\\"The Lost City: An Elegy for Old Havana by Stephen Holden, The New York Times, April 28, 2006 See also *List of American films of 2005 References External links *The Lost City Official site  Category:2005 films Category:American political drama films Category:American films Category:2000s political drama films Category:Films set in Cuba Category:Films set in Havana Category:Films shot in the Dominican Republic Category:Films about the American Mafia Category:Films about Jewish-American organized crime Category:Lionsgate films Category:Cultural depictions of Meyer Lansky Category:Cultural depictions of Che Guevara Category:2005 drama films ","title":"The Lost City (2005 film)"},{"id":"4878641","text":"Young Adam is a 1954 novel by Alexander Trocchi which tells the story of Joe, a young man who labours on the river barges of Glasgow, and who discovers the body of a young woman floating in the canal.

Gazzo. Gazzo was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance, which he lost to Robert De Niro, his co-star from the same film (as young Vito Corleone). He is nicknamed \\"Frankie Five Angels\\" from his last name, which is Greco-Italian for \\"five angels\\". Character overview Born Francesco Pentangeli in Partinico, Sicily, Pentangeli has an older brother named Vincenzo who remained in Sicily when he immigrated to the United States. Frank is a caporegime in the Corleone family, running the family's operations in New York City while Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his brother and underboss, Fredo (John Cazale), and the other two capos, Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui) and Al Neri (Richard Bright), are based in Nevada. He was a top soldier in the regime of Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), and took over the regime after Clemenza's death. He also moved into Vito's former estate in Long Beach, Long Island. His bodyguard is longtime soldier Willi Cicci. In The Godfather Part II, Frank Pentangeli is portrayed as having been one of godfather Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) most trusted associates. A rift grows between Pentangeli and Michael, however, that eventually results in Pentangeli betraying the family. Pentangeli's character was conceived in The Godfather Part II by Coppola and Puzo when actor Richard Castellano did not reprise his role as Clemenza in the sequel. The Pentangeli character took the part in the plot which was originally intended for Clemenza, whose death was to be set anti-parallel to the extended sequence in which the young Vito becomes Clemenza's partner. Coppola, in his director's commentary on The Godfather Part II, mentioned that the scenes depicting the Senate committee interrogation of Michael Corleone and Pentangeli are based on the Joseph Valachi federal hearings and that Pentangeli is like a Valachi figure. In the film Near the beginning of the story, Pentangeli approaches Michael to ask for his help in eliminating the Rosato brothers, rivals in New York, who claimed to have been promised territories by Clemenza prior to his death. Michael refuses, however, and orders Pentangeli to do nothing, as he does not want a war to interfere with an upcoming deal with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who supports the Rosatos. Pentangeli takes this as an insult and leaves in anger. Later that night, Michael narrowly escapes an assassination attempt at his home. Michael concludes on his own that Roth was behind the assassination attempt. After visiting Florida to seal the deal with Roth, Michael pays an unannounced visit to Pentangeli on Long Island and asks him to help take his revenge. As part of his plan, he insists that Pentangeli capitulate to the Rosato brothers so that Roth will not suspect that Michael is on to him. Pentangeli prefers open warfare against Roth and the Rosatos, but reluctantly obeys Michael's order. Pentangeli arranges a meeting with the Rosato brothers. Arriving at the meeting place, Pentangeli leaves his bodyguard outside and enters the bar alone. Once inside, Tony Rosato (Danny Aiello) ambushes Pentangeli with a garotte, telling him, \\"Michael Corleone says hello.\\" A policeman steps inside, and the attack degenerates into a shootout in the street. Pentangeli disappears and is believed to be dead. Later, at a Senate hearing investigating organized crime and allegations of Michael's criminal activities, Michael learns that the committee intends to call Pentangeli as a surprise witness to contradict Michael's adamant denial that he is a crime boss. Both Pentangeli and Cicci have been in the protective custody of the FBI since the attempt upon his life. Believing that Michael ordered him murdered, Pentangeli provides a sworn statement to investigators that Michael is the head of the most powerful Mafia family in the nation, controls virtually all gambling activity in North America, and has ordered countless murders. Most damningly, Pentangeli tells investigators that Michael personally killed Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) and Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), and also began planning a mass slaughter of New York's other Mafia bosses as early as 1950. Cicci has also disclosed this to the FBI. However, he is unable to directly implicate Michael in any criminal activities; due to \\"buffers\\" in the Corleone organization he never received orders directly from Michael. In contrast, since Pentangeli was a capo, there is no insulation between Michael and himself. The Senate subcommittee and the FBI thus consider Pentangeli very credible, and are certain that he can corroborate Cicci's testimony and charge Michael with perjury. While the Committee is in recess, Michael and others look for a way to avoid the perjury charges. Fredo, who had unknowingly conspired with Michael's enemies, informs Michael that the hearing was engineered by Roth as part of his plan to eliminate him from the scene; plus, the committee's lawyer is on Roth's payroll. Michael knows that Pentangeli's protective custody is too secure to make an attempt on his life before he testifies. Instead, Michael flies Pentangeli's brother, Vincenzo, in from Sicily, and Vincenzo accompanies Michael to the hearing at which Frank is scheduled to testify. Vincenzo and Frank exchange a silent glance before the hearing. Frightened, Frank recants his earlier statements, saying he \\"told the FBI guys what they wanted to hear,\\" and now claims that the Corleone family is innocent of any wrongdoing, thus perjuring himself before the Senate committee. This testimony catches the committee completely off-guard and effectively derails the government's case against Michael. After the hearing, Corleone family consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) visits Pentangeli in custody. Hagen tells Pentangeli, a history buff, a story about how traitors in ancient Rome could spare their families if they committed suicide; the implication being that Michael will take care of Pentangeli's family if he kills himself. Pentangeli thanks Hagen, returns to his assigned quarters, and slits his wrists while taking a bath. The finished film leaves unclear exactly what about his brother's presence motivated Pentangeli to change his story. The final film only states that Vincenzo is a powerful and ruthless Mafia chieftain in Sicily.Puzo, Mario and Coppola, Francis Ford. (1973, September 24). THE GODFATHER Part Two, The Internet Movie Script Database \\"PENTANGELI: Did my brother go back? HAGEN: Yeah, but don't worry. PENTANGELI: He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned. HAGEN: Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home. PENTANGELI: That's my brother. Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he coulda had his own Family.\\" An early draft of the film's script explains that Vincenzo, shocked that his brother is about to betray the Corleones, attends the hearing to remind Frank that he must not break the Mafia's code of silence, omert√†. This is also spelled out in a cut scene in the Godfather II video game for the Xbox 360. His brother's presence, as well as the stare they exchange, serves as a threat that if Frank follows through with his planned testimony, retribution will be taken against his children, who are living in Sicily under Vincenzo's guardianship.Puzo, Mario and Coppola, Francis Ford. (1973, September 24). THE GODFATHER Part Two, The Internet Movie Script Database \\"MICHAEL: He said his girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her. He set her up in a house in Jersey. She had to be faithful and she had to have kids. And she did. Two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life. She begged him to let her go. He did. He gave her money and made her give up the kids. Then Frankie took them to Italy and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd be safe. (Kay begins to realize.)

Honor, silence.\\" In popular culture This character made the national news on January 25, 2019, because he was referenced in the federal indictment of Roger Stone. Stone was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and charged with seven counts through an indictment in the Mueller investigation; one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering. \\"The indictment contains a reference to a character from 'The Godfather: Part II' who is intimidated into not testifying against a mafia boss. According to the indictment, Stone in late 2017 told an associate ‚Äî identified as \\"Person 2\\" ‚Äî that they should \\"do a 'Frank Pentangeli' before [the House Intelligence Committee] in order to avoid contradicting Stone's testimony.' The filing goes on to say, \\"Frank Pentangeli is a character in the film The Godfather: Part II, which both Stone and Person 2 had discussed, who testifies before a congressional committee and in that testimony claims not to know critical information that he does in fact know.\\" Stone's trial began on November 6, 2019. Randy Credico, a comedian and associate of Stone's testified that he refused to testify to Congress, \\"taking the Fifth\\", partly due to pressure from Stone. Stone's abusive texts to Credico were read out in court in which Stone called Credico a \\"maggot\\", a \\"rat\\", a \\"stoolie\\" and a \\"disloyal fuck\\", encouraging Credico to tell Mueller to \\"go fuck himself\\" and threatening to take the comedian's dog away (Credico relies on a medical support dog). On November 15, Stone was found guilty on all seven counts, obstruction of proceedings, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering.

He was executed for his part in Robert Emmet's rebellion in 1803. Background Born in Dromahane, County Cork to an Anglican family, he joined the British army in 1783 and served in India. He returned to Ireland in 1786 and commenced studies in science, philosophy and politics. in July 1790 he met Theobald Wolfe Tone in the visitors' gallery in the Irish House of Commons and they became firm friends. Russell in Belfast In 1790 Russell resumed his military career as an officer in Belfast. With its thriving linen and textile industries and mercantile community, Belfast was called the \\"Athens of the North.\\" As an officer of the garrison, Russell had access to the newly emerging professional and business class, many of whose members were radicals (being Presbyterians) excluded from the Ascendancy. The French Revolution in 1789 was warmly greeted in Belfast as were its ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. With his keen mind and radical ideas, Russell soon became a confidante of Henry Joy McCracken, James Hope, Samuel Neilson and others who were to play a prominent role in the United Irish movement. With them he developed ideas of parliamentary reform, to include the bulk of the people, and Catholic emancipation. Russell left the army in July 1791 and attended a convention of the Whig Club in Belfast to mark Bastille Day. The convention was addressed by William Drennan, who proposed a brotherhood that would \\"go further than speculate or debate ‚Ä¶ and come to grips with practicalities\\", promoting separation from England and co-operation with the increasingly radical Catholic Committee in the pursuit of political and social reforms. However, Russell noted the lack of trust between Dissenters and Catholics which was due to fears that Catholic radicalism could be bought off by religious concessions. Informing Wolfe Tone of his observations, who within weeks published his \\"Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland\\" to address these suspicions. The pamphlet was extremely well received and provided the impetus for the founding of the Society of United Irishmen in Belfast on 18 October 1791 whose initial aims were constitutional reform, union among the Irish people and the removal of all religious disqualifications. Information at Down County Museum, Downpatrick, County Down, August 2009 United Irishman and reformer In 1790, Russell took the post of librarian at the Belfast Society for Promoting Knowledge, later to become the Linen Hall Library. His position as librarian allowed Russell to continue to develop ideas for the emancipation of the Irish people although by now the British authorities in Dublin were becoming increasingly aware of his and others activities and beliefs. Pressure from Dublin Castle would later force the United Irish movement to become a clandestine organisation as the would-be revolutionaries sought to continue their slow progress towards challenging the occupying British. In 1795 Russell, Andrew henderson, Henry Joy McCracken and Samuel Neilson as they led a band of United Irishmen to the top of Cavehill overlooking the town of Belfast where they swore an oath \\"never to desist in our effort until we had subverted the authority of England over our country and asserted her independence\\" prior to Wolfe Tone's exile to America. The event was noted in Dublin Castle although there was to be no immediate move to disband or arrest the members of the United Irishmen. In 1796, Russell published an ambitious and far-sighted document, Letter to the People of Ireland, which laid out his vision of social and economic reform for the Irish nation. In addition to his stance on religious freedom, he had made clear his anti-slavery views, in the Northern Star on 17 March 1792 whose editorial comment took a less generous view by agreeing with Russell but pointing out the immediate necessity to liberate three million slaves in Ireland. The veteran anti-slavery campaigner, Mary Ann McCracken, sister of [liam weber Henry Joy , remembered that as a young officer in Belfast Russell had ' abstained from the use of slave labour produce until slavery in the West Indies was abolished, and at the dinner parties to which he was so often invited and when confectionery was so much used he would not take anything with sugar in it . . .' State prisoner Russell took an active part in organising the Society of United Irishmen which spread rapidly assisted by their newspaper, the Northern Star , becoming the United Irish commander in County Down. However the outbreak of war with revolutionary France and England in 1793 had led to an ongoing campaign against the United Irishmen and in 1796 Russell was arrested and imprisoned as a \\"state prisoner\\" (i.e. held without trial) in Dublin missing out in participation in the 1798 rising as a result. In March 1799 he, and the other state prisoners were transferred to Fort George in Scotland, an extensive fortress some miles north of Inverness built in the wake of the failed Jacobite rebellion of 1745-46. He was released on condition of exile to Hamburg in June 1802 following a brief cessation in the war with France. Russell and Emmett Not content to sit things out in Hamburg, Russell soon made his way to Paris where he met Robert Emmet who was planning another insurrection pending the French renewal of the war against England. Russell agreed to return to Ireland in March 1803 to organise the North in conjunction with the veteran of the battle of Antrim, James Hope. However he met with little success as much of the north was subdued following the suppression of the 1798 rebellion and displayed little appetite for a renewed outbreak. Finally finding some support in the vicinity of Loughinisland, Russell prepared to take to the field on 23 July 1803, the date set by Emmett. However the plan was badly thought out and quickly collapsed forcing Russell to flee to Dublin before a shot was fired in anger. Russell managed to hide for a number of weeks but Dublin was a bad place to hide in the days following the failure of Emmett's rebellion as the shocked authorities had launched a massive campaign of raids and arrests in an effort to finally eradicate the United Irishmen. He was promptly arrested and sent to Downpatrick Gaol where he was executed by hanging then beheaded on 21 October 1803.

It is made of flour, eggs, yeast, sugar and salt.\\"Pandesal.\\" Pinoyslang.com . Accessed July 2011. Description Pan de sal is a popular yeast-raised bread in the Philippines. Individual loaves are shaped by rolling the dough into long logs (bast√≥n, Spanish for \\"stick\\") which are rolled in fine bread crumbs. These are then portioned, allowed to rise, and baked. It is most commonly served hot and may be eaten as is, or dipped in coffee, tsokolate (hot chocolate), or milk. It can also be complemented with butter, margarine, cheese, jam, peanut butter, chocolate spread, or other fillings like eggs, sardines and meat. Its taste and texture closely resemble those of the Puerto Rican bread pan de agua, French baguette, and Mexican bolillos. Contrary to its name, pan de sal tastes slightly sweet rather than salty. Most bakeries bake pandesal in the morning for breakfast consumption, though some bake pandesal the whole day.applepiepatispate.com Variants A soft yellowish version of pandesal that uses butter or margarine is known as Spanish bread. This variant commonly has sweet fillings. Some pandesal in supermarkets and in some bakeries are less crusty and lighter in color. They also tend to have more sugar than the traditional pandesal which only has 1.75% sugar. In Siargao Island, famous as a surfing location, an elongated oval-shaped version of the pandesal is locally known as \\"pan de surf\\" due to the similarity of its shape to a surfboard. It is baked on makeshift ovens fueled with coconut husks and usually sold with pan de coco. Dried and ground- up malunggay or moringa leaves are sometimes added to the flour for additional nutritional content; this is called \\"malunggay pandesal\\". A popular new variant of pandesal is ube cheese pandesal which is made with purple yam (ube) with cheese filling. It is characteristically purple like all ube dishes. Other cotemporary variants include addition of chocolate, matcha, strawberry and blueberry flavors. History The precursor of pan de sal was pan de suelo (\\"floor bread\\"), a local Spanish-Filipino version of the French baguette baked directly on the floor of a wood-fired oven (a pugon). It was made with wheat flour and was harder and crustier than pan de sal. Since wheat is not natively produced in the Philippines, bakers eventually switched to more affordable inferior flour resulting in the softer, doughy texture of pan de sal. Pan de sal flourished during the American colonial era in the early 1900s, when cheaper American wheat became more readily available. It has since become a staple breakfast bread in the Philippines. Baking of pandesal in pugon declined due to a ban on cutting mangrove trees for fuel and bakers shifted into using gas ovens.

According to the historian Pierre Silli√®res, who has supervised excavation of Roman sites in Spain to identify the exact route followed by the Via Augusta, it was more a system of roads than a single road. Approximately long, the Via Augusta was built to link Spain with Italy, running from the interior city of Gades (C√°diz) to the Pyrenees Mountains along inland valleys parallel to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. As the main axis of the road network in Roman Hispania, it appears in ancient sources such as the itinerary inscribed on the Vicarello Cups as well in as the Antonine Itinerary. The highway was named after the emperor Augustus, who ordered reconstruction of the previously existing Via Herculea (or Via Heraklea), which ran from the Pyrenees to Carthago Nova, and extension of the arterial roadway as far as Gades. The works were carried out between 8 BC and 2 BC, taking advantage of what remained of roads that had existed in the time of the Roman Republic. Subsequently it became an important communications and trade route between the cities and provinces and the ports of the Mediterranean. The Via Augusta was still used by the Muslim occupiers of southern Spain in the 10th century, who called it al-Racif. Its route is currently followed by the N-340 road and the A-7 highway. North of Tarragona there remains a Roman Triumphal arch, the Arc de Ber√†, around which the road divides. At Martorell, the ancient Via crosses the river Llobregat on the Pont del Diable, which dates from the High Middle Ages (circa 1289) in its current form. At present, the N-IV N-420, N-340 and the Mediterranean Highway ( A-7, AP-7, A-70 ) follow the same itinerary in many sections as the V√≠a Augusta. In some sections of the current N-340, the Roman road was used until the 1920s, when they were paved during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Background information The Roman Empire built roads extending to its far corners; once the Romans had conquered Hispania they began to build roads there as in their other territories. Hispania, the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula, included what is now Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and the southernmost part of France.Simon Keay, ‚ÄúRecent Archaeological Work in Roman Iberia‚Äù, The Journal of Roman Studies, 93 (2003): 146. When Augustus went to Spain between 16 and 13 BC, he saw the need for roads and ordered the construction of the Via Augusta, the longest and most important road in Hispania.S. J. Keay, Roman Spain, (California: University of California Press, 1988) 49.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 10, ed. by Alan K. B, Edward C., Andrew L. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996) 454. The road passed from near the southern tip of present-day Spain on the Atlantic to the Mediterranean through the Guadalquivir valley and along the coast to the Coll de Pert√∫s (Latin: \\"Pertusium\\") pass in the Pyrenees.Karen Eva Carr, Vandals to Visigoths: Rural Settlement Patterns in Early Medieval Spain, (Chicago: University of Michigan Press, 2002), 146. The Via Augusta linked Hispania Baetica in the south with the north of Hispania. The still extant Alcantarilla bridge, a double arched stone bridge over the River Salado in Utrera, about south of Seville, has an inscription on the cutwater of one of its pilings indicating that it was on the Via Augusta. The Romans built a fifteen-arched bridge over the River Baetis (the Guadalquivir) at And√∫jar on the Augustan road. In the second half of the 1st century, with the social stability brought by the Pax Romana, the Roman city of Carmo, now Carmona, became a major crossroads on the Via Augusta and an important outpost in the Roman empire. Several cities have traces of the roadbed, which roughly follows that of the current AP-7 motorway. There is a fairly long visible stretch in the municipality of El Perell√≥, in the province of Tarragona. The Arc de Ber√† is located on the section that passed just south of the city. The strategic position of Roman Barcelona (Barcino) on a spur road of the Via Augusta allowed the city's commercial and economic development.Avienus, Or. Mar. 520: Et Barcilonum aoena sedes ditium.) In Barcelona, the ancient Via Augusta corresponds to one of the main avenues, also called \\"Via Augusta\\", in the Sarri√°-San Gervasio district, which connects the Avinguda Diagonal with the Vallvidrera tunnels, passing through Plaza Molina. A large part of line 6 of the Generalitat of Catalonia Railways passes underneath the Via Augusta roadbed.. Arch of Cabanes The Roman Arch of Cabanes, in the flat area known as Pla de l'arc, northwest of Castell√≥n in the Valencian Country, crosses the Via Augusta, which followed the inland valley in the province. This arch is now located in a roundabout of the CV-157 that still retains a certain resemblance to the appearance of the ancient Roman roads due to the rows of trees lining both sides of the highway, although the original route of the Via Augusta, which today is marked in many regions as a livestock route, does not always coincide with the current roads. However, the CV-157 road does not follow the southwest-northeast orientation that the Via Augusta followed in almost all its route, but rather west-east. This is because, as in other regions of Spain (e.g., Barcelona, Cabanes, and Tarragona), the Via Augusta crossed sparsely populated areas, generally along interior valleys parallel to the coast, so that almost all the Roman cities, especially those on the coast, were reached by secondary roads perpendicular to the Via Augusta. Branches used for military purposes also ran to the interior. The Via Augusta is documented and referenced in two central places in Valencia: the first is next to the Valencia Cathedral in the Almoina Archaeological Centre, which houses archaeological excavations made between 1985 and 2005 that revealed stratigraphic layers representing successive eras of the city's history, and the second place is next to the old Palace of the Borgias, now the Valencian Parliament. A few tens of metres of the pavement of the road can be found in the Almoina Museum, as well as remains of six Corinthian Order columns of the Temple of the Nymphs (Templo de las Ninfas) from the same period,a stone well, and remains of Visigothic and Arab houses. There are also milestones in San Vicente street (the city exit to the south) and in the Alameda de Valencia (the city esplanade). The San Vicente Ferrer Column of Caesar Augustus The city of Lorca (known as Eliocroca in Roman times) in the province of Murcia has several vestiges of the Via Augusta, including two Roman columns, the San Vicente Ferrer and the Baldazos milestones (La Hoya), respectively, of Emperor Augustus (8‚Äì7 BC) and Emperor Constantius Chlorus, preserved in the Archaeological Museum of Lorca (Museo Arqueol√≥gico de Lorca). The milestone of Constantius Chlorus was found in 1929 at Baldazos, in the Diputaci√≥n of La Hoya, six km from Lorca. During Roman times this hamlet was a mansus,Latin: from mansus (the perfect passive participle of manere, 'to remain\\" or \\"to stay\\"), an official stopping place on a road, maintained by the central government for the use of officials and those on official business whilst travelling. or official stopping place. Another milestone, the El Hornillo milestone, was found by a citizen on 5 February 2013 in the course of the River Guadalent√≠n, upstream from Lorca; Like the San Vicente Ferrer column, this column dates to the reign of Caesar Augustus; it is currently on display in the vestibule of the Museo Arqueol√≥gico de Lorca (MUAL). The Column of San Vicente Ferrer, dating to the reign of Caesar Augustus (CIL II 4937) is inscribed: This is the abbreviated form of: The inscription translated to English reads: History The Via Augusta was the great imperial road of Spain, and as a continuation of the Vias Julia Augusta, Aemilia, and Flaminia, it formed a major link in a chain of roads connecting Rome with the Atlantic Ocean. Its usage allowed the development of cities such as Valentia (Valencia), Saguntum (Sagunto), Lucentum (Alicante), Saetabis (X√†tiva), and Ilici (Elche). The Roman road engineers naturally considered the surrounding environment and the slope of the land when determining the course of the road, taking into account the existing old Iberian roads as well. The average width was between four and six metres, although there are some sections that were ten or fourteen metres wide. The sidewalks (margines or crepidines), built only near the cities, were between three and ten metres wide on each side. Starting from Coll de Pert√∫s pass in the Pyrenees, the Via Augusta ran south and southwest to the upper reaches of the River Baetis, and from that area on through Baetica to Gades. From the point where the road crossed the Baetis, however, a new system began. The river in that region formed the boundary between Baetica and Tarraconensis, and there a bridge with an arch, the Ianus Augusti, was erected in honor of Augustus. From this arch all the rest of the milestones on the way to Gades were numbered. Milestones were placed on the edge of Roman roads to indicate distances between capitas (starting points), at a distance of a thousand paces between the milestones (a pace was a Roman double step called a mille passum) equivalent to a Roman mile, i.e., 1.480 metres, hence its name. The milestones were cylindrical stone columns of granite or sandstone between 2 and 3 metres high and 50 to 80 cm in diameter, set on a square base. They were inscribed with information referring to the road: the name of the builder or restorer, the name of the nearest station and the distance, and sometimes the point of departure (caput viae) or of arrival (terminus viae). =Construction of the road network= Administrative divisions of Hispania in 17 BC with the capital of each province and of each conventus The construction of the Via Augusta was undertaken within the context of the administrative reorganisation of the provinces of Hispania initiated by Augustus. The immediate precedent of this roadbuilding project was the network of roads, the Via Agrippa, built in Gaul under the supervision of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa at Augustus' command in 20-19 BC. Strabo (IV, 6, 11) alludes to Agrippa's laying out of the roadways. Agrippa then went to Hispania in 19-18 BC to personally direct the war against the Cantabrians in the north of the peninsula; Augustus himself returned to Hispania and remained for a period between 16-13 BC doing administrative work. He and his advisors set about devising an ambitious programme to restructure the administration of the territory, its primary objectives being the establishment of new cities, the construction of roads connecting them, and the distribution of large areas of land to be parcelled out among veteran professional soldiers. With the complete subjugation of Hispania, Augustus determined to lay out a proper road system like that which Agrippa had built in Gaul, and the basic network appears to have been completed in his reign. He repaired and relaid the coastal road from Tarraco (the imperial headquarters during his residence, Augustus made it the capital of Hispania Tarraconensis), through Valentia to Carthago Nova (Cartagena), as well as the road through the Baetis valley by way of Corduba and Hispalis to Gades itself, and in this section a large number of milestones bearing his name have been found. The isolation of Hispania from the rest of the Mediterranean world was a circumstance addressed by the building of Augustus' road network. The itineraries and milestones, as well as traces of the ancient roads, suggest that this was an intensive project. There were four important routes between the conventus capitals of Bracara Augusta (Braga) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga), the third hub of the system being the conventus capital Lucus Augusti (Lugo). Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza) and Carthago Nova were conventus capital cities that were also crossroads and the terminuses (capita) of roads. Augustus ordered the building of the road from Caesaraugusta to Tarragona, passing through Ilerda (Lerida) and Huesca. Domitian extended the road from Caesaraugusta to Olispo (Lisbon), by way of Toletum (Toledo) and Augusta Emerita. The latter city was the starting point of the road (later the so-called \\"silver way\\"), which passed northward through Salamanca to Oceloduri. There it met the road following the course of the Ebro and then into the region of north-central Hispania. Asturica Augusta, the terminus of the \\"silver route\\", was an important junction, where the highways to Lusitania and the Cantabrian coast intersected. It later became the celebrated pilgrimage road to Santiago de Compostela. In the south, Emerita and Gades were connected by the Hispalis road. In Hispalis the road joined the branch of the Via Augusta which started in Acci ((also Accitum) and veered inland to Corduba, Astigi (√âcija), and Carmo. This was the main layout of the Roman road system in Hispania; together with the network of localised roads, they covered about . Milestones indicate the roads laid out by Augustus from Bracara to Asturica through Lucus Augusti, from Caesaraugusta to Juliobriga (Reinosa), from Emerita (M√©rida) to Hispalis (Seville), penetrating the rich mining district of the Montes Mariani, and from Carthago Nova to Castulo (Cazorla), another mining region. There was a road built by him from Ilerda to Caesaraugusta, crossing the Ebro by a wooden bridge according to Strabo, and apparently one from Aesuris to Pax Julia, up the course of the river Anas. Augustus had surrounded Hispania with a great circle of roads, with one or two branches reaching inland. In contrast to Gaul, where Agrippa had laid out four or five roads radiating from a central hub, here there was the perimeter of a wheel, so to speak, and it was the task of succeeding emperors to fill in the spokes and build more direct cross- country routes. The Via Augusta was originally a via miltaris, i.e., a military road built by legionaries of the Roman army; these units constructed a substantial part of the road network, especially at the beginning of the empire. These roads remained strategically important, but their main purpose was for general communications, as shown by an inscription on a fragmentary milestone found near Corduba (C√≥rdoba). Here, in the year 90, Domitian ordered the restoration of the Via Augusta, which had fallen into disrepair. This section of the road was designated a via miltaris, according to the inscription: In English:  Cities through which the Via Augusta passed Traces of the road in ancient Gades (C√°diz) * Gades (C√°diz) * Ad Portus (El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a) * Asta Regia (Jerez de la Frontera (Mesas de Asta)) * Ugia (Torre Alocaz), Utrera * Orippo (Dos Hermanas) * Hispalis (Seville) * Carmona (Carmona) * Obucla u Ob√∫lcula Fuentes de Andaluc√≠a (La Monclova)) * Colonia Augusta Firma Astigi (√âcija) * Adaras La Carlota * Corduba (C√≥rdoba) * Iliturgi (Meng√≠bar, where it crossed the Betis River on the Bridge of And√∫jar (Guadalquivir) * Isturgi (And√∫jar) * Castulo (Linares) * Mentesa Oretana (Villanueva de la Fuente) * Saltigi (Chinchilla de Monte-Arag√≥n) * Libisosa (Lezuza) * Ad Ello (Elda) * Carthago Nova (Cartagena) * Eliocroca (Lorca) * Sucro (Albalat de la Ribera) * Saetabis (X√†tiva) * Valentia (Valencia) * Saguntum (Sagunt) * Intybilis (La Jana) * Dertosa (Tortosa) * Tarraco (Tarragona) * Aquis Vocontis (Caldes de Malavella) * Gerunda (Girona) * Narbo Martius (Narbonne), France References Augusta, Via Category:0s BC establishments Category:Augustus ","title":"Via Augusta"},{"id":"4878814","text":"' (\\"double-mercenaries\\", \\"double-pay men\\", from German doppel- meaning double, Sold meaning pay) were Landsknechte in 16th-century Germany who volunteered to fight in the front line, taking on extra risk, in exchange for double payment.

Personal life and Knob Hill Farms Born in the village of Gavros (ŒìŒ¨Œ≤œÅŒøœÇ),http://ellinika- xwria.blogspot.gr/2015/09/blog-post_808.html near Kastoria in Greece,http://macedoniantoronto.blogspot.ca/2009/12/test.html Stavro immigrated to Toronto with his family when he was seven years old to join his father, who had come to Canada in 1927. He attended Duke of Connaught Public School, where he was given the name Steve, and Riverdale Collegiate Institute. He worked in his father's grocery store, Louis Meat Market, at Queen Street and Coxwell Avenue and left school after Grade 10 to work full-time. In 1951, he and his family opened a new store across the street under the Knob Hill Farms name. Stavro said he took the name off a box of produce from California, although Knob Hill was also the name of a community in Scarborough, Ontario. By 1954, he was running his own grocery store at 425 Danforth Avenue while his older brother, Chris Stavro, managed the original store. By the late 1950s, Stavro was operating nine grocery stores and outdoor markets in Toronto. His father was diagnosed with cancer in 1956 and died in 1960. In December 1963, Stavro opened his first food \\"terminal\\"‚Äîa forerunner of the big-box store‚Äîwhich featured low prices and no-frills service. It was located at Woodbine Road and Highway 7 in Markham, Ontario. Eight years later, he opened a second terminal in Pickering, Ontario. A terminal at Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street West in Toronto opened in 1975. Through the years, he opened nine terminals in the Greater Toronto Area and a outlet in Cambridge, Ontario, which opened in 1991, billed as the world's largest grocery store. In 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. At the time, he was said to own a manor house on in Campbellcroft, Ontario, a 49-room mansion on Teddington Park in Toronto, a palatial mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, at Holland Marsh, and a farm in Kentucky. All Knob Hill Farms stores were shut down in 2000 with the last one closing in 2001. In 2006, Stavro died in his home at age 78 after a heart attack. He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery where he had built a tomb adorned with icons of many of his achievements including the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, Order of Canada, Knights of Malta, Order of the Masons and an equestrian statue of Alexander the Great. Stavro and soccer In 1966 Stavro helped form the United Soccer Association and entered a team called Toronto City in the new league. The USA originally intended to launch its league in the spring of 1968, but a rival league, the National Professional Soccer League, announced it was ready to launch in 1967. Not wanting to lose ground to its rival, the USA decided to fast track its launch. Without any players of its own, it opted to import whole teams from Europe and South America, which would represent the franchises during the inaugural season, giving them time to build their own squads for the following season. Toronto City was represented by Hibernian of the Scottish Football League. In December 1967 the USA and the NPSL merged to form the North American Soccer League. As a result of this merger some of the USA franchises, including Toronto City folded, in part to avoid cities having more than one club in the new league with City losing out to its NPSL rival Toronto Falcons. Stavro sold his team back to the league for $160,000. Knob Hill Stable Steve Stavro became a racehorse owner in 1965, buying three yearlings in partnership with lawyer Joe Kane. Kane got out of the business, and Stavro continued racing and breeding and as the owner of Knob Hill Stable based in Newmarket, Ontario, enjoyed considerable success. He usually named his horses after famous Macedonian heroes and battles.https://web.archive.org/web/20071023053335/http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2006/04/24/stavroobit-060424.html In 1988, Stavros acquired a farm in Kentucky that was used to train his horses during the winter. Stavro was a member of the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society and the Jockey Club of Canada. In 2006, he was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame as a builder of the sport. Toronto Maple Leafs ‚Äì Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment A long-time friend of Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, Stavro had served as a director of Maple Leaf Gardens since 1981, and he, Don Giffin, and Don Crump served as the executors of the Ballard estate following the latter's death. Stavro became chairman of the board of Maple Leaf Gardens and governor of the Maple Leafs in October 1991 following Ballard's death. That year, Stavro paid off a $20 million loan that had been made to Ballard in 1980 by Molson, who also owned the Leafs' bitter rivals, the Montreal Canadiens. In return, he was given an option to buy Maple Leaf Gardens shares from Ballard's estate. Molson also agreed to sell its stake in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to Stavro. That deal closed in 1994, and shortly after Stavro bought Ballard's shares from the estate for $34 a share or $75 million.Date-by-date story of Gardens takeover fight,\\" Hamilton Spectator, November 11, 1994, p. C15 The purchase was the subject of a securities commission review and a lawsuit from Ballard's son Bill, but the deal stood. In contrast to Ballard, Stavro was a somewhat reclusive man who hated the spotlight, and largely left the Maple Leafs in the hands of the hockey operations staff. The first period of success was led by general manager Cliff Fletcher. In 1992‚Äì93, the Maple Leafs had their first winning season in 14 years, coming within one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, and again made the Conference Finals the following season. During the tenure of head coach and general manager Pat Quinn from 1999 to 2002, the team was an annual contender, clinching a Northeast Division title, the first two 100-point seasons in franchise history, and two Eastern Conference Finals appearances. However, Stavro's legacy was somewhat tainted when he vetoed the Fletcher deal for Wayne Gretzky. Said Gretzky, \\"Toronto was my first choice. It was really where I wanted to go. But Cliff came back and said he had taken it to the owner, and the owner nixed it.\\" Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited was renamed Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment in 1996, with the acquisition of the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association after establishing a partnership with Larry Tanenbaum. The partnership enabled the Leafs and Raptors to share the new Air Canada Centre rather than building two separate venues. However, Stavro and Tanenbaum were said to have a poor relationship, as Tanenbaum disputed a report that claimed that Stavro saw him as a favored son. A Globe and Mail Report on Business magazine article also alleged that Stavro would worry about minute details such as hot dogs. The owners' lounge at the Air Canada Centre was modeled in a Scottish theme with dark wood panels while Stavro was chairman; his successor Tanenbaum had the room remodeled to a white modernistic style with some insiders saying that the change was made because the old room reminded him too much of Stavro. Stavro was also known in the local Macedonian community to have a friendly competition with fellow Macedonian Mike Ilitch who owned a rival NHL hockey team, the Detroit Red Wings. Stavro's Knob Hill Farms sponsored a hockey team in the Metro Junior A League in the 1962‚Äì63 season. The team and the league folded after the end of the season. Stavro stepped down as Chairman of MLSE in 2003 in favour of Tanenbaum, as part of a restructuring plan that also saw him sell his majority stake to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Jim Leech, OTTP Senior Vice President of Private Equity (also known as the Teachers' Merchant Bank), had orchestrated the deal after the closure of Stavro's Knob Hill Farms grocery chain, giving rise to rumours that the financial state of MLSE could also be affected. Stavro received a luxury box as part of the deal, which caused some controversy as several disabled season-ticket holders were displaced without notification.

G. Wodehouse, which was published in the United States in the July 1935 edition of Redbook, and in the United Kingdom in the December 1935 issue of the Strand. It was included in the collection Young Men in Spats (1936).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 70-71, A55. The story is part of the main Drones Club canon. It features club member Pongo Twistleton and his mischievous Uncle Fred. Pongo and Uncle Fred would go on to appear in four novels, including making two visits to Blandings Castle. In the story, Uncle Fred manages to gain access to a house to use as shelter after he and Pongo get caught in the rain. When relatives of the house's owner come to speak with him about a family drama concerning a young couple, Uncle Fred naturally involves himself in their affairs, leaving Pongo no choice but to play along. Plot At the Drones Club, a Crumpet and his guest see Pongo Twistleton looking distraught. The Crumpet explains that Pongo has learned his mischievous Uncle Fred, Lord Ickenham, is coming to London, and tells the following story about what happened the last time Uncle Fred came. Uncle Fred suggests to his nephew that they visit a suburb, Mitching Hill, formerly an estate owned by an uncle when he was younger. They go there, but get caught in a shower of rain and take shelter in a doorway. The door is opened by a maid, and Uncle Fred, finding the owners are away, gains access to the house by posing as someone come to clip the parrot's claws, with Pongo introduced as his assistant Mr Walkinshaw. The maid leaves on an errand, and Uncle Fred makes himself comfortable. A pink-faced man visits the house looking for Mr Roddis. Uncle Fred claims to be Mr Roddis and introduces Pongo as his son Douglas. The visitor is Wilberforce Robinson, an eel-jellier, who is in love with Roddis's wife's estranged sister Connie Parker's daughter Julia, but is disapproved of by the family as being beneath them socially. He has come to Mr Roddis for help. When Julia arrives with her parents, Uncle Fred suggests Robinson hide behind the sofa to avoid trouble. The Parkers enter, and Uncle Fred introduces Pongo as a deaf veterinarian attending to the parrot. Julia's parents tell the story of the eel-jellier wooing their daughter, and Julia insists she loves him, on which the man leaps from behind the couch and kisses her. Uncle Fred criticizes the Parkers' insistence that their family is superior to Robinson's by claiming that various cousins and uncles made their money in immoral and even criminal ways. Though Mrs Parker denies all, Robinson sees it as vindication of his own family background, and claims all he needs is a hundred pounds to buy a share in a business. Uncle Fred provides the money at once, and Robinson and Julia leave delighted. Uncle Fred and Pongo leave the Parkers drinking a reviving cup of tea after their bizarre ordeal, and in the street meet Mr Roddis, the owner of the house. Uncle Fred introduces himself as a neighbour Mr J. G. Bulstrode, and Pongo as his brother-in-law, Percy Frensham. He tells Roddis two people broke into his house, pointing through the window to the tea- drinking couple, and advises Roddis to call the police. Though Uncle Fred is pleased with his actions, Pongo is shaken by his uncle's mischief. Thus, concludes the Crumpet, is Pongo's demeanour - on hearing he has to face another visit from his uncle - explained. Style Wodehouse makes use of various stylistic devices in his stories to create humour. One of the devices Wodehouse employs is the pun, as in the following quote from \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\": > \\"It won't be long,\\" said the girl, \\"before Wilberforce suddenly rises in the > world.\\" > She never spoke a truer word. At this very moment, up he came from behind > the settee like a leaping salmon.Hall (1974) pp. 96‚Äì97. Background Wodehouse's childhood experiences in Victorian Croydon inspired Uncle Fred's memories from childhood of the fictional Mitching Hill, which Uncle Fred recalls was once open country before becoming a suburb.McCrum (2004), p. 19. Wodehouse was fond of parrots, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he kept pet parrots on and off. In addition to \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\", he included a parrot in the short story \\"Ukridge Rounds a Nasty Corner\\".McCrum (2004), p. 67.

Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire lost control over the major sections of Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria, each of which claimed Macedonia on historical or ethnical grounds. In the Treaty of San Stefano (1878), which terminated the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78, Bulgaria was awarded the lion's share of Macedonia. However, the settlement was nullified by the European powers in the same year (see Congress of Berlin), and Macedonia was left under direct Ottoman control. After the Greco-Turkish war of 1897, which proved a disaster for Greece, Bulgarian nationalism started strengthening in Macedonia. Thus it came about that on the feastday (20 July) of the Prophet Elijah in 1903 there was a Macedonian uprising, known as the Ilinden Uprising, which the Ottoman army soon suppressed. Greek Struggle for Macedonia The rising, however, made plain the danger that Macedonia might be lost for ever, which stimulated a general mobilisation on the part of the Greeks. So it came about, in 1904, that the armed Greek Struggle for Macedonia began, lasting until 1908. During this period, units made up of volunteers from the free Greek state, from Crete and from other areas poured into region of Macedonia in solidarity with the local Makedonom√°choi (, \\"Macedonian fighters\\"). Together, they confronted the Bulgarian forces in an attempt to assert hegemony over the central and southern parts of Macedonia. Balkan Wars Macedonia's division in 1913 Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913) The Balkan Wars (First and Second), of 1912‚Äì13 put an end to five centuries of Ottoman domination in Macedonia. =First Balkan War= The antagonisms between the Christian states (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria) still persisted, and after the successful conclusion of the First Balkan War, they resurfaced, especially over the partition of Macedonia. In Treaty of London, 1913 the allies (see:Balkan League) disagree about the division of Macedonia. =Second Balkan War= Greece and Serbia turned against Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War, and the Treaty of Bucharest (1913) left Bulgaria only a small share of Macedonia, the rest of which was divided roughly along the present lines. In 1913, following the Treaty of Bucharest, the region was divided among Greece, which took Greek Macedonia (composed from the Vilayets of Salonica, and Manastir); Serbia, which took Vardar Macedonia (today, the Republic of Macedonia); and the areas of Ottoman Kosovo that were part of the Macedonian region - today, South Kosovo. Bulgaria took what is now Blagoevgrad Province from the Salonica Vilayet. This was followed by massive population movements. Thousands of Macedonian Bulgarians fled to Bulgaria. World War I and National Schism Fighting along the Greek border in Macedonia, 1916 Venizelos was in support of the Allies and wanted Greece to join the war on their side, while the pro-German King wanted Greece to remain neutral, which would favor the plans of the Central Powers. The disagreement had wider implications, since it would also affect the character and role of the king in the state. The unconstitutional dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two and in subsequent events their followers divided into two radically opposed political camps affecting the wider Greek society. With the landing of Allied forces in Thessaloniki with Venizelos' permission and the unconditional surrender by the King of a military fort in Macedonia to German-Bulgarian forces, the disagreement of the two men started to take the form of civil war. In August 1916, followers of Venizelos set up a provisional state in Northern Greece with Entente support with the aim of reclaiming the lost regions in Macedonia, effectively splitting Greece into two entities. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an armed confrontation in Athens between Entente and royalist forces (an incident known as Noemvriana) the king abdicated, and his second son Alexander took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies, emerging victorious and securing new territory by the Treaty of S√®vres. Treaty of Lausanne (1923) Greek ethnographic map of south-eastern Balkans before the population exchanges, 1918 The Treaty of Lausanne (1923) put an end to the traditional Greek policy of the \\"Great Idea\\". This allowed the Greek governments of the inter-war years to turn their attention to the country's domestic affairs and to the building of the modern Greek state. The population exchanges among Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria after 1923 resulted in the replacement by Greek refugees from Asia Minor of most of the Slavic and Turkish elements in Macedonia. Macedonia experienced a radical demographic transformation with the arrival of the Greek refugees; the Greeks, who had been the 43% in 1913, were estimated to constitute 89% of the population of Macedonia by 1928. Bulgarian relations with Yugoslavia (before 1929 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) remained strained over the Macedonian question. Frontier incidents were frequent, as were Yugoslav charges against Bulgaria for fostering the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), a nationalist group that used violence, in Yugoslavia. Macedonian agitation against Serbian rule culminated (1934) in the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia by a Bulgarian nationalist at Marseilles. World War II Bulgarian occupation zone in Greece (in green) during World War II In World War II Thrace and eastern Macedonia were occupied (1941‚Äì44) by Bulgaria, which sided with the Axis Powers. The Bulgarian government maintained a course of military passivity until 20 April 1941, when German troops crushed Greece and Yugoslavia. In April 1941, the Bulgarian Army entered the Aegean region, hoping for gaining an Aegean Sea outlet in Thrace and Eastern Macedonia, and occupied a territory between the river Struma and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of Evros with the cities of Alexandroupoli (–î–µ–¥–µ–∞–≥–∞—á, Dedeagach), Komotini (–ì—é–º—é—Ä–¥–∂–∏–Ω–∞, Gyumyurdzhina), Serres (–°—è—Ä, Syar), Xanthi (–ö—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–∏), Drama (–î—Ä–∞–º–∞) and Kavala (–ö–∞–≤–∞–ª–∞) and the islands of Thasos and Samothrace. The so-called \\"Roman Legion\\" a collaborationist organization consisting of a few Vlachs supported the Italian occupation army between 1941‚Äì1943 in Thessaly, Pindus mountain and part of Epirus. The Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front or SNOF was a major force in Greek Macedonia. The Bulgarian armistice treaty of 1944 restored the pre-war boundaries, which were confirmed in the peace treaty of 1947. The Yugoslav constitution of 1946 declared Yugoslav Macedonia an autonomous unit and a federal state under the name Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The South Slavic people that formed the majority of the people in the new federal state, were recognized as a separate nationality, as Macedonians (ethnic group). The long lasting struggle of national recognition was given only from Yugoslavia, one of the four countries that had territories in the geographical region of Macedonia. In the following years, Albania granted the ethnic Macedonian minority rights and freedom, while Greece and Bulgaria, which saw Yugoslavia's action with suspicion and as an attempt to foster Yugoslav influence in the region of Macedonia, denied any rights to their Slavic-speaking minorities that have been associated with the Yugoslav Macedonia, and thus, kept them under a heavy assimilation processes. The struggle for human rights and freedom of the ethnic Macedonian people still continues. =Greek Civil War= Much of the Greek Civil War was fought in Macedonia. The Communist Party of Greece or KKE and the Democratic Army of Greece or DSE were heavily established in Macedonia. The National Liberation Front was established by Slavic speakers who associate themselves with Yugoslavia who resided in Greece, to assist with the war effort, in return for minority status recognition and rights. However, when the DSE lost the Greek Civil War thousands of people who fought for the Communist side fled Greece, taking thousands of ethnic Macedonian children from the Greek region of Macedonia with them.Simpson, Neil (1994). Macedonia Its Disputed History. Victoria: Aristoc Press, 101,102 & 91\\\\. Tension over the region of Macedonia continued in the early postwar years. During the Greek Civil War there was much conflict between Greece and Yugoslavia over Macedonia, and the breach between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria after 1948 helped to make the Macedonian question explosive. However, with the settlement of the civil war and with the easing of Yugoslav-Bulgarian relations after 1962, tension over Macedonia was reduced. A 1982 amnesty law stated \\"Free to return to Greece are all Greeks by Genus who during the civil war of 1946‚Äì1949 and because of it have fled abroad as political refugees, despite that Greek citizenship has been taken away from them\\" had the right as Greeks, to take back their Greek citizenship and return, including the Macedonian Greeks, but excluding those who identified as non-Greeks, who were mainly ethnic Macedonians. In 1990, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia elected its first non-Communist government and the following year declared its independence as the \\"Republic of Macedonia\\", sparking a dispute over the name Macedonia with neighbouring Greece.

The Scott connection evenly distributes a balanced load between the phases of the source. The Scott three-phase transformer was invented by a Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott in the late 1890s to bypass Thomas Edison's more expensive rotary converter and thereby permit two-phase generator plants to drive three-phase motors. Interconnection At the time of the invention, two-phase motor loads also existed and the Scott connection allowed connecting them to newer three-phase supplies with the currents equal on the three phases. This was valuable for getting equal voltage drop and thus feasible regulation of the voltage from the electric generator (the phases cannot be varied separately in a three-phase machine). Nikola Tesla's original polyphase power system was based on simple-to-build two-phase four-wire components. However, as transmission distances increased, the more transmission-line efficient three-phase system became more common. (Three phase power can be transmitted with only three wires, where the two-phase power systems required four wires, two per phase.) Both 2 œÜ and 3 œÜ components coexisted for a number of years and the Scott-T transformer connection allowed them to be interconnected. Technical details Standard Scott Connection 3 œÜ to 2 œÜ Assuming the desired voltage is the same on the two and three phase sides, the Scott-T transformer connection (shown right) consists of a centre-tapped 1:1 ratio main transformer, T1, and a /2(‚âà86.6%) ratio teaser transformer, T2. The centre-tapped side of T1 is connected between two of the phases on the three- phase side. Its centre tap then connects to one end of the lower turn count side of T2, the other end connects to the remaining phase. The other side of the transformers then connect directly to the two pairs of a two-phase four- wire system. =Unbalanced loads= Two-phase motors draw constant power, just as three-phase motors do, so a balanced two-phase load is converted to a balanced three-phase load. However if a two-phase load is not balanced (more power drawn from one phase than the other), no arrangement of transformers (including the Scott-T transformers) can restore balance: Unbalanced current on the two-phase side causes unbalanced current on the three-phase side. Since the typical two-phase load was a motor, the current in the two phases was presumed inherently equal during the Scott-T development. In modern times people have tried to revive the Scott connection as a way to power single- phase electric railways from three-phase Utility supplies. This will not result in balanced current on the three-phase side, as it is unlikely that two different railway sections, each connected as two-phase, will at all times conform to the Scott presumption of being equal. The instantaneous difference in loading on the two sections will be seen as an imbalance in the three-phase supply; there is no way to smooth it out with transformers. The cited article is a GE paper which points out that railway unbalance, even via Scott-T transformers, affects generators, the motors of other customers and presumably delta connected transformers. Even small unbalances can cause heating. However, because electric systems have grown larger over the 20th century, the paper suggests that the railways are now a tolerable load, provided one has a confirming system analysis. Scott-T transformers may not even be relevant, since direct line-to-line load connections may be sufficient. So this leaves a potential solution, but the single-phase load should then be viewed as being tolerated, not balanced. Allowing it also raises the question: ‚ÄúWhat if other customers asked for the same toleration?‚Äù =Back to back arrangement= Scott Connection 3 œÜ to 3 œÜ The Scott-T transformer connection may also be used in a back-to-back T-to-T arrangement for a three-phase to three-phase connection. This is a cost-saving in the lower-power transformers due to the two-coil T connected to a secondary two-coil T instead of the traditional three-coil primary to three-coil secondary transformer. In this arrangement the X0 neutral tap is part way up on the secondary teaser transformer (see right). The voltage stability of this T-to-T arrangement as compared to the traditional three-coil primary to three-coil secondary transformer is questioned, as the \\"per unit\\" impedance of the two windings (primary and secondary, respectively) are not the same in a T-to-T configuration, whereas the three windings (primary and secondary, respectively) are the same in a three transformer configuration, if the three transformers are identical. Three-phase to three-phase (also called \\"T-connected\\") distribution transformers are seeing increasing applications. The primary must be delta- connected (Œî), but the secondary may be either delta or \\"wye\\"-connected (Y), at the customer's option, with X0 providing the neutral for the \\"wye\\" case. Taps for either case are usually provided. The customary maximum capacity of such a distribution transformer is 333 kV A (a third of a megawatt).

The flow stress for a given material in continuum mechanics is dependent upon the temperature, T, true strain, \\\\epsilon, and strain rate, \\\\bar{\\\\epsilon}. Generally, above 0.5 Tm (the absolute melting temperature of an alloy) the plastic deformation mechanisms favour strain rate sensitivity whereas at room temperature metals are generally strain-dependent. Therefore, it can be written as some function of those properties: \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}=f(\\\\epsilon,\\\\bar{\\\\epsilon},T) The exact equation to represent flow stress is dependent upon the particular material and the plasticity model being used. Other models may also include the effects of strain gradients. It is the middle value between yield strength and ultimate strength of the metal as a function of strain, which, for some materials, can be expressed:Mikell P. Groover, 2007, \\"Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing; Materials, Processes, and Systems,\\" Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons Inc. :Yf = KŒµn * Yf = Flow stress, MPa * Œµ = True strain * K = Strength Coefficient, MPa * n = Strain hardening exponent Hence, Flow stress can also be defined as the stress required to sustain plastic deformation at a particular strain. The flow stress is a function of plastic strain. The following properties have an effect on flow stress: chemical composition, purity, crystal structure, phase constitution, exit microstructure, grain size, and heat treatment. The flow stress is an important parameter in the fatigue failure of ductile materials. Fatigue failure is caused by crack propagation in materials under a varying load, typically a cyclically varying load. The rate of crack propagation is inversely proportional to the flow stress of the material.

The village was founded by families of shepherds who come from Sandomil and Corgas (closest town and village respectively) looking for fertile territories near water. The first definitive fixation of people was in the 15th century, in the place known since the 18th century as Sazes Velho (‚ÄúOld Sazes‚Äù literally). In 1527 the village had 65 inhabitants. However, in the pursue of lands more near the water, it was founded the village of Sazes da Beira. We can't know the date of the foundation of its freguesia, existing however parochial registers since 1612, that makes us suppose that the parish should have been created in the second half of the 16th century. In 1731 its church is edified. Since its foundation, Sazes belonged to the concelho of Sandomil until 1855, date when it was extinct and Sazes changed to the concelho of Seia. Only between 1836-40 Sazes belonged to the concelho of Loriga. The biggest change in the village's social life come with the growing need of miners, especially for tungsten in the beginnings of the 20th century, which ended after World War II. The population was growing while the freguesia‚Äôs mines were explored. With the ending of the exportations of miners to Europe, the freguesia‚Äôs economy started to decline.

She sang at the start of regular broadcasts of the BBC Television Service on 2 November 1936. After an early start as a child actress, and training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she became a member of the Old Vic, from 1928 to 1930, appearing in a wide range of roles, predominantly in Shakespeare's plays, but also those of Sheridan, Moli√®re and Shaw. Her performance in her first singing role so impressed the composer Richard Addinsell, that he secured her the leading role in the West End adaptation of Priestley's The Good Companions in 1931. After she left the Old Vic in 1930, Dixon played occasionally in non-musical plays, but, in general, her career was on the musical stage, starring in shows by Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Vivian Ellis and others. Later, she became well known for her appearances in pantomime. Her last appearance, before she retired, was in the West End musical Belinda Fair in 1949. Life and Career =Early Years= Dixon was born in London, a Cockney, the daughter of a coach maker, Frederick Dixon, and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Barrett) Dixon.Adele Dixon, The Times, 30 April 1992, p. 15 She studied at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts as a child, and was cast in her first professional part as the First Elf in Where the Rainbow Ends in December 1921. After further roles as a child actress, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where she studied for two years under the direction of Kenneth Barnes.Gaye, pp. 544‚Äì55 In her late teens, she was already playing leading adult parts, and, in 1927, she went on a tour to Egypt with Robert Atkins's company, playing Olivia in Twelfth Night, Jessica in The Merchant of Venice, Mariana in Measure for Measure and Bianca in Othello. In August 1928, Dixon married Ernest Schwaiger, a leading jeweller, their marriage lasting until his death in 1976. They had no children. The month after her wedding, Dixon joined the Old Vic company for two seasons. Her roles were mainly Shakespearean ‚Äì thirteen such, including Hecate in Macbeth (with John Laurie in the title role) in the first season, and Olivia to the Hamlet of the rising star John Gielgud in the second. She also played in works by Sheridan, Moli√®re and Shaw, but the role that shaped the course of her later career was her first singing part, the Sleeping Beauty, in Adam's Opera by Clemence Dane with music by Richard Addinsell. The piece was not especially well received, but the composer was impressed. After leaving the Old Vic Company in 1930, Dixon was cast at Addinsell's instigation in a West End musical role, JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted for the stage by the author and Edward Knoblock, with music by Addinsell. Dixon was given the starring female role, Susie, opposite Gielgud as Inigo. The piece ran for nearly a year in 1931 and 1932.Gielgud, p. 146 In 1931, Dixon made her first film, in the role of Consuelo Pratt in Uneasy Virtue. It was one of only two films she made in the 1930s, the other being Calling the Tune (1936), in which she played Julia Harbord. =1930s ‚Äì West End and Broadway= During the rest of the 1930s Dixon starred in the West End, and occasionally on tour, in a wide range of roles. For the most part she played in musicals, but an exception was Ian Hay's farce Orders is Orders in 1932. More characteristic were her singing roles in musical shows such as Wild Violets (1933), Give me a Ring by Guy Bolton and others (1933) and Oscar Hammerstein and Jerome Kern's Three Sisters (1934). In the last, the weak score and lyrics fatally damaged the show, despite the efforts of Stanley Holloway and other cast members; The Times observed, \\"Miss Adele Dixon unfailingly provides what the play chiefly lacks ‚Äì swiftness, economy and glamour.\\"Drury Lane\\", The Times, 10 April 1934, p. 12 In 1935, Dixon starred as Hope Harcourt in the London production of Cole Porter's Anything Goes. The following year she was the first woman to perform on British television, singing a specially-commissioned song \\"Television\\" (or \\"Bringing Television to You\\") at the official launch of BBC television from Alexandra Palace on 2 November 1936. Although, dance band singer Helen McKay was the first singer on high-definition television in test transmissions to RadiOlypmia in August of that same year. Television as a medium did not greatly appeal to Dixon, and she let it be known that she much preferred the radio. In September 1936, she was one of the stars of the Stanley Lupino- Laddie Cliff West End musical comedy, Over She Goes at the Saville Theatre. Running 246 performances, it was a hit. it finally closing on 22 May 1937. Adele Dixon played the romantic role of Pamela and, with Eric Fawcett as her lover Lord Harry Drewsden, introduced the charming Fox Trot number, \\"I Breathe on Windows\\", (music by Billy Mayerl, lyrics by Desmond Carter and Frank Eyton). In the 1938 film version of Over She Goes, the number was done by Claire Luce and John Wood. At the start of regular broadcasts of the BBC Television Service on 2 November 1936, Dixon performed the song \\"Television\\" live on its launch programme, accompanied by the BBC Television Orchestra with conductor Hyam Greenbaum. In 1937, Dixon made her New York debut as Claudette in the Between the Devil by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz. Despite a starry cast ‚Äì Dixon's co-stars were Jack Buchanan and Evelyn Laye ‚Äì the piece ran for only 93 performances, from 22 December 1937 to 12 March 1938.Between the Devil details, Internet Broadway Database.

Returning to London, Dixon starred in The Fleet's Lit Up (1938), with a book by Guy Bolton, Fred Thompson and Bert Lee and music and lyrics by Vivian Ellis.Brown, Ivor. \\"The Fleet's Lit Up\\", The Observer, 21 August 1938, p. 11 This was her last show before the Second World War. =1940s and later years= In 1941, Dixon appeared with Robertson Hare and Alfred Drayton in the film of Ben Travers' Banana Ridge; she did not return to musicals until 1944. In the intervening years, she played a range of roles. Her straight parts included Portia in The Merchant of Venice (1942), and Irene in Eric Linklater's Crisis in Heaven (1944) directed by GieIgud, but, in the main, she was a pantomime star in the war years, appearing in London and the provinces. Dixon's last film was the 1947 drama Woman to Woman as Sylvia Anson to Douglass Montgomery's David Anson. In 1948, she appeared on Broadway again, together with Jack Buchanan. This time they played in Sacha Guitry's comedy Don't Listen Ladies!, which was no more successful than Between the Devil had been. The following year, she scored what The Times described as a major personal hit in the title role of her last West End musical, Belinda Fair by Eric Maschwitz and Jack Strachey. Dixon retired after the run of Belinda Fair. She and her husband were a devoted couple, and his death in 1976 was a blow from which she never wholly recovered. She died of pneumonia at the age of 83 in Manchester, on 11 April 1992.

Generally regarded as a mediocre artist, he is primarily remembered as the biographer of Michelangelo. Biography Title page of Vita di Michelagnolo Buonarroti written by Ascanio Condivi The son of Latino Condivi and Vitangela de' Ricci, Ascanio Condivi was a nobleman born in the town of Ripatransone in the Marche. He moved to Rome circa 1545, where he became an acquaintance of Michelangelo. In 1553 he published Vita di Michelagnolo ' Buonarroti, an authorised account of Michelangelo's life over which his subject had complete control. The Vita was partly a rebuttal of hostile rumours that were being perpetuated about the artist, namely that he was arrogant, avaricious, jealous of other artists, and reluctant to take on pupils. It also served to correct inaccuracies Michelangelo found in the fawning biography of him in Giorgio Vasari's Vite de' pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori (\\"Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects\\"), which was later revised considerably by Vasari in the wake of Condivi's biography. Condivi's Vita denies that Michelangelo was indebted to any other artist and claims that he was self-taught (he was in fact a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio). Also, much is made of his supposed descent from the Counts of Canossa, although this belief of Michelangelo's was utterly unfounded. Due to its literary qualities some scholars believe that the poet Annibale Caro had a hand in the writing of the Vita. After the publication of the Vita Condivi returned to Ripatransone, where he undertook civic duties, married, and devoted himself to painting religious subjects. One of these paintings, the unfinished and ambiguously themed Holy Family and other figures (now in the Casa Buonarroti, Florence), relied completely for its composition on a cartoon provided by Michelangelo. The cartoon, known as the Epifania as it was once erroneously believed to depict the Epiphany, is now housed in the British Museum, London. Condivi died on 10 December 1574, because of a sudden flood while fording the torrent , down the valley north of his birth town.

The Burgundian variant of script can be seen as the court script of the Dukes of Burgundy and was used to produce some of the most magnificent manuscripts of the 15th century. The early printers produced regional versions in type which were used especially to print texts in the vernacular languages, more rarely for Latin texts. The earliest bastarda type was produced by the German Gutenberg in 1454‚Äì55. The main variety was the one used in France, which was also found in Geneva, Antwerp and London. Another local variety was found in the Netherlands; Caxton's first types were a rather poor copy of this.

He is best known as the founder of Quepasa, the first Latin American online community to go public and trade on a stock exchange in the early dot-com internet era of the late 1990s. In 2012, Quepasa changed its corporate name to MeetMe and continued trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under ticker symbol . MeetMe subsequently acquired the Skout, if(we), Tagged, and hi5 social networks and internet brands. As of mid 2018, renamed parent company the Meet Group had a market value of about U.S. $300 million. Early life and education Peterson grew up in Santa Barbara, California. As a son of British mother and an American father, his paternal ancestors emigrated to Santa Barbara from Spain. Peterson was educated at public schools in the Santa Barbara area. He was raised next door to the director of the University of California, Santa Barbara computer laboratory, who introduced him to computer programming at an early age in 1978.\\"Death of a dot-com\\", by Jane Larson, The Arizona Republic, September 9, 2001, cover story In 2017, Peterson's life story was featured in a book written by motivational speaker Brian Tracy about entrepreneurs. Peterson spent much of his early childhood remotely connecting to the UCSB mainframe computers via terminal and modem. Through early access to technology, Peterson learned to make his own Unix and VMS based software applications on the campus PDP-11 and DEC VAX computer systems. In the early years of computing, the largely technical science of programming was a pastime overrun by the likes of college professors and engineers. To fit in, Peterson reportedly maintained an identity for login on the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory PDP-10, where he was known by his peers as \\"Dr. Jeffrey Peterson\\", at the age of eleven.\\"California Public Schools Forum\\" Volume 2: Microcomputers Graduate School of Education, UCSB, June 1987 (98 pgs.) In 1981, Peterson landed his first job, as a troubleshooter for a software company focused on Commodore computers. In 1983, he worked as a product tester for vintage hardware manufacturer LOBO Systems. During the mid-1980s, Peterson focused on the development of software for freely distributed bulletin board system and multi-user dungeon gaming applications. He was known among his colleagues as an expert at implementing customized kernel-level multitasking solutions, who regularly pushed early hardware beyond traditional limits. Peterson, already a seasoned assembly and C language developer in his early years, contributed heavily to the emerging F/OSS programming communities of the 1980s. He has published numerous texts, including articles on multiprocessing, quasi-empirical methods, and artificial intelligence. Peterson was ridiculed about his early programming years in a satirical article published by TheStreet.com in 2004. The article, which highlights Peterson's public biography as filled in a Quepasa proxy statement on April 23, 2004, was suspicious about believing that he was programming computers when he was ten years old. Nonetheless, Peterson is credited at this age as a contributor on the inside cover of a best selling microcomputer software book in 1983. Well acquainted with the college scene from his earlier programming years, Peterson worked as a disc jockey at UCSB college radio station KCSB-FM from 1986 to 1990.\\"La Cumbre\\" Yearbook, Volumes 67‚Äì68, Copyright 1987, 1988 ASUCSB During the late 1980s, Peterson held the position of \\"traffic manager\\" on the sixteen-member executive committee at college radio station KCSB-FM that gave both Jim Rome and Sean Hannity their first radio broadcasting jobs. Peterson dropped out of high school in 1988 at age 16, to pursue his career in investments. He continued postliminary studies in the areas of law and history. Career =Wall Street years= In 1989, Peterson started his first job at a Wall Street investment firm, Lehman Brothers, where he learned about the stock market. He would later pass the industry exams, becoming a stockbroker at age nineteen. After working for several Wall Street firms, he landed in the field of investment banking, where he gained experience in corporate finance. Peterson would go on to work with investment groups that financed hundreds of companies primarily through initial public offering transactions during the strong stock market conditions of the early 1990s. =Quepasa.com= Jeffrey Peterson and Quepasa spokesperson Gloria Estefan at the Miami Herald in 1999 In 1997, Peterson founded Quepasa.com, Inc..\\"Hispanic market one to lure\\" by Greg Farrell, USA Today, August 6, 1999https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1078099/0000950134-99-005667.txt Form S-1/A, quepasa.com, inc., June 24, 1999 The website was the first major online community to focus on United States Hispanic Internet users.

L√≥pez Jr. Notable investors in Mobile Corporation included the venture fund of the Silicon Valley based Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati law firm, Salt Lake City businessman Phil Marriott, Texas land Commissioner George P. Bush, and Prorsus Capital. Mobile established a headquarters office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the company began developing branch offices at Plaza Carso in Mexico City, in Nogales, Sonora Mexico, and in the Philippines. In August 2014, Mobile Corporation announced that \\"working together with its investor and intellectual property partner\\" it had acquired the internet domain name Mobile.co, at $239,000, the second largest \\".co\\" domain sale in history at the time, after Overstock.com (o.co) at $350,000. The Mobile.co domain acquisition, performed by Peterson's investment company, gave rise to complex litigation including a highly publicized UDRP dispute. In an interview, Peterson stated that the original purchase price of the Mobile.co internet domain was $50,000, but the domain seller refused to complete the transfer after he learned who Peterson was, and instead demanded more money. When the UDRP dispute failed, Peterson initiated litigation in federal court and several international venues to secure the domain transfer. The litigation was followed by technology press and domain industry blogs. Shortly after the successful acquisition of Mobile.co, Peterson announced \\"we have acquired over 30 mobile related [internet domain] names over the last six months.\\" On October 10, 2014, Mobile Corporation named former U.S. Presidential Candidate and Democratic National Committee Chairman Governor Howard Dean as its Global Advocate. Dean, the previous Governor of Vermont, also joined the Advisory Board. By 2015, Mobile had developed a fully operational Mobile freelancing platform. In 2016, Mobile Corporation entered in to a definitive agreement to go public on the Toronto Stock Exchange through a merger transaction. The going-public transaction was not completed, with Mobile remaining a private company. In 2018, Peterson attributed the unsuccessful public transaction to \\"a combination of market conditions, regulatory issues and problems with former Board members.\\" As of mid-2018, Peterson remained the chairman and CEO of Mobile Corporation. =Management controversies and litigation= latina singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, and Edward Zuckerberg in 2014 In July 1999, shortly after the Quepasa public offering, Peterson was ousted from the company by Gary Trujillo, the new CEO that Peterson hired to run Quepasa sixty days prior to the incident.

The format of the show invariably followed the exploits of protagonist Emilia Golightly, who used events in her daily life as parables to preach virtues such as tolerance and charity. The events which Golightly relayed were usually relating to sex, alcohol or other vices and the segment drew much of its humour from the contrast between the saccharine message being broadcast and the circumstances under which Golightly discovered this message. Each slot followed the same format: *Golightly would talk about some event that had happened during her daily routine which would inevitably result in a thought suddenly striking her. This thought usually struck her when she was writhing around naked in some public place. *She would then draw a comparison between this event and life in the shows catch phrase (\\"Liiiiiiiiiiiiiife\\" pronounced repeatedly). *The bulk of the segment would then consist of Emilia discussing how the event made her think about her life and how she was ultimately better for this event. *The segment would end with Emilia asking her audience to improve their lives by following her advice, followed by a drawn-out 'Goodbye'. The segment was best known for Golightly's extremely long and drawn out way of saying the word \\"life\\", which she did in every episode, drawing comparisons between various topics (such as having sex with your neighbour or getting a new computer) and life. It was also infamous for her comments on topical characters on RT√â programming, particularly Cynthia Ni Murchu, Claire McKeown and Twink. There were many running gags and recurring motifs. One such running gag was that Golightly had abducted Irish singer/songwriter Enya and was holding her captive around the house. Enya would often be chained to a radiator, locked in the cupboard under the stairs or in some other unfortunate predicament. As the series of shorts developed Emilia Golightly's catchphrases grew more bizarre and eventually ended up having more emphasis than the main story. Initially the words 'Life' and 'Goodbye' were pronounced normally but they became elongated and experimental as time progressed. Emilia's reflections also became more abstract, disjointed and darker as time went on. It has never been publicly revealed who voiced Emilia Golightly, however according to her agency r√©sum√©, Fiona Looney was responsible for the over 2000 nightly reflections as the character.http://www.lisarichards.ie/playwrights/fiona-looney- playwright#.WwcOl0iFNPY References Category:RT√â 2fm presenters ","title":"Emilia Golightly"},{"id":"4879156","text":"The 1st Baron Rokeby, Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh. Baron Rokeby, of Armagh in the County of Armagh, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1777 for The Most Rev. Dr Richard Robinson, Church of Ireland Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh, with remainder to his brothers and his father's second cousin Matthew Robinson and the heirs male of their bodies. In 1785 he also succeeded his elder brother as 3rd Baronet according to a special remainder (see below). Lord Rokeby never married and was succeeded in the barony and baronetcy according to the special remainders in the letters patent by his third cousin Matthew Robinson-Morris, the second Baron and fourth Baronet. He was the son of Matthew Robinson (by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Drake and his wife Sarah, daughter of Thomas Morris, of Mount Morris), son of Thomas Robinson, son of Sir Leonard Robinson, brother of William Robinson, great- grandfather of the first Robinson Baronet (see below) and the first Baron Rokeby. The second Baron was an academic, politician and eccentric. Born Matthew Robinson, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Morris in 1746 on succeeding to the Mount Morris Estate in Monks Horton, Kent through his mother. He never married and was succeeded by his nephew Morris Robinson, the third Baron. He was the elder son of Morris Robinson. The third Baron sat as Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge. He never married and on his death the titles passed to his younger brother Matthew Montagu, the fourth Baron. Born Matthew Robinson, he assumed the surname of Montagu in lieu of his patronymic in 1776 on succeeding to the estates of his uncle Edward Montagu. The 4th Lord Rokeby represented several constituencies in Parliament. His younger son, Henry, the sixth Baron (who succeeded his elder brother), was a general in the British Army. The 6th Lord Rokeby had no surviving male issue and on his death in 1883 the barony and baronetcy became extinct. The 2nd Baron Rokeby. Francis Grant, PRA, published by Henry Graves & Co, 1858. The Baronetcy, of Rokeby Park in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 2 March 1730 for the architect, collector and politician Thomas Robinson, with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to his brothers and to his father‚Äôs second cousin Matthew Robinson, and the heirs male of their bodies. He was a descendant of William Robinson who acquired the Rokeby estate in the North Riding of Yorkshire from Sir Thomas Rokeby in 1610. He died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his younger brother, the second Baronet. He was also childless and succeeded by his younger brother, the aforementioned first Baron Rokeby. See above for further history of the baronetcy.

The effect of asymmetric induction is to lower the transition state energy for the formation of one enantiomer over the other In stereochemistry, asymmetric induction (also enantioinduction) describes the preferential formation in a chemical reaction of one enantiomer or diastereoisomer over the other as a result of the influence of a chiral feature present in the substrate, reagent, catalyst or environment.IUPAC Gold Book definition Link Asymmetric induction is a key element in asymmetric synthesis. Asymmetric induction was introduced by Hermann Emil Fischer based on his work on carbohydrates.Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products, Ari Koskinen Several types of induction exist. Internal asymmetric induction makes use of a chiral center bound to the reactive center through a covalent bond and remains so during the reaction. The starting material is often derived from chiral pool synthesis. In relayed asymmetric induction the chiral information is introduced in a separate step and removed again in a separate chemical reaction. Special synthons are called chiral auxiliaries. In external asymmetric induction chiral information is introduced in the transition state through a catalyst of chiral ligand. This method of asymmetric synthesis is economically most desirable. Carbonyl 1,2 asymmetric induction Several models exist to describe chiral induction at carbonyl carbons during nucleophilic additions. These models are based on a combination of steric and electronic considerations and are often in conflict with each other. Models have been devised by Cram (1952), Cornforth (1959), Felkin (1969) and others. =Cram's rule= The Cram's rule of asymmetric induction developed by Donald J. Cram in 1952Studies in Stereochemistry. X. The Rule of \\"Steric Control of Asymmetric Induction\\" in the Syntheses of Acyclic Systems Donald J. Cram, Fathy Ahmed Abd Elhafez J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1952; 74(23); 5828‚Äì5835. Abstract is an early concept relating to the prediction of stereochemistry in certain acyclic systems. In full the rule is: In certain non-catalytic reactions that diastereomer will predominate, which could be formed by the approach of the entering group from the least hindered side when the rotational conformation of the C-C bond is such that the double bond is flanked by the two least bulky groups attached to the adjacent asymmetric center. The rule indicates that the presence of an asymmetric center in a molecule induces the formation of an asymmetric center adjacent to it based on steric hindrance. In his 1952 publication Cram presented a large number of reactions described in the literature for which the conformation of the reaction products could be explained based on this rule and he also described an elaborate experiment (scheme 1) making his case. :Scheme 1. Cram's rule of asymmetric induction The experiments involved two reactions. In experiment one 2-phenylpropionaldehyde (1, racemic but (R)-enantiomer shown) was reacted with the Grignard reagent of bromobenzene to 1,2-diphenyl-1-propanol (2) as a mixture of diastereomers, predominantly the threo isomer (see for explanation the Fischer projection). The preference for the formation of the threo isomer can be explained by the rule stated above by having the active nucleophile in this reaction attacking the carbonyl group from the least hindered side (see Newman projection A) when the carbonyl is positioned in a staggered formation with the methyl group and the hydrogen atom, which are the two smallest substituents creating a minimum of steric hindrance, in a gauche orientation and phenyl as the most bulky group in the anti conformation. The second reaction is the organic reduction of 1,2-diphenyl-1-propanone 2 with lithium aluminium hydride, which results in the same reaction product as above but now with preference for the erythro isomer (2a). Now a hydride anion (H‚àí) is the nucleophile attacking from the least hindered side (imagine hydrogen entering from the paper plane). In the original 1952 publication, additional evidence was obtained for the structural assignment of the reaction products by applying them to a Chugaev elimination, wherein the threo isomer reacts to the cis isomer of -Œ±-methyl-stilbene and the erythro isomer to the trans version. :Scheme 2. Cram Asymmetric Induction Chugaev Reaction =Felkin model= The Felkin model (1968) named after Hugh Felkin also predicts the stereochemistry of nucleophilic addition reactions to carbonyl groups.Torsional strain involving partial bonds. The stereochemistry of the lithium aluminium hydride reduction of some simple open-chain ketones Marc Ch√©rest, Hugh Felkin and Nicole Prudent Tetrahedron Letters Volume 9, Issue 18, 1968, Pages 2199-2204 Felkin argued that the Cram model suffered a major drawback: an eclipsed conformation in the transition state between the carbonyl substituent (the hydrogen atom in aldehydes) and the largest Œ±-carbonyl substituent. He demonstrated that by increasing the steric bulk of the carbonyl substituent from methyl to ethyl to isopropyl to isobutyl, the stereoselectivity also increased, which is not predicted by Cram's rule: :Scheme 3. Felkin model for chiral induction The Felkin rules are: * The transition states are reactant-like. * Torsional strain (Pitzer strain) involving partial bonds (in transition states) represents a substantial fraction of the strain between fully formed bonds, even when the degree of bonding is quite low. The conformation in the TS is staggered and not eclipsed with the substituent R skew with respect to two adjacent groups one of them the smallest in TS A. :Scheme 4. Felkin transition state A and Cram transition state B : For comparison TS B is the Cram transition state. * The main steric interactions involve those around R and the nucleophile but not the carbonyl oxygen atom. * Attack of the nucleophile occurs according to the Dunitz angle (107 degrees), eclipsing the hydrogen, rather than perpendicular to the carbonyl. * A polar effect or electronic effect stabilizes a transition state with maximum separation between the nucleophile and an electron-withdrawing group. For instance haloketones do not obey Cram's rule, and, in the example above, replacing the electron-withdrawing phenyl group by a cyclohexyl group reduces stereoselectivity considerably. =Felkin‚ÄìAnh model= The Felkin‚ÄìAnh modelIt bears mentioning that in Vietnamese, the surname is given first, and so this would be better called the Felkin‚ÄìNguyen Model. is an extension of the Felkin model that incorporates improvements suggested by Nguy·ªÖn Tr·ªçng Anh and Odile Eisenstein to correct for two key weaknesses in Felkin's model. The first weakness addressed was the statement by Felkin of a strong polar effect in nucleophilic addition transition states, which leads to the complete inversion of stereochemistry by SN2 reactions, without offering justifications as to why this phenomenon was observed. Anh's solution was to offer the antiperiplanar effect as a consequence of asymmetric induction being controlled by both substituent and orbital effects.Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Nouv. J. Chim. 1977, 1, 61.Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O.; Lefour, J-M.; Dau, M-E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973, 95, 6146. In this effect, the best nucleophile acceptor œÉ* orbital is aligned parallel to both the œÄ and œÄ* orbitals of the carbonyl, which provide stabilization of the incoming anion. Image:Felkinanhfigure1.png The second weakness in the Felkin Model was the assumption of substituent minimization around the carbonyl R, which cannot be applied to aldehydes. Image:Felkinanhfigure2.png Incorporation of B√ºrgi‚ÄìDunitz angleB√ºrgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Shefter, E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973, 95, 5065.B√ºrgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Lehn, J. M.; Wipff, G. Tetrahedron 1974, 30, 1563. ideas allowed Anh to postulate a non-perpendicular attack by the nucleophile on the carbonyl center, anywhere from 95¬∞ to 105¬∞ relative to the oxygen-carbon double bond, favoring approach closer to the smaller substituent and thereby solve the problem of predictability for aldehydes.Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Tetrahedron Lett. 1976, 155.Anh, N. T. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980, 88, 146. Image:Felkinanhfigure3.png = Anti‚ÄìFelkin selectivity = Though the Cram and Felkin‚ÄìAnh models differ in the conformers considered and other assumptions, they both attempt to explain the same basic phenomenon: the preferential addition of a nucleophile to the most sterically favored face of a carbonyl moiety. However, many examples exist of reactions that display stereoselectivity opposite of what is predicted by the basic tenets of the Cram and Felkin‚ÄìAnh models. Although both of the models include attempts to explain these reversals, the products obtained are still referred to as \\"anti- Felkin\\" products. One of the most common examples of altered asymmetric induction selectivity requires an Œ±-carbon substituted with a component with Lewis base character (i.e. O, N, S, P substituents). In this situation, if a Lewis acid such as Al-iPr2 or Zn2+ is introduced, a bidentate chelation effect can be observed. This locks the carbonyl and the Lewis base substituent in an eclipsed conformation, and the nucleophile will then attack from the side with the smallest free Œ±-carbon substituent.Mengel A., Reiser O.Chem. Rev., 1999, 99 (5), 1191‚Äì1224. If the chelating R group is identified as the largest, this will result in an \\"anti-Felkin\\" product. Image:Felkinanhfigure4.png This stereoselective control was recognized and discussed in the first paper establishing the Cram model, causing Cram to assert that his model requires non-chelating conditions.Cram DJ, Elhafez FA. J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1952; 74(23); 5828‚Äì5835. An example of chelation control of a reaction can be seen here, from a 1987 paper that was the first to directly observe such a \\"Cram-chelate\\" intermediate,Reetz MT, Hullmann M, Seitz T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1987. 26, 477‚Äì480. vindicating the model: Image:Felkinanhfigure5.png Here, the methyl titanium chloride forms a Cram-chelate. The methyl group then dissociates from titanium and attacks the carbonyl, leading to the anti-Felkin diastereomer. A non-chelating electron-withdrawing substituent effect can also result in anti-Felkin selectivity. If a substituent on the Œ±-carbon is sufficiently electron withdrawing, the nucleophile will add anti- relative to the electron withdrawing group, even if the substituent is not the largest of the 3 bonded to the Œ±-carbon. Each model offers a slightly different explanation for this phenomenon. A polar effect was postulated by the Cornforth modelCornforth JW, Cornforth MRH, Mathew KK. J. Chem.Soc. 1959, 112‚Äì127. and the original Felkin model,Cherest M, Felkin H, Prudent N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1968, 18, 2199‚Äì2204. which placed the EWG substituent and incoming nucleophile anti- to each other in order to most effectively cancel the dipole moment of the transition structure. Image:Felkinanhfigure6.png This Newman projection illustrates the Cornforth and Felkin transition state that places the EWG anti- to the incoming nucleophile, regardless of its steric bulk relative to RS and RL. The improved Felkin‚ÄìAnh model, as discussed above, makes a more sophisticated assessment of the polar effect by considering molecular orbital interactions in the stabilization of the preferred transition state. A typical reaction illustrating the potential anti-Felkin selectivity of this effect, along with its proposed transition structure, is pictured below: Image:Felkinanhfigure7.png Carbonyl 1,3 asymmetric induction It has been observed that the stereoelectronic environment at the Œ≤-carbon of can also direct asymmetric induction. A number of predictive models have evolved over the years to define the stereoselectivity of such reactions. =Chelation model= According to Reetz, the Cram-chelate model for 1,2-inductions can be extended to predict the chelated complex of a Œ≤-alkoxy aldehyde and metal. The nucleophile is seen to attack from the less sterically hindered side and anti- to the substituent RŒ≤, leading to the anti- adduct as the major product.Reetz, M.T.; Jung, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1983, 105, 4833. Image:Felkinanhfigure8.jpg To make such chelates, the metal center must have at least two free coordination sites and the protecting ligands should form a bidentate complex with the Lewis acid. =Non-chelation model= =Cram‚ÄìReetz model= Cram and Reetz demonstrated that 1,3-stereocontrol is possible if the reaction proceeds through an acyclic transition state. The reaction of Œ≤-alkoxy aldehyde with allyltrimethylsilane showed good selectivity for the anti-1,3-diol, which was explained by the Cram polar model. The polar benzyloxy group is oriented anti to the carbonyl to minimize dipole interactions and the nucleophile attacks anti- to the bulkier (RM) of the remaining two substituents.Leitereg, T.J.; Cram, D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968, 90, 4011.Reetz. M.T.; Kesseler, K.; Jung, A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1984, 25, 729. Image:Felkinanhfigure9.jpg =Evans model= More recently, Evans presented a different model for nonchelate 1,3-inductions. In the proposed transition state, the Œ≤-stereocenter is oriented anti- to the incoming nucleophile, as seen in the Felkin‚ÄìAnh model. The polar X group at the Œ≤-stereocenter is placed anti- to the carbonyl to reduce dipole interactions, and RŒ≤ is placed anti- to the aldehyde group to minimize the steric hindrance. Consequently, the 1,3-anti-diol would be predicted as the major product.Evans, D.A.; Duffy, J.L.; Dart, M.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35, 8537. Image:Felkinanhfigure10.jpg Carbonyl 1,2 and 1,3 asymmetric induction If the substrate has both an Œ±- and Œ≤-stereocenter, the Felkin‚ÄìAnh rule (1,2-induction) and the Evans model (1,3-induction) should considered at the same time. If these two stereocenters have an anti- relationship, both models predict the same diastereomer (the stereoreinforcing case). Image:felkinanhfigure11.jpg However, in the case of the syn-substrate, the Felkin‚ÄìAnh and the Evans model predict different products (non- stereoreinforcing case). It has been found that the size of the incoming nucleophile determines the type of control exerted over the stereochemistry. In the case of a large nucleophile, the interaction of the Œ±-stereocenter with the incoming nucleophile becomes dominant; therefore, the Felkin product is major one. Smaller nucleophiles, on the other hand, result in 1,3 control determining the asymmetry.Evans, D.A.; Dart, M.J.; Duffy, J.L.; Yang, M.G. J .Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 4322. Image:felkinanhfigure12.jpg Acyclic alkenes asymmetric induction Chiral acyclic alkenes also show diastereoselectivity upon reactions such as epoxidation and enolate alkylation. The substituents around the alkene can favour the approach of the electrophile from one or the other face of the molecule. This is the basis of the Houk's model, based on theoretical work by Kendall Houk, which predicts that the selectivity is stronger for cis than for trans double bonds. :Diastereoselective epoxidation of a cis alkene In the example shown, the cis alkene assumes the shown conformation to minimize steric clash between RS and the methyl group. The approach of the electrophile preferentially occurs from the same side of the medium group (RM) rather than the large group (RL), mainly producing the shown diastereoisomer. Since for a trans alkene the steric hindrance between RS and the H group is not as large as for the cis case, the selectivity is much lower. Felkin‚ÄìAhn model for nucleophilic addition to chiral aldehydes Substrate control. addition of achiral allylmetals to Œ±-chiral aldehydes. An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to Œ±-chiral aldehyde. Substrate control: asymmetric induction by molecular framework in acyclic systems Asymmetric induction by the molecular framework of an acyclic substrate is the idea that asymmetric steric and electronic properties of a molecule may determine the chirality of subsequent chemical reactions on that molecule. This principal is used to design chemical syntheses where one stereocentre is in place and additional stereocentres are required. When considering how two functional groups or species react, the precise 3D configurations of the chemical entities involved will determine how they may approach one another. Any restrictions as to how these species may approach each other will determine the configuration of the product of the reaction. In the case of asymmetric induction, we are considering the effects of one asymmetric centre on a molecule on the reactivity of other functional groups on that molecule. The closer together these two sites are, the larger an influence is expected to be observed. A more holistic approach to evaluating these factors is by computational modelling,Houk, K. N. et al., Science, 1986, 231, 1108-1117. however, simple qualitative factors may also be used to explain the predominant trends seen for some synthetic steps. The ease and accuracy of this qualitative approach means it is more commonly applied in synthesis and substrate design. Examples of appropriate molecular frameworks are alpha chiral aldehydes and the use of chiral auxiliaries. =Asymmetric induction at alpha-chiral aldehydes= Possible reactivity at aldehydes include nucleophilic attack and addition of allylmetals. The stereoselectivity of nucleophilic attack at alpha-chiral aldehydes may be described by the Felkin‚ÄìAnh or polar Felkin Anh models and addition of achiral allylmetals may be described by Cram‚Äôs rule. =Felkin‚ÄìAnh and polar Felkin‚ÄìAnh model= Selectivity in nucleophilic additions to chiral aldehydes is often explained by the Felkin‚ÄìAnh modela) Anh, N. T. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980, 88, 145‚Äì162; (b) Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Nouv. J. Chim. 1977, 1, 61‚Äì70; (c) Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Tetrahedron Lett. 1976, 26, 155‚Äì158. (see figure). The nucleophile approaches the carbon of the carbonyl group at the Burgi-Dunitz angle.Burgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Lehn, J. M.; Wipff, G. Tetrahedron. 1974. 12, 1563‚Äì1572. At this trajectory, attack from the bottom face is disfavored due to steric bulk of the adjacent, large, functional group. The polar Felkin‚ÄìAnh model is applied in the scenario where X is an electronegative group. The polar Felkin‚ÄìAnh model postulates that the observed stereochemistry arises due to hyperconjugative stabilization arising from the anti-periplanar interaction between the C-X antibonding œÉ* orbital and the forming bond. Improving Felkin‚ÄìAnh selectivity for organometal additions to aldehydes can be achieved by using organo-aluminum nucleophiles instead of the corresponding Grignard or organolithium nucleophiles. Claude Spino and co-workersSpino, C.; Granger, M. C.; Boisvert, L.; Beaulieu, C. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 4183‚Äì4185. have demonstrated significant stereoselectivity improvements upon switching from vinylgrignard to vinylalane reagents with a number of chiral aldehydes. =Cram‚Äôs rule= Addition of achiral allylmetals to aldehydes forms a chiral alcohol, the stereochemical outcome of this reaction is determined by the chirality of the Œ±-carbon on the aldehyde substrate (Figure \\"Substrate control: addition of achiral allylmetals to Œ±-chiral aldehydes\\"). The allylmetal reagents used include boron, tin and titanium. Cram‚Äôs rule explains the stereoselectivity by considering the transition state depicted in figure 3. In the transition state the oxygen lone pair is able to interact with the boron centre whilst the allyl group is able to add to the carbon end of the carbonyl group. The steric demand of this transition state is minimized by the Œ±-carbon configuration holding the largest group away from (trans to) the congested carbonyl group and the allylmetal group approaching past the smallest group on the Œ±-carbon centre. In the example below (Figure \\"An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to Œ±-chiral aldehyde\\"), (R)-2-methylbutanal (1) reacts with the allylboron reagent (2) with two possible diastereomers of which the (R, R)-isomer is the major product. The Cram model of this reaction is shown with the carbonyl group placed trans to the ethyl group (the large group) and the allyl boron approaching past the hydrogen (the small group). The structure is shown in Newman projection. In this case the nucleophilic addition reaction happens at the face where the hydrogen (the small group) is, producing the (R, R)-isomer as the major product. =Chiral auxiliaries= Asymmetric stereoinduction can be achieved with the use of chiral auxiliaries. Chiral auxiliaries may be reversibly attached to the substrate, inducing a diastereoselective reaction prior to cleavage, overall producing an enantioselective process. Examples of chiral auxiliaries include, Evans‚Äô chiral oxazolidinone auxiliaries (for asymmetric aldol reactions)Evans, D. A.; Bartroli, J.; Shih, T. L., Am. Chem. Soc., 1981, 103, 2127-2129. pseudoephedrine amides and tert-butanesulfinamide imines.  Substrate control: asymmetric induction by molecular framework in cyclic systems  Cyclic molecules often exist in much more rigid conformations than their linear counterparts. Even very large macrocycles like erythromycin exist in defined geometries despite having many degrees of freedom. Because of these properties, it is often easier to achieve asymmetric induction with macrocyclic substrates rather than linear ones. Early experiments performed by W. Clark StillStill, W. C.; Galynker, I. Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 3981-3996. and colleagues showed that medium- and large-ring organic molecules can provide striking levels of stereo induction as substrates in reactions such as kinetic enolate alkylation, dimethylcuprate addition, and catalytic hydrogenation. Even a single methyl group is often sufficient to bias the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction. These studies, among others, helped challenge the widely-held scientific belief that large rings are too floppy to provide any kind of stereochemical control. A number of total syntheses have made use of macrocyclic stereocontrol to achieve desired reaction products. In the synthesis of (‚àí)-cladiella-6,11-dien-3-ol, a strained trisubstituted olefin was dihydroxylated diasetereoselectively with N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) and osmium tetroxide, in the presence of an unstrained olefin. En route to (¬±)-periplanone B, chemists achieved a facial selective epoxidation of an enone intermediate using tert-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of two other alkenes. Sodium borohydride reduction of a 10-membered ring enone intermediate en route to the sesquiterpene eucannabinolide proceeded as predicted by molecular modelling calculations that accounted for the lowest energy macrocycle conformation. Substrate- controlled synthetic schemes have many advantages, since they do not require the use of complex asymmetric reagents to achieve selective transformations. Reagent control: addition of chiral allylmetals to achiral aldehydes In organic synthesis, reagent control is an approach to selectively forming one stereoisomer out of many, the stereoselectivity is determined by the structure and chirality of the reagent used. When chiral allylmetals are used for nucleophilic addition reaction to achiral aldehydes, the chirality of the newly generated alcohol carbon is determined by the chirality of the allymetal reagents (Figure 1). The chirality of the allymetals usually comes from the asymmetric ligands used. The metals in the allylmetal reagents include boron, tin, titanium, silicon, etc. Fig. 1: Reagent control: addition of chiral allylmetals to achiral aldehydes Various chiral ligands have been developed to prepare chiral allylmetals for the reaction with aldehydes. H. C. Brown was the first to report the chiral allylboron reagents for asymmetric allylation reactions with aldehydes.Brown, H. C.; Jadhav, P. K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 2092. The chiral allylboron reagents were synthesized from the natural product (+)-a-pinene in two steps. The TADDOL ligands developed by Dieter Seebach has been used to prepare chiral allyltitanium compounds for asymmetric allylation with aldehydes.Duthaler, R. O.; Hafner, A. Chem. Rev. 1992, 92, 807. Jim Leighton has developed chiral allysilicon compounds in which the release of ring strain facilitated the stereoselective allylation reaction, 95% to 98% enatiomeric excess could be achieved for a range of achiral aldehydes.Kinnaird, J. W. A.; Ng, P. Y.; Kubota, K.; Wang, X.; Leighton, J. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 7920.

He was friends with many contemporary composers, and despite a considerable list of compositions is mostly remembered for having orchestrated the popular ballet score Ga√Æt√© Parisienne from piano scores of Offenbach operettas, and for his recordings as a conductor. Early life and career Rosenthal was born in Paris to Anna Devorsosky, of Russian-Jewish descent, and a French father he never met.Nichols R. Manuel Rosenthal: Obituary. The Guardian, 9 June 2003. His surname was taken from his stepfather, Bernard Rosenthal. He started his musical studies on violin at age 6, which he played in caf√©s and cinemas after his stepfather's death in 1918 to support his mother and sisters.Anderson, Martin, \\"A Century in Music: Manuel Rosenthal in Conversation\\" (April 2000). Tempo (New Ser.) (212): pp. 31-37. In 1920, he entered the Conservatoire in Paris but eventually left it after failing to win an expected first prize. In addition to continuing his violin studies with Alterman and Jules Boucherit and playing in theatre and cinema bands, he also studied composition. Around this time he met L√©o Sir, inventor of string instruments known as the dixtuor, and was persuaded to play the sursoprano (a 4th higher than the violin) and find composers to write for this new medium. Through this Rosenthal met eminent young Parisian composers of whom Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger were the most distinguished, and also contributed his own music to a recital in Paris in October 1921.Landormy P. La Musique Fran√ßaise apr√®s Debussy. Paris: Gallimard, 1943. His Sonatine for two violins and piano, composed for a sight-reading examination, was acclaimed after its performance at the 99th concert of the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante in Paris at the end of October 1924, attended by both Nadia Boulanger and Alexis Roland-Manuel. After a stint in the military he became Maurice Ravel's third and final student, seeing him once or twice a monthHis recollections were published as Ravel: Souvenirs de Manuel Rosenthal, edited by Marcel Marnat, Paris: Hazan, 1995. while also having lessons in counterpoint and fugue from Jean Hur√©. while continuing to play violin in the Moulin Rouge and Casino de Paris caf√© orchestras. Ravel's encouragement ultimately led to his winning the Prix Blumenthal (worth 20,000 francs) in 1928. Ravel lobbied the directors of the Op√©ra-Comique to get Rosenthal's one-act opera Rayon des soieries performed there in June 1930. He also arranged for Rosenthal's conducting debut, at a concert composed of Rosenthal's own music in 1928. Conducting career His conducting career began in earnest in 1934, when he became percussionist and assistant conductor of the Orchestre National de France, to D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht. In 1936, Georges Mandel invited him to conduct the Orchestre de Radio PTT. As his fame as a conductor grew, he was attacked in Action Fran√ßaise in 1937 by Lucien Rebatet, who demanded his expulsion from his radio conductorship. In the same year Serge Koussevitzky, in Paris during the Exposition, invited Rosenthal to become assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony under him ‚Äì an offer reiterated after a Salle Pleyel concert on the eve of war in 1939.Saudinos D. Manuel Rosenthal ‚Äì Une Vie. Paris: Mercure de France, 1992. After Ravel's death in 1937, and following the success of Ga√Æt√© Parisienne, he became a close colleague of great Russian √©migr√© composer Igor Stravinsky. Rosenthal's musical career was interrupted by World War II when, as a corporal in the 300th infantry regiment stationed in 1939 in Alsace near the Rhine, he was taken prisoner by the Germans in May 1940. Still musically active even as a POW, he not only organized concerts in the camp he was interred in but even composed an operetta based on a play by Georges Courteline. Included in a POW exchange, he was sent back to the occupied zone, arrived back in Paris in March 1941 and escaped to Marseille in the Zone libre (free zone) with the help of Roland-Manuel. But he was arrested in Besan√ßon in September 1941 while trying to see his son and sentenced to six months forced labor. With the assistance of a German officer, however, he got the necessary papers to escape back to Marseille. Later in 1942, he returned to Paris and courageously joined the Resistance, working with eminent musical colleagues D√©sormi√®re, Durey, Delvincourt, Charles Munch and others. Upon the liberation in 1944, he returned to the Orchestre National de France to become their principal conductor, a post he held until 1947. The first concert consisted of works from each of the Allied countries, including the Hymne √† la Justice by Magnard. He made sure a wide range of contemporary music was played, and the first season included a complete Stravinsky cycle. In his final year with the orchestra, he brought it to England to join Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic in a concert organized by Jack Hylton that filled the Harringay Arena with 13,500 listeners.The Independent, Obituary, 11 June 2003 In early 1946, Rosenthal's first conductorship in the USA was with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. Having accepted the post of composer-in-residence at the College of Puget Sound, he was invited to become music director of the Seattle Symphony, which he conducted from 1948‚Äì1951 while undertaking guest engagements in San Francisco and Buenos Aires. He then went to Algiers to conduct there and in Tunis during the winter of 1952-53. He was music director of the Orchestre Symphonique de Li√®ge from 1964-1967, and professor of conducting at the Paris Conservatoire from 1962 to 1974, where he established a more demanding schedule for his students, who included Yan Pascal Tortelier, Eliahu Inbal, Jacques Mercier, Marc Soustrot and Jean-Claude Casadesus. He conducted some of the first modern performances of Jean-Philippe Rameau's Zoroastre, at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux and the Op√©ra-Comique in 1964. The BBC in Manchester invited him to conduct an opera of his choice in 1973, which turned out to be Emmanuel Chabrier's Le roi malgr√© lui, for which he chose a French cast. In February 1981, Rosenthal made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera New York in a mixed-bill of 20th century French stage works, returning in 1983 for Francis Poulenc's 1957 operatic masterpiece Dialogues des carm√©lites and for further appearances in 1986-87.Metropolitan Opera archive - http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm He returned to Seattle in 1986 to conduct Richard Wagner's Ring cycle at the Seattle Opera.Girardot A. Manuel Rosenthal. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. (London & New York: Macmillan, 1997) He conducted the first performance of Claude Debussy's radical 1902 operatic masterpiece Pell√©as et M√©lisande in Russia, in Moscow in 1988, and later that year premiered the same work in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1992, he conducted a production of Padm√¢vat√Æ by Albert Roussel at the Opera Bastille. Composer Rosenthal composed prolifically in many classical genres, including operas, operettas, ballets, 13 works for orchestra, choral works both with orchestra and a cappella, works for solo voice and orchestra, chamber music, and music for voice and piano as well as for solo piano. The wide variety of his work, in terms of both genre and tone, reflects his refusal to accept the stylistic compartmentalization prevalent in Paris in the 1920s. His reputation as a composer was sealed in France with Jeanne d'Arc, first performed in 1936, although this was followed by a production of the light-hearted one-act operetta La Poule Noire of 1937. His best-known compositional work was not his own, the 1938 ballet Ga√Æt√© Parisienne orchestrated from operetta selections by Jacques Offenbach (copied manually by assistants who chose them from piano scores they speed-read in the Harvard University music library, the most complete repository of Offenbach scores known at that time). The commission by L√©onide Massine was originally entrusted to Roger D√©sormi√®re, but for lack of time D√©sormi√®re asked his friend Rosenthal to take over the project. Rosenthal was initially reluctant, but fulfilled the commission. Massine rejected the score but, after arbitration by Igor Stravinsky, finally accepted the work and choreographed the ballet, which turned out to be a major success. He also orchestrated works by Federico Mompou and Ravel. He was a fluent composer of choral and sacred works, such as La Piet√† d'Avignon (1943), Trois pi√®ces liturgiques (1944) and Missa Deo gratias (1953).

Philips GL5664 Personal life Rosenthal was married twice. His first marriage was to a chorus girl, Mlle. Troussier, in 1927. He had begun a relationship with soprano Claudine Verneuil while still married to his first wife, but during his tenure in Seattle presented Claudine as his wife even though he had not divorced Troussier. His failure to declare Verneuil's true status led to his detention for six weeks on Ellis Island on the way back to Seattle in October 1951, and his Seattle contract was terminated after the discovery of his first marriage. In 1952, he finally obtained a divorce and married Verneuil. He had two sons, Alain born in 1933 and Cl√©ment in 1956. He was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1961 and a Commandeur in 1991. A convert to Roman Catholicism, in 1999 he published a small book, 'Crescendo vers Dieu',Published by Descl√©e De Brouwer : Passerelles. in which he examined the religious beliefs that were woven into his life story. He died in Paris, just short of his 99th birthday.

In 1913, the family had branches in Belgium, France, Austria and Prussia. This dynastic house, which originally adopted its name from the Ch√¢teau de Crouy-Saint-Pierre in French Picardy, claimed descent from the Hungarian Prince Marc, (great-grandson of King G√©za II of Hungary) who allegedly settled in France in 1147, where he married an heiress to the barony of Cro√ø. The Cro√ø family rose to prominence under the Dukes of Burgundy. Later, they became actively involved in the complex politics of France, Spain, Austria, and the Low Countries. Among the more illustrious members of the House of Cro√ø were two bishop-dukes of Cambrai, two cardinals (one being also the Archbishop of Toledo and another being the Archbishop of Rouen), five bishops (those of Therouanne, Tournai, Cammin, Arras, and Ypres), one prime minister of Philip the Good, one finance minister, archchancellor, chief admiral, godfather and tutor of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (himself godfather to another Cro√ø), one Grand-Bouteiller, one Grand-Maitre and one Marshal of France; one Grand Equerry of the King of Spain, several imperial field marshals and twenty generals, four finance ministers of the Netherlands, two governors of the Netherlands and Belgium, one Russian field marshal; numerous ministers, ambassadors and senators in France, Austria, Belgium, and a record of thirty-two knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The head of the house bears the title of duke, with all the other members titled as princes or princesses. All of them bear the predicate of Serene Highness.  The Cro√øs of Burgundy  Castel of Chimay. Jean I de Cro√ø was responsible for the ascendancy of his family to a position of supreme power in medieval Burgundy. He served Philip the Bold and his son John the Fearless in the capacity of councillor and chamberlain. In 1384 he married a wealthy heiress, Marie de Craon, successfully suing her first husband's family upon her death. In 1397, Jean acquired the lordship of Chimay, which was to become a core dominion of the Cro√ø family. Four years later, he was appointed governor of Artois and led the ducal armies against the rebellious citizens of Liege. He was recorded as the Grand Bouteiller of the king of France in 1412 when he laid siege to Bourges. The following year, Isabeau of Bavaria had him apprehended and incarcerated in the castle of Montlh√©ry, whence he escaped. Jean, together with two of his sons, were killed in the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415. Antoine I le Grand, as represented on a miniature (ca. 1390) Antoine I le Grand, Jean I's eldest surviving son and heir, was a key figure in 15th-century French politics. Securing for himself the post of governor general of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, he presided over the pro- French party at the court of Philip the Good and was one of the judges at the trial for treason in 1458 of Duke of Alen√ßon. Like his father, he led French and Burgundian armies against Liege and distinguished himself at the Battle of Brouwershaven fighting against the English. While on a mission to the court of the Duke of Berry, he was implicated in the assassination of Louis de Valois, Duke of Orl√©ans and as a consequence suffered torture in the Ch√¢teau de Blois. Having extricated himself from this predicament, Antoine used his power to expand his family's possessions: in 1429 he obtained the lordship of Le R≈ìulx; three years later he married a princess of Lorraine, who brought Aarschot to his family as her dowry; in 1446 he purchased the Ch√¢teau de Montcornet and completely rebuilt it. In 1438 he acquired the castle of Porcien and was made Count of Porc√©an and Gu√Ænes by Charles VII in 1455. A year earlier, he had married his daughter to Count Palatine Louis I of Pfalz-Zweibr√ºcken in order to increase his influence in the orbit of the Holy Roman Empire. With Charles the Bold, the future Duke of Burgundy, he was at loggerheads, especially after they clashed over the inheritance of Jeanne d'Harcourt, Countess of Namur. Upon Charles's accession, Antoine was accused of plotting with astrologers to bring about the Duke's downfall and was compelled to flee to France. In France he took part in the coronation of Louis XI and was chosen as a godfather to the future Louis XII. It was not until the age of 83 that he reconciled himself with Charles and was allowed to reclaim his properties in Burgundy. He died either in 1475 or 1477 and was interred in Porcien. Agnes de Cro√ø was his sister and the mistress of Duke John the Fearless, by whom she had a natural son, the future bishop of Cambrai and archbishop of Trier. Several noble families of Belgium and the Netherlands descend from this prelate's eleven illegitimate children. The lines of Cro√ø-Arschot-Havr√© and Cro√ø-Roeulx stem from Antoine's two sons, Philippe I and Jean III, while his younger brother, Jean II, was the progenitor of the only extant line of the family, that of Cro√ø-Solre. All three lines engaged in a complex pattern of intermarriage, so that estates and titles would stay within the family as long as possible.  The line of Cro√ø-Aerschot  Portrait of Philippe I de Cro√ø, by Rogier van der Weyden Guillaume II de Cro√ø (1458‚Äì1521), Duke of Sora and Archi, godfather and tutor of the emperor Charles V, prime minister of Burgundy Antoine was succeeded as count of Porc√©an by his eldest son, Philippe I de Cro√ø, governor of Luxembourg and Ligny. Philippe I de Cro√ø was raised together with Charles the Bold, who arranged Philippe's marriage to Jacqueline of Luxembourg in 1455. The bride's father was extremely against the alliance and attempted to win his daughter back by force, but the Count of Porc√©an closed the borders of Luxembourg and announced that the marriage had been consummated. In 1471 Philippe defected to the king of France with 600 knights but returned to Burgundy to fight for Charles during the Battle of Nancy. During the battle he was taken prisoner. Following Charles's death, Philippe de Cro√ø helped arrange the betrothal of his heiress, Marie, with Emperor Maximilian I. Toward the end of his life, he was employed by the Emperor as governor of Valenciennes, lieutenant general of Liege, and captain general of Hainaut. Philippe commissioned a remarkable church in Ch√¢teau-Porcien, in which he was buried upon his death in 1511. Among Philippe's sons, Antoine, Bishop of Th√©rouanne, predeceased his father and lies buried in Cyprus. More notable was Guillaume de Cro√ø (1458‚Äì1521) (Guillermo de Chi√®vres, Chievres or Xebres in Spanish documents). As a tutor to Carlos I of Spain (afterwards Emperor Charles V), Guillaume became the power behind the Spanish throne during his pupil's minority, obtaining for himself the titles of Marquis of Aarschot and Duke of Soria and Archi. The Spanish aristocracy detested him as a foreigner, accusing him of pillaging the treasury and other irregularities, causing a wave of civil unrest to spread through Castile. Guillaume attended the Diet of Worms, where he was poisoned on 28 May 1521, apparently by German nobles afraid of his influence on imperial politics. Guillaume's nephew and namesake, Guillaume III de Cro√ø (1497‚Äì1521), was tutored by the Spanish humanist Juan Lu√≠s Vives. As it appeared unlikely he would succeed to the lands of his grandfather, Philippe I, he was steered toward the church. Family interests ensured his rapid promotion: he was elected bishop of Cambrai at the age of eighteen, and made a cardinal a few months later. Within a year, Charles V bestowed upon his young friend the archbishopric of Toledo, making him the primate of Spain. This unprecedented move brought Spain to the brink of a civil war. Guillaume accompanied his uncle and Charles to Worms, where on 6 January he died at the age of 23, following a fall from his horse. His tomb is in the Celestine monastery of Louvain, founded by his father. Guillaume III's elder brother, Philippe II de Cro√ø (1496‚Äì1549), succeeded to the County of Porc√©an upon his father's death in 1514. Like his predecessors, he was Governor of Hainault and senior knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, but it is as Charles V's general that he is best remembered. In 1533 Charles V created Philippe Duke of Soria and Archi and grandee of Spain. Earlier, he had become marquis of Renty and exchanged the lordship of Longwy in Normandy for that of Havr√©, which his descendants would develop as the family seat. His first wife was a cousin, Anne de Cro√ø, Princess of Chimay. She died in 1539, and nine years later Philippe married Anna of Lorraine, leaving offspring by both marriages. Philippe III de Cro√ø, Duke of Arschot Philippe II's eldest son, Charles I de Cro√ø (1522‚Äì51), inherited the principality of Chimay from his mother and succeeded to the duchy of Aarschot upon his father's death. He was assassinated in Quievrain two years later, leaving no children by his marriage to Louise of Lorraine-Guise. Thereupon Chimay and Aarschot passed to Philippe II's second son, Philippe III. Philipe de Cro√ø, Duke of Aerschot (1526‚Äì1595), was made 216th knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece by Philip II of Spain. In 1567 his cousin Antoine III de Cro√ø, 1st Prince of Porc√©an died without issue by his marriage to Catherine of Cleves, and the principality of Porc√©an devolved upon Philippe. His devotion to the Roman Catholic Church, which he expressed by showing his delight at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, led Philip II to regard him with great favor. He was appointed governor of the citadel of Antwerp but defected to the other side before long. Jealous of William the Silent's influence, he was then the head of the party which induced Archduke Matthias (afterwards emperor) to undertake the sovereignty of the Netherlands, and soon afterwards was appointed governor-general of Flanders by the state council. A strong party, including the burghers of Ghent, distrusted the new governor; Arschot, who was taken prisoner during a riot at Ghent, was only released on promising to resign office. He then sought to regain the favor of Philip of Spain, and having been pardoned by the king in 1580 again shared in the government of the Netherlands; but he refused to serve under the Count of Fuentes when he became governor-general in 1594, and retired to Venice, where he died in December 1595. Philippe III was succeeded by his only son, Charles II de Cro√ø (1560‚Äì1612), who was created Duke of Cro√ø by Henry IV of France in 1598. As Charles was childless, the duchy of Arschot passed to his sister Anne de Cro√ø, who had married Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg, thus bringing Aarschot to the House of Arenberg. Another sister, Marguerite, inherited the lordships of Halewyn and Comines, which passed to her husband, Wratislaw, Count of F√ºrstenberg.  The line of Cro√ø- Havr√©  = First line = Ch√¢teau d'Havr√© - a family seat of the line of Cro√ø-Havr√© Charles Philippe de Cro√ø (1549‚Äì1613) was the eldest son of Philippe II by his second wife, Anne of Lorraine. A successful imperial general, he was created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1594. It was the first time when a simple baron was admitted among Princes of the Empire. Charles Alexandre de Cro√ø, Marquis d'Havr√© (1581‚Äì1624) was the son of the preceding. He inherited the title of Prince of Cro√ø from his father, that of Count of Fontenoy from his mother, Diane de Dompmartin, and that of Duke of Cro√ø (in the French peerage) - from his childless cousin and brother-in-law, Charles II. He served as a hereditary marshal of the Holy Empire in the Battle of White Mountain, and advised Archduke Albert of Austria, Governor of Netherlands in the capacity of his chamberlain. Philip III of Spain made him the Superintendent of Finances and a Grandee of Spain. His second wife, Countess Genevieve d'Urfe, was a great beauty notorious for her many liaisons. When Charles Alexandre was shot dead in his palace at Brussels on November 5, 1624, French courtiers put the blame upon Genevieve and her reputed lover, the Marquis of Spinola. One innocent man was condemned on that account and was immured in a fortress until a true culprit admitted his guilt to a confessor 32 years later. Charles Alexandre's reminiscences were not published until 1845. Charles Alexandre's nephew, Ernst Bogislaw von Cro√ø (1620‚Äì1684), inherited both princely and ducal titles of Cro√ø when he was just four years old. As his father died a month after his birth, Ernst Bogislaw was brought up by his mother, Anne de Croy (also known as Anna of Pomerania in her native land, where he was styled Prince of Massow and of NeugartenEdward Rymar, Rodow√≥d ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt pomorskich, wyd. II, Szczecin 2005, s. 474, 475, 480.). Although he was destined for the church and received the see of Cammin in due time, Ernst Bogislaw also had illegitimate children by several mistresses. He died in K√∂nigsberg at the age of 63 and was buried in Stolp Castle. = Second line = Marie Claire de Cro√ø (1605‚Äì1664) was Charles Alexandre's only daughter by marriage to Princess Yolande de Ligne. She married two of her distant cousins, Charles Philippe de Cro√ø, Marquis of Renty (in 1627) and then his brother Philippe Francois de Cro√ø, Count of Solre (in 1643), in order to preclude the family estates from passing to another family. At the time of her first marriage, Philip III of Spain raised her marqusate of Havr√© to a dukedom, with her as the first duchess. By her first marriage, she had two children - Philippe Eugene de Cro√ø, Bishop of Valencia and Marie Ferdinande, Marquise of Renty, the wife of Louis Philippe, Count of Egmond. Her only son by the second marriage, Ferdinand de Cro√ø-Solre, succeeded to the ducal title. Among his children, Charles, 4th Duke of Havr√©, was killed at Saragossa in 1710; Marie Therese left children by her marriage to Landgrave Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt; and Jean-Baptiste de Cro√ø, the 5th Duke, left children by his marriage to Marie Anne Lante Montefeltro della Rovere (daughter of Antonio Lante Montefeltro della Rovere). This line came to an end in 1839, when the 7th Duke of Havr√© and Cro√ø died in Paris, aged ninety-five, having outlived all of his sons. His daughter and heiress married a distant cousin, Emmanuel de Cro√ø-Solre, who succeeded to the estates and titles. The 7th Duke's sister, Louise Elisabeth de Cro√ø-Havr√© (1749‚Äì1832), is best known for her book of memoirs on the French Revolution and the years of emigration that followed. A close friend of Queen Marie Antoinette, she was appointed by her to the vacant post of royal governess for the future Louis XVII. During the revolution, she was incarcerated with her own daughter and doomed to the guillotine when a mysterious gentleman smuggled them out of the prison. After one of her pupils ascended the throne as Charles X he made her an hereditary duchess. Louise Elisabeth de Cro√ø, 1st Duchess of Tourzel died in the Ch√¢teau de Groussay on 15 May 1832.  The line of Cro√ø-Roeulx  Ch√¢teau du Roeulx - a family seat of the line of Cro√ø-Roeulx The line of Counts of Roeulx descends from Jean III de Cro√ø (1436‚Äì1505), the second son of Antoine le Grand and younger brother of Philippe I. Jean III's grandson, Adrien de Cro√ø, 1st Count of Roeulx, served as governor of Flanders and Artois before his death in combat in 1553. His granddaughter is remembered as La Belle Franchine, the beautiful mistress of Alessandro Farnese. In 1609, the senior line of the Counts of Roeulx became extinct, and the county passed to a cadet branch, represented by Eustache de Cro√ø (1608‚Äì73), governor of Lille and Douai. Eustache's son, Ferdinand Gaston Lamoral de Cro√ø, unexpectedly succeeded to the duchy of Cro√ø in 1684, when the most senior member of the house, Ernst Bogislaw von Cro√ø, had died in K√∂nigsberg. After Ferdinand's grandson, 6th Duke of Cro√ø, died childless at Le Roeulx in 1767, the line of Cro√ø-Roeulx expired and the chateau du Roeulx together with the ducal title passed to the line of Cro√ø- Solre (see below). 19th-Century drawing of de Cro√ø's mummy at St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn. Probably the most illustrious member of the Cro√ø-Roeulx branch was Eustache's nephew, Charles Eug√®ne de Cro√ø (1651‚Äì1702). He participated in the Battle of Lund (1676) against the Swedes before succeeding to his father's title as Prince of Cro√ø-Millendonck in 1681. Charles Eugene fought with success in the Imperial Austrian Army against the Turks and participated in both the liberation of Vienna in 1683 and the attack on Belgrade in 1690. He was promoted Imperial field marshal for his vital services to the Austrian crown. In 1697 he entered the Russian service and was put in charge of Peter I's forces fighting in Livonia during the initial stages of the Great Northern War. After suffering a humiliating defeat in the Battle of Narva on 20 November 1700, Charles Eugene was taken prisoner by the Swedes and died at their fortress of Reval on 30 January 1702. On demand of his creditors, his body was not buried for more than a century (190 years- until 1897), and, when mummified, was exhibited in a glass coffin as a curiosity, with fees paid by tourists as a price of admission used to settle his debts.  The line of Cro√ø-Solre  =Origins= Arms of the line of Cro√ø-Solre Chimay Castle in Belgium Cro√ø Castle in the Netherlands The only line of the House of Cro√ø existing today, that of Cro√ø-Solre, descends from Antoine le Grand's younger brother, Jean II de Cro√ø (1395‚Äì1473), who governed Hainaut and Namur in the name of the Dukes of Burgundy. His dominions were centred on the town of Chimay, of which he became the first count. In 1430, he was made one of the first Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Jean II's grandson, Count Charles de Cro√ø-Chimay (1455‚Äì1527), made a name for himself in the Battle of Guinegate in 1479. He succeeded to the county of Chimay in 1482 and to the possessions of his mother, a countess of Mors-Saarwerden, several years later. In 1500, Charles was summoned to take part in the baptism of the future emperor Charles V, during whose minority he served as one of the governors. The Prince of Chimay had many children by his wife, Louise d'Albret, sister of Jean d'Albret, King of Navarre. Only two daughters reached the age of majority, Anne inheriting Chimay while Marguerite obtained Wavrin. The former married a cousin, Philippe II de Cro√ø, Duke of Arschot (see above), and their children succeeded to the principality of Chimay. Jacques III de Cro√ø-Sempy (1508‚Äì1587) was Jean II's great grandson and Charles de Chimay's nephew. It was through his mother, Louise of Luxembourg, that he succeeded to the Ch√¢teau of Fontaine-l'Eveque in 1529, later obtaining more lands as a dowry for his three marriages. His last wife, Yolande de Lannoy, brought the manors of Molembais, Solre, and Tourcoing to the House of Cro√ø. Their son Philippe was the first to style himself Count of Solre. He died in Bohemia in 1612, leaving two daughters and four sons, of whom the eldest succeeded as the 2nd Count of Solre. A younger son married the 1st Duchess of Havr√©, giving birth to the second line of Cro√ø-Havr√©, which expired in 1839 (see above). =Modern times= Towards the end of the 18th century, as other branches of the family were coming to an end, the line of Cro√ø-Solre accumulated a number of their titles and possessions. During the French Revolution, Anne Emmanuel de Cro√ø, 8th Duke of Cro√ø (1743‚Äì1803) moved his seat from Le Roeulx to the Westphalian town of D√ºlmen, formerly a possession of his wife, a princess of Salm-Kyrburg. Among his sons, Prince Gustave of Cro√ø (1773‚Äì1844) rose to become a cardinal and archbishop of Rouen. Another son, Auguste de Cro√ø, 9th Duke of Cro√ø, better known as Le Bel Auguste (1765‚Äì1822), was mediatized upon the demise of the Holy Roman Empire in his capacity as sovereign prince of D√ºlmen. When the Bourbons were restored to the throne of France, Auguste was made a peer of France. From three of Auguste's sons - Alfred, Ferdinand and Philipp Franz - descend the three extant branches of the House of Cro√ø, residing in Germany and France. D√ºlmen ponies extant today, owned by the Dukes of Cro√ø On 27 October 1913, Karl Rudolf, 13th Duke of Cro√ø, married Nancy Leishman, daughter of Pittsburgh industrialist John George Alexander Leishman, United States Ambassador to Germany and former president of Carnegie Steel. In 1974 Karl Rudolf died and was succeeded by his son Carl (d. 14 June 2011), 14th Duke of Cro√ø; Carl was married to Princess Gabriele, daughter of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria. Their eldest son, Rudolf, the 15th and current Duke of Cro√ø, married Alexandra, member of Miloradoviƒá noble family; they had six children. Duchess Alexandra died on 23 September 2015; her funeral took place at St Jakobus Kirche in D√ºlmen on 3 October 2015. The Duke and his family live at their Haus Merfeld estate near D√ºlmen.

The game's original Russian title is –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã–π –§—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç (translated: Eastern Front).  Background story  √úberSoldier follows the journey of the fictitious Karl Stolz, a German soldier who has, through the process of being killed in duty, then being resurrected, acquired supernatural powers which aid him in combat. Just before he was indoctrinated by the Nazis, a member of the German Resistance rescued him and effectively changed his loyalties. Karl Stolz now became the √úberSoldier of the German Resistance helping them destroy the \\"√úberSoldier fabrication\\" infrastructure.  Powers and Emotions  The power of the resurrection grants the player the ability to stop bullets. The shield retains the bullets until they hit something like a wall or an enemy. In the latter example, the bullet would kill or wound the enemy, making it a useful tool. Also, if the player deactivates the shield while bullets are caught in it, they will be shot back in reverse trajectory, which will kill any enemies that are hit by the flying bullets. The player is also able to increase the amount of damage you can take. Sequel A sequel was released in 2008 known as √úberSoldier II or Crimes of War, or under the original title, –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã–π –§—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç: –ö—Ä–∞—Ö –ê–Ω–Ω–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–±–µ (translated: Eastern Front: Fall of Ahnenerbe).  Reception  √úberSoldier was generally met with mediocre and negative reviews and has a Metacritic score of 57/100 based on 32 reviews. Bob Colayco of GameSpot gave the game a rating of 4.6/10, praising the graphics but criticizing the voice acting, high system requirements, and lack of multiplayer support. In 2014 the game found recognition in the YouTube community following the sequel's release on Steam.

In essence, it is an interpretation of how a company has succeeded. It describes the cultural norms and beliefs that the company espouses. Dominant logic can be useful when applied to corporate diversification. In this sense, dominant logic is a common way of thinking about strategy across different businesses. Negatively, it is logic which locks a company into thinking about making money in only one way. It is often used when talking about inefficient reasons for diversification of a company. This narrowed approach by a company can prevent a conducive environment for innovating and can stifle creativity. Dominant Logic is antipodal to the idea of using different methods and ways for generating profit. It is similar to the idea of kaizen which focuses on one process. In the field of strategic management, C. K. Prahalad and Richard A. Bettis described the concept of dominant logic in 1986. Prahalad and Bettis suggested that the way top managers deal with the increasing diversity of strategic decisions in a company, which are caused by acquisitions or structural changes in the core business, depends on the cognitive orientation of those top managers. Dominant logic consists of the mental maps developed through experience in the core business. See also *CK Prahalad *Richard A.

His submarine pitching form was noted during the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Amateur career Watanabe began baseball at age 6, and began throwing underhanded during middle school at the suggestion of his father. Watanabe attracted little attention through high school and college, and joined the Kazusa Magic amateur baseball team in 1999 after graduating from college. He was finally noticed by professional scouts when he was chosen as a member of the 2000 Sydney Olympics Japanese national team, where he marked a win in a game against Italy. He pitched in the Japanese national amateur baseball tournament in late 2000 and was drafted in the 4th round by the Chiba Lotte Marines that year. Professional career Watanabe made his debut in April 2001, starting a game against the Orix BlueWave. He won his first professional game with a complete game shutout, and ended the season with 2 wins. In 2002, he pitched in 6 games and had a record of 0‚Äì3. In 2003, he gave up 8 runs in his first start, and became a part of the starting rotation at the middle of the year, going 9‚Äì4 with a 3.66 ERA. He won 12 games the following year, won 15 games in 2005 with a 2.17 ERA. The Marines won their first championship in 31 years in 2005, and Watanabe pitched in the second game of the Japanese championship series against the Hanshin Tigers, giving up 4 hits in a shutout victory. He was chosen as a member of the World Baseball Classic team in 2006, but pitched poorly during the season, ending up with a 5‚Äì11 record, and a 4.35 ERA. He also led the league in hit batsmen (14). He holds the Japanese record for skipping stones, recorded on a show on Nippon Television. Chiba Lotte Marines manager Bobby Valentine made an appearance on the show as well. On November 6, 2004 David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox hit a 525 foot home run off Watanabe when the United States Major League Baseball team faced the Nippon Professional Baseball team in the second game of the traditional Japan All- Star Series. This blast by \\"Big Papi\\" has been recorded as the longest home run ever hit at the Tokyo Dome. He was released by Lotte on November 4, 2013. On December 13, Watanabe signed a minor league contract with Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox. He was released by the Red Sox on March 30 and on April 14 signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Pitching style Watanabe's famous pitching style during a game in 2010 Watanabe is known for having the world's lowest release point, letting go of the ball only about 2 inches above the ground, and his hand sometimes brushes against the ground as he throws. His body is much closer to the ground than other submarine pitchers, and his right knee has bled during games because it skids against the mound. He puts a pad on the inside of his uniform around the knee to prevent himself from bleeding. Watanabe's form is truly one of a kind, as there is no other pitcher in the world who throws from the same arm angle. Batters have trouble timing their swings against Watanabe, because his pitches seem to come in at completely different speeds compared to those of conventional pitchers. Watanabe relies on his distinct pitching form and timing to get batters out. In addition to changing speeds with his pitches, he sometimes changes the time he takes to windup and release the ball. He does not have precise control, but is consistent in the lower part of the strike zone. Watanabe is not known to strike out batters, (only 101 strikeouts in 187 innings in 2005) and relies on forcing batters to hit themselves into outs. His underhanded form requires less energy than a conventional pitching form, and he is able to pitch into later innings. Watanabe throws four main pitches; a fastball, sinker, gyroball, and a slider. Being a submarine pitcher, Watanabe's fastball is slow, sitting in mid to high-70s mph and topping out at low-80s mph, with movements. The sinker is probably his best pitch, as he fools batters by throwing it at the same speed as his fastball, or sometimes even faster. His slider is about 8-9 mph slower than his fastball, and breaks downward. Watanabe's gyroball is very slow, clocking around 60 mph, somewhat similar to the curveball of Washington Nationals pitcher Liv√°n Hern√°ndez (which actually is more like an eephus pitch). He often experiments with the gyroball, changing grips to make it resemble a change-up more than a gyroball. Watanabe's gyroball (though to be a slow non-breaking curveball) is held with a two-seam grip. Watanabe's control over the gyroball is below average, but he does get looking strikes and groundballs with it.

Retrieved 8 March 2012. The party was formally dissolved on 4 March 2012.  History  The People's Victory 21 () party (the later DLP) was formed in preparation for the presidential election of 1997. This was an attempt to unite South Korean progressives in a single party, but dissenting progressives who focused on class struggle argued that there was an excess of nationalism in the VoP21 platform. As an example, they pointed to the slogan of Kwon Young-ghil, VoP21's presidential candidate, \\"Stand up, Korea!\\" (). After the election, these dissenting progressives formed the \\"Youth Progressive Party\\" (). The Youth Progressive Party ran for election to the National Assembly in the Guro-gu local constituency, and attained 4.1% of the votes cast. In August 2001, the party changed its name to \\"Socialist Party\\" under the slogan \\"Against Capitalism, Against WPK\\", targeting certain nationalists known as the \\"NL\\" (National Liberation) faction within the Democratic Labor Party. The party changed its name to \\"Hope Socialist Party\\" () in April 2006, and to \\"Korea Socialist Party\\" () in October 2006 due to the Korean law forbidding the usage of a party name for four years when registration is canceled. In the 2008 parliamentary elections, the party amassed less than 3% of the vote, and the national election committee consequently canceled its registration. In November, the party re-registered with the name \\"Socialist Party\\".  Elections  On several occasions, the party ran candidates for President or Parliament, for example Kim Yeong-gyu in the 2002 presidential election, but it never won any elections. For the 2007 presidential election, Geum Min ran as the party's candidate for president. He proposed the idea of social republicanism, subsequently adopted as a component of the party's platform.

The Last Vampire (1994)https://www.amazon.com/dp/0340877456/ As the story begins, Alisa arrives at the office of a man named Michael who lied to her, invited her. He identifies himself as a private investigator. She tries to find out about a guy named Slim, but her best shot is Michael's computer. Alisa then enters high school as a student named Lara Adams and befriends Ray. She also befriends another young man named Seymour Dorsten. She uses Ray to get information from his father's computer. She lets herself be trapped by the unknown client's men. Unfortunately, it isn't easy to escape. After learning what she can, she kills Slim and some of his crew (the rest escape in a shootout with the police). A flashback narrates Alisa's life and explains who Yaksha is. In 3000 B.C. Sita was born in India. When she was seven years old, a disease struck her village, and most of the villagers died, including her closest friend who was pregnant with a child. A traveling priest from a different religion convinced the elders that he could drive away the disease by performing a ritual; it involved invoking a demon into the recently deceased corpse of Sita's friend. During the ceremony, the priest called forth a yakshini (demon) which killed the priest. Only a handful of the male villagers saw the demon kill the man and then supposedly vanish. But Sita, hiding in the bushes, understood that the demon had actually entered the corpse of the child, still inside his mother. Before vanishing, the demon seemed to stare straight at Sita though she is hidden behind a rock. When her father rushed to save the child from its mother's womb, Sita ran forth and stated that it is not the child that is moving, but the demon possessing the child's corpse. Her father decided to let her choose to let the child to live or die but she was afraid and confused. He said the only way to find out if it were evil or not was if they let it live. The father saved the child and Sita decided to name the child \\"Yaksha\\", meaning \\"begot from a Yakshini.\\" Yaksha grew to be a beautiful man in a short period of time, who'd always had an eye for Sita. By this time, she was grown up as well, and married to Rama, her husband, and even had a daughter named Lalita. It was about that time the men that had witnessed the long-ago ritual vanished, one after another, including Sita's father. One night, after her father disappeared, Sita was awoken by a strange noise, and upon leaving her home, was attacked and dragged away by Yaksha. He explained what he was, though the word for vampire did not exist then. Some of the men were with him, transformed as he was (though being the first, he was forever more powerful than any of them, including Sita). He convinced her to join him, threatening to kill her sleeping husband and child if she did not. It did not take long for the civilized world to realize what they were up against, and they begged Krishna, the 6th incarnation of the deity, to intervene. His men slaughtered most of the fleeing vampires, but Yaksha and Sita survived. Krishna and Yaksha fought, and in the end Sita was given Krishna's grace under the condition that she never create another vampire. Yaksha was pardoned as well, but the pact Krishna spoke to him was unheard by Sita. Yaksha spent nearly the next 5,000 years slowly hunting down the remaining vampires and destroying them before apparently being chased and murdered by a mob during the Middle Ages. Sita lived through the ages, in Egypt first, and gradually on and toward America, until the present day setting (1990s). Both Sita and Ray, on the run from Yaksha, figure out a way to survive the coming confrontation. Sita, sure that Yaksha is ready to die with her, sets up a trick. Bombs are put in the sitting room, with the button on Yaksha's chair (so he can kill himself, tired of his long life, and ensure that Sita goes with him). Unknown to him, Sita's and Ray's chairs sit on top of a thick steel plate beneath which are a separate set of bombs intended to send them flying high narrowly before the big explosion. Before she can set her plan in motion, Yaksha asks her what Krishna whispered in her ear thousands of years before and realizes the whole time that she was protected; Krishna had told Sita \\"Wherever there is love, there is my grace\\". Her love for Ray is what allowed her to break her vow and yet still keep Krishna's grace. When she originally became a vampire, she did so for love of her family, and therefore from the beginning she had always had Krishna's grace. Yaksha thus decides that she was not intended to be killed to fulfill Krishna's injunction to him, and lets them go while he waits his end. Sita manages to shove Ray afar before the explosion but she was close enough to be pierced by a stake right through her heart from behind. With Sita in Ray's hands contemplating Krishna's grace, the book ends in suspense as to whether or not she survives. The Last Vampire 2: Black Blood (1994)https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671872664/ Sita is now healed for the most part, but still suffering from continual pain. She is not healing as fast as usual, after being struck in the heart by a piece of flaming wood from the explosion that destroyed her home. She hears of a group of vampires in Los Angeles that have been brutally murdering people in the area. As she is the oldest vampire now that Yaksha is dead, it is up to her to figure out what is happening. She runs into the group, and quickly kills most of them only to find herself out-matched by the leader, Eddie Fender, whose vampiric abilities rival those of Yaksha himself. Surprised, she flees, and with Ray's help, deduces that Eddie must have found the remains of Yaksha from the explosion and used his blood to change himself. When she attempts a sneak attack to destroy Eddie and his group during the day at their hideout, Eddie instead springs a trap on her. Ray, her lover, then lights his \\"fuse\\" and kills himself in an attempt to kill Eddie and save Sita. The explosion forces Eddie to flee, and seriously injures Sita, who is rescued from the flames by Joel, an FBI agent whom she had met earlier in the book. Joel, unable to believe his eyes as Sita heals right there in the car, takes her to a motel, where she admits what she is, but leaves after admonishing him to never seek her out. She finds Yaksha, who had survived the explosion, stored in an ice-cream truck. Vampires hate the cold. Though they can still withstand Antarctic-like temperatures without protection, the cold slows down the healing process and hampers their mental functions. The explosion blew off Yaksha's lower torso as it turns out and Eddie had been keeping him in a weakened state in order to continue feeding off him. Comforting Yaksha as he dies, she does what he asks; she drinks the rest of his blood, increasing her abilities far beyond what they were, hopefully putting her on a par with Eddie. Eddie kidnaps Joel and in retaliation Sita kidnaps his mother, with whom he has a strange relationship, though her tactic fails. Eddie tricks her into releasing his mother, mortally wounds Joel, and then breaks his mother's neck. With Joel bleeding to death, Sita gives in to Eddie, who starts to drain her of her blood. As she eases in and out of consciousness and lucidity, she remembers a song Krishna once played on his flute, long ago in the duel against Yaksha. Krishna's flute could control people's emotions. Sita begins humming one of its frequencies, realizing that she could hypnotize Eddie and stimulate him to blind lust. She lures him into a freezer where she chops his head off with the emergency axe and rescues Joel, turning him into a vampire (against his wishes) and falling unconscious as the book ends. The Last Vampire 3: Red Dice (1995)https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671872680/ This third volume follows directly from the events recounted in The Last Vampire 2: Black Blood. Sita regains consciousness and finds herself surrounded by the police, S.W.A.T., and higher government groups. Realizing that she cannot allow Eddie Fender's blood to fall into the wrong hands, Sita comes to the conclusion that she must burn down the entire house. She retrieves a pair of gasoline drums from the back of the house where the freezer is located and douses the entire living room in the flammable fluid. She also notes how light the drums feel as she carries them. This is the first indication of her newly increased powers. The second one comes when she finds she is able to read the thoughts of the assembled police and S.W.A.T members outside, something she has never been able to do before. Joel, who is now a vampire, convinces Sita that he can negotiate their safe release since he is FBI. Upon setting foot outside Eddie's residence Joel is taken into custody despite showing his badge, which leaves Sita no choice but to surrender in order to protect Joel ‚Äì but not before she sets the house ablaze. The police are unable to put out the fire, and Eddie's body and blood are safely destroyed in the conflagration. In the armoured van she and Joel ride in, Sita breaks free and takes control of the vehicle leading to a high speed chase in Los Angeles. Upon seeing the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles, Sita realizes that there are helicopters parked upon their rooftops. Struck by the idea of an escape by flight she begins to drive towards those cut-glass monoliths. In transit, Sita shoots down helicopters and, on one occasion, jumps from one skyscraper window to another hundreds of feet away ‚Äì injuring herself slightly in the process, discovering that the strength of her healing factor is much greater than it was before. It is upon the roof of this second skyscraper that she comes upon the desired helicopter, the one by which she and Joel make their escape. The escape is not as smooth as Sita might have liked, however. While their helicopter is nothing more than a businessman‚Äôs runabout, they soon find themselves pursued by Apache helicopters. Certain that they cannot lose their pursuers in their company helicopter, they quickly decide to crash it into a lake. Flying towards the nearest substantial body of water, she and Joel make a jump into the water after Sita convinces Joel that faking their deaths is the only way to avoid capture. Sita escapes, but Joel, still uncomfortable with his newly discovered stamina and abilities, rises to the surface of the lake too soon and is captured by the military. Sita decides to follow and finds Joel taken into a heavily-gunned government base. Sita meets a man from the base named Andrew Kane, and she tries to seduce him to get him to get her to Joel. She is shocked to discover he has cracked the DNA of a vampire. After she tells the truth to Andy, he helps Sita to enter the military base. Her attempt is defeated and she is taken captive. To make matters worse, Andy confesses he is not Andy but her old lover, Arturo Evola, a brilliant priest and alchemist from the Inquisition who attempted to use Sita's blood to recreate the blood of Christ. This would, he believed, allow humanity to ascend beyond mortality; Arturo saw himself as doing God's work in offering immortality to Christendom. However, despite the high aims from which he drew his initial inspiration, he turned into a megalomaniac in the process. Going against Sita's wishes, he experimented upon their young friend Ralphe. The experiment failed, due to an alteration in Ralphe's emotional aura, and rather than the idealised hybrid of vampiric invulnerability and human purity, the boy was turned into a creature baser than either. While Ralphe possessed that same superhuman strength, he lacked all control. A vampire only feeds upon blood when needed ‚Äì and can control this craving, should such control prove necessary. Ralphe, however, was gripped by an insatiable hunger for flesh. The Inquisitors went after Ralphe but Sita killed him before they got to him. However, the Inquisitors found out that Arturo had made the savage demon Ralphe, and Sita believed he was burned at the stake. Arturo confessed he turned into a vampire-human hybrid and managed to stay alive. Sita uses her powers to incite a riot at the base and gets out of her cell, but not before reluctantly killing many of the soldiers there. Sita captures General Havor, the base commander of the base, and uses him to set off a nuclear warhead so as to destroy all the information regarding vampire DNA, as well as those samples of her and Joel's blood which are stored in the base. At this moment Arturo arrives with a legion of soldiers and prepares for a final battle. In the face of seemingly inescapable defeat, Sita ‚Äì becoming, after a fashion, her own deus ex machina ‚Äì discovers that the recent infusion of Yaksha's blood has imbued her with a new power: flight. Filled with the rays of the moon, Sita becomes transparent. When she tries to carry Joel with her she discovers that she cannot, indeed she cannot even touch him. The warhead explodes as she escapes, a loving Joel and contrite Arturo perishing in the blast. Sita then uses Arturo's alchemy equipment to turn herself into a human. At the end of the book, she figures out she is human and then hears someone knocking at the door. She does not answer it. Then Seymour comes to the door and is angry and upset with her for what she has done The Last Vampire 4: Phantom (1996)https://www.amazon.com/dp/0340619155/ Sita, having turned herself back into a human at the end of Red Dice, realizes she is indeed human. The man at the door from the end of the last book tries to make Sita open the door, but she is reluctant to do so. The man says he understands and will come back. After fleeing with Seymour from Arturo's home to a hotel, Sita is nearly raped by two drunks on the beach when she goes out for a late walk. She kills both men using her pistol and wanders into a nearby diner. It is there she finds herself face to face with none other than Ray, who claims that he didn't die in the explosion, but that Eddie had indeed revived him. He also reveals that he used Arturo's alchemical tools to make himself human again as well. After leaving Seymour behind, she and Ray moved to a suburb and she starts to go about normal, human life, befriending a very pregnant woman named Paula (who claims she has no idea how she was impregnated). Sita also discovers her own pregnancy as well and is stunned, but happy. It takes little time to find out that her child, Kalika, is indeed an incarnation of Kali Ma, the Supreme Goddess of Destruction and is far more powerful than even Yaksha. The child ages incredibly fast and begins craving blood, forcing Sita to abduct a young man named Eric Hawkins and keep him prisoner at her home to give Kalika the blood she craves. Eventually, Kalika becomes very interested in Paula's child. She eventually goes to great extremes to find the child, including brutally murdering Eric and taking Seymour as a hostage to ensure Sita delivers the baby to her. Sita advises her to flee and when she is far enough away to call a certain phone number in order to speak to Sita. To save Paula's child (who Sita believes is none other than the messiah, the new incarnation of both Krishna and Jesus), Sita acquires a portion of Yaksha's frozen and preserved blood from the ice cream truck in which Eddie kept him prisoner. The truck was being watched over by a strange homeless man with an odd grace; he believed she was going to come back for it one day. Sita returns to the Las Vegas residence of her former lover Arturo, the alchemist, and finds a startling resemblance between him and Kalika from a picture of his that she picks up. Sita discovers right then and there that Arturo fathered Kalika; because Arturo was a hybrid, he became the only being capable of making Sita pregnant while she was a vampire. She also finds that Ray had not returned to her, that he was a phantom and was no longer real. Sita \\"kills\\" Ray at his request and turns back into a vampire by once again using Arturo's alchemist equipment and combining Yaksha's blood with the blood of Paula's baby (Sita had stolen a vial of the baby's blood from the hospital). Because of the combination, she is even more powerful than before, being more or less equal to Yaksha, but is still no match for Kalika. Promising via the phone to deliver the baby to Kalika in exchange for Seymour on Santa Monica Pier. Sita, however, has been lying and does not bring Paula's child, telling Kalika that she has \\"come herself.\\" After a short and fruitless negotiation, a fight between the pair ensues. Kalika stops Sita effortlessly by breaking her leg and throws Seymour into the ocean. Shortly after this, she reveals that she is definitely the incantation of Kali, overwhelming her mother with her dark power. In her thrall, Sita unknowingly reveals the phone number which she asked Paula to call. In desperation, she asks Kalika who Paula's child really is. In response, her daughter tells her that the \\"knowledge will cost her\\". Sita repeats her question, and Kalika shows her the cost, fashioning a wooden stake which she throws at Seymour, piercing him through. As Sita jumps into the water and pulls the dying Seymour to shore, telling him that she will save him by making him a vampire, Kalika leaves. However, by the time that Sita and Seymour are on land again, it becomes clear that he is beyond even her help. Believing he is a vampire due to the lack of pain he is experiencing, Seymour asks if he will live forever, and when Sita tells him out of pity that he will, he tells her he will love her for that long. She replies, \\"Me too,\\" and he dies in her arms. Sita takes Seymour's body to a funeral pyre to cremate him. Struck by a sudden and astonishing possibility, Sita uses the remaining blood from the messiah child on Seymour and he comes back to life. Overcome with happiness, Sita does not tell Seymour of Kalika's actions but vows to stop her daughter from getting hold of Paula's baby. The Last Vampire 5: Evil Thirst (1996)https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671550519/ Sita's daughter, Kalika, has transformed into a blood-thirsty monster with power far beyond Sita's. It is Sita's task to track her down and destroy her, yet Sita still has trouble believing her daughter is totally evil. She still hopes to save Kalika, even if it means risking her own life ‚Äì and perhaps the lives of everyone in the world. The story opens as Sita and the newly revived Seymour attend a seminar of an ancient Egyptian Seer named Suzama. Sita knew her personally and is interested to know that, in her Seer's eye, Suzama predicted the birth of God in three mortal forms at exact times. Krishna and Jesus Christ were two of these incarnations. Sita learns from Dr. Donald Seter, the man who discovered Suzama's Scripture and the founder of the Suzama Society, that Christ has been born again as her friend Paula's new born son (and Paula herself is actually Suzama reincarnated). Unlike Ray, Paula begins to remember her previous life. Using her powerful powers of persuasion, Sita befriends Seter and his son James, authenticates the text, and discovers that Kalika wishes to kill the baby. She also learns that the Suzama Society was formed in order to protect the child. Mother and Daughter are reunited over the phone and through an apparent miscalculation on Kalika's part, Sita discovers where her daughter lives. Sita goes with Dr. Seter, James, and the Suzama Society to Kalika's home. There all the Society member are brutally murdered by Kalika, despite their preparations and automatic weaponry. In the end, Sita is pushed off the balcony of the building and is grievously injured. She recovers fairly quickly, however, and by using clues in Suzama's scripture, eventually deciphers the location of Paula and her child. Sita, James, Seymour, and Dr. Seter drive to that location to discover that Kalika has already arrived and taken the child. Armed with a shotgun, Sita pursues Kalika and corners her in a small house. James arrives shortly after. Too late, Sita realizes that he is really Ory, an old enemy from her past and an agent of the Setians, a malevolent race of reptilian aliens who are after Paula's child. Ory severely wounds both Sita and Kalika, and reveals that the Suzama Society‚Äîwith the exception of Dr. Seter‚Äîwe all his disciples. He then escapes with the child. Mortally wounded, Kalika gives her blood to her mother in order to save her. As she lies there dying, Sita realizes at last that Kalika never meant to hurt the child, but was only trying to protect him. She also reveals that she killed Eric (the young man from Phantom) as an act of mercy since he has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and would have suffered greatly had she not ended his life. For the first time in her life, Kalika explicitly tells her mother that she loves her, and then she dies. Later, Sita arrives at the spot where Paula's son was conceived and experiences a cosmic event while remembering her last meeting with Suzama, in which she is irradiated with stellar energy and transformed into an ethereal being. Moments later, the Setians, who also exist in the same state as Sita arrive in their spaceship to take the baby back to their homeworld, where they will consume his holy powers. Sita possesses the body of Croka, the Setian commander and is able to use him to attack and incapacitate Ory long enough to her to save the baby. After doing so, she slits his throat and the Setians, knowing they have lost their chance, quickly flee. The book ends with Sita returning the baby to Paula alive and safe. The Last Vampire 6: Creatures of Forever (1996)https://www.amazon.com/dp/0340619198/ After the events of Evil Thirst (in which Sita learns that there is more strangeness to the world than Vampires) Sita now knows that Paula is the incarnation of her oldest friend, Suzama the great Egyptian Seer; Paula tells Sita that something is going to happen. Distraught, Sita asks if she will ever see Paula again, and she says no. Leaving Seymour and Paula behind, Sita begins delving deeper into the secrets of the group of powerful beings that stalk her. Along the way she confronts another of these creatures, only to find that their time is near at hand, brought about by a centuries-old mistake committed by none other than the last vampire herself ‚Äì Sita. After dispatching this foe, Sita is approached by a young woman claiming to be a friend who offers Sita the chance to set right what went wrong nearly a thousand years earlier. Using a revamped version of time travelling which projects her mind into herself 1000 years earlier, Sita embarks on a journey into the heart of darkness and confronts the necromancer, Landulf of Capula, the architect of this evil plot who not only deceived and used Sita's power for evil before wiping her mind of the event but also now has the power to upset the balance of life itself, tipping the scales in the favor of evil. In this epic conclusion to the Last Vampire, Sita must confront her darkest fears and face an unthinkable choice: to go on as a creature of forever, or forsake her life and power for a destiny turned to ash five thousand years earlier. She, finally tired of her immortal existence like Yaksha before her, chooses to prevent vampires from ever coming into being by projecting her mind to when she was a child, and this time she kills Yaksha instead of sparing him; she lives out her life as a mortal, meaning that all of the previous books have in effect never happened. Still, one evening Sita leaves her home, husband and child, and waits in the night for something she cannot name or even know. When it does not come, she resumes her life. Had she not killed Yaksha in the womb, that was/would have been the time he abducted and changed her. Shortly after this, Krishna appears to Sita and her daughter Lalita and asks her if she is truly happy. Sita replies that she could not possibly be happier, and Krishna leaves her, never to see her again. The book ends as Seymour completes his work on his latest story. The reader finds that the saga of Sita, the Last Vampire, is a story written by Seymour, who is in fact dying of his HIV infection. The Last Vampire 7: The Eternal Dawn (2010) It is revealed that the events in all of the previous books had indeed still happened, but with a crucial difference: Seymour had connected to Alisa's mind during the time of her adventures and he had literally experienced everything that happened with her and used those memories as the basis for the books. It is also revealed that Seymour, due to the great medical advancements made for HIV/AIDS patients, had never died and although he is still HIV positive, is living as a relatively healthy young man. While in Seymour's books, Sita remained in the past and never became a vampire; in reality, she returned to the present day after defeating Landulf and went on with her life. She and Seymour would finally meet in person in Book 7. It is also shown in Book 7, Sita placed a small amount of blood in his system, destroying the HIV virus--the same way Seymour had written it in his books. Alisa discovers Teri, a long lost descendant of her human family, all she wants is to get closer to her. Knowing Teri ultimately leads to knowing Matt, Teri‚Äôs boyfriend. And as much as Alisa wants to ignore the connection she feels with Matt, she can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. That is, until she is attacked in her home by someone who is definitely not human‚Ä¶ Off in search of this new race of immortals before they get to her first, Alisa travels with Matt to Europe and discovers that there is more behind these immortals, and Matt, than she ever thought possible. The Last Vampire 8: The Shadow Of Death (2011) After the events of The Eternal Dawn, Sita is living in the body of her descendant, Teresa \\"Teri\\" Raine, after she was shot through the heart with an advanced laser-gun weapon. It is two weeks after her \\"death\\", and she attends her own funeral where she tells Seymour that she is not really Teri, but Sita. The IIC, a powerful company with an Array, a group of psychic children and teens, that allows them to overpower a targeted person's will and force them to commit acts they would not actually do, are the only ones who can help Sita destroy the Source, the leaders of the Telar. The Telar are a race of immortals from 10000 B.C., ancient Egypt. They are going to release a deadly virus to eliminate all humans on Earth, as the Telar have had a permanent vaccine that will make them immune. After a strange ritual with Umara, Yaksha's wife and the oldest Telar, Sita is returned into her rightful body, which had healed itself in the last week. Sita then strikes a deal with the president of the company, and uses the Array and Cradle to kill the leaders of the Telar, and uses the virus the Telar planned to release to kill the Cradle. Sita spares only the president of the company, Cynthia Brutran, and Brutran's daughter Jolie. During this epic final battle, Sita revisits what happened in between her death and awakening two days later in Teri's body, and finds that she made a deal with an ancient demon to escape from a sentence to Hell. Thinking they are free, Sita, Shanti, Seymour, Cynthia and Jolie, and Matt quickly escape from the company's head office, which then explodes, killing the Cradle and Array. They prepare to run away from the FBI, when Sita discovers that Shanti, the sweet and perfect Indian girl Sita rescued in The Eternal Dawn, is the traitor. She had always been the demon Tarana, who was really Lucifer, or The Light Bearer. The book ends with Sita decapitating Shanti and discovering that she was never sentenced to Hell, but in fact saw Krishna once again who gave her a choice to stay dead or return to life. The Last Vampire 9: The Sacred Veil (2013) In her five thousand years as a vampire, Alisa- or Sita, as she was originally called - has experienced the equivalent of fifty lifetimes. Every moment of her immortal life is seared deep into her being. Every person she has loved, every victim she has killed-their faces are forever a part of her. Yet, strangely, a handful of memories has been lost to Alisa. As she and her friends embark on a search for the location of a sacred artifact-an ancient veil that may hold the key to mankind's salvation-Alisa soon realizes that her own mind may be her greatest enemy. The memories she is blocking deal with the most horrifying period in mankind's history, a time when she was tortured by a madman responsible for the deaths of millions. But what information did her torture yield?

The town of St. George's is about north of the airport and is the capital of the island nation of Grenada. The airport is located on Point Salines, the most southwestern point of the island. It is named after former Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, who championed the construction project in 1979.  History  The building of the airport ‚Äî designed to replace the obsolete Pearls Airport on the north side of the island ‚Äî was cited by U.S. President Ronald Reagan as evidence that the Grenadian government intended to allow it to be used as a way point for Soviet military aircraft en route to Cuba. He buttressed this claim with the evidence that it was being built, in part, by Cuban workers. Bishop and his government contended that the Point Salines airport was intended to make the island more accessible to European and North American tourists. The long-range jets that carried such tourists could not land on the short and geographically difficult runway at the existing airport, Pearls. As a result, tourists bound for Grenada had to put up with the delays, expenses and perceived risks of changing to smaller planes flown by regional carriers. The Grenadian government said they hoped their tourist trade would dramatically increase if direct flights from Europe and North America were possible. The airport itself was designed by a Canadian firm and specialized construction contracts were awarded to European contractors. Two private American construction firms also participated in the project. The unfinished airport was chosen as the jump-off point for the invasion of Grenada by the United States in October 1983. The event that precipitated the U.S.-led invasion was not the construction of the airport, but, rather, a violent coup in which Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was killed. The American justification for the invasion was the perceived threat to American medical students at St. George's University, whose campus is a short distance from the airport. At dawn on Oct. 25, 1983, more than 500 Rangers from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the United States Army 75th Ranger Regiment conducted a risky, low-altitude parachute assault onto the unfinished airport. Despite resistance from Grenadian armed forces (PRA - People's Revolutionary Army) and armed Cuban construction workers, the Rangers secured all of their objectives on the airfield quickly. The seizure of the airfield allowed United States Air Force C-141 transport planes to land, beginning at 2:05 P.M., and unload six battalions of paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division, the follow-on occupation force. After the invasion, Point Salines International Airport was completed with $19 million in American assistance and landed its first commercial passenger plane on Oct. 28, 1984. The airport was renamed for the late Prime Minister in 2009.  Facilities  The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 10/28 with an asphalt surface measuring .

It is part of Oxford's Humanities Division. The Theology Faculty Centre was at 34 St Giles' in central Oxford. It is now on the second floor of the Gibson Building in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter on Woodstock Road.  History  One of the first series of lectures delivered at Oxford University was on theology. As early as 1193, Alexander Neckam from St Albans gave biblical and moral lectures on the Psalms of David and the Wisdom of Solomon. One of the first university buildings was the Divinity School, begun in 1423 specifically for theology lectures. The modern theological faculty emerges during the reform of the University of Oxford in the nineteenth century. The Final Honour School of Theology - as a route to the Bachelor of Arts degree - was introduced in 1869. Up until then, theological study was the reserve of graduates and those seeking ordination in the Church of England, who would attend a short series of lectures by the Regius Professors on basic divinity; its focus was on the Thirty-Nine Articles, Joseph Butler's Analogy of Religion and a knowledge of the Greek New Testament. Although an honour school in theology was recommended from as early as 1853, it was not until the late 1860s, amidst concerns about the declining influence of the Established Church in the university, that Edward Pusey and Henry Parry Liddon began to advocate the introduction of a separate School of Theology responsible for the training of Anglican ordinands. Its curriculum was biblical and historical in its focus, with its first examinations requiring knowledge of scripture, ecclesiastical history and patristics, dogmatic and symbolic theology, apologetics, liturgy and sacred criticism. The faculty remained as a stronghold of the Church of England well into the 20th century, with denominational restrictions on the higher theological degrees (the Bachelor of Divinity and the Doctor of Divinity) and examiners in the Final Honour School of Theology only being abolished in 1920 and 1922 respectively. Still, three of the regius professorships are tied to canonries at Christ Church Cathedral, requiring their holders to be in ordained in the Church of England or in a church in communion with the Church of England. A significant proportion of the faculty's students are preparing for ordination, either as candidates for the B.A. or the B.Th. Despite the faculty's historic obligations to the Church of England, the foundation of Nonconformist and Roman Catholic institutions in Oxford from the late 19th century onwards, alongside changing academic and ecclesiastical attitudes towards theological study, resulted in the gradual transformation of theology from a purely professional discipline into an aspect of humanistic study. During the 20th century, Oxford established itself as an internationally significant centre of theological study with important contributions from S. R. Driver, William Sanday, C. H. Turner, B. H. Streeter, N. P. Williams, R. H. Lightfoot, G. R. Driver, Austin Farrer, Maurice Wiles, Henry Chadwick, James Barr and Arthur Peacocke. Although the department has, more recently, introduced examination papers in modern systematic theology, world religions and even separate postgraduate master's degrees in the study of religion, the Final Honour School of Theology remains primarily focused on biblical and historical study. Each undergraduate devotes at least half of his or her degree to the study of the Old Testament, New Testament, the development of Christian doctrine to AD 451 and modern Christian doctrine. Candidates can then choose four further papers from a wide selection of topics in biblical studies, history, doctrine and world religions.

The most common skidpad use is testing lateral acceleration, measured in g. This usage is similar to that of a kick plate. The test is carried out on a circular track with a defined radius. A car driving on said track is slowly accelerated until the outermost tires on the car begin to slip. Going any faster would cause the car to drive outside the defined radius. At this point, the speed of the car is recorded, and given the centripetal acceleration formula, v¬≤/r, a car's handling in terms of lateral gs can be derived.

First implemented in the HSC50 hierarchical storage controller, the protocol quickly spread throughout the entire line of mass storage controllers built by DEC. The UDA50 is an implementation of MSCP built on a Unibus card; other implementations (for example, the RQDX) stretch down to the Q-bus and small, 5 megabyte disk drives and even diskettes. Designed to minimize the amount of CPU involvement, the protocol depends upon two queues. Into one queue are placed packets which fully describe the commands to be executed by the mass storage subsystem. To initiate an I/O request, the CPU has only to create a small data structure in memory, append it to a \\"send\\" queue, and if that is the first packet in the send queue, wake the MSCP controller. After the command has been executed, an appropriate status packet is placed into the second queue to be read by the CPU. Interrupts to the CPU (a costly operation) are not needed so long as further command packets remain in the command queue and the response queue is not in danger of over-flowing. I/O-space reads and writes to the MSCP controller, a less-expensive but still-costly operation, are similarly minimized. Because MSCP packets were deliberately designed to resemble the packets exchanged on the VMScluster interconnects, it is a very inexpensive operation to ship storage requests around a VMScluster for remote execution; this greatly facilitates the creation of large-scale VMSclusters. The dependence upon in-memory packets and the minimization of interrupts and I/O-space reads and writes greatly facilitates remote operations.

Readers be aware that there is an alternative spelling for the adjective derived from Friuli: friulan, as influenced by the Veneto dialect form 'furlan'. The printed example of this is the Friulan Dictionary: English-Friulan, Friulan-English. edited by Gianni Nazzi & Deborah Saidero and published by Ent Friul tal Mond, 2000. Even if the first poems in Friulian date from the 14th century (anonymous works written in Cividale such as Piru√ß my√≤ do√ß inculurit and Soneto furlan, close to the Italian poetic movement Dolce Stil Novo), the birth of a full flavoured Friulian literature dates back only to the 19th century, when Friuli, after the Congress of Vienna, fell entirely under the control of the Austrian empire. This late flourishing had several causes: first, the language of the culture and administration had never been Friulian, but Latin and partly German under the Patriarchal State of Aquileia and Italian, mixed with Venetian under the Serenissima rule. Moreover, Friuli never saw the formation of a literate bourgeoisie that could have fostered the language, in order to have a literary development similar to other European languages. During the 16th century for example, there were only limited poetic forms in Friulian inspired by the works of Francesco Petrarca, including the poems of Nicol√≤ Morlupino from Venzone (1528-1570) and Girolamo Biancone from Tolmezzo (1515-1580). Also, until 1800 there were no printed works in Friulian, so the diffusion of poetry and other works was restricted to a small number of persons.  17th century  During this period, the most important Friulian authors were Eusebi Stele (Eusebio Stella) of Spilimbergo (1602-1671), born to a noble family, who composed poems in a playful and ironic style about his life and love adventures; and the count Ermes di Color√™t (1622-1692), notable mainly for his use of the koin√® from Udine, that would become the most notable literary language and the basis of today's standard Friulian. Ermes was educated at Medici's court in Florence, then took part in the Thirty Years' War, worked in the service of the Venetian Republic and Leopold I of Habsburg; in the last part of his life he returned to his homeland to focus on writing poetry, most of which centers on the theme of love. Ermes di Colloredo: Poesie Friulane, l‚ÄôOpera Completa\\". LiteraryJoint Press, Philadelphia, PA, 2019. The complete work of Ermes Earl of Colloredo, full text.  18th century  This century was undoubtedly poor in the development of Friulian literature, probably due to the increasing influence of Venetian language in the city of Udine. Noteworthy, though, was the publication of the first Friulian almanac (strolic or lunari in Friulian) in 1742. The almanac contained short stories, poems and agricultural advice, with an item for each day of the year; these kinds of works would be very popular in the following centuries.  19th century  The first half of the century was similar to the previous one. The primary Friulian author of the 19th century, and today probably the best known in all of Friulian literature, was Pieri √áorut (Pietro Zorutti, 1792‚Äì1867). √áorut's poetry was plain, far removed from the popular romanticism of the period; he devoted himself mainly to the almanacs, called Strolic furlans, published yearly from 1821 until 1867. His most famous work is Plovisine, composed in 1833. √áorut enjoyed great popularity in Friuli during his life and many tried to imitate his style. Today he is respected mainly for his usage of Central Friulian, which he sought to elevate to a literary language. Another author of almanacs was Antoni Broili (1796‚Äì1876), who achieved better results from the literary point of view. In the second half of the century, the city of Gorizia was generally more vivacious than that of Udine; there was a different feeling of \\"Friulanity,\\" and the environment was mitteleuropean, since the city (part of the county of Gorizia and Gradisca) was under the rule of Austro-Hungarian empire, while Udine was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866. In Gorizia, many tried to use the Friulian language in different fields, such as the applied sciences, with good results; one example from the period is the almanac Il me pa√Æs. Strenna popol√¢r pal 1855 by Federico de Comelli of Gradisca (1826-1892). Carlo Favetti from Gorizia also published several books of poetry and plays in the local Friulian dialect. An important literary event, although very late in comparison to other European languages, was the publication of the first Friulian vocabulary, composed by abbot Jacopo Pirona and his nephew Giulio Andrea (1871), which is still a valuable language resource today. In 1873, Graziadio Isaia Ascoli published an analysis of Friulian. Ascoli started the so-called Questione Ladina. Also deserving of mention is Caterina Percoto, who has an important role in Italian literature of this century, but who left only a few works in Friulian, mainly regarding popular traditions.  20th century  At the beginning of 1900 Friuli seemed far from the numerous avant-gardes of the period, at least in part due to its difficult historical situation; the regional request for autonomy received no response from the Italian authorities, and in 1933 the fascist regime prohibited any publications in Friulian. The most important authors of this time were Vittorio Cadel of Fanna (1884-1917), who composed poems with a sensual background, concealing a deep feeling of sadness and discouragement; Ercole Carletti (1877-1946) of Udine, author of poems in a style close to Italian crepuscolarismo; and Celso Cescutti. A rare example of political and civil themes can be found in Giovanni Minut's Rimis furlanis (1921). Minut, born in Visco in 1895, was forced to flee to Uruguay when the fascists came to power; he died there in 1967. In the area of Gorizia, Delfo Zorzut of Cormons composed various collections of short stories (La furlane, Sturiutis furlanis) and gathered many popular legends and traditions, useful to keep alive an interest in the language. But the most important Friulian work of the 20th century was the Academiuta di lenga furlana, founded by Pier Paolo Pasolini. Pasolini collected a group of writers in order to go beyond the old poetry inspired by Pieri √áorut's works, which was still imitated, to create a new and modern Friulian poetry. Other noteworthy figures in the movement include Domenico Naldini (Pasolini's cousin) and Riccardo Castellani. Neither, however, reached the poetical heights of their leader. Their works were in the Concordiese dialect of Friulian, in polemic with the use of Central Friulian as the only literary standard. Other developments after World War II included the lyrical works of Franco de Gironcoli, from Gorizia. Gironcoli studied and analysed poems from Ermes di Color√™t and the Pirona vocabulary, and from 1944 on he composed several short lyrics, dedicated mainly to the flowing of time. Josef Marchet, a priest, began the difficult work of promoting and standardizing the language; he tried to arrange a Friulian grammatic in Lineamenti di grammatica friulana, with the purpose of developing a standard variant of the language. In 1950 he also published the collection Risultive, wherein were gathered the works of several interesting Friulian poets of the time (including Novella Cantarutti from Spilimbergo; Dino Virgili, composer of the novel L'aghe dapit la cleve; and Lelo Cjanton (Aurelio Cantoni)). 1971 saw the publication of a translation with the title Prime di sere of the novel Il vento nel vigneto, written in Italian by the Friulian writer Carlo Sgorlon, which enjoyed a good success.  21st century  While poets and song writers in Friuli continue to keep the language alive, Friulan has been used in Toronto, Canada, for many years by immigrants from Friuli. A notable example is the bilingual poem collection, From Friuli: Poems in Friulan, with English Translations, (2015) by Rina Del Nin Cralli and edited by Joseph Pivato. Rina is originally from Codroipo and said she was inspired to write poetry in Friulan by the books, Un Friul vivut in Canada (1977) by Ermanno Bulfon and A Furlan Harvest: An Anthology (1993) edited by Dore Michelut, an Italian- Canadian poet.

Brooklyn, New York, January 17, 1931), American illustrator and graphic designer. Biography He played the piano at summer resorts in the Catskill Mountains, New York, to pay his school tuition. He attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art (1948‚Äì1951), Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1951), City College of New York (1952, 1955). When he graduated he became a professional graphic designer in New York City. Gill acted as a film title designer in several films, including several films of Ray Harryhausen. In 1960 after an interview in a New York hotel room for a job in London, he moved to the UK to work for Charles Hobson. April Fool's Day, 1962, Gill, Alan Fletcher and Colin Forbes established Fletcher/Forbes/Gill design studio, the forerunner of Pentagram. F/F/G soon outgrew their small studio and moved into a huge Victorian former gun factory on a canal. They started the Designers and Art Directors Association D&AD; and opened a second office in Geneva. In 1967, Gill left the partnership and assumed independent freelancing again, including teaching, filmmaking and writing children‚Äôs books. He returned to New York in 1975 to write and design Beatlemania, the largest multimedia musical up to that time on Broadway, on which he worked with Robert Rabinowitz. He also proposed a peace monument for Times Square, Gill wanted to collect military junk from all over the world, pile it 40 feet high, spray it matte black, and mount it on a block of white marble. The New York City Fine Arts Commission did not like the idea. For his graphic design work, Gill has won a number of awards, sold illustrations to Esquire, Architectural Forum, Fortune, Seventeen, and The Nation magazines and has illustrated children‚Äôs books and designed film titles. He has also designed for Apple Corps records, Rainbow Theatre, Pirelli, Nestl√©, CBS, Universal Pictures, Joseph Losey, Queen (now Harpers & Queen), High Times magazines and the United Nations.

Peritubular capillaries surround the cortical parts of the proximal and distal tubules, while the vasa recta go into the medulla to approach the loop of Henle. About one-fifth of the blood plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries; four-fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries. Ions and minerals that need to be saved in the body are reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries through active transport, secondary active transport, or transcytosis. The ions that need to be excreted as waste are secreted from the capillaries into the nephron to be sent towards the bladder and out of the body. Essentially, the peritubular capillaries reabsorb useful substances such as glucose and amino acids and secrete certain mineral ions and excess water into the tubule. The majority of exchange through the peritubular capillaries occurs because of chemical gradients osmosis and hydrostatic pressure. Movement of water into the peritubular capillaries is due to the loss of water from the glomerulus during filtration, which increases the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood. This blood leaves the glomerulus via the efferent arteriole, which supplies the peritubular capillaries. The higher osmolarity of the blood in the peritubular capillaries creates an osmotic pressure which causes the uptake of water. Other ions can be taken up by the peritubular capillaries via solvent drag. Water is also driven into the peritubular capillaries due to the higher fluid pressure of the interstitium, driven by reabsorption of fluid and electrolytes via active transport, and the low fluid pressure of blood entering the peritubular capillaries due to the narrowness of the efferent arteriole.

The airfield was completed in May 1942, and in June, Greenville Army Air Base was officially activated as a B-25 Mitchell medium twin-engine bomber training base. Greenville AAB was assigned to the III Bomber Command of the Third Air Force. The 342d Army Air Force Base Unit was assigned as the host unit for the airfield. The 342d provided such as logistics, maintenance, facilities, security and general administration. Isaqueena Bombing Range was established on and near Lake Isaqueena in the Clemson University Experimental Forest about to the west. Greenville AAB also controlled Coronaca Army Airfield as a sub- base for its training mission. The operational training unit (OTU) at Greenville AAB was the 334th Bombardment Group, being assigned on 16 July 1942. Its flying squadrons were the 470th, 471st, 472nd, and 473rd Bombardment squadrons, flying B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. The 334th's mission was to provide flying training to personnel and bomber crews. The 334th was inactivated on 1 May 1944 with personnel and equipment being reassigned to the 330th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit/Medium Bombardment). On 1 January 1945, the 330th was redesignated as the 128th Army Air Force Base Unit in conjunction with the base's reassignment to the First Air Force. The 56th Combat Training Wing became the overall commanding unit at Greenville AAB on 1 May 1945, being reassigned from Morris Field, North Carolina which was closed. Its mission was to perform training and processing of bombardment replacement crews for overseas duty and the training of permanent party instructor personnel with the view of qualifying all personnel assigned for overseas duty. 90th Bombardment Group The first combat unit assigned to Greenville for training was the 90th Bomb Group (Heavy), which was assigned on 21 June 1942 and flew Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. The unit consisted of four squadrons: 319th, 320th, 321st, and 400th Bombardment Squadrons. With its training completed, the group transferred to Ypsilanti, Michigan on 18 August 1942 for follow-on training near Ford's Willow Run aircraft manufacturing plant. After another transfer (to Hickam Field in Hawaii), in early November 1942, the 90th BG transferred to the Pacific theater, being stationed at Townsville, Queensland, Australia with the Fifth Air Force. 310th Bombardment Group The 310th Bomb Group (Medium) trained at Greenville Army Air Base between 18 September and 17 October 1942, flying North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. The unit consisted of four squadrons: 379th, 380th, 381st, and 428th Bombardment Squadrons. With its training completed, the group went overseas, transferring to M√©diouna Airfield, in French Morocco with the Twelfth Air Force. With the departure of the 310th, the 334th began training personnel for assignment as replacements, rather than complete bomb groups. After training was completed, the personnel would be assigned overseas to existing units in the wartime theaters. =Photographs= Photographs of the WWII base and soldiers can be viewed in the Greenville County Library System digital collections. =Postwar era= C-46 Commando In the summer of 1945, with the war coming to an end, a number of training bases were slated for closure. This included Greenville Army Air Base, which was placed on standby status in November 1945. However, there were plans made by the Army Air Force for its continuing use. One of the lessons of World War II was that the airplane was invaluable in the support of ground forces, both in the close air support and transport role. Tactical Air Command (TAC) was established as one of the post-war Army Air Forces' three major commands. The USAAF Troop Carrier Command (TCC) was inactivated as part of this reorganization and the Third Air Force was reassigned from the disbanding Continental Air Forces. TAC assumed command of the Troop Carrier transport mission and assigned it to the Third Air Force on 21 March 1946, which was assigned to Greenville AAB. At Greenville, the Third Air Force was assigned a mixture of C-46 Commando and C-47 Skytrain aircraft and several Air Force Reserve troop carrier groups. Also, surplus C-54 Skymasters that had been originally purchased for Air Transport Command (ATC) were made available for troop carrier use. The Third Air Force was inactivated on 1 November 1946, being replaced by the Ninth Air Force, which had just returned from Europe. With the establishment of the United States Air Force as an independent service branch in September 1947, the airfield was renamed Greenville Air Force Base. In the late 1940s many of TAC's Troop Carrier Groups/Wings were assigned directly to HQ TAC with the rest to the Air Force Reserve' Fourteenth Air Force and 302d Air Division. Greenville AFB remained an administrative facility for several years, maintaining aircraft and providing training to these Air Force Reserve units. During the Berlin Blockade in 1948, Air Force Reserve troop carrier groups at Greenville AFB deployed C-54s to Germany to replace the C-47s that began the Berlin Airlift to sustain the 'Gro√üstadt'. At least one C-82 Packet, an early version of the C-119 Flying Boxcar, also participated in the airlift for several weeks. In 1949, a 0.5-mile dirt car racing track was built just south of the base. The track took the name \\"Air Base Speedway\\", as a nod to the nearby airfield. The track held a NASCAR Grand National race on August 25th, 1951. Noted race driver Bob Flock won the race in an Oldsmobile. The track closed down in 1952. =Korean War= C-119 \\"Flying Boxcar\\" The theater troop carrier mission was expanded rapidly during the Korean War when many of these reserve units were elevated to active service and assigned directly to HQ TAC. HQ TAC ordered the 315th Troop Carrier Group to deploy from Greenville AFB to Brady Air Base, Japan with C-46 Commando transports. Also the 314th Troop Carrier Group was ordered to Japan with the new C-119 Flying Boxcar to support the United Nations forces in the conflict. The 314th was ordered to Japan primarily to support the 187th Regimental Combat Team, a United States Army airborne unit that was on its way to Japan by ship, but when the aircrews arrived, they found themselves heavily involved in logistical support operations between Japan and South Korea as well as performing combat cargo airdrops and the occasional airborne parachute operation. On 16 October 1950, the 375th Troop Carrier Wing was activated at Greenville AFB. The 375th was an Air Force Reserve unit previously based at Greater Pittsburgh Airport. After a period of intensive training, the C-82s of the 375th participated in troop carrier and airlift operations, paratroop drops, and other exercises until being returned to the reserves in July 1952. Its aircraft at Donaldson were taken over by the newly activated 17th Troop Carrier squadron. The older C-82s were replaced by C-119s in 1953 and the 17th remained on active duty until 21 July 1954 when it returned to reserve status. Also on 16 October 1950, the Air Force Reserve's 433d Troop Carrier Wing was activated, its three squadrons flying the C-119. On 20 July 1951, the wing was reassigned to USAFE and ordered to Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany. The 57th Troop Carrier Squadron flew the C-82 Packet and C-45 cargo planes. Between 20 February and 11 April 1952, the unit operated on temporary duty from Brownwood Municipal Airport, performing paratroop drops and other exercises in support of Army maneuvers. =Eighteenth Air Force operations= USAF C-124 Globemaster II In March 1951 the base was renamed 'Donaldson Air Force Base' and on 26 June, the Eighteenth Air Force was activated in 1951 to discharge Tactical Air Command's troop carrier responsibilities. Its mission was to organize, administer, equip, train, and prepare for combat troop carrier missions. The Eighteenth Air Force inherited nine continental \\"medium\\" troop carrier wings (314th, 375th, 403d, 433d, 434th, 435th, 443d, 514th and 515th), seven of which were Air Force Reserve wings called to active duty during the Korean War. The command added a \\"heavy\\" (C-124) wing (62d) in the Fall of 1951 and another in early 1953 (463d). One of those reserve wings, the 443d Troop Carrier, was deployed for active duty at Donaldson on 9 August 1951 as a training wing. For almost two years, the 443d participated in tactical exercises in operations, training troop carrier aircrews using C-46 Commandoes for assignment to the Far East and worked closely with other troop carrier groups to test and evaluate new troop carrier doctrine and procedures. With the end of the Korean War, the 443d was inactivated on 8 June 1953. With the departure of the 443d, it was decided to bring Donaldson up to being an operational transport base. On 15 October 1953 the 63d Troop Carrier Wing was transferred from Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, to Donaldson. The 63d flew the longer-range C-124 \\"Globemaster II\\" and became the host unit at Donaldson AFB until its closure in 1963. Its attached units consisted of: * Groups : 61st Troop Carrier (25 August 1954 ‚àí 8 October 1959) : 63d Troop Carrier (15 October 1953 ‚àí 18 January 1963) : 64th Troop Carrier (15 October 1953 ‚àí 15 February 1954) * Squadrons : 9th Troop Carrier (1953‚Äì1957) : 15th Troop Carrier (1954‚Äì1963) : 52d Troop Carrier (1953‚Äì1957) : 309th Troop Carrier (1954‚Äì1956) The 63d TCW participated in maneuvers, exercises and the airlift of personnel and cargo to many points throughout the world, it helped evacuate Hungarian refugees, supported the construction of the eastern mission test range, and the Distant Early Warning Line sites in the Arctic. The next year, the Eighteenth Air Force C-119s from the 483rd Troop Carrier Wing; flown by civilian crews employed by the Central Intelligence Agency Civil Air Transport airdropped supplies to besieged French paratroops at Dien Bien Phu. Some 483rd personnel flew missions in an unofficial capacity, some of whom would play key roles in the troop carrier mission in later years. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 374th TCW and TAC C-124s airlifted wounded French soldiers out of Indochina to Japan. Throughout the mid-1950s, Donaldson Air Force Base supported USAF troop carrier participation in joint operations training. Eighteenth Air Force squadrons took part in joint exercises and provided support for airborne paratroop training. Additional endeavors were implemented to improve communications capabilities and to include AF medical air evacuation in joint exercises. Airlift support was provided to other USAF major commands and to other Tactical Air Command (TAC) organizations. Two helicopter squadrons, the 21st and 54th, flying the Piasecki H-21, were assigned to the Eighteenth Air Force in 1956 and 1957. Their mission was for the purpose of providing the US Army with air support in a fashion similar to the TAC Troop Carrier Squadrons. The Army, however, declined all support from the Air Force helicopters, and the 21st/54th Helicopter Squadron turned to flying airlift support, search and recovery missions, and also cooperated with a communications group in an experiment to lay communications lines by helicopter. Prior to inactivation, the unit flew photo, airlift, and radiological survey missions during atomic testing at the Nevada Test Site. =Military Air Transport Service= A realignment of Troop Carrier forces in 1957 led to the Eighteenth Air Force's C-124 wings being reassigned to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). The command's headquarters was also moved to Connally AFB, Texas on 1 September 1957 when Donaldson AFB was turned over to MATS along with the C-124s and 63d TCW assigned there. MATS C-124s from Donaldson flew the large aircraft all over the globe. Large hangars and expansive ramps were constructed to support these sizeable machines; the base became known as the \\"Troop Carrier Capital of the World\\". 1958 Lebanon crisis C-124 on the ramp at Beirut Airport, Lebanon, 1958 C-124 at Hamilton AFB, California being prepared to load a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter being transported to Formosa, 1958 In 1958 the Eisenhower Administration received an urgent call for assistance from the Middle East. The government of Lebanon was being threatened with attack. Sorely needed troops and supplies had to be airlifted to Lebanon as soon as possible, and it also had to be done without public knowledge, so as not to inform a possible enemy of the deployment of US troops. A task force of 36 MATS C-124s, with a significant number from the 63d TCW based at Donaldson were dispatched from the United States to Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany to assist in the airlift, deploying Army and Marine units along with their weapons and equipment to Beirut. 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis Also in 1958 the Chinese Communists were shelling Quemoy and threatening Matsu. These tiny islands in the Straits of Formosa are the closest Nationalist Chinese territory to the mainland of China. By using heavy artillery fire, the Communists appeared to be softening up the islands in preparation for invasion. Tactical Air Command was ordered to organize and send a Composite Air Strike Force to Formosa (now Taiwan). C-124s, some from the 63d TCW at Donaldson, transported F-104 Starfighter aircraft from Hamilton AFB, California along with their pilots, ground crews, and maintenance equipment and delivered them intact to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base. This operation marked a historical milestone as it was the first time that a complete operational Air Force squadron was airlifted in a single- package operation. Congo Crisis During the Congo Crisis in 1962, the 63d TCW deployed C-124s to fly United Nations troops and their equipment to central Africa. In addition to the troops, the aircraft also airlifted badly needed food to the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville). In the initial phase of the airlift, MATS C-124s carried more than 4,000 troops from five different nations, in addition to thousands of tons of food and equipment. Included in these shipments flown in by MATS were such items as communications facilities, maintenance equipment, helicopters, liaison planes, and even complete mess halls. At some points the airlift was a two-way shuttle ‚àí ferrying in UN soldiers and flying out returning Belgian troops, or UN troops that had been replaced, to their homelands. MATS also made emergency trips, flying the from Leopoldville to Stanleyville, and back, to rescue threatened refugees. C-124s flying to and from utilized the USAFE base at Ch√¢teauroux, France as a transshipment point for cargo arriving from the United States. Laotian Civil War In 1962, communist guerrillas in Laos had driven the Royal Lao Army before them and had captured two important cities. Now they were pushing toward the Mekong River which separates Laos from Thailand. The United States, under the terms of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, was meeting its defense obligations to Thailand. MATS C-124s were deployed to Don Muang Airport near Bangkok. 63d TCW heavy air transports were taking off every fifteen minutes from Don Muang to Udon RTAFB carrying Thai and United States Marines with their equipment some to the northeast to \\"show the flag\\", as well as put an armed force along the Mekong River. The Communist guerrilla forces did not cross the Mekong. This was the first large-scale landing of US combat troops and the first in Southeast Asia since the Korean War, and foreshadowed the large United States presence in Southeast Asia in the coming years during the Vietnam War. =Closure= In December 1962, the Air Force announced plans to close the base permanently due to budget reductions. Donaldson AFB was declared surplus in 1963 and steps were taken to deed the property back to the City and County of Greenville. In January 1963, the 63d Troop Carrier Wing was transferred to Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia and Donaldson AFB was deactivated for the last time. Under the terms of an earlier reversionary clause, the entire were offered \\"as is\\". The City and County accepted the offer, and took title of the facilities on 25 January 1963. Legacy The facilities and land of the former Donaldson AFB were returned to the City and County of Greenville and were renamed Donaldson Center Airport. Among the over 75 tenants of the industrial air park are Lockheed Martin; which services USAF, USN and USMC C-130s and USN P-3s there; Stevens Aviation (a 1950 spinoff of J.P. Stevens CompanyStevens Aviation ‚Äì History ); 3M; Alan Pittman Race Cars (a fabricator of Pro Modified cars); the Greenville County Sheriff's Office Southern Area Command (SAC) and facilities supporting the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Reserves. Donaldson's presence also led to the establishment of Greenville's first restaurant serving pizza. Julius N. Capri of Altoona, Pennsylvania was stationed at Greenville Army Air Base in 1944, and placed in charge of its civilian mechanics. After World War II, Capri's family opened the first of what later became several Italian restaurants near the base on Augusta Road.

It always falls on the day after the Eastern Christian Easter (following the custom of the largest Christian denomination in the country, the Coptic Orthodox Church). The holiday is celebrated by modern average Egyptians and Copts, it is considered a national festival in Egypt. The main features of the festival are: * People spend all day out picnicking in any space of green, public gardens, on the Nile, or at the zoo. * Traditional food eaten on this day consists mainly of fesikh (a fermented, salted and dried grey mullet), lettuce, scallions or green onions, tirmis, and colored boiled eggs. History According to annals written by Plutarch during the 1st century AD, the Ancient Egyptians used to offer salted fish, lettuce, and onions to their deities during the spring festival known as Shemu.Al Ahram Weekly After the Christianization of Egypt, the festival became associated with the other Christian spring festival, Easter. Over time, Shemu morphed into its current form and its current date, and by the time of the Islamic conquest of Egypt, the holiday was settled on Easter Monday. The Islamic calendar being lunar and thus unfixed relative to the solar year, the date of Sham el-Nessim remained on the Christian-linked date.

It was first found in deposits of the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation, which date to around 165 to 161 million years ago. Although originally twelve specimens were assigned to the taxon, at least one of them may belong to a different genus. Patagosaurus probably lived alongside genera as Piatnitzkysaurus, Condorraptor, and Volkheimeria. Since Patagosaurus is known from many specimens, including at least one juvenile, its anatomy and growth are fairly well understood. Both ages exhibit the typical features of a sauropod, a long neck, small head, a long tail, and being quadrupedal. The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, pectoral girdle, pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar. The many known specimens help fill in gaps in the anatomy of the genus, such as the forelimb and skull. Parts of the skeleton, like the pectoral girdle, tibia, and pubis are more robust, while others, like the forelimb and ischium, are more gracile. The material of Patagosaurus is similar to closely related taxa like Cetiosaurus and Volkheimeria, more primitive genera such as Barapasaurus and Amygdalodon, and more derived sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus.  Discovery and naming  In the 1970s many specimens of a previously unidentified dinosaur were found associated together in the same bed and locality: a pebbly stratum near a route to Cerro Condor. The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. For the fossil he erected the genus Patagosaurus, as well as its type species P. fariasi. The generic name of Patagosaurus comes from the location of its find in Patagonia, and the fact that it is a reptile. The specific name honours Ricardo Farias, on whose land the initial discovery was made. The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype, and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species, so more specimens are probably this taxon. Its skeleton was found near those of Piatnitzkysaurus and Volkheimeria in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation. Patagosaurus is almost completely known with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton, including parts of the skull. Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species, although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon. Bonaparte (1986) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170, PVL 4076, MACN CH 934, and MACN CH 933 to the genus. While the holotype includes a postcranial skeleton, the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull. MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of Patagosaurus, which confirms its association with the genus. A specimen first referred to Patagosaurus in 2003, MPEF-PV 1670 (which includes just a lower jaw), is also very similar to MACN CH 933, and differences can be associated with age, so therefore, MPEF-PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material. However, the teeth of MACN CH 934 are very different from those of both lower jaws (MACN CH 933 and MPEF-PV 1670), so it can be identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as Patagosaurus. Thus, the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170, MACN CH 933, and MPEF-PV 1670.  Description  Size comparison with a human Patagosaurus is a sauropod that possessed a general and unspecialized bauplan of being quadrupedal, having an elongate neck, a small head, and a very long tail. Therefore, it is similar to Cetiosaurus and other related genera, who possessed the same morphology. It has been estimated that it was about long and weighed about . An earlier estimate by John S. McIntosh and his colleagues in 1997, found that Patagosaurus was approximately long, and also in weight, similar to the later estimates by Holtz. A 2006 study by Donald M. Henderson calculated the weight of Patagosaurus to be , a smaller estimate than McIntosh's. The skull of Patagosaurus is not very well known, with a 2003 revision by Oliver Rauhut determining only a few jaws are certainly referrable to it, as opposed to nearly the entire skull. MPEF-PV 1670 shows what the morphology of the adult or subadult skull was like, while MACN CH 933 represents a juvenile individual. Based upon how broad, high and short the adult articulated mandibles of Patagosaurus are, its snout would have been short, high and broad as well, a typical feature of most sauropods. The teeth of Patagosaurus are reminiscent of more derived sauropods. They are similar in morphology to Euhelopus, being concave on one side as well as having crowns with fairly great expansions. They are also similar to Camarasaurus, although the latter genus has less of a concavity and expansion. The teeth also possess marginal denticles on the crown. Based on histological studies, an individual of Patagosaurus would have replaced all its teeth within 58 days, similar to 62 days for Camarasaurus, and 34 days for Diplodocus. = Postcranial skeleton = Cervical vertebra in right lateral view Most of the postcranial skeleton is known in Patagosaurus. The cervical, caudal, and dorsal vertebrae are generally similar to Camarasaurus, although the sacrum possesses many distinct features. The sacrum is well-preserved, showing that Patagosaurus possessed five sacral vertebrae. All the vertebrae but the fifth are fused together. All the neural spines are tall, and the centra are occasionally transversely narrow. The neural canal of the vertebrae is unique among sauropods however. Starting from the very end of the first vertebra, and extending to almost the end of the third there is an enlargement of the canal, forming a well-defined cavity. Even though the sacrum itself is distinguishing, its sacral ribs resemble Camarasaurus. The sacral vertebrae have a total length of , with the total sacral length being . The pelvic girdle is well-preserved and well studied. In the holotype, the pelvic girdle is almost complete, only lacking the proximal ends of each ischium. The ilia of the holotype are well known, and show many distinct features. The pubic peduncle, where the ilium articulates with the pubis, is long and straight and has an expansion on the end, as in many sauropods. The upper edge of the iliac blade is curved and thick, with rugosities (rough spots) for cartilage attachment. The pubic elements are large and robust in adults, more so than in juveniles. They are flat when viewed from in front, and convex when seen from behind. Lapparentosaurus resembles Patagosaurus when comparing their pubes. The ischia are much more gracile than the pubes, and only have a small distal expansion. While the ilia resemble Barapasaurus, and the pubes resemble Lapparentosaurus, the ischia are most similar to Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. Restoration The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus are based on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single additional bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. In the juvenile, the fourth trochanter is completely in the proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered. The pectoral girdle is well known. Both the left and right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the pectoral girdle, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus. The forelimbs of Patagosaurus are only based on three bones from the juvenile specimen, and no manual elements are preserved. The humeri are slender and elongate, lacking great proximal and distal expansions. The incomplete deltoid crest, only shows that it was wide, and likely had a projection below and behind. Like the humeri, the radius is slender, and lacks large expansions on either end. On the edge closest to the ulna, the radius possesses a ridge along its edge, which corresponds to where radioulnar ligaments would have attached. The ulna is complete, although sediment-filled breaks might have altered its original shape. The forelimb of Patagosaurus is much more gracile and different from the robust later sauropods like Camarasaurus, and Apatosaurus, and instead resembles more Diplodocus.  Classification  When originally described, Patagosaurus was identified as a relative of Cetiosaurus in the family Cetiosauridae. It can be distinguished from Cetiosaurus, a similar genus, by features of the ischium and vertebrae. Another genus also identified as a cetiosaurid by Bonaparte, Volkheimeria, was named in the same paper as Patagosaurus. Features uniting the genera were identified in the pelvic structure and vertebrae, specifically the caudal neural spines and the ilium and ischium. These characteristics show that the genera are more derived than Amygdalodon, yet more primitive than Haplocanthosaurus. Later in 1995, Paul Upchurch published a paper on early sauropods, finding Patagosaurus as a cetiosaurid again. He found that although earlier works had distinguished two groups, the shunosaurines and cetiosaurines, in the family, but that Shunosaurus and relatives were actually closer to Euhelopus, and cetiosaurines (Cetiosaurus, Patagosaurus and Amygdalodon) were the only true cetiosaurids. Upchurch noted however that further work on the group might reveal different conclusions. Two cranial specimens, MPEF-PV 1670 and MACN-CH 933 In a 2009 revision of Euhelopus, Jeffrey A. Wilson and Upchurch published a joint analysis on primitive eusauropodan relationships. They found that Patagosaurus was in fact not a sister taxon of Cetiosaurus, but instead more basal than the genus, effectively invalidating Cetiosauridae. Their results are shown below:  Paleoecology  Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation location and map Patagosaurus was uncovered in the Middle Jurassic Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation, which preserves a large variety of flora and fauna. In fact, Escapa et al. noted that \\"the fossil record of this formation represents the most completely known biota from the continental Middle to Late Jurassic of the Southern Hemisphere and one of the most complete of the entire world\\". The Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Formation, which was deposited about 165 to 161 million years ago, was a lush ecosystem, in which many organisms lived. In the Middle Jurassic, the region would have been part of the great southern landmass of Gondwana. Most of the plants are conifers, although ferns and equisetales are also abundant. Directly below the formation is a layer of ash, indicating a nearby volcano. The fauna is dominated by tetrapods, ranging from aquatic amphibians to terrestrial turtles, mammals, and dinosaurs. The sole amphibian known is Notobatrachus; turtles are represented by a distinct form that was named Condorchelys; mammals are known from a few genera, including Argentoconodon, Asfaltomylos, and Henosferus; multiple dinosaurs have been identified, including the sauropods Volkheimeria, Patagosaurus, and a potential third genus that is yet unnamed, and theropods include the related Piatnitzkysaurus and Condorraptor.

The measure was enacted by the prime minister after he was authorized by Parliament to take legislative measures to stimulate employment. Unlike the later First Employment Contract (CPE) which was repealed in 2010 (soon after its enactment), after protests the CNE has been used as a job contract despite opposition from trade unions.  Background  The CNE was created by the French government as part of its June 2005 Emergency Employment Plan to fight France's high unemployment. The plan aimed to create jobs by giving flexibility to small businesses, since many employers blame their inability to hire on rigid French labour laws. One of the most frequent claims by employers and the employers' union (MEDEF) has been inflexibility regarding layoffs.  Clauses  = Small companies = The CNE applies only to new permanent employees, of any age, in firms with no more than 20 employees. = First-two- years contract-termination clause = The contract allows employers to fire at will during the first two years of employment, after which legal justification is required. The flexibility clause was a major break with the protective conditions usually applying to long-term job contracts in France. Under the usual long-term job contract, an employer needs to justify the firing of an employee.National strikes pose first big challenge for French prime minister ‚Äî The Guardian, October 4, 2005 If an employer terminates the contract during its first two years, they must provide advance notice of two weeks to one month. An employee may terminate the contract with no advance notice during its first two years. After the first two years the contract is identical to the existing long-term contract, with protective measures for the employee. The CNE also limits to 12 months the period during which an employee can contest their firing before labor-law courts; in ordinary contracts, the period is 30 years. =Burden of proof in litigation= Under normal long-term labour contracts, an employer bears the burden of proof as the defendant; if the plaintiff is the fired employee, the employer must justify the firing. This is known as the reversal of burden of proof, and is based on the legal justification provided to fire the employee. This 1973 law was enacted under Pierre Messmer's prime ministry during Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing's presidency. Pierre Mesmer had succeeded Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who after May 1968 had a \\"new society project\\" aiming to modernize France. This included social measures, although Giscard d'Estaing and the ministers supported economic liberalism. Although at first the CNE said that \\"no motive\\" had to be given during the first two years, a Conseil d'Etat ruling in October 2005 imposed such a motive in litigation. If a plaintiff (employee) alleges they have been fired due to discrimination based on religion, political opinion, physical disability, age or sexual orientation, the Conseil d'Etat ruled to reverse the burden of proof to the employer's side. For other claims, the burden of proof remains on the employee side. Avoiding the risk of court procedures is a key issue behind the CNE. With the similar CPE contract discussions, opponents (unions and opposition leaders) have supported the reversal of burden of proof to the employer in all employment cases. Recouvrement - emploi - assurance ch√¥mage, Le CPE valid√© par le Conseil constitutionnel. Une nouvelle loi en pr√©paration.\\" Annuaire-S√©cu.com Chat with Bruno Julliard, leader of the Union Nationale des √âtudiants de France (UNEF) students' union.Text (doc. format, available in html) by Bernard Friot, sociology teacher at Paris-X  Support  = Improvement through flexibility= According to Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, easier firing would make small companies less reluctant to hire new employees. This idea is not new; employers and economists have been asking for more flexibility, and consider that globalization makes protective labour law unaffordable. \\"The issue of flexibility must be addressed, and quickly\\", said the leader of CGPME (France's association of SMEs) and Laurence Parisot, leader of MEDEF (France's major employers' union). MEDEF and CGPME expected the government to push for stronger reforms. The two- year period gives flexibility to small companies, who will be able to hire without the probation-period deadline of long-term contracts. The \\"no justification\\" clause is a key issue, since \\"employers often also argue that the tribunal is heavily prejudiced in favour of the employee\\". The CNE is in line with International Monetary Fund (IMF) advice to \\"introduce flexibility in the French labour market\\", and the IMF called CNEs a \\"first step\\" towards reform. After the First Employment Contract was discontinued, a survey showed that 57 percent of small employers feared that the CNE might also be scrapped. = Improved flexibility, reduced unemployment = The prime minister claimed that the CNE was a \\"necessary measure\\" to tackle unemployment, since \\"one third of those recruited would not have found jobs [without the CNE]\\". Nearly 500,000 CNEs have been signed, according to Dominique de Villepin in May 2006, demonstrating that small businesses favor the contract. According to supporters, the CNE's primary advantage is the creation of jobs which would not have existed without the law; this indicates that improved employer flexibility helps reduce unemployment. Estimates of the number of jobs created because of CNEs vary according to sources, from 80,000 per year (INSEE National Institute of Statistics extrapolations) to 29 percent of all CNEs (Ifop, December 2005). A June 2006 Les √âchos study is the latest available study, and the first one based on actual figures. According to the study 440,000 CNE contracts were signed between August 2005 and April 2006, 10 percent (44,000) of which would not have existed under existing job contracts. This is significant, since there were only 50,000 private-sector jobs created in 2005. The study also showed that an additional 20 percent of jobs would have been delayed without a CNE, demonstrating employers' reluctance to hire under existing long-term contracts. = Employee benefits = One consequence of the two-year probation is flexibility for employees, who are free to change jobs during their first two years without the usual one- to three-month advance notice required by long-term contracts. The 2006 Les Echos study demonstrated that more CNE contracts were terminated by employees (45 percent) than by employers (38 percent).  Opposition  The CNE law passed quietly in August 2005, with less opposition than that sparked by the CPE since it applies to non-unionized businesses. However, its repeal was a primary goal of demonstrations held on October 4, 2005. After the April 2006 cancellation of the First Employment Contract, unions have increased pressure to cancel this contract; they contend that it creates precarious work for employees, endangering job security. Opponents of the law argue that the new \\"flexibility\\" negates labour laws which the workers' movement secured after decades of struggle. They argue that it may be difficult to counter the inversion of the burden of the proof introduced by the new contract (for example, if an employee is fired because of psychological pressure such as sexual harassment). In contrast to a CDI contract, CNE employees are at a disadvantage in obtaining credit or housing. This claim, however, has been denied by banks. After the February 20, 2006 judgment (see below), the CGT trade union declared that \\"the magistrate has put in evidence the embezzlement of the CNE and the abusive character of the rupture\\": \\"it is the principle itself of the CNE which allows such illegitimate use: by suppressing the guaranties which protect against abusive firing, the CNE favorize all arbitrary bosses' behavior\\".Premi√®re condamnation des prud'hommes contre un employeur ‚Äî Le Monde, 22 February 2006. On April 28, 2006 a local labour court (conseil des prud'hommes) ruled the two-year \\"fire at will\\" period \\"unreasonable\\" and contrary to convention umber 158 of the International Labour Organization (ratified by France), which states that an employee \\"cannot be fired without any legitimate motive...before offering him the possibility to defend himself\\".Un contrat en CNE jug√© contraire au droit international ‚Äî Reuters, April 28, 2006 .  Impact  In April 2006, estimates of the number of CNE employees varied from 320,000 (ACOSS governmental numbers ) to 400,000 (Les Echos economical newspaper's numbers Les embauches en CNE restent √©lev√©es malgr√© la mont√©e du d√©bat sur la pr√©carit√© ‚Äî Les Echos, April 19, 2006 .). According to IFOP, a polling company headed by Laurence Parisot (leader of the MEDEF employers' union), 29 percent of CNE jobs would not have existed without the CNE (in other words, from 106,000 to 133,000 CNE jobs would not have been filled during its first seven months). This poll was used to confirm Villepin's claim that \\"a third of the jobs\\" would not have been created otherwise. This contradicted an INSEE (National Institute of Statistics) estimate that it would create (at most) 40,000 to 80,000 jobs a year. In May 2006, Prime Minister de Villepin said that \\"almost 500,000 contracts\\" were signed. In June 2006, Echos released the first CNE study based on actual figures. According to this study: *440,000 CNE contracts were signed from August 2005 to April 2006. *10 percent (44,000) were for jobs which would not have existed without the CNE. *The 44,000 jobs compares with the 50,000 long-term private-sector jobs created in France in 2005. *Over 11% of contracts were cancelled within the two-year probation period. *More CNEs were cancelled by employees (45 percent) than by employers (38 percent). According to Echos, the CNE created nearly as many jobs in 10 months as the private sector did for all of 2005 (about 50,000). = INSEE and ACOSS = The French National Institute for Statistics (INSEE) calculated a lower number, estimating that CNEs will create a net 10,000 to 20,000 jobs each trimester (40,000 to 80,000 jobs per year). The impact of CNEs has been questioned by Le Canard encha√Æn√©, which quoted the INSEE study, the ANPE's records and trade unions. Since the more-recent First Employment Contract (CPE) was rejected after months of protest, unions have also been trying to cancel the CNE. On the other hand, employers' unions (Medef) consider it a major reform. The Canard Encha√Æn√© said that the governmental ACOSS numbers (400,000 contracts) was an inflated estimate. ACOSS later reduced the figure by 20 percent, to 320,000. According to the ANPE (the Department of Labour), 600 CNEs had been signed by August 19, 2005 (two weeks after its introduction). The Canard Encha√Æn√© considers the number of jobs created (as calculated by INSEE) \\"a drop in the ocean\\". Several CNEs were challenged in court. Confronted with multiple reversals of firings because of \\"abuse of right\\", \\"the CGPME, organisation of small employers, gave as instructions to its members to justify from now on ruptures\\" (i.e. to not implement CNEs).Cf. Le Canard encha√Æn√© of April 5, 2006, n¬∞ 4458, \\"CPE, CNE, DCD\\" en Une de l'hebdomadaire An April 28, 2006 judgment reinstated the CNE.  Court decisions  The CNE has been challenged several times in court. On October 17, 2005 the Conseil d'Etat, France's supreme court, declared the two-year \\"fire-at-will\\" period \\"reasonable\\" and in accordance with convention 158 of the International Labour Organization. The Conseil d'Etat declared that if a firing is unjustified, \\"this does not mean that it has no motive, nor that the judge, seized by the employee, shouldn't determine it [the motive of the rupture] nor control it\\".Le r√¥le d√©cisif du Conseil Constitutionnel ‚Äî Le Monde, March 30, 2006 . Other examples of unjustified firing include the firing of pregnant women or sick people, someone with undesirable religious or political opinions, someone who has been harassed (sexually or otherwise), a union representative or someone fired on racial grounds.Salari√©s et employeurs, vous avez √©t√© tromp√©s ‚Äî Le Monde, February 10, 2006 . In an unprecedented decision, on February 20, 2006 a labour-law court in Longjumeau (Essonne) ordered an employer to pay ‚Ç¨17,500 in damages for \\"abusive rupture of the trial period\\" and \\"rupture of the consolidation period\\" (the two-year \\"fire-at-will\\" period). A 51-year-old auto-industry employee had been hired on May 21, 2005 by a small firm (PME) with an ordinary, indeterminate contract (CDI). On August 6, 2005 (two days after the CNE law was enacted) he was fired, and hired by another PME for the same job at the same place with a CNE. On August 30, 2005, he was fired a second time. The CGT claimed that the \\"CNE favorized arbitrary bosses' behavior\\".'' On April 28, 2006, after the CPE's repeal, the Longjumeau conseil des prud'hommes (labour law court) ruled Conseil de Prud‚Äôhommes de LONGJUMEAU, Section activit√©s diverses, 28 avril 2006, RG N¬∞F 06/00316. ‚Äî David TATE, . that the CNE was contrary to international law, \\"illegitimate\\" and \\"without any judicial value\\". The court considered the two-year \\"fire at will\\" period \\"unreasonable\\" and contravened convention 158 of the International Labour Organization (ratified by France). The court ruled on the case of Linda de Wee, who had been hired with a CDD (temporary contract) on July 1, 2005 as a secretary. At the end of her six- month term, she was hired by the same employer on January 1, 2006 with a CNE contract. The court redefined the contract as a CDI (permanent contract). CGT trade union leader Bernard Thibault hoped that the decision would mark the end of the controversial contract.Bernard Thibault au plus haut ‚Äî L'Express, 28 April 2006 . On July 6, 2007, the Court of Appeal of Paris Cour d‚Äôappel de PARIS, 18√®me Chambre E, 6 juillet 2007, S 06-06992.. ‚Äî David TATE, . upheld the decision. The International Labour Organization agreed with the French courts in its November 2007 decision (dec-GB.300/20/6), issued at the request of the Force Ouvri√®re trade union. The French government was asked to ensure \\"that 'contracts for new employment' can in no case be terminated in the absence of a valid reason\\".'

An Austro-Hungarian Army officer before and during World War I, he specialised in mountain warfare and logistics, and had been promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) by the end of the war. During the interwar period he joined the Romanian Army, reaching the rank of General-locotenent (major general), and also became an adviser to King Carol. After he spoke out against the government, he asked to be dismissed from the army after being sidelined. In 1941 he left Romania and joined the Waffen-SS as an SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel) under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. Seeing action on the Eastern Front as a regimental commander with the SS Motorised Division Wiking, he later raised and commanded the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, raised the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), and commanded the V SS Mountain Corps. Units under his command committed many crimes against the civilian population of the Independent State of Croatia, German-occupied territory of Serbia and Italian governorate of Montenegro. His final appointment was as plenipotentiary general in south Siebenb√ºrgen (Transylvania) and the Banat, during which he organised the evacuation of the Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) of Siebenb√ºrgen to the Reich. In addition to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, Phleps was awarded the German Cross in Gold, and after he was killed in September 1944, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross. Early life Phleps' birthplace of Birth√§lm in Siebenb√ºrgen (modern-day alt=rural village landscape with old church steeple in the mid-distance and terraced hills in the background Phleps was born in Birth√§lm (Biertan), near Hermannstadt in Siebenb√ºrgen, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (modern-day Transylvania, Romania). At the time, Siebenb√ºrgen was densely populated by ethnic Germans, commonly referred to as Transylvanian Saxons. He was the third son of a surgeon, Dr. Gustav Phleps and Sophie (n√©e Stolz), the daughter of a peasant. Both families had lived in Siebenb√ºrgen for centuries. After finishing the Lutheran Realschule school in Hermannstadt, Phleps entered the Imperial and Royal cadet school in Pressburg (modern-day Slovakia) in 1900, and on 1 November 1901 was commissioned as a Leutnant (lieutenant) in the 3rd Regiment of the Tiroler Kaiserj√§ger (mountain infantry). In 1903, Phleps was transferred to the 11th Feldj√§ger (rifle) Battalion in G√ºns (in modern-day Hungary), and in 1905 was accepted into the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He completed his studies in two years, and was endorsed as suitable for service in the General Staff. Following promotion to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he was transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Esseg in Slavonia, then to the 6th Infantry Division in Graz. This was followed by a promotion to Hauptmann (captain) in 1911, along with a position on the staff of the XV Army Corps in Sarajevo. There, he specialised in mobilisation and communications, in the difficult terrain of Bosnia and Herzegovina. World War I At the outbreak of World War I, Phleps was serving with the staff of the 32nd Infantry Division in Budapest. His division was involved in the early stages of the Serbian campaign, during which Phleps was transferred to the operations staff of the Second Army. This Army was soon withdrawn from the Serbian front and deployed via the Carpathian Mountains to the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (modern-day Poland and Ukraine), to defend against a successful offensive by the Russian Imperial army. The Second Army continued to fight the Russians in and around the Carpathians through the winter of 1914‚Äì1915. In 1915 Phleps was again transferred, this time to Armeegruppe Rohr commanded by General der Kavallerie (General) Franz Rohr von Denta, which was formed in the Austrian Alps, in response to the Italian declaration of war in May 1915. Armeegruppe Rohr became the basis for the formation of the 10th Army, which was headquartered in Villach. Phleps subsequently became the deputy quartermaster of the 10th Army, responsible for organising the supply of the troops fighting the Italians in the mountains. On 1 August 1916, Phleps was promoted to Major. Later that month, King Ferdinand of Romania led the Kingdom of Romania in joining the Triple Entente, subsequently invading Phleps' homeland of Siebenb√ºrgen. On 27 August, Phleps became the chief of staff of the 72nd Infantry Division, which was involved in Austro-Hungarian operations to repel the Romanian invasion. He remained in this theatre of operations for the next two years, ultimately serving as the chief quartermaster of the German 9th Army, and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, on 27 January 1917. In 1918 he returned to the mountains when he was transferred to Armeegruppe Tirol, and ended the war as an Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) and chief quartermaster for the entire Alpine Front. Between the wars After the war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved, and Phleps returned to his homeland, which had become part of the Kingdom of Romania under the Treaty of Trianon. He joined the Romanian Army and was appointed commander of the Saxon National Guard, a militia formed of the German-speaking people of Siebenb√ºrgen. In this role he opposed the Hungarian communist revolutionary government of B√©la Kun, which fought against Romania in 1919. During a battle at the Tisza river against Kun's forces, Phleps disobeyed direct orders and was subsequently court-martialled. The trial concluded that he had saved the Romanian forces through his actions, and he was promoted to Oberst (colonel). He commanded the 84th Infantry Regiment, then joined the general army headquarters and started teaching logistics at the Romanian War Academy in Bucharest. He attended the V Army Corps staff college in Bra»ôov, and published a book titled Logistics: Basics of Organisation and Execution in 1926, which became the standard work on logistics for the Romanian Army. Ironically, after the book was published, Phleps failed his first general's examination on the topic of logistics. He commanded various Romanian units, including the 1st Brigade of the v√¢nƒÉtori de munte (mountain ranger troops), while serving also as a military advisor to King Carol II in the 1930s. Phleps reached the rank of General-locotenent (major general) despite his reported disdain for the corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy of the royal court. After criticising the government's policy and publicly calling King Carol a liar when another general tried to twist his words, he was transferred to the reserves in 1940 and finally dismissed from service at his own request in 1941. World War II Phleps (left) in 1941 =SS Motorised Division Wiking= In November 1940, with the support of the leader of the Volksgruppe in Rum√§nien (ethnic Germans in Romania), Andreas Schmidt, Phleps wrote to the key Waffen-SS recruiting officer SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS (Brigadier) Gottlob Berger offering his services to the Third Reich. He subsequently asked for permission to leave Romania in order to join the Wehrmacht, and this was approved by the recently installed Romanian ConducƒÉtor (leader), the dictator General Ion Antonescu. Phleps volunteered for the Waffen-SS instead, enlisting under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. According to the historian Hans Bergel, Phleps joined the Waffen-SS because Volksdeutsche were not permitted to join the Wehrmacht. He was appointed an SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel) by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and joined the SS Motorised Division Wiking, where he commanded Dutch, Flemish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish volunteers. When Hilmar W√§ckerle, the commander of SS-Regiment Westland, was killed in action near Lvov in late June 1941, Phleps took over command of that regiment. He distinguished himself in fighting at Kremenchuk and Dnipropetrovsk in the Ukraine, commanded his own Kampfgruppe, became a confidant of Generalmajor (Brigadier General) Hans-Valentin Hube, commander of the 16th Panzer Division, and was subsequently promoted to SS-Oberf√ºhrer (senior colonel). In July 1941 he was awarded the 1939 clasp to his Iron Cross (1914) 2nd Class and then the Iron Cross (1939) 1st Class. =7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen= On 30 December 1941, Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Wilhelm Keitel advised Himmler that Adolf Hitler had authorised the raising of a seventh Waffen-SS division from the Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) of Yugoslavia. In the meantime, Phleps reverted to his birth name from his mother's maiden name. Two weeks later, SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS Phleps was selected to organise the new division. On 1 March 1942, the division was officially designated the SS-Freiwilligen-Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\". Phleps was promoted to SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Waffen SS (major general) on 20 April 1942. After recruitment, formation and training in the Banat region in October 1942, the two regiments and supporting arms were deployed into the southwestern part of the German-occupied territory of Serbia as an anti-Partisan force. Headquartered in Kraljevo, with its two mountain infantry regiments centred on U≈æice and Ra≈°ka, the division continued its training. Some artillery batteries, the anti-aircraft battalion, the motorcycle battalion and cavalry squadron continued to form in the Banat. During his time with the 7th SS Division, Phleps was referred to as \\"Papa Phleps\\" by his troops. From left: Italian General Ercole Roncaglia, alt=an Italian officer and three German officers in uniform standing beneath the wing of an aircraft on a grassed airfield In early October 1942, the division commenced Operation Kopaonik, targeting the Chetnik force of Major Dragutin Keseroviƒá in the Kopaonik Mountains. The operation ended with little success, since the Chetniks had forewarning of the operation and were able to avoid contact. After a quiet winter, in January 1943 Phleps deployed the division to the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) to participate in Case White. Between 13 February and 9 March 1943 he was responsible for the initial aspects of raising the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) in the NDH in addition to his duties commanding the 7th SS Division. In his strongly apologetic divisional history of the division which he later commanded, Otto Kumm claims that his division captured Bihaƒá and Bosanski Petrovac, killed over 2,000 Partisans and captured nearly 400 during Case White. After a short rest and refit in April, the division was committed to Case Black in May and June 1943, during which it advanced from the Mostar area into the Italian governorate of Montenegro killing, according to Kumm, 250 Partisans and capturing over 500. The historian Thomas Casagrande notes that all German units fighting partisans routinely counted the civilians they had murdered as partisans. Therefore, it can be assumed that the reported number of inflicted casualties included many civilians. The division played a decisive role during the fighting. Although Himmler had already planned to award Phleps the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his role in organising the 7th SS Division, it was for the achievements of his division during Case Black that Phleps received the award. Phleps was also portrayed in the SS- magazine Das Schwarze Korps. He received the Knight's Cross in July 1943, while being also promoted to Obergruppenf√ºhrer und General der Waffen-SS (lieutenant general), and placed in command of the V SS Mountain Corps. In May 1943, Phleps became frustrated by the failure of his Italian allies to cooperate with German operations, which was demonstrated in his reputation for forthright speech. During a meeting with his Italian counterpart in Podgorica, Montenegro, Phleps called the Italian corps commander General Ercole Roncaglia a \\"lazy macaroni\\". Phleps scolded his Wehrmacht interpreter, Leutnant Kurt Waldheim for toning down his language, saying \\"Listen Waldheim, I know some Italian and you are not translating what I am telling this so-and-so\\". On another occasion, he threatened to shoot Italian sentries who were delaying his passage through a checkpoint. On 15 May 1943, Phleps handed over command of the division to SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS Karl von Oberkamp. While under Phleps' command, the division committed many crimes against civilian population of the NDH, especially during Case White and Case Black. These included \\"burning villages, massacre of inhabitants, torture and murder of captured partisans\\", thence the division thereby developed a distinctive reputation for cruelty. These charges have been denied by Kumm, among others. Still, the divisional orders routinely called for the annihilation of hostile civilian population and documents by the Waffen-SS themselves show that these orders were regularly put into practice. For example, Himmler's police representative in the NDH, SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Polizei Konstantin Kammerhofer, reported on 15 July 1943 that units of the 7th SS Division had shot the Muslim population of Kosutica, about 40 men, women, and children gathered in a \\"church\\". The division claimed that \\"bandits\\" in the village had opened fire, but the police could not discover any traces of combat. Such incidents, which jeopardized the plan to raise a Muslim SS division, led to a dispute between Kammerhofer and Phleps' successor Oberkamp. Himmler ordered Phleps to intervene, and he reported on 7 September 1943 that he could not discover anything wrong with the shootings in Kosutica and that Kammerhofer and Oberkamp had resolved their dispute. The war crimes committed by the 7th SS Division became the subject of international controversy when Waldheim's service in the Balkans became public in the mid-1980s, during his successful bid for the Austrian presidency. =V SS Mountain Corps= The formations under the command of V SS Mountain Corps varied during Phlep's command. In July 1944, it consisted of the 118th J√§ger Division and 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division in addition to the 7th SS and 13th SS divisions. Throughout Phlep's command, the corps was under the overall control of 2nd Panzer Army and conducted anti-Partisan operations throughout the NDH and Montenegro. These operations included Operations Kugelblitz (ball lightning) and Schneesturm (blizzard), which were part of a major offensive in eastern Bosnia in December 1943, but they were only a limited success. Phleps had met personally with Hitler to discuss the planning for Operation Kugelblitz. Due to the unreliable nature of the troops loyal to the NDH government, Phleps utilised Chetnik forces as auxiliaries, stating to a visiting officer that he could not disarm the Chetniks unless the NDH government provided him with the same strength in reliable troops. In January 1944, due to fears that the Western Allies would invade along the Dalmatian coastline and islands, V SS Mountain Corps forced the mass evacuation of male civilians between the ages of 17 and 50 from that area. Phleps was criticised by both NDH and German authorities for the harshness with which the evacuation was carried out. During the first six months of 1944, elements of the V SS Mountain Corps were involved in Operation Waldrausch (Forest Fever) in central Bosnia, Operation Maibaum (Maypole) in eastern Bosnia, and Operation R√∂sselsprung (Knight's Move), the attempt to capture or kill the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito. On 20 June 1944, Phleps was awarded the German Cross in Gold. In September, he was appointed plenipotentiary general of German occupation troops in south Siebenb√ºrgen and the Banat, organising the flight of the Volksdeutsche of north Siebenb√ºrgen ahead of the advancing Soviet Red Army. Death and aftermath Following the 23 August 1944 King Michael's Coup, while en route to a meeting with Himmler in Berlin, Phleps and his entourage made a detour to reconnoitre the situation near Arad, Romania after receiving reports of Soviet advances in that area. Accompanied only by his adjutant and his driver, and unaware of the presence of Red Army units in the vicinity, he entered »òimand, a village approximately north of Arad, on the afternoon of 21 September 1944. Soviet forces were already in the village, and Phleps and his men were captured and brought in for interrogation. When the building in which they were held was attacked by German aircraft later that afternoon, the prisoners tried to escape and were shot by their guards. Bergel suspects that Phleps had been set up by Hungarian army officers who had found out that he knew of plans for Hungary to switch sides as Romania had done shortly before. Phleps' personal effects, including his identity card, tags and decorations, were found by a Hungarian patrol and handed over to German authorities on 29 September 1944. Phleps had been listed as missing in action since 22 September 1944 when he did not show up for his meeting with Himmler, who had issued a warrant for his arrest. Phleps was posthumously awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 24 November 1944, which was presented to his son, SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer (First Lieutenant) Dr.med. Reinhart Phleps, a battalion doctor serving in the 7th SS Division. Soon after his death, the 13th Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment of the 7th SS Division was given the cuff title Artur Phleps in his honour. Phleps was married; his wife's name was Grete and in addition to their son Reinhart, they had a daughter, Irmingard. One of Phleps' brothers became a doctor, and the other was a professor at the Danzig technical university, now Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. Accusations of war crimes Phleps was accused by the Yugoslav authorities of war crimes in association with the atrocities committed by 7th SS Division in the area of Nik≈°iƒá in Montenegro during Case Black. At the Nuremberg trials on 6 August 1946, a document from the Yugoslav State Commission for Crimes of Occupiers and their Collaborators regarding the crimes of the 7th SS Division was quoted as follows: > At the end of May 1943 the division came to Montenegro to the area of Niksic > in order to take part in the fifth enemy offensive in conjunction with the > Italian troops. [...] The officers and men of the SS division Prinz Eugen > committed crimes of an outrageous cruelty on this occasion. The victims were > shot, slaughtered and tortured, or burnt to death in burning houses. [...] > It has been established from the investigations entered upon that 121 > persons, mostly women, and including 30 persons aged 60‚Äì92 years and 29 > children of ages ranging from 6 months to 14 years, were executed on this > occasion in the horrible manner narrated above. The villages [and then > follows the list of the villages] were burnt down and razed to the ground. > [...] For all of these most serious War Crimes those responsible besides the > actual culprits‚Äîthe members of the SS Division Prinz Eugen‚Äîare all superior > and all subordinate commanders as the persons issuing and transmitting the > orders for murder and devastation. Among others the following war criminals > are known: SS Gruppenfuehrer and Lieutenant General of the Waffen-SS Phleps; > Divisional Commander, Major General of the Waffen-SS Karl von Oberkamp; > Commander of the 13th Regiment, later Divisional Commander, Major General > Gerhard Schmidhuber...

Inactivated 1 June 1992. Air Defense Command Alexandria (and later England) AFB was base for Air Defense Command interceptor and radar units along the Gulf Coast. In 1959, the 332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, assigned to the 32d Air Division stationed F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors at the base between 1959-1960. In addition to the fighter-interceptor squadron, England AFB part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. On 1 November 1954 the 653d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations at Alexandria AFB with the activation of AN/MPS-14, AN/TPS-1D, and AN/TPS-10D radars. The site was designated as M-125, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The AN/MPS-14 continued to operate until site closure in 1963. In 1958 the site was operating an AN/FPS-20 search set. In addition to the main facility, Air Defense Command operated three AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Delhi, LA (M-125A): * Weeks Island, LA (M-125C): * Lake Charles GFA, LA (M-125D): England AFB was a planned Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC) location, for the also-planned Shreveport Air-Defense Sector. However, in March 1963 Air Defense Command ordered the site to close due to budget reductions and operations ceased on 23 April. The station was picked up by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after the ADC shut down operations. The site is still in operations using the FPS-20A, being known as Alexandria, Louisiana. Virtually all other parts of this old Air Force radar station have been removed. A golf course now occupies part of the old M-125 site. Closure In October 1990, the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decided that England Air Force Base would be closed by September 1992.

It does this by filling a timeslot on a data transmission line which would otherwise be forced to be idle (empty). In this way, fill characters provide a simple way of timing required idle times. Fill characters are usually used in response to some real-world limitation. For example, mechanical computer printers such as the earliest dot matrix printers may have been able to print 30 characters per second, but when a \\"carriage return\\" character was received and the printhead began returning to the left margin, there was a noticeable delay before the printing of the next line could begin. Unlike modern printers, these early printers contained essentially no buffering, nor did they do any handshaking, so there would be no place to store the characters which would be received while the printhead was in the process of returning to the left margin, nor any way to tell the sender to temporarily stop transmitting characters. Instead, one or more fill characters would be transmitted to cover this time. In its strictest definition, fill characters cause no action to be performed at all; they simply consume time. The ASCII \\"null\\" character is commonly used for this purpose. In actual practice with printers, though, one of the time slots that would otherwise contain a fill character was usually used to contain the \\"line-feed\\" character that caused the paper to advance by one line. For some printers (such as teleprinters), this was all the \\"filling\\" that was needed. As described above, printers commonly required fill characters when the carriage was returned to the left margin. With other equipment, fill characters were occasionally required in other circumstances. For example the VT05 video terminal sometimes required fill characters when a \\"scroll up\\" operation was performed; the process of shuffling data in the shift register memory of the VT05 was slow. In a similar fashion, communications protocols often require fill characters at points when processing must be performed.

He is famous for inventing the offside trap. He was a cousin of Robert McCracken who also had a career as a professional footballer. Career During his career, McCracken captained both Newcastle United and internationally. McCracken played for English club Newcastle United from 1904 to 1924, helping them win three League titles and the FA Cup. McCracken is one of just a few players whose actions have brought changes to the Laws of the Game when, as a centre-half at Newcastle, he masterminded the technique of making opposition forwards ruled \\"offside\\" when the rules stated that three defenders must be between the attacking player and the goal line. So successful was McCracken's defensive ploy that the Offside Rule was changed to \\"two defenders\\" between the foremost attacker and the goal line\\". In total he played 432 games for Newcastle, scoring eight goals. After leaving Newcastle he went on to become Hull City manager in 1923, and he took them to the FA Cup semi-final in 1930. He left the club a year later. He later had a short term in charge of Gateshead, before managing Millwall from 1933 to 1936. He went on to manage the now defunct Aldershot, and later returned to Newcastle as a scout. In the 1970s, with McCracken in his 90s, he was scouting for Watford.

Life Born in Douai, Spanish Netherlands, he was attached at an early age to the English community of St. Bonaventure's convent there, and became a Franciscan Recollect friar, and taught philosophy and divinity. Sent on the English mission, he resided for many years in Oxfordshire, and in 1695 he was tutor in the family of Henry Fermor of Tusmore. His advocacy of Cartesianism met with strong resistance from Samuel Parker, who would become bishop of Oxford.s.v. 'Le Grand, Antoine' in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Towards the close of his life he engaged in sharp controversies on metaphysical topics with John Sergeant, a secular priest. At the twenty-third chapter of his order, assembled in London on 9 July 1693, he was elected provincial, and he held that office till his death on 9 August 1699. He lived a studious and retired life.

The game had a home system launch price of approximately US$200. While not released outside of Japan, a complete English translation can be seen when played on non-Japanese systems, which retitles the game's name.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The player stars as Joe Yabuki, an aspiring boxer, as he goes from an unknown kid from the rough side of town to a boxing champion. The game follows the traditional beat 'em up format, with some portions taking place inside a boxing ring and others taking place in the back alleyways, as Joe trains, fights bullies, and then fights in the boxing ring.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Legend of Success Joe on their August 15, 1991 issue as being the tenth most- successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Hat Trick Hero. Despite the notability of the source material, the game was reviewed very poorly and did not receive a release outside Japan. It is widely considered one of the worst games for the Neo Geo system, with common complaints being very poor gameplay control, inadequate graphics and poor animation on a system that was touted as not having these issues.Kazuya_UK, Review of Legend of Success Joe , neogeoforlife.com, Accessed Jun. 02, 2007Bobak Ha'Eri, Review of Legend of Success Joe, Neo-Geo.com, Accessed Apr. 23, 2006Cyril Lachel, Review of Legend of Success Joe , DefunctGames.com, Accessed Apr. 23, 2006OverClocked: Mystery Videogame Theater 3000 presents: Episode #11 - Legend of Success Joe, OverClocked.org, Feb. 28, 2000, Accessed Jun. 24, 2006RalfLoire, Review of Legend of Success Joe, GameFAQs, Accessed Apr. 23, 2006BMan2, Review of Legend of Success Joe, JoseQ Emu Views, Accessed Apr. 23, 20065 worst games you ever played?, Neo-Geo.com, Aug. 23, 2000, Accessed Apr. 23, 2006Worst Neo Geo Game of All Time , SNK-Capcom.com, Sept. 27, 2003, Accessed Apr. 23, 2006  Notes   References   External links  * Legend of Success Joe at GameFAQs * Legend of Success Joe at Giant Bomb * Legend of Success Joe at Killer List of Videogames * Legend of Success Joe at MobyGames Category:1991 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Beat 'em ups Category:Boxing video games Category:Fighting games Category:Japan- exclusive video games Category:Neo Geo games Category:Single-player video games Category:SNK games Category:Video games based on anime and manga Category:Video games developed in Japan ja:„ÅÇ„Åó„Åü„ÅÆ„Ç∏„Éß„Éº ","title":"Legend of Success Joe"},{"id":"4880109","text":"Yetta Barsh Shachtman (1915‚Äì1996) was an American socialist politician, married to Max Shachtman, a Marxist theorist.

The wooded hill-top, a distinctive feature of the estate, is now a landmark that sits at the centre of modern North Bourtreehill in the district of North Ayrshire on the west coast of Scotland. Only Surviving Arch of Bourtreehill Physical characteristics Only a mile from the town of Irvine, the remaining land surrounding Bourtreehill House is an overgrown woodland at the summit of a wide but relatively low hill. Medieval in origin and with an array of ruined structures, ancient trees, and overgrown avenues, the estate, which once housed associates of Robert Burns, William Wallace and Lord Byron, has a hidden and mysterious history. That it was once tended by a competent gardener is clear; well defined, though overgrown, garden features are still perfectly visible, many of which date back to the mid-18th century. Greatest ruin ten years before collapse Three antiquated, but currently unidentified, ruined buildings stand deep within the woods of the original estate. In the early 1980s, two arches stood side by side in the northeastern quarter. These are known to have served some purpose involving the coming and going of traffic. The oldest entrance (and subsequently the oldest driveway) once led the visitor directly to the twin arches. Sadly, only one of these fine structures still remains, while the other has been progressively vandalised over the last two decades. The boundaries of the original medieval estate can still be traced quite easily. During the construction of the modern North Bourtreehill housing scheme, the original confines of the estate were only slightly adjusted. Many houses lie within the ancient interior of Bourtreehill, but those dwellings have been designed in such a way that they complement the undulating land and wooded features. The housing schemes in North Bourtreehill have been described as biomorphic in their style. The River Annick Runs through the area and so adds to the natural surroundings which dominate the North Bourtreehill complex. Rare wooden sleeper from BourtreehillThe land surrounding the estate was peppered by railway lines. An early 19th century railway trackbed can still be followed to the south of Bourtreehill, and a few notably old railway sleepers can be discovered by the highly alert visitor.

In 1556, Montgomery family papers reference \\"John Lyn of that Ilk and Lord of Bourtreehill.\\" The Hunter family papers published by the Scottish Record Society include several 16th-17th century references to Bourtreehill in connection with the Lynns, describing the Lynns as \\"of that Ilk.\\" Finally, mention of the Lynns in Bourtreehill can be found in a 1608 testament. A partial record of the Lynns of Bourtreehill is as follows: Bourtreehill on a misty Morning 13 Jan 1505 - Andrew Lyne received a charter from Robert Frances, Lord of Stane, for land in Bourtreehill, for which he was to pay to Frances the third part of a whole peppercorn on the feast of St. Martin in winter on the ground of the said lands in name of blench ferm if asked; and to the lords portioners of Peristoun seventeen bolls in measure of oats used and accustomed at two yearly ters St. Martin in winter and Whitsunday by equal portions upon the ground of the said lands. The land consisted of two merks with a half merk of the lands of old extent called Bourtreehill together with two parts of the common, including the three fields lying between the lands called Blakatbank and with a half part of the march lying between the lands of Stayne and the lands called Scottanrig lying in the lordship of Stayne, bailliary of Cunningham and shire of Ayr. The charter was executed in Irvine and is preserved in the papers of the Montgomery family, Earls of Eglinton. 7 Nov 1522 - Robert Hunter resigned lands of Highlees [Dundonald] to John Lyn of Boutrehill. 2 May 1528 - John Lyn of Bowrtrehill witnessed an instrument in Glasgow concerning the Montgomerys. Carpets of Bluebells indicate antiquity 21 Jan 1548 - John Lyn of that Ilk and Bowtrehill conveyed the lands of Highlees to Archibald Crawford as guardian for the heir of Hunterston. 5 Mar 1556 - John Lyn of that Ilk and Lord of Bourtreehill gave sasine in favor of his brother Laurence Lyn, Laurence's spouse Bessie Wallace, and their heirs. 8 Feb 1568 - Laurence Lin of Bourtrehill witnessed an instrument executed by John Lin of that Ilk, superior of Highlees. 8 Oct 1592 - The late Laurence Lin of Bourtrehill was mentioned in an agreement between his widow, Elizabeth Wallace, and William Lin of Bourtreehill, her son, in which William discharged all sums due under certain marriage contracts. On 17 October 1608, a testament was recorded for Bessie Wallace, deceased spouse of Laurence Lyne in Bourtriehill, Ayrshire. This is the last known reference to Lynns in Bourtreehill. In fact, Bourtreehill had been conveyed two years earlier to the Skelmorlies. =17th & 18th centuries= On 18 February 1606, the two merk land and a half of Bourtreehill was conveyed to Robert Montgomery of Skelmorlie, as evidenced by a contract held by the National Archives of Scotland. The house was built in 1682.Davis, Page 186 In 1685, and 1696 the barony belonged to the Skelmorlie family, from whom it was purchased by Peter Montgomerie, merchant in Glasgow whose son, James Montgomerie, sold it to Robert Hamilton, prior to 1748. Robert Hamilton was born 5 January 1698 and was the eldest son of Hugh Hamilton of Clongall, merchant in Ayr. He and his younger brother, John, ancestor of the Hamiltons of Sundrum, were long resident in Jamaica, where they possessed the estate of Pemberton valley, and acquired very considerable wealth. Robert died 4 June 1773, aged 75. Kilbirnie Place was destroyed by fire early in the morning of 1 May 1757 during building works and never rebuilt. The 19th Earl of Crawfurd, his infant daughter Jean (later a Countess of Eglinton), and domestics had little time to escape.Paterson,Page 286-287 The family moved to Bourtreehill House near Irvine. Lady Crawfurd was the eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill.Dobie, Page 233 In 1776 the Countess of Crawfurd is given as proprietor on plate 45 of G. Taylor and A. Skinner's 'Survey and maps of the roads of North Britain or Scotland'. =19th century= Bourtreehill Bluebells Robert Hamilton of Rozelle was succeeded by his eldest daughter, the Countess Craufurd, who died 6 October 1809. Her sister, Dame Margaret Hamilton Cathcart, widow of Sir John Cathcart of Carelton, who died in 1785 then succeeded. She died in 1817 and the property devolved upon her nephew, the Earl of Eglinton. In 1840 the house was altered for Hugh Montgomerie and at this time probably gained a bay window and entrance porch.Davis, Page 186 Alexander Guthrie of Mount in Kilmarnock purchased Bourtreehill in 1847 and it passed to his daughter, Christina in 1852 (Dobie 1876). Christina married the Hon. D.A.F.Browne, who became Lord Oranmore and Browne in the Peerage of Ireland. Nothing now remains of Bourtreehill House, however remains of outbuildings are still visible. In 1879 Bourtreehill was badly damaged by fire and was restored to the designs of R.S.Ingram.Davis, Page 186 =20th century= During the Enlightenment, Bourtreehill housed some of the most important people in the region. The Baron Oranmore and Browne of Bourtreehill House was the grandfather of Tara Browne. In the 18th century, the Earl of Crawford, whose house in Kilbirnie burned to the ground, rescued his wife and daughter and took residence in Bourtreehill House which dated to the early 17th century. It became one of the many great houses lost in the 20th century when it was demolished in the 1960s. Modern housing estate of Bourtreehill It is an unfortunate truth that Bourtreehill House, with its preserved Medieval surroundings, is still subject to a certain amount of confusion. Unknown to many Bourtreehillians, the estate is much older than the Bourtreehill which is known today. The date of the inception of Bourtreehill is, as yet, unknown but in the centuries that passed its history has been peppered with a multitude of wealthy, powerful and influential people. Giant Sequoia in BourtreehillPoliticians, literary fellows and kings are known to have possessed, rented or visited the estate. That several of those influential historical characters were women is also a valuable and notable point when considering the history of Bourtreehill in the middle-ages and later 17th-18th centuries. The building became derelict and was demolished in the 1970s, leaving only fragmentary remains of the coach-house and outbuildings.Davis, Page 186  Mr. Hamilton of Bourtreehill's gardener  Gravestone of Andrew UrquhartThe owner of Bourtreehill in 1754 was one Robert Hamilton. His two daughters married the Earls of Crawford and Eglinton, the latter family later inheriting the entire estate. The Earl of Crawford, who lived in Kilbirnie took his new wife there to live but a devastating fire - from which the Earl rescued his family - brought the house to the ground. The Kilbirnie Earl of Crawford sought shelter and his father-in-law, Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, gave his estate to the distressed family. Hamilton moved to another estate he had purchased close by and the Crawford family moved into Bourtreehill House in 1757. The footman employed by the Earl of Crawford had come to Bourtreehill to continue to duties. He later published his works under the name Memoirs of an 18th Century Footman. At the same time, the gardener employed by Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, was directly responsible for much of the landscaping and decoration in the present remnant that survives today. He was a subject in the Letters of Gilbert Burns, a collection of letters written by the brother of Robert Burns. In these, Gilbert reminisces on a book loan between his own father, William Burness and \\"Mr. Hamilton of Bourtreehill's gardener\\". The grave of Andrew Urquhart can be seen in Irvine Parish Graveyard.

Born in Preston, Kelly represented the Republic of Ireland internationally, winning 34 caps for his country. Both his father, Alan Kelly, Sr., who also represented Ireland, and older brother, Gary Kelly, played as goalkeepers. Club career Kelly started his career at Preston North End in the Fourth Division, following the footsteps of his father, Alan Kelly, Sr., and played 142 League games for the team. He joined Sheffield United in July 1992 for ¬£150,000. Kelly stayed with Sheffield United until 1999, despite their relegation from the Premiership shortly into his career with them. In total, he made 213 appearances for the Blades. He helped Sheffield United to the 1997-98 FA Cup semi finals at Old Trafford where they were defeated by Newcastle United. In the quarter final replay against Coventry City, the game went to a penalty shootout and Kelly saved from Dion Dublin, Simon Haworth and David Burrows to help his side progress. In 1999, Kelly transferred to Blackburn Rovers, making 39 appearances, and stayed there until his retirement from football in 2004. This time also included loan spells at Stockport County and Birmingham City. He made more than 470 appearances in all competitions at club level. International career He won 34 caps for the Republic of Ireland, and was a member of the Republic's 1994 and 2002 World Cup squads. He was the team's second-choice goalkeeper on both occasions (behind Packie Bonner and Shay Given respectively), and never played in a World Cup game. Later career In the summer of 2006, Kelly was goalkeeping coach for the Soccer-Academy camps, located in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania in the United States. He is currently the goalkeeping coach of the Republic of Ireland national football team and at Preston North End's Centre of Excellence. After spending 18 months at Preston North End's Centre of Excellence Kelly became the new goalkeeping coach following the dismissal of Phil Brown and appointment of David Unsworth as caretaker manager.

It consists of the northern part of the Ch≈´goku region, facing the Sea of Japan.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"San'in\\" in ; Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Etymology The name San'in in the Japanese language is formed from two kanji characters. The first, , \\"mountain\\", and the second, represents the \\"yin\\" of yin and yang. The name means the northern, shady side of the mountains in contrast to the yang \\"southern, sunny\\" San'y≈ç region to the south. History =Early history= The San'in region has numerous Paleolithic and J≈çmon period (14,000 - 300 BC) remains, but its Yayoi period (300 BC - 250 AD) remains are the largest in Japan. The Mukibanda Yayoi remains in the low foothills of Mount Daisen in the cities of Daisen and Yonago, Tottori Prefecture are the largest in Japan.Muki-Banda Remains The site is still only partially excavated, but indicates that the San'in was a regional center of power in the period. The mythology of the Shinto religion is largely based in the Izumo area of the region, and the Izumo-taisha, or Izumo Grand Shrine in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, is one of the most ancient and important Shinto shrines in Japan. The eastern part of Shimane Prefecture also had cultural and economic connections to the Asian mainland from an early period. =San'ind≈ç= The San'in region corresponds to , one of the gokishichid≈ç, or five provinces and seven circuits established in the Asuka period (538‚Äì710) under the Ritsury≈ç legal system. San'ind≈ç refers not only to the ancient geographic region, but also the main road through the region that connected it to the capitol in Kyoto.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). The San'in encompassed the pre-Meiji provincial areas of Tanba, Tango, Tajima, Inaba, H≈çki, Izumo, Iwami and Oki.Titsingh, =San'ind≈ç route= While the San'ind≈ç route was used for military logistics in numerous conflicts after the Asuka period, it more importantly served as a route for the transport of good to and from the region. The route reached its highest period of importance in the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867) when the Tokugawa shogunate formalized its route and shukuba post stations. The daimy≈ç regional rulers used the San'ind≈ç for their sankin-k≈çtai mandatory journeys to Edo (modern Tokyo). =Modern usage= The San'in region now has no administrative authority. In modern Japanese usage it generally refers to the prefectures of Shimane, Tottori and northern area of Yamaguchi. The northern areas of Hy≈çgo and Ky≈çto prefectures are sometimes included in the region as well. Japan Route 9, the San'in Expressway, and the JR West San'in Main Line follow the historical route of the San'ind≈ç, and remnants of the shukuba, some well preserved, remain throughout the region. Geography The San'in Region has a long coastline along the Japan Sea that dramatically sweeps south to the Ch≈´goku Mountains along the length of the region. The area is primarily mountainous with few plains. While the climate of the San'in region is not as harsh as that of the Hokuriku region to the north, winters are characterized by heavy snow and rainfall typical of areas on the Japan Sea. Economy The San'in region is far from the industrial and cultural heartlands of Japan, and the region is consequently economically undeveloped compared to the other regions of Japan. The landscape remains rural and unindustrialized, and the urban areas of the region are decentralized. Tottori and Shimane are the least populated prefectures in Japan, and the population is aging at a rate faster than the rest of Japan. Cities in the region with a population of over 100,000 remain only the prefectural capitols of Tottori and Matsue, the more recently industrialized Yonago, and Izumo, a city formed from numerous smaller cities and villages after World War II. The agricultural output of the San'in region, however, remains very high. Its broad coastal and mountainous areas are protected as national, prefectural, and municipal parks, and these areas are now popular tourist destinations. Transportation The San'in region is connected by several JR West rail lines and some highways, but transportation is relatively undeveloped compared to other regions of Japan. Projects to connect the region to the wider highway network of Japan continue.

Biography  Mathilde Marie Constance M√©n√©trier was born in 1846. In 1869, she married Anatole-Th√©odore-Marie Huot, the editor of the leftist Parisian review, L'Encyclop√©die Contemporaine Illustr√©e. She was a close friend of the Swedish anarchist, impressionist painter Ivan Agu√©li, whom she indirectly introduced to Sufism and dedicated her collection of symbolism poems Le Missel de Notre-Dame des Solitudes (\\"The Missal of Our Lady of Solitudes\\"). Huot was an advocate for animal rights and member of the Parisian animal protection society, founder of the Popular League against Vivisection and France's first hospice for animals. She was famous for a number of spectacular activist actions. In 1886, she interrupted a lecture by Louis Pasteur at the Sorbonne University, for using dogs in animal testing. Once, at Coll√®ge de France, she hit the Mauritian scientist Charles-√âdouard Brown- S√©quard over the head with a parasol for having performed a vivisection on a monkey. In 1900, she helped Ivan Agu√©li in his attack on two matadors at a French bullfight. Active in the French Neo-Malthusianism movement, Huot was the originator of the expression \\"la gr√©ve des ventres\\" (\\"strike of the bellies\\" or \\"birth strike\\"). In 1892, Huot delivered a public conference, in which she demanded free access to abortion and contraception. At this conference, Huot also advocated for the voluntary extinction of the human race by refusal to procreate, both out of compassion for human suffering and the suffering that humans inflict on animals.

Alternatives works to promote justice and equality amongst individuals and communities worldwide. Active in over 35 countries, Alternatives supports local, community-based initiatives working towards the greater economic, social, and political rights of people and communities affected by poverty, discrimination, exploitation, and violence. The organization publishes the Le Journal des Alternatives newsletter, a publication inserted every three months in Montreal's French paper Le Voir. Alternatives also publishes the Alternatives International Journal, a monthly publication in English distributed electronically. Alternatives Montreal is the headquarters of an International Federation consisting of nine NGOs spread across the world. Alternative-Niger, Alternatives Asia (New Delhi), Alternative Information Center (Jerusalem), Forum Macrocain des Alternatives Sud, Initiative Pour un Autre Monde, Institut Alternatives Terrazul, Khanya College, and Teacher Creativity Center. Vision Alternatives knows that, through the development of sustainable societies, another world is possible. This belief is grounded in the engagement, experience, and values of Alternatives' members and the social movements to which they belong. ‚Ä¢ In this world, women, men and children will live in dignity and respect, and will equitably share the power and resources they need to live and thrive. ‚Ä¢ In this world, the diversity of peoples and persons will be respected, as will the human, civil, economic, social, and cultural rights of all of its inhabitants. ‚Ä¢ In this world, solidarity, cooperation, respect for the environment, participatory democracy, and peace will be the pillars that hold it aloft. ‚Ä¢ In this world, founded upon sustainable, just, and democratic social and economic development, construction has already begun at a local, national, and global level. Mission statement Alternatives' mission statement (2009) reads: \\"Strengthened by our vision and national and international experience, Alternatives is an organization that works for solidarity, justice, and equity the world over. Alternatives' aim is to help the networking, building, and promoting of innovative initiatives in popular and social movements that are fighting for economic, social, political, cultural and environmental rights.\\" The organization says that it wants to \\"strengthen citizen action and reinforce the contribution of social movements in the construction of sustainable societies.\\" International program Alternatives is present in Latin America, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, as well as Central, South and Southeast Asia. Alternatives Montreal is the headquarters of a federation consisting of nine NGOs spread across the world. Alternative-Niger, Alternatives Asia (New Delhi), Alternative Information Center (Jerusalem), Forum Macrocain des Alternatives Sud, Initiative Pour un Autre Monde, Institut Alternatives Terrazul, Khanya College, and Teacher Creativity Center. In each of these regions, the organisation works in direct partnership with groups of women and men who are struggling for progress, respect and justice; as well as the peace and sustainable development of their community, their environment, and their region. Alternatives supports network creation between groups so that they can benefit from their shared experiences and successes. Network formation is crucial since it allows for a deepened analysis and comprehension of the conflicts affecting their communities from the outside. Alternatives' and its partners' international solidarity projects are centered upon: * The environment and sustainable development * Democracy * Rehabilitation of communities affected by war * Good governance * Socio-economic justice and equality * Civil, political, economic, social and human rights * The fight against poverty * Women's rights, equality between genders, the inclusion of women in all spheres of society * Education and inclusion of youth * Civil society development, management, and autonomy * Freedom of organization, of information, of the press, and of religion  Criticism  Alternatives has been criticised as a political organisation supporting \\"left-leaning causes\\" through taxpayer funds, provided by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The Conservative government noted that the Alternatives' board includes \\"supporters of Hezbollah and Hamas, such as Ali Mallah, vice- president of the Canadian Arab Federation.\\" In addition, the government was reported to have been concerned regarding a 2008 \\"education camp\\" at Saint- Alphonse de Rodriguez in Quebec, was attended by \\"500 motivated militants\\" from Lebanon, Iraq, and Venezuela. Youth Internship Programs Alternatives organizes overseas youth internship programs (such as Alternatives' NetCorps program), with the aim of developing a sense of solidarity and curiosity about other regions within youth. These internships emphasize understanding Third World realities and encouraging actions that will advance Alternatives' message of justice. Thanks to the internships, hundreds of young people have had the opportunity to participate in uncommon professional, cultural, and human experiences. Alternatives' Internships Program for 2009-2010 offers internships funded by the Qu√©bec Sans Fronti√®res Program of Qu√©bec's Minist√®re des relations internationales.

The Alternatives newspaper, a monthly compendium of international, national, and cultural news, has a distribution of 50,000, creating a window of alternative information on the world. Whether in Quebec, Canada, or the world, Alternatives works to raise public awareness of international and local policy debates and keep people informed of the links between them. Through its information and educational campaigns, reflecting our concerns with equality and justice for the South, Alternatives goes beyond the general public to reach policymakers. At the local level, our work involves environmental concerns, participatory democracy, out-reach and solidarity programs with immigrant communities and the promotion of pro-social policies. For the last 16 years, Alternatives has been hosting the Journ√©es Alternatives, a three-day retreat with Alternatives volunteers at Camp Papillon de St-Alphonse de Rodriguez. The retreat promotes reflection, engagement and education and has hundreds of participants yearly. Alternatives' Rooftop Gardens Project in Montreal Since 2003, Alternatives has funded and promoted promotes a Rooftop Garden Project, which has been exploring new ways to interact with urban man-made environment and the food cycle, for a greener city and healthier communities. The Rooftop Garden Project is a combination of hydroponic cultivation, permaculture, organic agriculture and collective gardening. It has inspired numerous initiatives in Qu√©bec, Canada and elsewhere in the world. The new green community spaces have been designed as collective gardens, making participation possible in both public and private areas. This is founded in a desire to offer some simple food production models that are affordable, environmentally friendly and easy to adapt for use in both the South and the North, in a response to growing urbanization, pollution and growing urban poverty. In 2008, the Rooftop Garden Project earned the highest environmental distinction in Quebec, the Ph√©nix de l‚Äôenvironnement, and received the 2008 National Urban Design Award from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP) and the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects (CSLA) for its collaborative project with McGill University's Minimum Cost Housing Groupe and Santropol Roulant.

It entered the state south of Baxter Springs and continued north until it crossed the Brush Creek, from where it turned east and left the state in Galena. After the decertification of the highway in 1985, this road segment was numbered as US-69 (alternate) from Quapaw, Oklahoma north to Riverton, Kansas and as K-66 (Kansas highway) from Riverton east to Route 66 in Missouri. History Riverton The of US-66 in Kansas retains much of the character of the Mother Road. It passes through Baxter Springs, Riverton and Galena in Cherokee County. In 1929 the US-66 in Kansas was paved, Kansas being the first state to do that. In Galena, US-66 originally turned north on Main Street, then east on Front Street before leaving the state as Route 66 to Central City, Missouri. This portion was changed in 1979 to remain on 7th Avenue, seven blocks south of the original routing, eastward to the Missouri state line. When US-66 was bypassed by Interstate 44 (I-44) in 1961, the new Interstate highway crossed directly from Oklahoma to Missouri, bypassing Kansas entirely by just a quarter mile (400 m). US-69 Alternate was formed in 1985 when US-66 was decommissioned; the remainder of US-66 in Kansas became K-66. The final (1985) alignment of US-66 therefore perfectly matches present US-69 Alternate and K-66. Route description Soda fountain on Main Street in Baxter Springs named for Route 66. Coming from the west, US 66 entered Kansas from Oklahoma, concurrent with US-69 Alternate, also called Military Avenue. From the state line, the highway ran north through Baxter Springs. At the intersection of US-66 with West 30th Street, the highway originally traveled east onto West 30th Street and then north onto Roberts Road to get back to Military Avenue. In 1933 this changed and US-66 ran over the curve on the inside of the intersection of West 30th Street with Roberts Road. In the 1960s this changed again and the road would simply continue on Military Avenue. In the northern part of Baxter Springs, US-66 originally turned West at the intersection of Military Avenue with 3rd Street. It followed this road as it curved to the north and became Willow Avenue, and later changed name again to 50th Street. Continuing north the route crossed over Brush Creek, just right from the Marsh arch Rainbow Bridge, which was originally used to cross it. The route continued northeast and as it became Beasley Road it turned east to get back to US-69 Alternate, also known as US-400 here, at the intersection with K-66. In the 1960s, the route changed and ran straight from Baxter Spring over US-69 Alternate to this intersection. Both alignments continued east onto K-66 passing through Riverton and crossing over the Spring River to get to Galena near the state line with Missouri. US-66 enters Galena in the east over K-66. The first alignment, which was used from the commissioning in 1926 until the 1940s, followed Main Street to the north at the intersection of K-66 with Main Street, known as K-26 to the south. It would then turn east onto Front Street, crossing a viaduct over railroad tracks and entering Missouri shortly after. This alignment changed in the 1940s, as US-66 ran straight across Main Street and continue east on K-66 and enter Missouri a little bit more to the south. Major intersections Structures Brush Creek rainbow bridge A restored Kan-O-Tex Service Station on Main Street in Galena was re-opened in 2007 as a roadside diner and souvenir shop called 'Four Women on the Route', and then under newer ownership, was renamed to 'Cars on the Route'. It sits in front of the former location of the Banks Hotel which was demolished in 1950s. Sitting to the north of the station is the historic 'bordello' which currently is an antique store. It was first designated to be a bed and breakfast before becoming an antique shop. Located west across the street from the station is the Smith & Moeller Building (built in 1896) as a lumber and building supply house. In 1932, it became the Front Street Garage selling tires and Phillips 66 gas, later selling White Rose gasoline. Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Kansas include the Baxter Springs Independent Oil and Gas Service Station (now a tourist information site for US-66 in Kansas), the Brush Creek Bridge, and the Williams' Store in Riverton. A section of the road between the Missouri state line and Galena is listed on the National Register as the Kansas Route 66 Historic District‚ÄîEast Galena. In addition to the roadway, the district includes seven box culverts, a triple box culvert, and the Galena Viaduct. Although the roadway and all the structures were built during 1922-23, about three years before Route 66 was designated as a federal highway, it was deemed that \\"as a group these elements, together with their setting, form a cultural landscape that clearly conveys the historic feeling of Route 66.\\" While buildings and structures on this section of US-66 in its 1950s heyday included five major trucking companies, a series of motels and tourist courts (Sunbeam Tourist Camp, Camp Joy, Baxter Court Cabins, Satterlee‚Äôs Tourist Cabins, Capistrano Motel) alongside restaurants, roadhouses, filling stations, souvenir stands and commercial stores, by 2002 almost all of the tourist lodging had been demolished. Only a portion of the former Satterlee's remains; it had been converted to storage space. Food service establishments fared somewhat better by relying on a strong local clientele after I-44 bypassed the state in 1961, but ultimately lead and zinc mine closures in the Tri-State district plus the diversion of US-66 traffic by I-44 led to the closure of many local Cherokee County businesses.

History An ancient Finno-Ugric Meri trading settlement and a wooden hill fortress once existed on the site of modern Manturovo, at the confluence of the Unzha and Mezha Rivers. The name means Mantu = Podzol, Rova = higher place in sparsely coniferous forest. According to its name it have had a Saame or Nenents roots. Finno-Ugrian Rova derives from Saame (Sami) word Roavve which means hill or open place as result of forest fire. Thus the place was inhabited at least c. 2000 BCE. It became a Meri settlement by c. 300 CE and remained such until at least the 14th century. The Russian village of Manturovo was first mentioned in 1617. Later on, it grew into a town and was granted town status in 1958.

It was founded as a third distinct society within the Congregation of Holy Cross, that is, the congregation of the priests and brothers of Holy Cross. The Marianites of Holy Cross is now an independent congregation. History =Founders= Basil Moreau In 1835 Father Basil Anthony Moreau, then assistant superior of the seminary at Le Mans, founded a group of priests to assist him in his endeavors to re-invigorate the Church throughout the diocese. He called them the Society of Auxiliary Priests. He also assumed supervision of the Brothers of St. Joseph when their founder Father Jacques Dujari√© became too ill to continue their direction. In 1837 the two organizations were combined to form the Association of the Holy Cross.\\"History of Father Moreau\\", Marianites of the Holy Cross The following year he gave a rule of life to a group of devout laywomen who assisted the priests and brothers, first by doing domestic work, then in teaching and nursing. These women became the Marianites of Holy Cross. In 1841 the first Marianites received the religious habit. The Marianites were dedicated to Mary, under the title of Our Lady of Seven Dolors. The women of Holy Cross came to form three distinct congregations: Marianites of Holy Cross, Sisters of the Holy Cross, and Sisters of Holy Cross. L√©ocadie Romaine Gascoin L√©ocadie Romaine Gascoin was born 1818 in Montenay, the 4th of 6 children. Her parents were middle-class farmers. Her mother died in 1822. L√©ocadie spent most of her early life at home taking care of her family. 1841 she became one of the first Marianites, entered the novitiate in Le Mans. She received her religious formation with the Sisters of the Good Shepherd at their monastery in Le Mans. Gascoin pronounced first vows in 1844 and the following year she was named the first Superior General of the Marianites, taking the name Mother Mary of Seven Dolors (M√®re Marie des Sept Douleurs). She died in 1900 in Le Mans.St. Matthew, Sister Mary of. \\"Sisters Marianites of Holy Cross.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 23 March 2016 Expansion As the congregation grew throughout the 1840s and early 1850s in the United States and Canada, Fr. Moreau would always send groups of priests, brothers and sisters to work together and support each other's mission within the Family of Holy Cross. The sisters initially supported the priests and brothers by providing domestic services. At the request of C√©lestine Guynemer de la Hailandi√®re, Bishop of Vincennes, Moreau sent some sisters who established in 1844, in Bertrand, Michigan, a school for girls. By 1855, this school would move the 6 miles to Notre Dame, Indiana to become Saint Mary's College, one of the leading Catholic women's liberal arts colleges, even today. In 1846 Bishop Ignace Bourget of Montreal asked Moreau, whom he had visited at Holy Cross, to send him sisters whom he might establish in his diocese. Four religious were sent in 1847 and founded their first house in the village of St. Lawrence, near Montreal. In 1856, Rome approved the constitutions of Holy Cross for the men. Doubting the propriety of a mixed congregation of men and women, Rome separated the women into an independent community at that time. Fr. Moreau, in his role as their founder, continued to work for Rome's approval of the sisters' constitution. In 1885, Rome approved the constitutions of the Marianites of Holy Cross, granting them the status of \\"congregation\\" within the Church. Meanwhile, the sisters' works continued to grow and multiply, particularly in schools in New Orleans, Louisiana, Le Mans, France and Quebec, Canada. The unity of the Marianites of Holy Cross would not last long. Competing authorities at Notre Dame and Le Mans, complicated by slow communications over large distances, led to the withdrawal of the sisters at Indiana in 1867 and Quebec in 1883. They formed two new, independent congregations: the Sisters of the Holy Cross at Notre Dame, Indiana and the Sisters of Holy Cross at Montreal, Quebec. =Louisiana= In 1849 three Marianite sisters traveled from France to New Orleans and opened an orphanage for boys. That followed in 1866 with Holy Angels Academy, a high school for girls, located in the Bywater historic district. With the opening of the Archdiocesan Archbishop Hannan High School in Meraux, enrollment was reduced and Holy Angels closed in 1992.Bridges, Tyler. \\"Holy Angels campus in Bywater up for sale after being home to Marianites for 165 years\\", New Orleans Advocate, November 15, 2014 In 1965 the Marianites of Holy Cross founded Our Lady of Prompt Succor Nursing Home to meet the needs in the surrounding communities for long term health care and short term rehabilitation services.

This station bore a strong resemblance to the Grand Hotel Station and the Pine Hill Station, which both looked like longer versions of the Mount Pleasant Station. Ulster and Delaware This station was built when the Rondout and Oswego Railroad got to Arkville (then called Dean's Corners) in 1871, covering the site of the ancient Tuscarora Indian headquarters. In addition to the station the U&D; also constructed a freight house, engine house, water tower, coaling tower and turntable here. Helper engines were added to eastbound trains here to help with steep grade to the summit at Grand Hotel Station. Major shippers here included the Luzerene Chemical Company and Callanan Industries. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Luzerne operated large wood acid factory located on the flats west of the U&D; and north of the D&N.; This factory was served by a long siding running south from the U&D.; Calanan received large quantities of material used in highway construction up through the 1970s, processing them in a plant located on the flat south of the present Arkville yard. In the town of Arkville, there were several churches, stores, hotels, and even a local waterworks. This station survived until the end of passenger service on the U&D; in 1954, when the station was abandoned and left to deteriorate. It was hit by a runaway milk truck in the 1960s, and was so badly destroyed, that it was torn down for fear someone would get hurt. Now the freight half of the Halcottville Railroad Station and a group of benches are in its place. The U&D;'s Arkville freight house is now the Arkville Station for the Delaware and Ulster Railroad. Delaware and Northern Arkville was the eastern terminus of the Delaware and Northern. The D&N; track ended at the switch just east of the Route 28 highway crossing, but its trains were allowed to enter the yard and use the turntable. West of New York State Route 28 the D&N; had their own freight house which still stands today as a laundromat, a pizza parlor, and an apartment complex. The D&N; ran this freight house and made business at the Arkville station until it went bankrupt in 1942. Its equipment was sold for scrap, and the railroad was torn up, making way for the new Pepacton Reservoir, which submerged over ‚Öî of its right-of-way. The New York Central acquired the portion of the D&N; running past the D&N;'s old freight house and served a retail coal dealer located there up through the 1970s.

Like the Rothschilds, they were Jews, but the Pereire brothers were Sephardi Jews of Portuguese origin. Origins Jacob Rodrigues Pereira, one of the inventors of manual language for the deaf, was their grandfather. He was born in Peniche, Portugal and established himself in France in 1741, where he became an interpreter for King Louis XV. Both brothers were followers of Saint- Simonism until their break with Enfantin in the early 1830s. Business √âmile (3 December 1800 ‚Äì 5 January 1875) and his brother Isaac (25 November 1806 ‚Äì 12 July 1880) founded a business conglomerate that included creating the Cr√©dit Mobilier bank. It became a powerful and dynamic funding agency for major projects in France, Europe and the world at large. It specialized in mining developments; it funded other banks including the Imperial Ottoman Bank or the Austrian Mortgage Bank; it funded railway construction and insurance companies, as well as building contractors. Their bank had large investments in a transatlantic steamship lines, urban gas lighting, a newspaper and the Paris public transit system. In 1866/7, the bank underwent a severe crisis, and the Pereires were forced to resign at the demand of the Banque de France; the bank never recovered. Eug√®ne Pereire Eug√®ne Pereire by Charles Louis Gratia (1884) Eug√®ne Pereire (1831‚Äì1908), son of Isaac, joined the enterprise and took over the running of the business empire on his father's death in 1880.

Beginnings  The work of the Church of God was started in India by the American missionary Robert F. Cook. Cook worked in India during the 1920s through the 1940s. After some attempts to begin a Pentecostal work in northern parts of India, Cook realized that there were ancient Christian communities in southern India, especially in Kerala. After arriving in Kerala, he fell in love with the land and the people. He crossed paths with a man named Kalloor Chacko, of Thrikkannamangal, Kottarakara. While a prominent figure in the Brethren Church in India, Chacko accepted the teachings of Cook regarding the work of the Holy Spirit. The two joined hands to establish the first registered Pentecostal church in India. It was named the Church of God. Cook, meanwhile, joined the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee). The two built the first church building on land set aside by Chacko. A number of early leaders, including Rev. K. E. Abraham, worked hand in hand with Cook to establish numerous works in various parts of Kerala. As time went by, disagreements over doctrine and organizational structure led to many of these early leaders parting ways. Disagreement with Chacko also resulted in Cook relocating the headquarters to Mulakuzha. The founder of the Ceylon Pentecostal Mission Rev. Ramankutty, later known as Pastor Paul, also worked with Cook for some time before starting off on his own path. Early leaders that worked with Cook in building up the Church of God in its early days in Mulakuzha include Rev. T.M. Varghese and Rev. U. Thomas. When laws were passed that forbade foreign missionaries in India, it was T.M. Varghese that served as the Field Secretary. When the church had developed to the point that it was granted its own leadership, Rev. U. Thomas served as the first Overseer. The Church was divided into three districts. These included Kerala State, Tamil Nadu and Central Region. Kerala State was later divided into two at the request of the brothers of low caste backgrounds. The new region was named Kerala Division and is now named Kerala Region, with headquarters in Kottayam. The region of Andra Pradesh was included. The work that was started and run by Rev. Samuel John was incorporated into the Church as the Northern Region. In the 1990s, under the leadership of Rev. K M Thankachan, the Central Region was divided into two regions with Mumbai as the headquarters of the Western Region and Kolkata as the headquarters of the Eastern Region. There are many departments now under the Church.

F-logic combines the advantages of conceptual modeling with object-oriented, frame-based languages and offers a declarative, compact and simple syntax, as well as the well-defined semantics of a logic-based language. Features include, among others, object identity, complex objects, inheritance, polymorphism, query methods, encapsulation. F-logic stands in the same relationship to object-oriented programming as classical predicate calculus stands to relational database programming. Overview F-logic was developed by Michael Kifer at Stony Brook University and Georg Lausen at the University of Mannheim. F-logic was originally developed for deductive databases, but is now most frequently used for semantic technologies, especially the semantic web. F-logic is considered as one of the formalisms for ontologies, but description logic (DL) is more popular and accepted, as is the DL-based OWL. A development environment for F-logic was developed in the NeOn project and is also used in a range of applications for information integration, question answering and semantic search. Prior to the version 4 of Prot√©g√© ontology editor, F-Logic is supported as one of the two kinds of ontology. The frame syntax of the Rule Interchange Format Basic Logic Dialect (RIF BLD) standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium is based on F-logic; RIF BLD however does not include non-monotonic reasoning features of F-logic. In contrast to description logic based ontology formalism the semantics of F-logic are normally that of a closed world assumption as opposed to DL's open world assumption. Also, F-logic is generally undecidable, whereas the SHOIN description logic that OWL DL is based on is decidable. However it is possible to represent more expressive statements in F-logic than are possible with description logics. The most comprehensive description of F-logic was published in 1995.M. Kifer, G. Lausen, J. Wu (1995). \\"Logical foundations of object-oriented and frame-based languages\\", Journal of the ACM 42(4), July 1995, 741‚Äì843. The preliminary paperM. Kifer and G. Lausen (1989). \\"F-logic: a higher-order language for reasoning about objects, inheritance, and scheme\\", ACM SIGMOD Record 18(2), June 1989, 134‚Äì146. M. Kifer and G. Lausen (1997). \\"F-logic: a higher-order language for reasoning about objects, inheritance, and scheme\\", re-issued 1997. from 1989 won the 1999 Test of Time Award from ACM SIGMOD. A follow-up paperM. Kifer, W. Kim, Y. Sagiv (1992). \\"Querying object-oriented databases\\", ACM SIGMOD Record 21(2), June 1992, 393‚Äì402. from 1992 won the 2002 Test of Time Award from ACM SIGMOD.  F-logic syntax  Classes and individuals may be defined in F-logic as follows: man::person. woman::person. brad:man. angelina:woman. This states, that \\"men and women are persons\\" and that \\"Brad is a man\\", and \\"Angelina is a woman\\". Statements about classes and individuals may be made as follows: person[hasSon=>man]. brad[hasSon->{maddox,pax}]. married(brad,angelina). This defines that \\"the son of a person is a man\\", \\"Maddox and Pax are the sons of Brad\\" and \\"Brad and Angelina are married\\". In addition it is possible to represent axioms in F-logic in the following manner: man(X) <\\\\- person(X) AND NOT woman(X). X:person[hasFather->Y] <\\\\- Y:man[hasSon -> X]. These mean \\"X is a man if X is a person but not a woman\\" and \\"if X is the son of Y then X is a person and Y is the father of X\\". The Flora-2 system introduced a number of changes to the syntax of F-logic, making it more suitable for a knowledge representation and reasoning system as opposed to just a theoretical logic. In particular, variables became prefixed with a ?-mark, the distinction between functional and multi-valued properties was dropped and replaced by cardinality constraints, plus other important changes. For instance, the above pair of sentences look like this in Flora-2: man(?X) <\\\\- person(?X) \\\\and af woman(?X). ?X:person[hasFather->?Y] <\\\\- ?Y:man[hasSon -> ?X]. Here is default negation (\\"naf\\" stands for negation-as-failure based on the well-founded semantics); Flora-2 also supports so-called explicit negation, which is closer to negation in classical logic.

The property is nationally significant as a well-preserved example of a Gilded Age \\"ornamental farm\\", developed in the late 19th century with architecture by Robert Henderson Robertson and landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted. Description and history Shelburne Farms was created in 1886 by Dr. William Seward Webb and Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt Webb as a model agricultural estate, using money inherited from railroad magnate William Henry Vanderbilt. They commissioned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to guide the layout of of farm, field and forest, and New York architect Robert Henderson Robertson, to design the buildings. The estate was created by purchasing a large number of mostly agricultural properties, and then adapting the existing roads and lanes (some of which were public ways the Webbs petitioned to have closed) to fulfill the Webbs' vision for the estate. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2001. Shelburne Farms was incorporated as a nonprofit educational organization in 1972 by descendants of the Webbs. Nearly of sustainably managed woodlands received Green Certification from the Forest Stewardship Council in 1998. The farm's grass-based dairy supports a herd of 125 purebred, registered Brown Swiss cows. Their milk is made into farmhouse cheddar cheese. The farm serves as an educational resource by practicing rural land use that is environmentally, economically and culturally sustainable. Visitors may enjoy the walking trails, children's farmyard, inn, restaurant, property tours and special events.

He was CEO of Enron Energy Services from March 1997 until January 2001 and CEO of Enron Xcelerator, a venture capital division of Enron, from February 2001 until June 2001. He left Enron with over $250 million. Pai was the second-largest land owner in Colorado after he purchased the Taylor Ranch for $23 million in 1999, though he sold the property in June 2004 for $60 million. Pai was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing in the Enron scandal and exercised his 5th Amendment rights in regard to the subsequent Enron class action lawsuits. However, as a result of the lawsuit, Pai forfeited $6 million due to him from Enron's insurance policy for company officers to a fund for Enron shareholders. Accounts of the Enron scandal have frequently portrayed him as a mysterious figure; a former Enron employee, interviewed in the 2005 documentary film Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, referred to Pai as \\"the invisible CEO\\". Background Pai was born in Nanjing, China and came to the United States at the age of two. Pai obtained both his B.S. and M.S. in economics from the University of Maryland, College Park, where his father, Shih-I Pai, was an aeronautics professor. Pai worked for the federal government in the 1970s before joining Enron. His sister is Sue Pai Yang, the first Asian American appointed to be a New Jersey Workers' Compensation judge. Enron Pai joined Enron in 1987, when it was just a regional energy supplier. He became one of (eventual) CEO Jeffrey Skilling's top lieutenants, primarily tasked with detailing and implementing Skilling's vision of transforming Enron into a de facto energy commodities-trading firm. During his Enron career, Skilling put Pai in charge of multiple Enron subsidiaries. Pai was CEO of the EES (Enron Energy Services) subsidiary from March 1997 until May 2001. The reasons for his resignation from Enron remain shrouded in mystery. Despite a reputation for being extremely introverted, taciturn, and reclusive around the office, Pai also came to symbolize the legendary lavishness and excesses of Enron's corporate culture. Though married, Pai was known to spend inordinate amounts of time during and after working hours in Houston-area strip clubs, use the Enron corporate jet for personal commuting, and charge several hundred dollars worth of lunches for himself and accompanying staff to the corporate expense account until Chairman Ken Lay later prohibited it. Between May 18 and June 7, 2001, Pai sold 338,897 shares of Enron stock and exercised Enron stock options that put another 572,818 shares on the open market. At the time, the price averaged $53.78 per share. This early sell-off of Enron stock had the benefit of shielding Pai from the insider trading charges leveled against other Enron executives who had also secretly sold-off large amounts of stock before the company's ruinous finances were publicly known. Pai's Colorado ranchland included the 14,047-foot mountain, Culebra Peak. His neighbors reportedly referred to the ranch as \\"Mount Pai\\". Post-Enron Pai was a founder and is a former chairman of Element Markets, a renewable-energy consulting firm. Through Element, Pai has invested in pollution emissions credits. Since then, Pai has emerged as a partner in Midstream Capital Partners LLC. On July 30, 2008, Pai agreed to resolve civil insider trading charges against him with an out-of-court settlement of $31.5 million, including $1.5 million in civil fines and $30 million in restitution, to be deposited into a fund for shareholders harmed by Enron's bankruptcy. He continues to neither admit nor deny the Securities and Exchange Commission claims that he sold millions of shares of Enron stock based on non-public information about the company's financial problems. It is one of the largest settlements in the history of the SEC's enforcement program dealing with an individual for alleged insider trading. As part of the settlement, Pai was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Personal life Pai's frequent strip club visits during his time with Enron led to an affair with stripper Melanie Fewell (who was also married), and resulted in a pregnancy. Upon learning of the affair, Pai's then-wife of over 20 years, Lanna, with whom he has two biological children, filed for divorce. To satisfy the financial terms of his divorce settlement, Pai cashed out approximately $250 million of his Enron stock just months before the company's stock price dramatically collapsed and it filed for bankruptcy protection. After the divorce, Pai and Fewell married. Pai and Fewell together operated Canaan Ranch, located near metropolitan Houston, where they raised and trained dressage horses. They later moved from Sugar Land, Texas, to Middleburg, Virginia, and opened a second Canaan Ranch there, but as of 2014, it is up for sale. More recently, Pai and his family have moved to Wellington, Florida. some more information on Canaan Ranch: See also *Enron scandal References External links *Information from CORPWATCH on Lou Pai Category:Enron people Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Chinese descent Category:University of Maryland, College Park alumni Category:Enron scandal Category:People from Middleburg, Virginia Category:People from Sugar Land, Texas Category:Businesspeople from Nanjing Category:Chinese Civil War refugees ","title":"Lou Pai"},{"id":"4880354","text":"Kyai Gedhe Pamanahan was the first ruler of the Sultanate of Mataram.

The stove was based on the design of the hand-held blowtorch; Lindqvist‚Äôs patent covered the burner, which was turned upward on the stove instead of outward as on the blowtorch.Swedish Patent No. 3944 (Nov. 19, 1892) The same year, Lindqvist partnered with and established J.V. Svenson‚Äôs Kerosene Stove Factory for manufacturing the new stoves which were sold under the name Primus. The first model was the No.1 stove, which was quickly followed by a number of similarly- designed stoves of different models and sizes. Primus Catalog No. 2 (Sept. 1, 1897) Shortly thereafter, B.A. Hjorth & Co. (later Bahco), a tool and engineering firm begun in Stockholm in 1889, acquired the exclusive rights to sell the Primus stove. A. Room, \\"Dictionary of Trade Name Origins,\\" p.142 (NTC Business Books 2d Ed. 1991) The efficient Primus stove quickly earned a reputation as a reliable and durable stove in everyday use, and it performed especially well under adverse conditions: it was the stove of choice for Fridtjof Nansen's North Pole attempt, Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition, R. Amundsen, \\"The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the Fram,1910-1912,\\" Vol. 1, p.63 (Kessinger Publishing 2004) and Richard Byrd‚Äôs North Pole expedition. L.

Hillary, ‚ÄúView from the Summit,‚Äù p.2 (Simon & Schuster 2000) While many other companies also made portable stoves of a similar design to the Primus, this style is often generically referred to as a ‚ÄúPrimus‚Äù stove, regardless of the manufacturer. H. Manning, ‚ÄúBackpacking, One Step at a Time,‚Äù p.274 (Vintage Books 1980) Construction The Primus No. 1 stove, made of brass, consists of a fuel tank at the base, above which is a \\"rising tube\\" and the burner assembly. A steel top ring on which to set a pot is held above the burner by three support legs. Other Primus-style stoves may be larger or smaller, but have the same basic design. The No. 1 stove weighs about , and measures about high with an overall diameter of just under . The tank, about high, holds a little over of kerosene and will burn for about four hours on a full tank. Primus Catalog No. 17100E, p.2 (1971) Principle of operation rightthumb275px Illustration of Burner Assembly. A: Rising tube (from fuel tank); B: Ascending tube; C: Burner head; D: Descending tube; E: Vapor nozzle. The ascending tubes and descending tubes are at right angles to one another. Primus Stove components To light the stove, the user pours a small amount of alcohol into a circular \\"spirit cup\\" just below the burner and lights it to heat the burner assembly. When it is hot, the user pressurizes the tank by means of a small hand pump integrated into the housing, which forces kerosene from the tank up through the rising tube (A) and the ascending pipe (B) to the pre-heated burner head (C), where the fuel is heated and vaporized. The kerosene vapour is then forced under pressure through the descending tube (D) to the vapor nozzle (E); here it sprays through a jet in the middle of the burner, where it mixes with air and burns in a sootless blue flame. The heat from that flame vaporizes more fuel to sustain the process when the spirit cup burns out. The user can pump the tank more to increase the pressure and make the flame larger; turning a small \\"air screw\\" (usually located in the filler cap) will release pressure from the tank and make the flame smaller. Primus \\"Instructions for use\\" Hang Tag (undated, circa 1935) If no alcohol is available for lighting, a twist of cloth or even dry grass will form a wick in the spirit cup. Pumping once will dispense a small amount of kerosene to dribble down into the cup which will then light using the wick. As the flame dies down, a further gentle pump will either ignite the main burner or dispense more kerosene into the spirit cup. Prior to the introduction of the Primus, kerosene stoves were constructed in the same manner as oil lamps, which use a wick to draw fuel from the tank to the burner and which produce a great deal of soot due to incomplete combustion. The Primus stove's design, which uses pressure and heat to vaporize the kerosene before ignition, results in a hotter, more efficient stove that does not soot.C. Hale, \\"Domestic Science, Part II\\" pp.81-82 (Cambridge University Press 1916) Because it did not use a wick and did not produce soot, the Primus stove was advertised as the first \\"sootless\\" and \\"wickless\\" stove.

His name is the second listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Life and career Chester M. Ovnand (also called \\"Chet\\") was from Copperas Cove, Texas and was born to Engebret Ovnand and Maybelle Welch. Army records conflict as to what his actual name was--Charles Melvin Ovnand or Chester Melvin Ovnard--though that the latter appears on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is possibly an indication of general consensus among the Memorial's planners. On July 8th, 1959 he and Major Dale R. Buis (visiting from MAAG 5) were killed at Bien Hoa, 20 miles northeast of Saigon. He was part of the Military Assistance Advisory Group 7 sent to train the South Vietnam army. The Viet Cong attacked the mess hall where he and five officers were watching the movie The Tattered Dress. M/Sgt Ovnand switched on the lights to change to the next reel, when VC guerrillas poked their weapons through the windows and sprayed the room with automatic weapons fire. M/Sgt Ovnand was hit with several 9mm rounds. He immediately switched the lights off and headed to the top of the stairs, where he was able to turn on the exterior flood lights. He died from his wounds on the stairs. Major Buis, at that time, was crawling towards the kitchen doors. When the exterior flood lights came on, he must have seen an attacker coming through the kitchen doors. He got up and rushed towards the attacker, but was only able to cover 15 feet before being fatally hit from behind. His actions startled the attacker who was about to throw his satchel charge through the door. The attacker's satchel charge had already been activated and his moment of hesitation caused him to blow himself up. Two South Vietnamese guards that were on duty that night were also killed by the Viet Cong. The wounded were Captain Howard Boston (MAAG 7) and the Vietnamese cook's eight-year-old son.

Pulmonary irritant receptors (cough receptors) in the epithelium of the respiratory tract are sensitive to both mechanical and chemical stimuli. The bronchi and trachea are so sensitive to light touch that slight amounts of foreign matter or other causes of irritation initiate the cough reflex. The larynx and carina are especially sensitive. Terminal bronchioles and even the alveoli are sensitive to chemical stimuli such as sulfur dioxide gas or chlorine gas. Rapidly moving air usually carries with it any foreign matter that is present in the bronchi or trachea. Stimulation of the cough receptors by dust or other foreign particles produces a cough, which is necessary to remove the foreign material from the respiratory tract before it reaches the lungs Physiology of cough The cough receptors or rapidly adapting irritant receptors are located mainly on the posterior wall of the trachea, pharynx, and at the carina of trachea, the point where the trachea branches into the main bronchi. The receptors are less abundant in the distal airways, and absent beyond the respiratory bronchioles. When triggered, impulses travel via the internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve which stems from the vagus nerve (CN X), to the medulla of the brain. This is the afferent neural pathway. Unlike other areas responsible for involuntary actions like swallowing, there is no definitive area that has been identified as the cough center in the brain. The efferent neural pathway then follows, with relevant signals transmitted back from the cerebral cortex and medulla via the vagus and superior laryngeal nerves to the glottis, external intercostals, diaphragm, and other major inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The mechanism of a cough is as follows: * Diaphragm (innervated by phrenic nerve) and external intercostal muscles (innervated by segmental intercostal nerves) contract, creating a negative pressure around the lung. * Air rushes into the lungs in order to equalise the pressure. * The glottis closes (muscles innervated by recurrent laryngeal nerve) and the vocal cords contract to shut the larynx. * The abdominal muscles contract to accentuate the action of the relaxing diaphragm; simultaneously, the other expiratory muscles contract. These actions increase the pressure of air within the lungs. * The vocal cords relax and the glottis opens, releasing air at over 100 mph. * The bronchi and non-cartilaginous portions of the trachea collapse to form slits through which the air is forced, which clears out any irritants attached to the respiratory lining. Stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve supplying the ear may also elicit a cough. This ear-cough reflex is also known as Arnold's reflex. Weakness of the respiratory muscles, tracheostomy, or vocal cord pathology (including paralysis or anesthesia) may prevent effective clearing of the airways. Dysfunction The reflex is impaired in the person whose abdominals and respiratory muscles are weak. This problem can be caused by disease conditions that lead to muscle weakness or paralysis, by prolonged inactivity, or as outcome of surgery involving these muscles. Bed rest interferes with the expansion of the chest and limits the amount of air that can be taken into the lungs in preparation for coughing, making the cough weak and ineffective. This reflex may also be impaired by damage to the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve which relays the afferent branch of the reflex arc. This nerve is most commonly damaged by swallowing a foreign object, such as a chicken bone, resulting in it being lodged in the piriform recess (in the laryngopharynx) or by surgical removal of said object. Testing The cough reflex can be tested by inhaling air with nebulized 200¬µmol/l capsaicin.

Porter was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and graduated from Shawnee High School in 1955, then went on to earn a radio journalism degree at the University of Oklahoma. His broadcasting career began in 1953 at age 14 when he broadcast a few innings in several games involving Shawnee's Class D baseball team, the Hawks, a Los Angeles Dodgers farm club, over KGFF. At age 15, Porter was elevated to play-by-play man of the Shawnee Wolves' football and basketball broadcasts and the Hawks when the regular announcer resigned. At a high school football game one night, Ross was introduced by his father to the legendary Jim Thorpe. After earning his college degree, Porter was hired by WKY radio in Oklahoma City as a newscaster. He also was a sports anchor for WKY-TV, and at age 24 became the youngest recipient of the Oklahoma Sportscaster of the Year award, and the youngest state winner ever in the nation. Ross repeated the next year. Between 1960 and 1966, he did the play- by-play of the previous day's OU football game on channel 4's one-hour \\"Sunday Playback Show.\\" In 1966, at age 27, he left for Los Angeles and subsequently spent 10 years as a sportscaster for KNBC-TV in Los Angeles. He worked alongside Tom Snyder on the 6 PM news and Tom Brokaw on the 11PM news. Porter won two local Emmys. Porter worked for NBC Sports in the early 1970s, calling NFL football from 1970‚Äì76 and Pacific-8 college basketball from 1972-76. Ross was the halftime host of the 1974 Final Four on NBC, the sideline reporter for the network telecast of the 1975 Rose Bowl and was in the tower covering one hole for NBC at the Bing Crosby Pebble Beach golf tournament. Porter had to give up his NBC assignments when he joined the Dodgers in 1977 due to an overlap in seasons. He later was the radio and television voice of UNLV Rebels football and basketball from 1978-92. During the 1970s, Porter had been the television play-by-play announcer for the high school basketball Game of The Week on KNBC showing matchups between Los Angeles area teams. Former Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax worked as a game analyst with Ross the first year. One of their games went five overtimes. Ross was rated among the top 60 baseball announcers of all-time by Curt Smith in his book Voices of Summer. Ross Porter is the only broadcaster to have been the voice of a World Series champion (the 1981 and 1988 Dodgers) and a college basketball champion (with UNLV in 1990). In 1968, Porter was honored as a Distinguished Alum of the University of Oklahoma. Porter was known for providing fans with statistical information on players during his broadcasts. He was the host of a pregame and postgame radio show known as DodgerTalk for 14 years, answering phone calls from listeners with questions pertaining to baseball. He was voted Los Angeles Sportstalk Host of the Year the first three years the award was presented by the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association,and later won it a fourth time. Ross was inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2005 with Vin Scully, his colleague of 28 years, as his presenter. In 2007, Porter received the Bill Teegins Excellence in Sportscasting Award from the Oklahoma Sports Museum. On August 23, 1989, Porter set a major league baseball record for broadcasting 22 straight innings on radio by himself in a six-hour, 14 minute game against the Expos in Montreal. Porter helped broadcast the 1977 World Series and 1978 World Series, both involving the Dodgers, on over 600 CBS Radio stations around the world. Ross also did Game of the Week broadcasts for CBS Radio in the 1980s and '90s. His most famous national call is from the sixth and final game of the 1977 Series, during which Reggie Jackson smacked three home runs on three consecutive pitches. The capper: :Jackson with four runs batted in - sends a fly ball to center field and deep! That's going to be way back and THAT'S going to be gone! Reggie Jackson has hit his third home run of the game! Porter began a new venture called Real Sports Heroes with Ross Porter in April 2007. Real Sports Heroes highlighted the positive side of athletics and the great things that some athletes are doing and have done to give something back to the community. Porter aired 90-second Real Sports Heroes vignettes on KLAC and KABC radio in Los Angeles. The vignettes and Porter's web site were sponsored by American Airlines. Porter aired high school football games for the IBN Sports Network in 2011, and joined Fox Sports West in 2012 to announce prep football, basketball, and baseball contests. In 2016, Porter became the announcer for the Cal State Northridge Matadors baseball team, and the home games can be heard online at GoMatadors.com. For the last four years, Ross has written a weekly column during baseball season for \\"Dodgers Dugout,\\" a newsletter published by the Los Angeles Times. Titled \\"Ask Ross,\\" fans from around the world pose baseball questions which he answers. Since 2006, he has hosted a charity golf tournament each November to raise funds for his clinical psychologist son's non-profit organization, Stillpoint Family Resources. Stillpoint was founded when Ross and Lin's first grandson was born with Down Syndrome. John Michael underwent three heart surgeries in the first 18 months of his life and today is the joy of the family. Over 90 celebrities have participated in the tournament, Ross Porter Celebrity Golf Classic, played in Southern California. http://myinforms.com/en-us/a/27713976-at-cal-state- northridge-ross-porter-is-a-voice-from-the-past/ References Category:Living people Category:1938 births Category:American radio sports announcers Category:American television sports announcers Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:College football announcers Category:High school basketball announcers in the United States Category:High school football announcers in the United States Category:Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasters Category:Los Angeles Raiders broadcasters Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:National Football League announcers Category:Sportspeople from Shawnee, Oklahoma Category:Television anchors from Los Angeles Category:University of Nevada, Las Vegas Category:UNLV Rebels football Category:UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball Category:University of Oklahoma alumni Category:Shawnee High School (Oklahoma) alumni ","title":"Ross Porter (sportscaster)"},{"id":"4880462","text":"The True Story of the Bridgewater Astral League is the first album by The World/Inferno Friendship Society.

Historia de los Partidos Pol√≠ticos Puertorrique√±os (1898-1956). San Juan, Puerto Rico: Litograf√≠a Real Hermanos, Inc. 1959. Tomo I. p. 114. (Spanish: Partido Unionista, PU), was a major political party in Puerto Rico in the early 20th century. The Union of Puerto Rico was known as the dominant political party of the island from 1904 to 1932. UPR founder Luis Mu√±oz Rivera also founded La Democracia, which effectively acted as the UPR publication. On 19 February 1904, the Union of Puerto Rico party became the first mass party to advocate for independence for Puerto Rico in the form of a sovereign nation. Founding Union of Puerto Rico was founded in February 1902 by Luis Mu√±oz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintr√≥n, Antonio R. Barcel√≥, Jos√© de Diego, Juan V√≠as Ochoteco and others after the disbanding of the Federal Party following the party's withdrawal in the election of 1900. The party formed under a platform of greater autonomy for Puerto Rico as a result of the group's dissatisfaction, and frustration, with the Foraker Act.  Platform  = Autonomy = The UPR, initially, had a platform that pushed for the separation of the cabinet and legislature, for Puerto Ricans to have more cabinet positions, for a less powerful governor and the governor's appointments in hopes that Puerto Ricans could have more influence and participation within their own government. = Jones Act and Realignment = From 1913 to 1915 Luis Mu√±oz Rivera attempted to amend the Jones Act, during its creation, in order to incorporate Puerto Rican autonomy into the act. Rivera attempted to reform the acts incorporation of aspects similar to the older Olmstead Act, especially aspects of United States civil government. Mu√±oz's campaign for amendments to the eventual Jones act was systemic from the fact he viewed it as \\"ultra-conservative\\", and wanted to try and realize Puerto Rican autonomy. The most divisive aspect of the Jones act was United States citizenship for Puerto Ricans. Both Mu√±oz, and the UPR delegates in Washington opposed Puerto Rican-U.S. Citizenship. Mu√±oz, in February 1914, introduced his own bill for the continuation of Puerto Rican citizenship- supported by the UPR delegates. However, dejected, the UPR delegates eventually chose to accept the provision \\"of individual citizenship outlined in the Shafroth bill\\". Mu√±oz's patience and diligence regarding the tentative Jones Bill, was challenged by the radical Jose De Diego (another UPR leader) who sought quick resolution for Puerto Rican independence. This division regarding ideology within the party came to be resolved at the UPR convention, in 1915. The party, according to Munoz, came to the conclusion that; > The Unionist party . . . by a vote of 106 against 35 resolved to follow a > policy entirely along the lines of self-government. The party shall confine > its activities to demanding home rule leaving the independence plank in its > platform simply as an ideal until some future convention shall determine the > date on which the said plank shall be considered a party issue‚Ä¶ Following the death of Munoz, in 1916, this new platform became permanent, as Munoz's death created poignancy regarding his final public goal for the UPR. The party, thusly, began to take a more conservative platform regarding Puerto Rican autonomy. Eventually, in 1920, the party would even work for the expansion of the Jones Act in order to maintain United States relations that they hoped could guarantee eventual Puerto Rican autonomy. Dissent In 1913 a small pro-independence faction (known as the independistas) occurs with Jos√© de Diego as a response to the Jones Act. While one of the earliest examples of dissent within the party, de Diego subsequently accepted the Jones Act (in line with his party) in order to retain his position within the legislature. Various members of the party felt that the Union Party was not doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rican independence. In 1919, Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠ quit the party and with his followers founded Asociaci√≥n Nacionalista de Puerto Rico (English: Nationalist Association) in San Juan. The Nationalist Association had a youth group called the Juventud Nacionalista (English: Nationalist Youth) which was at that time presided over by Jos√© Paniagua. The Nationalist Youth was then composed of students from the University of Puerto Rico and high school students.Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico Other high- ranking members who also felt as Coll y Cuch√≠ and quit the party were Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a (father of Ricardo Alegr√≠a) and Eugenio Font Su√°rez, co-founded the Independence Association of Puerto Rico (Asociaci√≥n Independentista).Ley N√∫m. 282 del a√±o 2006 Birth of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party On September 17, 1922, the Independence Association merged with Coll y Cuch√≠'s Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico and the Nationalist Youth (Juventud Nacionalista) political organizations to form the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Reorganization In 1921 president Harding appointed E. Mont Reily as governor of Puerto Rico. While the UPR had historically been amicable with Puerto Rican Governors, Reily retaliated against the UPR as their platform was one of Puerto Rican independence. Facing new political pushback, that included members of the UPR no longer being appointed to government positions, the UPR completely removed Puerto Rican independence from their platform and instead campaigned for an Estado Libre Asociado (English: Free Associated State) on February 11, 1922. The ELA would have effectively allowed Puerto Ricans to be elected as their own governors, by extending U.S. citizenship, and would have removed Reily from office as a result. The ELA, and change in platform, drew criticism as being bourgeois especially from more radical factions within the UPR- this faction created the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. = Formation of Alianza = In 1924, the Union Party joined with dissident members of the Republican Party to form the Alianza (English: Alliance), a political coalition. In elections, both parties would be on the ballot but their individual votes would be combined as one coalition. Criticism by the more liberal faction of the Puerto Rican Republican Party, and Socialist Party in 1920 regarding Puerto Rico's status lead to the eventual formation of Coalicion. With the growing influence, and organization, of radical parties caused concern within the UPR. The more liberal factions became more popular with the male laboring class. Similar concerns for the UPR arose with female suffrage, achieved in 1924. The response was the creation of Alianza. = Liberal Party = In 1932, the Alianza reconstituted itself as the Liberal Party and formally endorsed independence. The Alianza's more conservative, pro-statehood, faction broke off and joined with the Republicans to form the Republican Union. Demise In 1920, after the UPR changed their platform for the expansion of the Jones Act, the UPR experienced criticism by the pro-independence faction of the Puerto Rican Republican Party and the Socialist Party for creating new uncertainty regarding the island's status. Fuerza Viva, the farmers association at the time, became especially critical of the UPR as their rhetoric began to emphasis greater foreign economic relations. Fuerza Viva, as a result, began to criticize the UPR and in 1926 began an attack against UPR leader Antonio R. Barcelo. Barcelo was accused of being a socialist by Fuerza Viva. Throughout the 1920s, while remaining the dominant political party of the island, the UPR experienced a loss of popularity as their image (especially after the formation of the Alianza) because associated with being bourgeois, and politically conservative.

Oughton received her B.A. from Bryn Mawr College. After graduation, Oughton went to Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program to teach the young and older indigenous Indians.FBI files part 2, pg. 3. After returning to the U.S, she worked at the Children's Community School in Ann Arbor, Michigan while getting her master's degree at the University of Michigan. She became very active in SDS, eventually becoming a full-time organizer and member of the Jesse James Gang.Powers, p. 87 With the split of SDS in 1969, she joined Weather Underground. Oughton died in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion in Greenwich Village, New York City, when a nail bomb she was constructing with Terry Robbins detonated. The event destroyed the building, killing Oughton, Robbins, and Ted Gold. The bomb was to be used that evening at a dance for noncommissioned officers and their dates at the Fort Dix, New Jersey Army base, to \\"bring the [Vietnam] war home\\".Powers, p. 183 Early life and education Oughton was born and raised in Dwight, Illinois, the eldest of four daughters. She played the piano and the flute as a child, and enjoyed the operas and plays that her parents took her to see in Chicago.Cantor 1 As a child, Oughton's father taught her to handle a shotgun to be used during the pheasant season with her father at the family's shooting preserve, and sometimes in the surrounding countryside of Dwight. Oughton learned to ride horses and had been a 4-H member.Powers 11 Her mother was Jane Boyce Oughton, and her father was James Henry Oughton, Jr., vice-president of the family bank and owner of a successful restaurant. James Oughton was a member of the Republican Party and was elected to the Illinois General Assembly, serving from 1964 to 1966. One of her paternal great- grandfathers was the founder of Dwight's Keeley Institute for Alcoholics, and another great-grandfather, William D. Boyce, founded the Boy Scouts of America.Powers, pp. 10-11 Diana Oughton left Dwight at the age of 14 to finish her high school education at the elite Madeira School in McLean, Virginia. In her senior year at Madeira, she was accepted by all of the Seven Sisters colleges.Powers/Franks, pg. 3 Oughton graduated high school in 1959, entering Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania as a German-language major. Oughton supported her Republican family's political values by opposing federal banking regulations, social security, and anything associated with big government. When she was 19, Oughton went to West Germany, under a program sponsored by Wayne State University of Detroit, to spend her junior year of college at the University of Munich. She rented a room from the former rector of the university, Gerhard Weber. Oughton became close friends with some of the German students, including Peter, with whom she had conversations late into the night. In the family-authorized biography, Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, author Thomas Powers noted Diana's recollection of a conversation with Peter that resonated with her: \\"He said...Hurrah for Socialism!\\" After her study abroad, Oughton returned to Bryn Mawr for her senior year. During this time, Oughton and many other students read and were influenced by the book Black Like Me. The author, John Howard Griffin, gave an account of what he encountered going to the Southern United States, disguised as an African American. The book had a profound effect on Oughton, prompting her to volunteer in 1962 to tutor African American children in an impoverished section of Philadelphia. Oughton once told her sister Carol how amazed she was that there were seventh graders she was tutoring who could not read.Powers/Frank, pg. 3 Guatemala After receiving her B.A. degree from Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton spent the next two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school.Powers/Franks 2 Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated indigenous market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out.Powers 34 Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once.Varon 47 While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse.Ayers 95 During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton came to the conclusion that no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements. According to Thomas Powers, the author of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she reflected on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost an insult to the impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was nothing to be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too.Powers 35 Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States. Those who knew Oughton recognized this period as the major turning point in her life; according to Powers, Oughton came to feel something close to a sense of shame at being American.Powers 37 In Fugitive Days, Bill Ayers writes that Oughton \\"had had an abundance of experience in Guatemala, a torrent, almost more than she could endure. She now sometimes suffered the full flood of her experiences.\\"Ayers 94 Oughton became much more aware of the United States' impact on foreign countries, and she did not return to Philadelphia the same Midwest Republican. Oughton's old friends from college noticed upon her return to the United States how she had matured, while also displaying sadness regarding the poverty she encountered in Guatemala in the previous two years.Powers 31 Children‚Äôs Community School In 1966, Oughton left Philadelphia for Ann Arbor, Michigan to enroll in the University of Michigan Graduate School of Education, seeking her Master of Arts degree in teaching. In Michigan, she began to work part-time at the Children's Community School (CCS), a project established by Toby HendonPowers 33 and based on the Summerhill method of education. Children were allowed to do what they liked when they liked, on the premise that both teaching and learning were most successful when most spontaneous.Powers 59 The CCS mission was to treat the children with love and understanding, in hopes that violent thoughts would not consume the child's personality. The school also tried to establish complete equality between white and black students and to involve parents in the running of the school, so that it might be a community in the largest sense of the word.Powers 61 Later in 1966 Oughton dropped almost all of her other commitments to work full-time at CCS. She designed a fund-raising button with a smiling face and the words, CHILDREN ARE ONLY NEWER PEOPLE.Powers 69 It was at CCS that Oughton met CCS teacher Bill Ayers. The two fell in love and soon began living together. In 1968, the school ran into severe problems, such as the fact that few students learned to read, and lost its funding, so Oughton and Ayers sought to become active elsewhere in the community. SDS and the Jesse James Gang Ayers and Oughton were involved with Students for a Democratic Society while working at CCS, but it was not until after the closure of the school that they became involved as full-time organizers. Their lives became consumed by meetings, organizing, and planning actions.Powers 39 It was during this time that Ayers and Oughton met Terry Robbins. In March 1968, Oughton helped create a women's liberation group.Powers 73 The group met every week or so, wherever the women could find room. Most of the talk seemed to center on the subordinate role of women in the radical movement and on the sexual oppression of women by the \\"macho\\" tendency of males to regard sex as conquest. During these meetings Oughton often discussed the role that women played in the SDS, which was a combination of being a sexual object, an office clerk, and a housekeeper.Powers, p. 41 Later in 1968, Oughton told a friend that while she was away for five days, Ayers had slept with other women. She told the friend she tried to convince herself that it didn't matter, but it did. Also in 1968, Oughton and Ayers became part of the Jesse James Gang, which banded together with about 40 others against the moderates. The Jesse James Gang replaced the University of Michigan SDS chapter, and Robbins, Oughton, and Ayers worked in partnership with Jim Mellen from the Revolutionary Youth Movement Group.Varon 40 The Vietnam War entered its third year in the middle of 1968. The early student movement had taken their moral stance from the teachings of Albert Camus, who taught that thinking men have the responsibility to find a way in the world to be neither a victim or the executioner. Four events in 1968 turned the American student movement into self-proclaimed Marxist‚ÄìLeninist revolutionaries: the Viet Cong's Tet Offensive, the student sit-in at Columbia University, the near-revolution in France, and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Each event helped change the way American radicals viewed their own situations. By the end of 1968, the revolutionaries were tired of waiting for change and no longer had allegiance to or trust in America's democracy. One of the few actions by the Jesse James Gang occurred on the University of Michigan campus while Robben Fleming, the university president, was speaking to a group of students inside a school building. Oughton spoke outside with a portable address system, while the Jesse James Gang handed out sliced pieces of bread, shouting, \\"Here's the bread. Get the baloney inside.\\" The 1968 annual national SDS convention was held at Michigan State University. Oughton and Ayers were participants sponsored by Eric Chester, who was a Voice-SDS leader in Ann Arbor. The Gang insisted that action was the only thing likely to create a situation in which radical solutions to American problems would be considered.Powers 89 The Gang offered a tight, validating community within which members could express their rage and frustration about the status quo and their empathy for suffering.Wilkerson 226 Weatherman With the split of SDS in 1969, Oughton and Ayers joined the Weatherman faction. Oughton's sense of herself made it more difficult to get along with her father; she saw her parents' lives in Dwight, Illinois, as complacent and secure, and lives in the impoverished sections of Chicago and Detroit as chaotic.Powers 49 At this time, SDS protests became more violent and radical. Oughton and Ayers had been drifting apart since December 1968. Monogamy, according to Ayers, would interfere with his political work. Oughton replaced her old friends, and she abandoned teaching, for politics was now her life. Merrill Rosenberg told Oughton, \\"Revolution means violence and risk, or it is only talk. The Weathermen's arguments pointed to their conclusion that the time was now to fight.\\" In August 1969, Oughton participated in an SDS delegation that traveled to Cuba for the third meeting between Vietnamese and American delegates. The Vietnamese called the meeting to discuss progress taken in the peace movement as the war in Vietnam was entering its final stages. Oughton was impressed by Cuba's progress in literacy and medical treatment.Powers 63 The pace of movement toward action within the Weathermen picked up soon after their return from Cuba.Long 7 Oughton and 75 other Weatherwomen drove to Pittsburgh on September 3, 1969, after attending a caucus in Cleveland to take part in what the Weathermen Group called a practice run of the \\"Days of Rage\\". On the morning of September 4, 20 Weatherwomen entered the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) office and held the office workers captive until the Weatherwomen had run off copies of a leaflet to be handed out to student sympathizers. One of the Weatherwomen told Miss Dodd, who worked in the AFSC office, \\"We thought until now you were on our side. Now we know you are a member of the enemy.\\" A short time later, all 75 Weatherwomen appeared at South Hills High School in Pittsburgh to participate in a \\"jailbreak\\". The women spray painted anti-war slogans, \\"Ho lives\\" and \\"Free Huey\\", on the school's main entrance doors, and handed out leaflets, urging high school students to \\"bring the war home,\\" and asking students to leave the school campus. Some Weatherwomen made speeches in the school's playground about racism, imperialism, and the SDS national action plans. Oughton was able to escape from the Pittsburgh police, but 26 others, including Cathy Wilkerson and Jane Spielman, were arrested at the school. The students at the high school had no idea who the Weatherwomen were, or even why the women chose their school. Part of this move toward greater violence was seen during the \\"Days of Rage\\" in Chicago, which took place October 8‚Äì11, 1969. One purpose of the \\"Days of Rage\\" was to create an image of strength and determination that would win converts to revolutionary violence.Powers 135 Weathermen gathered at Grant Park, around a fire made from nearby park benches. They listened to leaders' speeches about Che Guevara and the world revolution. The last speech spurred the group to head for the Drake Hotel, where federal judge Julius Hoffman resided. He was the presiding judge at the Chicago 8 trial. Weathermen took their helmets, clubs, and chains, entered the streets, and smashed car windshields and store windows.Powers 74 Oughton was one of those arrested on October 9 in Chicago, when police spied her keeping an eye out for other Weathermen who might turn up.Powers 75 Her bail was set at $5,000, which her father came up from Dwight to pay. Until Oughton's arrest, her family did not know who the Weathermen were or what they stood for. After she was released, Mr. Oughton dropped his daughter off at a church where she was meeting up with other Weathermen; shortly afterward, police raided the church and arrested 43 members of the group. Oughton managed to escape by jumping from a ground floor window.Powers 156 After the \\"Days of Rage\\", the group became increasingly violent. Oughton returned home for a short visit around Christmas Day 1969. She seemed pleased to receive some clothing items and other gifts from her family. Though she appeared thin and fatigued, her family did not press her to stay. Oughton left her parents' home for the last time to go to Flint, Michigan for the December 27 \\"War Council\\" meeting. Oughton made the decision at the meeting to go underground.Powers 77 In her book Flying Close to the Sun, former Weatherman member Cathy Wilkerson describes meeting with Terry Robbins, also a member of the Jesse James Gang, who told her about a small, semi-clandestine group in New York to which he belonged. He explained briefly that the group had already been active: a firebomb had been thrown at the home of Judge Murtagh, then presiding over the trial of the Panther 21.Wilkerson 324 When Wilkerson joined the collective, the members were in need of a place to stay. Wilkerson's father had a townhouse in New York and was to be away for a couple of weeks. Robbins wondered whether Wilkerson could get the keys.Wilkerson 332 She did so, and the group arrived at 18 West 11th Street to decide their next move. Jonah Raskin, whose wife Eleanor Raskin was part of the Weather Underground organization, and who was himself a courier for the Underground,Dohrn 124 recalls the last time he spoke with the members of the collective in New York: \\"I had talked to them not long before the townhouse blew up and they seemed to have lost touch with reality- and were incapable of making sensible decisions about almost everything.\\"Dohrn 126 Townhouse explosion On Monday, March 2, 1970, in Keene, New Hampshire, a Weatherman purchased two 50-pound cases of dynamite from the New England Explosives Corporation. Sometime that week, the dynamite was moved from Keene to Greenwich Village, New York, where it was taken to the house at 18 West Eleventh Street.Powers 183 Oughton left Detroit and joined the group at the house. On Friday of the same week, Oughton and Robbins were in the basement assembling a nail bomb when it detonated. Cathy Wilkerson, who was in the townhouse at the time, describes her experience during the explosion, \\"the idea that Terry and Diana were both in the subbasement overwhelmed everything else. As I forced my attention there and to them, my lungs expanded instantaneously to draw in air and dust so I could call out.\\"Wilkerson 346 Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin, another Weatherman in the townhouse at the time, were the only two to escape. When they ran out into the street, someone asked if there was anyone else in the house. Thinking that Ted Gold, the other Weatherman in the townhouse, had gone to the store, Wilkerson replied that there was no one left inside, as she was sure that Robbins and Oughton were dead.Wilkerson 347 Four days after the explosion, detectives found some of Oughton's remains near a workbench in the rubble-filled basement of the devastated townhouse. At the end of another week, a detective discovered the tip of the little finger from the right hand. A print taken by a police department expert was matched later that day with a set of Oughton's prints in the Washington files of the FBI.FBI files part 3 page 17 The prints they had on file were from Oughton's arrest in Chicago on October 9, 1969, during the \\"Days of Rage\\". It took four days to find Oughton's remains, not only because of the amount of destruction the bomb had caused‚Äîthe townhouse was destroyed‚Äîbut also because of the dynamite found in the wreckage. While searching through the rubble, detectives found four lead pipes, each in diameter and packed with dynamite.Powers 3 The street was cleared, the bomb- removal truck was summoned, and the search continued with considerable caution. Before the day was over, detectives found four cartons containing 57 sticks of dynamite, 30 blasting caps, and some cheap alarm clocks with holes drilled in their faces for wires. It was understood later that the bombs were to be detonated at a non-commissioned officers' dance at Fort Dix.Wilkerson 341 The doctor who examined Oughton's remains said that she had been standing within a foot or two of the bomb when it exploded. It may, in fact, have gone off in her hands. Ayers has raised the possibility that Oughton may have intentionally detonated the explosion, and it has been reported that a vicious argument occurred throughout the previous day and night in which Boudin favored using antipersonnel bombs, and that Oughton had misgivings. When Brian Flanagan reflects on his time as part of the Weather Underground Organization, he has this to say: \\"I was regretful over about 5 percent of what we did.\\" He added, \\"I think 95 percent of what we did was great, and we'd do it again.\\" \\"And what was the 5 percent? The town house.\\" When pressed, Flanagan said that he regretted \\"the deaths of the three Weathermen Ted Gold, Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins and the plan to bomb the dance at Fort Dix and the library at Columbia University, which could have taken lives.\\"Wakin 4 The Townhouse Explosion was the tragic and dramatic culmination of the grim political direction in which Weatherman had been headed.Berger 130 Laura Whitehorn, a former member of Weatherman, said: \\"We were out of touch with what was going on, and we lost sight of the fact that if you‚Äôre a revolutionary, the first thing you have to try to do is preserve human life.\\" The Weather Underground Organization dedicated their book Prairie Fire to Oughton (as well as Sirhan Sirhan and many others). Diana Oughton's mother was notified at the Oughton home by a member of the Dwight police force, once Oughton's identity had been confirmed. Mr. Oughton was on a business trip in London at the time of Diana's death. He stated in the Detroit Free Press that he was told on the phone that \\"his daughter's remains had been identified in a bombed Greenwich Village townhouse. She was a revolutionary terrorist and the bomb, intended for an adjunct of the Establishment in New York, had killed her by mistake.\\" Mr. Oughton also stated in the article: \\"I knew she had friends in radical politics and that she was traveling around the country organizing teach-ins. But even as late as the (1968) Democratic convention she refused to take part in the violence. I'm sure she did this with a crystal clear conscience. There was nothing egocentric or self-centered about it.\\" On Tuesday, March 24, 1970, Oughton was buried next to her grandparents in the family plot about a mile and a half outside of Dwight. Hundreds attended the funeral services. Some of the children Oughton had worked with at the Children's Community School pinned their fund-raising buttons, that Oughton had designed and made three years prior, to a bouquet of flowers at the explosion site. Cultural references =In film and television= Katherine (1975), loosely based on Oughton's life, is a TV movie starring Art Carney, Sissy Spacek, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, and Jane Wyatt, tells the story of \\"Katherine Alman\\", who was from a wealthy Denver family, became socially active, served as a teacher of English in South America, then joined a radical \\"collective\\" which had many similarities to the SDS and eventually the Weather Underground. The \\"collective\\" protested the Vietnam War, invaded a high school, held a \\"war council\\" and eventually split into peaceful and violent factions. The story ended with Katherine's death from the explosion of the bomb that detonated prematurely at a government building the violent faction had targeted. =In music= The song \\"Diana - Part 1\\", sung by Paul Kantner on the album Sunfighter (1971), was written in response to the story of Diana Oughton and the Weathermen. =In print= James Merrill, who had grown up in the townhouse that was owned by Cathy Wilkerson's father at the time of the bombing, wrote a poem titled \\"18 West 11th Street\\". Richard M. Pearlstein wrote The Mind of the Political Terrorist (1991), in which he attempted to provide insight into the individual psychological dimensions of political terrorism.Crenshaw Diana Oughton is one of the individuals he uses as a case study.

Carl Jung also included in this definition the overlap and tension between the personal and the collective elements in man. Psychology is the scientific or objective study of the psyche. The word has a long history of use in psychology and philosophy, dating back to ancient times, and represents one of the fundamental concepts for understanding human nature from a scientific point of view. The English word soul is sometimes used synonymously, especially in older texts. Etymology The basic meaning of the Greek word œàœÖœáŒÆ (psyche) was \\"life\\", although unsupported,Henry George Liddell and Ridley Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon entry \\"psyche\\". some have claimed it is derived from the verb œàœçœáœâ (psycho, \\"to blow\\"). Derived meanings included \\"spirit\\", \\"soul\\", \\"ghost\\", and ultimately \\"self\\" in the sense of \\"conscious personality\\" or \\"psyche\\".See p.187-197, 204 of . Ancient psychology The idea of the psyche is central to the philosophy of Plato. Scholars translate the Platonic conceptualization of the term as \\"soul\\" in the sense that he believed that it is immortal. In his Phaedo, Plato has Socrates give four arguments for the immortality of the soul and life after death following the separation of the soul from the body.Plato, Phaedo 69e-84b. Plato's Socrates also states that after death the Psyche is better able to achieve wisdom and experience the Platonic forms since it is unhindered by the body.Plato, Phaedo 59c-69e The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote an influential treatise on the psyche, called in Greek (Peri Psyches), in Latin De Anima and in English On the Soul. In this work, he used the concept of the soul to explain certain functions. Since - for him - the soul is motion, it needs an explanatory principle for bodily motion. Aristotle's theory of the \\"three souls (psyches)\\" (vegetal, animal, and rational) would rule the field of psychology until the 19th century. Prior to Aristotle, a number of Greek writings used the term psyche in a less precise sense.Cf. Rohde, Psyche, Chapters I and VII. Also see the myth of Eros and Psyche, where Psyche was the embodiment of the soul. In late antiquity, Galenic medicine developed the idea of three \\"spirits\\" (pneuma) corresponding to Aristotle's three souls. The pneuma psychikon corresponded to the rational soul. The other two pneuma were the pneuma physicon and the pneuma zoticon. Medieval psychology The term psyche was Latinized to anima, which became one of the basic terms used in medieval psychology. Anima would have traditionally been rendered in English as \\"soul\\" but in modern usage the term \\"psyche\\" is preferable.Simon Kemp, Medieval Psychology; Simon Kemp, Cognitive Psychology in the Middle Ages; Anthony Kenny Aquinas on Mind. Phenomenology 19th century psychologists such as Franz Brentano developed the concept of the psyche in a more subjective direction. Psychoanalysis In psychoanalysis and other forms of depth psychology, the psyche refers to the forces in an individual that influence thought, behavior and personality.Cf. Reed, Edward S., 1998, on the narrowing of the study of the psyche into the study of the mind. Especially Preface, page xv. =Freudian school= Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, believed that the psyche‚Äîhe used the word Seele ('soul', but also 'psyche') throughout his writings‚Äîwas composed of three components: * The id, which represents the instinctual drives of an individual and remains largely unconscious.It does not respect the rules of society. * The super-ego, which represents a person's conscience and their internalization of societal norms and morality. * The ego, which is conscious and serves to integrate the drives of the id with the prohibitions of the super-ego. Freud believed this conflict to be at the heart of neurosis. Freud's original terms for the three components of the psyche, in German, were das Es (lit. the 'It'), das Ich (lit. the 'I'), and das √úber-Ich (lit. the 'Over-I' or 'Upper-I'). According to Bruno Bettelheim, the Latin terms were proposed by Freud's English translators, probably to make them seem more 'medical' since, at the time, Latin was prevalent in medical terminology. Bettelheim deplores what he sees as pseudoscientific, Latin terms.Freud and Man's Soul, Vintage Books, 1984, pp.52-62. =Jungian school = Carl Jung wrote much of his work in German. Jung was careful to define what he meant by psyche and by soul (Seele). > I have been compelled, in my investigations into the structure of the > unconscious, to make a conceptual distinction between soul and psyche. By > psyche, I understand the totality of all psychic processes, conscious as > well as unconscious. By soul, on the other hand, I understand a clearly > demarcated functional complex that can best be described as a \\"personality\\". > (Jung, 1971: Def. 48 par. 797) > [In previous translations, and in this one as well, psyche‚Äîfor which Jung in > the German original uses either Psyche or Seele‚Äîhas been used with reference > to the totality of all psychic processes (cf. Jung, Psychological Types, > Def. 48); i.e., it is a comprehensive term. Soul, on the other hand, as used > in the technical terminology of analytical psychology, is more restricted in > meaning and refers to a \\"function complex\\" or partial personality and never > to the whole psyche. It is often applied specifically to \\"anima\\" and > \\"animus\\"; e.g., in this connection it is used in the composite word \\"soul- > image\\" (Seelenbild). This conception of the soul is more primitive than the > Christian one with which the reader is likely to be more familiar. In its > Christian context it refers to \\"the transcendental energy in man\\" and \\"the > spiritual part of man considered in its moral aspect or in relation to God.\\" > ... ‚Äî Editors.] (Jung, 1968: note 2 par. 9) Cognitive psychology The word \\"mind\\" is preferred by cognitive scientists to \\"psyche\\". The mind is a set of cognitive faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, language and memory. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness. It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.

He is the first name listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Life and career Buis was born and raised in Pender, Nebraska, the son of Dr. John Buis, a physician, and his wife Serena (n√©e Kundsen). He graduated from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri. He was part of the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) sent in 1955 to train South Vietnam troops. On July 8th, 1959 Major Dale R. Buis (visiting from MAAG 5) and M/Sgt Chester M. Ovnand (MAAG 7) were killed at Bien Hoa, northeast of Saigon. The Viet Cong attacked the mess hall where he and four other officers were watching the movie The Tattered Dress. M/Sgt Ovnand, who was in charge of the projector, switched on the lights to change to the next reel, when VC guerrillas poked their weapons through the windows and sprayed the room with automatic weapons fire. M/Sgt Ovnand was hit with several 9mm rounds. He immediately switched the lights off and headed to the top of the stairs, where he was able to turn on the exterior flood lights. He died from his wounds on the stairs. Major Buis, at that time, was crawling towards the kitchen doors. When the exterior flood lights came on, he must have seen an attacker coming through the kitchen doors. He got up and rushed towards attacker, but was only able to cover before being fatally hit from behind. His actions startled the attacker who was about to throw his satchel charge through the door. The attacker's satchel charge had already been activated and his moment of hesitation allowed the satchel charge to explode, killing him. Two South Vietnamese guards that were on duty that night were also killed by the Viet Cong. The wounded included Captain Howard Boston (MAAG 7) and the Vietnamese cook's eight-year-old son.

The station is located in Cincinnati and broadcasts from the WKRQ Tower. It airs an Adult-leaning Top 40 (CHR) format and is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. Its studios and transmitter are located just northeast of Downtown Cincinnati separately. History WKRQ signed on the air in 1947 as WCTS, which aired a classical music format. After WCTS was bought by Radio Cincinnati, Inc. (which became Taft Broadcasting in 1959), the station would change its call letters to WKRC-FM in 1950, while retaining the classical format. In 1970, WKRC-FM would become a Top 40 station as \\"Stereo 102\\", and was an automated Drake-Chenault station. In 1972, WKRC-FM became WKRQ, and became a live and local Top 40 station using \\"102 KRQ\\" as its primary identity and \\"Q102\\" and \\"the Q\\" as secondary monikers, with \\"Q102\\" being adopted as its primary moniker in 1975. With the exception of a brief switch to a brief AOR format between June and December 1973, WKRQ's CHR format has been in place since 1970, making Q102 one of the longest-running currently broadcasting Top 40 stations in the United States, despite its shift towards an adult top 40 format in the mid-1990s, leaving rival CHR/Top 40 WKFS to take the younger audience by default. The late 1970s sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati is often said to be based on either WKRQ or WKRC, with the final letter being the only difference. In reality, though, the show was based on creator Hugh Wilson's experience with WQXI in Atlanta. In 1980, 16-year-old Mary Buchanan won the first one-million-dollar prize ever awarded by any radio or TV station in the United States in a joint contest with sister station WKRC. The feat earned her and the station a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. Taft Broadcasting would be reorganized as Great American Broadcasting in 1987. However, the company would declare bankruptcy in 1993, and was reorganized as Citicasters, Inc. (their sister AM station would be sold to another locally- based company, Jacor). In 1996, Citicasters itself merged with Jacor; as part of the merger, WKRQ was sold to Boston-based American Radio Systems (ARS) on March 7, 1997 (this separated WKRQ from their long-time TV sister station).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1998/D-Radio-NE- Ter-BC-YB-1998.pdf However, in September 1997, Infinity Broadcasting (which was renamed CBS Radio in December 2005) would acquire ARS as part of a group deal; the merger was completed the following June.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1999/D-Radio-NE-Ter-BC- YB-1999..pdf CBS owned WKRQ until November 2006, when it was sold to Entercom. Entercom, in turn, announced in January 2007 that it would be swapping its entire Cincinnati cluster, including WKRQ, to Bonneville International together with three radio stations in Seattle, Washington, for all three of Bonneville's FM radio stations in San Francisco, California, and $1 million cash. In May 2007, the station launched an online stream from its website at www.wkrq.com.

They were emergency regulations passed on the outbreak of war and during it to give the government emergency powers to prosecute the war. Two Acts of Parliament were passed as enabling legislation to allow the Defence Regulations to be promulgated. The first was the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, which was passed immediately before war was declared, and the second was the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1940, which was passed in the aftermath of the German attack on France in 1940. The 1940 Act allowed Defence Regulations to be made on matters such as industrial conscription. The main Defence Regulations were the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, which were amended at various points throughout the war. Other Defence Regulations covered narrower fields of life. These included Defence Regulation 18B, which provided a framework for internment. The Defence Regulations were Orders in Council and could amend any primary or secondary legislation within the limits of the enabling Acts to allow the effective prosecution of the war. Since the emergency conditions created by the war persisted after the conflict was over, the last of the Defence Regulations, mainly those on food rationing, were not abolished until the early 1950s. Death penalty Originally the regulations did not create any capital offences, since the law of treason was thought to be sufficient. Defence Regulation 2A provided that \\"If, with intent to assist the enemy, any person does any act which is likely to assist the enemy or to prejudice the public safety, the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war, he shall be liable to penal servitude for life.\\"Hansard However, in 1940 amendments to the regulations created two capital offences: \\"forcing safeguards\\" (breaking through roadblocks etc.) under regulation 1B, and looting under regulation 38A.Archbold, 31st ed. (1943) pp. 1524-1525 A third new capital offence, called treachery, was created soon afterwards by the Treachery Act 1940. Continuance and repeal After the end of the war, the Defence Regulations were continued in force by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act 1945,9&10 Geo. 6, c. 10 and later by the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act 1946.9&10 Geo. 6, c. 26 The last significant Regulations to be in force before the passage of the Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act 1959Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act, 1959, 7&8 Eliz. 2, c. 19, coming into force upon royal assent on 25 March 1959. were: * No. 55 (giving general power to control industry for wide purposes); * No. 55AA, (empowering the Government to secure the necessary information for these purposes); and * No. 55AB (giving power to impose price control of goods and services).

Life and career  Jack Moyer was born on 7 March 1929, in Kansas, United States. He made his first visit to Japan in 1951 with the United States Air Force, and made his first trip to Miyake-jima the following year. During his time in Japan, Moyer saw that the Air Force was using Onoharajima as a practice bombing range. Moyer wrote a letter to an associate of President Harry S. Truman to stop the bombing in order to save a rare seabird, the Japanese murrelet, that breeds on Onoharajima. The bombing was stopped. Moyer later moved to Miyake-jima in 1957 after graduating from Colgate University, and became a part of the island community for over 50 years.

Moyer  People  Trends in Japan  Web Japan Moyer was an ornithologist, marine biologist and naturalist who focused on the Izu islands and promoted the need for preservation of the islands' unique ecology. Having spent many years on Miyake-jima he was aware of the changes that came with modernization. Construction of public roads and harbors claimed increasing amounts of previously untouched mountain forest areas of the islands, and increasing car traffic and sea pollution were important concerns of his as well. During his time on Miyake-jima, Moyer organized a summer school for local children. In 1996, he was awarded the Asahi Shimbun prize for his work on ocean ecology and the education of young children. Later in life, Moyer split his time between Miyake-jima and Tokyo, where he taught a course entitled \\"Japan Lands And People\\" (JLAP) at the American School in Japan (ASIJ). Moyer was an extremely popular teacher at the school. A highlight of the JLAP course was the annual week-long trip to Miyake-jima for the 7th grade ASIJ class, where they would stay in Moyer's modest island home while studying local fisheries and farming. Moyer wrote several articles for the Japan Times on the marine biology of Japan. He was the author of several books, including Dolphin interpreter Introduction and Man of the sea and the birds . Along with the other residents of the island, Moyer was forced to flee the island following the eruptions of Mount Oyama in 2000. Later, he was asked by the Tokyo Metropolitan government to survey the island. He concluded that the island's ecology was recovering.  Death  Moyer died after he committed suicide at age 74 in his Tokyo home in 2004. Moyer left behind two suicide notes, and his body was discovered among a batch of unidentified sleeping pills.  Scandal  In March 2014, The American School in Japan admitted that several alumni had been sexually abused as middle school students by Moyer, while he was a teacher at the school. As many as 32 girls were victimized by Moyer, starting as early as 1964.Mitchell, John. \\"ASIJ admits honored teacher sexually abused students\\" (Archive). The Japan Times. March 20, 2014. Retrieved on May 28, 2014. In 2014, a legal firm representing 10 women who had allegedly been victims of Moyer's sent a demand letter to the ASIJ, claiming the school had been told repeatedly about Moyer's actions, but did nothing. In June, 2015, the ASIJ Board of Directors released a letter admitting that an independent investigation found that Jack Moyer's abuse of students was extensive and that the abuse was covered up by faculty and administrators for years. The board apologized for the harm this has caused and promised to release the report in English and Japanese by mid-June, 2015. The full report, released by Ropes & Gray LLP on June 15, 2015, concluded \\"[i]n light of all of the evidence we have examined, it is apparent to us that Moyer was a serial pedophile who, in our assessment, sexually abused female ASIJ students\\". Lawyers for 13 of the victims also released their report on June 15, 2015.

Lodin was originally approached by Elektra Records in 1987 to record a solo album, but Lodin opted to use the moniker Baltimoore rather than his own name. In 1992, Lodin relocated to √Öland, Finland, where he met Bulgarian-born guitarist Nikolo Kotzev. They joined forces for two Baltimoore albums, Double Density and Thought for Food. Due to personal and musical differences, Kotzev left the band in 1994 to start his own project, Brazen Abbot. Baltimoore was then on hiatus until 2000, when Lodin resurfaced with Original Sin. He would move back to Sweden the same year. In 2006, the band ended its relationship with Finnish record label Lion Music to start up their own label, BLP Music, on which their two latest albums, Kaleidoscope and X (both 2006), are released.

If one state becomes much stronger, the theory predicts it will take advantage of its weaker neighbors, thereby driving them to unite in a defensive coalition. Some realists maintain that a balance-of-power system is more stable than one with a dominant state, as aggression is unprofitable when there is equilibrium of power between rival coalitions. When threatened, states may seek safety either by balancing, allying with others against the prevailing threat; or bandwagoning, aligning themselves with the threatening power. Other alliance tactics include buck-passing and chain- ganging. Realists have long debated how the polarity of a system impacts the choice of tactics; however, it is generally agreed that in bipolar systems, each great power has no choice but to directly confront the other. Along with debates between realists about the prevalence of balancing in alliance patterns, other schools of international relations, such as constructivists, are also critical of the balance of power theory, disputing core realist assumptions regarding the international system and the behavior of states.  History  The principle involved in preserving the balance of power as a conscious goal of foreign policy, as David Hume pointed out in his Essay on the Balance of Power, is as old as history, and was used by Greeks such as Thucydides both as political theorists and as practical statesmen. A 2018 study in International Studies Quarterly confirmed that \\"the speeches of the Corinthians from prior to the Persian Wars to the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War reveal an enduring thesis of their foreign policy: that imperial ambitions and leveling tendencies, such as those of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, should be countered in order to prevent a tyrant city from emerging within the society of Greek city-states.\\" It resurfaced among the Renaissance Italian city-states in the 15th century. Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, and Lorenzo de' Medici, ruler of Florence, were the first rulers actively to pursue such a policy, with the Italic League, though historians have generally attributed the innovation to the Medici rulers of Florence. Discussion of Florence's policy can be found in De Bello Italico, by Bernardo Rucellai, a Medici son-in-law. This was a history of the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII of France, and introduced the phrase balance of power to historical analysis. Universalism, which was the dominant direction of European international relations prior to the Peace of Westphalia, gave way to the doctrine of the balance of power. The term gained significance after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, where it was specifically mentioned. (Georg Schwarzenberger, Power Politics, London: Jonathan Cape, 1941, p. 120) It was not until the beginning of the 17th century, when Grotius and his successors established the science of international law, that the balance of power was formulated as a fundamental principle of diplomacy. In accordance with this new discipline, the European states formed a sort of federal community, the fundamental condition of which was the preservation of a balance of power, i.e., such a disposition of things that no one state, or potentate, should be able absolutely to predominate and prescribe laws to the rest. And, since all were equally interested in this settlement, it was held to be the interest, the right, and the duty of every power to interfere, even by force of arms, when any of the conditions of this settlement were infringed upon, or assailed by, any other member of the community. cites Emerich de Vattel, Le Droit des gens (Leiden, 1758) This balance-of-power principle, once formulated, became an axiom of political science. F√©nelon, in his Instructions, impressed the axiom upon the young French Dauphin. Frederick the Great, in his Anti- Machiavel, proclaimed the principle to the world. In 1806 Friedrich von Gentz re-stated it with admirable clarity, in Fragments on the Balance of Power. The principle formed the basis of the coalitions against Louis XIV and Napoleon, and the occasion (or excuse) for most of the European wars between the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Congress of Vienna (1814). It was especially championed by Great Britain, even up to World War I, as it sought to prevent a European land power from rivaling its naval supremacy. During the greater part of the 19th century, the series of national upheavals which remodeled the map of Europe obscured the balance of power. Yet, it underlaid all the efforts of diplomacy to tame the forces of nationalism let loose by the French Revolution. In the revolution's aftermath, with the restoration of comparative calm, the principle once more emerged as the operative motive for the various political alliances, of which the ostensible object was the preservation of peace. Regarding the era 1848‚Äì1914, English diplomatic historian A.J.P. Taylor argued: :Europe has known almost as much peace as war; and it has owed these periods of peace to the Balance of Power. No one state has ever been strong enough to eat up all the rest, and the mutual jealousy of the Great Powers has preserved even the small states, which could not have preserved themselves.A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe (1954) p xix Regarding the last quarter-century of the period outlined by Taylor, his American colleague, diplomatic historian Edward Mead Earle, argued: \\"During the quarter-century beginning about 1890, Europe and the Far East lived under a precarious balance of power with the result ‚Ä¶ that the world moved crazily from one crisis to another and finally to catastrophe\\". Earle concludes: \\"The balance of power may well land us all in crematory\\".Edward Mead Earle, \\"Power Politics and American World Policy\\", Review of Nicholas J. Spykman‚Äôs America's Strategy in World Politics,\\" Political Science Quarterly, 58/1, (1943): p 102, 103‚Äì104. The balance of power theory prepared catastrophe in 1939 as in 1914, wrote Clarence Streit in his famous Union Now. There is \\"no more sterile, illusory, fantastic, exploded and explosive peace policy than the balance of power.\\"Clarence Streit, Union Now: The Proposal for Inter-Democracy Federal Union, (London & New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1940), p 22. Since 1945, the arguments of Streit and Earle has prevailed over that of Taylor. Atomic scientists launched an all-out attack on the balance-of-power concept: Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer interpreted the core of the concept of Europe after 1945 as the rejection of the European balance-of-power principle and the hegemonic ambitions of individual states that had emerged following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648: \\"European integration was the response to centuries of a precarious balance of powers on this continent which again and again resulted in terrible hegemonic wars and culminated in the two World Wars between 1914 and 1945.\\"Joschka Fischer, \\"From Confederacy to Federation: Thoughts on the Finality of European Integration\\", (Berlin: Speech at the Humboldt University, 12 May 2000), http://ec.europa.eu/dorie/fileDownload.do?docId=192161&cardId;=192161 Former US Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney expressed the same for Europe and other democracies: \\"It is not in our interest or those of the other democracies to return to earlier periods in which multiple military powers balanced one against another in what passed for security structures, while regional, or even global peace hung in the balance.\\"Dick Cheney, \\"Defense Strategy for the 1990s: The Regional Defense Strategy\\", (January 1993, Washington DC: Department of Defense, http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/naarpr_Defense.pdf ), p 8. NATO Secretary General, Manfred W√∂rner, outlined the European alternative at the end of the Cold War: =England= It has been argued by historians that, in the sixteenth century, England came to pursue a foreign policy which would preserve the equilibrium between Spain and France, which evolved into a balance-of-power policy: In 1579 the first English translation of Francesco Guicciardini's Storia d'Italia (\\"History of Italy\\") popularised Italian balance of power theory in England. This translation was dedicated to Elizabeth I of England and claimed that \\"God has put into your hand the balance of power and justice, to poise and counterpoise at your will the actions and counsels of all the Christian kings of your time\\". Thomas Carlyle referred to statesmen \\"in shadow-hunting, shadow-hunted hour ... looking with intense anxiety into a certain spectral something the call the Balance of Power.\\"History of Friedrich II of Prussia (edition 1888) II:85 Statesman Richard Cobden labeled balance of power \\"a chimera\\" due to its unclear meaning: \\"It is not a fallacy, a mistake, an imposture‚Äîit is an undescribed, indescribable, incomprehensible nothing.\\" The only point on which writers on the balance of power agree \\"is in the fundamental delusion that such a system was ever acceded to by the nations of Europe.\\" They imply long, uninterrupted, peaceful and prosperous co-existence. Instead, for centuries \\"Europe has (with only just sufficient intervals to enable the combatants to recruit their wasted energies) been one vast and continued battle-field‚Ä¶\\"Richard Cobden, \\"The Balance of Power,\\" 1836, (Theory and Practice of the Balance of Power, 1486‚Äì1914: Selected European Writings, ed. Moorhead Wright, London: Rowman & Littlefield, 1975), p 110-112. He criticized Lord Bacon for his adherence to the balance of power as a universal rule: Sir Esme Howard wrote that England adopted the balance of power as \\"a cornerstone of English policy, unconsciously during the sixteenth, subconsciously during the seventeenth, and consciously during the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, because for England it represented the only plan of preserving her own independence, political and economic\\". With the coming of World War II, however, Edward Carr found that today the balance of power badly preserves the independence of England: In 1941, Winston Churchill was criticized by his rival, Adolf Hitler, for his adherence to the balance of power: On another occasion he added: Without the Wehrmacht, a \\"wave would have swept over Europe that would have taken no care of the ridiculous British idea of the balance of power in Europe in all its banality and stupid tradition‚Äîonce and for all.\\" In fact, Churchill shortly adopted a similar view: Our Russian friends and Allies, he spoke in 1946, most admire strength and least respect military weakness. \\"For that reason the old doctrine of a balance of power is unsound. We cannot afford ‚Ä¶ to work on narrow margins, offering temptations to a trial of strength.\\" If the Western Democracies do not stand together \\"then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all.\\" If, however, \\"the population of the English-speaking Commonwealths be added to that of the United States with all that such co- operation implies in the air, on the sea, all over the globe and in science and in industry, and in moral force, there will be no quivering, precarious balance of power to offer its temptation to ambition or adventure. On the contrary, there will be an overwhelming assurance of security.\\"\\"The Senews of Peace,\\" speech at Westminster College, Fulton, Missouri, 5 March 1946, NATO/OTAN Online Library, http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1946/s460305a_e.htm =Historical evidence against the balance of power theory and implications= In an attempt to disprove the balance of power theory, some realists have pointed to cases in international systems other than modern Europe where balancing failed and a hegemon arose. William Wohlforth, Richard Little and Stuart Kaufman, point to the failure of state like units to balance against Assyria in the first millennium BCE; the Hellenic successor states of Alexander the Great to balance against Rome; the Warring States to balance against the Qin dynasty in ancient China and five other cases. This cross- cultural research concludes: Wohlforth, Little and Kaufman state that systemic hegemony is likely under two historically common conditions: First when the rising hegemon develops the ability to incorporate and effectively administer conquered territories. And second, when the boundaries of the international system remain stable, and no new major powers emerge from outside the system. When the leading power can administer conquests effectively so they add to its power and when the system's borders are rigid, the probability of hegemony is high. The argument of universal reproduction of anarchy can be correct in the European context, \\"whereas a systematic survey of world history reveals that multipolarity has frequently given way to unipolarity or hegemony.\\"Richard Little, The Balance of Power in International Relations: Metaphors, Myths, and Models, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p 268. Henry Kissinger, Historian by profession, noted that \\"theories of the balance of power often leave the impression that it is the natural form of international relations. In fact, balance-of-power systems have existed only rarely in history.\\" Yet based on these rare occurrences, many realists \\"elevate a fact of life ‚Ä¶ into a guiding principle of world order.\\"Diplomacy, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994) p 21-22. Earlier, political scientist Martin Wight had drawn a conclusion with unambiguous implication for the modern world: Still earlier, Quincy Wright, concluded on the balance of power in world history: Evoking examples of the ancient Chinese and Roman civilizations, Quincy Wright added: The post-Cold War period represents an anomaly to the balance of power theory too. Rousseau defined the theoretical limit how far balance of power can be altered: \\"Will it be supposed that two or three potentates might enter into an agreement to subdue the rest? Be it so. These three potentates, whoever they may be, will not possess half the power of all Europe.\\"Rousseau, \\"Abstract of the Abbe de Saint-Pierres Project for the Perpetual Peace,\\" (1761), in Theory and Practice of the Balance of power, 1486‚Äì1914: Selected European Writings, (ed.

Wohlforth, Little and Kaufman undertook the above-mentioned historical study after they had coped with what they called the \\"puzzle\\" of the unipolar stability. Elsewhere, Richard Little wrote: Events since the end of the Cold War \\"create a potential anomaly\\" for the theory because the outcome has \\"left the United States as the sole superpower in a unipolar world ...

In order to do so, he discusses the dynamics of balance of power theory, assumed to be inoperative in the post-Cold War period by main academic debates over unipolarity: i) unipolar stability; ii) balance of threats; iii) soft balancing; iv) liberal institutionalism. He then argues that these approaches, including the unipolar illusion view, tied to the balance of power theory, overestimate the effects of unipolarity on balancing behavior of other states. Concluding that balance of power dynamics, especially those of hard balancing, are still observed in the post-Cold War era, he criticizes two main conclusions from the literature: i) that balancing became inoperative and; ii) that the only available strategies to other states are soft balancing and bandwagoning. In sum, this conclusion has directly implication on strategies available both to the United States and to its main competitors. Realism and balancing The many redrawn borders in Europe after the 1814‚Äì1815 Congress of Vienna represent a classic example of trying to achieve a European balance of power. The balance of power theory is a core tenet of both classical and neorealist theory and seeks to explain alliance formation. Due to the neorealist idea of anarchism as a result of the international system, states must ensure their survival through maintaining or increasing their power in a self-help world. With no authority above the state to come to its rescue in the event of an attack by a hegemon, states attempt to prevent a potential hegemon from arising by balancing against it. According to Kenneth Waltz, founder of neorealism, \\"balance-of-power politics prevail wherever two, and only two requirements are met: that the order be anarchic and that it be populated by units wishing to survive\\". They can do this either through \\"internal balancing\\" , where a state uses internal efforts such as moving to increase economic capability, developing clever strategies and increasing military strength, or through \\"external balancing\\", which occurs when states take external measures to increase their security by forming allies. States happy with their place in the system are known as \\"status quo\\" states, while those seeking to alter the balance of power in their favor are generally referred to as \\"revisionist states\\" and aspire for hegemony, thus repairing the balance. Balancing versus bandwagoning States choose to balance for two reasons. First, they place their survival at risk if they fail to curb a potential hegemon before it becomes too strong; to ally with the dominant power means placing one's trust in its continued benevolence. Secondly, joining the weaker side increases the likelihood that the new member will be influential within the alliance. States choose to bandwagon because it may be a form of appeasement as the bandwagoner may hope to avoid an attack by diverting it elsewhere‚Äîa defensive reason‚Äîor because it may align with the dominant side in wartime to share the spoils of victory‚Äîan offensive reason. Realists claim that balancing is when states ally against the prevailing threat and results in a more secure world whereas in a bandwagoning world security is scarce as rising hegemons are not kept in check. With bandwagoning, the threatened state abandons hope of preventing the aggressor from gaining power at its expense and instead joins forces with its dangerous foe to get at least some small portion of the spoils of war. The weaker the state the more likely it is to bandwagon than to balance as they do little to affect the outcome and thus must choose the winning side. Strong states may change a losing side into a winning side and thus are more likely to balance. States will be tempted to bandwagon when allies are unavailable, however excessive confidence in allied support encourages weak states to free ride relying on the efforts of others to provide security. Since bandwagoning \\"requires placing trust in the aggressors continued forbearance\\" some realists believe balancing is preferred to bandwagoning. According to Stephen Walt, states are more likely to balance in peacetime but if they are on the losing side of a war they may defect and bandwagon in the hopes that they will \\"share the fruits of victory\\". Chain ganging Chain-ganging occurs when a state sees its own security tied to the security of its alliance partner. It chains itself by deeming any attack on its ally the equivalent of an attack on itself. That is another aspect of the balance of power theory, whereby the smaller states could drag their chained states into wars that they have no desire to fight. A key example was the chain-ganging between states prior to World War I, dragging most of Europe to war over a dispute between the relatively major power of Austria-Hungary and the minor power of Serbia. Thus, states \\"may chain themselves unconditionally to reckless allies whose survival is seen to be indispensable to the maintenance of the balance\\". Buck passing and bloodletting Balancing and buck passing are the main strategies for preserving the balance of power and preventing a potential hegemon's rise. Instead of balancing against an aggressor, some states instead choose to \\"pass the buck\\" whereby instead of taking action to prevent a potential rise, it will pass the responsibility on to another state. John Mearsheimer, a prominent offensive realist, claims that threatened states can take four measures to facilitate buck passing, including: seeking good diplomatic relations with the aggressor in the hope that it will divert its attention to the \\"buck-catcher\\"; maintaining cool relations with the buck-catcher so as not to get dragged into the war with the buck-catcher and as a result possibly increase positive relations with the aggressor; increasing military strength to deter the aggressive state and help it focus on the buck-catcher; and facilitating the growth in power of the intended buck-catcher. In the case that a state is an enemy with both the aggressor and the intended buck- catcher, a buck-passer can implement a bait and bleed strategy whereby the state causes two rivals to engage in a protracted war while the baiter remains on the sideline. This form of buck passing enables the state to increase in relative strength at the expense of the two rivals. Bloodletting, a further variant whereby a state does what it can to increase the cost duration of the conflict can further increase the buck-passer's relative power. Thus, threatened states usually prefer buck-passing to balancing as the buck-passer avoids the costs of fighting the aggressor in the event of war. Some realists believe there is a strong tendency to buck-pass or free-ride within balancing coalitions themselves, usually leaving their alliance partners to assume the heavy burden of wearing down the enemy, leaving the free-riders military fresh to win the final battles of the war and thus be in a better position to dictate the peace, such as the UK's light involvement in the early stages of World War I. Likewise, buck-passers can enter wars late after both sides have been worn down, allowing the buck-passer to dominate the post-war world. A potential drawback of the strategy occurs if the buck-catcher fails to check the aggressor, as the buck-passer will be in a much more vulnerable situation. Proponents of the theory point to the Soviet Union's role in World War II whereby it passed the buck to the UK and France through the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany. After eliminating France the Germans had no Western front to divide their forces, allowing them to concentrate their forces against the USSR. Offensive and defensive realism =Defensive realism= Defensive realists emphasize that if any state becomes too powerful, balancing will occur as other powers would build up their forces and form a balancing coalition. Because this resulting security dilemma would leave the aspiring hegemon less secure, defensive realists maintain that it is in a state's interest to maintain the status quo rather than maximize its power. =Offensive realism= Offensive realists accept that threatened states usually balance against dangerous foes, however, they maintain that balancing is often inefficient and that this inefficiency provides opportunities for a clever aggressor to take advantage of its adversaries. Buck passing, rather than joining a balancing coalition, is another tactic offensive realists point to when disputing the balance of power theory. Offensive realists believe that internal balancing measures such as increasing defense spending, implementing conscription, are only effective to a certain extent as there are usually significant limits on how many additional resources a threatened state can muster against an aggressor. However, since offensive realists theorize that states are always seeking to maximize their power, states are \\"effectively engaged in internal balancing all the time\\". Balance of threat The balance of threat theory is an offshoot of the balancing, coined in 1985 by Stephen M. Walt in an attempt to explain why balancing against rising hegemons has not always been consistent in history. In contrast to traditional balance of power theorists, Walt suggests that states balance against threats, rather than against power alone. The \\"balance-of-power theory is not wrong; it is merely incomplete. Power is one of the factors that affect the propensity to balance, although it is not the only one nor always the most important.\\"Stephen Walt, \\"Keeping the World 'Off Balance:‚Äô Self Restraint and US Foreign Policy,\\" (ed. John Ikenberry, Ithaka & London: Cornell University Press, 2002), p 134. The theory acknowledges that power is an extremely important factor in the level of threat posed by a state, but also includes geographic proximity, offensive capabilities, and perceived intentions.  Soft balancing  Soft balancing was developed in the 2000s to cope with the current anomaly of the unipolar unbalanced world. Thomas Mowle and David Sacko describe \\"soft balancing\\" as \\"balancing that does not balance at all.\\" These theoretical efforts are counter-productive, since Realism and unipolarity are compatible and structural realism should rather develop a set of hypotheses for a unipolar world: \\"Scholars do not need to desperately search for signs of balancing, they do not need to soften balancing beyond recognition, and they do not need to stand to watch for the first glimmering of a new multipolar dawn.\\"The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future, (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), p 147, 158. Campbell Craig explained the development of soft balancing theory on the Thomas Kuhn's three-stage model how scholarly communities respond to anomalies that seem clearly to defy their core theoretical predictions: Significance It is the net effect, or result, produced by a state system in which the independent state as sovereign members are free to join or to refrain from joining alliances and alignments as each seeks to maximize its security and to advance its national interest. Preponderance of power The preponderance of power has been suggested as an alternative to the balance of power since World War II. In his 1940 article, \\"War, Peace and the Balance of Power\\", Frederick L. Schuman included a chapter titled \\"Necessity for Preponderance of Power\\". It argued: In 1941, Alfred Vagts wrote an article, titled \\"The United States and the Balance of Power,\\" in which he recalled the words of Thomas Jefferson: In 1942, Robert Strausz-Hup√© found that it \\"is in the interests of the United States no less than that of humanity\\" that the United States should be the only one \\"geographical power nucleus\\" from which a \\"balancing and stabilizing\\" power of arbiter be exercised. This \\"will pave the way for a new and universal order.\\"Robert Strausz-Hup√©, Geopolitics: The Struggle for Space and Power, (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1942), p 194-195. Writing the same year in Life magazine, Joseph Thorndike tells about \\"many observers\\" seeking \\"preponderant power in the postwar world\\" to replace balance of power: However, Thorndike added in the same 1942 article, many may wonder whether, over the years, Russia and China \\"will not rival Anglo- America\\". The following year, the founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, also invoked the example of the two-centuries-long \\"Pax Romana\\" which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power and inter-regional organization: The same year, Nathaniel Peffer criticized the idea of the preponderance of power: In self- contradiction, Peffer ended the article recommending for the postwar period a preponderance of power of offensive kind backed by total national effort: The United States will need \\"a larger permanent military establishment,\\" alliances with other powers having common interests and an alliance with Great Britain that would be not only defensive but also \\"outright, unconditional offensive.\\" It means full-scale power politics and to it \\"must be accommodated and sometimes subordinated everything else in the nation‚Äôs life.\\"\\"America‚Äôs Place in the Postwar World,\\" p 23-24. On 24 September 1946, Truman's Special Counsel Clark M. Clifford submitted a report \\"American Relations with the Soviet Union‚Ä¶\\" advocating a preponderant power: In the early Cold War, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson combined the concepts of preponderance and bandwagoning. As he put it, the United States was going to have to be \\"the locomotive at the head of mankind,\\" while the rest of the world was going to be \\"the caboose.\\"Cited in While arguing that equilibrium was essential to justice, Reinhold Niebuhr asserted that \\"nothing but the preponderance of power in the non-Communist world can preserve the peace.\\"Cited in Inis L. Claude, \\"The Balance of Power Revisited,\\" Review of International Studies, 15/2, (1989): p 79. Melvyn Leffler describes the US strategy throughout the Cold War as a strategy of preponderance. In its last year, he summarized: Backed by strategic preponderance, the United States integrated and rearmed the Eurasian industrial areas, shored up the Eurasian periphery and rolled back the Iron Curtain.A Preponderance of Power: National Security, the Truman Administration, and the Cold War, (Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1992), p 517. Already during the Cold War, some scholars stressed that the pattern accords the preponderance of power rather than balance of power. The balance of power presupposes such a distribution of power in the system that no single state is preponderant. In this sense, during the period 1945‚Äì1965 if \\"there was any threat to the general balance of power [...] it was from the United States rather than from the Soviet Union that this came.\\"Hedley Bull, \\"The Great Irresponsibilities? The United States, the Soviet Union, and World Order\\", International Journal, 35, (1979/80): p 440. Stephen Walt observed in the 1980s that most states, including all developed states, ally with, rather than balance against, the preponderant power. Noting this \\"anomaly\\", Walt suggested his balance of threat hypothesis: In 1986, still not envisaging the end of the Cold War in sight, Zbigniew Brzezinski emphasized the historical uniqueness of the current period regarding the preponderance of power: \\"[N]ever before would the eclipse of one of the major rival powers have given to the other effective global preponderance.\\"Game Plan: A Geostrategic Framework for the Conduct of the US-Soviet Contest, (Boston & New York: The Atlantic Monthly Press, 1986), p 27. Shortly after one of the rival superpowers eclipsed, the Pentagon Regional Defense Strategy (1992) formulized: \\"It is not in our interest ‚Ä¶ to return to earlier periods in which multiple military powers balanced one against another in what passed for security structures, while regional or even global peace hang in the balance.\\"Cited in Christopher Layne, \\"US Hegemony and the Perpetuation of NATO,\\" Journal of Strategic Studies, 23/3, (2000): p 87. In the first post- Cold War year, Leffler advocated for the United States to continue its strategy of \\"preponderance of power\\".A Preponderance of Power, p 518. Christopher Layne claims that the preponderance of power has been the dominant US strategy during both the Cold War and the post-Cold War periods. \\"Preponderance's strategic imperatives are the same as they were during the post-World War II era: pacification and reassurance in Europe and East Asia, and protection of these regions from instability in the periphery.\\"\\"From Preponderance to Offshore Balancing; America's Future Grand Strategy\\", International Security, 22/1, (1997): p 92.Also The Peace of Illusions: American Grand Strategy from 1940 to the Present, (Ithaka & London: Cornell University Press, 2006). The post-Cold War strategy of preponderance holds that \\"only a preponderance of US power ensures peace\\" which is \\"the result of an imbalance of power in which US capabilities are sufficient, operating on their own, to cow all potential challengers and to comfort all coalition partners. It is not enough consequently to be primus inter pares [...] One must be primus solus.\\"Barry Posen & Andrew L. Ross, \\"Competing Visions for US Grand Strategy\\", International Security, 21/3, (1996/7): 32. Layne since the beginning of the post-Cold war period expects the preponderance of power to trigger counterbalancing. He finds that \\"it was the bipolar structure of the postwar system that allowed Washington to pursue a strategy of preponderance successfully\\" and thereby smother the emergence of other great powers. But the preponderance of power which \\"others found merely irritating in a bipolar world may seem quite threatening in a unipolar world.\\"\\"The Unipolar Illusion: Why New Great Powers Will Rise?\\" International Security, 17/4, (1993): p 34-35. Because of these structural factors, \\"an American strategy of preponderance [...] is doomed to failure\\"; it will \\"cause other states to balance against the United States\\".\\"The Unipolar Illusion\\", p 51. Overturning the scholarly conventional wisdom, however, the current preponderant power seems to render inoperative the counterbalancing long central to research in international relations.Stephen G. Brooks &, William C. Wohlforth, World Out of Balance: International Relations and the Challenge of American Primacy, Princeton & Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2008), p 3. By the preponderance of American power and the absence of balance of power William Wohlforth explains the peacefulness and stability of the present world order.\\"US Strategy in a Unipolar World\\", America Unrivaled: The Future of the Balance of Power, (ed. John Ikenberry, Ithaka & London: Cornell University Press, 2002), p 14. No distribution of power rules out war. \\"The greater the preponderance of power, however, the more extreme the values of other variables must be to produce war [...]\\"\\"The Stability of a Unipolar World\\", International Security, 24/1, (1999), p 25. Campbell Craig believes that \\"Power Preponderance theory\\" will become one of the dominant American IR schools of the post-Cold War era: Expecting anti-American balancing, Waltz drew a much-cited analogy: \\"As nature abhors vacuum, so international politics abhors unbalanced power.\\"\\"Structural Realism after the Cold War,\\" International Security, 25/1, (2000): p 28. Craig paraphrased: US National Security Strategy of 2002 uses repeatedly the term 'balance of power' favoring freedom. The author of the Preponderance of Power‚Ä¶ (1992), Melvyn Leffler, was puzzled: A balance of power is linked historically to the evolution of the Westphalian state system and \\"envisions equilibrium, while the Bush administration yearns for hegemony.\\" When they invoke the language of power balancing, Bush's advisers obfuscate more than they clarify: According to Leffler's exegesis, Bush has invoked a balance of power vocabulary in purpose to integrate the tradition with the hegemonic dilemma.\\"9/11 and the Past and Future of American Foreign Policy,\\" p 1061, 1063. British Orwell Prize-winning policy analyst, Anatol Lieven, comments: In this conception, however, a phrase \\"was a form of Orwellian doublespeak. The clear intention actually was to be so strong that other countries had no choice but to rally to the side of the United States, concentrating all real power and freedom of action in the hands of America.\\"\\"America Right or Wrong: An Anatomy of American Nationalism,\\" The Geopolitics Reader, (eds. Gearoid O‚ÄôTauthail, & Simon Dalby, London & New York: Routledge, 2004, p 172. The surprising rehabilitation of the balance-of- power term in the 2002 NSS \\"can be accounted for in terms of mythopoetic function that the terminology serves in the document.\\" It keeps alive the traditional concept in a new unipolar world.Richard Little, The Balance of Power in International Relations: Metaphors, Myths, and Models, (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p 82, 84. Eventually, explanation what implies \\"the balance of power favoring freedom\\" was dropped by \\"US National Security and Defense Strategies\\" of 2018: The Pentagon will ensure that the United States remain the \\"preeminent military power in the world,\\" and the regional \\"balances of power remain in our favor.\\" [Emphasis added] The \\"balance of power favoring freedom\\" appeared identical with the balance of power favoring \\"us.\\" Russian President Vladimir Putin complained: \\"Instead of establishing a new balance of power ‚Ä¶ they [the United States] took steps that threw the [international] system into sharp and deep imbalance.\\" In 1826, George Canning \\"called the new world into existence to redress the balance of the old\\". In 1898, Theodore Roosevelt found that the United States had become \\"more and more the balance of power of the whole globe.\\" In 1941, a New Deal Economist with the National Resources Planning Board, Otto T.

His BOP-theory says that (smaller, weaker) states will balance the power or preponderance of more powerful ones to ensure that the latter do not become too powerful and dominate all other. For Waltz, a bipolar structure, as given in the Cold War, seems to be the best, i.e. the most peaceful one. Most relevant for his theory are Chapters 1 and 4‚Äì6. *Walt, S. (1987). The Origins of Alliances. Walt puts the BOP-theory on a new basis and calls it balance-of-threat (BOT) theory, since some states do not balance each other, because they do not perceive one another as threats (e.g. the West in the Cold War, worked together against the Warsaw Pact, but didn't balance each other). *Mearsheimer, J. J. (2001). The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. New York: W. W. Norton. Mearsheimer tries to mend BOP theory after it was unable to predict or explain the end of the Cold War. He describes himself as an \\"offensive realist\\" and believes that states do not simply balance, but because they want to survive in an anarchical system they get frequently aggressive. This is in contrast to Waltz, whom he describes as \\"defensive realist\\", who says that states primarily seek survival through balancing. Mearsheimer is an ardent critic of other IR theories (such as neoliberalism, constructivism etc.) and warns heavily of the Chinese rise in their relative power position. *T. V.

Early in his career, he emphasized that not all alcohol problems are severe and tested briefer interventions for mid-range problem drinkers. His meta-analysis of the research on treatments of alcohol problems shows a rank ordering of those treatments with the most effective being active and empathic (brief interventions and motivational enhancement), while the least effective are passive (films, lectures) or confrontational.Hester, R. K. & Miller, W. R., eds. Handbook of Alcoholism treatment Approaches: Effective Alternatives 3rd ed.Allyn & Bacon, 2003 He also demonstrated through controlled experiment that confrontation leads to states of resistance and denial, which many in the addiction field attribute to traits of those with addiction. Motivational interviewing, or motivational enhancement therapy, avoids creating such resistance by avoiding confrontation and eliciting motivation with open-ended questions and empathy.

He was also viceroy of Sicily from 1668 to 1670. Early life Don Francisco Fern√°ndez de la Cueva was born in Barcelona into one of the most aristocratic families of Spain, as the eldest surviving son from the third marriage of his father, Francisco Fern√°ndez de la Cueva, 7th Duke of Alburquerque (1575‚Äì1637). His father was \\"one of the toughest, most rigorous, and successful of the viceroys of Catalonia...and had specialized in suppression of disorder.\\"Jonathan I. Israel, Race, Class, and Politics in Colonial Mexico, 1610-1670. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1975, p. 252. His father's first marriage to Do√±a Antonia, from the powerful House \\"de Toledo-Beaumont\\", was childless. He married again with Ana Mar√≠a de Padilla who deceased before 1614. Their only son, Beltran, died at age 17 in December 1617. In his 3rd marriage, the Duke married Ana Enr√≠quez de Cabrera y Colonna and had 9 children; his wife survived him some 21 years. Francisco, the eldest son, entered military service when very young. He served in the cavalry Jonathan I. Israel, Race, Class, and Politics in Colonial Mexico, 1610-1670. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1975, p. 253. in Flanders. Later, as general of cavalry, he fought in the defense of Tortosa and in the siege of Barcelona in 1650. One feature of his career would be also his Ambassadorial activities in the Germanic countries. Viceroy of New Spain He made his formal entry into Mexico City to take up the reins of government on August 15, 1653. He was accompanied by his wife, Juana de Armend√°riz, the daughter of Lope D√≠ez de Armend√°riz, a previous viceroy of New Spain. Because of the war with England, he feared an invasion of Spanish territories in the New World. Because of this he strengthened the defenses of Veracruz and San Juan de Ul√∫a on the east coast of New Spain. He also sent arms and munitions to Jamaica, Cuba and Florida. He increased trade with the Philippines, Siam and Cochinchina, sending mercury, saltpeter and other mineral products. He ordered the resumption of the minting of gold coins (suspended by Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza). He collected the royal rents with care, and sent back to Spain large quantities of silver. He reinforced the Armada de Barlovento, which guarded the coast and shipping. He ordered the construction in Campeche of new ships for the coastal and overseas trade. He also repaired the aqueduct supplying Mexico City with water. The viceroy accelerated the construction of the new cathedral of Mexico City, visiting it every afternoon, climbing the scaffolding, and giving monetary rewards to the workers. During a visit to the cathedral on 12 March 1660, a 19-year-old soldier in the viceroy's guard, Manuel Ledesma y Robles of Madrid, attacked the viceroy with a sword. The viceroy survived. Justice was swift for his attacker, who was quickly tried, then dragged around the city and back to the Plaza Mayor, where he was hanged the next day. The city of Alburquerque (now spelled Albuquerque), in what is now New Mexico, was founded on February 7, 1706 (not 1660) under his son's direction. He granted land to more than 100 Spanish families there. The writers of this period attributed to his government a strong encouragement for the development of the sciences and the arts. His palace was considered a model of elegance and good taste. Later life He left New Spain for Madrid in September, 1660. Thereafter he was named lieutenant general of marines. He also served as ambassador extraordinary to Vienna to accompany Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain, daughter of King Philip IV of Spain, when she married her uncle, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1668 Fern√°ndez de la Cueva was named viceroy of Sicily, where he remained two years. In 1674 the King appointed him as his Mayordomo mayor, chief of his Household. He died in March, 1676 in the Royal Palace of Madrid.  Marriage and children  Francisco Fern√°ndez de la Cueva married in 1645 Juana Francisca de D√≠ez de Aux Armend√°riz and had only 1 daughter. http://es.fundacionmedinaceli.org/casaducal/fichaindividuo.aspx?id=6846 This daughter, Ana de la Cueva y D√≠ez de Aux Armend√°riz (1647‚Äì1716), was married to her father's younger brother Melchor, thus making him 9th Duke of Alburquerque after Francisco's death.

It is a thick mixture of 13 vegetables commonly found in the western ghats and coconut, seasoned with coconut oil and curry leaves. Avial is considered an essential part of the Main meal (Oonu in Malayalam Central Travancore has a slightly different variety of avial with its thin gravy whereas the classical avial is thick. Ingredients Generally, only crisp vegetables are used in avial. Vegetables commonly used in avial are elephant yam, plantain, ash pumpkin, carrots, beans, egg plants, cucumber, drum stick pods, snake gourd and Broad Bean, etc. are the recent introduction, while the north Kerala Avial includes bitter gourd also and in the Kollam region of Kerala tomato is added among other vegetables. Some people prefer to skip curd or substitute it with raw mango or tamarind pulp. This dish can be made into a gravy or be made into a semi-solid side dish. It is generally eaten with rice. The word \\"avial\\" is also used to denote 'boiled' or 'cooked in water' ‚Äî this sense being derived from the way the dish is made. Mythology It is believed to have been invented by Bhima during their exile. According to the legend, when Ballava (Bhima's name during this time) assumed his duties as the cook in the kitchen of Virata, he did not know how to cook. One of the first things he did was to chop up many different vegetables, boil them together and top the dish with grated coconut. There are mythological variations. Bheema is said to have prepared Avial, when there were unexpected guests for King Virata and he needed to serve meals for them. There were no sufficient vegetables to cook any single recipe for a side dish, so Bheema used whatever available vegetables to make a new dish, which came to be known as Avial. Another narrative version relates to the attempt made by Kauravas to kill Bhima. After poisoning Bhima, Kauravas tied Bhima and threw him to water. Kauravas also communicated that they saw Bhima drowning in water. With the completion of the days of mourning, a funeral feast was planned and preparation were underway. Unexpectedly, Bhima emerged from the water, rescued by the Nagas. With this, preparations for the feast was cancelled. However, Bhima was unhappy with this decision, and decided to mix all of the vegetables to prepare a new dish, that later became popular as Avial. Another myth that in the kingdom of Travancore in Kerala there was a great fest held by the king. Every one in the kingdom came to eat so there was a shortage of curry to be served. But in the kitchen also stocks were less so when the king visited the kitchen he found that a lot of vegetables were wasted when they were peeled. The king ordered the cook to make a curry with this along with some other ingredients so Avial was born. The king also ordered it to be served as the first item. Hence Avial is the first to be served on a Sadhya.

It runs for north and south through the eastern part of the county, connecting U.S. Highway 287 near the Oklahoma-Texas state line to US-56 in Keyes. The only other highway it intersects with is US-64/412/SH-3, three miles (5 km) south of Keyes. SH-171 has no lettered spur routes. SH-171 was established circa 1974 with its present-day routing and termini, and may have initially been numbered SH-170. It had assumed its current number by 1976. Route description State Highway 171 begins at US-287 near Kerrick, Texas, northwest of the Texas state line. From the southern terminus, SH-171 heads due north. Approximately north of the terminus, SH-171 crosses the intermittent Beaver River (a local name for the North Canadian River). As the route continues north, it passes to the east of two intermittent lakes, Ritner Lake and Sampsel Lake. The highway then comes to a junction with US-64, US-412, and SH-3; the three highways head toward Boise City to the west and Guymon to the east. SH-171 continues north, passing along the eastern edge of the town of Keyes. The route then comes to an end at US-56. History The route of the present-day SH-171 was first shown as a state highway on the 1975 official state map, implying its creation in 1974. On this edition of the map only, it is shown as State Highway 170. By 1976, it was shown as SH-171. The route has always been paved, and follows the same routing that it did in 1974.

She was a member of the Rothschild banking family of France. Early life, marriages, family The daughter of the wealthy and influential banker √âdouard Alphonse de Rothschild, and Germaine Alice Halphen, she was the sister of Guy de Rothschild and Bethsab√©e de Rothschild. She was born in Paris, France. De Rothschild was raised in the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res in the country in √éle-de-France, and at a home in the city in what is known as the \\"Talleyrand Building,\\" a mansion at 2 rue Saint- Florentin that today is part of the United States Embassy complex in Paris. According to her 1988 memoir Jump in the Waves, her parents were cold and distant and left her upbringing to an indifferent nanny. As a result, she grew into a timid, near-reclusive, young woman who at age 19 married publisher Robert Calmann-L√©vy (1899‚Äì1982), a distant relative. This marriage ended after five years in 1935, and two years later she married the renowned cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. Their daughter Jephta was born in France in 1937. Emigrates to U.S. The family had to flee France in the wake of the Nazi occupation during World War II. Piatigorsky and her husband settled in Elizabethtown, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains where their son Joram was born in 1940. They lived in Philadelphia for several years before moving to Los Angeles in 1949, where her husband taught at the University of Southern California. Chess successes As an American citizen, Piatigorsky was a chess player of note, and was competitive at the national level. Her passion for the game of chess led to a second career during which she trained seriously, with coach IM Herman Steiner. She represented the United States in the first Women's Chess Olympiad at Emmen 1957, where she scored 7.5/11 on second board and won a bronze medal. In the 1960s, she was the highest USCF- rated female chess player in California and was ranked #2 in the United States, competing successfully in several U.S. Women's Championships. Chess patron, organizer In addition to participating in the game, Piatigorsky became an important patron and tournament organizer. She sponsored the famous 1961 match between Samuel Reshevsky and Bobby Fischer, the top two American players. It was held jointly in New York City and Los Angeles, but was abandoned after 11 of the planned 16 games because of a scheduling dispute, with the score tied at 5.5 points apiece. In 1963 at the Ambassador Hotel she staged the first Piatigorsky Cup in which world champion Tigran Petrosian and Paul Keres tied for first place. The California Chess Reporter called it the greatest tournament held in the United States since the 1920s. In 1966, in Santa Monica, Boris Spassky won the second Piatigorsky Cup Tournament, with second place going to Bobby Fischer; this event had an even stronger field. She served as patron for many young California players, providing funds for travel to tournaments, and organized junior tournaments in the Los Angeles area. Sculptor, arts patron Piatigorsky was also a patron of the arts, and in 1985 created an endowment for the New England Conservatory of Music to provide the \\"New England Conservatory/Piatigorsky Artist Award\\" which gave the recipient a cash prize and a series of concert engagements. In her 40s, she developed an interest in sculpting, and arranged to take lessons from Anthony Amato. A Los Angeles-area gallery put on the first exhibition of her works in 1976. Widowed at the age of 65, she continued working and playing tennis into her 90s. As of 2003, she was still actively sculptinghttp://www.armchair.com/aware/aging1.html and she turned 100 in November 2011. Piatigorsky died from complications of pneumonia on July 15, 2012.

In April 1926 the station was acquired by the Portland News, which changed the call sign to KOIN\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1926, page 7. and moved the station's studios to the New Heathman Hotel.\\"News Opens Station KOIN\\", Morning Oregonian, April 23, 1926, page 16. KOIN was a CBS Radio Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" It was also an affiliate of the Don Lee Network, based on the West Coast. In March 1941, KOIN moved from 940 kHz to 970 kHz, following the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). In 1948, KOIN added an FM station, KOIN-FM, which today is co-owned 101.1 KXL-FM. KOIN-FM mostly simulcast the AM station until the late 1960s, when it began airing classical music in the evening. In 1953, KOIN put a TV station on the air, Channel 6 KOIN-TV. Because KOIN Radio was a CBS Radio affiliate, KOIN-TV carried CBS TV shows. =1950s-1980s= In the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to television, KOIN began airing a full service middle-of- the-road format. On May 12, 1977 the call letters changed to KYTE featuring a Top 40 hits format. On September 4, 1979, it switched to country music as \\"97 Country.\\" In 1981, the station flipped to automated \\"Music of Your Life\\" adult standards programming. On January 27, 1989, KYTE began playing classical music, picking up that format when 101.1 KYTE-FM dropped classical for smooth jazz as KKCY \\"The City.\\" The classical format turned out to be short-lived on AM 970. =1990s= In 1990, the station changed call letters to KESI and aired a mostly instrumental easy listening format branded as \\"Easy 970.\\" On May 1, 1991, the station again changed call letters to KBBT and began stunting. 18 days later, the station began airing an alternative rock format known as \\"970 The Beat.\\" In July 1996, KBBT began simulcasting on KDBX 107.5 FM (now KXJM), and tweaked its format to Modern AC. On October 2, 1996, The Beat was moved to FM, while 970 changed call letters to KUPL and switched to classic country (as \\"Straight Country 970\\"). On September 19, 1997, American Radio Systems, owner of six Portland radio stations, announced that Westinghouse Electric, the owner of CBS Radio, had bought all of its U.S. radio stations, including KUPL. KUPL switched to oldies as \\"Cruisin' Oldies 970\\" on January 23, 2001. =2000s= On August 1, 2001, KUPL changed call letters to KUFO, and on August 7, switched to a new hot talk format, branded as \\"Extreme Talk 970.\\" Hosts featured on \\"Extreme Radio\\" include Bob Rivers, Don & Mike, Opie & Anthony, The Sports Junkies and Ron & Fez.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-08-10.pdf On October 11, 2002, after a brief simulcast with active rock KUFO-FM, 970 changed its call letters back to KUPL, returning to classic country as \\"Straight Country 970.\\" KCMD branding AM 970 continued as KUPL until February 2, 2005.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/altc_list.pl?Facility_id=26926 At that point, it became KCMD, letters chosen to reflect its \\"all-comedy format.\\" That same year, after MAX 910 abandoned its hot talk format, CBS Radio (formerly Infinity Broadcasting before December 2005), hoping to enlarge the station's audience, decided to broadcast syndicated programming, including The Tom Leykis Show, Phil Hendrie, and Don and Mike, shows that had previously aired on MAX 910. At the same time, the station was renamed \\"Johnson 970\\". By early 2006, CBS Radio asked Rick Emerson to take over as program director and return on-air after being dropped from \\"MAX 910.\\" Emerson was accompanied by on-air producer Sarah X Dylan and newsman Tim Riley. Within months, Johnson 970 became \\"AM 970 Solid State Radio,\\" and took on more syndicated broadcasts from around the country, including Dennis Miller. After the launch of \\"Solid State Radio\\", the station added a local weekend show (Miles Around Radio & Television), and became the affiliate for Dr. Demento, The Mike O'Meara Show, and The John and Jeff Show, as well as syndicating Fox Sports Radio. On June 23, 2008, KCMD's slogan changed from \\"Solid State Radio\\" to \\"The Talker.\\" On March 12, 2009, The Rick Emerson Show moved to KCMD's sister station KUFO-FM to replace the canceled The Adam Carolla Show. =Alpha Broadcasting= In August 2009, CBS Radio sold its Portland cluster, including KCMD, to Alpha Broadcasting in an effort to focus on major market stations. Alpha rebranded the station to \\"Freedom 970\\" on September 14, 2009, and on May 24, 2010 changed its call letters to KXFD to reflect this branding. KXFD concentrated on mostly conservative talk shows. On March 22, 2011, the station was reassigned the call sign KUFO which it had previously held from August 2001 to October 2002. The call sign became available after co-owned 101.1 FM changed its call letters from KUFO to KXL-FM. KUFO 970 continued its conservative talk format.

The original studios were located in Indio. Its relays were KCBI 97.3, when it was affiliated with CBS Radio, and KECI 97.7, broadcasting into the Imperial Valley/Imperial County. In October 1983, the station changed its call sign to KEZN. By 1987, the studios were moved to a new facility in Palm Desert. =Switch to soft AC= In the early 1990s, the station switched to the nationally syndicated \\"Format 41\\" soft adult contemporary service of the Unistar Radio Network. In 1994, KEZN became the only AC station in the Palm Springs market when KPLM flipped to a country music format. Noted Los Angeles broadcaster Russ O'Hara teamed with local personality Kayla Stone for the \\"Russ and Kayla\\" morning drive time show, as the station eliminated the Format 41 service to go with local programming. Another local DJ, Debra Kaye Ahlers, occupied the midday shift, while program director Dale Berg, a noted personality from Orange County, handled afternoon drive. Later, former Nashville Network announcer Dan McGrath took over morning drive, while former KCLB personality John O (John Ostrum) assumed the afternoon slot. In 1996, Gary Bell arrived from KCBS-FM in Los Angeles. Ryan Yamanaka also served as an on-air personality from 2000 to 2001 working the overnight shift. He was also the last personality to drive KEZN's \\"Mr. Frosty\\".

The station was located north of Kelly's Corners between New York State Route 30 and the railroad tracks, just opposite the cemetery. When it was first built, it was nothing but a board- and-batten flag stop and a place for local farmers to drop off milk. It was soon replaced with a new station, which was a few hundred feet away, but the new station never made much business, and it became a flag stop again in the 1920s. In addition to the station, the railroad also maintained a section house and a coal pocket here. Two creameries were located in Kelly's Corners: the first: \\"Yankee Creamery\\" was near the present day grade crossing of State Route 30 and the railroad right of way. Some of the field stone foundation can be located with the brush. Documentation that the Yankee Creamery was joint venture between Hanford S. Shultis, owner of \\"Elgin of the Catskills\\" dairy farm; and E. Louis Kadans, owner of Kadan's Creamery in Dunraven, NY. The other creamery, the \\"Eureka Creamery\\" was located on the opposite side of the valley from the station (present day 'Frog Alley'). Eureka Creamery moved milk cans back and forth from the U&D; using a push cart which ran on tracks set on a trestle running from the station, across the river and into the creamery. By the 1950s the station had been moved across the highway and sat in front of the cemetery.

This layer is made of rocks rich in magnesium silicate minerals. Typically when the sima comes to the surface it is basalt, so sometimes this layer is called the 'ocean layer' of the crust. The sima layer is also called the 'basal crust' or 'basal layer' because it is the lowest layer of the crust. Because the ocean floors are mainly sima, it is also sometimes called the 'oceanic crust'. The name 'sima' was taken from the first two letters of silica and of magnesia. Comparable is the name 'sial' which is the name for the upper layer of the Earth's continental crust. Petrology The sima has a higher density (2800 to 3300 kg/m3) than the sial, which is due to increased amounts of iron and magnesium, and decreased amounts of aluminium. When the denser sima comes to the surface it forms mafic rocks, or rocks with mafic minerals. The most dense sima has less silica and forms ultramafic rocks.

She was educated at Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York and after finishing school she went to Paris.The Independent: \\"OBITUARY: Marie-Helene de Rothschild\\" by Hugo Vickers March 12, 1996  Marriages  Marie-H√©l√®ne was married twice: *In 1950, she married the French Count Fran√ßois de Nicolay (1919‚Äì1963) a horsebreeder whom she had met in Paris after school. They had one son, Philippe de Nicolay (b. 1955). They divorced in 1956. Philippe is a director of Paris Orleans PA, a French investment bank belonging to the Rothschild family.People: Paris Orleans S.A. (PROR.PA)Reuters Finance Philippe is married to Princess Sophie de Ligne, the daughter of Belgium's Antoine, Prince of Ligne and princess Alix of Luxembourg. *In 1957, she married her third cousin once-removed Baron Guy de Rothschild, (1909‚Äì2007) head of the de Rothschild Fr√®res bank. They were married on February 17, 1957 in New York City. This was the first time a head of one of the Rothschild families had married a non- Jewish spouse. Guy was forced to resign from the presidency of the Jewish community in France. Marie-H√©l√®ne, being Catholic, was required to get a papal dispensation in order to annul her first marriage so that she could remarry outside the Catholic faith. They had one child, Edouard Etienne Alphonse, who was raised Jewish.  Ferri√®res Ch√¢teau  Her husband and his sisters, Jacqueline and Bethsab√©e, had been raised at the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res in the country outside of Paris. Seized by the Germans during the occupation of France in World War II, the ch√¢teau remained empty until 1959 when the newlywed Rothschilds decided to reopen it. Marie-H√©l√®ne took charge of refurbishing the huge ch√¢teau, making it a place where European nobility mingled with musicians, artists, fashion designers and Hollywood movie stars at grand soir√©es. Much talked about for the lavish and creative theme balls and charity fundraisers she organized both in Paris and New York, in 1973, she brought together five French couturiers and five American designers for a fashion show at the Th√©√¢tre Gabriel in the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. She hosted regular parties at the Ch√¢teau, mainly inviting aristocracy, but which also included her friends from a wider society such as Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn (with whom she was a close friend).The Richard Burton Diaries, By Richard Burton, Yale University Press 2012, page 550 In 1975, Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res was gifted to the chancellery of the universities of Paris by Guy and Marie-H√©l√®ne de Rothschild but they retained the home they had built in the woods surrounding the ch√¢teau.  H√¥tel Lambert  In 1975, the couple purchased H√¥tel Lambert on the √éle Saint-Louis, one of the most luxurious mansions in Paris, where they took up residence in the top floors. Marie- H√©l√®ne became friends with the socialite Baron Alexis de Red√© who was a tenant on the first floor in H√¥tel Lambert and who would later become a fixture at her gatherings. In recognition of her importance in promoting French culture and fashion on an international level, Marie-H√©l√®ne de Rothschild was awarded the Legion of Honor.  Illness and death  After battling cancer and crippling rheumatoid arthritis for more than ten years, Marie-H√©l√®ne de Rothschild died in 1996 at her Ferri√®res country home, aged 68. A Catholic funeral mass was held at the Saint-Louis-en-l'√éle church in Paris, funeral guests were Val√©ry Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, Claude Pompidou, Bernadette Chirac, Gianni Agnelli, Alain Delon and Yves Saint Laurent. She was buried in Touques, Calvados where for more than a century her husband's branch of the French Rothschild family has owned Haras de Meautry, a noted horse farm.

Despite being blind in his right eye, his on-ice officiating career spanned the greater part of the 1940s and 1950s, during which he pioneered the system of hand signals for penalties which is now used in all hockey games internationally. He later was a popular broadcaster for the New York Rangers on radio and television. Amateur hockey playing career Born in Manhattan, New York City, he attended Jamaica High School. While playing as a center for a Metropolitan Amateur Hockey League All-Star team at Madison Square Garden in 1935, he was struck in the right eye by an errant puck during a line change against a team from Boston. Even though the doctors at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital weren't able to restore vision to his right eye, he continued to play the sport with the New York Rovers of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. NHL officiating pioneer Chadwick was encouraged to become a referee by his former Rovers' coach, Tommy Lockhart. His first experience as an on-ice official was in a Rovers game in March 1937, when he substituted for the scheduled referee who was stuck in a snowstorm. His work in the amateur circuit caught the attention of then-NHL president Frank Calder, who hired him as the league's first American-born linesman in 1939. The first professional match Chadwick worked was between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Americans at The Garden. After one year of service in the NHL, he was promoted to referee, eventually becoming the first one to use hand signals during games in the early 1940s. The system he developed was adopted by the NHL in 1956, one year after his retirement. During his fifteen seasons as a referee, he worked over 900 regular season contests and a record 42 Stanley Cup Finals matches, 13 of them series deciders. He became the fifth on-ice official, the first American-born, to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964. \\"The Big Whistle\\" He has been elected to both the Hockey Hall of Fame and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Chadwick spent 14 seasons as a hockey color analyst both on radio and television for the New York Rangers. From 1967‚Äì72, he worked on radio with Marv Albert, and in 1972 moved to television broadcasts on WOR-TV, Channel 9 and the MSG Network. His 1972‚Äì73 partner was Sal Marchiano, and from 1973‚Äì81 he was paired with Jim Gordon.

Biography Gordini was born in Bazzano, currently part of the Metropolitan City of Bologna in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. He was a young boy when he became fascinated with automobiles and racing. In his early teens, he worked as a mechanic for Alfieri Maserati. After serving in the Italian army during World War I, in 1926 he married and settled in Paris, France: parenthood quickly followed. In France, he raced Fiat cars in Grand Prix motor racing events and at the 24 hours of Le Mans. He was a particular fan of the Fiat Balilla, released in early 1932. Using a Balilla chassis he developed a unique roadster which he used in his first races. In 1934 Gordini approached Henri Pigozzi, Fiat's French \\"General Representative\\". Pigozzi was a close friend and business partner of Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's owner. Since 1928 Pigozzi had been assembling Fiats at Suresnes, in France, using a combination of imported and locally sourced components. In November 1934 Pigozzi's Fiat assembly business relocated to larger premises at Nanterre, and out of this Simca was born. Gordini had already established a strong reputation as a racing driver and as an engineer with a specialist's understanding of Fiats. A bond between Gordini and Pigozzi existed naturally, partly because they were both Italian expatriates who had moved to France after the war. Gordini rapidly found himself the head of the Simca motor racing department. He quickly showed a flair for improving the performance from the cars' basic Fiat designed engines without incurring massive expenditure, acquiring the sobriquet \\"le sorcier de la m√©canique\\" (roughly \\"the mechanic- wizard\\"), and staying with Simca till 1951. From the 1940s, his son Aldo joined his racing team as a mechanic and occasional driver. The break with Simca arose over the extent of the manufacturer's support for Simca-Gordini participation at the top level of motor racing, including Formula 1.http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/con-gordi.html In 1952 Gordini founded the independent Gordini company to build a line of sports cars for racing. In 1953 the government of France awarded Am√©d√©e Gordini the Legion of Honor. The cars that Gordini sent to the race track in Le Mans were very fast. Gordini‚Äôs engine tuner, also called the ‚Äúsorcerer‚Äù, breathed Grand Prix performance into regular engines - a feat no one believed possible. The Mus√©e National de l'Automobile de Mulhouse in Mulhouse, France featuring the Schlumpf Collection has in its collection Grand Prix and road racing cars of the Gordini brand. Exhibits include a type 16 Grand Prix from 1954, a single seater type 32 from 1956 and the Gordini 26 S, the car driven by the famous French author Fran√ßoise Sagan. Despite racing successes, after World War II, obtaining adequate financial support for racing had become increasingly difficult, and the business struggled financially without the backing of Pigozzi. Timely salvation appeared in 1957 when Renault engaged Gordini. During the final two decades of his career his technical skills were combined with the financial muscle of France's largest automaker to give birth to a succession of performance versions of mass market cars, starting with the Renault Dauphine and including the Renault Caravelle, Renault 5 Alpine Turbo, Renault 8, Renault 12 and the Renault 17. In Brazil, technical changes in the Brazilian version of Renault Dauphine, manufactured by Willys-Overland, caused the company to rename this car model in 1962, releasing it with the popular nickname Gordini. Gordini died after several months of acute illness at the end of May 1979, in Paris, less than a month short of his eightieth birthday. He was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery. Sadly he died a few weeks too early to be present for the first Formula 1 victory of the Renault V6 turbo racing engine, developed by the Renault Sport division into which he had merged his own company, and which he had built up since 1969.

It was originally transmitted on 5 September 1975. Synopsis The platoon are going to be featured in a film to help the war effort, but are annoyed to find they are playing the Nazis. Chaos ensues when they are mistaken for real German soldiers, triggering an invasion alert. Plot The platoon are to be featured in a film to help the war effort. Private Pike, a keen cinema-goer, is very excited but once the film producers arrive to measure them for uniforms, it becomes clear that the platoon are going to be playing the Nazis. Despite his protests, Captain Mainwaring is informed that they will be only in the distance anyway. Mainwaring is measured for his uniform, but they do not have an officer's uniform to fit him. Instead, Wilson and Pike are chosen to be the officers. Mainwaring is excused from appearing in the film by the Colonel. The platoon are dressed as German soldiers for their parts. Pike is enjoying his turn as an officer, goosestepping around and acting like the German officers he has seen at the cinema. Mainwaring informs the platoon that they must stay inside Jones' van to avoid being spotted and creating an alarm. Once they reach the film location, they are met by the producer who says that the filming has been postponed due to a problem with the lead actors, much to Mainwaring's disgust. Mainwaring halts outside the \\"Six Bells\\" public house to telephone Headquarters. Pike sees the pub and persuades Wilson that, now they are officers, they should all go for a drink. Thus the platoon converge upon the pub dressed as Nazis, much to the shock of the landlord. The landlord tells his barmaid to warn the village. Mainwaring discovers what has happened and orders the men outside, where they are met by an angry mob. They accuse Mainwaring of being a quisling. The landlord telephones Walmington-on-Sea to tell the Home Guard that Nazis are heading that way. Unfortunately, the telephone is answered by Hodges and the vicar, who assume the landlord is drunk. After seeing the backs of the platoon, who are still dressed as Nazis they decide to sound the alarm by ringing the church bells. Wilson realises what has happened and Mainwaring tells Pike to phone Headquarters to inform them it is not an invasion. Pike returns laughing to inform Mainwaring that the whole south coast was on red alert and the Brigadier himself wanted to know what \\"blithering idiot\\" was responsible.

Powell (born ) is and English professional rugby league coach who is the head coach of the Castleford Tigers in the Super League. He is a former professional rugby league footballer who played as a in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. He played for Sheffield Eagles, Keighley Cougars and Leeds Rhinos, as well as Balmain Tigers and Gold Coast Seagulls in Australia. He played over 450 games including 33 caps for Great Britain, and made appearances in the Super League Grand Final and in two Challenge Cup Finals for the Leeds Rhinos. At Sheffield he formed a key partnership with Mark Aston, and holds the club record for the most individual tries in a match (5) and he did hold the record for most career tries (114) until this was broken by Menzie Yere in 2013. Background Powell was born in Ackworth, Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Playing career Powell was selected to go on the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. His Testimonial match at Sheffield Eagles took place in 1994. He played for England in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. =Leeds Rhinos= Powell played for Leeds at stand- off half in their 1998 Super League Grand Final loss to Wigan. He was a member of the Rhinos' 1999 Challenge Cup winning team. He played stand-off in the final as the Rhinos beat London Broncos 52‚Äì16 to claim their first silverware since 1978. Coaching career =Keighley Cougars= Powell's first coaching appointment was as player/coach at Keighley where he was appointed at the end of the 1996 season. He was in charge for 24 games before his transfer to Leeds at the end of June 1997 although his tenure as coach at Keighley continued until July 1997. Under his leadership Keighley won 14, lost 9 and drew 1 game. =Leeds Rhinos= After he retired from playing in 2001, he became coach of Leeds Rhinos. The Rhinos appeared to be on an upward trajectory under Powell, finishing 5th then 4th in his first two seasons. In his third season in charge, the club reached the 2003 Challenge Cup Final but lost 22‚Äì20 to Bradford Bulls. Trailing by 2 points with 5 minutes remaining, the Rhinos were awarded a penalty. Captain Kevin Sinfield famously opted not to take a shot at goal which would have levelled the scores. The decision backfired with the Bulls' defensive line holding firm to deny the Rhinos their first major silverware in over 30 years. The cup final defeat did not appear to affect Leeds' Super League form as they established a commanding lead at the top of the table. In spite of this, it was announced in July 2003 that Powell would be moved into a director of rugby role the following season to make way for Tony Smith to take over as head coach. Following the announcement, the Rhinos form dipped and they surrendered their lead at the top of the table to the Bradford Bulls. They then crashed out of the play-offs without winning a game. During his tenure as Rhinos coach, he handed debuts to numerous future club legends including Danny McGuire, Rob Burrow, Matt Diskin and Ryan Bailey. He also handed, a then 22-year old, Kevin Sinfield the captaincy. The group would go on to form the nucleus of the clubs famous \\"Golden generation\\". =Ireland= In 2004 Powell was the coached the Ireland national team. He led the team to the final of the 2004 European Nations Cup where they went down 36‚Äì12 to England. =Leeds Tykes= In July 2005 he made the switch to rugby union when he became the offensive coach and matchday manager for Leeds Tykes. In January 2006 he was promoted to head coach but the season ended in disappointment when the Tykes were relegated. =Featherstone Rovers= He was appointed head coach of Featherstone Rovers in September 2008. He oversaw one of the most successful periods in Featherstone Rovers' history, leading them to three consecutive Championship League Leaders' Shields and Grand Finals between 2010 and 2012. Despite winning the Championship Grand Final in 2011, Featherstone were not promoted to super league due to the controversial licensing system in place at the time. Subsequently, Powell continued to ply his trade in the second tier in 2012. In addition to again, leading the club to the 2012 league leaders shield and grand final, Powell also masterminded a famous victory over Super League side and local rivals Castleford in the Challenge Cup in what would prove to be his final season at the club. =Castleford Tigers= On 7 May 2013, Powell was announced as the new head coach of Featherstone Rovers' local rivals Castleford Tigers. Powell was awarded the Coach of the Year award for 2014, after getting the club to their first Wembley appearance for twenty years and their highest league position since Super League began. He coached the club to the 2014 Challenge Cup Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. He oversaw arguably Castleford's greatest ever season in 2017 when they won the league leaders shield for the first time in their history. Despite finishing first in the regular season by a record margin, a first top flight title continued to allude Powell as the Tigers were defeated in the 2017 Super League Grand Final by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford in a major upset.

It was published by Electronic Arts for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1987. Deathlord has a world of 16 continents, 128 unique monsters, and 20 dungeons, yet fits on two double-density 5¬º\\" floppy disks.  Story  The world of Lorn is under attack from the Deathlord's forces. The Emperor of Kodan has sent word asking for a party to defeat the Deathlord. The party must search the world to find seven words, six items, venture into Hell, defeat the Deathlord, and return. There is no linear path to the goals, and much of the story lies in subtext as the developer chose to keep dialog options to a minimum within the game.  Gameplay  The game plays as a turn based, top down, tile mapped CRPG. The player would create a party of up to 6 characters to move about the world, searching for secrets and fighting monsters. It used most of the keys on the keyboard, mapping them to specific actions. There is only one savegame slot, and the game autosaves if the party moves to another location or a party member dies. A party, once killed, needs a new party to resurrect them. Before a player can begin the game proper, they were asked to go to the utility menu and make a copy of the scenario disk. They could also import characters from other games here if they desired. Once scenario disks were made, the player then created their party of 6 characters from the 8 races and 16 classes available. They weren't limited to just 6 characters, however, and could keep a roster of other characters to switch out in the future, but any time they did, the party would be returned to the starting point of the game.  Physical contents  Deathlord came in an album style box and included two double sided disks, The first containing a side for booting the game, and a side containing utilities while the other disk was the scenario disk containing the unaltered version of the game world. The box also included a paper manual and quick reference card. The utility disk would let players import characters from The Bard's Tale, Wizardry and Ultima III, as well as rename characters.  Development  Originally, the game was intended to have a Norse/Teutonic theme, But marketing department at Electronic Arts gave Al Escudero 5 weeks to change the assets (art, story, spell names, equipment names, location names, etc.).

Criticisms included poor documentation, poor class balance, and meaningless character alignment. The game hid the townspeople with important pieces of information, making mapping necessary, and frequently the player had to search many squares in an area for an important item. She described a dungeon as \\"one of the most idiotic dungeons ever\\", with a two-level maze of locked and fake doors, with a diagonal passage full of teleports and fake walls above. Without a lack of mapping aids, this was very difficult, especially in sixteen-level dungeons that did not contribute to the story. In 1993, Scorpia called the game \\"poorly designed and implemented mishmash with a quasi-Ultima look\\", \\"extremely pointless\\", and \\"definitely one to avoid\\". Compute! discussed the game's high difficulty and poor quality of the manual. The magazine stated that Deathlord was not the most impressive game, but was a good one.https://archive.org/stream/1989-06-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_72_1989_Jun#page/n27/mode/2up Home of the Underdogss Sarinee Achavanuntakul calls Deathlord \\"One of the best, largest, and most underrated RPGs ever made\\" and goes on to say it, \\"offers a unique gameworld inspired by Japanese myths, plenty of traditional exploration-based fun, and the largest map ever made for an Apple II and Commodore 64 game.\\"http://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=4848 Richard Garriott of Origin Systems believed that Deathlord unduly resembled Origin's Ultima games. He ended Origin's affiliation with EA after the company published it, and later Ultima games included a pirate character named Pirt Snikwah.

Eight passengers on the train and a passenger in the van died. Description On 26 July 1986 the 09:33 Bridlington to Hull train, travelling at around , struck a van at Lockington Level Crossing at around 10:00, causing the train to derail. The train was made up of a two-car Class 105 DMU unit coupled to a two-car Class 114 unit. The derailed train ran down the railway embankment and the front vehicle jackknifed and fell onto its side. The van was torn into five pieces. Eight train passengers and a passenger in the van were killed. 59 people were taken to hospital, of whom 10 required further treatment. It is thought that the derailment was caused by one side of the bogie colliding with the van, followed by a wheel in the trailing bogie of the front carriage striking trackwork that had been damaged by the force of the initial derailment, causing the train to jump and the first carriage to separate from the trailing bogie. The front coach left the railway line and ran into a field, embedding itself, causing the rear of the coach to be pushed around by the rest of the train, causing it to fall on one side, and be turned around 180 degrees. The level crossing was an automatic type using flashing warning lights (an AOCR ‚Äì Automatic Open Crossing, Remotely Monitored), which had been installed in 1985/86 replacing lifting barriers operated from the adjacent signal box. There had been reported examples of the warning lights operating incorrectly before the accident, including the lights failing to activate or activating without enough warning time. The investigation concluded that the lights did operate correctly on the day of the accident. The driver of the van could not recall the incident; the evidence showed that the van was moving when struck, as the van was in gear. He was local to the area and a driver of over two decades experience, and was aware of the mode of operation of the crossing. The investigator concluded that on balance of probability the driver had been distracted before the crossing, causing him to miss the light signal. An inquest held on 25 February 1987 recorded that the persons involved in the accident died of misadventure. The line re-opened on 29 July 1986. Legacy In 2009 a campaign was launched to have a permanent memorial erected. On 25 July 2010 a memorial was unveiled at Driffield Memorial Garden at 2 pm, with over 100 people attending the service. A book about the disaster was published by Bridlington disaster author expert, Richard Jones, in September 2010. A ceremony was held on 24 July 2011 at the memorial for the 25th anniversary of the crash.

It runs through rural and wooded areas of the town of Amherst in Erie County and the town of Pendleton in Niagara County. The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 263 south of the hamlet of Getzville. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city of Lockport. The entirety of NY 270 is known as Campbell Boulevard, named after New York State Senator William W. Campbell of the Niagara-Orleans district. NY 270 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route once extended as far south as NY 5 and as far north as NY 104; however, it was gradually truncated to its current length as other routes were realigned or extended onto NY 270's alignment. Route description NY 270 through Getzville NY 270 begins at an intersection with NY 263 (Millersport Highway) in the town of Amherst NY 270 proceeds north through Amherst as Campbell Boulevard, a two-lane commercial street. The route quickly becomes residential and enters the hamlet of Getzville, where it intersects with County Route 45 (CR 45; Dodge Road). After CR 45, NY 270 continues north, immediately crossing under the lanes of I-990 (Lockport Expressway). After I-990, the route continues north along Campbell Boulevard as a two-lane residential roadway through Amherst, entering an intersection with CR 299 (North French Road). After CR 299, NY 270 bends northwest along Campbell Boulevard as the two-lane residential street through Amherst, with the residences becoming less dense as the route proceeds north. Large fields begin to surround NY 270 through Amherst as the route bends northeast into an intersection with CR 2 (Tonawanda Creek Road). Just east of that intersection is the Duane B. Rodke Memorial Athletic Field, where NY 270 crosses over Tonawanda Creek via a truss bridge. Now in the Niagara County town of Pendleton, NY 270 intersects with CR 60 (North Tonawanda Creek Road). Through Pendleton, the route remains rural, passing homes and large fields as it proceeds north. NY 270 northbound after Beach Ridge Road in Pendleton A distance to the north, NY 270 intersects with CR 96 (Bear Ridge Road). After CR 96, the route becomes residential once again, entering the hamlet of Pendleton Center, crossing over former railroad right-of-way near Pendleton Town Park. Continuing northward, NY 270 enters the center of the hamlet, intersecting with the termini of both CR 40 (Beach Ridge Road) and CR 121 (Feigle Road) at the same intersection. After Pendleton Center, NY 270 bends northeast running along Campbell Boulevard through the town of Pendleton as a two-lane residential street. Serving the eastern terminus of CR 32 (Mapleton Road), NY 270 begins bending north, intersecting with CR 6 (Lockport Road). Continuing northward, NY 270 enters the town of Cambria, where it intersects with NY 31 (Saunders Settlement Road) and NY 93 (Junction Road). This intersection serves as the western terminus of the NY 31/NY 93 concurrency and the northern terminus of NY 270. History =Designation= When NY 270 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it began at Main Street (NY 5) in the hamlet of Eggertsville and followed Eggert Road north to Millersport Highway. Here, it turned to the northeast, utilizing what is now NY 263 to the modern campus of SUNY Buffalo. While today's Millersport Highway veers east to bypass the college, the highway originally went straight through the grounds, partially by way of what is now St. Rita's Lane. North of Ellicott Creek, NY 270 proceeded to Getzville via North Forest and Stahl Roads. At Getzville, NY 270 joined its modern alignment and followed it to Saunders Settlement Road (now NY 31), where it turned northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road for a short distance to Upper Mountain Road, where it ended at NY 3 outside of Lockport. Both extents of NY 270 were realigned slightly by 1932. In the vicinity of Eggertsville, the route was reconfigured to follow Bailey Avenue and Grover Cleveland Highway between Main Street and Eggert Road. Near Lockport, NY 270 was shifted southward onto Hinman Road and Ohio Street. The latter change was made as part of a larger realignment of NY 3 through central Niagara County. The realignment of NY 270 near Lockport was short-lived as the route was moved back onto Campbell Boulevard ; however, it was also truncated to end at the junction of Campbell Boulevard and Saunders Settlement Road. NY 270 was truncated again in the mid-1930s after U.S. Route 62 (US 62) and NY 18 were realigned to follow Bailey Avenue between Main Street and Sheridan Drive (NY 324). =Truncations= By 1935, NY 270 was realigned to bypass North Forest and Stahl Roads by way of a new section of Millersport Highway. In the early 1940s, NY 270 was extended north over Junction Road to meet US 104 at Warrens Corners. Around the same time, NY 263 was extended southwest to Buffalo over NY 270. Initially, NY 263 overlapped with NY 270 along Millersport Highway; however, the overlap was eliminated in the late 1940s after NY 270 was truncated to begin at NY 263 in Getzville. Similarly, NY 270 initially overlapped with NY 93 along Junction Road from Lower Mountain Road to US 104\\\\. At Lower Mountain Road, NY 93 left NY 270 and proceeded east toward Lockport on Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads. NY 270 was truncated to the southern end of the overlap . NY 270 reference marker on NY 93 in Cambria In the late 1970s, NY 93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY 270 was cut back to its junction with Upper Mountain Road. On November 1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure that, if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY 270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY 31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY 93. This part of the agenda was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY 93 as proposed and truncating NY 270 southward to NY 31. =Other developments= On December 1, 2008, the bridge carrying NY 270 over Tonawanda Creek (also the Erie Canal) was closed to traffic to allow construction to begin on a replacement bridge over the creek. The existing bridge was built in 1941 and considered to be structurally deficient. During construction, commuter traffic was detoured onto Tonawanda Creek and Bear Ridge Roads while trucks were instructed to follow NY 263, NY 78, and NY 93 around the closed bridge. The new bridge was opened to traffic in July 2009. NY 270's intersections with Tonawanda Creek Road (Erie CR 2) and Tonawanda Creek Road North (Niagara CR 60) on the north and south approaches to the bridge were reconstructed as part of the $10.9 million project. The new bridge is similar to the former, two-lane structure; however, unlike the old one, it has wide shoulders for bicyclists and includes new sidewalks for pedestrians.

The coaster was located in the Six Flags Plaza area of Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. The model of the ride, a Space Diver coaster, was intended to be mass-produced, however, Flashback was the only installation. History =Six Flags Great America (1985-1987)= Flashback first opened in 1985 at Six Flags Great America (at Gurnee, Illinois) as Z-Force. In 1987, the ride was closed. The site was later used for a Bolliger & Mabillard stand- up roller coaster named Iron Wolf. =Six Flags Over Georgia (1988-1991)= Following the ride's closure at Six Flags Great America, it was relocated to Six Flags Over Georgia, west of Atlanta. It opened in 1988 before closing three seasons later in 1991. =Six Flags Magic Mountain (1992-2007)= The ride's final relocation was to Six Flags Magic Mountain in California. As part of the relocation, the ride was renamed from Z-Force to Flashback. It opened at the park in 1992. Flashback gained a reputation as a painful ride experience. Riders would hit their heads on the uncomfortable restraints during each hairpin dive. Starting in 1996, Flashback would be closed during the summer, as it was located right next to Hurricane Harbor. The ride was so noisy that the lifeguards were disrupted. If someone were yelling for help, the ride's annoying sound would prevent them from rescuing. The coaster's loud noise also annoyed the guests at Hurricane Harbor. The ride was left standing but not operating from 2003 until 2007. On January 23, 2007, the park announced that Flashback would be removed along with Psyclone. Originally, the park stated that Flashback may be re-built within the park for 2008, however it was dismantled and scrapped in December 2007. Summary =Ride experience= Flashback was the world's only hairpin-drop roller coaster, with 6 head-over-heels dives and a 540-degree upward spiral. It was also the only Space Dive coaster ever to be built. It was all packed into a relatively small area with of track stacked above each other. The drops were severe, producing a free-fall experience on the plunges; fast steel switchbacks connected the turns just before trains flew into the gravity-defying upward spiral. Trains reached a max of , with a 3-g force on the one and a half minute ride. = Track = Throughout its life, Flashback's track was painted blue with white supports. The style of track used on this coaster became the signature track style of coasters built by Bolliger & Mabillard. =Trains= The ride featured three trains, each with five cars. Each car featured riders arranged 4 across for a total of 20 riders per train. The trains were manufactured by Giovanola. When Flashback was known as Z-Force, the trains were painted all blue with a navy blue stripe running down on the sides of the train. The restraints were also blue. After its relocation to Six Flags Magic Mountain, Flashback's trains were repainted red with a white chassis and a white stripe on the sides of each car. The restraints were also repainted orange.

If it happens, that's usually just bad accounting (a math error), or else a case of fraud. But things are more complicated when we aggregate the accounts of many enterprises, households and government agencies (\\"institutional units\\" or transactors in social accounting language). Here, a conceptual problem arises. The basic reason is that the income of one institutional unit is the expenditure of another, and the input of one institutional unit is the output of another. If therefore we want to measure the total value-added by all institutional units, we need to devise a consistent procedure for grossing and netting the incomes and outlays of all units, within a system of transactors. Lacking such a system, we would end up double counting incomes and expenditures of interacting units, exaggerating the quantity of value-added or investments.Francois Lequiller & Derek Blades, Understanding National Accounts. Paris: OECD, 2006, p. 15. To estimate the annual net output of a country, for example, the cost of goods and services used up is deducted from gross revenue, all flows are valued uniformly, and flows which fall outside the production boundary are excluded. Value theory The system of gross and netting actually used, is ultimately based on a value theory,Utz-Peter Reich, National Accounts and Economic Value. A Study in Concepts. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, p. 11. which specifies what may generally count as: *comparable value (value equivalence) *value decrease *value increase *conserved value *transferred value *newly created value In other words, we cannot relate, group and aggregate prices in different ways without making some value-based assumptions that enable valid comparisons. Without those value assumptions, the aggregates themselves would be meaningless. Thus, when economists focus on market-prices, value assumptions are always in the back of their mind, even if they are not aware of that, and regard value theory as metaphysical. Counting units Once the principles of the value theory are established, categories and counting units can be exactly and logically defined, as a basis for mathematical operations to aggregate the flows of incomes and expenditures. All flows can then be allocated to their appropriate category, without counting the same flow several times. In fact, the value theory applied in national accounts is nowadays strongly influenced by the valuation principles of ordinary business accounts and the prevailing social relations governing economic exchange, often fixed by law. Thus, for example, it is argued that no new value can result from a unilateral transfer of funds, i.e. where funds are provided without anything being provided in return. The implicit assumption made in national accounts, is that the account at the macro-level must be similar to that at the micro-level. Economic relations are regarded as broadly the same at the micro-level and the macro-level. An individual business buys and uses up inputs and produces outputs for sale; it has costs and revenues. Thus, in social accounting all transactors are treated in a similar way (\\"as if\\" they were a business). The accounts can be criticised for being eclectic in some ways, but that is not necessarily a problem; the aim of the exercise is to identify and categorise all flows, and the user can then reaggregate them in different ways. Persistent double counting problems However, even if a consistent system of accounting rules is devised that conceptually eliminates double counting, double counting may technically still occur to some extent. *The first and most obvious reason is that, in actual accounting practice, boundary problems arise, because a flow of expenditures might be interpreted in different ways, from an accounting point of view. Sometimes, it will not be altogether clear which category a flow of expenditure belongs to exactly, it may not \\"fit\\" exactly into a category, or, it is technically impossible to separate out different flows in financial data, in such a way that is required by the social accounting system. This may mean that a flow is, in part or as a whole, inadvertently counted twice, because of difficulties with the data sources. *We might be able to identify an expenditure quite easily, yet this expenditure may not tally with the corresponding income that should exist, insofar as we can identify it (or vice versa). In that case, we have to make some assumptions or imputations based on what we do know, or can observe. Yet, some statistical discrepancies may remain. *Statisticians may not be able to keep track of fixed equipment or durables when they are resold by a business to another business after use, locally or overseas. So, the same asset can be counted twice or more. In principle, expenditure on used assets is excluded from capital formation, but in practice it is often included. *Another reason has to do with the complexities of trade, in particular trade in services and international trade. Not only can it be difficult to correctly identify, survey and allocate particular financial incomes and expenditures, but also revaluations of assets occur, creating problems of how to value goods and services as such. At the highest level, due to the expansion of foreign trade, a fraction of local value-added may consist of the local inflation of foreign- produced value-added, simply because imported foreign products are resold locally, at inflated prices, without any corresponding additional local production occurring. This may not necessarily create problems of double counting locally, but if we want to estimate world GDP, we may face double counting problems of some kind.

It is occasionally used to describe elderly individuals working beyond the age of retirement, as well as those occupations that incorporate some of the elements of both blue- and white-collar, and generally are in between the two categories in terms of income-earning capability. Grey- collar workers often have licenses, associate degrees or diplomas from a trade or technical school in a particular field. They are unlike blue-collar workers in which they can often be trained on the job within several weeks whereas grey-collar workers already have a specific skill set and require more specialized knowledge than their blue-collar counterparts. The field which most recognizes the diversity between these two groups is that of human resources and the insurance industry. These different groups must be insured differently for liability as the potential for injury is different.

She wrote and spoke to audiences and the media extensively about her mother as well as her own childhood and life. Biography =Personal life= Gillian Mary Pollock was born on 15 July 1931, the elder daughter of the children's author Enid Blyton (1897‚Äì1968) and her first husband, Major Hugh Pollock (1888‚Äì1971), a World War I veteran. On 27 October 1935, her younger sister, Imogen Mary Pollock, was born. When she was 12 and her sister was 8, their parents divorced. Her mother later married the surgeon Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters (1892‚Äì1967); and her father married the writer Ida Crowe, with whom he had a daughter, Rosemary Pollock. After divorce and remarriage, her mother decided that the best thing for Gillian and her sister was not to have contact with their father, of whom they had not seen much during World War II. Enid even changed her daughters' surname to 'Darrell Waters'. Years later, Gillian tried to contact her father Hugh; but she was never to see him again, although she did establish a relationship with her half-sister Rosemary Pollock, who also became a writer. Education Pollock was educated at Benenden School, a boarding independent school for girls in Kent in South East England, followed by the University of St Andrews in Fife in Scotland. Life and career In 1957, Pollock married Donald Baverstock, a BBC producer and executive, at St James's Church, Piccadilly; they had four children: Glyn (b. 1961, d. 1983, car accident), Sian (b. 1958, d. 2006, heart attack), Sara, and Owain. After her husband's death, she lived in Ilkley, England; she was survived by two of her four children and five grandchildren; Glyndwr, Dominic, Zoe, Alec and Georgina. =First jobs= Baverstock worked as a primary school teacher at Moorfield School, Ilkley, and wrote and spoke to audiences and the media extensively about her mother as well as her own childhood and life.

She was president of the African National Congress Youth League in the 1960s. In 1994 she was elected to the first post-apartheid South African Parliament. Her autobiography, Call Me Woman (1985), won the CNA Literary Award. Early years =Family background= Born Nnoseng Ellen Serasengwe, Kuzwayo came from an educated, politically active family. Her maternal grandfather, Jeremaiah Makgothi, was taken by his mother from the Orange Free State to the Cape to attend the Lovedale Institute, circa 1875. He qualified as a teacher and also worked as a court interpreter and a Methodist lay preacher. Makgothi was the only layman to work with Robert Moffat on the translation of the Bible into Setswana. Both Makgothi and Kuzwayo's father, Philip S. Mefare, were active in politics. Makgothi was secretary of the Orange Free State branch of the South African Native National Congress, Mefare a member of its successor, the African National Congress. =Education and career= Kuzwayo began her schooling at the school built by Makgothi on his farm in Thabapatchoa, about 12 miles from Tweespruit, Orange Free State. She attended Adams College, Amanzimtoti, and then undertook a teacher training course at Lovedale College in Fort Hare, graduating at the age of 22 and beginning a teaching career. She married Ernest Moloto when in her late twenties, and the couple had two sons, but the marriage was not a happy one, and after suffering abuse from her husband she fled to Johannesburg. She had a part as a shebeen queen, alongside Sidney Poitier in the 1951 film Cry, the Beloved Country. After her first marriage was dissolved she married Godfrey Kuzwayo in 1950.Randolph Vigne, \\"Ellen Kuzwayo: Campaigner for African women\\", The Independent, 24 April 2006. She worked as a teacher in the Transvaal until 1952, giving up teaching on the introduction of the Bantu Education Act, 1953, which cut back opportunities for black education. She then trained as a social worker (1953‚Äì55). In the 1940s, she served as secretary of the ANC Youth League.Shola Adenekan, \\"Ellen Kuzwayo\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 24 April 2006.

It is known as cl√°irseach in Irish and cl√†rsach in Scottish Gaelic. In Ireland and Scotland, it was a wire-strung instrument requiring great skill and long practice to play, and was associated with the Gaelic ruling class. It appears on Irish and British coins and coat of arms of the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and Canada. Early history Maedoc book-cover, Ireland, circa 1100: the earliest unambiguous depiction of an Irish harp 1805 Irish penny depicting an Irish harp, long used as a national symbol. The early history of the triangular frame harp in Europe is contested. The first instrument associated with the harping tradition in the Gaelic world was known as a cruit. This word may originally have described a different stringed instrument, being etymologically related to the Welsh crwth. It has been suggested that the word cl√†rsach / cl√°irseach (from cl√†r / cl√°r, a board) was coined for the triangular frame harp which replaced the cruit, and that this coining was of Scottish origin.John Bannerman, 'The Cl√†rsach and the Cl√†sair' in Scottish Studies 30, 1991, pp. 3‚Äì4.

Other Pictish sculptures predate the Utrecht Psalter, namely the harper on the Dupplin Cross c. 800 AD. Three of the four oldest authentic harps to survive are of Gaelic provenance: the Trinity College harp preserved in Trinity College Dublin, and the Queen Mary Harp and the Lamont Harp in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. The last two are examples of the small low-headed harp, and are both made from hornbeam, a wood not native to Scotland or Ireland.Rimmer 1969, p. 35. All three are dated approximately to the 15th century and may have been made in Argyll in western Scotland.See Sanger & Kinnaird 1992See Caldwell 1982. Many \\"Irish\\" harps from later periods have no provenance and could possibly be of Scottish origin. The Norman-Welsh cleric and scholar Gerald of Wales (c.1146 ‚Äì c.1223), whose Topographica Hibernica et Expugnatio Hibernica is a description of Ireland from the Anglo-Norman point of view, praised Irish harp music (if little else), but added that, in the opinion of many, the Scots had now surpassed them in that skill.Dimock 1867 (ed.), pp. 154‚Äì5: Multorum autem opinione, hodie Scotia non-tantum magistram aequiparavit Hiberniam, verum etiam in musica peritia longe praevalet et praecellit. Unde et ibi quasi fontem artis jam requirunt. Gerald refers to the cythara and the tympanum, but their identification with the harp is uncertain, and it is not known that he ever visited Scotland.Budgey 2002, p. 209. Early images of the cl√†rsach are not common in Scottish iconography, but a gravestone at Kiells, in Argyllshire, dating from about 1500, shows one with a typically large soundbox, decorated with Gaelic designs.Rimmer 1969, pp. 35‚Äì37. The Irish Maedoc book shrine dates from the 11th century, and clearly shows a harper with a triangular framed harp including a \\"T-Section\\" in the pillar. The Irish word lamhchrann or Scottish Gaelic l√†mh-chrann came into use at an unknown date to indicate this pillar which would have supplied the bracing to withstand the tension of a wire-strung harp. Three pre-16th-century examples survive today; the Brian Boru Harp in Trinity College, Dublin, and the Queen Mary and Lamont Harps, both in Scotland. One of the largest and most complete collections of 17th‚Äì18th century harp music is the work of Turlough O'Carolan, a blind, itinerant Irish harper and composer. At least 220 of his compositions survive to this day. Characteristics and function In construction the Irish and Scottish harp may in general be considered as one. A characteristic feature is the metal strings. Historical sources mention various types of wire, including brass and iron; some scholars also argue for the use of silver and gold.See Heymann 2003. The wires were attached to a massive soundbox typically carved from a single log, commonly of willow, although other woods including alder and poplar have been identified in extant harps. This harp also had a reinforced curved pillar and a substantial neck, flanked with thick brass cheek bands. The strings, usually played with the fingernails, produced a brilliant ringing sound.Rimmer 1969, p. 34. This type of harp is also unique amongst single row triangular harps in that the first two strings tuned in the middle of the gamut were set to the same pitch.Rimmer 1969, p. 54. =Components= Replica of the 'Queen Mary harp' (Cl√†rsach na Banr√¨gh M√†iri) by Davy Patton, 2007 In Scottish Gaelic, the names of the components of the cl√†rsach were as follows: * amhach (neck) * cnagan (pins) * corr (pin-board) * com (chest or soundbox) * l√†mh-chrann (tree or forepillar) * teudan (strings) * cruidhean nan teud (string shoes) * urshnaim (toggle?).Dwelly 1901‚Äì11, 1977, p. 206: cl√†rsach. The corr had a brass strap nailed to each side, pierced by tapered brass tuning pins. The treble end had a tenon which fitted into the top of the com (soundbox). On a low-headed harp the corr was morticed at the bass end to receive a tenon on the l√†mh-chrann; on a high-headed harp this tenon fitted into a mortice on the back of the l√†mh-chrann. The com (soundbox) was usually carved from a single piece of willow, hollowed out from behind. A panel of harder timber was carefully inserted to close the back. Cruidhean nan teud (string shoes) were usually made of brass and prevented the metal strings from cutting into the wood of the soundbox. The urshnaim may refer to the wooden toggle to which a string was fastened once it had emerged from its hole in the soundboard. =Playing technique= The playing of the wire-strung harp has been described as extremely difficult. Because of the long-lasting resonance, the performer had to dampen strings which had just been played while new strings were being plucked, and this while playing rapidly. Contrary to conventional modern practice, the left hand played the treble and the right the bass. It was said that a player should begin to learn the harp no later than the age of seven. The best modern players have shown, however, that reasonable competence may be achieved even at a later age. =Social function and decline= During the medieval period the wire-strung harp was in demand throughout the Gaelic territories, which stretched from the northern Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland to the south of Ireland. The Gaelic worlds of Scotland and Ireland, however, while retaining close links, were already showing signs of divergence in the sixteenth century in language, music and social structure. The function of the cl√†rsach in a Hebridean lordship, both as entertainment and as literary metaphor, is illustrated in the songs of M√†iri Nic Le√≤id (Mary MacLeod) (c.1615 ‚Äì c.1705), a prominent Gaelic poet of her time. The chief is praised as one who is skilled in judging harp-playing, the theme of a story and the pith of sense: : Tuigsear nan teud, : Purpais gach sg√®il, : Susbaint gach c√®ill n√†duir.Watson 1934, 46 ‚Äì Cr√≤nan an Taibh. The music of harp and pipe is shown to be intrinsic to the splendour of the MacLeod court, along with wine in shining cups: :Gu √†ros nach cr√¨on :Am bi g√†irich nam p√¨ob :Is nan cl√†rsach a r√¨s :Le de√†rrsadh nam p√¨os :A' cur s√†raidh air f√¨on :Is 'ga leigeadh an gn√¨omh √≤ircheard.Watson 1934: 62 ‚Äì An Cr√≤nan. Here the great Highland bagpipe shares the high status of the cl√†rsach. It would help supplant the harp, and may already have developed its own classical tradition in the form of the elaborate \\"great music\\" (ce√≤l m√≤r). An elegy to Sir Donald MacDonald of Clanranald, attributed to his widow in 1618, contains a very early reference to the bagpipe in a lairdly setting: : Is iomadh sgal p√¨obadh : Mar ri farrum nan d√¨snean air cl√†r : Rinn mi √®isdeachd a‚Äôd' bhaile... Newton & Cheape, pp. 77‚Äì78. There is evidence that the musical tradition of the cl√†rsach may have influenced the use and repertoire of the bagpipe. The oral mnemonic system called canntaireachd, used for encoding and teaching ce√≤l m√≤r, is first mentioned in the 1226 obituary of a cl√†rsair (harp player). Terms relating to theme and variation on the cl√†rsach and the bagpipe correlate to each other. Founders of bagpipe dynasties are also noted as cl√°rsach players. The names of a number of the last harpers are recorded. The blind Duncan McIndeor, who died in 1694, was harper to Campbell of Auchinbreck, but also frequented Edinburgh. A receipt for \\"two bolls of meall\\", dated 1683, is extant for another harper, also blind, named Patrick McErnace, who apparently played for Lord Neill Campbell. The harper Manus McShire is mentioned in an account book covering the period 1688 to 1704. A harper called Neill Baine is mentioned in a letter dated 1702 from a servitor of Allan MacDonald of Clanranald. Angus McDonald, harper, received payment on the instructions of Menzies of Culdares on 19 June 1713, and the Marquis of Huntly's accounts record a payment to two harpers in 1714. Other harpers include Rory Dall Morison (who died c.1714), Lachlan Dall (who died c.1721‚Äì27) and Murdoch MacDonald (who died c.1740).Keith Sanger, 'Final Chords‚Äîthe Last Scottish Harpers'; WireStrungHarp. By the middle of the eighteenth century the \\"violer\\" (fiddle player) had replaced the harper, a consequence, perhaps, of the growing influence in the Gaelic world of Lowland Scots culture. Revival A modern 'Celtic harp' in Canada In the early 19th century, even as the old Gaelic harp tradition was dying out, a new harp was invented in Ireland. It had gut strings and semitone mechanisms like an orchestral pedal harp, and was invented by Dublin pedal harp maker John Egan. It was small and curved like the historical cl√°irseach or Irish harp, but its strings were of gut and the soundbox was much lighter.Rimmer 1969. p. 67. In the 1890s a similar new harp was also developed in Scotland as part of a Gaelic cultural revival.See Collinson 1983. There is now, however, renewed interest in the wire-strung harp, or cl√†rsach, with replicas being made and research being conducted into ancient playing techniques and terminology.

The other two congregations of religious women in the tradition of the Holy Cross Family are the Marianites of Holy Cross (New Orleans, Louisiana) and the Sisters of Holy Cross (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Their motherhouse is located in Notre Dame, Indiana. They are distinct from the Sisters of the Holy Cross Menzingen, a teaching congregation founded separately in Switzerland in 1844.  History  In 1837, Father Moreau, established the Congregation of Holy Cross. The congregation took its name from the neighborhood of Sainte Croix in Le Mans, where the 12th-century church, Notre Dame du Sainte Croix, was to become the mother church of the new foundation.\\"Holy Cross: Blessed Basil Moreau, C.S.C.\\", University of Portland In 1841 Fr. Moreau founded a society of sisters within the Congregation.\\"Blessed Basil Anthony Moreau\\", Sisters of the Holy Cross In June 1843, four sisters left the mother house in France to join Father Edward Sorin C.S.C. at his mission at Notre Dame, Indiana. A second story had been added to the log chapel at Notre Dame for their convent. The Sisters of the Holy Cross had been founded originally to care for the housework in the boarding schools conducted by the priests. Upon their arrival, they took charge of the sacristy, infirmary, clothes room, etc. In 1844 a novitiate was opened at Bertrand, Michigan, six miles from Notre Dame. The sisters taught the children of the neighbourhood, and cared for several orphans. With assistance from the Society of the Propagation of the Faith the sisters were able to extend their work.Antoine, Sister Mary. \\"Sisters of the Holy Cross.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 February 2020 A school was opened at Pokagon, Michigan, in 1845. This was followed by other foundations at St. John's, Mackinac, Louisville, Lowell (Indiana), Laporte, Michigan City, and Mishawaka. In 1847 four sisters with some companions from the mother-house in France opened a convent at St. Laurent, Canada, which formed the nucleus of the subsequently erected province. In 1849 four sisters took charge of the boys' orphan asylum in New Orleans, and from there a house was opened in 1854 in New York with the sanction of Father Moreau. Sisters were sent to this establishment from Notre Dame, Canada, and New Orleans. Misunderstandings due to orders issued from France and Notre Dame led to the withdrawal of the American sisters from the new foundations, the houses of New Orleans and New York remaining subject to France. The year 1856 saw the sisters well-established in Chicago and Philadelphia. They had charge of the cathedral parochial school, St. Joseph's German school, and an industrial school in Chicago, and were installed in St. Paul's and St. Augustine's schools in Philadelphia. Later they opened a select school for boarders and day-pupils in West Philadelphia. These foundations all promised success, but the strained relations between the mother-house at Le Mans under Father Moreau and the Provincial House at Notre Dame under Father Sorin led to the recall of the sisters. In 1853, Eliza Gillespie, sister of Neal Henry Gillespie C.S.C., received the habit from Father Sorin, and sailed for France to make her novitiate as Sister Angela. After profession, she returned to Bertrand and took charge of the academy, 1854. From that time until her death (1887), Mother Angela laboured indefatigably to develop the highest intellectual and religious qualities in both teachers and students, and must be regarded as the virtual foundress of the order in the United States. On 15 August, 1855, the convent and academy were moved from Bertrand to South Bend, Indiana. St. Mary's Academy and eventually grew to become Saint Mary's College. By 1861 the sisters were operating schools and orphanages throughout the eastern half of the United States. When Father Moreau visited the provinces of Canada, Louisiana, and Notre Dame in 1857, he promulgated the Decree of Separation of the sisters from the priests and brothers. In 1869, at the advice of Bishop John Henry Luers of Fort Wayne, the Sisters of the Holy Cross in the United States separated from the motherhouse in France and formed a distinct congregation. =American Civil War= Oliver P. Morton, governor of Indiana, requested the assistance of 12 sisters from the congregation. Mother Angela Gillespie along with five other sisters volunteered as nurses. The sisters were sent to Cairo, Illinois, where they met General Ulysses S. Grant. The sisters were then sent to the regimental headquarters of General Lew Wallace‚Äôs brigade in Paducah, Kentucky. All told, some eighty sisters served as nurses, managing hospitals in Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, and Washington, DC.\\"Sisters of the Holy Cross\\", The Academy of the Holy Cross Thomas Ewing, father-in-law of General William Tecumseh Sherman, was a kinsman of Mother Angela; U.S. Representative James G. Blaine was her cousin. When generals failed to secure needed aid for the sick and wounded, she made trips to Washington on their behalf. Her influence in Washington was significant both because of her family connections and because of the recognition of her work for the sick and wounded soldiers.

Ride Gold Rusher opened along with the rest of Magic Mountain during the park's grand opening in 1971. The old style Arrow Development cars are made so the ride operator has to open them up manually. The ride normally operates with one or two trains due to the low popularity. While the ride does not have a high attendance, it is still a favorite of many guests because the ride is not as aggressive as the other roller coasters in the park. Children who prefer not riding the park's most aggressive rides such as: Apocalypse, Goliath, Revolution, Superman: Escape from Krypton and X2 ride Gold Rusher because the ride itself is not as aggressive and gives the guests a good amount of thrill. Wait times are usually no longer than 5 minutes during the off-peak season. It was the first roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain, making it a historic coaster. The ride has undergone little changes since it began operating in 1971. The coaster was temporarily closed after Christmas in 2012 due to the park's latest roller coaster, Full Throttle. Full Throttle was constructed near Goldrusher's first drop where Log Jammer used to be. Goldrusher and Full Throttle are currently open for riders as of May 2019. Height requirements In order for guests to ride Gold Rusher, riders must be at least 48 inches. Each row features two seats where there is a large t lap bar for two guests. There are no seat belts in addition to the shared lap bar. Although Gold Rusher features small drops and moderate high speed turns, Six Flags Magic Mountain labels the ride as a family friendly ride.

Generalities As of 2012, Bad Nauheim has a population of 30,788. The town is approximately north of Frankfurt am Main, on the east edge of the Taunus mountain range. It is a world-famous resort, noted for its salt springs, which are used to treat heart and nerve diseases.

(1908) pp.79,81,83,170,175,187 and it was also used at Maurice bathhouse, in Bathhouse Row in the early 1900s, during the heyday of hydrotherapy. The Konitzky Foundation, a charitable foundation and hospital for those without means, was founded in 1896 and its building occupies a central place next to the Kurpark. History On September 29, 1945 General Dwight D. Eisenhower reassigned General Patton from his beloved 3rd Army, the army he successfully led from the Battle of Normandy, to Czechoslovakia as Eisenhower could no longer keep General Patton in position as the Military Governor of Bavaria. General Patton was assigned to command the Fifteenth Army, actually a group of historians given status as an Army, with its headquarters in Bad Nauheim. On December 9, 1945, General Patton left Bad Nauheim for a hunting trip near Mannheim; he died after a car crash during the trip. The Grand Hotel in Bad Nauheim was also the location of the Gestapo-led internment of around 115 Americans who were working in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, December 1941. The group would leave Bad Nauheim on May 12, 1942. In addition, during World War II Adolf Hitler had a command complex in nearby Langenhain-Ziegenberg called Adlerhorst, \\"the Eagle's Nest\\" (not to be confused with Kehlsteinhaus of Obersalzberg, which was never referred to as \\"the Eagle's Nest\\" by the Nazis). Bad Nauheim was used as a residential area for American occupation forces after World War II. Despite its proximity to Frankfurt am Main and Hitler's command complex, Bad Nauheim was totally spared from Allied bombing. American occupants from that time were told that President Roosevelt had loved the town so much from his days there that he ordered it spared. The novel The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford (published 1915) is set in part at Bad Nauheim.

Before the Holocaust nearly 400 Jews lived in the town, making up nearly 3% of the population. On Kristallnacht the schoolhouse was desecrated and ransacked as well as Jewish stores, businesses and the synagogue. Many Jews were taken that night to concentration camps. Some were let out. Of those let out many were rearrested. By the end of the Holocaust there were just three Jews remaining in Bad Nauheim. For the most part those who were not murdered had left the country.

The village name derives from the old English 'Cealflocan' - calf enclosure. A clear nucleus of the village is centred south of the port of Faversham and north of Ashford. It dates from around AD823. Challock contains a boundary to one of the highest points on the North Downs: the contour is close to the village centre. Snowfall in January and February is occasionally heavy, when counter-prevailing north-easterly winds exist in those months. Challock is at the crossroads of two major roads: the A251 from Ashford to Faversham, and the A252, which links Maidstone to Canterbury. Prior to the construction of a roundabout, the crossroads was a notorious accident hotspot for drivers coming from Chilham and Ashford, due in part to the Halfway House public house which stands close to the corner. William the Conqueror gave the manor of Challock to Battle Abbey, and it remained in the Abbey's possession until the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII in the 16th century. A smock mill stood to the north of the village until 1906 when it was destroyed by a storm - the mill had not been working for many years prior to this event. The parish church is dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian; it has fine wall paintings by celebrated local artist John Ward and his friend Gordon Davies. There is also a Methodist chapel in the village. A Goose Fair is held in September each year. The showjumper William Funnell was born and raised in the village.

History Man Man released their debut The Man in a Blue Turban with a Face in October 2004 on Ace Fu Records, but did not begin to tour extensively until their follow-up album Six Demon Bag was released in 2006 to positive reviews. During 2007, the band opened for Modest Mouse on several U.S tours, gaining them further public attention. Not long afterward, Nike began airing a series of commercials starring Rainn Wilson with Man Man's \\"10 lb Mustache\\" as the background music. \\"10 lb Mustache\\", \\"Feathers\\", and \\"Engrish Bwudd\\" were featured in season 3, episode 8 of the TV show Weeds.

They performed at numerous festivals including Voodoo Experience, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, All Tomorrow's Parties, Primavera Sound, and the Meredith Music Festival that same year. Man Man released their fourth album Life Fantastic in May 2011 with producer Mike Mogis (of Bright Eyes and Monsters of Folk fame). The album featured a less \\"wacky\\" and more somber sound than previous releases. The first song written for the album \\"Steak Knives\\" was inspired by a failed relationship and the death of several close friends. It took Kattner (Honus Honus) over a year to write. In 2011 and 2017, Honus released albums with the indie supergroup Mister Heavenly. Man Man's fifth studio album, On Oni Pond was released on September 10, 2013. The album was again produced by Mike Mogis. The first single, \\"Head On\\", peaked at #32 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

He is also known as an author and developer of the Chinook sled dog breed. Early life Arthur Treadwell Walden was born on May 10, 1871 in Indianapolis, Indiana to an Episcopal clergyman named Rev. Treadwell Walden and his wife, Elizabeth Leighton. Walden spent much of his youth in Minnesota and was educated at the Chattuck Military School in Faribault. In 1890 his father was appointed minister of St. Paul's Cathedral in Boston. Disliking city life in Boston, Arthur went to live at his father's vacation home in Tamworth, New Hampshire. Arthur's father, Rev. Treadwell Walden In Alaska and the Yukon Restless and wanting adventure, Walden traveled to Alaska in March 1896. In August 1896 gold was discovered in the Klondike. During the gold rush, Walden found himself working as a freighter carrying supplies and mail down the Yukon River. He became experienced with sled dogs that were used to pull freight over vast distances. The use of sled dogs led to freighters being called \\"dog punchers\\" Breeding the Chinook After returning to New England, Walden married Katherine Sleeper on December 9, 1902 in Tamworth, New Hampshire. She was a relative of his stepmother and the daughter of a wealthy Boston newspaper family. The couple operated the 1300-acre Wonalancet Farm and Inn. Walden began training and breeding sled dogs at the farm. On January 17, 1917, a litter of three dogs was born that Walden had bred from a female Greenland Dog and a male Mastiff/St. Bernard mix farm dog. One of those dogs, Chinook, was the progenitor of the breed that bears his name. He named the dog after a favorite Eskimo dog he worked with in the Yukon. The breed would eventually be named the state dog of New Hampshire. In 1922, he convinced a local newspaper to sponsor the first 123-mile Eastern International Dog Derby, bringing the sport of dog sled racing to New England. Walden founded the New England Sled Dog Club in 1924. In 1928 Walden published his memoir, A Dog- Puncher in the Yukon. Antarctic Expedition In 1927, Richard Byrd selected Walden to run the dog teams during his first Antarctic Expedition. Walden would only agree to accompany Byrd if he guaranteed that no dogs would be shot to save supplies, as had been done in previous expeditions. A few members of the expedition spent the winter of 1927-1928 at the Walden farm training and testing trail gear. During the expedition, Walden and his 13 dogs moved thousands of pounds of supplies from the ship over the 16 mile trail to base camp. Chinook, the first dog of his breed, disappeared (presumably dying) on January 17, 1929 while moving supplies to base camp. Walden received the Congressional Medal for his efforts during the Antarctic Expedition in 1931. Death Walden died on March 26, 1947, while saving his wife from a fire in the kitchen of their farmhouse.

It is a day school serving grades 6‚Äì12. History In the early 1960s, a group of 39 Manchester families came together to establish a new school, focused on educating the \\"whole child\\" like a boarding school; however, it would be a day school, allowing for family involvement in students' daily lives. The school was incorporated in July 1964, and in the fall of 1965, The Derryfield School opened its doors, with 108 students in grades 7‚Äì10, and 11 faculty members. Grades 11 and 12 were added in the two successive years as the original tenth grade students advanced; the first commencement was held in 1968. Grade 6 was added in 1999. While naturally focusing on academics, the founders also wanted students to be well-rounded, civic-minded individuals, able to make a positive difference in their community. So, from the school's beginnings, additional emphasis was placed on the arts, athletics, and community service. The school spent its first year and a half in the Boys Club in downtown Manchester. In February 1967, the first buildings of its new campus were completed on River Road, north of downtown, and the school relocated there. Since then, the school has grown to almost 400 students in seven grades and a faculty and staff of more than 80. The campus has continued to expand to meet the requirements of the growing student body and education in the 21st century. The focus on educating the whole child has not changed, however. Alongside the academic program, athletics, the arts, and community service continue to be the foundation of a Derryfield education. Campus The original parcel of land on which the school buildings sit was bought from the Morrison family in 1965. Construction of the first campus buildings began immediately, and the school moved into its new facilities in February 1967. As the student body grew, numerous campaigns were launched to expand the school's facilities. The first, in 1973, financed the construction of the Center for Student Activities ‚Äì the current gymnasium which, at the time, also served as an auditorium. In 1981, a connector from the academic building to the gym was built, to house the school's library, administrative offices, and a student forum. A performing arts theater was completed in 1988, and a new middle school building was added in 1999. The Gateway Building, completed in 2010, contains the admission, development, college counseling and business offices, as well as the offices of Breakthrough Manchester. A new Science and Innovation Center was completed in 2019 and contains wet and dry labs, a makerspace, robotics lab, inspiration lounge, and an audio/video production studio. The grounds were expanded in 1996, when the school acquired of land, adjacent to its original parcel, from New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University). The school used this additional acreage to build six new athletic fields and a cross-country running course, allowing for the continued expansion of its athletic offerings. The Turf Field, Derryfield's premier artificial surface athletic field, was built in 2008, with floodlights added in 2009. Drainage and special snow blowing equipment make it ready to use in or after almost any weather situation. Derryfield's soccer, field hockey and lacrosse teams use it regularly, and the baseball and softball teams use it for practice when their grass fields are unplayable. The field is also used by outside clubs and teams, either for regular rental, or in the early spring, when their own grass fields may be still frozen or underwater. The construction of a new athletic and wellness center was completed in November 2019. The new building is located on top of the land where the tennis courts used to be, across from the building with the old gym. Athletics Derryfield offers a comprehensive interscholastic athletic and physical activity program on several levels, competing in numerous sports in both the Middle and Upper Schools during all three seasons. The Middle School teams compete in the Tri-County League, with teams from New Hampshire's Merrimack, Hillsborough and Rockingham counties. The Upper School is a New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association Division IV member school, although some sports such as lacrosse and field hockey compete in higher divisions, due to the team's record of success. There are also opportunities to participate in non-team and independent sports in both the Middle and Upper Schools. Every student in grades 7‚Äì12 is required to participate in two seasons of physical activity each year. Missing a practice or a game is considered as serious as missing a class. Failure to complete the physical activity requirement will jeopardize graduation. = Sports offerings =  Middle school  * Soccer (boys & girls) * Field hockey (girls) * Cross-country (boys & girls) * Alpine and Nordic skiing (boys & girls) * Basketball (boys & girls) * Strength training (boys & girls) * Baseball (boys) * Softball (girls) * Lacrosse (boys & girls) * Tennis (boys & girls)  Upper school  (championshipshttp://www.nhiaa.org/PDFs/3227/Champions.pdf prior to 2000 not listed) * Soccer (boys & girls) boys: state champs 2001, 2002, 2009, 2012‚Äì2015; girls: state champs 2000, 2001, 2005, 2008‚Äì2010, 2014, 2015 * Field hockey (girls) D-II, state champs 2007, 2010‚Äì2013, 2018 * Cross country (boys & girls) * Golf (co-ed) D-III, state champs 1999, 2002‚Äì2005, 2012‚Äì2013, * Crew (boys & girls) * Basketball (boys & girls) * Alpine and Nordic skiing (boys & girls) boys' alpine: state champs 2010, 2014, 2016 * Strength training (boys & girls) * Swimming (co-ed) * Hockey (co-ed) D-II first season 2014‚Äì2015 * Baseball (boys) state champs 2003 * Softball (girls) * Tennis (boys & girls) boys: D-II, state champs 2003‚Äì2009, 2014; girls: D-III, state champs 2000, 2006, 2008‚Äì2010 * Lacrosse (boys & girls) boys: D-II, state champs 2010, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018; girls: D-III, state champs 2014 * Track & field (co-ed) * Equestrian (co-ed) * Yoga (co-ed) In both middle and high school, students have the option to participate in what is called an Independent Sport.

He has performed with Frank Turner, Star Fucking Hipsters, and Against Me! His book The Humorless Ladies of Border Control, about DIY touring in the former Communist world, was published by The New Press in August 2016. The New York Times named it a \\"Season's Best Travel Book.\\" His writing has appeared in The New York Times, Slate, The Kenyon Review, The Paris Review Daily, the Los Angeles Review of Books, Ploughshares, The Threepenny Review, LitHub, Longreads, The Week, VICE, and elsewhere. Career =Early career= Nicolay grew up in Center Sandwich, New Hampshire, and graduated from New York University's music program. =World/Inferno Friendship Society= Nicolay joined the New York City anarcho-circus punk band the World/Inferno Friendship Society in late 2000. He recorded three full-length albums with the band and was a member of their longest continuous lineup 2000-2007. =Anti-Social Music= In 2001, Nicolay organized \\"An Afternoon of Anti-Social Chamber Music\\" at Columbia University, a program of new music from emerging New York-based composers. This concert led to the founding of Anti-Social Music, a non-profit new-music collective of composers and performers that presents concerts of premieres by emerging (primarily New York-based) composers. Since the first \\"Afternoon,\\" the group has played over 75 shows, premiered 123 new works by 28 composers, and seen over 110 performers have played or recorded with them. Nicolay's compositions appear on their CDs \\"Greatest Hits‚Ä¶LIVE(ish)\\" and \\"Sings The Great American Songbook\\". =Guignol= Guignol, described by the Times of London as \\"a combination of punk, jazz, folk, tango, klezmer, cheap red wine, woolly pinstriped suits, newsboy caps and one waxed moustache,\\" is a quartet founded in 2002 by Nicolay and clarinetist Peter Hess (World/Inferno Friendship Society, Balkan Beat Box) to accompany performers from the Coney Island sideshow at a weekly show at CBGB. They became a part of the growing New York gypsy-punk scene and released a full-length, self-titled album in 2004 and the EP \\"Drink The Best Wine First\\" in 2005.http://www.deadmetaphor.com/artnoise/?p=203 In 2005, Guignol made a guest appearance on the album \\"Smash The Windows,\\" by the Philadelphia folk-punk band Mischief Brew. In 2009, they released a full-length collaboration called \\"Guignol & Mischief Brew Fight Dirty,\\" which included six songs by each band, as well as covers of songs by Django Reinhardt and Iron Maiden. \\"Fight Dirty,\\" off \\"Guignol & Mischief Brew Fight Dirty,\\" appeared in the superhero movie Deadpool 2: Super Duper Cut, and on the soundtrack album.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5463162/soundtrack =The Hold Steady= After guesting on The Hold Steady's debut \\"Almost Killed Me,\\" Nicolay joined the band in 2004: \\"World/Inferno played some shows with Lifter Puller in Chicago a long time ago, then when Craig moved to New York he was doing A&R; for the now-defunct DCN live label and signed us up for the live record \\"Hallowmas at Northsix\\". Over the course of working on that, we'd go out drinking with him and Tad when the Hold Steady was kind of coming together as \\"this new band we're sort of working on\\". When it finally happened, they called and asked me and Peter to come play on the first record (\\"Almost Killed Me\\"), which led to me coming and playing those three songs on NY shows whenever it worked out, which led to \\"Hey, do you wanna get together and work on some songs for the new record?\\", which became \\"Well, do you want to join the band?\\" During his time with the band, The Hold Steady earned almost universal praise by the press for their performances and records. In 2010, Nicolay announced he had left the Hold Steady after five years with the band. In 2016 The Hold Steady announced a series of concerts celebrating the tenth anniversary of Boys and Girls in America, featuring Nicolay with the band. =Solo= In 2007, Nicolay released Black Rose Paladins, a set of solo demos.

He was the son of Andrew Guigues VI and Beatrice of Montferrat. When his father died, his mother helped guide the leadership of the new Dauphin. He fought great contests over the counties of Embrun and Gap with Charles, Count of Provence and Forcalquier. Those counties were the dowry of his father's first wife, Beatrice of Forcalquier. Guigues VI had repudiated his first wife and married a second, giving the counties of his former wife to the son of his second: Guigues VII. Charles, as heir to the county of Forcalquier, claimed the counties. A compromise was eventually reached whereby Guigues retained Embrun, but Charles received Gap. In 1239, the young Dauphin entered negotiations to marry Cecile of Baux with the help of his ally, Raymond VII of Toulouse. Cecile's father, Barral later claimed that he only negotiated the engagement under threats against his life. In 1241, he became engaged to Beatrice of Savoy, daughter of Peter of Savoy and Agnes of Faucigny. Peter's brother, Philip agreed to help the Dauphin fight the count of Valentinois. In 1247, Guigues was summoned by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor to join the army he was assembling in Savoy. This army was being gathered to attack the Pope in Lyon, though ultimately Frederick was distracted by other battles in Italy. In 1253, Guigues married Beatrice (1237‚Äì1310). For her dowry, Beatrice brought Guigues Faucigny, a distant territory menacing Savoy, the traditional enemy of the Viennois. Many wars of Guigues' descendants would be aimed at the defence of this land from the Savoyard counts.

The woman, Sarah Caul, played by Rachel Miner, is thrown into an artificial ‚Äòconstruct‚Äô where she must put the pieces of her life together and confront the menace that follows her every move. Plot Sarah L. Caul is 24 years old, attractive, skilled in martial arts, and highly intelligent. When the audience first meets her, she has no idea who she is, where she is from, or how she came to be in a white room, in no discernible location. A familiar melody wakes Sarah from a deep sleep, and she finds herself teaching a history class in the school she attended at age 11. The ‚Äòschool‚Äô is revealed to be a replica, and all of Sarah's books and files are completely blank and empty. Now thoroughly confused, Sarah's assistant principal, Sandrine (Terasa Livingstone), explains that Sarah is not a school teacher; rather, she is an assassin, and she has something on her body that Sandrine's government desires. After a deadly shootout and a high speed chase on a cat-walk, Sarah is intercepted by another \\"handler\\" like Sandrine, who tells her the same story, claiming to be from a different country and a different agency, but still desiring the same unknown element. Like Sandrine, once the handler had extracted all of the evidence he could from Sarah, he attempts to kill her. Not able to trust anyone, Sarah spends the duration of her time in the construct trying to stay alive long enough to uncover the truth, and find out why so many people want her dead. She endures a series of wire-fu fights and a car chase while conducting an intense investigation into her past. Sarah eventually finds herself back in the white room where she started, where, before she can be killed, two gunshots are heard and a slow, wobbly figure emerges from the shadows. The figure is revealed to be J. Edgar Hoover (Seymour Cassel), who is very much alive and very happy to see that his granddaughter, Sarah, is doing just fine. Apparently, Hoover was aware that two government factions had ascertained that he was still alive, and he used his granddaughter as bait to flush out these two agencies, thus eliminating them and any proof of his continued existence. Having shared this, Hoover helps Sarah up and dusts her off, and the two walk off into the light. Cast * Rachel Miner as Sarah L. Caul ** Aiden Cree Lafreniere as young Sarah * Jonathan Banks as Trejo * Robert Berson as Prometheus * Sarah Wynter as Eva X * Seymour Cassel as J.

The stunts and fight choreography were arranged by Hong Kong martial artist Xiong Xin Xin. Reception The movie was critically ignored, and was poorly received in its few reviews, despite the mild success elsewhere of some of its actors (Miner went on to have roles in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Californication, and The Black Dahlia, among other productions). One reviewer stated that the film was a \\"directionless jumble of boring scenes strung together tenuously by a plot that feels like they were making it up as they went along,\\" and that watching the film's allegedly ‚Äòwire-fu‚Äô fight scenes was akin to \\"being over at a friend‚Äôs house when they‚Äôre getting yelled at by their parents.\\" See also * Circadian rhythm, the biological cycle for which the film is named References External links * Category:2005 films Category:American films Category:2000s action thriller films Category:American action thriller films ","title":"Circadian Rhythm (film)"},{"id":"4881123","text":"Hofgarten temple and fountain Bavarian Staatskanzlei at top, Munich Residenz on right, temple of Diana at center The Hofgarten (Court Garden) is a garden in the center of Munich, Germany, located between the Residenz and the Englischer Garten. History The garden was built in 1613‚Äì1617 by Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria in the style of Italian Renaissance garden. In the center of the garden is a pavilion for the goddess Diana, built in 1615 by Heinrich Sch√∂n the elder. A path leads from each of the eight arches. On the roof of the Diana pavilion is the replica of a sculpture of Bavaria by Hubert Gerhard, created in 1623. The original is in the Kaisersaal of the Residenz. Facing the Hofgarten on the east side is the Bavarian Staatskanzlei (\\"State Chancellery\\"), housed in the former Army Museum, with the addition of glass wings left and right of the original building. The repurposed building was completed in 1993. A few steps more eastwards the Hofgartenkaserne was located from 1801 to 1899. In front of the Staatskanzlei, the Kriegerdenkmal (\\"war memorial\\") is located, built for commemoration of the Munich people, killed in action in World War I. In the north east corner, a square black granite memorial stands to the White Rose group, whose members were executed for a non violent campaign against Hitler's regime. The Hofgarten is a very popular spot, shown here on the first sunny weekend in spring The south side towards the Residenz includes flowers in a design by Carl Effner from 1853, with arcades to the west and the north, including many wall paintings related to the history of Bavaria. To the west, the Hofgartentor (\\"Court Garden Gate\\") leads towards the Theatinerkirche. Built in 1816, it is the first work in Munich by Leo von Klenze. The garden was destroyed during World War II, and was rebuilt with a partial redesign which compromised between the landscape garden character it had acquired in the nineteenth century and the original formal design of the seventeenth century. Nowadays the garden is open to the public, and is very popular with both residents and tourists alike. The nearest Munich U-Bahn station is Odeonsplatz, located directly west of the garden.

Ascent slows toward the top of the hill, a safety feature that reduces stress on the chain; it is also an attempt to reduce positive g-forces and increases rider anticipation.

Paz saved himself by jumping into the Paran√° River and swimming to the Buenos Aires ships, thus returning to the city of his birth. In Buenos Aires Paz enlisted in the Buenos Aires forces commanded by Bartolom√© Mitre and in 1860 he distinguished himself at his young age at the Battle of Pav√≥n. At the end of the war he decided to enter politics, and worked for the party of Adolfo Alsina and began studies in law. In 1865, during the War of the Triple Alliance, he founded the Society for the Protection of Invalids, a corps of nurses to treat the injured that arrived at the Port of Buenos Aires and move them to the Hospice for Invalids, also founded by Paz. To pay for the costs of these organisations, he set up a newspaper, El inv√°lido argentino. On 18 October 1869 he founded La Prensa. In 1871, Paz decided to organise a charity to help those suffering from yellow fever. That year the newspaper's chief reporter fell sick with yellow fever and Paz had him cared for at his own house. In the 1874 revolution, Paz found himself on the side of Mitre once again. He was forced to live in exile in Montevideo, where he completed his studies in law. He returned to Argentina and became a national deputy in 1879. He resigned his seat to become diplomatic representative to Madrid 1883-85, then to Paris 1885-1893. Paz returned to Argentina to manage the newspaper, and, though he relocated to Monte Carlo in 1900, he commissioned the building of a palace in the Retiro area of Buenos Aires. Designed by French architect Louis Sortais, the Paz Palace was begun in 1902 and completed in 1914. The Palace runs along the south west side of Plaza San Mart√≠n in downtown Buenos Aires and, housing over 6,000 m2 (65,000 ft2) of space, it remains the largest single house ever built in Argentina. Its construction, however, outlived Paz, who died in Monaco in 1912. He was placed in a grand mausoleum in La Recoleta Cemetery,El C√≠rculo Militar: 100 a√±os despues. Secretar√≠a de Informaci√≥n P√∫blica, 1981. with a sculpture by French artist Jules-Felix Coutan. Paz was featured on an Argentinian post stamp.

Life and career  Flahavan played for the Southampton youth team, before turning professional with Portsmouth at age 18 in 1994. He had to wait until 1996 before making his first-team debut as he was understudy to long-serving Alan Knight. Towards the end of the 1990s, Flahavan gradually began receiving increased playing time, and became the team's first-choice goalkeeper by the time Knight retired in 2000. Overall, he played 105 first-team matches for Portsmouth, 93 of them in Division One, and was part of the team which reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the 1996-97 season and just missed out on the Division One playoffs. Flahavan twice had blackouts during matches; the first was attributed to a virus, and the second to a drop in his blood pressure.  Death  Flahavan died in a car accident near Bournemouth in August 2001. An inquest heard that Flahavan died as a result of a fractured skull, and his blood alcohol level was nearly three times over the legal limit when he lost control of his BMW sports car. Following his death, Portsmouth and Southampton retired his number 1 jersey for the 2001‚Äì02 season as a mark of respect.  Family  Flahavan's younger brother, Darryl, also played as a goalkeeper, and had a spell at Aaron's former club Portsmouth between 2010 and 2011. Darryl has a son named Aaron in memory of his brother.

Burning of the B√∂√∂gg Following the parade of the Z√ºnfte (guilds), the climax of the holiday is the burning of Winter in effigy, in the form of the B√∂√∂gg, a figure of a snowman prepared with explosives. The custom of burning a rag doll called B√∂√∂gg predates the Sechsel√§uten. A B√∂√∂gg (cognate to bogey) was originally a masked character doing mischief and frightening children during the carnival season. History Burning the B√∂√∂gg around 1900 The roots of the festival go back to medieval times when the first day of summer working hours was celebrated in the guildhalls across the city. City ordinances strictly regulated the length of the working day in that era. During the winter semester the workday in all workshops lasted as long as there was daylight, but during the summer semester (i.e. starting on Monday following vernal equinox) the law proclaimed that work must cease when the church bells tolled at six o'clock. Sechsel√§uten is a Swiss German word that literally translates into \\"The six o'clock ringing of the bells\\". Changing to summer working hours traditionally was a joyous occasion because it marked the beginning of the season where people had some non-working daylight hours. Burnings of B√∂√∂gg figures (the Swiss German term for \\"bogey\\", in origin scary- looking ragdolls) in spring are attested in various places of the city from the late 18th and early 19th century, without direct connection to the Sechsel√§uten. The combination of the Sechsel√§uten parade and the burning of an official B√∂√∂gg was introduced in 1902. From 1902 until 1951, the holiday used to be held on the first Monday following vernal equinox. On that day, the Fraum√ºnster bell, for the first time in the year, tolled to mark the end of working hours at 6 p.m. (historically the time of sunset on vernal equinox). The holiday was moved to the third Monday of April in 1952. Because of the later date, and because of summer time introduced in 1981, the lighting of the B√∂√∂gg's pyre at 6 p.m. has now moved to several hours before nightfall. Additionally, because of its present date, the holiday is often within a week of 1 May, leading to a stark contrast between the upper class dominated Sechsel√§uten and the working class holiday of May Day. This proximity of the major festivals of two political poles of the society of Z√ºrich has led to various interferences in the past, for example the abduction of the B√∂√∂gg in 2006 by leftist \\"revolutionaries\\" a few days before the Sechsel√§uten. Since then, several B√∂√∂ggs are held in reserve with the main one stored at a bank nearby the Sechsel√§utenplatz (the open area in front of the Opernhaus near Bellevue where most Z√ºrich open air activities take place). Since 2010 the guilds of Z√ºrich allow the women of Gesellschaft zu Fraum√ºnster to practice Sechsel√§uten, usually just being guests of the guilds respectively the Constaffel society, but still not being as an official guild in Z√ºrich. In 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Sechsel√§uten parade, that was supposed to occur on 20th April, was cancelled for that year. This was the first time in almost 100 years that the paraded did not happen. It is expected the Sechsel√§uten parade, will operate normally from the next year, 19th April, 2021. Weather oracle Popular tradition has it that the time between the lighting of the pyre and the explosion of the B√∂√∂gg‚Äôs head is indicative of the coming summer: a quick explosion promises a warm, sunny summer, a drawn- out burning a cold and rainy one. The shortest time on record is 5:07 minutes in 1974 and the longest is 43:34 minutes in 2016.https://web.archive.org/web/20160116230414/http://www.sechselaeuten.ch/sechselaeuten/statistik.asp The 2007 explosion of the B√∂√∂gg‚Äôs head (on 16 April 2007) took place 12:09 minutes after the pyre was lit, promising a medium warm summer. On 14 April 2008, heavy rains soaked the B√∂√∂gg and the wood pyre materials so much that \\"firemen\\" in the style of Fahrenheit 451 had to spray the pyre with kerosene or fuel oil after initial ignition in addition to 15 liters of fire accelerant which was initially thrown on the pyre. It took 26:01 minutes for the B√∂√∂ggs head to explode which indicates a poor weather summer. =Sechsel√§uten in recent years= The Sechsel√§uten of 2008 took place on 14 April. Officially, the head exploded only after 26 minutes and one second, promising a rather poor summer. The fact that the head, instead of traditionally exploding, burnt down very quietly caused a lot of confusion. After approximately 20 minutes the head had burnt away completely, but leaving a large piece of the neck hanging from the stake. It was the explosion of that piece that ended this year's event. In 2012, it took 12 minutes and 07 seconds, and in this year there was some confusion if both firecrackers in the neck of the B√∂√∂gg had exploded. It was determined that 12 min 07 secs was the mark. In 2014, the head exploded quite quickly (7 Minutes and 23 seconds) but it ended up being a poor summer. In 2015, the head exploded quite quickly and it ended up being a very good summer. In 2016, the head exploded after 43 minutes and 34 seconds, setting a new record. In 2017, the head exploded after 9 minutes and 56 seconds. A quick time and there was a good summer In 2018, the head exploded after 20 minutes and 31 seconds. In 2019, the head exploded after 17 minutes and 44 seconds. In 2020, Sechsel√§uten was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional events Additional events of the holiday nowadays also include: #A 'Kinderumzug' (children's parade) in historic and folkloristic costumes on the Sunday preceding the Sechsel√§uten. #A very colorful afternoon parade of the 26 guilds in their historic dress costumes, each with its own band, most with a sizable mounted 'Reitergruppe', and horse drawn floats, to the 'Sechsel√§utenplatz' at the lakeshore where the B√∂√∂gg is burnt. #A ceremonial galloping of the mounted units of the guilds around the bonfire. #Lunch and dinner banquets for the guildmembers and their guests. #The 'Auszug', the nighttime visits of delegations of each of the 26 guilds to several other guilds in their guildhalls to exchange greetings, toasts, witticisms and gifts.  Sechsel√§utenmarsch  During this festival the popular march known as the Sechsel√§utenmarsch is played. It has no known composer but likely originated in Russia.

To this end, the Society was jointly responsible, with the Conference of Socialist Economists, Tony Benn and the Campaign Group of Labour MPs, for the initiation of a series of conferences between 1987 and 1992 which were held in Chesterfield, Sheffield or Manchester and the subsequent founding of the Socialist Movement. The Society was opposed to Euroscepticism, committed to electoral reform and open to green ideas, all of which were fairly controversial on the left at the time.

White and Resa A. Roth (2009). Exploratory Search: Beyond the Query-Response Paradigm, San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool. * unfamiliar with the domain of their goal (i.e. need to learn about the topic in order to understand how to achieve their goal) or * unsure about the ways to achieve their goals (either the technology or the process) or * unsure about their goals in the first place. Exploratory search is distinguished from known-item search, for which the searcher has a particular target in mind. Consequently, exploratory search covers a broader class of activities than typical information retrieval, such as investigating, evaluating, comparing, and synthesizing, where new information is sought in a defined conceptual area; exploratory data analysis is another example of an information exploration activity. Typically, therefore, such users generally combine querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation. History Exploratory search is a topic that has grown from the fields of information retrieval and information seeking but has become more concerned with alternatives to the kind of search that has received the majority of focus (returning the most relevant documents to a Google-like keyword search). The research is motivated by questions like \\"what if the user doesn't know which keywords to use?\\" or \\"what if the user isn't looking for a single answer?\\". Consequently, research has begun to focus on defining the broader set of information behaviors in order to learn about the situations when a user is, or feels, limited by only having the ability to perform a keyword search. In the last few years, a series of workshops has been held at various related and key events. In 2005, the Exploratory Search Interfaces workshop focused on beginning to define some of the key challenges in the field. Since then a series of other workshops has been held at related conferences: Evaluating Exploratory Search at SIGIR06 and Exploratory Search and HCI at CHI07 (in order to meet with the experts in human‚Äìcomputer interaction). In March 2008, an Information Processing and Management special issueRyen W. White, Gary Marchionini, Gheorghe Muresan (2008). Evaluating exploratory search systems: Introduction to special topic issue of information processing and management Vol. 44, Issue 2, (2008), pp. 433‚Äì436 focused particularly on the challenges of evaluating exploratory search, given the reduced assumptions that can be made about scenarios of use. In June 2008, the National Science Foundation sponsored an invitational workshop to identify a research agenda for exploratory search and similar fields for the coming years. Research challenges =Important scenarios= With the majority of research in the information retrieval community focusing on typical keyword search scenarios, one challenge for exploratory search is to further understand the scenarios of use for when keyword search is not sufficient. An example scenario, often used to motivate the research by mSpace,mSpace states: if a user does not know much about classical music, how should they even begin to find a piece that they might like. Similarly, for patients or their carers, if they don't know the right keywords for their health problems, how can they effectively find useful health information for themselves? =Designing new interfaces= With one of the motivations being to support users when keyword search is not enough, some research has focused on identifying alternative user interfaces and interaction models that support the user in different ways. An example is faceted search which presents diverse category-style options to the users, so that they can choose from a list instead of guess a possible keyword query. Many of the interactive forms of search, including faceted browsers, are being considered for their support of exploratory search conditions. Computational cognitive models of exploratory search have been developed to capture the cognitive complexities involved in exploratory search. Model-based dynamic presentation of information cues are proposed to facilitate exploratory search performance.Fu, W.-T., Kannampalill, T. G., & Kang, R. (2010). Facilitating exploratory search by model-based navigational cues. In Proceedings of the ACM International conference on Intelligent User Interface. 199‚Äì208. =Evaluating interfaces= As the tasks and goals involved with exploratory search are largely undefined or unpredictable, it is very hard to evaluate systems with the measures often used in information retrieval. Accuracy was typically used to show that a user had found a correct answer, but when the user is trying to summarize a domain of information, the correct answer is near impossible to identify, if not entirely subjective (for example: possible hotels to stay in Paris). In exploration, it is also arguable that spending more time (where time efficiency is typically desirable) researching a topic shows that a system provides increased support for investigation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, giving study participants a well specified task could immediately prevent them from exhibiting exploratory behavior. =Models of exploratory search behavior= There have been recent attempts to develop a process model of exploratory search behavior, especially in social information system (e.g., see models of collaborative tagging. The process model assumes that user-generated information cues, such as social tags, can act as navigational cues that facilitate exploration of information that others have found and shared with other users on a social information system (such as social bookmarking system). These models provided extension to existing process model of information search that characterizes information-seeking behavior in traditional fact-retrievals using search engines.

Modeling information navigation: Implications for information architecture. Human Computer Interaction, 19, 225‚Äì271. Recent development in exploratory search is often concentrated in predicting users' search intents in interaction with the user. Such predictive user modeling, also referred as intent modeling, can help users to get accustomed to a body of domain knowledge and help users to make sense of the potential directions to be explored around their initial, often vague, expression of information needs.

Jackson was not a candidate for election to fill the vacancy, and was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor of Indiana in 1944.
