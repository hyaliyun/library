Filmmakers Jerry Rothwell and Reuben Atlas debuted the documentary at film festivals in October 2016 and on Netflix the following month.  Premise  Rudy Kurniawan was a rich Indonesian wine collector with a fascination for Burgundy, and he spent millions of dollars on wine and also sold countless bottles of fake wine. Acker Merrall & Condit, an auction company, broke records by selling worth of Kurniawan's wines in 2006 (equivalent to about $M in ). In 2008, the firm held a sale at a Manhattan restaurant, promising the wines would be authenticated by \\"some of Burgundy's most discerning connoisseurs.\\" Included were alleged bottles of Domaine Ponsot Clos Saint-Denis from the years 1945, 1949 and 1966, but an estate proprietor revealed that that particular wine had not been produced until 1982. In 2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Kurniawan's house in Arcadia, Los Angeles and discovered his wine fraud, whereby he collected empty bottles and refilled them with cheaper wine and then forged the labels. In 2014, he became the first person in the United States to be convicted of the crime, and was given a ten-year sentence by a New York federal judge. Kurniawan declined to be interviewed for the documentary.

Unlike the original puzzle (but like the 4√ó4√ó4 and 6√ó6√ó6 cubes), it has no fixed facets: the center facets (36 per face) are free to move to different positions. The design was covered by Panagiotis Verdes' patent from 2007US Patent 20070057455 but Verdes Innovations SA did not produce it for sale until 2014. Other 8√ó8√ó8 cubes are produced by the Chinese companies QiYi, Cyclone Boys, ShengShou, MoYu, and YuXin.8√ó8√ó8-17√ó17√ó17 cubes at The Cubicle Methods for solving the 3√ó3√ó3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 8√ó8√ó8 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colors -- since the center facets can no longer be used for identification.  Mechanics  The puzzle consists of 296 pieces (\\"cubies\\") on the surface. There are also 84 movable pieces entirely hidden within the interior of the cube, as well as six fixed pieces attached to the central \\"spider\\" frame. The V-Cube 9 uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter these hidden pieces (corresponding to the center rows) are made visible. There are 216 center pieces which show one color each, 72 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors. Each piece (or sextet of edge pieces) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the Cube 90¬∞, 180¬∞, or 270¬∞, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces. Currently, the 8√ó8√ó8 is produced with black or white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite white or black. The V-Cube version has one center piece marked the letter V. The V-Cube has rounded sides like the V-Cube 7, whereas the Chinese versions have flat faces. On all versions, the outermost layers are thicker than the middle ones. Without this alteration, there would be no way to connect the corner pieces to the rest of the mechanism. =Permutations= There are 8 corners, 72 edges, and 216 centers. Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!√ó37 combinations. There are 216 centers, consisting of nine sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(246) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of center permutations is the permutations of a single set raised to the ninth power, 24!9/(2454). There are 72 edges, consisting of 24 inner, 24 intermediate, and 24 outer edges. These cannot be flipped (because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical), nor can an edge from one set exchange places with an edge from another set. The six edges in each matching sextet are distinguishable, since corresponding edges are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the edges in each set is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24!3 total, regardless of the position or orientation of any other pieces. Assuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because the 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N√óN√óN cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation. This gives a total number of permutations of :\\\\frac{8! \\\\times 3^7 \\\\times 24!^{12}}{24^{55}} \\\\approx 3.52 \\\\times 10^{217} The entire number is 35 173 780 923 109 452 777 509 592 367 006 557 398 539 936 328 978 098 352 427 605 879 843 998 663 990 903 628 634 874 024 098 344 287 402 504 043 608 416 113 016 679 717 941 937 308 041 012 307 368 528 117 622 006 727 311 360 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000. The V-Cube has one center piece marked with a V, which distinguishes it from the other three in its set. This increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 1.41√ó10218, although any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct. Solutions There are a number of methods that can be used to solve a V-Cube 8. One method is to first group the center pieces of common colors together, then to match up edges that show the same two colors. Once this is done, turning only the outer layers of the cube allows it to be solved like a 3√ó3√ó3 cube. However, certain positions that cannot be solved on a standard 3√ó3√ó3 cube may be reached. For instance, a single sextet of edges may be inverted, or the cube may appear to have an odd permutation (that is, two pieces must be swapped, which is not possible on the 3√ó3√ó3 cube). These situations are known as parity errors, and require special algorithms to be solved.Jaap's puzzle page for the 4√ó4√ó4 cube has algorithms that also apply to the 8√ó8√ó8. Another similar approach to solving this cube is to first pair the edges, and then the centers. This, too, is vulnerable to the parity errors described above. Other methods solve the cube by solving a cross and the centers, but not solving any of the edges and corners not needed for the cross, then the other edges would be placed similar to the 3x3 Fridrich method. Some methods are designed to avoid the parity errors described above. For instance, solving the corners and edges first and the centers last would avoid such parity errors. Once the rest of the cube is solved, any permutation of the center pieces can be solved. Note that it is possible to apparently exchange a pair of face centers by cycling 3 face centers, two of which are visually identical. Records The World Cube Association does not keep records for this puzzle as of 2020.

Hovey House is a private house located at 318 Houston Avenue in Muskegon, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History Horatio N. Hovey was born in 1853 in Oakland County, Michigan. In 1867 the family moved to Muskegon, and Horatio began work in a local grocery store. The next year he began working at the Post Office, where he worked until 1875. That year, using money he had saved, Hovey went into business with Elias W. Merrill, establishing a hardware firm under the name of Merrill and Hovey. In 1881 Hovey partnered with J.B. McCracken to open a sawmill, and the two ran a successful limbering business for the next 18 years. (Note: large pdf file) While working at the post office, Hovey Hovey met Nellie Merrill, daughter of then-Postmaster Elias W. Merrill. The two were married in 1874, and eventually had four children. In 1889, the couple built this Queen Anne house for their family. In November of 1903, Horatio Hovey merged his lumber operations with those of T.C. Starret, and moved his family to Detroit. Hovey sold his house in 1903, after which it was used as a private residence, then as a home for delinquent boys, a dress shop, a restaurant known as the Houston House Restaurant and Banquet Room, and a ladies‚Äô tea room. In 1979, the Hovey House was purchased by Mills Property Management Corporation, and in 1984 the house was restored and converted into office space. In 1998 the house was purchased by Frederick and Ann Bleakley, who opened the Bleakley Law Offices in the building. Description The Horatio N. Hovey House is an asymmetrical two-and-one-half story Queen Anne structure with a rough-faced stone foundation. The front facade has a recessed bay containing the main entrance in the center, a gable-roofed bay to the left, and a rounded tower to the right. A wrap-around porch stretches from the entryway around the tower and along the side of the house. A small porch is above the entryway, and the upper portion of the house has decorative Queen Anne elements including wood shingles and decorative wood panels. The elaborate roofline is formed from a combination of jerkin head, conical, gabled, and hipped roofs, as well as additional brackets, finials. On the interior of the house, the first floor contains a wide center hall, around which are two formal parlors, a library / study, stairs, and dining room. A kitchen, pantry, and other service areas are located at the rear. The second floor has another wide hall, seven bedrooms, and a bath. The third floor has four large rooms. The most notable feature of the hone is the fine woodwork throughout the house. The hallways and major public rooms contain wainscotting with carved insets and moldings. The main stairway features a spoked panel braced between turned balusters. Frames around the windows, doors, and fireplace have elaborately detailed and frames, with a molded and carved top rail.

He later took part in a failed trans-United States attempt, in which he was found to have cheated. Young grew up in Yorkshire, England. In interviews, he alleges he suffered abuse from his father, and that his attempts to cope with this gave him a resilient attitude. He went to an orphanage at the age of eight and then spent four years with foster parents. In 2014, according to Young, on a 20p wager from his girlfriend, he ran two marathons around Richmond Park in 24 hours, though he had undergone no training for distance running. He went on to become a long-distance runner, while still working in a car parts store, and claims to have logged 370 marathons and ultras in a year, amounting to 11,000 miles, although there has been no verification of this claim. Starting in May 2016 he attempted to break the record for the fastest run across the United States. Suspicions arose that he might be cheating, after a fan posted on 7 June that he went to run alongside Young, and could not find him. For five days later in June, a team of volunteers followed Young to observe his pursuit of the record, and noted that he was not performing at the level necessary to beat the record. The group disbanded, with one of its members saying, \\"I do not want to be a party to putting Robert Young in the hospital\\". Young abandoned the project on 20 June in Indianapolis, purportedly due to suffering a fractured toe and cellulitis. Young's sponsor, Skins, commissioned two independent experts from the University of Colorado, Boulder and University of the Free State to track telemetry data and determine if cheating had taken place. The experts reported: \\"The evidence that we reviewed for this investigation indicates that Rob Young received unauthorized assistance in his attempt to run across the United States. We have identified no alternative plausible explanation for the data-of-record other than assistance, most likely in the form of riding in or on a vehicle for large parts of the attempt.\\" References Category:1982 births Category:Athletes from Yorkshire Category:English male marathon runners Category:Living people ","title":"Robert Young (runner)"},{"id":"54011242","text":"Mohammad Dehghan (; born January 1963) is an Iranian conservative politician who is currently a member of Parliament from Chenaran, Torghabeh and Shandiz district.

The quarry, originally known as North Bend Quarries, began operations in 1842. It provided limestone for numerous buildings and structures in Iowa City and elsewhere in the state. The list includes the Old Capital (1842), the foundations for Old Brick Church (1856) and the present Iowa State Capitol (1886) in Des Moines. The exact date that the quarry closed is not known, but because there is no evidence of mechanized techniques to remove stone, it is assumed it closed around the turn of the 20th century. with There is, however, hand tool marks in the remaining stone. From 1874 to 1911 Samuel Calvin, professor of natural history at the State University of Iowa, used the quarry for both research and instruction in geology and paleontology. The limestone here is made up largely of cemented fragments of brachiopods that lived in a shallow tropical sea that covered this area during the Devonian period. There is also evidence of fish teeth and plates in the lower parts of the channel sequence. The preserve is the type locality for ‚ÄúState Quarry Limestone,‚Äù determined by Calvin, and only found in Johnson County, Iowa. The quarry became a historical state preserve in 1969, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

The wind tunnel was then moved to the ICARE Laboratory in Orleans, resulting from the merging of the Aerothermodynamics Laboratory and the LCSR (Combustion and Reactive Systems Laboratory). This facility is part of the experimental plateform FAST (Facilities for Aerothermodynamics & Supersonic Technologies, contact Viviana Lago head of FAST team, viviana.lago@cnrs-orlean.fr) belonging in ICARE Institut from CNRS, Orl√©ans. Technical details PHEDRA is a plasma ground test facility used to simulate low pressure flight conditions in the upper layer of the planetary atmospheres. An arc-jet generator operates in a cylindrical chamber of 1;1 m in diameter and 4.3 m length, pumped with 3 primary pumps and 3 Roots pumps, which capacity (27 000 m3/h) insures a residual pressure ranged between 1 and 100 Pa. Different working gases can be used like Argon, nitrogen, CO2, CH4 Air, allowing the simulation of several planetary entry conditions like earth (80%N2-20%O2), Mars (97%CO2-3%N2) or Titan (99% N2-1% CH4). The advantages of the home-made designed plasma source can be found in the stability of the plasma flow, the high specific enthalpy, up to 50 MJ/kg due to the low mass flow rate and the low rate of contamination which could provides from the erosion of the cathode.

She was infamous for her licentious behaviour and also playing her friends and foes against each other for her personal gains. She was the wife of Moin-ul-Mulk (Mir Mannu), who was Governor of the Subah of Lahore from 1748 to 1753, and who had endeared himself to Ahmed Shah Abdali, the King of Afghanistan. Rise to power In November 1753, Moin-ul-Mulk was killed in a horse accident and his infant son was appointed the Governor of Punjab by the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Mughlani Begum became regent to the infant Governor and garnered all the powers in her hands. She however neglected the affairs of the state and led an amoral life, having illicit affairs with many men. Incensed by this, the Mughal officers threw her out and appointed Mirza Khan in her place. Mughlani sent her uncle to Abdali requesting for help to get back her power. Abdali dispatched a small army to Lahore, captured Mirza Khan, and restored the powers to Mughlani. But soon after, her son died and she lost her powers again. Mughlani now got into a power struggle with her uncle and lost, because the latter had the backing of Abdali's men. Piqued by this, Mughlani sought the help of Imad-ul-mulk, who was the Mughal Wazir in Delhi, and also engaged to Mughlani's daughter Umda Begum. Imad agreed to help by sending his troops, but backed out when he got wind of Mughlani's many illicit liaisons, for he felt this would be a disgrace to his family. He secretly sent a contingent of soldiers to Lahore, who encircled Mughlani's palace and forcibly took her away to Sirhind. Vowing revenge, Mughlani now started making overtures to Ahmed Shah Abdali, promising him a treasure trove in the ancestral palace of her father-n-law, the late Wazir Qamruddin Khan. There were others who conspired against Imad-ul-mulk and invited Abdali to invade Delhi. Abdali picked up the bait and decided to invade Delhi. When the news of the impending invasion reached Imad, he had neither an army nor allies willing to fight for him. In desperation he sought peace and sent Mughlani, most ironically, as his envoy to Abdali to stop the invasion. Mughlani tried to 'convince' Abdali to turn back, but he refused since he was already on the doorstep of Delhi. Mughlani sent a secret note to Imad, asking him to flee to a safe place, if he did not have the stomach to fight Abdali. Imad finally surrendered and was stripped of all his powers and wealth. Abdali systematically plundered the city of Delhi, Mughlani pointing out the wealthy people, for which she was rewarded with titles and land. When Abdali retreated to Afghanistan with his loot, the estates were taken away from Mughlani. She was offered a pension, which she haughtily refused and lived in Lahore in poverty.

Malting Institute in Brno is a workplace specialized in the evaluation of barley and malt quality of beer in the Czech Republic. It is headquartered in Brno.  History  Before the First World War, the most commercial and brewing malthouses in the Austro-Hungarian Empire were concentrated in Moravia and Bohemia. The Moravian malthouses used services of the Vienna laboratory Institut f√ºr G√§rungsindustrie of prof. E. Jalowetz (1862 - 1936). After the First World War, the Czechoslovak Malting Commission in Brno was founded; the Commission initiated the establishment of the Institute of the Malting Industry. The task of setting up the institute was assumed by Vladim√≠r Vav≈ôin ≈Ωila (1889-1953), the graduate from the Wiener Akademie f√ºr Brau-Industrie. V. V. ≈Ωila managed the Institute of the Malting Industry from its establishment, at first as a head of the laboratory and lately, to his death, as a director. The ‚ÄùState Research Institute of Fermentation Industry‚Äù connected with the ‚ÄúResearch Institute of Malting Industry‚Äú was established at Czech University of Technology (today Brno University of Technology) by the decree of the Ministry of School and Education on August 4, 1920. On August 4, 1920 the Institute of Malting Industry started conducting analytical checks of the first samples in a makeshift laboratory (7 Falkensteinerova, today 7 Gork√©ho). At the same time the laboratory was awarded the state authorization. In mid 1921 the Institute moved to its own premises in the chemical pavilion of Czech University of Technology (17 Za √∫vozem, today 17 ≈Ωi≈ækova).  Activities  During 1925 ‚Äì 1932, the Institute organized ‚ÄúMalting and Brewing Conventions‚Äú. It had its own display within the Exhibition of Contemporary Culture in Czechoslovakia (1928) and also helped organize the Exhibition of Malting and Brewing, which was part of a large Exhibition of Modern Commerce (1929). In 1933, the pilot experimental malthouse was set up. In the period of 1932-1936 the Institute organized the ‚ÄúMoravian Malting School in Brno‚Äú and in 1935 ‚Äì 1939 the journal ‚ÄúReports of the Institute for the Fermentation Industry‚Äú was published. The Institute continued in its activities throughout the whole war period. In the effort to strengthen Czech malting and brewing community from professional and national aspects, ≈Ωila‚Äôs edition of brewing papers was founded. Four monographs were published in this edition during the occupation. Continuous flow analyzer used for segmented flow analysis of beta- glucans, diastatic power, and free alpha-amino nitrogens  After Liberation  After 1946, the Institute started to develop its activities again. With the support of Prvn√≠ brnƒõnsk√° stroj√≠rna (First Brno Engineering Plant) an experimental brewery for 8 hl was built. At the same time an experimental microbrewery for 30 liters was set up. By the decree of the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences, the Institute was included in the sector of the Ministry of Food Industry with the effect from January 1, 1951. The staff of the Institute thus lost the opportunity to participate in the education of university students. In 1951, the building of Dr. Edvard Bene≈° Technical University where the Institute had its seat, was handed over to the Military Technical Academy. The Malting Institute had to move out in 1952 to buildings after the nationalized company DIMO (7 Mosteck√°, Brno) where it has its seat till today. Neither the experimental brewery nor the pilot experimental malthouse could be moved to new premises. As of January 1, 1952 the ‚ÄúResearch Institute of Brewing and Malting‚Äù (RIBM) was set up by the Ministry of Food Industry. The Institute incorporated workplaces of the Research Institute of Brewing and Malting in Prague, Microbiological Stations at the experimental brewery in Bran√≠k and the workplace of the Research Institute of Fermentation Industry in Brno. Thus, since 1952, history of the above listed workplaces is common. Micromalting plant for production of small malt samples for their subsequent analyses.  Present Days  The Malting Institute became the RIBM‚Äôs Brno workplace specialized in the evaluation of barley and malt quality. In 2000 the original name of the workplace again appears in its name ‚ÄúAnalytical Testing Laboratory ‚Äì Malting Institute Brno‚Äú (registration number 1309.2). Since 1998, ‚ÄúBarley Year Book‚Äù has been published in the RIBM‚Äôs Brno workplace each year. It brings information on barley varieties, statistical data on barley and malt, malthouses directory etc. In 2005-2006, the Brno workplace was completely reconstructed and modernized. In 2015, the ‚ÄúLibrary of Barley and Malt‚Äú was set up. The Czech malting and brewing industry supports research projects ‚ÄúThe evaluation of malting barley varieties‚Äú and ‚ÄúThe evaluation of malting barley quality‚Äú, which have been mostly executed in the RIBM‚Äôs Brno workplace. Based on the results of three-year tests, the RIBM‚Äôs Brno workplace recommends the varieties of spring barley for production of beer with the protected geographical indication ‚Äúƒåesk√© pivo‚Äú (Czech Beer).

It is one of the oldest scientific research institutes in the Central European region. History  On 19 December 1886, the Union for the Establishment and Maintenance of the Research Institute for Brewing Industry in Prague was founded by the General Meeting held in the rooms of the Malting School in Prague. At the beginning of December, the Institute already seated at 871/26 Senov√°≈æn√© Square, Prague. The Institute officially started its activity at the beginning of 1888. In July 1888, the Institute organized the first course for microscopy. In 1891, the Institute took part in the Jubilee Exhibition in Prague. The reference laboratory for brewers, iodine method (for malt saving), certificates, pure yeast and wall-boards were exhibited. In 1893, the Institute moved to new offices in 1762/5 P≈°trossova Street in Prague, New Town. In 1896, the director of the Copenhagen Institute, Alfred J√∏rgensen, donated a collection of microorganisms to the research institute. In April 1897, the Institute moved to new offices in White Swan Brewery in Prague Na Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ 1068/21 where it remained for next 40 years. In the school year 1910/1911, a higher brewing school was opened at the Research Institute. In 1912, the Ministry of Public Works granted the Research Institute the right to issue malting and brewing certificates. In summer 1914, the Institute was restructured, the activities of both schools, the Union and the Research Institute were terminated. A new organization called the Society for the Maintenance of Scientific Institutes for the Brewing Industry in Prague was founded by the General Meeting held on September 13, 1914. As of October 1, 1914, the Research Institute, schools and the laboratory were renamed to the Scientific Brewing Institutes in Prague with the seat at 1068/21 Na Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠. The Ministry of Public Works confirmed the transfer of authorization to the newly renamed Institute. In August 1920, from the initiative of Professor Franti≈°ek Duch√°ƒçek (1875 ‚Äì 1931) and Vladim√≠r Vav≈ô√≠n ≈Ωila (1889 ‚Äì 1953), the State Research Institute of the Fermentation Industry at the Czech Technical University was founded in Brno. Its Malting Department (Malting Institute) began to operate on August 4, 1920. At the meeting of the Directorate of the Scientific Brewing Institutes held on May 17, 1936, a proposal was made to buy together with the Union on the Protection of Breweries in Bohemia (a building in Prague 2, on the corner of Jeƒçn√° and Lipov√° Streets No. 611/15 (U Pokorn√Ωch). The old building was demolished and construction of the Brewery Hall for the needs of both organizations and for rent began in the same year. The project was designed by architect Gustav Paul. The Brewery Hall is a functional six-storey corner building with a short arcade. The reinforced concrete construction was performed by K. Skorkovsky, construction and craft works were carried out by V. Nekvasil. The entrance to the building was situated from Lipov√° Street, the gateway from Jeƒçn√° Street. In April 1937, the building was completed and handed over to use. The Scientific Institutes moved into the building during June and July of the same year. The building has been the seat of the RIBM till today. In 1951, within the post-war reorganization of the educational system, the educational activities of the Institute were terminated. As of January 1, 1962, the Prague Institute of the Brewing and Malting Industry, the microbiological station at the experimental brewery in Bran√≠k and the Research Institute of the Fermentation Industry in Brno were merged under the Research Institute of Brewing and Malting. In 1962, the Institute was extended by the Experimental and Development Centre. In 1965, the Institute became part of the newly created Trust of Breweries and Malt Houses Prague (later the Concern). After 1989, the whole Concern was transformed into the state company Breweries and Malt Houses, Research and Services. In the first half of the 1990s, the whole service company was privatized to a joint-stock company, which in 1994 was again renamed to the Research Institute of Brewing and Malting (RIBM). At that time the Institute had two directors: Managing Director of the joint-stock company, Mr. Jan Vesel√Ω, and the Director of the RIBM, Tom√°≈° Lejsek, who was responsible for research. The RIBM is a member of the Czech Beer and Malt Association. In spring 1996, Karel Kosa≈ô was appointed as the head of the company, he subsequently cancelled the office of the Managing Director. In 2019 Karel Kosa≈ô retired. New director became prof. Ing. Tom√°≈° Br√°nyik, Ph.D., known expert and educator who worked at the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague. He is a graduate of Fermentation Chemistry and Bioengineering and was appointed as professor of biotechnology in 2016.

It consists of two workplaces. The Brno workplace (7 Mosteck√°) houses the Analytical Testing Laboratory of the Malting Institute Brno; the Analytical Testing Laboratory of the Brewing Institute Prague is part of the Prague workplace (15 L√≠pov√°). Both analytical testing laboratories are accredited by the Czech Accreditation Institute, o.p.s. according to the ƒåSN EN ISO/IEC 17025: 2005. Research priorities Characteristics, development and selection of barley and hop varieties on the basis of latest knowledge about the characters of these raw materials for the production of Czech Beer Due to the necessity of a successive exchange of malting barley varieties and the acquisition of specific clones of hops, it is necessary to monitor them from the early breeding stages to their application in practice and their evaluation by the standard and new analytical methods. The aim is to extend the existing knowledge about the analytical and biochemical characters of barley and hop varieties and bring further information that would deepen the evaluation of the varieties for the production and specific quality of beer with the protected geographical indication ‚Äúƒåesk√© pivo‚Äù (Czech Beer). RIBM is the only organization that recommends the raw materials for ƒåesk√© pivo. Within this research area the Institute closely cooperates with the Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture in Brno. Assessment of the suitability of the original yeast strains used for variants of the Czech Beer production technology in Czech breweries The aim is to characterize the strains in the RIBM Collection (more than 100; 5 used in practice), the gradual reproduction of the selected archived original strains and the assessment of their suitability for the current and developed variants of the Czech Beer production technology. Specification of the influence of genetic and technological properties of these strains on the sensory and analytical characteristics of Czech Beer. Expanding knowledge about the specific Czech Beer characteristics The basic characterization of the analytical and sensory differences between Czech and foreign beers was performed by the RIBM in the period of 1999 and 2008. Thanks to this, it was possible to document the basic specific characters of Czech Beer (thermal products, oils, sensory active polyphenols and other substances). The presence and content of these substances can also serve as a marker that clearly distinguishes Czech Beer from foreign beers. Research into characters of Czech Beer with positive and risky effects on health Current knowledge confirms favourable characters of Czech Beer. Modern methods allow to determine more precisely the content and effects of substances with positive health characters, such as the antioxidant properties of polyphenol compounds and also some products of the thermic action of technological processes or in Czech Beers due to higher hopping, higher levels of specific compounds originating from hops and certain hop products. However, in addition to gradual monitoring of the occurrence of beneficial substances, it is also necessary to monitor the occurrence of risk compounds or problematic substances such as heavy metals, spraying residues, etc., to determine their concentration during technological variants of malt and beer production and to ensure the performance of clinical tests. Development of technologies and recipes for the processing of malted traditional and non-traditional cereals, new use of hops, yeast and other production microorganisms for functional foods and beverages with health benefits The research in this field leads towards expanding the portfolio of products of the malting and brewing industry, production of beverages, foods and food supplements based on raw materials and extracts enriched with substances from malt and hops with health benefits and fermentation of beverages by microorganisms producing substances with health benefits. Development of procedures for the processing and utilization of wastes from malting, brewing and other food industry productions New possibilities of biotechnological reprocessing of by-products (waste) of malting and brewing production to components of food, feed, pharmacologically active substances and energy sources are explored. The aim is to reduce existing inefficient use and to develop waste recovery practices within the sustainable development of the sector. Development of new products and innovation of production processes of small and medium-sized breweries and malt houses The aim of the research is to improve production practices, technology processes, quality assurance systems and health product safety, and develop new beer brands for specific industrial users.

Collection of brewery yeast The collection of brewery yeast is run by the staff of the microbiological department. It was created in 1946 as part of the collection of yeast and yeast microorganisms under the guidance of Dr. Kockov√°-Kratochv√≠lov√°, since 1953 it is an independent section. Since 1964, the collection has been a member of the Federation of Czech and Slovak Collections of Microorganisms, it is internationally registered under the name RIBM number 655. With its focus on brewery yeast production strains, the RIBM Collection is unique in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1996, the Collection of Brewery Yeast (as one of the highly specialized and industrially applicable collections) became part of the \\"National programme on protection of genetic resources of economically significant microorganisms and tiny animals‚Äú and their use in reference diagnostics. This project is also supported by the Czech Government in the form of subsidies from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic. The program is run by the Council of Genetic Resources of Microorganisms, which monitors the binding preservation of the functional existence of the collections of microorganisms of the corresponding character. The collection consists of two types of brewery yeast production strains, which, according to the classification of Kurtzmann and Fell, 1998, belong to species Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The essential part of the collection consists of the bottom fermenting strains Saccharomyces pastorianus (S. carlsbergensis). Upper fermenting yeast S. cerevisiae is less represented. The collection is continuously replenished and currently it contains more than 100 strains. The individual yeast strains come from the existing and already non-existing mainly European breweries. The parallel collection includes \\"wild\\" microorganisms contains several tens of yeast strains of the genus Saccharomyces, Torulaspora, Zygosaccharomyces, Dekker, Williopsis, Pichia, Schizosaccharomyces, Saccharomycodes, Candida, Kloecker, and Rhodotorula. bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Tetragenococcus, Lactococcus, Pectinatus, and Megasphaera. The collections of brewery and wild yeast are kept on wort agar under the waxed cotton wool plug and simultaneously on wort agar coated with sterile paraffin oil separately in a cooling box. These proven methods of keeping cultures enable the strain to be delivered quickly and in an active state on a sloppy agar, possibly fermented to 1.5 l of wort, this allows the transfer of the production strain to production. Since 2006, brewery yeast strains have been stored in cryogenic tubes with a protective medium in liquid nitrogen at -196 ¬∞C. Storage in liquid nitrogen (cryopreservation) is considered to be an optimal way of long-term storage of the yeast in a viable state. Sensory Research Centre The Sensory Research Centre in Prague was opened in October 2014, it was established as project no. CZ.2.16/3.1.00/28030 of the Operational Program Prague - Competitiveness The Sensory Research Centre consists of two laboratories: sensory and analytical. By connecting these laboratories with the already existing analytical and technological equipment of the Institute, a unique unit suitable for comprehensive industrial research and development in the area of foodstuff with a focus on beer and other beverages was created. Besides research activities, regular events for the professional public are also held at the centre. The Sensory Seminar I was drafted in accordance with the standard ƒåSN ISO 8586 \\"Sensory Analysis - General Guidelines for the Selection, Training and Monitoring of Assessors' Activity\\" and the EBC Analysis, Chapter \\"Sensory Analysis - Selection and Training of the Assessors\\". The aim of the seminar is to teach the participants to taste the beer correctly. The seminar includes theoretical lectures and practical degustation and is accomplished with a practical test. Sensory Seminar II. serves to repeat, deepen, expand and, most importantly, to practice regularly the sensory assessment of beer. This seminar contains one extra lecture focusing on the overview and basic sensory characteristics of a number of foreign beers (Lagers, Ale, Stout, Porter, etc.), which are increasingly popular in our market. However, most of the time of the seminar is devoted to practical training. Sensory tests are conducted according to the standard ƒåSN ISO 8586 \\"Sensory Analysis - General Guidelines for the Selection, Training and Monitoring of the Assessors' Activity\\" and the EBC Analysis, Chapter \\"Sensory Analysis - Selection and Training of the Assessors\\". The aim is to verify participants' ability to perform sensory assessment of beer at professional level; successful candidates are awarded a certificate valid for 5 years. Sensory trainings are held for the closed brewing groups. The scope and selection of the tastes and flavours is based on the customer's wishes. Commercial activity The RIBM performs a number of commercial activities, namely in the brewing and malting area: * Analyses of brewing and malting raw materials, intermediaries and final products and other agricultural commodities; * Technological consultation; * Sale of finished products (brewery yeast, wort concentrate); * Production and publication of statistical overviews on production in the brewing and malting industry and non-alcoholic beverages in the CR.

He served as president of the (L√ºbeck based) High Appeal Court of the Four Free Cities for more than three decades and is identified in certain academic circles as a leading representative of the 19th century German Historical School of Jurisprudence.  Life  Georg Arnold Heise was born in Hamburg. He was the eldest of his parents' nine recorded children: after his mother died in 1801 his father remarried and a further three children appeared. His father; Johann Ludwig Barthold Heise (1749-1812), was a Hamburg merchant who lost his wealth thanks to the ruinous economic impact of the world war (as it was frequently known at the time). The father had to abandon his business in 1799 and take employment as a legally authorized agent (\\"Bevollm√§chtigter\\") with an asset management company. Heise's mother, born Maria Anna Behrmann, came from a major Hamburg mercantile family. Initially Heise was schooled at home, alongside his younger brothers. An early tutor was Paul Lorenz Cropp, a Lutheran pastor and the father of Friedrich Cropp who subsequently became Heise's colleague and a personal friend. Later he attended the commercially oriented secondary school run by Johann Georg B√ºsch, concluding his schooling at a Hamburg Gymnasium (secondary school). Sources suggest that early on he aspired to a career as an engineer, but because of his diminutive stature this was felt to be impractical. Instead, encouraged by his uncle, the Hamburg Senator (and later city mayor) Arnold Heise, he decided to study Jurisprudence (as his uncle had done) at university. In 1798 he enrolled at the University of Jena where he became part of a network of students who would continue as friends throughout their - in several instances notable - careers. A couple of years after this he transferred to G√∂ttingen which is where, early in 1802, he received his doctorate for a dissertation on laws governing inheritance, entitled \\"de successoribus necessariis\\". Directly after receiving his doctorate, in March 1802 he took teaching work at G√∂ttingen's \\"Spruchcollegium\\" where, starting after Easter 1803, he worked as a lecturer on contract and civil law. As matters turned out he did not stay at G√∂ttingen for long. The lecture topics were chosen more as a result of academic necessity than as any reflection of his own particular inclinations, but his lectures were nevertheless well received, so that early in 1804 he found himself with a professorship at Jena. In the summer of the same year, through the intervention of Friedrich Carl von Savigny, one of his university friends, Heise received and accepted an invitation to become a visiting professor in church law at Heidelberg University in the summer of 1804. During the ten years that he now spent at Heidelberg, Heise established for himself a reputation for academic brilliance, both through his teaching and through specialist articles and other written work. He also played a central role in building up the law department at the university in the face of widespread economic challenges resulting from the war. Directly before settling in Heidelberg, however, he married Sophia Georgina Elisabeth \\"Betty\\" Isenbart, the daughter of a colonel from Hanover whom he had met in the house of his friend Christoph Martin. In 1814 he returned from Heidelberg to G√∂ttingen, taking a post as Professor of Roman Law. He enjoyed great success as a teacher of Pandectic and Commercial law. At the same time, following moves towards standardisation of laws under Napoleon, the future of the legal underpinnings and structures were subjects of intense and at times polarised discussion, reflecting the rapid political, economic and social changes of the period: Heise's published contributions were increasingly acknowledged by supporters and opponents alike in academic and legal circles. Nevertheless, he stayed at G√∂ttingen only for four years before moving again, towards the end of 1818, this time to his wife's home city of Hanover. He now gave up teaching and embarked on a new career in public service, taking a job as a senior advocate (\\"Vortragender Rat\\") in the regional justice department. G√∂ttingen University had recently been granted the right to nominate member of parliament. In 1819 Heise was nominated by the university as a member of the lower chamber of the parliament/legislative assembly of the kingdom. However, he had already let it be known that were the opportunity to arise he would welcome the chance to move back to his own home city, Hamburg, where following the ending of the French occupation, restructuring of the political and legal systems was also very much on the agenda. Article 12 (Section 3) of the 1815 constitution had provided for the right of the \\"four free cities to establish a joint high court\\".Den vier freyen St√§dten steht das Recht zu, sich untereinander √ºber die Errichtung eines gemeinsamen obersten Gerichts zu vereinigen.\\" The \\"free cities\\" in question were Bremen, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg and L√ºbeck. After a certain amount of jostling between the politicians involved, the High Appeal Court of the Four Free Cities was established in L√ºbeck in 1820. With effect from its inauguration on 12 November 1820, Georg Arnold Heise accepted the invitation to become the court's first president. The court endured for nearly sixty years, replaced only in 1879 under the provisions of the State Justice Laws of 1877, enacted in the aftermath of unification. Heise was in charge of it for slightly more than half of the period covered by its existence. Under his leadership its reputation grew within and beyond the \\"four free cities\\", as it was appointed to arbitrate in cases involving intergovernmental disputes between other component states of the German Confederation.  Significance  The distinguished jurist Bernhard Windscheid wrote later than for an ambitious [German] jurist of Heise's generation there were really only two jobs to covet. One was to succeed Savigny, who was central to the establishment of a modern legal system in Prussia, and the other, in Windscheid's opinion, would be to take on Heise's job.\\"... es hat damals f√ºr das Streben wissenschaftlicher Juristen zwei h√∂chste Ehren gegeben: Nachfolger Savignys auf seinem Pandektenlehrstuhl und Pr√§sident des Oberappellationsgerichts in L√ºbeck an Heises Stelle zu sein,\\" Many of the court decisions under Heise's presidency developed commercial law decisively, and in some cases achieved lasting influence as precedents. Heise's influence as an academic lawyer reached far beyond his own students thanks, in large measure, to the influence of his written work. This is particularly the case with his much re-printed Pandectist lectures.  Output (selection)  * Grundri√ü eines Systems des allgemeinen Civilrechts zum Behuf von Pandekten-Vorlesungen.

The operation was carried out by members of a regimental task group, made up of a tactical HQ, members of A Squadron (A Sqn) and G Squadron (G Sqn) of the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment (22 SAS), supported by United States (US) forces, on an al-Qaeda-linked opium plant during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan at the start of Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Afghanistan (OEF-A).Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp.69-72, p.73 Background Following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US by al-Qaeda, the US and the United Kingdom (UK) began the invasion of Afghanistan on 7 October 2001, to dismantle and destroy al-Qaeda and to deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power. In mid-October 2001, A Sqn and G Sqn of 22 SAS, reinforced by members of the Territorial Army SAS regiments, deployed to north west Afghanistan in support of OEF-A under the command of United States Central Command (CENTCOM). They conducted largely uneventful reconnaissance tasks under the codename Operation Determine, none of these tasks resulted in enemy contact; after a fortnight and with missions drying up both squadrons returned to their barracks in the UK.Finlan, Alastair , Special Forces, Strategy and the War on Terror: Warfare By Other Means (Cass Military Studies) , Routledge, 2009 =Prelude= After political intersession with Prime minister Tony Blair, the SAS were given a direct-action task ‚Äì the destruction of an al-Qaeda-linked opium processing plant. The facility was located southwest of Kandahar at the foot of the Koh-I-Malik mountain, north of the Pakistan border, the facility was made up of a system of houses, compounds and caves, with defences consisting of trench lines and several makeshift bunkers-manned by between 80 and 100 foreign fighters mostly from al-Qaeda. Intelligence indicated that some of the terrorists guarding the facility were well armed and trained at one of al-Qaeda's top training camps and that their morale would be high. It was being used as a headquarters and a staging post for al-Qaeda and the Taliban for getting drugs and equipment across the border into Pakistan, it was also an Opium factory. In mid-November 2001, A and G squadron 22 SAS were covertly re-inserted into Bagram Airfield under the codename Operation Blood to carry out the assault.Cawthorne, Nigel, Heroes on the Front Line: True Stories of the Deadliest Missions Behind Enemy Lines in Afghanistan and Iraq, John Blake, 2011, , p.73 The SAS were ordered to assault the facility in full daylight: the timelines had been mandated by CENTCOM and were based on the availability of air support assets ‚Äì only one hour of on-call close air support was provided. The timings meant that the squadrons could not carry out a detailed reconnaissance of the site prior to the assault being launched. Despite these factors, the commanding officer of 22 SAS, Lieutenant Colonel Ed Butler, accepted the mission. The target was a low priority for the US and probably would have been destroyed from the air if the British hadn't argued for a larger role in Afghanistan; US SOF commanders guarded targets for their own units., p.73 The area of the facility had not often been visited and rarely surveyed, they did not have maps of a scale smaller than 1:1500,000, on which the proposed LZ was not shown, the SAS would have to insert an advance team to check its suitability.Cawthorne, Nigel, Heroes on the Front Line: True Stories of the Deadliest Missions Behind Enemy Lines in Afghanistan and Iraq, John Blake, 2011, Sources vary on number of SAS members involved in the operation, 100 being the lowestEwans, Martin , Conflict in Afghanistan: Studies in Asymmetric Warfare, Routledge, 2014 120Lewis, John E., The Mammoth Book of Covert Ops: True Stories of Covert Military Operations, from the Bay of Pigs to the Death of Osama bin Laden (Mammoth Books), Robinson, 2014, and 140 being the highest Operation =Insertion= The mission began in November 2001, with an 8-man patrol from G Sqn's Air Troop performing the regiment‚Äôs first wartime HALO parachute jump from a United States Air Force (USAF) or Royal Air Force (RAF) C-130 Hercules flying out of Camp Rhino at (other sources say ) and parachuting through Sub-zero temperatures with their parachutes opening automatically at - onto a barren desert site in Registan in Helmand/Kandahar Province to test its suitability as an improvised airstrip for the landing of the main assault force in 6 USAF C-130 Hercules. The Air Troop team confirmed it was suitable and marked out the runway and moved to lay-up positions. Seventeen hours later, the fleet of C-130s (flying out of Bagram Airfield) began to land, each touching down just long enough for the SAS to disembark in their vehicles. Operators from A Sqn G Sqn drove directly off the ramps as the aircraft moved along the desert strip before taking off again; driving 38 Land Rover DPV 110/\\"pinkies\\", 2 logistics vehicles and 8 Kawasaki dirt bikes, they formed up and proceeded towards their target. One Land Rover broke down due to an engine problem, the vehicle was left behind, its 3-man crew stayed to guard it (they were picked up when the assault force exfilled). The assault force drove , the drive being difficult due to poor visibility as a result of the fine dust) within a limited amount of time, to a previously agreed forming-up point and split into two elements - the main assault force and the FSB (fire support base). A Sqn was given the task of assaulting the target facility, while G Sqn took the role of FSB. G Sqn would suppress the enemy with vehicle-mounted L7A2 GPMGs, M2 Browning HMGs, MILAN antitank missiles along with L16 81mm mortars and Barrett M82A1 sniper rifles, (from a position away) allowing A Sqn to close in on the target. The force was out of range of coalition artillery. If necessary, G Sqn would send in additional men if the attack got pinned down. The force lay in wait during the first hours of the early morning. Just after 0700h, A Sqn observed the enemy moving in and out of the trenches.Neville, Leigh, Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2008, Neville, Leigh, Special Operations Patrol Vehicles: Afghanistan and Iraq (New Vanguard), Osprey Publishing, 2011Cawthorne, Nigel, Heroes on the Front Line: True Stories of the Deadliest Missions Behind Enemy Lines in Afghanistan and Iraq, John Blake, 2011, =Assault= The assault began with a preparatory air-strike: United States Navy (USN) F/A-18 Hornets (F-18) and F-14 Tomcats (F-14) bombed and strafed the area, destroying the plant's depots (¬£50 million worth of Opium). Following this, A Sqn moved at high speed from its start line, firing their weapons whilst dodging RPG-7 rockets. They pulled up meters from the outer perimeter to dismount from their vehicles and closed in on the last few hundred yards to the target on foot over difficult terrain. The main body formed a semi circle in front of and below the first trenches, where they were ordered to assault. The opposing forces responded by firing their AK-47 assault rifles and RPG-7s, while other fighters could be seen moving into positions further away. All the while, G Sqn (who were positioned in a 'bullhorn' formation around the facility) provided covering fire with heavy weapons onto the facility. A Sqn encountered heavy resistance from the bunkers and trenches and eventually became pinned down. Air support flew sorties until they ran out of munitions; on a final pass, after destroying an enemy-occupied bunker with a GPS-guided JDAM, an F-18 strafed a bunker with its Vulcan cannon, narrowly missing several members of G Sqn. As A Sqn closed on the fortified positions, an SAS trooper was wounded, with two other SAS members dashing forward and carrying him to safety. At least 12 SAS soldiers managed to penetrate the entrances to caves and trenches, killing at least 6 al-Qaeda and/or Taliban fighters. Even though they were not well trained, the Al-Qaeda fighters fought ferociously, and the SAS had to fight hard to make progress. As the fighting continued, more and more fighters came out of the trenches and into the open, with heavy fire being exchanged; one SAS officer was hit by two rounds in his ceramic plates and a third in his water bottle on his belt kit. A member of the SAS who participated in the raid said of the terrorists that \\"these guys were lunatics\\" and that \\"surrender was the last thing on their minds. They would run out of the front line firing. It was something out of the First World War, these were not people, proper soldiers, who could be treated with dignity. If they had a breath left in them they would be trying to shoot you so we had no choice but to kill.\\" The RSM in command of the FSB joined in the action, bringing forward the CO's HQ team to reinforce A Sqn when he believed the assault was stalling. They were several hundred meters from the enemy positions when he was shot in the leg by an AK-47 round, making him the second SAS soldier to be wounded. Several SAS soldiers were prevented from getting injured and/or killed by their body armour and helmets (they were equipped with tactical helmets and plate carrier body armour; most disliked wearing the helmets and allegedly had to be ordered to do so).Neville, Leigh, and Dennis, Peter, The SAS 1983-2014 (Elite), 2016, Osprey Publishing, Eventually, the A Sqn assault force reached the objective. Using the Maglite torches on their weapons they cleared the caves. In one cave, they found 3 fighters sleeping, who were killed when they started scrambling for their weapons. They also cleared the HQ building, gathering all intelligence materials they could find. More fighters closed in on the SAS assault force who were then engaged by SAS snipers as both sides were now too close for air support to be called in. After 2 hours and finally mopping up the last remnants of al-Qaeda fighters at the facility, the objective had been cleared. In the al-Qaeda HQ, A Sqn members found an intelligence bounty- two laptops and a mass of paperwork with information. The mission lasted 4 hours and a total of 4 SAS operators had been wounded. Both squadrons withdrew and rendezvoused with a US CH-47 Chinook to extract their wounded, while the rest were extracted by C-130 Hercules from a TLZ (Temporary Landing Zone).Cawthorne, Nigel, Heroes on the Front Line: True Stories of the Deadliest Missions Behind Enemy Lines in Afghanistan and Iraq, John Blake, 2011, Aftermath The 4 wounded SAS operators' injuries were not life- threatening. The lowest number of al-Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters killed is 18;Clements, Frank A., Conflict in Afghanistan: An Encyclopedia (Roots of Modern Conflict), ABC-CLIO, 2003 other sources put the figure at 73 al-Qaeda killed. Several dozen more were wounded and captured, though no high level al-Qaeda leadership were among those killed or captured. By 18 December 2001, members of A Sqn and G Sqn were back at their base in the UK. Members of both squadrons were awarded a total of two CGCs, one DSO, two MCs and several MiDs;Cawthorne, Nigel, Heroes on the Front Line: True Stories of the Deadliest Missions Behind Enemy Lines in Afghanistan and Iraq, John Blake, 2011, the strategic significance of the facility has never fully been explained. In January and February 2002, media sensationalised with accounts of the operation based mostly on speculation, with some suggesting that the bravery of the SAS merited Victoria Crosses.Orchard, Adrian, and Orchard, James Barrington, Joint Force Harrier, Penguin Group, 2008, =Date of the operation= Most sources place the operation in November (specifically between mid and late November) of that year, however some sources say the operation took place in December.Nicol, Mark Ultimate Risk: SAS Contact Al Qaeda, Macmillan, 2004, One source gives the date as 22 November., p.73 See also * Operation Larchwood 4 References Category:Operations involving British special forces Category:21st-century military history of the United Kingdom Category:Special Air Service Category:Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) involving the United States Category:Conflicts in 2001 Category:2001 in Afghanistan Category:Afghanistan conflict (1978‚Äìpresent) Category:Battles of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) ","title":"Operation Trent"},{"id":"54011821","title":"Let's Hear It for the Dogs"},{"id":"54011834","text":"Hugo Mujica (born 30 August 1942) is an Argentine Catholic priest, poet, writer, and former Trappist monk. Biography Mujica was born in Avellaneda, a neighborhood near the city of Buenos Aires, to an anarchist syndicalist father. As his father became blind after a work accident when Mujica was only thirteen years of age, he began to work in a glass factory, continuing with high school at night school. At the same time he pursued studies in Fine Arts. He worked in the factory until 1961 when he departed with a visitor visa to America, having only 37 dollars in his wallet, no knowledge of English and escaping from the mandatory military service, in this way violating the law. Amidst the fervour of the sixties he settled in Greenwich Village, New York. There he began to study philosophy at the experimental Free University of New York, and resumed painting at School of Visual Arts. He was an active painter until the final years of the sixties when, following his own account, 'painting left me'. He briefly experimented with marijuana and LSD, part of the scene in those days. He briefly met Ralph Metzner, who helped to publish one of his drawings. He was irreligious most of his young years, but that changed with his encounter with Swami Satchidananda. He converted to Catholicism when contemplating monastic life. He was also present at Woodstock's 1969 music festival, which he later considered his 'farewell to the world'. During a trip along with Satchidananda, only a week after the festival, he became acquainted with the monastic life of the Trappist monastery. Joining shortly thereafter, he lived under vow of silence for seven years. He travelled to a French monastery of the same order. He began to write poetry during his time of monastic asceticism, after three years of having joined the order. He refers to those days in silence as having given him 'an extra lung that other people do not have and I do, I feel that way'. He visited Mount Athos, Greece, to experience the way of the Eastern Hesychast tradition. He travelled to Europe one more time, and having returned to Argentina finally settled down. He spent a year in solitude in a countryside located in General Alvear, where he wrote his biography only to put it in the trash, because he needed to tell himself what he had lived until that day, and \\"bring myself up to date and make with that much experiences a narration, a knowing myself in the course of saying myself\\". He later came back to the city of Buenos Aires, joined seminary and in little time he became a priest. He studied theology and philosophical anthropology. After a few years of officiating at a parish, he left momentarily his priestly vocation and turned to writing in its entirety, along with lecturing abroad and engaging in poetic festivals around the world. In 2006 he began to practice yoga once again. He is still a priest. He participated in a TV debate with Gilles Lipovetsky, along with Juan Jos√© Sebreli, criticizing the complacency of the French philosopher regarding market economy.

When Wong arrives back in his room, Shau, who was bathing behind a curtain, lies to him claiming to be one of the Soong sisters and at the same time, the daughter of Emperor Zhao Bing, while unsuccessfully trying to con money from him. At the hotel's restaurant, Shau sees Wong in person the first time and tries to sell him some of his belongings she stole from his room and finally realizes who he is aftering seeing a picture of him in his pocketwatch that she stole and chokes on a sour plum she placed in her wine glass.

The next day, the workers and guest of the Peace Hotel celebrate the departure of the Grand Hall bandits.

Its first intended goal was to capture both the highway and the al-Tanf border crossing, thus securing the Damascus countryside from a potential rebel attack. Later, multiple other fronts were opened as part of the operation throughout the desert, as well as operation \\"Grand Dawn\\" against ISIL with the aim of reopening the Damascus-Palmyra highway and preparing for an offensive towards Deir ez-Zor. Since 2016, the United States and the United Kingdom operated and manned a training facility in al-Tanf (the \\"Al Tanf Garrison\\"), with their special operations troops advising a Syrian rebel group known as the Revolutionary Commando Army.US-led coalition strikes pro-Syrian regime forces CNN, 6 June 2017. The garrison was reinforced in May, and then expanded in June 2017, with more advanced U.S. offensive weapons, including the HIMARS multiple rocket launchers.Coalition forces reinforce at key Al Tanf garrison in Syria Gulf News, 2 June 2017.Exclusive: US deploys long-range artillery system to southern Syria for first time CNN, 13 June 2016.U.S. moves long- range rocket launchers into southern Syria, intelligence sources say Reuters, 14 June 2017. On a number of occasions, U.S. forces struck advancing pro- government troops and militia in what U.S. forces dubbed ‚Ä≥self-defense strikes‚Ä≥. Background In the months prior to the offensive, the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) waged a campaign against the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the desert border region known as the Badia, which ended with ISIL being fully expelled from the southern Syrian desert. This also brought the rebels closer to the southeastern countryside of Damascus and government-held territory. The offensive =Advance along the Baghdad‚ÄìDamascus highway= On 7 May 2017, the Syrian Arab Army, led by the 5th Corps and Iranian-backed militias, launched an attack on the FSA in the Sabaa Biyar area of Homs province.Syria army 'moves into area' where rebels evicted ISIL, Al-Jazeera, 15 May 2017 By the following day, the SAA had advanced some 45 kilometers and captured several sites east of the Al-Seen Airbase in the advance, including: the Zaza Checkpoint, the Sabihiyah Mountains and the Sabaa Biyar area. The advance gave them fire control over this rural region. The FSA began a counteroffensive on 9 May, with the intended goal of recapturing these areas as well as the large mountains overlooking the Baghdad-Damascus road. The commander of the Lions of the East Army, Tlas al-Salama, claimed that Syrian warplanes had struck rebel outposts near the Syrian-Jordanian border after which his group fired missiles towards Khalhala airport. At the end of the day, the rebels recaptured the Zaza checkpoint, but failed to re-enter the Sabaa Biyar area. On 10 May, clashes renewed in the Zaza area and two days later the Army recaptured the Zaza checkpoint, as well as the Sabihiyah Mountains. In an attempt to counter the Army's advances, the rebels fired dozens of 'Grad' rockets on Army positions. In retaliation, the Syrian Air Force hit FSA convoys and their rearguard headquarters at the al-Tanf border crossing, and on 12 May Iraqi Shi'ite militias launched an offensive from the east to drive the militants from the desert region. In the night between 14 and 15 May, pro-government reinforcements arrived in the area, including Iraqi Shiite militias. The reinforcements concentrated in the town of Biyar Al-Saba. More Army tanks, as well as surface-to-air missiles, were brought closer to the frontline. By this point, government forces were within 24 and 100 kilometers of al-Tanf. Meanwhile, U.S. and British special forces had arrived at the border crossing to assist the rebels in their ongoing offensive towards ISIL-held Deir ez-Zor. On 18 May, National Defense Forces, alongside the 5th and 7th Armored Divisions of the Syrian Army, advanced 35 kilometers into rebel-held areas in eastern As-Suwayda Governorate. Meanwhile, government forces were probing to determine how near they could get to al-Tanf and reached positions about 27 kilometers from the town, when the lead portion of their advancing convoy was hit by US-led Coalition air-strikes. According to a U.S. defense official, before the strikes were conducted, government troops were warned they were getting too close to Coalition forces garrisoned in al-Tanf but did not respond. According to the U.S., four or five vehicles were destroyed, including a tank and two bulldozers. In contrast, the Syrian Army reported that two tanks were destroyed and a Shilka SPAAG was damaged.Scott Lucas Syria Developing: US Warplanes, Supporting Rebels, Hit Pro-Assad Forces in East, 'EAWorldview 18 May 2017 Eight soldiers were killed. The next day, despite the US-led Coalition's air-strikes, pro-government forces captured the Zarqa junction near al-Tanf. The Army also sent more reinforcements to the highway. Meanwhile, the pro-government Iranian-backed militias advanced southwards from the government-held eastern Qalamoun area on the 19th, taking territory from US-backed rebels in the Badia.Pro-regime forces advance toward base in Syrian desert as US warns: Coalition will 'defend' itself, SyriaDirect, 22 May 2017 =Push along the Jordanian border= On 20 May, the Syrian Army, alongside their paramilitary allies, captured part of the eastern part of as-Suwayda province, namely the al-Zuluf area. The following day, government forces further advanced and captured several positions in the southern Syrian desert. In response to the government advances, FSA groups in the area launched an operation named \\"Badia Volcano\\" to fight the pro-government forces. On 22 May, the Army captured the Al-Rahbeh area, 25 kilometers north of the Zuluf dam, with no direct clashes taking place, save for an artillery duel. Thus the Army was 30 kilometers from cutting off a large, sparsely populated, rebel-held area in the south-eastern Damascus countryside. Also, during the last week, the Syrian Army managed to secure 70 kilometers of the Syrian-Jordanian border. Towards the end of the day, the Syrian Army reached positions six kilometers south of the newly captured Scientific Research Battalion, while other forces advanced east of the Zuluf Dam. These advances, brought the Army close to completely encircling and cutting off rebel forces in the south- eastern part of Damascus governorate from their comrades in and around Al- Tanf.

Government forces swiftly captured over 1,200 square kilometers of territory, including numerous hills and villages from ISIL. The next day, the Army made a push south and east of Palmyra as well, capturing several locations, including Abtar mountain and Arak gas fields. This brought the total number of open fronts as part of the operation to clear the Syrian desert of rebels and ISIL to six. On 25 May, the Army captured half a dozen locations, paving the way for the reopening of the Damascus-Palmyra highway the following day.Waleed Khaled a-Noufal US-backed rebels losing territory in east Syrian desert to regime, Syria Direct, 29 May 2017 = Syrian Army reaches the Iraqi border = On 30 May, the Syrian Army, alongside the National Defense Forces and Iraqi paramilitary units, captured the Helba area in south-eastern Homs province, thus coming within 50 km of the border with Iraq. The next day, FSA groups launched a counteroffensive called Operation This is Our Land and launched barrages of BM-21 Grad rockets at government forces. The rebels claimed to have broken through the first government lines of defense near the Zaza checkpoint. In response, the Syrian and Russian Air Forces conducted airstrikes against the rebels.

This tradition, one of the most famous in Wallonia, is also known for its principal attraction: the \\"Blancs Moussis\\".Martin Dunford and Phil Lee, Belgium and Luxembourg (2002), 365.The word comes from adjective Walloon \\"blanc mouss√Æ\\" white-clothed; in Standardized Walloon, the graph \\"√Æ\\" shows a long vowal, but local pronunciation in short, hence, the usual graph Moussi; in the substantivied noun, \\"blanc\\" has the value of an adverb, and in invariable in Walloon (des blanc-mouss√Æs). History For several centuries the city of Stavelot was the capital of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, which was ruled by a prince-abbot. He is said to have forbidden his clerics from taking part in the popular festivities. According to popular legend, the inhabitants of Stavelot, who enjoyed the participation of monks in the festivities, decided to make fun of this prohibition by dressing up as monks to celebrate carnival until this too was prohibited. Then, in 1502, they created a white costume with a hood referring more discreetly to the monastic habit.http://www.laetare- stavelot.be/laetare/peu-dhistoire/ This costume was finally accepted by the abbot. The Stavelotains added to the costume a strange mask with a very long, red and pointed nose; thus, the Blancs Moussis (in English: White CladAntony Mason, Eyewitness Travel: Belgium & Luxembourg (2013), p. 32.) were born.Walter Fostier, Folk-lore vivant (1960), 31-32. As an emblematic group of the Laetare de Stavelot and symbol of Walloon folklore, the Blancs Moussis have so far existed for more than five centuries, but it was not always easy for them. During the French occupation, they could not go out and party, returning stronger after 1820. In 1947, they created a fraternity with sparkling costumes and the group continued growing. They became dynamic ambassadors of Belgian folklore and are often invited as special guests to the Carnivals of D√ºsseldorf, Cologne, Compi√®gne, Saint-Quentin and elsewhere. This contributes to the fame of Stavelot. Customs During the parade, the Blancs Moussis shower people with confetti, dance, hit people‚Äôs heads with inflated pig bladders, and otherwise entertain the crowd by jumping, grunting, imitating others. During the final part of the show on the Saint Remacle square, the Blancs Moussis lead the spectators in amazing farandoles around the monumental fountain.Olivier Thunus, Carnaval: le Laetare de Stavelot va compl√®tement changer de parcours, RTBF, 26 Jan. 2017, updated 27 Jan. 2017 They then put up posters on the house walls and shop windows, posters with word games, making fun sometimes of the local inhabitants, victims of something funny, embarrassing,... during the previous months.

Background  Between January and April 2017, the Syrian Army conducted an offensive that saw them capture the city of Dayr Hafir, the towns of Tadef and Al-Khafsah, and nearly 250 villages from ISIL. They also managed to cut off the Turkish Army from advancing further into Syria, and secured the water supply to Aleppo. The offensive was halted in early April, just short of capturing the Jirah Airbase, after government forces were redirected to fend off a rebel offensive against Hama.  The offensive  = Battle for Jirah Airbase = On 9 May, Syrian government forces restarted their operations against ISIL in the eastern countryside of Aleppo, as the Russian Air Force conducted heavy air-strikes against ISIL positions. The next day, government troops captured the village of Al-Mahdoum, after which they quickly attacked two villages southwest of the ISIL-held Jirah Airbase. The capture of the villages would give the Army fire-control over the airbase. However, the assault was eventually repelled due to heavy ISIL anti-tank missile fire. Two suicide-bombers and armed drones were also used by ISIL. Late on 12 May, Syrian government troops captured the Jirah Airbase. ISIL forces in the Maskanah Plain then launched a counterattack on the airbase. A day later, after the ISIL counterattack was repelled, and the Syrian Army resumed their offensive in the region, capturing the last hill overlooking the airbase. = Capture of Maskanah = Led by the Tiger Forces, the Syrian Army swept through the countryside south and southwest of the airbase on 17 May, capturing 11 villages. Between 21 and 24 May, the Tiger Forces captured another 11 villages, reaching within 6 km from ISIL's stronghold of Maskanah. On 26 May, the Tiger Forces captured a village just three kilometers from Maskanah. The next morning, the Tiger Forces, alongside Al-Baqir tribal fighters, overran large areas east of Lake Jabbul, capturing 11 villages, and thus securing the entirety of Lake Jabbul for the first time since 2014. The same day, the Tiger Forces also took control of Maskanah's train station, as well as other nearby areas, bringing them to 1.5 km from Maskanah. At the start of June, the Army continued with its advances around Maskanah, captured 16 villages and cutting off ISIL's main supply route towards Maskanah, effectively encircling it. On 3 June, the Syrian Army, led by the Tiger forces, captured Maskanah and the surrounding villages after ISIL fighters withdrew from the area, thus expelling ISIL from its last stronghold in Aleppo governorate. The next day, the Army came reached the boundaries of Raqqa Governorate after a battle, during which they seized two villages. = Advance to Raqqa's border = On 5 June, the Tiger Forces captured half a dozen villages in Masakanah's countryside, coming close towards fully expelling ISIL from Aleppo Governorate. The next day, government forces captured another six villages, officially reentering Ar-Raqqah province. On 8 June, ISIL's foothold crumbled near Lake Assad, resulting in the withdrawal of the group from areas near it, including around 20 villages, creating a no man's land between the Syrian Army and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

Early life  Born in Central California, Dean grew up in Davis, California. At age 12, her family moved to Long Island, New York. Dean's mother was an English professor and her father an Asian studies professor. Dean attended Sacred Heart Academy in Hempstead, New York. In high school, Dean had interests in ballet, speech and debate, winning several trophies in switch-side varsity debate and oral interpretation in prose and poetry. She also competed in both state and national championships. Her aesthetic as a teenager veered a little Goth and a little glamorous.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/fashion/a-profile-of-cecilia- dean.html  Modeling career  During high school, Dean and her friends were frequent visitors to Manhattan. On one such trip, she was scouted by a photographer who introduced her to Louise Despointes, owner of City Models. Despointes signed Dean as a model. While a senior in high school, Dean began modeling for the American edition of Seventeen Magazine . Despointes arranged for Dean to do photos with fashion photographer Stephen Gan and makeup artist James Kaliardos. One of her first jobs was in 1986 with Mario Testino for the cover of a special teen edition of the Italian magazine, Lei. They went on to work on many more shoots together in Europe. After graduating high school, Dean moved to Paris, France to pursue modeling, traveling in Europe and Japan. But after a year and a half, Dean returned to New York to attend Barnard College, majoring in English and French literature. During her modeling career, Dean modeled for Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Peter Lindbergh, Steven Meisel, Ellen Von Unwerth, Steven Klein, Mert and Marcus, and Inez and Vinoodh.  Personal life Dean lives in Red Hook, Brooklyn, with her partner, real estate and food entrepreneur David Selig.  Visionaire In 1991, Dean founded Visionaire, an art and fashion publication with Stephen Gan and James Kaliardos. Her agent, Louise Despointes, arranged to have Dean do photos with Gan and Kaliardos, one of her first test shoots‚Äîjust to do a few photos for all of their books. Artists who work in collaboration with Visionaire to produce interpretations on a theme are given freedom to push its content and original formats. Though artists aren't paid, many notable figures in art and fashion have worked on an issue with Visionaire. Dean continues to run Visionaire with Kaliardos and has grown it from a publication to a company that curates luxury art fashion experiences .  Museum shows In 2010 Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS1 in Queens, New York, approached Dean and then New York Times columnist David Colman about creating fashion exhibits for the museum. The first project was called \\"MOVE!\\". With the self-imposed rule that the mannequins would be naked and no art would be hung on walls, Dean and Colman created a show that paired fashion designers with artists to create participatory experiences. The next MoMA PS1 show was \\"POSE\\" by Ryan McNamara and Diane von Furstenberg. The participants changed into signature DVF wrap- dresses and were treated to quick hair and make-up. Once ready, performance artist McNamara would photograph the participants in precise fashion poses. These photos were immediately uploaded to a program that transformer the photos into textile patterns of the participants. The participants could then order DVF wrap-dresses with their patterns printed on the fabric: a one-of-a- kind DVF wrap-dress of oneself wearing a DVF wrap-dress. The third exhibit was \\"LOOKS\\" by Rob Pruitt and Marc Jacobs.In this exhibit, the participant is instructed to walk down a long green hallway. As they do so, someone barks orders to \\"walk like a supermodel\\", \\"don't smile\\", \\"give attitude\\", etc. Upon exiting the hallway, the participant is faced with large projections of themselves superimposed into the Marc Jacobs fashion show. In 2013 and 2014, Dean and Colman mounted MOVE! for 10 days in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In 2015, they mounted the show again in New York at Brookfield Place.

He is known for being a leading proponent in the area of architectural programming. A U.S. Army veteran from World War II, he received a Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart. Early life Pe√±a was born on February 10, 1919 in Laredo, Texas, where his father Eduardo F. Pe√±a was a grocer. He attended St. Augustine Catholic School in the city and in 1937 he graduated from Laredo High School. He was a Boy Scout and in high school he was president of the Pan American Student Club and co-editor of The Journal, the school paper. Prior to World War II, he was a student at Texas A&M; University. In 1941, he was a junior, wearing a military uniform in his class picture and was identified as an Intelligence Sergeant. He graduated with a bachelor's degree on May 16, 1942. World War II On May 17, 1942, Pe√±a was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army and entered officer training. In September 1944, he was sent to Europe. In December 1944 he fought at the Battle of the Bulge. He was one of 20,000 soldiers from Texas A&M; University at the battle in the Ardennes forest of France, Luxembourg, and Belgium. A captain, he was one of the nearly 15,000 officers from A&M; at the Battle of the Bulge. He was near Schleiden, Germany in March 1945, repairing a communications line, when a landmine explosion resulted in the loss of his leg. He returned to the United States, receiving treatment at an Army hospital in Utah and a hospital in San Francisco. During that time, he developed an interest in classical music. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart. Belgium developed the idea for the \\"From Texas to Bastogne: Texas Aggies Go to War\\" exhibit for the 70th anniversary of the battle. The interactive exhibit that honors the soldiers and features five specific soldiers, including Pe√±a, was located in 16 rooms of an old convent in Bastogne, Belgium for two years before being moved to College Station, Texas in 2016. The Mardasson Memorial at Bastogne displays a \\"large-scale, outdoor dramatization of the exhibit\\". He was also one of the veterans recognized at the Texas A&M; Hispanic Network (TAMHN) Summit of 2015. He wrote a memoir of his war experiences, As Far As Schleiden. Career In 1948, he earned a master's degree in architecture from Texas A&M; University. One of his teachers was William Wayne Caudill. Pe√±a's master project was a design for an elementary school, which was used as an initial design by the firm for the construction of the school for the Blackwell, Oklahoma school district and the beginning of the approach to finely define the requirements for actual design work that involved \\"squatting\\" with the client until the specifications were clear. It was the first school for the firm that built its name on design schools. Pe√±a, hired by Caudill in 1948, was the first employee of the Caudill Rowlett Scott (CRS) architectural firm. In 1949, he was made a partner, but expressed that it would be best to keep the company name with the first three partners names rather than extending it with each new partner. By 1954, he wrote two articles about school architecture with Caudill, \\"What Characterizes a Good School Building\\" for The School Executive and \\"Color in the Classroom\\" for the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. He promoted the concept of architectural programming where considerations, materials, goals, and a problem statement were formulated by analysts or programmers, which were to be solved by the architects. It has been defined as \\"a process that provides the general direction a building's design should take after the client's goals and needs are determined\\". He wrote the first edition of Problem Seeking: An architectural programming primer in 1969 with a CRS programmer, John Focke, to document the process. Its concepts were incorporated into the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) in 1973 and the third edition written with Kevin Kelly and Steven Parshall was published by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1987. The book is now a standard architecture textbook. In 1978, the book he co- authored with William Wayne Caudill and Paul Kennon, Architecture and You: How to Experience and Enjoy Building was published. He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. , he continued to work as an architect. Personal life He lived in Houston, Texas and visited Europe after the war.

It is a standalone to the Day of Infamy mod released for their previous title, Insurgency. Day of Infamy uses Valve's Source engine. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on March 23, 2017. There are various maps in this game, all of which are based around the western front conflicts of 1941-1945. The final update for the game was released on the 21st of December, 2017. After that, community efforts like Screaming Steel 1914-1918 were last updated in August 2019. Development Day of Infamy began as a free mod to their previous title, Insurgency. The mod was released to Steam's Workshop on January 16, 2016, and was updated through May 26, 2016. A closed alpha was released on July 19, 2016. Day of Infamy was approved for release in Steam's Early Access program on July 28, 2016. The game entered the beta phase on December 22, 2016, and left Early Access on March 23, 2017. Last update was on the 21st of December, 2017. Gameplay Day of Infamy draws a lot of its gameplay from Insurgency. Much like their previous title, Day of Infamy lacks a crosshair, HUD map, and on certain servers, a kill feed. A player will die by being shot once with a rifle, and respawns occur in waves to simulate reinforcements (when the team has these waves available). Each teammate gets a number of Supply Points they can spend on weapons and gear for their soldier, a class in each team to select and a weight system which affects Stamina and player speed. There are nine player classes that a player can choose from. The available classes are: * Officer, * Rifleman, * Assault, * Support, * Flamethrower, * Radioman, * Engineer, * Machinegunner, * and Sniper. Each team receives a certain number of reinforcement waves dependent on game mode. Your team gains Supply points by completing map objectives and killing players from the opposite team.  Maps and Game Modes  The game is based around various operations and conflicts in World War 2. These include: * Normandy battles and the Beach Landings, 1944. * Invasion of Crete, Greece in 1941 * British-French evacuation of Dunkirk, 1940. * Allied invasion of the Rhineland west bank and western parts of Germany, 1945. * The Italian Campaign and Sicily, 1943.-1944. * Battle of the Bulge, 1944.-1945. Battles and Casual w/ Bots focus on games with reinforcements and larger player numbers, with up to 32, to 40 players at a time. Special Assignments have 16 player servers, and no reinforcement waves available or limited and special case respawns. = Battles or Casual W/ Bots* =  Frontline*  Frontline is a 5 controlpoint based mode, where each team gets an equal amount of reinforcement waves. Each team has an HQ Radio, or the Base control point which can be destroyed. A team wins by wiping out the enemy team or seizing all objectives and destroying the Radio. Teams gain or lose reinforcement waves by completing or losing objectives and the team with the most objectives by the time limit, also wins.  Invasion*  An attack/defense game mode, where the attacking team receives about only 25% of the defender's reinforcements, and has to complete all objectives one by one, finally destroying their radio HQ or just wipe them all out. If attackers reach the radio or HQ objective, defenders will immediately lose all reinforcements. Attackers receive more reinforcements, and defenders slowly lose them, by successfully attacking all objectives.  Offensive  A minor variation on the Invasion game mode, where the defenders have infinite reinforcements and only have to regroup at their spawn to get their dead teammates back. Attackers have regular waves.  Liberation  A number of objectives are neutral and already available, to both teams and are able to be immediately taken in any order. Bonuses are given for taking objectives behind enemy lines. The advancing team gains more reinforcements, and wins by taking and holding all the objectives or by wiping out the enemy team. = Special Assignments =  Intel  A capture-the-flag style game mode. The attackers have to take an intel folder from the defenders, while defenders have to stop them.  Firefight  Similar to Liberation, players have to take all objectives or wipe out the enemy team. Players respawn by capturing objectives for their team.  Sabotage  Attackers are to infiltrate, seek out and destroy enemy AA defenses and Fuel depot locations around the defenders. The defenders are to stop them, and win if not all objectives are completed! = Co-op Game Modes =  Stronghold  Very similar to Invasion, except the defenders are all bots and attackers have to seize all objectives.  Raid  Fuel depots, enemy officers and AA defenses are all targets and the objectives of the attackers to complete. This is to simulate a special forces type, SAS style raid in World War 2.  Entrenchment  Very similar to Offensive, where Defenders are human players that have to defend against waves of enemies. They retreat to spawn to regroup and respawn all teammates. Reception Day of Infamy received a 77 out of 100 on Metacritic.

It offers thirteen topic- based categories and one region-based category with hand-picked and reviewed users' suggested resources. Jasmine Directory was founded in 2009 by P√©csi Andr√°s and Robert Gombo»ô and is headquartered in Valley Cottage, New York. It won eight prizes during 2013‚Äì2014 for its editorial discretion and manually added resources. Jasmine Directory proved to be useful for SEO Google search results since they manually add about 90% of the resources.  History  The directory was launched in 2009 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics by P√©csi Andr√°s and Robert Gombo»ô. It operates from Valley Cottage, New York.  Operation and structure  Jasmine Directory lists educational resources and businesses of public interest, which can be filtered based on business category. Jasmine Directory's editors manually add resources to the index, which according to co-founder Gombo»ô represents 90% of its listings. Businesses and site owners can also suggest their websites for review by paying a \\"suggestion fee;\\" however, inclusion is not guaranteed if the suggested resources do not comply with the editorial guidelines, in which case the review fee is refunded. The annual fee for standard listings is $59. Site owners are not paying for placement, but they are paid for editing and the administrative effort to review and create a listing. The directory labels listings chosen by editors using an \\"EP\\" mark to separate those websites from ones submitted by site owners. To suggest a resource for inclusion, users may select an appropriate category; they can also customize their listing by adding their websites' social media fan pages and contact information based on which businesses' Google Maps location will be generated accordingly. Once the listing is posted, its publisher can edit the details any time, but an upgrade feature is also available for those who change the listing. The directory runs an audit of all external resources every two to three months so as to remove dead links, dropped or parked domains, etc. Every website that doesn't come back online within a timeframe is deleted from their index. Likewise, redirected sites and sites with questionable legitimacy are turned down. The directory is organized by topic and region into 14 categories. Each main category has several subcategories, including recreation and sports, regional, home and garden, business and finance, and computers and technology. Each category and subcategory is described and contains a relevant image. A blog where users can read industry-specific articles is also featured. In an interview, Gombo»ô stated the directory's purpose is to list educational references along with local amenities and businesses of public interest. = Main categories = The 14 main categories are: # Arts & Humanities # Business & Finance # Computers & Technology # Health & Fitness # Home & Garden # Internet & Marketing # Kids & Teens # Leisure & Travel # News & Politics # People & Society # Recreation & Sports # Regional # Science & Reference # Shopping & E-commerce  Reception  Between 2013 and 2014, Jasmine Directory was rated and awarded eight times in \\"Top Ten Web Directories\\", by former DMOZ meta editor and owner and operator of the Magic City Morning Star Ken Anderson. For Anderson's list, 90 general web directories were reviewed quarterly and assessed in five areas including aesthetics, size, intuitiveness, quality and usefulness. As of December 2014, Moz had assigned Jasmine Directory a Domain Authority of 60/100, a Page Authority of 67/100, MozRank of 6.81, and a MozTrust of 6.64. Its Majestic Trust Flow was 59, while the Citation Flow value was 49. In 2016, a listing in the directory appeared to be useful for search engine optimization for local Google search results. The same year, the directory obtained a score of 5 in a rating session conducted by the Association of Internet Research Specialists and published in the Internet Information Resource Book where search engines, web directories, online archives and online databases have been rated on a scale from 1 to 5+. According to information posted on the Social Implications blog, Jasmine Directory appeared to be compliant with Google's general guidelines as of February 2018. Essentially, this means that they use editorial discretion to permit or deny which businesses they allow in their directory listings. Also, the Daily News Egypt found the directory to follow \\"the rules set forth by Google\\". Ann Smarty, search marketer and columnist at Entrepreneur, found the directory provided a \\"valuable user experience\\". In 2018, Shawn Hessinger, an industry-specific author and the executive editor of Small Business Trends, praised the directory as \\"selective\\", while in a more mixed review, an editor of TNT labelled it as \\"very traditional\\" and \\"tad simplistic\\" with an \\"old looking interface\\".

Gundry is an American doctor and author. He is a former cardiac surgeon and currently runs his own clinic, investigating the impact of diet on health. Gundry conducted cardiac surgery research in the 1990s and was a pioneer in infant heart transplant surgery, and is a New York Times best- selling author of The Plant Paradox: The Hidden Dangers in \\"Healthy\\" Foods That Cause Disease and Weight Gain. He is best known for his disputed claims that lectins, a type of plant protein found in numerous foods, cause inflammation resulting in many modern diseases. The Plant Paradox diet suggests avoiding all foods containing lectins. Scientists and dieticians have classified Gundry's claims about lectins as pseudoscience. He sells supplements that he claims protect against or reverse the supposedly damaging effects of lectins.  Career  =Cardiothoracic Surgeon= Gundry graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in 1972 and went on to earn a medical degree at the Medical College of Georgia in 1977. People reported in 1990 that an infant boy's heart spontaneously healed itself while waiting weeks on life support for a transplant from Gundry and Dr. Leonard Bailey. The boy's recovery made the need for a heart transplant unnecessary, and he received a successful four-hour surgery from Gundry to repair the mitral valve. During his career as a cardiothoracic surgeon, Gundry published three hundred articles and registered several patents for medical devices. In 2002 Gundry began transitioning from Clinical Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the Seventh-day Adventist Loma Linda University School of Medicine to private practice by starting The International Heart & Lung Institute in Palm Springs, California. =Nutritionist= By mid-2000s Gundry had augmented his career as a cardiothoracic surgeon by providing dietary consulting through The Center for Restorative Medicine, a branch of his private surgery practice. While not an accredited dietitian, Gundry's advice focused on heart health and followed conventional wisdom of western diets such as drinking a glass of red wine per day, increase intake of plants and nuts, reduce simple carbohydrates, and consume fish and grass-fed meats. He has since authored two books focused on food-based health interventions, recommending a mostly plant-based diet. Although not mentioned in his first book, Dr. Gundry‚Äôs Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes That Are Killing You and Your Waistline (2008), his second book, The Plant Paradox (2017), advocates avoiding lectins, a class of proteins found in numerous plants. In 2018 he published an accompanying recipe book. T. Colin Campbell, a biochemist and advocate for plant-based diets, states that The Plant Paradox contains numerous unsupported claims and denies that it makes a \\"convincing argument that lectins as a class are hazardous.\\" Robert H. Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association, argues that Gundry's diet advice contradicts \\"every dietary recommendation represented by the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association and so on\\" and that it is not possible to draw any conclusions from Gundry's own research due to the absence of control patients in his studies. Writing in New Scientist, food writer and chef Anthony Warner notes that Gundry's theories \\"are not supported by mainstream nutritional science\\" and that evidence of the benefits of high- lectin containing diets \\"is so overwhelming as to render Gundry‚Äôs arguments laughable\\". Gundry sells supplements that he claims protect against the damaging effect of lectins. Although Today's Dietician acknowledges evidence that consuming lectins in some raw foods like kidney beans can be harmful, it concludes that \\"preliminary studies have revealed potential health benefits of lectin consumption and minute evidence of harm.\\" = Books =    References   External links  * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Yale University alumni Category:Medical College of Georgia alumni Category:Loma Linda University faculty Category:Plant-based diet advocates Category:Pseudoscientific diet advocates ","title":"Steven Gundry"},{"id":"54012596","text":"Caspar Otto von Glasenapp (25 June 1664 at Gut Wurchow, Neustettin district-7 August 1747 in Berlin) was a Prussian officer, most recently Generalfeldmarschall.

On 9 September 1692, Glasenapp was appointed chief of staff, on 15 July 1695, to the captain and company commander of the Regiment (now called the \\"Fusilier-Garde\\"). During the War of Spanish Succession, Glasenapp took part in the fighting in Hungary, on the Rhine and in the Brabant. Glasenapp was promoted to major on 10 November 1705, on 6 December 1709 to the lieutenant colonel. On 11 May 1713 he became colonel and regimental commander, to the colonel and commander of the regiment, called Regiment Wartensleben zu Fuss. On 17 October 1723 he became Generalmajor and Proprietor (Inhaber) (chief) of his regiment, Regiment Glasenapp zu Fuss. On 10 February 1729, Glasenapp was appointed Commander of Berlin. He continued to implement the detailed arrangements of King Frederick William I for the purpose of curbing beggary and cleanliness in the streets of Berlin. His efforts to enforce order and discipline were respected in the city. On 12 May 1732 he became a lieutenant general, on 1 December 1735 governor of Berlin, but he remained at the same time a regimental clerk. Glasenapp became a Prelate of the Hohenstift of Cammin in Pomerania on 1 January 1737, general of the infantry on 29 June 1740.

Mears Avenue in Whitehall, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. It now houses the Lewis House Bed and Breakfast. History John C. Lewis was born in Canada in 1837, and moved to the United States in 1855. He finally settled in Whitehall in 1861, working as a day laborer. There he met his wife Augusta Covell, the two were married in 1864. Lewis soon purchased a sawmill, sold it, purchased another, and began investing in timberlands. The couple moved briefly to Waukesha, Wisconsin, then moved back to Whitehall in 1878, when they built this house. The Lewises hired local builder L.L Marble to construct the house; work began in April 1878 and was completed by November. John Lewis lived in the house until his death in 1894. After this, ownership of the house was passed to his wife Augusta, who lived there until her own death in 1928. The Lewises' youngest daughter Florence inherited the house, and she lived there until the early 1940s. In 1944, Florence cold the house to local farmers William and Rose Hildebrandt, who converted the house from a single-family home into a nine- bedroom boarding house the called the Lakeview Rooms. In 1960, a water heater explosion killed the Hildebrandts and damaged the house; their son Carl took over the property and continued to operate the Lakeview Rooms for fifteen more years. In 1976, it was sold to the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, who used it as a community school for the arts, then as lodging for out-of-town actors, and then housing for camp faculty. In 2009, Greg and Debra Hillebrand purchased the house. They restored the house, and in 2015 opened it as the Lewis House Bed & Breakfast became a reality in 2015. Description The Lewis House is a narrow and deep two-story Late Victorian structure with a roof that includes both gabled and hip-roof areas. The main front section contains three prominent front and side-facing gables. A rounded-corner front entry porch with fluted Tuscan columns is covered by a flat roof. The house is clad with clapboard, and the eaves are supported by brackets at the corners and project widely. The windows are tall and narrow, and have segmental-arch heads and trim with pediment caps and incised detail.

Biography Wall received his M. Div. from Emory University and an M.A. from the University of Chicago. He was ordained as a minister in the United Methodist Church in 1955.Contemporary Authors entry for James M. Wall He edited the United Methodists‚Äô Christian Advocate from 1962-1972. Time wrote that \\"Wall brought to that journal a bright streak of professionalism while indulging his affection for writing; he was his own film critic.\\"\\"Religion,\\" Time, December 18, 1972, p. 101. Subsequently, he served as editor and publisher of The Christian Century in Chicago from 1972 through February 1999. The Century was considered the flagship magazine of U.S. mainline Protestantism. From 1999 through 2008, he wrote a column for the Christian Century, while serving as Senior Contributing Editor. He was a Contributing Editor from 2008 until July 2017 when his name was removed from the Century's print masthead. He remains listed on the on-line site. According to Newsweek, Wall began his Century editorship by resolving a financial crisis and shifting the focus: \\"I see the Century as the midwife of ideas and issues. We‚Äôre less interested in being programmatic than in reporting the world from a religious perspective,\\" he said.\\"Onward, Christian Century,\\" Newsweek, March 25, 1974. He began his blogJames M. Wall Blog on April 24, 2008. = Film rating = During his Century editorship, Wall had a significant role in developing the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. According to William D. Romanowski, he came to the attention of the film industry after defending the value of such films as The Graduate, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Pawnbroker. His July 1968 speech to the National Association of Theater Owners had a \\"profound effect\\" on theater executives, \\"raising the prospects of vastly improved lines of communication between organized exhibition and religious organizations.\\"Romanowski, p. 175. After serving several terms as chair of the National Council of Churches‚Äôs Film and Industry Committee, in 1994 Wall was named Special Consultant, Relations with the Motion Picture Industry, for the National Council of Churches, and is the National Council of Churches‚Äô representative to the appeals board of the Ratings Board of the Motion Picture Association of America and the National Association of Theater Owners. = Advisory positions = Wall served as a member of a Bioethics Policy Task Force for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from 1994 through early 1996. He also served on a special committee of the National Academy of Science that, at the request of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, monitored dose reconstruction studies at nuclear weapons processing sites, was a member of the Program Review Committee for Battelle Memorial Institute, which monitored a program that identified a permanent location for the nation's high-level nuclear waste disposal site, and was a member of a special committee of the National Academy of Science that produced a 1988 report on the use of animals in biomedical research. = Democratic Party = He has been active in the Democratic Party, serving in a variety of roles. Wall was chair of the Jimmy Carter presidential primary and general election campaigns in Illinois in 1976 and 1980 and a delegate for Carter at the 1976 and 1980 Democratic National Nominating Conventions.Schram, pp. 105-106. He served a term on the Democratic National Committee and was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1972. Also that year, Wall was an organizer and chair of George McGovern's Illinois delegates to the Democratic National Nominating Convention.Hart, pp. 137-137, 236. In 1983-84, Wall took a six-month leave from the Christian Century to manage Congressman Paul Simon's successful primary campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois.Hartley, pp. 205-208. Wall worked for Democratic candidates with whom he disagreed on significant issues, but as a 1992 article in the Chicago Reader noted: \\"What Wall learned 20 years ago is that politics is about power, not perfection. A president with whom you agree 70 percent of the time is better than a candidate with whom you agree 100 percent‚Äîand who loses to somebody with whom you agree only 10 percent of the time.\\"\\"God is in the Precincts.\\" Awards and honors He was Alumnus of the Year in 2001 at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago.James M.

In an introduction to two lectures delivered at Princeton University in 2000, Wall's work combining religion and contemporary culture was described by Princeton's Amy Scott Vaughn, > \\"James M. Wall invites us to join a search for grace in the practices of > everyday life. He examines the secularity that stands as a barrier to > finding God‚Äôs grace and then considers avenues to finding God‚Äôs grace within > that very secularity.

Glick (August 29, 1921 ‚Äì October 2, 2013) was an American philanthropist and builder from Indiana . After returning from serving with the U.S. Army in the European theater during World War II, he and his wife, Marilyn Glick, began constructing housing in the Indianapolis area with other military veterans in mind. Originally concentrating on building single-family homes and then shifting to apartment projects in the 1960s, the Glicks amassed a considerable fortune over their lifetimes, the bulk of which they used for extensive philanthropic endeavors. With more than $142 million in charitable donations to date, the Glicks‚Äô philanthropic impact on the state of Indiana is one of the largest of any family-based organization. Many significant cultural landmarks, civic endeavors and educational entities across the state bear the Glick name. After the deaths of Marilyn Glick in 2012 and Eugene Glick in 2013, oversight of the company and philanthropic activities has remained under the control of their children and other family members. Personal life and military service Eugene Biccard Glick was born in Indianapolis on August 29, 1921, the eldest son of Reuben and Faye Biccard Glick. The family was Jewish of German ancestry. His younger brother, Arthur, died of spinal meningitis in 1937. Gene attended Shortridge High School at the same time as author Kurt Vonnegut. While attending Indiana University, he operated a charter bus service for students. After graduating from IU in December 1942 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in business, Glick enlisted in the U.S. Army. Glick served as an infantry combat instructor until June 1944, when he was deployed to Italy. He soon requested a transfer to the French front, and joined the 179th Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division. His fluency in German led to him serving as an interrogator for Army scouts. He was nearly killed during the Battle of the Bulge, which greatly affected his outlook on life. In his book Born to Build, Glick recounted that on November 11, 1944, he huddled under cover during an intense artillery barrage for hours, and promised himself that if he survived he would always look back on that day as a lesson to never lose hope. Glick and his unit liberated the Dachau concentration camp. He had a camera with him and helped document the atrocities of the Holocaust; Glick later donated his photographs to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Emory University. While serving in the war, Glick received the European Theater medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Bronze Star. Glick‚Äôs wartime experiences led to him being featured in Tom Brokaw‚Äôs best-selling book, The Greatest Generation, as well as contemporaneous television broadcasts hosted by Tom Brokaw and Matt Lauer. Upon returning to Indianapolis after mustering out, Glick founded the G.I. loans department at People‚Äôs Bank. Glick married Marilyn Koffman in 1947, and together they began building single-family homes in Indianapolis, an enterprise that eventually became the Gene B. Glick Company. The couple had four daughters: Marianne Glick, Arlene Grande, Alice Meshbane, and Lynda Schwartz. The Glicks raised their family in the Indianapolis area and continued to reside there for the rest of their lives. In 1982, they created the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Family Foundation and began to devote more of their time and wealth to charitable causes. They remained active in the Indianapolis Jewish community as members of the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation, and were patrons of the Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis, whose community center is named after Glick‚Äôs brother, Arthur. Gene Glick died on October 2, 2013 at the age of 92. The Gene B. Glick Company The Gene B. Glick Company is a multifamily housing development and property management company founded by Gene Glick in 1947. Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, it is one of the largest privately owned firms in the apartment industry within the state and nationwide. As of 2017 it owns and operates properties in 12 states, with more than 20,000 apartment units and approximately 7,000 employees. Glick started the company, then known as Indianapolis Homes Inc., building single family houses on the Eastside of Indianapolis using money he saved while serving in the Army, as well as savings of his wife, Marilyn. His stated aim was to help other military veterans successfully transition to civilian life. During the 1950s the company became a leading franchisee of National Homes, expanding from building single homes to entire subdivisions. By 1962, the company had changed its name to the Gene B. Glick Company and was generating more than $1 million in sales annually.https://www.amazon.com/Born-Build-Story-Glick-Company/dp/1578600057, page 115. In this same year, the company built its first apartment community, Williamsburg East. The business changed its focus from single-family houses to multifamily communities, with an emphasis on creating affordable homes for low-income families using federal Section 8 funding. By 1968, the Gene B. Glick Company had shifted its business model to building, acquiring and managing apartment buildings. From the late 1960s to the 1980s, the company expanded from Indiana to Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, Kentucky and Illinois.https://www.amazon.com/Born-Build-Story-Glick-Company/dp/1578600057, page 150. By the 2000s, Gene and Marilyn Glick became focused on their philanthropic endeavors, turning over more of the daily operations to their children and grandchildren. Gene Glick officially retired in 2008, at which point his granddaughter‚Äôs husband, David Barrett, became President and CEO of the Gene B. Glick Company. The company has continued to expand over the past decade, building or acquiring more apartment communities as well as a new national headquarters building in Indianapolis. In 2017 it expanded into its 12th state, Wisconsin. Philanthropy and honors Gene Glick is regarded as one of the most significant philanthropists in Indiana history. Gene and Marilyn Glick made charitable contributions throughout their lives that grew as their personal fortune did. In 1982, they established the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Family Foundation to organize their philanthropic endeavors. It was later joined by the Glick Family Housing Foundation, which focuses on providing homes and support services for low-income families; the Glick Fund administered by the Central Indiana Community Foundation, which primarily goes toward education, self-sufficiency and the arts; and a separate Glick Fund of the Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis. Glick‚Äôs philanthropic efforts focused on education, health care, affordable housing for low-income families, community support services and the arts. Numerous buildings, landmarks, educational programs and cultural endeavors across Indiana are named after the Glicks. The Indianapolis Cultural Trail: A Legacy of Gene & Marilyn Glick is an 8-mile network of urban pedestrian and bike corridors linking the city‚Äôs seven Indianapolis Cultural Districts. It opened in 2013 after 12 years of planning and six years of construction at a total cost of $62.5 million in a public-private partnership. The Glicks donated $15 million as seed money for the project. The Eugene and Marilyn Glick History Center, a museum in downtown Indianapolis for historical artifacts that also hosts many cultural events, serves as the headquarters of the Indiana Historical Society. The center was built in 1999 and reopened and renamed in 2010 in honor of the Glick‚Äôs $8 million gift to the project. In 2007, Gene and Marilyn gave $30 million to Indiana University to establish the Glick Eye Institute, which houses the Department of Ophthalmology at the IU School of Medicine. Gene Glick had previously established an IU scholarship program in his name. In conjunction with the Indianapolis Public Library Foundation, the Glicks created the Indiana Authors Award recognizing notable Indiana writers beginning in 2009. In 2017, the Glick Fund gave a grant to the local NPR affiliate, WFYI, to fund a reporter position covering issues of poverty and health. Other notable institutions to receive Glick donations include the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, United Way of Central Indiana, Riley Children‚Äôs Hospital, Second Helpings, the Indianapolis Art Center, Ball State University and TeenWorks, a job-training program for local underprivileged teens that Gene Glick launched in the 1980s. Glick received numerous personal awards and honors during his lifetime. He received the Sagamore of the Wabash, the state of Indiana‚Äôs highest civilian award at the time, on three occasions ‚Äì in 1982, 1992 and 2005 ‚Äì making him one of only four people to receive the Sagamore three or more times. He was named an Indiana Living Legend by the Indiana Historical Society in 2002. The Indiana Chapter of the National Society of Fund Raising Executives, now known as the Association of Fundraising Professionals, gave him their Lifetime Achievement Award. He was a member of both the National Housing Hall of Fame and the Central Indiana Business Hall of Fame. Glick received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Butler University in 1992.

History  Maria Luise Thurmair wrote \\"\\" in Innsbruck in 1941, the year of her marriage to the hymnwriter Georg Thurmair. It was then a hymn in seven stanzas about the influence of the Holy Spirit, written for the Innsbruck hymnal Gotteslob (or Innsbrucker Gesangbuch). It was published in 1946 by Christophorus, part of Herder in Freiburg. The song appeared in the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob in 1975 as GL 249, in four stanzas with a 1609 melody by Melchior Vulpius.

The four stanzas are in bar form, each Abgesang ending on Halleluja. The first stanza describes creation as being filled with God's spirit, filled with light and rejoicing. The second stanza notes that the Spirit awakes the spirit of visionaries and prophets. The third stanza reflects Jesus rescuing Earth (\\"die Erde zu erl√∂sen\\"). The last stanza uses images of the spirit as storm throughout the world with a breath of fire, making God's Kingdom alive (\\"wird Gottes Reich lebendig\\"). The tune in 6/4 time is a lively dance.

This potato, of the petite heirloom fingerling type, was grown for over two centuries by the Makah tribe native to Washington and was \\"rediscovered\\" in the late 1980s. The name \\"Ozette\\" is derived from one of the original five villages of the Makah tribe.  Description  The tubers of the Ozette grow to be between 3 and 7 inches in length with an irregular shape, elongated and slightly lumpy. Its form is covered in thin, tan colored skin speckled with brown freckling and deep set eyes. The flesh of the Ozette potato is creamy white and firm. When cooked, the Ozette develops a dense yet creamy texture and offers a rich, slightly sweet and earthy flavor with nuances of roasted chestnuts.  History  Based on tribal accounts and historical evidence, the most likely origin of the potato into the Pacific Northwest was via an incursion of Spaniards in the region at the end of the 18th century. In 1792, a Spanish fort was built by Salvador Fidalgo in Nu√±ez Gaona, now Neah Bay, on the northwest coast of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. A garden was then planted which contained several New World crops including the potato and tomato, brought directly from South America by Spanish ships. It is believed that the Makah traded for or otherwise acquired the crop from the Spanish at this time, prior to the fort's abandonment the following spring. In the 1860s, a schoolteacher who lived among Makah, James Swan, indicated that the potato was a staple of the tribe's diet alongside fish, seal, and whale oil. The potato was not grown outside of Makah gardens until the 1980s, when it was marketed independently by a seed vendor in Idaho (Ronniger's Potato Farm) under the name of Ozette. In 1988, the potato of Macahs was introduced to the Potato Introduction Station Collection at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin as the Swedish Colony, its presumed origin having been attributed to a former Swedish establishment set on Ozette Lake. Since 1990, samples of this potato collected in collaboration with the Makah tribe have been preserved in tissue culture at the United States Department of Agriculture / Agricultural Research Service lab in Prosser. In 2006, a partnership was formed to increase production and promote this potato variety. Partners include the Slow Food Association's Seattle chapter, the Makah Nation, local farmers, the Seattle Chefs Collaborative, and a USDA certified seed laboratory.  Genetic Origin  The Ozette is a traditional variety whose precise genetic origin is unknown. However, a phylogenetic analysis conducted at Washington State University confirmed that it was imported directly from South America, while all other varieties grown in the United States are derived from imports from Europe.

He has worked in the media of painting, drawing, and sculpture. Guffogg lives and works between Los Angeles and Strathmore, California. Early life and education Guffogg was born in Los Angeles on the 12th of August 1962. At the age of four, he and his family moved to Lindsay, a small farming town in the San Joaquin Valley. In 1975, his family moved to Strathmore, the neighboring town, because they bought an exotic bird farm. He worked on the farm during his teen years. In the late 1970s Guffogg realized his passion for art and convinced his parents to let him build a studio on the farm. After graduating high school in 1980, Guffogg traveled around Europe visiting various art museums for two months. That fall, he began studying art in a local community college in the Tulare County area. In fall of 1983, he entered the fine arts program at California Institute of the Arts, also known as ‚ÄúCal Arts.‚Äù Attending Cal Arts was a recommendation by artist, Joe Goode after Guffogg visited his studio earlier that year. Douglas Huebler became Guffogg's mentor at Cal Arts because of his influence in the conceptual art movement. He received his B.F.A. from Cal Arts in 1985. He was an assistant to Ed Ruscha and Joe Goode from 1989 until 1995.  Work  Guffogg's works consist of mediums such as oils on canvas or paper, watercolors, gouache, pastels on paper, and traditional etchings on zinc plates. The size of Guffogg's pieces can range anywhere between 10‚Äù x 8‚Äù to 10‚Äô x 8‚Äô. The paintings with oils typically have as many as 60 to 70 layers of translucent colors. These colors are mixed with a glazing medium that gives these works an illuminated look. This particular process of layering is customary of the Masters and shows how Guffogg's work is rooted in ways of historical European painting techniques. After visiting the work of the Master's in person during his European travels, Guffogg came to the realization that art is a language in itself as it can explain certain things words cannot. As a result, his works can be thought to be its own language of signs and symbols through its patterns, visual depth and light; which can, in turn, emit emotion to the viewer and hints to Quantum Physics and Super String Theory. = Early Influences = Guffogg's attraction to art began at an early age. In the late 1960s his mother would take him to the library to check out books. Many of these books were art books with pictures of the art created by the masters, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, and Van Gogh. He saw their works as magic and wanted to be a part of that. From then on he was always drawing or painting. Guffogg said, ‚ÄúI would look at a tube [of paint] and smell it and dab a little bit on my fingers and wonder how artists could take this substance and make it into a work of art. I thought it was like alchemy, like magic. So I always wanted to be a magician in that regard.‚Äù His fascination with the masters and art only continued as he flew to Europe the day after he graduated high school to finally see the works he had admired in person. He visited the National Gallery in London and was inspired to create a self- portrait of himself in Rembrandt's style after seeing Rembrandt's portrait. However, it was not until he saw ‚ÄúThe Last Supper‚Äù in Milan where he knew he would be an artist. After that summer, Guffogg enrolled in Porterville College where he put all his focus on painting and studied art history. He felt that it was important to study art history because he felt that it was essential to understanding the art world if one wanted to be a part of it. He looked at it as if it were a conversation that had gone on for years and in order to be fully immersed in it, he must understand how the dialogue began. At the same time, he was curious about Einstein's theory of relativity and space. After studying at CalArts he returned to Strathmore to live with his family and began painting fruit at the family's farm. This homecoming changed his thoughts of how he could contribute to the dialogue of the masters. Guffogg explained, ‚ÄúI began wondering what thoughts look like before we attach language to them. I was also wanting to make paintings that hover between abstraction and realism ‚Äì between what we see and what we sense.‚Äù = New York City = In 1985, he was chosen by Huebler and other faculty members at CalArts to attend an internship in New York where he could work at a gallery, museum, or as an artist assistant. Guffogg chose to work alongside New York artist, Gary Stephan. The internship lasted around six months, Guffogg chose to focus on learning and watching Stephan work and chose to make no artwork during this time. = Pharmaka = In 2003, Guffogg began meeting weekly with fellow artists John Scane and Vonn Sumner, and art dealer, Adam Gross, discussing art and the LA art scene. Guffogg created a manifesto for the group that explained the ideas discussed within the group. The manifesto became a constitution which would be called Pharmaka. The name Pharmaka was utilized after their dialogue became public when they opened it up through three exhibitions in Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Los Feliz. The Pharmaka non-profit gallery space opened in Downtown Los Angeles in 2004 and stayed until 2009. This space was used for different exhibitions and to continue to open up the dialogue of the current state of contemporary art for artists and curators. Guffogg's involvement in Pharmaka allowed him to become a pillar in the arts community. During this period, Guffogg lectured at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), Pharmaka, and the Orange County's Art Crowd. Additionally, he curated numerous exhibitions and had a strong voice in the Los Angeles art community. As a result, he was given a position on the board of the downtown neighborhood council to represent art, culture, and education. He also became a chair for the Downtown Arts Committee. = Pattern Paintings = Guffogg began creating his pattern paintings in the 90's. These works are created through 70 to 80 layers of translucent oil paint on canvas in order for the pieces to display illumination from within. What is different about the pattern paintings is that Guffogg paints a pattern over his usual pattern found in other works. The patterns are painted lightly and look as if a painted lace was draped over Guffogg's work. He creates the patterns seen in these works by starting at the left-hand corner and working his way across the canvas. This method of applying the pattern to the painting shows Guffogg's attention to conscious and subconscious perceptions and his fascination with the way the human psyche operates. As a result, the viewer can see dancing light within the work veiled by a lace-like pattern. At the Still Point of the Turning World: The Statesman and the Rulers, 2017 by Shane Guffogg, Oil on Canvas, 60\\" x 48\\" = At the Still Point of the Turning World = Guffogg began his At the Still Point series in 2009. The series was inspired and its name was taken from T.S. Eliot's poem, ‚ÄòBurnt Norton (No. 1 of Four Quartets).‚Äô He first read the poem, years previous to the series‚Äô creation, however, he returned to it because Guffogg feels that the poem addresses his concerns about the art world and the world of painting in the 21st century. Guffogg stated, ‚Äúfor me this is a continuous conversation between past and present, and about creating movement out of stillness in order to make the abstract real.‚Äù Although most works in the abstract movement are about flattening of pictorial space and denying the Renaissance window, in this series Guffogg's goal was to create it. The movement of light through the ribbons in the series documents his own physicality through brushstrokes seen within the paintings. The ribbons create a web through each movement of the brush as each movement requires a counter movement so balance occurs within the piece. As a result, it makes the viewer think the web consists of a single line. He was also inspired by William Turner's seascapes that were made from 1835 to 1846, Mark Rothko's last works on paper, pieces by Rembrandt, and Jasper John's early ‚ÄòAlphabet‚Äô paintings. Guffogg sees this series as a conversation with the artists that inspired him. Ginevra de Benci #10, 2011, by Shane Guffogg, Oil on Canvas, 80\\" x 60\\" = Ginevra de Benci = Guffogg's Ginevra de Benci series of paintings are inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's \\"Ginevra de Benci‚Äù painting. The series was created following Guffogg's ‚ÄúAt the Still Point Series‚Äù and is thought of as an evolution of that series. The portrait by Leonardo da Vinci is on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. The series by Guffogg consists of fifty-two oil on canvas pieces that are meant to symbolize a conversation between Guffogg and Da Vinci. Each painting in the series is titled Ginevra de Benci then numbered. The series appeared in Guffogg's 2013 exhibition, titled, ‚ÄúThe Annunciation of Ginevra de‚ÄôBenci: Conversations with Leonardo.‚Äù The series displays Guffogg's illuminated ribbon motif created in combination with oil paint and resin. The combination of these two materials gives these paintings bursts of light. The tangled ribbons give hints at Leonardo's portrait of de Benci and feminine shape. One can see how Guffogg utilizes abstraction and string theory, modern mathematical and scientific tools, and how Da Vinci utilized classicism and science and math of his time within his work. Lumen Lapsis II #2, 2013 by Shane Guffogg, Pastel on Paper, 16\\" x 12\\" = Lumen Lapsis = \\"Lumen Lapsis\\" series consists of pastels on paper. In Latin, ‚Äúlumen lapsis‚Äù means, ‚Äúlight falling‚Äù. This name is meant to capture the use of light, which is always present in Guffogg's artwork. Additionally, these works utilize light to display the cascading colors of the medium. Lumen Lapsis is also meant to display ‚Äúthought and process‚Äù, working simultaneously, as Guffogg is able to manifest these pieces over one sitting, completing a dialogue with each work. While creating, Guffogg believes he is able to truly connect with each pastel, unlike oils, that need to be worked over a number of sessions, and take time to dry, pastels allow him to create dimensional layers, as there is no drying time and it allows him to create a ‚Äúpure moment.‚Äù = Murano Glass = ‚ÄúThe Fifth Sound‚Äù is the name of Guffogg's Murano glass pieces. The inspiration that would later create this series came to Guffogg in 1997. He began drawing the negative space between the ribbons found in his oil paintings. Then Guffogg would fold the paper with the drawing of negative space in half then cut out the shape would appear as a mirrored image. These shapes created from negative space in his paintings spurred the idea of creating sculptures and would later become templates for the Murano glass series, ‚ÄúThe Fifth Sound.‚Äù In 2004, Guffogg was approached by a Venetian art dealer that was looking to have a California artist collaborate with a Murano glass master. He then pursued this opportunity and went to Venice. There, he learned the history of Murano glassmaking. He collaborated with the glass master to display this negative space found with in his oil paintings in a three- dimensional sculpture form. Guffogg and the glass master proceeded with this, and ‚ÄúThe Fifth Sound‚Äù Murano glass series came to fruition. Guffogg sees these pieces as extensions of his two-dimensional work. These pieces are hand blown and then sanded down so they appear more opaque. Some pieces in the series are also mirror coated as well.The Fifth Sound 1 of 7, 2014 by Shane Guffogg, Clear Crystal Murano Glass, Hand Blown and Sanded, 18\\" x 11\\" x 11\\"  Collections  * Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA * Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, Durham, NC * Fresno Art Museum, Fresno, CA * Fundaci√≥n Jumex, Mexico City * Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, CA * Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, CA * St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, NY * Van Pelt-Dietrich Library, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA * Frederick R.

The barn is unusually tall for its time. In order to provide additional stability, it employs two tall canted (leaning) posts along with the more common vertical posts in its construction, which is unusual for a barn of this type. The canted posts support a secondary girt below the principal tie beam instead of the principal beam itself. The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

The charity went on to open three orphanages in China, called Lily Orphan Care Centers, and helped to train orphanage care workers. After Chinese policy allowed foster care, the organization began to train foster care parents and families and helped to place children in foster homes in China. The organization actively places special-needs children in American homes, as well. They have also established bilingual Chinese agents in all provinces of China, and they help facilitate adoptions.

Self-absorbed to the point of existential withdrawal, the gentle and mildly eccentric Abel confers upon all events a kind of mystical grandeur and perplexity. (The film opens with a slogan on a blackboard: \\"I want to change the course of things ‚Äì but it is things which change me.\\") One day he makes breakfast, behaving in a somewhat odd manner as he prepares to go out. He visits his dying mother (Monique Champagne) in hospital and learns that his father (who had left them and is living in Brazil) has sent him $10,000. Later, by chance, he meets Mary (Suzanne Grossman), an old girlfriend he has not seen for five years. She is about to be married in Paris. He returns home to wait for Madeleine (), his current girlfriend, and the hospital calls to tell him his mother has died. This intimate, gently comic, ironic and poetic meditation on individualism and fatalism is the third feature from Lefebvre, the first to win him international praise, and is one of his most appealing.

Cochran, an agnostic, was inspired by his daughter's Sunday school class, where the subject was discussed. Another exhibit ran from December 19, 1999 through February 6, 2000, which featured five large art installations, 10 large cast- iron dessert platters, including a Spanish Collar, an oversized birdcage, candy-colored children's bathtubs, and a floor covered with 240 clogs. Spanish Collar and Dutch Shoes were part of Cochran's Dutch Journal work, an art project originally attended for the Netherlands. The 52 inches high by 15 feet wide Spanish Collar consisted of towels fastened around a center. Dutch Shoes had 240 pairs of shoes, which were originally made by a Dutch shoemaker from Cochran's eight prototype designs. The immaculate shoes were only characterized by their sizes and distortions. Cochran's Goodale Park Fountain located in Columbus, Ohio was recognized as the most captivating art projects of 2013 by the Public Art Network Year in Review program. He designed it based on the park's history and the Sell's Brother \\"Circus House\\". The two elephants on top of the fountain are a salute to the history of Columbus' Sells Brothers Circus. In 2016, Malcolm Cochran was the project coordinator for two distinctive parking lot attendants' booths in downtown Columbus. Malcolm was awarded the International Sculpture Center's Outstanding Educator Award for 2017, with the nomination coming from a former student. Winners are selected based on their profession combining their personal creative practice and scholarly achievement. For 27 years, Cochran taught at Ohio State University, Department of Art in Foundation Studies and Sculpture, and retired in 2013. Getting an International Sculpture Award was never the incentive for Cochran's exceptional teaching practice, in which he stated, \\"I wanted to be a good teacher, but you can't walk into a classroom and think, 'Boy if I'm really good today, I might get an award.\\" References  External links * * International Sculpture Center Outstanding Educator Award Winners (Malcolm Cochran, 2017) * Malcolm Cochran, OSU Department of Art Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:21st-century American sculptors Category:21st- century male artists Category:Artists from Columbus, Ohio Category:Artists from Pittsburgh Category:Sculptors from Connecticut Category:American male sculptors Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Sculptors from Michigan Category:Sculptors from Pennsylvania Category:Sculptors from Ohio ","title":"Malcolm Cochran"},{"id":"54013451","text":"The 1996 Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team represented the University of Southern Mississippi in the 1996 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Plot  Walter, 53, with Down syndrome was hidden by his parents and managed to survive the Nazi period The theme of the film is the call for the killing of mentally ill patients: \\"Inherited mental illness\\" is the \\"greatest public health hazard.\\" Whoever is \\"afflicted\\" bears \\"the heavy burden of fate: an existence without life\\". Embedded in the plot is a brief history of psychiatry. A professorIn Germany this title means exclusively Full professor, which is important, as at that time, much more than today, the professor was an authority for most people. named \\"K√§mpfer\\" (English: \\"fighter\\") tells two students about the successes achieved in the treatment of mentally ill patients via electro-shock and insulin shock therapy. Shortly before the turn of the 20th century, many new institutions were established in order to accommodate an ever-increasing number of patients. In the setting of the film, there are 1,000 institutions with about 500,000 patients, which have to be cared for by 2,000 physicians and 40,000 nurses. The patients are accommodated in historic buildings in beautiful landscape, none of which is appreciated by the patients. The second line of argumentation is the suggestive presentation of sick individuals via voice-over. A group of \\"idiots\\" in Hartheim Euthanasia Centre is described as follows: \\"We see here their future destiny, as if reflected in a funhouse mirror\\". A group of \\"idiots\\" in Kindberg, also a euthanasia centre, are \\"crippled in body and soul, miserable wretches, a burden to both themselves and to others, like ghosts without a will, imagination, or feeling.\\" Further examples from other institutions follow, including Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre. The director of a \\"large lunatic asylum\\" appears as an expert: 73% of the parents of his \\"incurable inmates\\" were allegedly in favor of \\"redeeming\\" them.  Filmmaking  The director was Hermann Schwenninger, one of the three managing directors of Gemeinn√ºtzige Krankentransport (\\"Charitable Ambulance\\"), a front company of Aktion T4, the central institution for the mass murder of patients in the Third Reich. Schwenninger also wrote parts of the screenplay of Ich klage an. The contract for the film came from Hitler's Chancellery, and was produced by Tobis Film. Gas chamber in Hadamar For the filmmaking, Schwenninger shot the complete course of the NS euthanasia program, including the transport of the frightened patients to the killing institutions, and through an observation window the murder in a gas chamber of the center Pirna- Sonnenstein. During the one and a half year of production, the film team visited 20 to 30 institutions throughout Nazi Germany.The murders were performed in Grafeneck, Brandenburg an der Havel (Altes Zuchthaus), Bernburg, Hadamar, Hartheim, Pirna-Sonnenstein in Germany an in Chelmno in Poland.  Film screening  The film only screened in closed circles. In March 1942, the film was premiered in front of 28 physicians.

Voir, October 14, 1998. the film follows Abel () on a journey to France to visit the land of his ancestors. Synopsis Abel leaves Montreal for a visit to France, the country of his ancestors. In Paris he encounters several people, from a taxi-driver to a haute bourgeoisie family. He visits Jeanne (Myriam Boyer), a young widow who lives with her daughter (Viviane Lesser) and works in a garment factory. When Jeanne‚Äôs mother hangs herself they leave for Charleville, their hometown and Rimbaud‚Äôs birthplace, where Abel meets Jeanne‚Äôs drunkard father (Roger Blin). Abel leaves for the Cote d‚ÄôAzur where he meets Anne (Anouk Ferjac), a children‚Äôs court judge whose relationship with her husband (Fran√ßois Perrot) has deteriorated. They have an affair, during which Anne confesses her unhappiness. Abel returns to Quebec. Cast * Marcel Sabourin : Abel * Anouk Ferjac : Anne * Myriam Boyer : Jeanne * Roger Blin : Jeanne's father * Fran√ßois Perrot : Anne's husband Importance In 2001 the Toronto International Film Festival programmed a Lefebvre retrospective in conjunction with the publication of Jean Pierre Lefebvre, Vid√©aste by Peter Harcourt. In the program notes for the film Harcourt wrote, ‚ÄúConceived as a continuation of Lefebvre‚Äôs Il ne faut mourir pour √ßa, Le Vieux pays o√π Rimbaud est mort tells the story of Abel, who travels to France on a personal quest. Enraptured by the cultural aesthetics of Rimbaud and C√©zanne, Abel longs to discover the link, if any, between the ‚Äòglories‚Äô of France and his uncertain identity as a Qu√©b√©cois. On his journey to the locations where Arthur Rimbaud was born, lived and died, Abel encounters a variety of French people who represent in their different ways the various regions of their nation. These encounters put into context for Abel the place, or placelessness of his own identity.‚Äù Le Vieux pays o√π Rimbaud est mort remains a poetic commentary on how Canadians are perhaps still fighting the old colonial battles with European powers. Reception This official Canada-France co-production, which was shown in competition at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival, is certainly one of the director‚Äôs accessible films, but it did less well in commercial distribution than it deserved. Made as the Parti Qu√©b√©cois came to power, it was unfashionably critical of Quebec‚Äôs colonial relationship to France. ‚ÄúFilm skirts banality in its mixture of satirical and mainly black and white looks at France by this fairly simple and direct Quebecoise of French origin. But there is a certain charm and perceptiveness, in broad strokes, about the mixture of French generosity and lack of it.‚Äù Variety ‚ÄúBy turns gay and sad, and for the most part languorously beautiful, its beauty remains as separate from its Quebecois hero as the C√©zanne paintings on the museum walls. The France of his ancestors, the France he has come to find, exists only in the museums and in his imagination. And it is Lefebvre‚Äôs genius that he has invented a visual language for describing this shadowy terrain between the public gallery and corridors of the mind.‚Äù Take One References External links * Category:1977 films Category:Films directed by Jean Pierre Lefebvre Category:Films set in France Category:Canadian drama films Category:Canadian films ","title":"The Old Country Where Rimbaud Died"},{"id":"54013529","text":"The Buresh Farm is located west of Solon, Iowa, United States, along the north shore of Lake McBride.

The Priseman Seabrook Collection of 21st Century British Painting is the only art collection in the United Kingdom dedicated to painting produced in Britain after the year 2000 and was exhibited publicly for the first time in 2014 at the Huddersfield Art Gallery while works from the other two elements of the collection were first displayed at the Minories Art Gallery in Colchester during 2016. Subsequent exhibition loans have been made to the China Academy of Art, Hangzhou, The University of Suffolk, The Cut, Halesworth Jiangsu Art Gallery, Nanjing, Artall, Nanjing, Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, Tianjin and Yantai Art Museum, China. The focus of each collection is placed on painting and drawing made by hand, with the emphasis being designed to explore and question the relevance of the handmade work of art in the period of the digital revolution.

She worked directly with Jose Marti. Life Pedroso's parents were born slaves, but she was born free in Pinar del R√≠o in 1845. Her parents were active in seeking Cuban independence. She married at a very young age, and Pedroso is her married surname. In 1860, she moved with her husband Ruberto to Havana. She was fifteen at the time. In 1892, she moved to Ybor City with her husband. Afterward, they went to Key West, Florida. She and her husband worked in the cigar industry in Tampa, Florida, and also ran a boarding house. Jose Marti often stayed in her boarding house in Tampa, and it was a place where they could openly discuss their plans for the war effort. Marti referred to Pedroso as his second mother. Pedroso died in 1925, when she was eighty. Her home in Ybor City became a shrine, and her home in Tampa is now a park. Activism Pedroso was heavily involved in activism. She aided other black Cubans in forming La Sociedad Libres, along with her husband. The group was formed to arm rebels against the Spanish government for the liberation of Cuba. This organization eventually became the Sociedad La Union Marti-Maceo. Pedroso also worked for racial equality in North America, and she collaborated with Marti on this matter. The two famously strolled arm-in-arm in the city, during a time of extreme racial tension. Pedroso was Afro-Cuban, and Marti was White-Hispanic. After Cuban independence was won in 1898, she eventually returned to Cuba when a 1910 workers' strike in the tobacco factories was underway. The Cuban government honored her service during that time, and in appreciation, Pedroso and her husband lived rent-free in Cuba for the rest of their lives. She was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1993, and on her first nomination, which is something that is not achieved often.

Naganori injured Yoshihisa with his katana. This was seen as an irreverence by the shogunate. Naganori received the penalty of Seppuku and died.

On 3 November 1082, the Normans besieged the city of Larissa. In July of the following year, Byzantine reinforcements attacked the blockading force, harassing it with mounted archers and spreading discord among its ranks through diplomatic techniques. The demoralized Normans were forced to break off the siege. Background The Normans first arrived in Southern Italy in 1015 from northern France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As they were paid with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Pope at the Battle of Civitate, forcing him to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, the Pope made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands. By 1071, Robert, together with his brother Roger, had taken over the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 1.12. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 1.12. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy. Robert conscripted all men of a fighting age into the army, which he refitted. Meanwhile, he sent an ambassador to the Byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for Helena and to win over the Domestic of the Schools, Alexios Komnenos.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 1.15. The results of these attempts remain unknown, but the ambassador fell under Alexios's charm and as he was returning to Italy, he heard of Alexios's successful coup against Botaneiates, by which he became emperor. When the ambassador returned, he urged Robert to make peace, claiming that Alexios wanted nothing but friendship with the Normans. Robert had no intention of peace; he sent his son Bohemond with an advance force towards Greece and Bohemond landed at Aulon, with Robert following shortly after.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 1.15. On 18 October 1081, the Byzantines under Alexios suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Historian Jonathan Harris states that the defeat was \\"every bit as severe as that at Manzikert.\\" Alexios lost about 5,000 of his men, including most of the Varangians. Norman losses are unknown, but John Haldon claims they too were substantial as both wings broke and fled. Historian Robert Holmes states: \\"The new knightly tactic of charging with the lance couched ‚Äì tucked firmly under the arm to unite the impact of man and horse ‚Äì proved a battle-winner. George Palaiologos had not been able to re-enter the city after the battle and left with the main force. The defense of the citadel was left to the Venetians, while the city itself was left to the Count of the Tent mobilizing from Arbanon (i.e., ·ºêŒæ ·ºàœÅŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩœâŒΩ ·ΩÅœÅŒºœâŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâ ŒöŒøŒºŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÅœÑŒ∑; the term ŒöŒøŒºŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÅœÑŒ∑ is short for Œ∫œåŒºŒ∑œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∫œåœÅœÑŒ∑œÇ meaning \\"Count of the Tent\\").Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 4.8. In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfitan citizen opened the gates to the Normans.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 5.1. The Norman army proceeded to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, Calabria, and Campania were in revolt. He also learned that the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, was at the gates of Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.Anna Comnena, The Alexiad, 5.3. Alexios, desperate for money, ordered the confiscation of all the church's treasure. With this money, Alexios mustered an army near Thessalonica and went to fight Bohemond. However, Bohemond defeated Alexios in two battles: one near Arta and the other near Ioannina. This left Bohemond in control of Macedonia and nearly all of Thessaly.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 5.4. Battle On 3 November 1082, Bohemond advanced from his encampment in Trikala to lay siege to the city of Larissa. Next to nothing is known about the course of the siege or the city's fortifications. Larissa's governor Leo Kephalas, an experienced officer, sent a letter to Alexios requesting urgent assistance six months into the siege (April 1083), as the siege had begun to take its toll on the defenders. The Byzantines then resorted to organizing a plot within the Norman army, spearheaded by the officers Peter of Aulps, Renaldus, and William, who were accused of attempting to defect. In the early winter of 1082, Alexios managed to obtain a mercenary force of 7,000 soldiers from the Seljuq Turkish sultan Suleiman ibn Qutulmish. The contingent was led by a general named Kamyres. Alexios continued to raise troops in Constantinople, while in late 1082 the Patriarch of Jerusalem Euthymius was sent to Thessalonica, where he mustered an additional force and attempted to broker a deal with the Normans. In March 1083, Alexios departed from Constantinople at the head of an army which marched towards Larissa. The army advanced through the narrow Tempe Valley, camping at Plabitza on the bank of the Peneius. The Byzantines avoided a direct engagement with the Normans, passing south-west of Larissa and arriving at Trikala in early April, without encountering any resistance. Byzantine scouts managed to apprehend a local man, who provided them with crucial information about the topography of the areas surrounding Larissa. The poor morale and lack of military experience of the Byzantine troops necessitated the use of guile to defeat the Normans. A day later, the generals Nikephoros Melissenos and Basil Kourtikios approached Larissa from the east while bearing the imperial standard. In the account of John Zonaras Alexios' brother Adrian commands this decoy force wearing imperial garb leading the Normans to believe that they have engaged the main force under the command of the emperor. Following a brief engagement the Byzantines made a feigned retreat, leading the unsuspecting Normans to a place called Lykostomion (Wolf's Mouth), where Alexios awaited with a unit of elite cavalry. Bohemond and the Count of Brienne's cavalry charged towards the imperial standard. When a small force of peltasts (light infantry) and mounted archers began to harass them from another direction, Brienne's cavalry turned their attention towards them. Suffering casualties, the cavalrymen broke off the engagement. Meanwhile, Behemond had established his camp on the river islet of Salabria, eating grapes (pointing out that the engagement probably happened in late July). The following day, the Turkish and \\"Sarmatian\\" (probably Pecheneg) mounted archers returned, this time raiding Bohemond's camp. The Normans decided to stand their ground and formed a phalanx. Panic ensued when the Norman flag bearer was killed, prompting their retreat to Trikala. Aftermath Discord continued to spread in the Norman army, as its officers demanded two and half years worth of payment arrears, a sum Bohemond did not possess. The bulk of the Norman army returned to the coast and sailed back to Italy, leaving only a small garrison at Kastoria.Anna Comnena. The Alexiad, 5.7 Alexios granted the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople, as well as exemption from trading duties in return for their renewed aid. They responded by recapturing Dyrrhachium and Corfu and returning them to the Byzantine Empire. These victories returned the Empire to its previous status quo and marked the beginning of the Komnenian restoration. See also *Feint Footnotes References * * Comnena, Anna (translated by E. R. A.

He worked at the Swedish History Museum and the Swedish National Heritage Board, as a research director among other positions. Ambrosiani led a number of excavations at different sites. In the 1960s he led the excavations at Henriksdalsberget, and from 1969‚Äì71 and again from 1990‚Äì95 he was responsible for excavations of the Viking-age trading center Birka. The first project was the first at Birka since that led by Hjalmar Stolpe in the 1870s. Early life and education Bj√∂rn Ambrosiani was born on 8 March 1928. In 1947, before matriculating at university, he spent two months working under Gunnar Ekelund as an archaeological Ô¨Åeld surveyor in √ñsterg√∂tland. The experience inspired him to study archaeology, in addition to history, when he subsequently enrolled in Uppsala University. While at Uppsala he helped with seminar excavations at Valsg√§rde, and, as an assistant at the university's Institution of Archaeology, excavated in Darsg√§rde (sv) before the area's exploitation. Career Photograph by Ambrosiani of excavations at Birka in 1991 When Ambrosiani graduated in 1952, he began work with the Riksantikvarie√§mbetet (Swedish National Heritage Board), including a stint at the Statens historiska museum. His work included both administrative work in Stockholm, and excavations in northern Sweden prior to the installation of hydropower projects. In 1955, he received his licentiate degree, writing on women‚Äôs jewelry from the late Vendel Period. The next year he returned to Darsg√§rde, and following that, he led excavations in southern Sweden on behalf of the Riksantikvarie√§mbetet's Department of Ancient Monuments. This resulted in the formation of a new department, known as UV (for UppdragsVerksamheten or Unders√∂kningsVerksamheten, literally \\"mission operations\\" or \\"survey operations\\"), which Ambrosiani described as \\"a new department that carried out development led, commissioned archaeological excavations.\\" Ambrosiani soon became the head of the Swedish National Heritage Board, filling the role from 1959 until 1974. Ambrosiani received his Pd.D. in 1964, with the dissertation Fornl√§mningar och Bebyggelse (Ancient Monuments and Settlement). It was termed one of the most innovative of the twentieth century. The field of academic archaeology was still relatively new in Sweden; only a few decades earlier, wrote Ambrosiani, students defending their dissertations were \\"occasions which the whole of Sweden‚Äôs archaeological world turned out to witness.\\" Six years later, in 1970, he was appointed an associate professor at Stockholm University. From 1975 until 1987 he was the head of the Museum Department, and head of research, at Statens historiska museer. Starting in 1990 and through 1995, Ambrosiani was also the project manager for the excavations at Birka, a Viking Age trading center. Ambrosiani received the Monteliusmedaljen (sv) (the Oscar Montelius medal) in 2004. Publications * Fornl√§mningar och bebyggelse.

Although formed by former Caucasus Emirate fighters and tentatively linked to the organization, Ajnad al-Kavkaz operated fully autonomous from the beginning and later cut its links with the Caucasus Emirate. By September 2016, Ajnad al- Kavkaz had become \\"the largest of the Muslim factions from the former Soviet Union fighting in Syria.\\"  History  = Foundation = In course of the Second Chechen War's last phase around 2009, numerous Caucasus Emirate fighters temporarily moved to Turkey, often for medical treatment, but were thereafter unable to return to Russia to continue their insurgency. Thus stranded, the militants settled down in Turkey and Syria in involuntary exile, though continued to plan their eventual return to their homelands in North Caucasus. Their situation changed dramatically, however, when the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011, as the Chechen militants picked up their weapons again, formed many militias and joined local Syrian Islamists in their rebellion against Bashar al-Assad's government. The two small militias which later founded Ajnad al-Kavkaz were initially active in the Latakia and Quneitra Governorates: The first one was Jamaat al-Khilafa al-Qawqazia (\\"the Caucasian Caliphate Group\\"), which had been founded in 2013 and was led by Abdul Hakim Shishani. Abdul Hakim had been commander of the central sector of the Caucasus Emirate's Vilayat Nokhchicho in 2007‚Äì09, and his unit consisted of veterans of the Second Chechen War. The second one was Jamaat Jund al-Qawqaz (\\"Group of Soldiers of the Caucasus\\"), a small militia of Islamist Circassians from the Golan Heights and Jordan, which soon pledged allegiance (bay'ah) to Abdul Hakim. Both were initially members of Ansar al-Sham, and were loosely affiliated with the Caucasus Emirate. The two groups eventually left Ansar al- Sham in 2014, while Jamaat Jund al-Qawqaz was strengthened when Ahrar al- Sharkas (\\"The Free Circassians\\") in Quneitra joined their group in November 2014. The two groups eventually fully merged under Abdul Hakim's leadership in spring 2015 and adopted the name \\"Ajnad al-Kavkaz\\". = Operations with the Army of Conquest = Ajnad al-Kavkaz fighters during the Second Battle of Idlib. Due to their close cooperation with other Jihadist groups during this conflict, Ajnad al-Kavkaz was labelled a \\"terrorist\\" organization in the West, much to the consternation of the group. Ajnad al-Kavkaz went on to join the Army of Conquest, an alliance of Islamist rebel groups led by the al-Nusra Front, and became an \\"integral component\\" of it. The militia participated in the large-scale rebel offensive in 2015 that aimed at fully conquering Idlib Governorate from the Assad government. Fighting alongside other Chechen fighters, 45 Ajnad al-Kavkaz militants acted as elite shock troops for the rebels during the Second Battle of Idlib. In course of the following Northwestern Syria offensive (April‚ÄìJune 2015), Ajnad al-Kavkaz helped to capture the Al-Mastumah military base, and fought at Kafr Najad and Muqabala. In May 2015, Ajnad al-Kavkaz officially declared that it was not part of or affiliated with the Caucasus Emirate or any other militant organization, instead being simply allied with numerous Syrian rebel groups. In course of the 2015‚Äì16 Latakia offensive, the group claimed to have defended a hilltop against an attack by Russian ground forces. In late June 2016, Ajnad al-Kavkaz strongly condemned an ISIL terror attack against the Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport, reaffirming their stance that the targeting of unarmed civilians is against their principles. Soon after, the group took part in another rebel offensive in Latakia, during which one of its military officials was reportedly killed. When the government responded to the offensive by launching intense counter- attacks, Ajnad al-Kavkaz became involved in brutal fighting for the hills at the village of Ayn Issa. In late 2016, another predominantly North Caucasian militia, Junud al-Sham, largely dissolved, whereupon many of its Chechen fighters joined Ajnad al-Kavkaz. Abdul Hakim Shishani's men went on to take part in a rebel offensive aimed at breaking the siege of insurgent-held eastern Aleppo in late 2016, and other operations in northern Hama Governorate in 2016 and 2017. = Increasing rebel infighting and reduced activity = After the Idlib Governorate clashes between Tahrir al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham in July 2017, Abdul Hakim Shishani and two other Chechen commanders in Syria released a statement in which they declared themselves and their groups neutral, pledging not to interfere in these \\"internecine feuds\\". Abdul Hakim even said \\"May Allah help us not to participate in this [i.e. the infighting among the rebels]\\". After this joint statement, Ajnad al-Kavkaz largely \\"disappeared from public view\\", though it continued to carry out raids against government positions in the western Aleppo Governorate in May and July 2017, cooperating with Malhama Tactical. On 1 October 2017, the militia announced that it would suspend its participation in military operations in Syria until other Islamist groups \\"determine their strategy in the arena of the Syrian jihad\\". Despite this, the militia was one of the rebel groups that announced that they would form a joint operations room to counter a new government offensive in northwestern Syria on 1 January 2018. Ajnad al-Kavkaz also commented on the 2017‚Äì18 Iranian protests on its Telegram channel, noting that the group hoped that these protests would at least disorganize the \\"Shi'ite powers\\" so that perhaps the \\"Shi'te hordes\\" would retreat and be defeated during the fighting in Idlib Governorate like the polytheists were defeated during the Battle of the Trench. On 7 January, a VBIED attack hit Ajnad al- Kavkaz's base in Idlib city, causing extensive damage. Although at least 23 civilians were killed, Ajnad al-Kavkaz suffered no casualties as none of its fighters had been present at the time of the bombing. It was unclear who had carried out the attack or even if it had specifically targeted the Chechen-led militia. As the inter-rebel conflict in Idlib continued to escalate from February 2018, resulting in the Syrian Liberation Front‚ÄìTahrir al-Sham conflict and the formation of the Guardians of Religion Organization, Ajnad al-Kavkaz continued to stay neutral and mostly inactive. By this time, the militia had about 200 fighters. In early August 2018, Abdul Hakim Shishani and Ajnad al-Kavkaz released a statement on the death on Yusup Temerkhanov, the murderer of Yuri Budanov. Like many other Chechens, Abdul acclaimed Temerkhanov as martyr and hero. In November 2018, Ajnad al-Kavkaz reportedly participated in a raid near Khuwayn in southeastern Idlib; the Syrian Army later claimed to have repelled the attack. Russian media claimed in late January 2019 that the Syrian Army had killed Abu Al-Bara al-Kavkazi, an alleged \\"ringleader\\" of Ajnad al-Kavkaz who had been in charge of logistics and recruitment. On 3 March 2019, Khamza Shishani, the deputy emir of the group, was reportedly killed fighting alongside Ansar al-Tawhid in an attack against Syrian government troops in Hama Governorate. This operation did not officially involve Ajnad al-Kavkaz, however, and Khamza probably took part in it as individual fighter. In May 2019, pro-government forces reportedly attacked areas in northern Latakia as part of the Northwestern Syria offensive (April‚ÄìAugust 2019) which had served as Ajnad al-Kavkaz stronghold. The Russian Reconciliation Center for Syria accused Ajnad al-Kavkaz and Tahrir al- Sham of violating the demilitarized zones of Idlib in August 2019. Three months later, Syrian government forces reportedly captured Misherfah in southern Idlib Governorate from a joint garrison of Ajnad al-Kavkaz and Tahrir al-Sham troops. In course of the Northwestern Syria offensive (December 2019‚ÄìMarch 2020), Ajnad al-Kavkaz snipers took part in the defense of Jabal Zawiya against advancing government forces; after the offensive's conclusion, the group was among those rebel factions which allegedly resisted the implementation of a ceasefire.  Structure and tactics  The forested, mountainous areas of Latakia Governorate are well suited to Ajnad al-Kavkaz's type of warfare. Ajnad al-Kavkaz's leadership is dominated by Chechens: the overall leader is Abdul Hakim Shishani (born Rustan Azhiev) who is widely regarded as a very capable and experienced commander, while Khamza Shishani, another veteran of the Second Chechen War, served as his second-in-command. Abu Bakr Shishani, who fought with Ibn al-Khattab in Chechnya, was also a leading member of the group since his desertation from Junud al-Sham in early 2016. He left Ajnad al-Kavkaz in early 2017, however, when he formed his own small unit, Jamaat Seiful Sham. Despite the prominence of Chechens, the militia has also members from other North Caucasian ethnic groups, Syrian Circassians and Arabs. Ajnad al-Kavkaz's structure and tactics largely replicate those of the old North Caucasian guerrilla groups, which allow the group to operate very effectively in the forested, mountainous areas of Latakia. This is because of the great similarities of the Caucasus Mountains with northern Latakia; the latter is even nicknamed \\"Syrian Caucasus\\" by Ajnad al-Kavkaz militants. Despite its small size, the militia has been regarded as \\"the most visible and successful North Caucasian-dominated militant faction in Syria\\". In regards to the group's operations, Abdul Hakim Shishani has said that all enemy armed forces are legitimate targets, but disapproves of attacking unarmed civilians, especially if they are Muslims. Ajnad al-Kavkaz also suffers from shortages in funding, and according to Abdul Hakim receives no outside aid, limiting its ability to successfully operate. In regards to allegiance, Ajnad al-Kavkaz maintains that it is completely independent, and since May 2015 explicitly states that it does not belong to the Caucasus Emirate. Nevertheless, the group generally emphasizes the importance of cooperation and unity among Islamist rebels, and North Caucasian insurgents in particular. It does, however, strongly deny to have ever worked with or being affiliated with ISIL, a charge that was levelled against it by pro-Russian LifeNews.  Ideology  Ajnad al-Kavkaz follows a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist and Jihadist ideology, and wants to spread Islam and the Sharia worldwide. The group's primary aim, however, is to remove the Russian presence in North Caucasus and to establish an Islamic state there, though Abdul Hakim Shishani has claimed that these goals are currently unattainable, primarily due to Russia's power. Instead, he believes that sooner or later a world war against Russia will break out, which would allow the North Caucasians to launch a popular, violent uprising to regain their independence from Russia. According to Abdul Hakim, peaceful protests and resistance, though admirable, will never be able to end the Russian rule of the North Caucasus. Ajnad al- Kavkaz is also critical of the economic situation in Russia, and its members believe that the Russian government uses propaganda to distract its people from the widespread economic problems. Despite this great focus on the eventual conquest of North Caucasus and the reverence for the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as \\"glorious chapter in the history of [the Chechen] nation\\", Abdul Hakim claims that Ajnad al-Kavkaz is not a Chechen nationalist group. Instead, Ajnad al-Kavkaz regards all its activities (including the war against the Assad government) as part of a wider Muslim struggle for freedom and against Russia. Due to these beliefs, Abdul Hakim is very bitter about his group being labelled \\"terrorists\\" at the hands of the West. He says that his men do not \\"kill women, children, or the elderly\\", and that they only \\"want to overthrow tyranny. That‚Äôs all.\\" Notes References Category:Caucasus Emirate Category:History of Chechnya Category:Jihadist groups Category:Pan- Islamism Category:Anti-government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:North Caucasus Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Russia Category:Jihadist groups in Syria Category:Islamism in Chechnya Category:Salafi groups Category:Separatism in Russia Category:Chechen nationalism ","title":"Ajnad al-Kavkaz"},{"id":"54013947","text":"Gulgule are often but not always round Gulgula is traditional sweet made in different regions of India.

Within Millbrook a small section of the river was culverted during the construction of the Salisbury and Southampton Canal. This was filled with concrete in 1964 as part of a flood relief project. Originally the river was joined on the mudflats of Southampton Water by Wimpson Stream but with the mudflats being reclaimed by the expanding docks the Wimpson Stream now joins Tanner's Brook before it reaches Southampton Water.

Titlepage The Gart der Gesundheit (German for Latin hortus sanitatis) was edited in 1485. It was written by Johann Wonnecke von Kaub and it is one of the first printed herbals in German. It was often reprinted until the 18th century. The Gart der Gesundheit is an important late medieval work concerning the knowledge of natural history, especially that of medicinal plants. In 435 chapters 382 plants, 25 drugs from the animal kingdom and 28 minerals are described and illustrated. The book was edited by Peter Sch√∂ffer in Mainz. Together with the Latin Herbarius moguntinus (Peter Sch√∂ffer 1484) and the Latin Hortus sanitatis (Jacob Meydenbach in Mainz 1491), the Gart der Gesundheit belongs to the \\"Group of Mainz herbal incunabula.\\"Arber, Agnes.

The reader cannot rely on the names the author gives to his citations. Sometimes he gives no name, for example for the citations he took from the Physica of Hildegard of Bingen. More often he even gives incorrect names to his citations.Peter Riethe. Hildegards von Bingen >Liber simplicis medicinae< im Mainzer >Gart der Gesundheit<. In: Sudhoffs Archiv.

Erhard Reuwich is supposed to be the creator of these woodcuts, who depict the character of plants in clear lines. Opposing to some modern authors, who called these illustrations ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù in a bad sense, Arnold C. Klebs stated in 1925: :: ‚ÄûWe who today in our aesthetic demands are drawing away more and more from the slavish copying of nature and demand that a work of art expresses type and character, can better appreciate the didactic value of these simple drawings than the previous generation to whom the photographic appealed as the highest form of truthful representation.‚ÄúWilhelm Ludwig Schreiber.

She wrote an autobiography that declared her innocence of these charges. Life Beaumont was born in Edworth near Biggleswade and she was baptised in 1652. Her parents were John and Mary Beaumont of Pirton.W. R. Owens, ‚ÄòBeaumont, Agnes (bap. 1652, d. 1720)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 May 2017 Beaumont's family did not follow the established Christian denomination of Anglicanism so it was unsurprising when she joined a church in Gamlingay led by the evangelist John Bunyan. However her (now widowed) father did not approve and forbade her to get involved. Agnes was given a lift by Bunyan and rode pillion on his horse. John Beaumont then threw her out of the family home, and refused to let her back in unless she promised to stop attending the church meetings. After spending two days outside at the height of winter, she agreed to his demand. This all became notable when her father died the following night. A heart attack is a possible cause of death but a neighbour, Mr. Feery, alleged that she had poisoned her father. In her autobiography Beaumont implied that Feery, a lawyer, had once intended to marry her, but that once she had begun attending church meetings he had \\"turned against me\\". Murder was a capital offence, but Beaumont was found to be not involved by the coroner and his jury. Although Beaumont had escaped being potentially burnt at the stake, rumours abounded that she and Bunyan had been lovers. The next year Mr. Feery spread a rumour that she had set fire to a house. The rumours of her sexual relationship continued and Bunyan was still having to deny them in later editions of his autobiography.Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), later editions, John Bunyan She wrote her account of this in about 1674. Beaumont married Thomas Warren of Cheshunt in 1702. He died in 1707 and the following year she married Samuel Storey who was a prosperous fishmonger, but she still owned half of her husband's land in Cheshunt. She died on 28 November 1720 and she was buried at Tilehouse Street Baptist chapel in Hitchin. This was her church and one that she had helped to pay for. Samuel Storey survived her. Legacy Vera Camden suggests that Beaumont's vigorous public defence of her character is all the more remarkable because the voices of female dissenters had become increasingly silenced after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660: > \\"What is remarkable about Agnes Beaumont is that she followed Bunyan‚Äôs > model: that she silenced her persecutors in a community courtroom rather > than lapsing into the exemplary silence of the woman, and, most importantly, > that she recorded her triumph for the edification of the saints.\\" Beaumont's autobiographical narrative was first published in print in An Abstract of the Gracious Dealings of God with Several Eminent Christians in their Conversions and Sufferings (1760) with additional text by the Reverend Samuel James of Hitchin.Agnes Beaumont, Orlando Project, Retrieved 10 May 2017 The volume proved popular, with ten editions published over the next eighty years. In 1812 a plaque was placed on Tile House Baptist church to record that she was a member of the church under the guidance of John Bunyan.Agnes Beaumont, Tile House Baptist Church, Retrieved 10 May 2017 In 1901 Beaumont was appearing in a book of girl heroines.Agnes Beaumont, True Stories of Girl Heroines, 1901 The nineteen-page source manuscript of Beaumont's autobiography, \\"The Narrative of the Persecution of Agnes Beaumont\\", was purchased by the British Museum in the 1870s, and is now preserved in the British Library References Category:1650s births Category:1720 deaths Category:People from Central Bedfordshire District Category:British women writers Category:British autobiographers Category:18th-century British writers Category:18th-century women writers Category:Women autobiographers ","title":"Agnes Beaumont"},{"id":"54014012","text":"Bee removal is the process of removing bees from a location. Professional services exist for this purpose. Since the honey bee is considered to be the most beneficial of all insect species, and bee colonies have potential economic value, professional bee removal often involves transferring them to a new location where they can be cared for and used for crop pollination and for production of honey and beeswax. As such, bee removal has characteristics both of pest control and of beekeeping. Live bee removal or saving the bees can be accomplished by a local beekeeper who will then either keep the bees, sell them, or simply help whoever is requesting the bee removal to keep them in a hive box. However, not all beekeepers provide removal services.  Species and subspecies  Typically, the species of bee involved in removal is the western honey bee (Apis mellifera). However, the Africanized bee (hybridized with Apis mellifera scutellata) can also be removed safely and relocated and kept alive. Bee removal professionals should not claim to be able to differentiate between the two types; this can only be done by laboratory analysis.

Following Sune Lindqvist, he was a professor at Uppsala University from 1965 to 1984. Early life and education Almgren was the son of Oscar Almgren, Sweden's first professor of Scandinavian and Comparative Archaeology. Bertil Almgren was born when his father was in his 50s and going blind, and so as a child would read him scholarly texts out loud. He would also accompany his father to the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, taking notes of lectures and discussions. Educated in Uppsala, he graduated in 1936, and obtained his Ph.D. in 1955. Career In 1956 Almgren he became a lecturer in Uppsala, a position he kept until 1962. That year he became a university lecturer, and in 1965 he succeeded M√•rten Stenberger as a professor of Scandinavian and Comparative Archaeology. Almgren focused his research on the Northern Iron Age, but included in his studies the periods from the Stone Age to historical times. He traveled extensively for his research, including across Europe, to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Asia. In the 1930s he excavated with Axel W. Persson in Dendra, Greece, and twenty years later he excavated in Persia with Carl Nylander (sv) and Hans Henning von der Osten (de). One of Almgren's major works was Vikingen, later translated into English as \\"The Viking\\" as well as into Danish, Norwegian, German, French, Italian, Dutch, and perhaps other languages. The book was a collaboration between Almgren as researcher and an illustrator, and provided a popular account of the Vikings, and one of the most influential.

It is situated on a steep rock overlooking Mile≈°evka River, the Mile≈°eva monastery and the settlement underneath it.  History  The fortification was mentioned for the first time in documents that date to 1444, but it is widely thought that it was built during the reign of Stefan Vladislav in the first half of the 13th century. It was built as a defense to a nearby Mile≈°eva monastery, overlooking the so-called Bosnian road, connecting Prijepolje and Sjenica. It is again mentioned in 1448 and 1454 as town of vojvoda Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça of Duchy of Saint Sava, until it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1465. Based on its numerous mentions in Ottoman documents, it can be concluded that it was an important fortification in the area for the Ottomans, who kept a garrison stationed in the fortress for a long time. Since the 17th century, the settlement was known as Hisarjik. When the Ottoman occupation ended, the small village underneath kept the name of Hisard≈æik. The massive rock on which the fortress was raised is naturally protected from the eastern, northern, and western sides by steep and untraversable cliffs. The fortress consisted of a citadel on top that was reinforced by two square towers (towards east and west), connected by a wall. Around the citadel, the fortification spread towards the south, reinforced by a single square tower. Additionally, two towers were built as outposts safeguarding the Mile≈°eva monastery. The monastery itself is one of the most important Serbian sanctuaries and spiritual centers, and a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. Monastery and the Mile≈°evac fortification above Mile≈°evac was also recently declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. There are currently plans for its reconstruction and preservation.

He was a lecturer at Uppsala University, where he taught, among others, Birger Nerman and Sune Lindqvist. Early life and education Knut Stjerna was born on 14 March 1874 in Malm√∂, Sweden, to Johan Stjerna and Matilda Johanna Gr√∂nlund. He studied at Lund University under Henrik Sch√ºck, focusing on the history of art and literature, and in 1898 published his first major independent work, Erik den helige: en sagohistorisk studie (\\"Erik the Holy: a sago-historical study\\"). The death of his father forced Stjerna to find employment at the newspaper Sydsvenskan to support his family, while continuing his studies at the university. He switched however to studying archaeology, in part because of the resistance he was met with for his \\"hypercritical\\" method of analysing legendary stories. In 1905, he obtained his Ph.D. Career Stjerna began teaching at Uppsala University in 1906, sharing responsibilities with Oscar Almgren, and took on a full-time position as lecturer in Scandinavian and Comparative Archaeology in 1907. That same year he undertook a major archaeological excavation in Uppsala with his students, after construction in the city uncovered the remains of medieval buildings. Stjerna's students at the university included Sune Lindqvist and Birger Nerman. Between 1903 and 1908 Stjerna published a number of articles about the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. In 1912 they were translated into English by John Richard Clark Hall, who was also responsible for several early translations of the poem. Stjerna's articles were credited with \\"providing a most welcome addition to the critical apparatus of the poem\\", by supplementing the meagre historical record with observations gleaned from archaeological research. Personal life By 1908 Stjerna's health was deteriorating, and in December he was admitted to the hospital with heart arrhythmia. He was discharged in March and resumed teaching, but died in November at the age of 35. Publications Stjerna published at least 23 works, several posthumous, between 1898 and 1911.

It is widespread and common from the Darling Downs in Queensland to Tasmania, usually growing with grasses.Labelled image of P. cycnocephalaWhole plant of P. cycnocephala Description Pterostylis cycnocephala, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between six and twelve dark green leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. Up to 24 shiny green flowers long and about wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. Three to six stem leaves are wrapped around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal is blunt and curved downwards with the sides turned down. The lateral sepals turn downwards, about long and wide, dished and joined for most of their length. The labellum is rectangular in shape, about long and whitish-green with a dark green, beak-like appendage pointing forward at its base. Flowering occurs from August to December. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis cycnocephala was first formally described in 1936 by Robert FitzGerald and the description was published in Fitzgerald's book, Australian Orchids. The specific epithet (cycnocephala) is derived from the Ancient Greek words kyknos meaning \\"swan\\" and kephale meaning \\"head\\", referring to the labellum appendage having the shape of a swan's head and neck.

It was made in a series of scales, from a small plaster maquette, through a half-size working model made in plaster and cast in bronze (LH 415), to a full-size version carved in Roman travertine marble in 1957‚Äì1958 (LH 416). The final work was installed in 1958 at the World Heritage Centre, the headquarters of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) at the Place de Fontenoy in Paris. This was Moore's last major public commission in which he created a new work for a specific site; he afterwards generally worked from an existing sketch or model. Background Moore was commissioned in 1955 to create a sculpture for the piazza in front of UNESCO's new headquarters in Paris, designed by the architect Marcel Breuer. Early ideas included groups of standing or seated figures, such as Draped Reclining Woman 1957‚Äì58 and Draped Seated Woman 1957‚Äì58, but he settled on a single and more abstract reclining figure for the UNESCO commission. Some of his early drawings are held by the British Museum. Description Moore took several maquettes to Paris in February 1957 for UNESCO representatives to select the best one. The selected sculpture depicts the abstracted form of a reclining female human figure, with recognisable arms, torso, and legs, and a disproportionately small head, with hollows representing eyes. Parallels can be drawn with his early stone Reclining Figure 1929 and his elmwood Reclining Figure 1935‚Äì6. Moore made the suggestion that the final work should be carved in white stone, to contrast with the dark windows of the building behind, rather than casting it in bronze as originally intended. Working model Bronze working model in Zurich in 2010 Moore completed a half-size working plaster model in August 1957, which measures . This model was made by applying layers of plaster to an armature, the surface of which was then worked with chisels and other tools. The plaster working model is held by the Art Gallery of Ontario. The working model (LH 415) was cast in bronze in edition of 7 (5 plus and artists copy, plus one extra cast made for the Tate Gallery), in 1959‚Äì1961: three at the Corinthian Art Bronze Foundry in London, two at in Paris, and two at the Hermann Noack foundry in Berlin. One example of the bronze is held by the Tate Gallery (cast 2/5). Other examples are held in the collections of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, the Chicago Art Institute, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (cast 4/5), and the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich (cast 5/5). Full-size sculpture The completed plaster working model was sent to the Soci√©t√© S. Henraux quarry at , near Seravezza and close to Carrara in northern Italy, in September 1957, where it was copied as a full- size version using four large blocks of Roman travertine marble. Moore visited frequently to check on how the work was progressing, and to finish parts roughed out by the Italian workmen. He took his wife Irina and daughter Mary on one trip, and instituted a tradition of taking regular summer holidays in the area, later buying his own cottage. The piece being moved, in 1963, to allow for building work The final sculpture (LH 416) was finished in mid-1958, over long and high, and weighing 38 tons, making it one of Moore's largest sculptures. It was installed near the new Y-shaped UNESCO building at the Place de Fontenoy in Paris in October 1958, and it was in place when the building was inaugurated the following month. The sculpture was moved in 1963, when UNESCO extended its offices, and it is now sited near Building IV.

The Springfield models 1865 and 1873 were best known for first employing this type of action.  Specifications  Drawing from Erskine S. Allin's patent for the Model 1865's trapdoor mechanism. The trapdoor mechanism employed a hinged breechblock that rotated up and forward, resembling the movement of a trapdoor, to open the breech of the rifle and permit insertion of a cartridge. The hinged breechblock caused these rifles to be named \\"Trapdoor Springfields\\". The conversion from musket to breechloader was done by milling open the barrel's breech section and inserting a hinged trapdoor fastened to the top of the barrel. A thumb-operated cam latch at the rear of the breechblock held it shut when in closed position. The rack-type system extractor was withdrawn automatically as the breechblock was opened and snapped back at the end of its stroke. The firing pin was housed within the breechblock. The hammer nose was flattened to accommodate the firing pin. Approximately 5,000 Civil War Model 1861 rifled muskets were converted at the Springfield Armory in 1866. It soon became apparent that many of the small working parts in the breech system were not going to have a long service life, and the action was too complicated for normal service use. Therefore, before the Model 1865 production order was completed, a less complex rifle was already being tested. This caused the Model 1865 to be called the \\"First Allin\\", and the following revised model, the Springfield Model 1866, to be called the \\"Second Allin\\". The Springfield model 1865 fired a rimfire .58-60-500 cartridge (.58 inch bullet, of black powder), the caliber matching that of the Civil War Mini√© ball, which was originally used in these rifles. The Model 1865 quickly became obsolete, and most of them were sold in the 1870s to several American arms dealers. At the time, there was a large demand in the US for shorter cadet-style rifles. To satisfy this need, these dealers cut the barrels and stocks to make short rifles with 33-inch and 36-inch barrel lengths. Likewise, the stock wrists were often thinned for cadet use.  Selection process  Springfield model 1866, trapdoor breech closed In 1872‚Äì1873 a military board, headed by Brigadier-General Alfred H. Terry, conducted an examination and trial of 99 rifles from several domestic and foreign manufacturers, including those from Springfield, Sharps, Peabody, Whitney, Spencer, Remington, and Winchester pursuant to the selection of a breech-loading system for rifles and carbines for the U.S. Military. The trials included tests for: accuracy, dependability, rate of fire, and ability to withstand adverse conditions. Both single-shot and magazine-equipped systems were considered, but, at the time, the single- shot was deemed to be more reliable. Firing tests were held at the Springfield Armory and Governor's Island where the average rate of fire for the Springfield was 8 rounds per minute for new recruits and 15 rounds per minute for experienced soldiers. The board recommended \\"No. 99 Springfield\\" which became the model 1873. After considerable testing, the prototype developed by Erskine S. Allin of the government-operated Springfield Armory was chosen for its simplicity and the fact that it could be produced by the modification of existing Springfield Model 1863 muskets. These modifications cost about $5 per rifle, which was a significant savings at a time when new rifles cost about $20 each. Patent No. 49,959 was issued to Erskine S. Allin on September 19, 1865, describing the design.  In fiction  The Springfield rifles with this modification. ¬®The Gun That Made One Man The Equal Of Five¬®, come out in the epilogue of the action in the film Springfield Rifle (used to stop the thieves stealing horses for the Confederates).

(From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for the mandates to be assigned out of numerical order.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

Overview  This national movement was a part of a larger range of youth programs, clubs and organizations which were created in 1990. The initial movement's motto was \\"For the glory of the Fatherland!\\". Modern YAM was formally established by presidential decree issued on October 29, 2015 by President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the behest of Minister of Defense General of the Army Sergey Shoygu. The Young Army Movement's aims are to improve the state policy in the field of education of the younger generation, create favorable environment for the harmonious development of the personality of children and young people, the formation of moral values and guidelines, as well as education in military and patriotic themes. Thus, the Young Army Cadets (–Æ–Ω–∞—Ä–º–µ–µ—Ü),–ü–µ—Ä–µ—á–µ–Ω—å –Ω–∞–∏–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –∑–∞—Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –°–ú–ò, –Æ–Ω–∞—Ä–º–µ–µ—Ü–£ \\"–Æ–Ω–∞—Ä–º–∏–∏\\" –ø–æ—è–≤—è—Ç—Å—è —Å–≤–æ–∏ –ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è as they are called, are from a wide number of youth groups and the Cadet Corps and Schools all over the country, the latter preparing youth for service within the Armed Forces. The YAM thus forms the military division of the wider Russian Youth and Students Movement, formed in 2015 under the Federal Service of Supervision of Education and Science, Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. = Uniform and traditions = Young Army Cadets are distinguished by their red berets.

The book was published in October 2016, several months before the debut of a new season of the series in May 2017. A follow-up book, Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier, also written by Frost, was released after the new season aired. The audiobook release features four original cast members from the original and sequel television series, Kyle MacLachlan, Russ Tamblyn, Michael Horse, and David Patrick Kelly, joined by original cast member Chris Mulkey and cocreator Mark Frost, and introduces 2017 season actors Amy Shiels, Robert Knepper, and James Morrison. Summary The book takes the form of a dossier of documents, letters, clippings and notes compiled by an unnamed individual referred to as The Archivist. The dossier was recovered in a steel lockbox at an undisclosed crime scene, and has been assigned by Federal Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director Gordon Cole to an FBI analyst with the initials \\"TP\\" for review and investigation. The documents are presented in a roughly chronological order, beginning with the exploration of the area by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, correspondence with President Thomas Jefferson, and Meriwether Lewis's mysterious death in 1809. The next section concerns the flight of the Nez Perce people from the area, with their leader Chief Joseph. Both Lewis and Joseph are mentioned to have experienced \\"vision quests\\" in the area where Twin Peaks would be founded. The town of Twin Peaks is founded when two families, the Packards and the Martells, form two rival sawmills on either side of the river. In 1927, boy scout Andrew Packard and scoutmaster Dwayne Milford see a giant figure in the woods during a camping trip. Milford confides to Packard that his brother, Douglas Milford, also reported seeing a similar figure. Douglas Milford‚Äîa minor character in the television series‚Äîsubsequently becomes one of the key figures in the book. His involvement with the Roswell UFO incident while with the U.S. Army Air Forces sees him assigned to investigate UFO sightings and abduction claims for Project Sign, Project Grudge and Project Blue Book, and to establish Listening Post Alpha, a SETI facility near Twin Peaks. In 1940, three children including Maggie Coulson (the Log Lady), Carl Rodd (the trailer park owner from Fire Walk with Me) and Alan Traherne, go missing in the woods, re-appearing with strange triangular markings on their bodies, and no memory of that day. The last section covers the events of the television series, including the murder of Laura Palmer. The backstories of several other characters including Josie Packard, Lawrence Jacoby, Ed and Nadine Hurley, and Norma and Hank Jennings are revealed in extracts from a book on notable local families by Dr. Lawrence Jacoby's brother Robert. The Archivist is revealed to be Major Garland Briggs, whose final entry in the dossier notes that \\"something's wrong\\" with Dale Cooper and ends with the word \\"*M*A*Y*D*A*Y*\\". The FBI analyst notes that Briggs subsequently disappeared, and Cooper's whereabouts are also unknown, with files on them at the USAF and FBI classified well above top secret. She signs off her investigation notes as Special Agent Tamara Preston. Reception Twin Peaks co-creator, writer and director David Lynch, when asked what he thought of the book, stated that he hadn't read it and that it was \\"his [Frost's] history of Twin Peaks\\". Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"More than 25 years after Laura Palmer was found wrapped in plastic, Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost returns to the Pacific Northwest with a new novel structured as a secret dossier. Assembled by a mysterious ‚Äúarchivist‚Äù and annotated by an FBI agent known only as TP, this enigmatic collection includes undiscovered Lewis and Clark diary entries, UFO sightings, and personal journals of Twin Peaks residents. Plus, Frost (finally!) tackles unanswered questions from the show‚Äôs finale\\". Eric Diaz of Nerdist commented \\"If you love Twin Peaks, there is no way I can‚Äôt recommend this book to you, although it really is made for the hardcore fan. And if you were looking for answers to mysteries laid out by the series finale, except for a few (Audrey lives!) you‚Äôll probably be disappointed. But hey, we have a whole new season of the show coming for all that. Taken together with the excellent audio version, this is a multimedia experience no Twin Peaks fan can afford to ignore\\".

It follows the romantic relationship between Eban (Brent Fellows), a 29-year-old gay man, and Charley (Gio Black Peter), a 14-year-old boy. Despite being about a very controversial topic (namely, age disparity in sexual relationships), the film addresses these issues in a low-key, relaxed manner. The film also addresses the consequences that Eban and Charley's relationship provokes with their parents. Its plot is based on an incident in which one of Bolton's friends was dumped by his older boyfriend, because their parents did not approve of their age disparity. Cast *Brent Fellows as Eban *Gio Black Peter as Charley *Nolan V. Chard as Charley's father *Ron Upton as Eban's father *Ellie Nicholson as Sunshine *Drew Zeller as Kevin *Pam Munter as Eban's mother Soundtrack The soundtrack to Eban and Charley was written and recorded by The Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt. The soundtrack album was released on January 22, 2002 on Merge Records, and was Merritt's first recording under his birth name. Merritt told Rolling Stone that he wanted to keep the music to the film open-ended, saying of the film, \\"If it was a love story it would be gushy strings, and if it were a horror show it would be horn blasts, so I decided to go a third way.\\" According to Metacritic, the film's soundtrack album has received generally favorable reviews from critics, with a score of 68 out of 100. Richie Unterberger gave it 3 out of 5 stars in a review he wrote for AllMusic and named it his fifth favorite album of 2001 in his list for Rolling Stone, writing \\"This soundtrack isn't a major effort from the Magnetic Fields man, but a modest triumph of subdued gloom all the same.\\" =Track listing= # Mother ‚Äì 0:38 # Cricket Problem ‚Äì 2:18 # Some Sunny Day ‚Äì 1:46 # O Tannenbaum ‚Äì 2:05 # Poppyland ‚Äì 3:19 # Drowned Sailors ‚Äì 1:37 # Maria Maria Maria ‚Äì 4:26 # Titles ‚Äì 1:28 # This Little Ukulele ‚Äì 1:21 # Tea Party ‚Äì 1:09 # Tiny Flying Player Pianos ‚Äì 1:14 # Mother Remembered ‚Äì 0:45 # Victorian Robots ‚Äì 2:06 # Water Torture ‚Äì 3:02 # Greensleeves ‚Äì 2:46 # Stage Rain ‚Äì 6:58 Release The film was first released at the Frameline Film Festival (then known as the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival) on June 12, 2000.

Reception The film received largely negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 33%, based on 9 critics' reviews, and on Metacritic, it has a score of 30 out of 100, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews,\\" based on 11 reviews. The New York Times Elvis Mitchell gave the film a 1 out of 5 rating, writing that it \\"might best be described as preaching to a sparse congregation, or else [Director James] Bolton is simply out to bore people into submission.\\" Ed Park of the Village Voice wrote that \\"Preachy and humorless, Eban and Charley shocks only by the quality of its numbing solipsism.\\" Maitland McDonagh, writing for TV Guide, gave the film one star out of 4, calling it \\"earnest but unenlightening\\" and writing that Bolton \\"undermines his own carefully balanced presentation of the situation by making 29-year-old Eban so creepy.\\" The Los Angeles Times Kevin Thomas was more favorable, writing in his review of the film that \\"Few people will be able to go along with Bolton's point of view regarding relationships between adults and underage youths, but there's no denying the writer-director, in his feature debut, has avoided sensationalism in telling this story.\\" Another favorable review was written in the Chicago Tribune by Patrick Z. McGavin, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. McGavin wrote that \\"The movie is never cheap or sensationalistic, and the performances are finely understated.

The Jewish family moved to Berlin, Germany, in 1929; when the Nazis came to power in 1933, they fled persecution to Milan in 1933. The family once again moved in 1939 when they left for New York City to flee from Italian Fascism.Margalit Fox, \\"John Gruen, Cultural Renaissance Man, Dies at 89\\", The New York Times, July 19, 2016 Grunberg chose the name \\"John Jonas Gruen\\" in an attempt to Americanize himself. He learned how to speak English from Hollywood films. Gruen graduated from the High School of Commerce in New York City. Initially he attended City College of New York. Then, in an effort to assimilate, he sought attendance at what he thought to be the most American school, the University of Iowa. Gruen majored in art history and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in the discipline. Career After graduation from college, Gruen moved back to New York City where he settled in Greenwich Village. He took jobs as a book buyer at Brentano's, a publicity director at Grove Press and a photographers' agent. Throughout his early years in New York, he aspired to be a composer and composed songs including settings of poetry by E. E. Cummings, Wallace Stevens and Rainer Maria Rilke. The songs were ultimately performed by Eleanor Steber and Patricia Neway. New Songs, a compilation of Gruen's work, was released in 1950 and was the first record issued by Elektra Records. He became friends with composer Virgil Thomson which inspired Gruen to contribute music reviews to the New York Herald Tribune, later becoming part of its staff in addition to acting as the paper's art critic. Using his shortened name John Gruen, he later went on to write for The New York Times, as well as being appointed as the first chief art critic of the magazine New York. Later in his career with the paper, he became a dance critic as well. Among Gruen's books are The Private World of Leonard Bernstein (1968), The Private World of Ballet (1975), Menotti: A Biography (1978), Erik Bruhn: Danseur Noble (1979), The World's Great Ballets (1981), People Who Dance: 22 Dancers Tell Their Own Stories (1988), The New Bohemia (1990), and Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography (1992) (translated into Italian). He published his autobiography, Callas Kissed Me...Lenny Too!: A Critic's Memoir, in 2008.\\"Review: Callas Kissed Me...Lenny Too!, The New Yorker, August 11, 2008 As a photographer, Gruen used his full name to distinguish himself from another New York photographer named John Gruen. Gruen captured images of the creative icons in his social and professional circles including Yoko Ono, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, Leonard Bernstein and Willem de Kooning. Many of those photographs were later acquired by the Whitney Museum of American Art and presented in a 2010 exhibition, \\"Facing the Artist: Portraits by John Jonas Gruen\\".\\"Facing the Artist: Portraits by John Jonas Gruen\\", Whitney Museum of American Art (2010) The Sixties: Young in the Hamptons (2006) and Two Men (2013) are a themed collections of his photographs. Personal life and death Gruen married abstract expressionist painter Jane Wilson whom he met while studying at the University of Iowa. Together they had one daughter, Julia Gruen, who became the executive director of the Keith Haring Foundation. Gruen and Wilson had homes on New York City's Upper West Side and in Water Mill, New York. Gruen died at the age of 89 from natural causes at his home in New York City in 2016.

Challis departed from Whiteman's employ in 1930 and did contract arrangements for many major swing era bands, including the Casa Loma Orchestra, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Lennie Hayton, Fletcher Henderson, Artie Shaw, and Frank Trumbauer. He also arranged for radio broadcasts. Later in his career he arranged for popular singers and ensembles. References *Dan Morgenstern, \\"Bill Challis\\".

The agency splits its inventory of state highway mileage into four categories: *The State Primary System includes Interstate Highways, Parkways, and other long-distance highways of statewide importance that connect the state's major cities, including much of the courses of Kentucky's U.S. Highways. *The State Secondary System includes highways of regional importance that connect the state's smaller urban centers, including those county seats not served by the state primary system. *The Rural Secondary System includes highways of local importance, such as farm-to-market roads and urban collectors. *Supplemental Roads are the set of highways not in the first three systems, including frontage roads, bypassed portions of other state highways, and rural roads that only serve their immediate area. The same-numbered highway can comprise sections of road under different categories. This list contains descriptions of Supplemental Roads and highways in the Rural Secondary System numbered higher than 3500 that do not have portions within the State Primary and State Secondary systems. The list includes highways up to the highest signed numbers in the 3600s and also the 6000 series of unsigned routes. KY 3500 Kentucky Route 3500 is a rural secondary highway in southern Allen County. The highway follows Old Gallatin Road from KY 1147 at Petroleum north to KY 100 in the city of Scottsville. KY 3500 begins at KY 1147 (Macedonia Road) just east of that highway's terminus at US 31E and US 231 in Petroleum. The highway heads north along Little Trammel Creek to its confluence with Trammel Creek, a tributary of Drakes Creek the route immediately crosses. KY 3500 passes through Rodemer and enters the city of Scottsville south of Ramble Creek. The highway reaches its northern terminus at KY 100, which heads north along Old Gallatin Road and west on Franklin Road. After US 31E's bypass of Scottsville was completed in 1989, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3500 as a supplemental road along old US 31E through a February 17, 1989, official order. The agency reclassified the highway as a rural secondary highway in a November 8, 2010, official order. KY 3520 Kentucky Route 3520 is a supplemental road in western McCracken County. The highway connects with US 60 at its ends west of West Future City and just west of the city of Paducah, and the highway runs concurrently with KY 305 next to Barkley Regional Airport. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3520 through a September 6, 2002, official order that also moved US 60 to its new course to the north. KY 3520 took over all of old US 60 except for two pieces at each end that were transferred to county maintenance. The new route also took over KY 1852 and included a pair of new connector roads between old US 60 and new US 60 at either end. KY 3520 begins at US 60 opposite Magruder Road. The highway heads south to Old US 60 No. 3 Road then turns east. The highway intersects KY 726 (Kelly Road) in West Future City and KY 996 (Metropolis Lake Road) in Future City. KY 3520 crosses the West Fork of Massac Creek and meets the southern end of KY 724 (Steele Road) as it passes along the northern edge of Barkley Regional Airport. The highway diverges from Old US 60, and the highway joins KY 305 in a north‚Äìsouth concurrency just south of the latter highway's junction with US 60. KY 3520 heads east from KY 305 opposite the airport's perimeter road. The highway intersects a Paducah & Louisville Railway line, crosses Black Branch of Massac Creek, and runs concurrently with KY 1565 past McCracken County High School. KY 3520 meets the southern end of KY 3529 (Maxon Road) immediately to the east of its bridge across Massac Creek. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at US 60 immediately after turning north from Old US 60 No. 1 Road. KY 3521 Kentucky Route 3521 is a rural secondary highway in southern Allen County. The highway begins at the Kentucky‚ÄìTennessee state line, from which the road continues south as Tennessee State Route 174. KY 3521 heads north as Old Andrew Jackson Highway along Little Trammel Creek through the village of Adolphus to KY 482, which takes over Old Andrew Jackson Highway to the north and is named Fleet Road heading west. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet added the highway to the rural secondary system through an October 13, 2005, official order. KY 3523 Kentucky Route 3523 is a supplemental road in southern Owen County. The highway follows Monterey Pike from US 127 east of Monterey north to KY 355 north of Monterey. KY 3523 heads west from US 127 into the city of Monterey. The highway crosses Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Kentucky River, and passes through the Monterey Historic District and to the east of Byrns Landing. KY 3523 curves north, exits the city, and reaches its terminus at KY 355 opposite the historic Monterey Grade School. After US 127 was relocated in southern Owen County in 2000, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet transferred several sections of Old US 127 in Owen County to county maintenance through an August 23, 2001, official order. In that same order, the agency retained the portion of Old US 127 through Monterey as a new supplemental road, KY 3523. KY 3529 Kentucky Route 3529 is a supplemental road in central McCracken County. The highway follows Maxon Road from KY 3520 north to US 60 just west of the city of Paducah.

It was designed by S. G. Simonov and P. A. Tkachev, and manufactured by TsNIITochMash. It uses a side by side barrel configuration, and it can reach a maximum rate of fire of 6000 rounds/min when fired in two round burst mode with a 0.01 second delay to increase ballistic performance, making it the fastest firing assault rifle known. Development The AO-63 assault rifle was used by the Spetsnaz during the Abakan trials in May/June 1986, in search of a more accurate alternative to replace the standard issue AK-74. It was described in the official report as being highly accurate as well as simple and reliable; despite its accuracy and performance, it was later dropped out of the competition for unknown reasons, with the AN-94 emerging victorious. Overview The AO-63 is a gas operated, 5.45x39mm calibre, twin barrel assault rifle derived from the Kalashnikov rifle. The weapon has side by side barrels with the right barrel predominant, twin rotating bolts/gas pistons and ejects from both sides. The trigger group has a 3 position selector on the right side of the receiver, the first is semi auto firing one barrel, the second in full auto firing both barrels with a 0.01 second delay, the third is unique as at first it fires a two-round 6000rpm burst then one barrel in 850rpm full auto. The magazine is unusual as it has the main double column holding 30 rounds with a single column holding 15 rounds.

History thumb Theatre Royal, Hindley Street, Adelaide c. 1886.Peel street would be just past the left of the photo. The department store Miller Anderson & Co. took over the properties to the east (right in the photo) towards Gresham Street Pit and gallery entrance via lane at left, dress circle by the wide entrance far right, stalls by the narrow door to its left. The first \\"Theatre Royal\\" in Adelaide was a small venue above the Adelaide Tavern in Franklin Street, managed by Mr. Bonnar and was opened in May 1838. The first production staged there was Mountaineers, or, Love and Madness (Colman). Bonnar was succeeded as manager by Sampson Marshall. This was eclipsed in 1841 by the opening of the Queen's Theatre on Gilles Arcade, off Currie Street, and the old theatre was remodelled as a Commercial Exchange. In December 1850 The Royal Victoria Theatre opened, also on Gilles Arcade, with Coppin and Lazar joint managers. In December 1865 a prospectus was issued in Adelaide for a Theatre Royal company to take over White's Assembly Rooms and the adjacent Clarence Hotel, alternatively to purchase a vacant site and erect a new building. By December 1867 plans had been prepared for a new structure to be added to the rear of Peter Cummings & Son's drapery store at 21 Hindley Street, Leonard Voullaire's at 23 (then was the financially troubled Paull & Meredith's wine bar 1868‚Äì1870), and Mrs Bament's at 27. Paull & Meredith had a wine bar. T. English was chosen as supervising architect and W. Lines the builder. The proprietors were John Temple Sagar, Samuel Lazar and J. M. Wendt. The foundation stone was laid by owner of the property H. R. Fuller on 8 January 1868, and the first performance held on 13 April 1868 (Easter Monday) was All that Glitters is not Gold by J. M. Morton. Edgar Chapman became owner of the property shortly after; it remained in his family for some time. The first lessee and director was George Coppin of Coppin, Harwood and Hennings, with stage manager J. R. Greville (1834‚Äì1894), a noted comedian. Samuel Lazar was lessee and manager from 1870, for a time in partnership with one Reuben Mills, suspended while his liquidity was being sorted out, then sole lessee from 1871. James Allison joined him as partner in 1873, became sole lessee around 1876. In October 1876 Edgar Chapman purchased the Theatre Royal, its hotel and the adjoining shops for ¬£11,000, and lost no time in appointing George R. Johnson architect for a complete rebuild of the theatre. This article includes considerable detail of the new design. The rebuilt house was opened on 25 March 1878 with an address written by Ebenezer Ward, followed by the opera Girofl√©-Girofla with Emily Soldene, Minna Fischer and Clara Vesey. These first few years were the heyday of musical theatre. These three articles give a useful roll-call of notable shows and performers to the outbreak of WWI. In 1883 external fire stairs were erected in response to demands from the City Council. In January 1885 Arthur Chapman, a brother of the owner, joined George Rignold and James Allison as co-lessees; Chapman being the local representative. In December Rignold and Allison withdrew from the partnership, leaving Chapman as sole trustee, as well as acting as managing the property for the ailing Edgar Chapman, and then for his estate. He continued in both roles April 1886, when Williamson, Garner, & Musgrove took over the lease, and on 1887 appointed Wybert Reeve as manager. Around 1889 Reeve became sole lessee of the theatre. On 19 October 1896 he hosted the first public demonstration in South Australia of moving pictures, the projector being a cin√©matographe Lumi√®re. Wybert Reeve retired from management in 1900, and sold the lease to F. H. Pollock, who managed the theatre capably until forced by illness to take on Herbert Percy Myers (1879‚Äì1927), his wife's nephew, as manager. Pollock died in November 1908, and his wife continued to run it in partnership with Myers. The theatre was further enlarged and updated in 1914. Myers purchased the lease in December 1921, and in 1920 purchased the property from the Chapman estate. He subsequently sold half to Sir George Tallis, who sold half of that to the Tait family business. Myers' half share was inherited by his widow, and in January 1954 Tallis sold his interest to the J. C. Williamson organization. The department store Miller Anderson & Co. took over the properties between the Theatre Royal and Gresham Street, and erected a five-storey building.

Among other work he oversaw the creation of a plaster cast of the ship impression, from which a fibreglass replica of the ship was formed. He later helped mould an impression of the Graveney boat, in addition to other excavation and restoration work. Van Geersdaele studied at Hammersmith Technical College from 1946 to 1949, after which he engaged in moulding and casting at the Victoria and Albert Museum until 1951. From 1954 to around 1976 he was a conservator at the British Museum, rising to the position of senior conservation officer in the British and Medieval department. Following that he became an assistant chief of archaeology in the conservation division of the National Historic Sites of Canada for Parks Canada, and then the deputy head of the conservation department at the National Maritime Museum in London. He retired in 1993, and during that year's Birthday Honours was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his services to museums.  Early life and education  Peter Charles van Geersdaele was born on 3 July 1933 in Fulham, South West London, to a family with roots in the Netherlands. He studied between 1946 and 1949 at Hammersmith Technical College, where he became a member of the cast department of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1949 to 1951. In the early 1950s van Geersdaele served in the Royal Air Force. While stationed at RAF Binbrook, in Lincolnshire, he played football for Grimsby Town F.C., managed by Bill Shankly. According to a later colleague, van Geersdaele \\"toyed with being a professional footballer\\" after his discharge, and had a trial with Queens Park Rangers F.C. Instead, in 1954 he joined the British Museum.  British Museum  From 1954 to 1976 van Geersdaele worked at the British Museum. He began in the moulders‚Äô shop, creating replicas of classical sculpture, and rose to become a senior conservation officer in the British and Medieval department. There he notably led the team tasked with making a mould, and later a fibreglass replica, of the Sutton Hoo ship, a process he repeated in October 1970 with the Graveney boat. Other work at the museum included the 1964 removal of a thirteenth- century tile kiln from Clarendon Palace, a project in which, as with the Sutton Hoo ship, he was assisted by Nigel Williams, and the 1973 restoration of fourteenth-century wallpaintings from St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster Palace. He also helped with excavations of the Longton Hall porcelain factory and the Broadstairs Anglo-Saxon cemetery. During his time at the museum he also studied part-time towards a conservation diploma at University College London's Institute of Archaeology, which helped equip him to publish several articles on his work. = Sutton Hoo ship-burial = The ship impression during the 1939 excavation During the 1967 re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, van Geersdaele undertook moulding an impression of the ship. Initially excavated in 1939, the Anglo-Saxon burial is widely identified with R√¶dwald of East Anglia. After the 1939 dig the ship impression was filled in with bracken, which had gradually decayed and mixed in with the sandy soil to preserve the traces of the ship. When the site was again excavated in 1965, the impression, which excavation leader Rupert Bruce-Mitford termed \\"the ghost of the ship\\", was shown to have largely survived the preceding 26 years with minimal damage. The need to excavate beneath the ship, and to remove the ship's rivets for study, necessitated the destruction of the impression; to mitigate the damage, it was decided to make a plaster cast first, and to use this to make a fibreglass replica. The making of the plaster cast took three weeks. Van Geersdaele led the operation, with help from Jack Langhorn, senior technician at the British Museum's plasterers' shop, A. Prescott, Nigel Williams, G. Adamsom, Y. Crossman, and G. Joysmith. Plaster of Paris was used for its fast setting time and cost efficiency, and five experiments were conducted to find an appropriate method. In the first experiment, using soil dumps from the excavation, plaster was applied directly to earth, but when removed pulled the earth away with it. Two attempts to chemically consolidate the surface were then unsuccessfully tried, before an attempt was made to lay polyethylene directly over the impression to act as a barrier. This produced too many wrinkles, and so in a final, successful, experiment, wet paper towels were instead used as barriers. The method was repeated across the entire ship. The ship was moulded in 85 sections, and weighed an estimated . Following the moulding of the ship impression, a fibreglass cast was made in 23 sections. The mould was first assembled upside down; the joins were then filled in with plaster, and a light coat was applied to the rest of the mould to remove any wrinkles caused by the paper towel barrier. The plaster was then sealed and coated with wax before casting. The casting process itself took three weeks, two sections being cast each day. The cast was removed and reassembled, supported on a wooden frame with eighty legs. = Graveney boat = Van Geersdaele was asked in 1970 to take an impression of a clinker-built wooden boat, when the widening of a watercourse near the village of Graveney in Kent unearthed the ninth century vessel. Its ribs were lifted so that a plaster mould of the hull could be taken, in a similar method to that employed on the Sutton Hoo ship; here however the ship was removed and conserved after the mould was taken, the mould serving to help with the ship's reassembly. Nineteen plaster sections were laid over three and a half days, and then lifted in less than an hour.  Later career  In 1976 van Geersdaele moved to Ottawa with his wife and younger daughter, where he took on the role of Assistant Chief of Conservation (Archaeology) for Parks Canada's National Historic Sites of Canada. Four years later the family moved back to England, and van Geersdaele became the National Maritime Museum's deputy head of conservation. Van Geersdale was responsible for the movement and installation of exhibits, and oversaw a major reorganisation of the storage of the reserve collections. He retired in 1993.  Personal life  Van Geersdaele married Maura Bradley in 1955, and had two daughters, Maxine and Sharon, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren. After returning to England in 1976, he lived in Woodbridge, Suffolk: \\"a stone's throw from the site of his triumph at Sutton Hoo\\", as a British Museum colleague termed it. During the 1993 Birthday Honours van Geersdaele was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his services to museums. In 2003 van Geersdaele was part of a group of pensioners who protested against an 18 percent raise in Council Tax by Suffolk County Council, and the following year was summoned to court for spreading out the tax increase across twelve monthly installments rather than the required ten. As late as 2006, van Geersdaele, as part of the Protest Against Council Tax Suffolk (PACTS) committee, continued protesting inefficiencies in the Council Tax collection system. Van Geersdaele died on 20 July 2018. He was remembered by a colleague, Andrew Oddy, as \\"a natural-born leader who was universally liked and who inspired those who worked with him to give of their best\\", and as among \\"the last of the team of conservators and specialist craftsmen who responded to a challenge that had left archaeologists daunted\\".

Its publication started at the end of 1930 (2473) and was in continuous operation as a daily newspaper in Thailand up into the 1950s. It was an early business venture of Lek Komet (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å ‡πÇ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏®). Lek was in his late thirties in 1930. His first success in business was as a compradore with the Burley Company. He subsequently started Haang Komet (‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÇ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏®) and then went on to his own branded line of cosmetics. He sold that business and used the capital to develop other ventures. Thai Mai was an early one of those ventures. He had a partner in the Thai Mai startup, one Ek Wisakul (‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏Å ‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏•), another successful compradore. History The first editor was Kularp Saipradit (‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏©‡∏ê‡πå), a man who would later achieve a great deal as a writer, editor and dissident. Thai Mai was Saipradit's second lead editor job, his magazine Suphap Burut (\\"The Gentlemen\\") having recently closed.He and his circle of associated writers all came over to the new paper. Editorial policy was moderately anti-monarchist, advocating the implementation of constitutional government. Between 1930 and the 1932 revolution, the paper was ordered closed or fined a number of times, all for material that was deemed offensive to the established order. Credit for the paper's ideology was generally attributed to the editorial progressiveness of Kularp and his associates, but at least one of the owners, Ek, shared the sentiment for constitutional government. It was also clearly a business venture, in addition to whatever political ambitions it may have had. The masthead motto was ‚ÄúStart Life Anew by Reading Thai Mai‚Äù. It published news and essays and worked to generate reader appeal. The owners and editors succeeded commercially, and within a year or two they had added two publications: a Sunday edition called Thai Mai Wan Atthit (‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏¢‡πå), and Suriya (‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡∏≤), both focusing more on entertainment than news and commentary. Suriya specialized in serialized novels and publishing some of the early work of Jacob (‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ö), another famous writer of the era. Within a couple of years of the paper‚Äôs founding, before the 1932 revolution, Luang Wichitwathakan (‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£) came on as a new shareholder. Kularp and his associates were forced out and new editorial leadership was installed. Kularp‚Äôs biographers suggest that these changes were done because of Wichit, because he wanted the paper to be supportive of the government. However, Wichit was a member of the group of men who perpetrated the change of government in 1932. He was particularly close to then Col. Pibul Songkraam, the eventual long term, multi-term leader to whom he would remain allied for the next twenty-five years. At this time, Wichit was on the cusp of being immensely influential in creating the mythology of Thai nationalism. He had no interest in protecting monarchical government. He might, however, have had his own ideas about editorial direction and clashed with Kularp. Or his coming into ownership might have signaled to Kularp that his future with the organization was not going to fulfill his ambitions. It may also have been that Wichit‚Äôs ownership was part of a staged strategy to have an editorial outlet at the ready when the coup occurred in June 1932. War time Thai Mai stayed quite close to the government in its editorial policy. Every edition had a text box just under the masthead with the words ‚ÄúObey/believe Pibul Songkhraam [and] the country will be safe.‚Äù The paper sometimes reported on radio broadcasts of government propaganda at length, repeating much of the content as if it were authoritative news. Reading back and forth between the few Thai Mai editions that have been saved on National Library microfilms and the samples of other papers preserved in the Kyoto University online archive, it seems that Thai Mai‚Äôs headlines and story selection as the war was winding down remained more Japan-centric, avoided the obvious fact that the allies were on the cusp of victory.

The film stars Chris Evans as an Israeli Mossad agent who runs a covert operation that helps Ethiopian- Jewish refugees escape to safe haven in Israel. Michael Kenneth Williams, Haley Bennett, Alessandro Nivola, Michiel Huisman, Chris Chalk, Greg Kinnear, and Ben Kingsley are in supporting roles. The film is loosely based on the events of Operation Moses and Operation Joshua in 1984-1985, in which the Mossad covertly evacuated Jewish Ethiopian refugees to Israel using a base at the once-abandoned holiday resort of Arous Village on the Red Sea coast of Sudan. The Red Sea Diving Resort premiered at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival on July 28, 2019, and was released on July 31, 2019, by Netflix. Critical reaction to the film was predominantly negative, while audiences were far more positive. Plot Kebede Bimro, an Ethiopian Jew, works with the Israeli Mossad agent Ari Levinson to evacuate Jewish-Ethiopian refugees to Israel. Ari realizes that his ability to operate in Ethiopia would be improved if he had a cover activity that would give him a reason for having a building and vehicles. He proposes to Israeli intelligence officer Ethan Levin a plan that would allow him to evacuate significantly more refugees: rent the Red Sea Diving Resort, an abandoned Sudanese coastal hotel, and run it as a front to facilitate moving refugees out of the country. The unorthodox plan is reluctantly approved, and Ari recruits his former Mossad colleagues Rachel Reiter, Jake Wolf, Max Rose, and Sammy Navon, to assist him. Shortly after the team's arrival in the Islamic country of Sudan, the brochures they had printed inspire actual tourists to begin arriving at the resort. Although hosting guests was not originally part of the plan, Levinson realizes the tourists will provide cover for the team's operations, so the team runs the resort as a legitimate business while simultaneously evacuating refugees to a waiting Israeli ship off the coast. The plan is initially successful, and multiple extraction operations are carried out, but the Sudanese Colonel Abdel Ahmed learns of Bimro after interrogating and then killing a group of refugees. Ahmed visits the resort to investigate but does not discover the refugee operation. One night, Ari and Sammy are arrested after an evacuation mission narrowly escapes from Sudanese soldiers. They are released and return to the resort to find Levin awaiting them; he tells the group the mission has been compromised and that it is canceled. Ahmed again visits the resort, and Rachel is forced to kill one of his men after the soldier discovers a group of refugees hiding there. To evacuate them, Ari decides to perform a final refugee extraction by cargo plane with assistance from Walton Bowen, a CIA officer. Ari and his team transport the refugees to an abandoned British airfield. The team and Bimro narrowly escape Ahmed and extract themselves and the refugees.

The actual abandoned resort, the Arous Holiday Village on the Red Sea, was located roughly 70 kilometers from Port Sudan and was managed by Mossad operatives until 1985. The existence of these operations was first revealed in Gad Shimron‚Äôs 1998 book Mossad Exodus: The Daring Undercover Rescue of the Lost Jewish Tribe, though the film is not associated with the book. In August 2015, Fox Searchlight purchased the rights for the film. Development on the film was first announced in March 2017, with Gideon Raff directing and writing the screenplay, and Chris Evans and Haley Bennett cast. In April, Michael K. Williams joined the project. In May, Greg Kinnear, Alessandro Nivola, and Ben Kingsley were added to the cast, with a filming start date of June 22, 2017, established. Chris Chalk was cast on June 15. Shooting took place in South Africa and Namibia. Release In February 2019, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film. It had its world premiere at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival on July 28, 2019. It was released on July 31, 2019. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 40 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.68/10. However the public reviews gave it 80%. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Red Sea Diving Resort makes uninspired use of actual events, using thinly written characters to tell a story derailed by its own good intentions.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 29 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", while users gave it 6.5/10.

History =Spanish colonization= Spanish merchants began arriving to present day Western Sahara as early as the late 1400s.Encyclopedia Britannica: Western Sahara During the Scramble for Africa Spain began occupying land in Western Sahara which was then granted to Spain by the Berlin Conference which allowed Spain to occupy territory from Ras Nouadhibou (Cape Blanc) to Cape Bojador. In 1884, Emilio Bonelli, head of the Spanish Society of Africanists and Colonists (Sociedad Espa√±ola de Africanistas y Colonistas) traveled to R√≠o de Oro and signed treaties with the coastal peoples. Since then, Spain claimed the coastal portions of the territory and tried to claim more inland territory, however, they were hindered by French claims in Mauritania and by partisan belonging to Ma al-'Aynayn. By 1934, Spain occupied the Western Sahara towns of Smara and La G√ºera and occupied the two territories of R√≠o de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra. =Spanish withdrawal= In 1956, Morocco obtained independence from France and immediately laid claim to the territories of R√≠o de Oro and Saguia el- Hamra in 1957. After Morocco claimed the land, Spanish troops succeeded in repelling Moroccan military incursions into the territories. In 1958, Spain united the territories of R√≠o de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra into one and named it \\"Spanish Sahara\\". For several decades, Spain's control of the territory became very difficult, especially with Mauritania obtaining its independence in 1960 and claiming Spanish Sahara (Western Sahara) for itself and the fact that phosphate deposits were discovered within the territory. In 1970, a political group was established, calling itself the Polisario Front and made up of mainly native Sahrawi people. In 1974, Spain agreed to hold a referendum on self-determination for Spanish Sahara as originally mandated by the United Nations in 1966, however, the United Nations asked Spain to defer to the International Court of Justice to see if Morocco and Mauritania had claim to the land. In 1974, ‚ÄúThe Court's conclusion was that the materials and information presented to materials and information presented to it did not establish any tie of territorial it did not establish any tie of territorial sovereignty between the territory of sovereignty between the territory of Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco or the Mauritanian entity.\\"ICJ: Summary of the Summary of the Advisory Opinion of 16 October 1975 In 1975, Spain agreed to partition part of the territory to Morocco and to Mauritania after it was agreed at the Madrid Accords, however, international protest erupted as it went against the right for Self- determination and the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514 (Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples). In November 1975, over 350,000 Moroccans and 20,000 Moroccan troops held the \\"Green March\\" into Spanish Sahara to force Spain to hand over the disputed territory. After Spanish withdrawal from Western Sahara, the Western Sahara War began. In 1976 the Polisario Front declared a government-in-exile and named their country the \\"Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\\" (SADR).BBC: Western Sahara profile =Post withdrawal= Since 1975, official governmental relations between Spain and the exiled-government in Algeria of the Polisario Front are nearly non-existent. Since 1997, there have been several United Nations resolutions concerning Western Sahara. In April 1991, the United Nations adopted United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). In 2003, Spain, as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council voted in favor for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1463 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1495 to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). For several years, Secretary General of the Polisario Front and President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Mohamed Abdelaziz, paid numerous visits to Spain advocating for SADR independence.

Produced by Abhishek Nama, it features Nikhil Siddharth and Ritu Varma in the lead roles, with dialogues by Krishna Chaitanya, Arjun-Carthyk, music composed by Sunny M.R., Cinematography by Divakar Mani, and editing by S. R. Shekar. The movie was released on 19 May 2017. This movie received good reviews from both audiences and critics and was a box office hit and back to back hit from Nikhil. Plot A family of 4 travelling in a car were hit by a police jeep and left to die. Keshava wakes up in the hospital to learn that his parents were killed and his younger sister lost her legs. The story shifts to present with Keshava (Nikhil Siddharth), now a youngster, walking in a desolate forest road and asks a biker for lift. After a while, the biker halts to attend the nature call and Keshava stabs him to death. Keshava narrates in a voice-over that he is a law student with a rare heart condition ‚Äì Dextrocardia, which prevents him from activities resulting in faster heart beat. So, he has to do everything leisurely even if it's a murder. A fisherman witness the dead body of the biker hanging from a tree and informs the police. The police identify the victim as a police officer. Satyabhama (Ritu Varma) joins the college and attends the same class as Keshava. Satyabhama recognizes Keshava as her childhood friend, but he dismisses it and keeps avoiding her. As the police fail to find any clues, police commissioner appoints a special officer, Sharmila Mishra (Isha Koppikar), to investigate the case. Keshava is sipping tea in front of a police station and identifies another police officer as someone who tried to kill him and his sister in hospital but he managed to escape. He follows the police officer on his bike and kills him in a desolate place. Sharmila finds the dead body hanging from a construction crane. She connects the dots and figures out that these Two murders were done by same person and interprets that the killer is trying to convey something. After investigation, she concludes that the killer is left-handed. Satyabhama notices Keshava writing with his left hand and remembers him doing the same in their childhood. She follows him to library and notices him reading about the murders. She manages to get the attendance register and finds out that Keshava was absent during both days of murders. She goes to his home and makes him admit that he is her childhood friend. Keshava, Satyabhama and his friends go to Annavaram to volunteer in a temple program. Keshava comes across another police officer (Raja Ravindra) and recognizes him to be the one who had left his family to die after the accident. He kills the officer after a fight but he is noticed by watchmen while returning and one of them hits him with a stone on the back of his head. After returning to the accommodation, his friends confront him to confess his activities. He narrates his past which lead him to kill some people. They decide to help him. He gets treatment for his head injury from a local doctor who informs police after watching the News about the murder and details of suspect in TV. The next day while travelling in a bus, Sharmila catches him and takes him to Visakhapatnam for interrogation. Keshava denies all charges on him and his friends destroy any evidence of his involvement. Meanwhile, a retired Police Officer Krishna Murthy (Rao Ramesh) is reportedly attacked by a person matching the description of the murderer. Keshava is eventually released and meets the officer. He narrates that he is among the people responsible for the death of his parents. While returning from election duty, Nakul (Ajay) and others were fully drunk and Nakul was driving the jeep and caused accident. Although he requested them to save the victims, Nakul ignored. Keshava later admits to Sharmila that he is the murderer and narrates that he is not avenging the accident but murder. He says that his parents were alive after the accident and the police returned and drove over them to make sure that there won't be complaint against them. Keshava finds another officer Bheemeshwar (Brahmaji), and kills him in broad daylight. Nakul tries to locate Keshava but fails. Sharmila gets suspicious about Krishna Murthy and he kidnaps her. Keshava is kidnapped by Nakul's henchmen but he manages to escape from them and kills Nakul with the help of one of his henchmen. Krishna Murthy and Sharmila have a heated argument and he admits that he drove the jeep at the time of accident and is the prime culprit. He only rescued Keshava from police so that Keshava kills Nakul and he inherits binami properties of Nakul. Keshava is already on the spot when Krishna Murthy was narrating real events to Sharmila. In a subsequent chase, Krishna Murthy meets with an accident. Keshava warns him not to drink and drive at least in his next life and burns the car. Sharmila closes the case as an accident. Keshava starts a new life with his sister and Satyabhama.

Her rescue and ransom involved many of the major power players that defined relations in this period between the Florida tribes and the nations of Britain, Spain, and the United States. Colonial Saint Augustine Bonelly was born in Saint Augustine, Florida, in 1786 during the Second Spanish Period. She was the daughter of Maria Moll and Josef Bonelly, who were Mediterraneans who immigrated to America with the Andrew Turnbull expedition at New Smyrna, Florida, in 1768. Turnbull's colony was abandoned after nine years of abusive conditions and the surviving colonists walked seventy miles to Saint Augustine seeking release from their indenture. They were welcomed to the city by Governor Patrick Tonyn, who was a rival of Turnbull, and most settled into the Minorcan Quarter where some families thrived for generations. After the American Revolution, the British ceded the colony to Spain by the Treaty of Paris. British citizens were forced to sell or leave their homes in Saint Augustine, but the Minorcans‚Äîwho spoke a form of Spanish, practiced Catholicism, and had suffered abuse by British overseers‚Äîhad little difficulty publicly swearing allegiance to the Spanish crown. Whereas the British sought security through colonization and expansion, the Spanish viewed Saint Augustine as a military outpost. The population of the colony dropped from 17,000 to 3000 after the British evacuation and the Minorcans became the majority civilian population. Capture and Ransom In 1796, Josef Bonelly was granted 600 acres by Spanish colonial Governor Enrique White near Matanzas Inlet, where he engaged in farming near the site of the original Turnbull colony. In January 1802, Antonia Paula Bonelly was fifteen years old and living on her father's plantation at Matanzas with her parents and five siblings: her adult brother Tomas (25), and four young children between 1 and 14 years of age. At around three o'clock in the afternoon of January 21, a war party of nine Miccosukee raiders attacked.Deposition of Antonia Leonardy, 01-OCT-1835. American State Papers, Class V, Military Affairs Vol VI, p 500 Josef Bonelly was away from the property, and his son Tomas was murdered‚Äîby one account slain in the fields where he was working, by another, tied with cords, scalped, and burned at his father's house at the wharf. Testifying in 1835, an old Saint Augustine citizen recalled seeing the dead body of Tomas Bonelly laid in the marketplace after being brought to town in a boat.Deposition of Philip Solano, 07-OCT-1835. American State Papers, Class V, Military Affairs Vol VI, p 500 The Miccosukee spared the mother and young children and claimed them as hostages. The party set out immediately with all the plunder that they and the prisoners could carry, and travelled by a circuitous route for the interior of the country. After twenty-four days of travel, they reached their eventual destination: the town of Miccosukee, located along the boundary of Spanish East and West Florida (about twenty miles northeast of present-day Tallahassee). Miccosukee was advantageously isolated. The Spanish considered this area west of the Suwannee River under West Florida jurisdiction, managed at Pensacola, but it was a day's journey from the Spanish outpost at Saint Marks and considerable distance still from Apalachicola. Bonelly later testified that the Chief was named Ken-ha- jah,Deposition of Antonia Leonardy, 01-OCT-1835. American State Papers, Class V, Military Affairs Vol VI, p 500 but he was almost certainly Kinache, who was known by many names including Kinhega, Kinheja, and Kinhija. Born in 1750, Kinache was prominent among the Seminoles along the mouth of the Apalachicola River. He had allied with Britain during the Revolution and fought against the Spanish. Following Britain's defeat, Kinache moved to the village on the west side of Lake Miccosukee. It took seven months before a trader trusted by the natives, named Jack Forrester, was sent to rescue the family. Forrester worked for the Scottish firm Panton, Leslie & Company, founded in 1783 for the purpose of trading with the tribes in Florida. Having established themselves in Florida and the Bahamas, Panton was able to continue operating in Florida after its return to Spanish rule because there were no Spanish traders established in trade with the natives. The partners used their influence with the tribes to both advance Spanish territorial claims against the United States, and to encourage the natives to resist new white settlements and US attempts to acquire land. Acting as emissary in the summer of 1802, Forrester bought the freedom of the mother, Maria Bonelly, and her three youngest children for $300 ransom. But the sum was deemed insufficient for the teenagers, Antonia Paula and Josef, and they remained. Though her condition was undocumented, the ordeal may have shortened the life of eleven year-old Catherine Bonelly, who was released but died within the year. In the weeks that followed Forrester's mission, fourteen year-old Josef escaped the Miccosukee and hid in the surrounding woods and swamps. He made it to Saint Marks on the Gulf of Mexico where military commanders had him sent to Havana. There, he spotted a family friend and sea captain named Esteban Ben√©t who was able to transport him home to Saint Augustine. In 1803, the elder Josef Bonelly sold his Matanzas holdings and gathered the remaining ransom. Twenty- two months after the original attack, he sent his son-in-law Tomas Pacetty with $200 to gain freedom for Antonia Paula. Pacetty traveled with King Payne, a native interpreter, and an African slave. The venture was successful, and Pacetty returned the now seventeen year-old to her family, several months pregnant. Bonelly had been held by the Miccosukee medicine man as a mate, and weeks after returning to Saint Augustine, she gave birth to a girl that was baptized Maria Antonia Demecia Bonelly. The girl lived nine or ten years. She died around the same year as Antonia Paula's father, who passed in 1811 at the age of 54. Josef Bonelly was financially ruined by the raid on his property, and there is no evidence of how he supported himself after selling his farm. Antonia Paula Bonelly married Bartolome Leonardy in 1808‚Äîwhile her Miccosukee daughter was still living‚Äîand had a large family, about half of whom would become early settlers of Tampa. Leonardy was the son of one of the most prominent Minorcan businessmen in colonial Saint Augustine, Don Roque Leonardy. Bonelly lived through the Civil War and had grandchildren and great grandchildren who fought for the Confederacy. She died in 1870 when she was 84 years old, and last lived at the house of her daughter Laurenna Leonardy at 56 Marine Street (the Gonz√°lez-Jones House). Political Context The attack on the Bonelly plantation was not random, and it had political roots in the decades-long struggle between native, Spanish, British, and American interests in Florida. King Payne told Jack Forrester that a small party of natives had set out with the intention of plundering the inhabitants of the coast. Forrester was concerned that the Spanish defenses along the Saint Johns were relaxed and that even small groups of raiders‚Äîlike the nine-man Miccosukee war party‚Äîcould not be repelled. Planters, like Bonelly, were increasingly anxious about their exposed position. Forrester and Payne's direct involvement in the Bonelly negotiations show that larger forces were at play in this event than simply the safety of a fifteen-year-old girl. Panton had a robust commercial enterprise in Florida that had withstood the political change of authority from Britain to Spain, but was now at risk because of a lack of security. The balance of allegiances was complicated for the tribes. While William Augustus Bowles appealed to natives with a call for nationalism, Forrester was the key access point to essential European commodities: in particular, weapons and rum. Panton supported Indian resistance against Spanish incursions and the imminent invasion of the United States, but not if that resistance included the disruption of Panton's monopoly by insurgents like Bowles.

Since then to present times, the Cuban people have highly enjoyed opera, and many Cuban composers have cultivated the operatic genre, sometimes with great success at an international level. 19th century The first documented operatic event in Havana took place in 1776. That presentation was mentioned in a note published in the newspaper Diario de La Habana on December 19, 1815: \\"‚Ä¶Today, Wednesday 19th of the current, if the weather allows, the new tragic opera of merit in three acts that contains 17 pieces of music, titled Dido Abandoned will be performed [‚Ä¶] This is one of the premiere dramas from the French theater. In Italy, the one composed by renowned Metastasio deserved a singular applause, and was sung in this city on October 12, 1776.\\"Gonz√°lez, Jorge Antonio: La composici√≥n oper√≠stica en Cuba. Editorial Letras Cubanas, La Habana, Cuba, 1986. On August 9, 1807 another note was published in a Havanese newspaper that announced: \\"There is a Lyric-heroic drama in this printing shop titled America and Apolo which will be presented at this theater‚Ä¶\\", and on the following September 8 the premiere of the announced piece took place at the former Coliseo Theater, that had already changed its name to Principal. That was the first lyric piece composed in Cuba that we have information about, and its composer was Manuel de Sequeyra y Arango, Captain of the Havana Infantry Regiment. The piece was really a \\"dramatic action\\" in the Metastasian style; a brief composition in which the choir participated occasionally.Gonz√°lez, p. 10 From 1810 to 1832 a lyric company performed several operas in Havana, among which were those called Las cuatro columnas del trono espa√±ol and El major d√≠a de La Habana,Gonz√°lez, p. 15 and in 1811 another company arrived to that city that included the soprano Mariana Galino, contralto Isalbel Gamborino, tenor Juan Palau and the Italian composer Stefano Cristiani. Cristiani and other Spanish composers, such as Manuel Antonio Cocco and Jos√© Serrano, were very active, creating, producing and conducting operas in Havana, between 1815 and 1832.Gonz√°lez, p. 9-35 Crist√≥bal Mart√≠nez Corr√©s was the first Cuban opera composer, but his Works, such as El diablo contrabandista and Don papanero were never premiered and haven't been preserved until the present time. Born in Havana, in 1822, composer and pianist Mart√≠nez Corr√©s established his residence together with his family in France when he was just nine years old; and at a later tame they went to Italy. Due to his premature death, a third opera named Safo, never surpassed an early creative stage. Mart√≠nez Corr√©s passed away in Genoa, in 1842.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 134. Among the operatic composers that worked in Cuba during the first half of the 19th century we can mention the Spanish Jos√© Mar√≠a Trespuentes and Narciso T√©llez, as well as the Italian Enea Elia. We should also mention two other renowned Italian composers, which arrived at a very young age to Havana to work as instrumental performers during the season of 1846-1847, and stayed in Cuba several years. One of them, Giovanni Battista Bottesini, composed his first opera, named Col√≥n in Cuba, in the Island; and the other composer, Luigi Arditi, also premiered his opera Gulnara in Cuba, only four days after Bottesini's.Gonz√°lez, p. 47-66 Luigi Arditi The North-American pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk lived in Cuba from 1845 to 1862, and there he developed an important work as performer, conductor and composer. Gottschalk utilized Afro-Cuban elements of style in complex classical forms, such as a Caprice di Bravura based on the Cocoy√© theme, as well as an opera titled \\"Fiesta campestre Cubana (Cuban countryside feast).Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Armando: Los sonidos de la m√∫sica Cubana. Evoluci√≥n de los formatos instrumentales en Cuba, 2015, p. 22 About that opera Gottschalk wrote in his memoires: \\"Two months later (based on an offer made by the General-in Chief to put at my disposal all the military bands) I had, as I tell you, the idea to offer a great festival, and I came to an arrangement with the Italian Opera conductor, then in possession of the Great Tac√≥n Theater. A contract in which he committed to provide the main soloists, all the choirs, and the entire orchestra, with the purpose to obtain a profit with the result. I set up to work and composed, based on some verses in Spanish written for me by a Havanese poet, an opera in one act titled F√™te champ√™tre Cubaine (Cuban countryside feast).\\"Moreau Gottschalk, Louis: Notes of a pianist. Princeton University, 2006, p. 26. It is quite probable that Fiesta campestre Cubana would be the first opera that included elements of autochthonous Cuban music, because it is possible to clearly perceive in its music the Habanera-tango rhythm, previously utilized by Gottschalk so many times in other Cuban style pieces. Crist√≥bal D√≠az Ayala says about this subject: \\"‚Ä¶ \\"Escenas Campestres\\" presents a challenge: if it is the first Cuban opera or not; while Saumell envisioned for his \\"Antonelli\\" a text in Italian language, \\"Escenas Campestres\\" was written in Spanish, and its music has undoubtedly a certain creole flavor. But the critics, even from its time, and later, ignore this fact.\\"D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal: M√∫sica Cubana, del Areyto a la Nueva Trova, Ediciones Universal, Miami Florida, 1993, p. 46 Gaspar Villate y Montes was born in Havana, in 1851 and since an early age he showed a great musical talent. As a child, he began to study piano with Nicol√°s Ruiz Espadero and in 1867, when he was just 16 years old, he composed his first opera on a drama by Victor Hugo, titled Angelo, tirano de Padua. A year later, at the beginning of the 1868 war, he travelled to the United States with his family and upon his return to Havana in 1871 he wrote another opera called Las primeras armas de Richelieu. Villate travelled to France with the purpose to continue his music studies in the Paris Conservatory, where he received classes from Francois Bazin, Victorien de Joncieres and Adolphe Danhauser. He composed numerous instrumental pieces such as contradances, habaneras, romances and waltzes, and in 1877 he premiered with great audience acclaim his opera Zilia in Paris, which was presented in Havana in 1881. Since then, Villate focused his efforts mainly in opera and composed pieces such as La Zarina and Baltazar, premiered at La Haya and Teatro Real de Madrid respectively. It is known that he worked on an opera with a Cuban theme called Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, which manuscript has been lost. Villate passed away in Paris. In 1891. Soon after he had started to compose a lyric drama called Lucifer, from which some fragments have been preserved.Carpentier, Alejo: La m√∫sica en Cuba, Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1979, p. 207 ‚Äì 210. We should mention Laureano Fuentes Matons, Hubert de Blanck and Ignacio Cervantes among the Cuban opera composers from the 19th century. Laureano Fuentes Matons was born on July 3, 1825 in Santiago de Cuba and studied with Juan Par√≠s, Hierrezuelo and Casamitjana. He composed numerous orchestral and chamber works, as well as the opera Seila.Orovio, p. 87-88 Hubert de Blanck, Dutch pianist and composer established in Cuba, which founded a famous conservatory named after him, composed three operas titled Patria, Actea and Hicaona. According to Jorge Antonio Gonz√°lez, Patria was the first Cuban opera based on the Independence Wars theme.Gonz√°lez, p. 224 Ignacio Cervantes One of the most important Cuban composers, Ignacio Cervantes, wrote the lyric drama Maledetto and the comic opera Los Saltimbanquis, which was premiered in the Albisu theater of Havana, on January 25, 1901. Cervantes began to compose Maledetto in 1895, and was able to complete only two acts before his death in 1905.Gonz√°lez, p. 253-271 1901‚Äì1959 At the beginning of the 20th century three composers stand out in regard to operistic production, Eduardo S√°nchez de Fuentes, Jos√© Mauri Esteve and Bernardo Moncada. Eduardo S√°nchez de Fuentes was born in Havana in 1874, within an artistic family; his father was a writer and his mother a pianist and singer. He began his musical studies at Conservatorio Hubert de Blanck and at a later time took classes from Carlos Anckermann. He received also a Law Degree in 1894.Orovio, p, 196 When S√°nchez de Fuentes was just 18 years old, he composed the famous Habanera \\"T√∫\\", which became an extraordinary international success. Alejo Carpentier said it was: \\"the most famous Habanera\\".Carpentier, p. 221 On October 26th, 1898, S√°nchez de Fuentes premiered at the Albisu Theater in Havana his first opera called Yumuri, based on the Island's colonization theme. In it, an aborigine princess falls in love with a handsome Spanish conqueror, which abducts her at the wedding ceremony with another indigenous character. At the end, while escaping, both suffer a tragic death during an earthquake.Gonz√°lez, p. 253-271 At a later time, S√°nchez de Fuentes composed another five operas: El N√°ufrago (1901), Dolorosa (1910), Doreya (1918), El Caminante (1921) and Kabelia (1942).Gonz√°lez, p. 302 Jos√© Mauri Esteve composed numerous zarzuelas for the Alhambra Theater and one opera in three acts called La Esclava, premiered on June 6, 1921 at the Teatro Nacional;Orovio, p. 136 and Bernardo Moncada, born in Trinidad, in 1888, composed the lyrical drama Pasi√≥n Criolla, as well as the operas Teresa or El grito de Yara and Amara or Los adoradores del sol.Gonz√°lez, p.476-523 Also during the first half of the 20th century, the renowned composer Amadeo Rold√°n (1900-1939) wrote a so-called gaelic opera [sic.] in three acts, titled Deirdre, from which he could only complete two acts before his premature death. His contemporary, Alejandro Garc√≠a Caturla composed the opera Manita en el suelo with a script from Alejo Carpentier, based on an Afro-Cuban theme.Gonz√°lez, p. 533 1960 to present During the second half of the 20th century, the operistic production continued flourishing in Cuba, frequently incorporating modern composition technique, as well as contemporary themes. Natalio Gal√°n, born in Camag√ºey, in 1919, composed the opera los d√≠as llenos on a script by Ant√≥n Arrufat, utilizing serial techniques;Gonz√°lez, p. 551 and his colleague from the Renovaci√≥n Musical group, Hilario Gonz√°lez composed two operas: Las puertas abiertas (1964) and Clausura de un peque√±o burgu√©s.Gonz√°lez, p. 555 Among the members of the new generation of composers that began to produce mainly between the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, we should mention Roberto S√°nchez Ferrer, H√©ctor Angulo and Jos√© Loyola Fern√°ndez. Roberto S√°nchez Ferrer (born 1927) composed an opera inspired on the biography of the Vietnamese communist guerrilla fighter Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tr·ªói, which was captured in 1963 when he was trying to install an explosive artifact with the purpose to assassinate the US DS Robert Mc Namara. He was executed at a later time. In that opera, called Van Troi, S√°nchez Ferrer utilized Vietnamese melodies and serial techniques. H√©ctor Angulo (1932), composed a chamber opera titled Ibeyi A√±√°, based on an Afro-Cuban story by Lydia Cabrera; and Jos√© Loyola Fern√°ndez (1941) has an opera with an Afro-Cuban theme called Monz√≥n y el Rey de Kor√©.Gonz√°lez, p. 556-567 One of the most active and outstanding composers of his generation, Sergio Fern√°ndez Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso) (1946), is the author of an opera called La forma del camino, which also possesses the complementary title of s-XIV-69 (which means Siglo XIV ‚Äì 1969). With an approximate duration of 60 minutes, this piece utilizes as a script a story from the Popol Vuh (the sacred text of the Maya culture) about the mythic brothers Hunahpu and Ixbalanqu√©. The score includes soloists and a choir of nine mixed voices, accompanied by an instrumental group and an electro-acoustic quadraphonic system. The scene requires a stage elevated over the choir spatial position, which members wear dinner jackets, in opposition to the more casual attire of the soloists. All singers wear Indian masks.Gonz√°lez, p. 557 Renowned Cuban composer Roberto Valera has recently created an opera titled Cubanac√°n, based on the ambitious architectural project of the National Art Schools (Cuba), located in the Havana Cubanac√°n neighborhood; site of the Havana Country Club before the 1959 Cuban Revolution. That project has remained unfinished until present times.Bienal de La Habana. Opera Cubanac√°n Part of a more recent generation, composer Juan Pi√±era (born 1949) includes in his catalogue two operas: Amor con amor se paga from 1987, which consists of two acts and is based on a text by Jos√© Mart√≠; and La taza de caf√©, composed in 1989, with two acts and script by Juan Ram√≥n Am√°n based on a piece of the same name by Rolando Ferrer. Odaline de La Mart√≠nez (born 1949), Cuban composer established in Great Britain, has written an operatic trilogy based on an Afro-Caribbean theme.Fringe Opera: Francesca Wickers. The world's first Afro-Cuban opera about slavery. Interview with Odaline de la Martinez Also Cuban-American composer Orlando Jacinto Garc√≠a (born 1954) is the author of an opera titled Transcending Time, for soprano, instrumental and vocal chamber ensemble, electro-acoustic media and video, which was premiered in the Zagreb Biennial in Croatia by the ensemble Cantus. Most recently the work of two young Cuban composers stand out, Jorge Mart√≠n and Louis Franz Aguirre. Jorge Mart√≠n was born in Santiago de Cuba in 1959 and established his residence in the US at a very young age. He studied musical composition at the Yale and Columbia Universities. He has composed three lyric pieces: \\"Beast and Superbeast\\", a series of four operas in one act each, based on short stories by Saki; Tobermory, opera in one act that obtained first price in the Fifth Biennial of the National Opera Association (USA), and has been presented in several cities of the United States; and Before Night Falls, an opera based on the famous autobiography of the Cuban novelist, playwright and poet Reinaldo Arenas, renowned dissident from the Fidel Castro government.Cintas foundation: Jorge Mart√≠n Mart√≠n acquired the rights to the memoir in 1995 and spent 15 years working on the opera, which was finally premiered in 2010 by the Fort Worth Opera, its only performance so far. It got an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from audiences, and mixed reviews. The National Review said it was \\"brave, both in its libretto and in its score‚Ä¶ a worthy work of art; A moving story presented in a moving way.\\"The Miami Herald, \\"Before escaping Cuba, he was jailed for being outspoken and gay. Now, an opera tells his story.\\" Louis Franz Aguirre (born 1968) is currently one of the most prolific and renowned Cuban composers at an international level. His catalog includes four operatic works: Ebb√≥ (1998), premiered on January 17, 1999, at the Brotfabrik Theater in Bonn, Germany; Ogguanilebbe (Liturgy of the divine word) (2005), premiered in the Salla dil Parlamento d'il Castello di Udine, Italy.

Abellon gained fame as a noted preacher and confessor but became a prominent figure after tending to victims of the plague in Aix-en-Provence in 1445. He was also a noted artist and painter with some of his works still surviving at present. Abellon's beatification received approval from Pope Leo XIII on 19 August 1902. Life Andr√© Abellon was born in Provence in 1375. In his adolescence he had listened to the preaching of Vincent Ferrer and became resolved to imitate his pious life of apostolic zeal. To that end he joined the Order of Preachers at their convent in his hometown of Saint- Maximin and was ordained as a priest after his solemn profession. Abellon later became the prior of the Saint Mary Magdalene convent in Provence which was a neglected building though a noted pilgrimage site. It was said that Mary Magdalene went there to do penance for her sins and it laid claim to some of her relics. But Abellon also taught seminarians theological studies in Montpellier as well as in Avignon and Paris for a time. The humble friar supported the work of the missionaries and he often preached missions to the faithful while in 1445 tending to the victims of the plague in Aix which made him a well-known and beloved figure. Abellon was also a noted artist and painter for he had studied these subjects prior to entering the Dominicans. He tended to the spiritual needs of the pilgrims who came to the convent and he desired to establish a permanent foundation for that work at the shrine. To that end he obtained the financial support of the Queen of France who provided him with the funds needed to set up this new building. His artistic and architectural talents helped the project become a great success and restore fame to the pilgrimage site. He also established two mills near the shrine for the local farmers to support their agricultural needs. He died in 1450 and was interred in the convent he served in. Beatification Abellon's painting of Saint Martha and the dragon, or Tarasque (c. 1430). His beatification was approved on 19 August 1902 after Pope Leo XIII signed a decree that recognized the late priest's longstanding and popular \\"cultus\\" - or veneration - which acted as a prerequisite for beatification for older causes of sainthood.

The series was being produced by Marvel Television in association with FX Productions and ABC Signature Studios, with Donald and Stephen Glover serving as showrunners. Ordered straight-to-series by FXX in May 2017 following the successful partnership of Marvel Television and FX Productions in making the X-Men spin-off series Legion, 10 episodes were planned for the series to debut in 2018. Donald and Stephen Glover had begun work in a writers room by the time of the series' announcement. Early animation had been completed for the series that August, with the Glovers wanting a distinct voice and tone from previous incarnations of the character including the Deadpool films. The announcement of the series, and the involvement of Donald Glover specifically, was met with enthusiasm from commentators. However, in March 2018 FX Networks announced that it was no longer moving forward with the series after Marvel decided not to pursue the version of the series that the Glovers were creating. This was widely seen as disappointing and was met with criticism, including from Donald Glover himself who publicly suggested that racism may have contributed to Marvel's decision. Production =Announcement= After the success of Marvel Television and FX Networks' partnership to create the series Legion for FX, its sister channel FXX gave a 10-episode series order in May 2017 to an untitled adult animated comedy series based on the popular Marvel Comics character Deadpool. Marvel Television executives were fans of FXX's animated series Archer, and had approached FX about the idea a year after its president John Landgraf had detailed plans to have FXX \\"aggressively\\" make more adult animated series. FX approached Donald Glover, \\"a significant talent with increasing geek cred\\", and his brother Stephen to write, executive produce, and showrun the series. Donald Glover had an overall deal with FX Productions, a pre-established relationship with Marvel after starring in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and the brothers created the \\"breakout hit\\" Atlanta for FX. After \\"complex\\" negotiations, the series was announced as being produced by Marvel Television, FX Productions, and ABC Signature Studios, with Marvel's Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory also serving as executive producers. The series was to be titled Deadpool: The Animated Series. =Development= By the series' announcement, a writers room for the show had been established in London where Donald Glover was filming Solo: A Star Wars Story. Landgraf explained that FX was happy to accommodate the Glovers' busy schedule because of their talent and not wanting to \\"squelch\\" any opportunities that may come up for them. He added that the series would be different in voice and tone from the Deadpool films because of the difference between animation and live-action, and also because of the Glovers' own unique voice and tone. Making a series \\"that was distinctly different from the movies\\" was something that FX felt strongly about when taking on the project. With the announcement of the series and the involvement of Donald Glover, several outlets noted that his Atlanta co-star Zazie Beetz had just been cast as the comic character Domino in the film Deadpool 2. In May 2017, Beetz expressed interest in reprising her role in the series if the character was included. A brief clip from the series was available to be shown at FX's Television Critics Association press tour panel in August 2017, and Landgraf stated that animation would begin in full for the show later in the year, simultaneously with the filming of the second season of Atlanta. He added that a specific release schedule had not been decided on yet \\"because it‚Äôs gotta be great\\" first. Discussing pressure to live up to previous portrayals of Deadpool, Donald Glover said he did not feel any unlike in his work on Solo and Atlanta, especially because Deadpool \\"is very aware of himself\\". Stefani Robinson, a member of the series' writers room, said that they chose to interpret the original comics from \\"an angle that was very true to us and made sense to us\\", rather than look to the films or general public's perception of the character. She highlighted the fact that Deadpool cannot die, saying, \\"It's sort of fun to play with a character who can do anything, basically, and really get into the mentality of someone who is bored with life, who doesn't feel any stakes, doesn't feel any danger, and is like, 'OK ‚Äì This is just kind of my life, and what do I do with being someone who exists on a superior platform than everybody else?' What would you do if you lived forever, couldn't die?\\" =Cancellation= In March 2018, FX announced that it had decided not to move forward with the series, citing creative differences. Their statement added that the network, the Glovers, and Marvel Television agreed to \\"part ways\\". FX did clarify that their relationship with Marvel Television would continue with Legion. Donald Glover denied rumors that he was too busy to work on the series, and within a week of this announcement he wrote and released a 15-page script on his Twitter account titled \\"Finale\\". The script features Deadpool travelling to Kenya to protect the rhinoceros Sudan (who died several days earlier), and contemplating why the series was cancelled. The script was soon removed from Glover's account. In \\"Finale\\", Deadpool finds potential blame for the cancellation in comments written for the series about Marvel \\"trying to sell toys to 7-year-old boys and 50-year- old pedophiles\\"; notes the socio-political issues of depicting a \\"violent, gun-loving white man ranting on TV\\"; and suggests that Marvel and FX may have been racist in not wanting to make the series due to its all black writing staff and the black references they had been using in scripts. The latter point echoed earlier comments made by Glover that he needed a \\"white translator\\" to trick FX into allowing him and his black writing staff to make Atlanta the way they wanted to. Deadpool goes on to state in the script, > \\"It just feels like everyone wants something different, but no one wants to > do anything different to get it. Doesn't Marvel have enough feel-good > minority shows everyone supports but doesn't watch? I mean, I think our show > been funny. I just wanted a place to be honest. And I guess that place is > Freeform.\\" The script also mentioned an episode featuring Taylor Swift, which Stephen Glover confirmed existed, calling it \\"hilarious\\" and \\"the last straw\\" for Marvel. He added that the series \\"wasn‚Äôt too black. It wasn‚Äôt really that black at all. But we definitely wanted to give Rick and Morty a run for their money and I think we would have.\\" In August 2018, Landgraf was asked why FX had made the \\"shocking\\" decision to not move forward with the series, and he stated that Marvel had full control over the use of the character and decided not to pursue the version of the series that the Glovers wanted to make. Landgraf added that he had personally liked the work that the Glovers had done on the series, and that FX would have continued with that version if it was their decision. He believed that Marvel would eventually revive the series, but would \\"hire someone else to do a different show\\". Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld stated in May 2019 that a new animated series featuring the character was coming \\"sooner than later\\". Reception Ryan Reynolds, producer and star of the Deadpool films, was not involved with the series' development but described Donald Glover as a \\"genius\\" and lamented the news that the series would not be moving forward.

They wanted to modernise the country and its institutions: Ahmed Bey had set up a military academy at Le Bardo and begun training a larger army.Abi Dhiaf, Pr√©sent des hommes de notre temps. Chroniques des rois de Tunis et du pacte fondamental, vol. IV, √©d.

His successor Muhammad Bey was an ambitious palace- builder.Jacques Revault, Palais et r√©sidences d'√©t√© de la r√©gion de Tunis (XVI-XIX si√®cles), √©d. Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Paris, 1974, p.74http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/estournelles_paul_henri_de_constant/conquete_de_la_tunisie/conquete_de_la_tunisie.pdf p.45 accessed 7/7/2015 To fund these expensive new ventures, the Beys of Tunis relied on tax revenues paid on a customary basis. Most of the country paid the mejba () established in the seventeenth century under the Muradid dynasty. There is much scholarly debate about exactly what this constituted and how it was levied, but it appears that before 1856, the term mejba signified a tax paid by a tribe, clan or other social group, based on a collective assessment. The Beys also imposed monopoly taxes on salt, tobacco, tanned hides and other commodities. accessed 6/5/2017 = Muhammad Bey - the mejba and foreign influence = In 1856, Muhammad Bey embarked on a major fiscal reform. He gave up most of his taxes on commodities and agricultural goods (except for olive and date trees, oils and cereals) as well as the old mejba levies, and instituted a new capitation tax called the i'ana () which quickly also became known as the mejba, although it was a new tax calculated on a completely different basis--it was levied on individuals rather than on groups. This new mejba was fixed at 36 piastres per adult male per year. For most peasants, this equated to about 45 days' labour. To reduce potential unrest, the five largest towns--Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Monastir, Tunisia and Kairouan--were exempted. The new tax raised 9.7m piastres out of a total 22.95m piastres of government income. Although burdensome, the new mejba was not sufficient to eliminate the government deficit. The developing economy meant that increasingly gold and silver coin tended to fall into the hands of European merchants, who took it out of the country.

This created a new legal environment which encouraged Europeans to set up businesses in Tunisia.Ibn Abi Dhiaf, op. cit., p. 26 The new constitution was not popular.

The loan secured from Nassim Shamama was not sufficient to restore the Regency to financial health. Indeed, interest payments on the loan absorbed a huge proportion of state revenues. By 1862, the government debt had reached 28m piastres and civil servants were working for months unpaid. As a way out, Mustapha Khaznadar proposed that Sadok Bey take out the country's first ever foreign loan. Accordingly, on 6 May 1863, he concluded a loan with the French banker Erlanger in the amount of 35m francs. However by the time various intermediaries--including Mustapha Khaznadar himself--had extracted their fees from the gross amount, only 5,640,914 was ultimately paid over to the Bey's Treasury.http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/estournelles_paul_henri_de_constant/conquete_de_la_tunisie/conquete_de_la_tunisie.pdf pp.64-5 accessed 7/5/2017 The loan was repayable over fifteen and a half years at a rate of 4,200,000 francs per year (7m piastres). This revenue could not be raised from the existing means of taxation--the new mejba was now raising only 3m piastres a year--so a new, increased tax was required.Jean Ganiage, Les origines du Protectorat fran√ßais en Tunisie, √©d.

Outbreak of the revolt alt=Kheireddine Pacha high.JPG In September 1863 the decision was taken to apply the new mejba (or, properly, the i'ana) to the five towns that had previously been exempted, and to double the rate to 72 piastres per head.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., . This measure was vigorously opposed by the Bey's ex-Minister Kheireddine Pasha, General Hussein and General Farhat Gaied Jbira who served on the Supreme Council and was also the ca√Ød (governor) of El Kef. General Hussein exclaimed: 'the conditions of the country will not allow it to bear any more taxes. The country is in danger!' Kheireddine Pasha said that most of the additional revenue generated by the increase would be taken up by the cost of the army needed to raise it. The notables convened by Sadok Bey to hear his plans made clear that they would not be able to enforce them on their people.Bice Slama, L‚Äôinsurrection de 1864 en Tunisie, √©d. Maison Tunisienne de l‚Äô√âdition, Tunis, 1967, alt=General hessine.jpg =Murder of General Ferhat= As soon as the news spread, trouble broke out in the tribal regions. Caravans were looted and stocks of weapons and powder were built up. In an attempt to calm the growing unrest, a decree of 22 March 1864 modified the new mejba again, making it into a progressive tax. Those eligible to pay were graded into six categories on the basis of their wealth, and the mejba applied to them on a scale of 36 to 108 piastres. It was however stipulated that the average rate paid by the population under each ca√Ød was to remain at 72 piastres. accessed 8/5/2017 To show the government's determination to push ahead with the new tax, the Bey ordered all governors to return to their posts and begin implementing it.Bice Slama op. cit., Obeying this order, General Farhat began the journey to his post as governor of El Kef and the Ounifa tribe on 16 April 1864. As the region around El Kef was now in revolt, he asked for an armed escort, but the Bey had no men to spare. Farhat therefore asked his deputy to come out to meet him with 150 spahis from the town. Ignoring his deputy's advice not to proceed because of the danger, he continued to make for his post as ordered. When he reached the pass at Khanguet el Gdim, 21 km from El Kef, he was surrounded by insurgents. The spahis, who came from the same tribe as them, did not want to fight them, and melted away, leaving him only with eight of his attendants. All were slaughtered.Bice Slama op. cit., The olive tree, pockmarked with bullets, where he met his end was venerated for many years until it was cut down and burned in around 1950.Nouri Boudali, Protectorat et ind√©pendance, √©d.

El Kef was besieged by surrounding tribes, while the authorities refused to let them enter the town. The Governor of Kairouan, General Rashid, took refuge in a house with was then surrounded; the defenders opened fire and killed some of the attackers. After a tense negotiation, the General was allowed to leave for Sousse, but the countryside was so hostile that from there, he was obliged to make for Tunis on a British ship. A provisional government was set up by the rebels in Kairouan after he departed. Similar incidents unfolded across much of north an interior of the country. At B√©ja, T√©boursouk, Makthar and Jendouba, the governors were forced to flee for their lives and their property was looted. The governor of the Majer tribe in the Thala region was not so fortunate. Besieged in his fortress, he killed dozens of attackers before it fell. He was killed, along with his entire family, and his body decapitated on 21 May.Bice Slama, op. cit., p. 26-31 The dead governor's secretary, Ali Ben Ghedhahem (), born in 1814 in Sbe√Øtla,Arthur Pellegrin, Histoire de la Tunisie : depuis les origines jusqu'√† nos jours, √©d.

When the Bey's soldiers came to his region to collect the mejba, he told people to disobey, and was obliged to flee for safety to the mountains near Oueslatia and Bargou. From here, he began to organise resistance, and soon other tribes began to rally to him.Habib Missaoui, ¬´ Sur les traces de Ben Oun ¬´ Khannag Larou√¢h ¬ª (Preneur des √¢mes) : le petit-fils de Ali Ben Ghedhahem El Mejri ¬ª, Le Quotidien, date unknown The unorganised revolt of the Mth√©lith, the Zlass, the Majer and the Fraichiche who camped near the Algerian frontier coalesced into a definite movement as tribal notables came together to swear solemn oaths and began to unite around specific demands‚Äîa return to traditional justice and taxation.

While seeking to calm the unrest by revoking the constitution of 1861 and announcing that the mejba would not after all be doubled, he therefore prepared his forces and opened clandestine negotiations with Ben Ghedhahem through the Maliki Grand Mufti Ahmed Ben Hussein and the head of the Rahmaniyya sufi order, Mustapha Ben Azouz.http://www.tunezine.tn/read.php?1,83475 accessed 10/5/2017 =Uprising in the Sahel= the frigate Giuseppe Garibaldi Despite these negotiations however, the rebellion spread to the coastal towns of the Sahel region as well.

Throughout the country, the tribes rose up and threatened anyone who refused to join them, plundering the property of government officials.  European and Ottoman intervention The French government instructed its consul Charles de Beauval not to involve himself in the internal politics of the Regency, but despite this, he did not hesitate to advise Sadok Bey to revoke his reforms, suspend the constitution, and send Khaznadar away.https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01402235/document p.342 accessed 9/05/2017 The British government had likewise given its consul Richard Wood instructions to keep out of the dispute,https://halshs.archives- ouvertes.fr/tel-01402235/document p. 341 accessed 9/5/2017 but he nevertheless offered the Bey the opposite advice-- to support Khaznadar and maintain the new constitution, while cancelling the doubling of the mejba.Bice Slama, op. cit., Mongi Smida, op. cit., With the official justification of concern for their expatriates, Britain France and Italy all sent naval forces to cruise the Tunisian coasts.

He was welcomed enthusiastically by the people of Tunis who feared that European soldiers were about to land in the country.Bice Slama, op. cit., His real purpose was to take advantage of the situation to bring Tunis back under closer Ottoman rule. He proposed that Sadok Bey sign an agreement undertaking not to enter into any treaty with another power without the Sultan's consent, pay 3m piastres a year in tribute, and present himself in Istanbul to receive an Imperial investiture. Even the British consul, who favoured maximum Ottoman influence in Tunisia to frustrate the French, would not support these demands, and the agreement was never signed.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., This did not prevent the British consul from making contact with the rebels to warn them about French intentionshttps://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01402235/document p.346accesssed 9/5/2017 and remind them of the friendly ties between Britain and the Ottoman Empire, which counted for much with a population hoping for an Ottoman intervention to persuade the Bey to reduce his demands.Bice Slama, op. cit., At the same time, despite his instruction, De Beaval sought to use the crisis to strengthen France's role in the country. He made contact with Ben Gedhahem and assured him that the aim of the French warships was to support his demands and that he was seeking to secure the dismissal of the Grand Vizier.Bice Slama, op. cit., Led by De Beauval, the French Foreign Minister √âdouard Drouyn de Lhuys backed his approach and even considered replacing Sadok Bey himself if circumstances allowed. On 29 a June a column of 3,000 soldiers in Algeria was moved up to the Tunisian border in readiness for any eventuality.Bice Slama, op. cit., However the rebel leader ignored these overtures and forwarded the French letters to Khaznadar, who passed them on to the British. The resulting scandal was such that De Beauval was forced to leave the country in January 1865.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Meanwhile the Italian government planned to land an expeditionary force of 10,000 in Tunis in June 1864 to take control of the capital and the main coastal towns. However the Italian press broke the story of preparations in the port of Genoa and in the face of British anger, the plan was abandoned.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Ultimately, none of the European powers wanted to risk starting a major international incident by taking too bold a stance in Tunisia. Accordingly, on 23 September 1864, they agreed to withdraw their navies and allowed the Bey to put down the rebellion without further interference.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Haydar Effendi also departed on the same day.G. S. van Krieken, Khayr al-D√Æn et la Tunisie, Brill Archive, 1976 p.102 Meanwhile, the Receiver-General Nassim Shamama, who had both lent money to Sadok Bey in 1862 and helped Khaznadar arrange the Erlanger loan in 1863 left for Paris on 8 June 1864 on an official mission to negotiate a new loan. Instead however he took with him many compromising government papers and 20m piastres and never returned to Tunis. After his death in 1873 in Livorno the Tunisian government pursued his heirs through the courts to recuperate some of the money he had stolen.  Waning of the revolt  The Ottoman envoy's mission had been a godsend for the Bey. Not only did he make a show of force to deter the European powers, he also brought desperately-needed financial support in the amount of 0.5m francs in gold coin.G. S. van Krieken, Khayr al-D√Æn et la Tunisie, Brill Archive, 1976 p.101 At the same time the government was able to raise further funds by selling the coming olive harvest to European traders in advance, with Khaznadar once again profiting from the transaction. This allowed the Bey to re-recruit 2,000 zouaoua troops who had been dismissed from service by his predecessor Muhammad Bey for grave indiscipline. As they were Kabyles from Algeria, their loyalty could be relied on as they had no ties to the Arab tribal leaders of the rebellion. The Bey was also able to use some of this money to begin buying off some of the tribal leaders, and mistrust started to spread among the rebels. The fear grew that if the uprising continued, the country would end up being occupied by the French army.Bice Slama, op. cit., The rebellion began to falter. In the countryside, people wanted to return to their fields in time for the harvest; in the coastal towns, fear of brigandage by the nomadic tribes led by Ali Ben Ghedhahem made them wary of throwing their lot in with the insurgents of the interior.https://halshs.archives- ouvertes.fr/tel-01402235/document p.365 accessed 9/5/2017 On 29 June 1864 a military column headed by General Ismail Es-Sunni Saheb at-Taba'a marched out from Tunis to meet Ben Ghedhahem and offer him an amnesty (aman). As the price of his surrender, Ben Ghedhahem asked for the estate of Henchir Rohia for himself, the ca√Ødship of the Majer for his brother and various other positions for his friends. The rebels' other demands were: * Total amnesty for all past acts * Implementation of sharia law * Closing of the new courts and restitution of traditional justice * Removal of all special protections for all foreigners throughout the Regency * Capping the mejba at 10 piastres per adult man * Capping the 'achour' (tithe on cereal crops) at 10 piastres per m√©chia (12-18 hectares) * Abolition of the 'maks' (transaction tax) outside the souks * Restoration of the slave trade * Removal of the Turkish and mamluk ca√Øds and requirement for them to submit their accounts to scrutiny * Restoration of the tax on palm trees and olive trees at the old rates established by Ahmad Bey * Waiver of all other demands on the Bey's subjects * Restoration of the traditional management of habous land On 19 July Sadok Bey agreed to give Ben Ghedhahem an amnesty, making sure that his requests for personal rewards were widely publicised to undermine him among his followers. On 28 July, the Bey also announced his acceptance of most of Ghedhahem's terms. The mejba was to be reduced to 20 piastres, the achour halved, the maks abolished and the Turkish and mamluk ca√Øds replaced with Tunisian Arabs.Bice Slama, op. cit., Jean Ganiage, op. cit., It did not take Ben Ghedhahem long to realise he had been duped. The rewards he sought were never granted. The old ca√Øds remained in place. The mejba continued to be levied at the exorbitant rate of 72 piastres and all of the other taxes remained in force. On 9 August a military column headed by General Rustum headed for El Kef with the intention of punishing the murderers of General Farhat, despite the fact the Bey had announced a total amnesty. Ben Ghedhahem found that he could not rally the tribes to resist, as the Bey's money had bought some of them off. The tribes started to quarrel - Ben Ghedhahem's own tribe was attacked by the Hamma tribe - and turned to unrestrained looting rather than concerted resistance.Bice Slama, op. cit.,  Repression  = Reprisals in the Sahel = Battle of Kal√¢a Kebira, 7 October 1864 Negotiations between Ben Ghedhahem and the Bey did nothing to discourage the rebels of the coastal towns. The arrival of General Osman in Sousse to recruit soldiers raised tensions once again. From 23 July, the town was besieged by the inhabitants of nearby towns who wanted him gone and the new taxes abolished. The people of Monastir, Tunisia refused to send help to Osman and even, on 11 September, refused to allow General Slim to land in the town, after he had been sent by the Bey to rally them.Bice Slama, op. cit., On 29 August, a mhalla (military column) headed by General Ahmad Zarrouk set out from Tunis for the Sahel region.Bice Slama, op. cit., It advanced slowly - time was on the Bey's side as harvest approached and the tribes were becoming ever more disunited. On 5 October, to cut the column off from resupply, the rebels decided to take the town of Kal√¢a Kebira near Sousse, which resisted their advance. Zarrrouk marched to the relief of the town and inflicted a crushing defeat on the rebels two days later. Rebel elements fled to the neighbouring village of Kal√¢a Seghira where they were caught by the soldiers who massacred them and plundered the village. News of this outrage terrified the neighbouring area, where towns and villages now offered their submission without further resistance.Bice Slama, op. cit., The conditions imposed by Zarrouk were pitiless. The leaders of the revolt were hanged or shot. Notables were imprisoned and tortured to make them reveal the names of ringleaders. Even women and old men were tortured. Hundreds of sheikhs suspected of disloyalty were chained together by the ankle. Soldiers who had abandoned their posts were interned and sent back to Tunis, where they were treated as prisoners of war. Religious leaders were dismissed. The zouaoua and those tribes which had remained loyal, or returned to loyalty early enough, laid waste to the countryside and subjected it to a reign of terror. To consolidate his authority, Zarrouk was made ca√Ød of Sousse and Monastir.Bice Slama, op. cit., The Bey was now determined to make the rebel areas pay for the cost of the war. On top of his already unmanageable debts, he owed European traders for additional loans incurred to pay for the arming of his soldiers. The Sahel towns of Sousse, Mahdia and Monastir had previously been assessed for 3.5m piastres in tax payments - now the Bey demanded 25m from them. To pay for these exactions, the people had to sell their property or pawn it to middlemen, associates of Zarrouk, who charged interest at 40% per year. The oil harvest for 1865 was sold in advance to these middlemen. Wealthy townspeople were tortured until they revealed their hidden riches. They were made to pay to avoid the rape of their wives or to avoid shame of having the rape publicly announced.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., In 1973, the then President of Tunisia Habib Bourguiba (born in Monastir in 1903) spoke of the impact on his family of the repression after the Mejba Revolt. > 'To compel the people to give up their goods, (General) Zarrouk put many > notables in irons and locked them up; one of them was my grandfather.

Fields were plundered and herds driven off. Only the nomads escaped the punitive action by fleeing into Tripolitania. When Zarrouk's column returned to Tunis on 30 July 1865, the centre and south of the country had been brutalised and plundered on an enormous scale for nearly a year.Bice Slama, op. cit., = Harrying the north= In the North, the troops of ‚ÄôAli Ben Ghedhahem tried to oppose the advance of a General Rustum's column as it approached El Kef. Some of his close allies were however betrayed and handed over to the Bey's forces. His lieutenant was given a thousand strokes with a stick in front of the women of the harem in the Bardo palace, and thrown barely alive into a dungeon. Soon a second mhalla under Ali Bey joined up with Rustum's forces. To avoid annihilation, Ben Ghedhahem and 5,000 of his men slipped away over the Algerian border to take refuge with the Nemencha people in January 1865.Bice Slama, op. cit., With him out of the way, the northwest was subjected to the same exactions as the Sahel and fines were imposed, though as more of the population were nomadic they could more easily evade the army by moving around. Crops and herds were seized as elsewhere, but as prices collapsed there was little value in them. The army therefore resorted to gruesome extorsions from even those settled areas which had remained loyal.Bice Slama, op. cit., Steps in front of the Bardo palace where the prisoners were bastonaded Two hundred prisoners were sent, loaded with chains, to the Bardo palace, despite having bring promised amnesty. Condemned to the bastinado, they were beaten under the balconies of the Bey, in front of the steps leading up to the Hall of Justice, so that all could see their punishment and hear their pleas for mercy. For ten days the tribal sheikhs, their wrists and ankles bound and their faces to the ground, were savagely beaten, receiving up to 2,000 blows. Sixteen of them died quickly, and most of the rest did not long survive the dungeons.Bice Slama, op. cit., Ali Bey returned to the Bardo on 27 April 1865 with more notables as prisoners, from whom he intended to extort further wealth. On 5 September he set off again for B√©ja, which he planned to hold to ransom. Anyone suspected of owning any wealth was thrown in prison until their family bought their freedom. Here too, the region was utterly ruined and only those who managed to escape into the mountains held on to any possessions.Bice Slam op. cit., = The end of Ali Ben Ghedhahem = In January 1865 Ali Ben Ghedhahem and his brother Abd En Nebi were taken under watch to Constantine while his men were disarmed and interned by the French. The French treated them well, as they saw him as a potential ally in the event of a future conquest of the country. On 5 February Sadok Bey granted a fresh amnesty to the rebels who had fled, but not to the Ben Ghedhahem brothers. At the same time, the Bey made secret contact with them, claiming that the French were making preparations to betray them and deliver them both to him at the Bardo. Finally, missing his homeland, Ali Ben Ghedhahem took flight on 17 November 1865 and returned to Tunisia, hiding out in the Regba massif near the border at Ghardimaou. The Bey's armies under General Slim laid siege to him but the mountain people refused to give him up. Some tribal leaders tried to persuade him to resume armed resistance in order to end the reprisals and extortions the army was inflicting on their region, but he refused. All he wanted was a pardon from the Bey so he could return to normal life. Eventually, he was persuaded to place himself under the protection of an Algerian marabout of the Tijaniyya order, Mohammed el A√Ød, who was on his way to Mecca by way of Tunis. On 25 February 1866, Ben Ghedhahem joined his caravan at El Ksour. The ca√Ød of El Kef wanted to arrest him, but his soldiers refused to do so. On 28 February, having reached T√©boursouk, he was captured by cavalry sent out by the Bey. His brother managed to escape.Bice Slama, op. cit., He was brought to the Bardo palace on 2 March where he was subjected to insults and the blows of his captors. His only hope was the protection of the holy man with whom he had been travelling, but Mohammed el A√Ød continued on his way to Mecca on a steamship specially provided by the Bey. He remained in prison until his death on 11 October 1867.Bice Slama, op. cit.,  Aftermath  = Ruin of the countryside = Much of the countryside was laid waste. The harvests had all been seized and sold, reducing the people to famine for three years. People ate herbs and roots, and there were even reports of desperate people eating children in some areas. In the wake of the hunger came cholera, in 1865, 1866 and 1867, and there was a typhus outbreak in 1867. > 'Dead bodies lay in the roads, unburied.

Librairie Armand Colin, 1913, Paris, = Debt crisis = Sadok Bey, with Khaznadar just behind him The extorsions of Zarrouk and the other commanders did much to enrich them, but nothing to improve the government's finances. With no other recourse, Sadok Bey was persuaded by Khaznadar to take out yet another foreign loan, on which Khaznadar once again made substantial commissions. As Nassim Shamama had fled in June 1864, the following month a loan of 5m francs was arranged with a Jewish financier named Morpurgo from Alexandria, of which only 0.5m found their way to the treasury.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., A new contract was signed with the Erlanger Bank on 1 November 1864 for 15m francs guaranteed by customs revenues. A further 10m francs was subscribed several weeks later by the Oppenheim Bank, guaranteed by the tax on olive trees.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., As loan after loan was subscribed on terms very favourable to lenders, the Paris market was euphoric, and loans to Tunisia as well as to Egypt and the Ottoman Empire were known as ‚Äúturban securities.‚Äù The newspapers carried upbeat accounts of the commercial opportunities. As the Tunisian economy collapsed, La Semaine financi√®re wrote of the 1865 loan: ‚ÄúToday, the Bey of Tunis is under the moral protection of France, which takes an interest in the Tunisian people‚Äôs prosperity, since this prosperity also implies Algeria‚Äôs safety‚Äù.http://www.cadtm.org/Debt-how-France-appropriated#nb2-8 accessed 10/5/2017 The collapse of agricultural production made the repayment of these loans impossible. They could only be paid with funds secured from a further loan of 5m francs in June 1865.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., In January 1866, the European banks were approached again for 115m francs, which could not be raised.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., To avoid a default, a new loan of 100m francs was launched on 9 February 1867, to pay off the commitments from 1863 and 1865, guaranteed against the receipts of those taxes which could still be levied.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., By 1868, the state was effectively bankrupt; foreign creditors were no longer being paid, and they called on their governments to intervene. A beylical decree of 5 July 1869 established the International Debt Commission and gave it control over the entire taxation system of the country.Mongi Smida, op. cit., = Rebellion of 1867 = Unrest broke out again in 1867 in the northwestern border region of Kroumirie. The kroumirs lived an independent existence in their forests, and the government in Tunis did not have the means or the will to bring them firmly under its rule. The rebellion might therefore have remained a local affair, but on 11 September 1867, the government learned to its astonishment that Sadok Bey's youngest half-brother, Sidi Adel, had escaped from the palace in the night, travelled west, and placed himself at the head of the rebels, proclaiming himself Bey. He was accompanied by a number of high-ranking officials, who were deeply dissatisfied with the continued influence of Mustapha Khaznadar and the damaging effect it was having on the country.http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/21378-un-prince-chez-les- montagnards-khroumirs-la-rebellion-du-prince-el-adel-bey-en-1867 accessed 10/5/2017 Sadok Bey confined himself in the Bardo palace, but sent the Bey al- Mahalla, Ali Bey, to Kroumirie with an armed force. Sidi Adel fell ill and the Kroumirs surrendered him to his nephew in exchange for an amnesty, which, as ever, the Bey did not honour. Ben Dhiaf recorded that the reason the Kroumirs were so easily persuaded to submit was that after the repression and destruction of 1865, they were literally starving. Sidi Adel was taken back to the Bardo where he died in 8 October 1867. A few days previously, on 4 October, Sadok Bey took steps to eliminate anyone on whose loyalty he could not safely rely on. Among those ordered to be strangled were Si Rachid, who had commanded the Tunisian forces in the Crimean War, and Ismail Es-Sunni Isma√Øl Sahib Et-Taba√¢, his brother in law, who had negotiated with Ali Ben Ghedhahem in 1864. Their fortunes were confiscated. It was at this point, after two years of confinement, that Ali Ben Ghedhahem was killed, for fear that he might escape. Many others were also eliminated at this time to remove all possible threat to the Bey. http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/estournelles_paul_henri_de_constant/conquete_de_la_tunisie/conquete_de_la_tunisie.pdf accessed 10/5/2017 Mustapha Khaznadar remained Grand Vizier until 1873, and Sadok Bey ruled until 1882.

The statue St. John of Nepomuk in Divina  The project of restoration The statue St. John of Nepomuk in Divina was carried out under auspices of the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Slovakia. St. John of Nepomuk is one of the most frequently illustrated saints in the territory of the former Habsburg monarchy and there are monuments (mostly statues) of him in almost every village in Slovak and Czech republic. The, until now, unknown story of the statue of St. John of Nepomuk in Divina goes back to canonical visitation of the Divina parish on 1 September 1828, which provides the first reference of the time of origin of the statue ‚Äì 1796. As referred to by the canonical visitation, the statue was damaged by a massive flood in 1822. Partners, who were addressed by Marek Sobola, the author of the project, to cooperate have either some connection to St. John of Nepomuk or to Slovakia. The project was honoured by patronage of His Majesty Norodom Sihamoni, the King of Cambodia and His Majesty Simeon II., the last Tsar of Bulgaria. Along with the Roman Catholic Diocese of ≈Ωilina, the project donors are: His Royal Highness Franz, Duke of Bavaria, The Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (Ordo Equestris Sancti Sepulcri Hierosolymitani), The Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, the only Catholic knight order or Czech origin (Ordo militaris Crucigerorum cum rubea stella in pede pontis Pragensis), Metropolitan Chapter House of St. Vitus in Prague, which is the owner of the saint's grave and the town Nepomuk ‚Äì the birthplace of St. John of Nepomuk. Out of domestic partners, the project was supported by municipalities of Divina, Divinka‚ÄìLalinok, Svedern√≠k and the Philatelist Club 53-19 from ≈Ωilina. The ceremonial holy mass in the St. Andrew's Church in Divina was on Friday 2 June 2017. After the holy mass, the statue was uncovered on its new stand by Joachim Bleicker, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany in Slovakia together with Emil Molko, Mayor of Divina and author of the project. Subsequently, it was blessed by Mons. Tom√°≈° Galis, Bishop of ≈Ωilina.  Publications  # SOBOLA, Marek (ed.): Divinka Lalinok.

Known for his research on radio galaxies, quasars and observational cosmology, Kapahi was an elected fellow of all the three major Indian science academies ‚Äì Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India ‚Äì as well as of the Maharashtra Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology for his contributions to physical sciences in 1987.  Biography  Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Vijay Kumar Kapahi was born on 21 January 1944 at Quetta in British India. His pre- graduate and graduate studies were completed at St. Joseph's College, Bangalore (then under Mysore University) in 1959 and 1962 respectively before his move to Mumbai where he did a one-year course at BARC Training School. In 1963, he joined the Radio Astronomy Group of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and this gave him the opportunity to work with Govind Swarup, who would later design the Ooty Radio Telescope. During his service at TIFR, he simultaneously pursued his doctoral studies mentored by Swarup and secured a PhD from Bombay University in 1975 for his thesis, Angular structures of extragalactic radio sources and cosmology. The Radio Astronomy Group meanwhile developed into an autonomous division of TIFR, with a new name, National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, and he served as the director of the institution since 1994. He was holding the position and simultaneously serving as a professor at TIFR at the time of his death at the age of 55 on 16 March 1999. In between., he also served as a visiting scientist at Carnegie Institution for Science, Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Dwingeloo Radio Observatory.  Legacy  False-colour image of the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. Kapahi's work was mainly focused on observational cosmology and his work covered the studies of radio galaxies and quasars. During his doctoral studies under the guidance of Govind Swarup, together they developed an imaging technique for capturing rapid images of solar radio bursts and the details were published by way of an article, A simple image forming technique suitable for multifrequency observations of solar radio bursts in Solar Physics journal in 1970. Through his studies with the help of Ooty Radio Telescope, he discovered for the first time in 1975 that radio galaxies were smaller in linear sizes during earlier cosmic epochs. He was one of the first astronomers to study Compact Steep‚ÄêSpectrum radio sources and he published a series of articles on the subject during 1981‚Äì98. These studies assisted in the later-day development of a paradigm known as unifying scheme of radio galaxies and quasers which explained the relativistic beaming in nuclear jets of quasars and in integrating the properties of lobe-dominated and core- dominated types of quasars. His work with Very-long-baseline interferometry telescopes helped discover hot spots on the twin-lobes of extragalactic radio sources as well as distant radio galaxies. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 101 of them. Besides, he edited five books including Quasars: proceedings of the 119th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union, Lectures on Observational Cosmology, Proceedings of the Workshop Diffuse Thermal and Relativistic Plasma in Galaxy Clusters and Asian- Pacific Astronomy: Proceedings of the 6th Asian- Pacific Regional Meeting on Astronomy of the International Astronomical Union. He also contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has drawn citations from other scientists. Kapahi was directly involved in the establishment of the Ooty Radio Telescope, especially in the development of phase-shifter array. Later, he was involved in the development and establishment of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune which was the core theme of two of his articles published in 1991 and 1995 respectively. His contributions were reported in the initiation of the Joint Astronomy Programme of the Indian Institute of Science and he was associated with the Astronomical Society of India which he presided from 1997 until his death in 1999. He was also a member of the Indian Physics Association and International Astronomical Union and the doctoral scholars mentored by him included Joydeep Bagchi, Dhruba Jyoti Saikia, Prajval Shastri, C. H. Ishwar-Chandra and Ramana Athreya.  Awards and honors  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded Kapahi the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in 1987. He received two more honors in 1987; the Physical Research Laboratory selected him for Hari Om Ashram Prerit Vikram Sarabhai Research Award and the Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as their fellow. He received the Henri Chretien Research Grant Award of the American Astronomical Society in 1991 and became an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy in 1997.

History In March 2017, the Chamber of Deputies asked Andrej Babi≈°, leader of ANO 2011 and Minister of Finance, to explain his finances. In April 2017, he stated in a letter that all his financial activities have always been legal. Speaker of the chamber Jan Ham√°ƒçek (ƒåSSD) said that he did not consider the explanation sufficient. On 2 May 2017, Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ƒåSSD) stated that Babi≈° should resign. Bohuslav Sobotka announced on 2 May that he would resign, leading to the formation of a new cabinet which would not include Babi≈°. Babi≈° described Sobotka's decision as a \\"dirty trick.\\" Lubom√≠r Zaor√°lek and Milan Chovanec (both ƒåSSD) were mentioned as possible replacements for Sobotka as Prime Minister. Sobotka initially planned to submit his resignation to President Milo≈° Zeman on 4 May 2017, but later decided to resign on 20 May, when Zeman returns from a visit to China. However, Zeman proceeded with the resignation ceremony nonetheless, which was considered a humiliation for Sobotka. Sobotka decided not to resign after the ceremony, and on 5 May 2017 he announced that he would instead dismiss Babi≈° from government. Sobotka's decision was praised by the leaders of TOP 09, and KDU‚ÄìƒåSL. Petr Fiala, leader of ODS, called for a snap election, and stated that Sobotka's decision would only deepen the crisis. Various politicians stated that the resignation ceremony was shameful for the Czech Republic. Zeman announced on 8 May 2017 that he would not accept Babi≈°'s removal from the government yet, and would make a final decision on his return from China. This decision was criticised by many politicians and lawyers as unconstitutional, as according to the Czech constitution the president should appoint or dismiss ministers on the request of the Prime Minister. On 10 May 2017, a demonstration of 20,000 people was held in Prague against the actions of Zeman and Babi≈°, and other demonstrations were held around the country. Zeman called a meeting of leaders of coalition parties in Liberec. Sobotka was unable to participate as he had gone to Luxembourg on 10 May, but Zeman met Chovanec, Babi≈° and Pavel Bƒõlobr√°dek. Zeman presented the two possible solutions to the crisis as a new election, or a new government without Sobotka or Babi≈°. ANO 2011 stated that they were prepared to discuss a government that would not include Sobotka or Babi≈°. ƒåSSD and KDU-ƒåSL stated that they would consider a government without ANO.

In Canada, education is exclusively a provincial or territorial responsibility, though the federal government can intervene in areas relevant to open education.  Initiatives  The open educational resources (OER) movement in Canada can be categorized in different ways, from type of initiative to geographical location to institutional initiative. The initiatives described below are categorized accordingly. = Pan-Canadian initiatives =  Open data  The Canadian government initiated an open data pilot project in 2012 using an open government licence, similar to the Creative Commons (CC) attribution non- commercial licence (CC BY-NC), allowing for remixing and non-commercial uses. In April 2014 Industry Canada launched Digital Canada 150, which aims to support \\"connecting, and protecting Canadians, economic opportunities, digital government and Canadian content.\\" CANARIE is a federally funded corporation that manages and develops digital research infrastructure for research and education, operating the backbone network of Canada's National Research and Education Network. Along with the National Research Council's (NRC) Knowledge Management and the Canadian Association of Research Libraries, CANARIE supports Research Data Canada in meeting researcher needs in the coordination and promotion of data management. The strategy includes developing open science and open data to facilitate easy and open access to publications and related data resulting from federally funded research.  Creative Commons Canada  The creation and use of OER benefits from the development and use of Creative Commons licences, which provide the legal framework to share these resources. A non-profit organization, Creative Common Canada (CC Canada) supports a legal and technical infrastructure for openness. It has created a set of free licensing tools permitting authors and developers to share, re-use and remix materials with an explicit \\"some rights reserved but others clearly allowed\\" approach to copyright. As an affiliate of the larger body, CC Canada is a collaborative initiative made up of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC) at the University of Ottawa, BCcampus, and Athabasca University (AU). In addition to helping users choose licences and find Creative Commons-licensed work, CC Canada is a proponent of open government and the philosophy that government data should be accessible, shareable and reusable under open licences by everyone. It is actively involved in this pursuit, studying how CC licences can be used by governments to make data freely available for public use. Another CC Canada project is being spearheaded by its legal team at CIPPIC, which is researching the development of user-friendly tools that will provide comprehensive knowledge on how to analyse and use different open licences. CC Canada has also launched a series of conferences across the country to raise awareness of Creative Commons and its potential for educators, writers, artists, and others. In May 2014, Ryan Merkley, a Canadian, was appointed CEO of Creative Commons worldwide.  Council of Ministers of Education of Canada  The Council of Ministers of Education of Canada (CMEC) is an organization of 13 provincial and territorial ministries of education. In response to UNESCO's 2012 Paris Declaration on OER, CMEC first discussed OER at a national meeting in 2012. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to open access and to adapt educational practices to the new realities of information sharing. After further discussions in 2013, the ministers unanimously endorsed the Paris Declaration. This has played an important role in the growing support for OER across Canada and has been instrumental in the establishment of OER initiatives in the western provinces.  Tri-agency open access policy  The three Canadian research-funding agencies ‚Äì the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) ‚Äì have agreed on a draft policy supporting open access in scholarly publications. These agencies strongly support knowledge sharing and research collaboration, both domestically and internationally. = National and international initiatives = Several OER initiatives in Canada feature national and international collaboration.  OER universitas  OER universitas (OERu) offers free online university courses in collaboration with Canadian partners, offering formal credentials from the partner institutions. OERu is a consortium of more than 36 institutions and several organizations on five continents. It is dedicated to widening access and reducing the cost of post-secondary education for learners by providing OER pathways to achieve formal credentials.McGreal, R., Mackintosh, W., & Taylor, J. (2013). Open Educational Resources university: An assessment and credit for students' initiative. In R. McGreal, W. Kinutha, & S. Marshall (Eds.), Open Educational Resources: Innovation research and practice. Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from http://www.col.org/PublicationDocuments/ pub_PS_OER- IRP_web.pdf There are seven members of the OERu in Canada: three universities (Athabasca in Alberta and Thompson Rivers and Kwantlen in British Columbia); one community college (Portage College in Alberta); and three organisations (BCcampus, eCampus Alberta, and Contact North in Ontario).  BCcampus  BCcampus, arguably the most-active collaborative Canadian organization in the open practices arena, is a publicly funded service that has turned to open concepts and methods to create a sustainable approach to online learning for the public post-secondary institutions of British Columbia (BC). BCcampus was created to enhance students' ability not only to identify, choose, register for and take courses, but also to apply any academic credits earned to credentials at a selected home institution. It was intended to benefit institutions through the rationalization of demand for academic opportunities from students with the supply of online courses from BC's public post- secondary institutions. BCcampus has been the leader in Canada in promoting OER with CMEC. BCcampus played a major role in the decision by the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology to support and implement the Open Textbook Project, which started with a commitment to provide 40 open textbooks at the post-secondary level and is now committed to 60.BCcampus. (2014, February 20). 5 questions with Mary Burgess on our Open Textbook Project and the future of open education. Retrieved from http://bccampus. ca/2014/02/20/5-questions-with-mary-burgess-on-our-open-textbook-project-and- the-future-of-open-education/ BCcampus hosted a working forum on OER for senior post-secondary institution representatives in Vancouver in October 2012, with the objective of developing a common understanding of what OER could mean for the province and of building a shared vision of how to develop and use the resources. The session also studied ways that BC could take advantage of the promise of OER and, specifically, of open textbooks. The BCcampus Shareable Online Learning Resources repository (SOL*R) enables the licensing of, contribution to, and access to free online teaching and learning resources. Other BCcampus initiatives are also underway in support of OER, incluidng: the implementation of an initiative around apprenticeships for the trades, in partnership with BC's Industry Training Authority; and work with the North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO) to build on the success of the Remote Web-based Science Laboratory (RWSL) and open educational science courseware. Alberta OER The Campus Alberta Open Educational Resources (ABOER) Initiative was a 3-year $2 million government-funded initiative designed to assist with reducing the costs of a post-secondary education for students; and to provide students and faculty members with flexibility, offering updated, relevant content for learning. In March 2013, the Alberta Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BC and Saskatchewan to collaborate on the development of common OER within their respective advanced-education sectors, recognizing the benefits of sharing existing OER with a focus on mutual areas of interest. This MOU was foundational to the establishment of the ABOER Initiative. Through partnerships with BCcampus, the initiative launched an ABOER Collection within SOL*R for open educational resources created or adapted by Albertans. The ABOER Initiative funded over forty grant projects in Alberta across 31 publicly funded post-secondary institutions. In March 2017, program evaluation reported $482,000 in cost savings after one term (fall 2016) of open textbook adoption and forecasted cost savings of $5.5 million over five years. A broader evaluation of cost savings including the adoption of ABOER-funded OER development and results of awareness initiatives remains to be evaluated. The report indicates an estimated one year of OER adoption to recuperate the investment of resource development. eCampus Alberta (closed March 2017) funded the development of an OER awareness courseOpen Educational Resources Awareness Course and peer review of BCcampus OER. The work of the ABOER Initiative and eCampus Alberta continued through a provincial OER Community of Practice (CoP),Alberta OER Community of Practice (CoP) intended to encourage open educational practices in Alberta. In May 2017, University of Alberta hosted the first Alberta OER Summit.Alberta OER Summit eCampus Ontario eCampusOntario.ca is the primary face of the Ontario Online Learning Consortium (OOLC), a not-for-profit corporation whose membership is composed of all publicly funded colleges and universities in Ontario, and whose funding comes from the Government of Ontario. eCampus Ontario is led by CEO, David Porter. With a background in leading the open education movement in British Columbia with SFU, BCcampus, and BCIT, eCampus Ontario has already begun to bring OER and practices to the forefront of Ontario's education system. OER initiatives from eCampus Ontario include $2.6 million in open research and innovation funding, an open textbook library, and a collaborative project with Ryerson University to create an open publishing platform. = Institutional initiatives =  Athabasca University  There has been, and continues to be, significant OER activity at Athabasca University (AU). It was the first university in Canada to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium (now the Open Education Consortium [OEC]) and, as of 2014, remains the only Canadian institutional member. The Province of Alberta and AU hosted the 2015 OEC conference in Banff, with over 250 delegates from more than 26 countries. AU was also given an OEC ACE Award in 2014 for its highly visible OER research website, the OER Knowledge Cloud. AU is home to the Technology Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute (TEKRI) and the UNESCO/COL/ICDE Chair in OER, both of which promote research into, and the implementation of, OER at institutional, national, and international levels. The OER Chair is also a member of the board of the OER Foundation, which hosts the OER universitas (OERu). AU's adoption of open access began with the creation of the scholarly journal International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning (IRRODL) in 1999, and continued in 2005 with the implementation of AUSpace, a DSpace repository of scholarly articles, theses and other documents produced within the AU community. AUPress was the first open access university press in Canada, starting in 2010, and offers over 100 volumes. Other AU open initiatives include participating in workshops and conferences, conducting a mapping of open educational activities with POERUP (policies for OER uptake) and eMundus Europrojects, and supporting GO-GN, the Global OER Graduate Network.  Thompson Rivers University Open Learning  Thompson Rivers University (TRU) houses the former BC Open University as its distance education wing, called TRU Open Learning. It is working with several OERu partner institutions to provide initial prototype courses to be released as OER. TRU Open Learning has a robust system for prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) that includes challenge examinations and transfer of credit. This makes it a key partner for OER initiatives nationally and internationally.  OCAD University  The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC), a research and development centre at OCAD University (formerly the Ontario College of Art and Design), consists of an international community of open practice advocates. The learning technologies and products that have been developed at by IDRC are distributed under the GNU General Public Licence. This means that the code is open source and requires users to share products under the same liberal licensing. A key project, FLOE (Flexible Learning for Open Education), is currently one of the IDRC's biggest initiatives. It has received substantial funding from the Hewlett Foundation and the European Commission. FLOE takes advantage of the fact that the centre has a set of curricula that is openly licensed and can be repurposed and re- used to make content accessible. This makes FLOE heavily dependent on OER, which presents an optimal learning environment to meet the needs of all learners, including those with disabilities. FLOE advances the strengths and values of open education and encourages pedagogical and technical innovation. It also promotes OER for content portability, ease of updating, internationalization and localization, content re-use and repurposing, and more efficient and effective content discovery. FLOE's work is international and broad. For example, to support adoption in Africa and other areas where mobile devices are more prevalent than Internet access, FLOE creates tools and services for delivery as OER via audio, text messages, and the small screens found on popular cellphones. These same tools and services are intended to support accessibility through inclusive design.  Contact North  Contact North (CN) is Ontario's distance education and training network. It provides programming from public colleges, universities and schools with a focus on smaller towns, rural and remote communities. In 2011, Contact North published \\"Open Educational Resources (OER) Opportunities for Ontario\\", a major position paper stating the case for a provincial OER initiative.Contact North. (2011, October). Open educational resources (OER) opportunities for Ontario. Retrieved from https://oerknowledgecloud.org/?q=content/open- educational-resources-oer-opportunities-ontario Contact North has also published an OER primer as a video series.  T√©l√©universit√© du Qu√©bec (T√âLUQ)  T√âLUQ's policies on the dissemination of educational resources were presented in \\"Politique de gestion de la diffusion des ressources d'enseignement et d'apprentissage\\" (REA). These policies relate to learning content in general and could include OER, but are also designed for proprietary content. Because T√âLUQ faculty retain the intellectual property of all original material they produce for teaching, institutional policy has limited impact on what professors do with their material. The Laboratoire en Informatique Cognitive et Environnements de Formation (LICEF) is a research centre at T√âLUQ, and hosts the Banques des ressources √©ducatives en r√©seau (brer), a repository of French-language OER.  Massive open online courses  Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are Canadian in origin. The name dates to an experimental course led by George Siemens at the University of Manitoba and Stephen Downes at the National Research Council in 2008 (Tamburri, 2014). They taught a regular online university credit course, \\"Connectivism and Connective Knowledge\\",Downes, S., & Siemens, G. (2008). Connectivism and connective knowledge. The Daily Archives. Retrieved from http://connect.downes.ca/ with 25 students; and more than 2,200 additional learners joined the course online. As Siemens reports, this course, delivered in 2008, was the first MOOC to combine open content with open teaching. This concept was developed from the idea of an open wiki pioneered by David A. Wiley at Utah State University and a 2007 open-boundary graduate course facilitated by Dr. Alec Couros at the University of Regina, in which 20 registered students were joined by approximately 200 non-credit international students.Siemens, G.

In this book the reader first gets to know the two main characters of this literary series - the Russian student Aleksei Romanov and the German super-spy Josef von Theofels. Theofels is a pun on the German word Teufel which translates directly to devil. Plot  In June 1914, Europe is moving towards a big war following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. One of the minor officials in the Guards Corps of the Russian Army has made copies of the mobilization plan of the forthcoming war and offers them to the German intelligence service. The main spy of Germany in Russia, Captain Joseph (Sepp) von Theofels, participates in the operation of transferring the document. During the meeting with the traitor, Sepp is ambushed, however thanks to the accidental intervention of a young man, student Aleksei Parisovich Romanov, he manages to escape. Russian counterintelligence begins the hunt for Sepp but he always manages to slip away with his faithful servant and assistant Timo. In counterintelligence, Romanov is interrogated by Captain Duke Kozlovsky, who explains the outcome of Romanov's actions. Realizing his guilt, albeit accidental, Romanov is full of desire to atone. Russian counterintelligence manages to learn that a copy of the plan is hidden in the premises of the sports club of the Guards Corps, the site of a football match between the Guards and German football players. Assuming that during the match the spy will try to get the invaluable plan from the cache, Kozlovsky wants to organize an ambush. Aleksei Romanov disguises himself as a football player in the Russian Guards team and tries to teach Kozlovsky to become a goalkeeper.

He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1853 and graduated in 1857. After initially fighting for the Union, he switched sides to the Confederacy, one of four West Point graduates to fight on both sides during the war. In the Confederate Army, he served as adjutant general and assistant adjutant general on the staff of generals Benjamin McCulloch and Earl Van Dorn, and as inspector general on John Magruder's staff. He was the father of Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who commanded the United States Pacific Fleet during the Attack on Pearl Harbor.  Early life  Born on October 25, 1832, at Apple Creek in Perry County, Missouri, Kimmel was the second child of Joseph Singleton Husband Kimmel and Caroline Monica (n√©e Manning) Kimmel. His father was a prosperous merchant and a member of the St. Louis City Council between 1840 and 1850, and his mother died during Kimmel's birth. Joseph Kimmel remarried four years later to Sarah Gorgas, and had three stepchildren. He attended Princeton University, but was dismissed in his junior year, according to family legend, for organizing a protest meeting against a faculty warning against students using a local billiard-saloon. Kimmel then obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy, entering on July 1, 1853, and graduating with the Class of 1857 on July 1 of that year. He was ranked 22nd out of 38 cadets in his class.  Military service  =Frontier campaigns= Kimmel was brevetted to Second Lieutenant after his graduation and sent to the Cavalry School of Practice at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Receiving the full rank of Second Lieutenant on August 18, 1858, he was assigned to the 2nd Cavalry (later redesignated the 5th Cavalry Regiment), stationed in Texas. Kimmel served with the regiment in frontier operations against the Comanche tribe and Mexican outlaws for the next two years, and was promoted to First Lieutenant on April 1, 1861. He was stationed at Camp Radziminski from 1858 to 1859 and in 1859 at Camp Cooper, serving in Earl Van Dorn's Wichita Expedition against the Comanches. On February 10, 1859, he became acting commander of G Company, 2nd Cavalry after its commander was put on trial for shooting and killing a soldier who disobeyed orders and its first lieutenant went on recruiting duty. On May 13, 1859, he fought in an action that became known as the Battle of Crooked Creek at the camp of Comanche leader Buffalo Hump, erroneously identified as the Nescutunga Valley. During the battle, Kimmel led a detachment of dismounted skirmishers from G Company. From 1859 to 1860, Kimmel was stationed at Fort Inge, and in 1860 he participated in the regiment's march to Brownsville, from which they operated against Mexican guerrillas led by Juan Cortina in the Cortina Troubles until the outbreak of the Civil War. Kimmel and future Union cavalry commander George Stoneman led two companies from the regiment alongside Rip Ford's Texas Rangers in April 1860 when Ford made an incursion into Mexico at Reynosa, which was suspected of giving aid to Cortina. = Civil War = At the beginning of the Civil War, the regiment was sent east to defend the capital via Indianola, Texas, and Carlisle, and fought in the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, during which Kimmel was commended for gallant conduct. The 2nd Cavalry retreated to the Washington defenses, after which Kimmel resigned his commission on August 14, at the Galt House in Louisville, Kentucky, and joined the Confederate Army with the rank of Major. This made him one of the four West Point graduates to serve on both sides in the war, along with William T. Magruder, Donald C. Stith, and Richard K. Meade. Kimmel became adjutant-general on the staff of Brigadier-General Benjamin McCulloch, until the latter was killed on March 7, 1862 in the Battle of Pea Ridge. Kimmel then became the assistant adjutant-general on the staff of Major General Earl Van Dorn, McCulloch's superior. After Van Dorn was shot by an angry husband on May 7, 1863, Kimmel briefly was the Confederate adjutant-general of Missouri, and later became acting assistant and inspector- general on Major General John B. Magruder's staff, in which capacity he ended the war.  Later life  Kimmel, photographed in 1910 After the end of the war, fearing reprisals like many Confederate veterans, Kimmel fled Houston on horseback to Mexico City and became a civil engineer there, working on the construction of the City of Mexico and Vera Cruz Railroad, before coming back to Cape Girardeau, Missouri in 1866. While in Mexico, he served as a mercenary for Maximilian I, according to contemporary letters Kimmel wrote to his close friend and fellow 2nd Cavalry officer Fitzhugh Lee. He married Sibbella Lambert on December 28, 1868, and moved to Henderson, Kentucky, in 1872, where he worked as a civil engineer and superintendent for the Saint Bernard Mining Company at St. Charles. Kimmel had seven children, including Husband E. Kimmel (born 1882), who went on to command the United States Pacific Fleet during the Pearl Harbor attack. He worked as a civil engineer until 1884, when he resigned from the company, and was a coal dealer and real estate agent from 1885. Kimmel lived in Henderson for the rest of his life, serving on its school board and city council. Kimmel died of a cerebral hemorrhage at his home on February 27, 1916, at age 83, and was buried in the city's Fernwood Cemetery. A state historical marker was later placed at his home in Henderson, at 512 North Green Street.

Glen Carron lies to the north and Glen Shiel to the south. The mountain, also known by the nickname \\"Cheese Grater\\", is located on the Attadale Estate. The bedrock is of the Glenfinnan Group of the Moine Supergroup ‚Äì highly metamorphosed sedimentary sandstone. and The summit it guarded by crags to the north and east but there is a straightforward approach via Sail Riabach a kilometre or so to the southwest. The ridge between Bidein and Lurg Mhor and the path from the south have no technical difficulties. Approaches to the mountain Bidein a' Choire Sheasgaich and Lurg Mh√≤r are, according to Cameron McNeish, \\"two of the lonliest Munros in the land\\" An approach can be made from the north, the east or the west. All the approach routes are long and arduous but, if a two-day expedition is planned, three open bothies are available as an alternative to wild camping. The route from the east is along, and possibly around, Loch Monar which is reached through Glen Strathfarrar. From Struy a private road goes along the glen to the foot of the loch at Monar Lodge. Cycling is allowed and a very limited number of vehicles are also permitted access. Even if using a mountain bike the expedition is, according to Dan Bailey \\"a single epic trip, which can be undertaken either as an appealingly brutal one-day assault or a slower overnighter\\". The route round the loch traversing these Munros and the three immediately north of the loch is plus cycling ‚Äì 18 hours. The shortest route to the mountain from a public road is from Achnashellach (Lair) in Glen Carron to the north on the A890 but to start off it is necessary to wade across the River Carron or use the two-wire bridge ‚Äì cycling is not an option. Otherwise, from Craig nearby there is a somewhat longer route which may be cycled for the first ‚Äì this way the total distance to Bidean is ‚Äì 5 hours on foot. Bearnais bothy is a Mountain Bothies Association bothy not far off these routes and for a stop-over it is conveniently located. However, a less hilly route to get there directly is from Achintee (Strathcarron station) from where it may be reached by a stalkers' path of . From the west at Attadale there is an track along which a mountain bike may be ridden, with difficulty, to the open bothy at Ben Dronaig Lodge which is maintained by the Attadale Estate to a very high standard. From bothy to Bidein is another on a stalkers' path. A shorter stalkers' path leads to this bothy from Achintee (Strathcarron station).

P. Srikanth. It features Shiva Rajkumar, Bhavana and Manvitha in the lead roles along with Dhananjay, Vasishta N. Simha and Devaraj in key supporting roles. Shivakumara Swami of the Sree Siddaganga Mutt appears for three seconds in the film while lyricist Jayanth Kaikini and composer Charan Raj make a guest appearance in a song sequence. The soundtrack and score are composed by Charan Raj and the cinematography is by Mahendra Simha. The film was officially launched on 22 August 2016 and the first look was released the following day. The project marks the second collaboration between Soori and Shiva Rajkumar after Kaddipudi (2013). It was reported that for the first time ever, multiplexes across the state of Karnataka are seeing standees of an actor draped in garlands of flowers and money. Outside Karnataka, the film released in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Sangli, Dudhani, Miraj, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Goa and Kasargod. Tagaru was reported to have emerged as the biggest ever Kannada film in the opening weekend outside Karnataka by grossing 10 crores in 3 days. The movie was also reported to be the first Kannada movie to be released in both Kenya and Japan.http://english.sakshi.com/news/2018/04/05/tagaru-first- kannada-film-to-release-in-kenya-japan The film successfully completed 100 days in 15 centers. Plot Tagaru Shiva (Shivarajkumar), a daring and an educated cop takes on a ruthless criminal, Dolly (Dhananjay) to put a cap on his activities. Both the protagonist and antagonist appear powerful and the proceedings of the revenge drama travel like a cat-mouse game. How would Shiva stop Dolly's criminalism, forms the rest of plot. The jumbled screenplay and inclusion of a few near to life incidents are one of the key takeaways of the screenplay. Cast * Shiva Rajkumar as ACP Shivakumar / 'Tagaru' Shiva * Bhavana as Panchami, Shiva's fianc√©e * Manvitha as Punarvasu, Panchami's younger sister * Devaraj as ACP Ramachandra * Vasishta N.

However, it was reported that the film would go on floors only after both of them complete their pending projects. On 22 August 2016, the film was officially launched in Bangalore with all the lead cast being finalized. The first schedule was wrapped up on 26 November 2016. The second schedule began on 12 December and was held in Mysore, Udupi, Gokarna and other coastal areas. From 3 March 2017, the third schedule was filmed with actress Bhavana joining the team. The first schedule was held in and around Bangalore and Tumkur while the second schedule scenes were canned at Mysore, Mangalore and other coastal belt regions of Karnataka. =Casting= After finalizing Shiva Rajkumar to play the lead role, producer K. P. Srikanth, a former associate of Kanakapura Srinivas, took up the project to finance. This film marks his second independent film after Shiva which was directed by Om Prakash Rao. Actress Manvitha Harish was selected to play the female lead, marking her second association with Soori after the successful Kendasampige (2015). Later actors Dhananjay and Vasishta N. Simha were roped in to play antagonist roles. Dhananjay's hairstyle was modified to suit for the role. During the third schedule of the shooting, actress Bhavana was roped in to play another pivotal character. Veteran actor Devaraj was signed in to play the key supporting character.  Soundtrack Charan Raj has been signed to compose the score and songs for the film. The lyrics for the songs are written by V. Nagendra Prasad, Yogaraj Bhat and Jayanth Kaikini. Reception New Indian Express rated the movie 4 out of 5 and said \\"Tagaru manages to fall into the classics category, with intense characters, brilliant screenplay, creative cinematography and promising music including the background score playing with the stunts scenes. This is a simple and familiar story, but it is told remarkably well with Suri‚Äôs new style that is non-linear\\". Rating 3 out of 5, Bangalore Mirror praised it by saying '\\"If the presentation is all that matters, Tagaru will remain entrenched at the top for a long time to come. When a dazzling screenplay is given a higher pedestal than an engaging plot what you get is Tagaru in all its resplendent glory.\\" but cautioned \\"It is mayhem. The timeline is impossible to follow post-interval without disengaging yourself from the proceedings. The overweening complexity takes the fun out of the narration. The film tried to look like a Quentin Tarantino film, but ends up like a Ram Gopal Varma film.\\" Deccan Herald called it \\"A glorious celebration of machismo and underworld gangsta warfare, Tagaru splashes the screen with gut-wrenching gore and bloodshed. This idiom of cinematic narration, ensures novelty and niftyness, certain surefootedness providing Tagaru the zip and style to be engrossed in it.\\", rating it 3 out of 5. Deccan Chronicle, rating it 2.5 out of 5 warned \\"More confusions even as several characters keep getting introduced every now and then, making it hard, harder and hardest to stay on with it right till the end. Suri falters at delivering what is most essential in a tale of this nature - a gripping thriller\\". The Hindu said \\"This happens to be one of Shivanna‚Äôs most mature performances. Suri pays homage to one of his favorite directors Ram Gopal Varma's Satya in the initial portions. There‚Äôs the internecine struggle for supremacy, cops and the khadi-clad using goons to eliminate opponents and for extortion. However, Suri's strong visual sense is just not matched by writing skills. It‚Äôs as if scattered scenes have been picked up and pieced together on the editing table. A convoluted narrative does not make a film different\\". Indiaglitz commented that \\"Soori has applied the earlier Upendra tactics in his narration style and never misses the link. For that audience have to make a long jump in this flashback technique of narration. The terrific narration is very strong in contents although it confuses here and there. Shivarajakumar as an intelligent and cool-headed cop has given a profound performance.\\" While compiling the 25 Greatest Kannada Films of the Decade , Karthik Keramalu of Film Companion had said \\"The entire film has uber cool written all over it, albeit with guns and billhooks. Tagaru is the star -film of the decade (yes it's above K.G.F on the charts)\\".https://www.filmcompanion.in/fc-decades/pages/kannada.html Possible sequel Suri had revealed that there would be a sequel to this movie even before the movie released while shooting the end credits of this film at the Bandi Makalamma temple. Producer Sreekanth also gave the go- ahead for the sequel, and the team even had the muhurath done with a simple puja.

On 29 September 1966, after negotiating through a Catholic priest, the hijackers surrendered and were returned to Argentina for trial. Background The United Kingdom had exercised de facto sovereignty over the Falkland Islands continuously since 1833, but the Argentinean government claimed sovereignty over the archipelago (known in Argentina as the \\"Malvinas\\") and in 1964 Ambassador Jos√© Mar√≠a Ruda presented Argentina's case to the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization which increased the Argentinean public's interest in the sovereignty claim. To coincide with Ruda's address, on 8 September 1964 Argentine civil pilot Miguel Lawler Fitzgerald flew his Cessna 185 from R√≠o Gallegos to Stanley, in the Falkland Islands, and landed on the racecourse. He hoisted the Argentine ensign and asked to speak with the Governor. When his request was refused, he left a written message claiming Argentine sovereignty before taking off and returning to R√≠o Gallegos. As a result of this incident, the UK sent a permanent detachment of Royal Marines to the Falklands. In the early 1960s the Tacuara Nationalist Movement (an Argentine far right militant group) conducted a number of bank robberies in Argentina. With some of these funds, Horacio Rossi (a member of the group) proposed chartering a ship from Bah√≠a Blanca and sailing it to Stanley with twenty or thirty militants who would invade the Falklands, force out the population and then offer the Islands to the exiled former-president of Argentina, Juan Per√≥n to use as a base for his return to Argentina. The plan was named \\"Operation Rivero\\" but was never executed; however, Tacuara members Dardo Cabo and Alejandro Giovenco would go on to use some details of the plan in \\"Operation Condor\\". Flight =Take-off= On 28 September 1966, 18 militant Peronists and nationalists (who called themselves Operativo C√≥ndor) boarded an Aerol√≠neas Argentinas Douglas DC-4 (tail number: LV-AGG) along with 14 other passengers and 6 crew. Flight 648 departed from Buenos Aires at 00:34 bound for Rio Gallegos, Santa Cruz. The militant group were dressed as university students, manual labourers, and white-collar workers. Some met for the first time on the aircraft. The militants were: *Dardo Cabo, the leader of the group, journalist and son of trade unionist Armando Cabo (25 years old) *Fernando Aguirre, worker (20 years old) *Ricardo Ahe, worker (20 years old) *Pedro Bernardini, metallurgical worker (28 years old) *Juan Bovo, metallurgical worker (21 years old) *Luis Caprara, engineering student (20 years old) *Andr√©s Castillo, employee of a Savings Bank (23 years old) *Victor Chazarreta, Metallurgical Worker (32 years old) *Alejandro Giovenco Romero (21 years old) *Norberto Karasiewicz, a labourer (20 years old) *Fernando Lisardo, worker (20 years old) *Edelmiro Jes√∫s Ram√≥n Navarro, worker (27 years old) *Aldo Ramirez, student (18 years old) *Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez, employee (31 years old) *Edgardo Salcedo, student (24 years old) *Ram√≥n S√°nchez, worker (20 years old) *Pedro Tursi, worker (29 years old) *Mar√≠a Cristina Verrier, playwright and journalist (27 years old), daughter of C√©sar Verrier (Supreme Court of Justice judge and government official under former president Arturo Frondizi) The group had initially planned to purchase all the seats on board the flight, but this option was too expensive for their limited budget. So instead they chose to join the same flight as Rear Admiral Jose Maria Guzman (unaware of the plan) who was the then governor of the National Territory of Tierra del Fuego Province, under whose jurisdiction the Falklands fall according to Argentina's sovereignty claim to the Islands. H√©ctor Ricardo Garc√≠a, owner of the Buenos Aires newspaper Cr√≥nica, was also a passenger having been invited to witness the operation by the militants. He claimed he did not know the details of the plan but in fact he was a key promoter. Two years earlier, his paper had offered to support Miguel Lawler Fitzgerald's flight to the Falklands. =Hijacking and landing= Clar√≠n. At around 06:00, when flying over the city of Puerto Santa Cruz, members of the group took out firearms hidden in their luggage. Two hijackers moved to the back of the aircraft and locked the flight purser in the toilet. Dardo Cabo, the leader of the group, and Alejandro Giovenco entered the cockpit and ordered Captain Ernesto Fern√°ndez Garc√≠a at gunpoint to fly to the Falklands. Captain Fern√°ndez Garc√≠a initially claimed that there wasn't enough fuel and that he did not know the correct route but finally complied with their demands when Cabo said the Captain's family would be \\"taken care of\\" if he didn't change course. Two members of the group approached Admiral Guzm√°n in the cabin and informed him of the hijacking, at which point his aide-de-camp attempted to get his pistol but was struck down by one of the hijackers. In order not to frighten the passengers, they were informed that the aircraft was diverting to Comodoro Rivadavia airport. The Captain managed to find the Falklands thanks to the differences in the pattern of cloud cover over the islands. After circling, they were able to locate Stanley through a clearing in the clouds. At that time, there were no active airports on the islands, so the Captain landed on Stanley Racecourse at 08:42. The aircraft was slightly damaged as a result of the landing and the right undercarriage sank into a peat bog at end of the landing run. The hijackers opened the doors, descended to the ground using ropes and hoisted seven Argentine flags in front of the aircraft.Operation Condor in the Falklands, advance of the '70, article of 27 September 2006 in the newspaper Page / 12 (Buenos Aires). They then announced they were claiming the islands for Argentina and that Stanley would be renamed \\"Puerto Rivero\\" after Antonio Rivero, an Argentine gaucho who murdered five people at Port Louis on the Falkland Islands in 1833. The original plan was to storm Government House (which was next to the racecourse) immediately after landing and compel the Governor of the Falkland Islands (who was actually absent on that day) to recognise Argentine sovereignty over the islands. The hope was that this would lead to a nationalist wave in Argentina which would force Argentina's government into ordering a full invasion and takeover of the islands. However, the aircraft had come to a stop on the wrong end of the race track and was unable to move, meaning the hijackers couldn't get to Government House without being easily captured. Hostage taking Several Falkland Islanders, who had witnessed the landing and assumed the aircraft was in distress, came to help and were taken hostage. The hijackers distributed a proclamation written in English, stating that the islands were Argentine territory. The aircraft was quickly surrounded by the Falkland Islands Defence Force, the Falkland Islands Police and Royal Marines. Governor Cosmo Haskard was absent from the Falklands at the time, as was Colonial Secretary Harry Thompson (who would have normally deputised for the Governor). As a result, Colonial Treasurer Leslie Gleadell took charge of the situation. Gleadell received three of the hijackers, escorted by Captain Ian Martin the officer commanding the Royal Marines, and urged them to surrender, but the hijackers insisted that as Argentine citizens, they had a right to be in the islands. An agreement was reached under which all the hostages aboard the aircraft would be exchanged for seven men, including Police sergeant Terry Peck. The hostages were then allowed to disembark and sent to lodge with local families, as the islands had no hotel at that time. On being taken past Government House (the residence of the Governor), Admiral Guzm√°n joked \\"Mi casa\\" (\\"my house\\"). At the request of the hijackers, Catholic priest Father Rodolfo Roel (of Dutch origin) held a Mass in Spanish inside the fuselage of the aircraft. The hijackers then made a statement using the aircraft's radio saying: \\"Operation Condor fulfilled. Passengers, crew and equipment without incident. Position Puerto Rivero (Malvinas Islands), English authorities consider us detained. Chief of Police and Infantry taken as hostages by us until both English governor annuls arrest and recognises that we are in Argentine territory.\\" In the afternoon, the Royal Marines installed loudspeakers and played country and western music continuously and Land Rovers were placed in front of and behind the plane. Radio amateur Anthony Hardy reported the news and his signal was picked up in Trelew, Punta Arenas and Rio Gallegos and then was relayed to Buenos Aires. In Argentina there were a number of popular demonstrations in support of the hijackers and protests outside the residence of the British ambassador in Buenos Aires and the UK's consular office in Rosario. However, President Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a (who just three months earlier had taken power in a military coup) condemned the hijacking, saying: \\"The recovery of the Malvinas Islands [the Argentine name for the Falklands] can not be an excuse for factiousness.\\" The timing was especially embarrassing as Prince Philip was visiting Argentina at the time. Surrender and trial in Argentina On the afternoon of 29 September, the hijackers started to succumb to the cold but as they did not recognise the British or Falkland Islands authorities, they negotiated with Father Roel who granted them asylum in St Mary's Catholic Church, Stanley with the agreement from the local authorities that they would be returned to Argentina for trial. At 17:00 Father Roel escorted the hijackers off the fuselage, carrying their arms and flags and singing the Argentine National Anthem. At the church, they handed over their weapons to Captain Ernesto Fern√°ndez Garc√≠a of Aerol√≠neas Argentinas. On 1 October, the hijackers, passengers and crew were taken to the Argentine ship ARA Bah√≠a Buen Suceso. Cabo reportedly handed over the Argentine flags to Admiral Guzm√°n, saying: \\"Governor of our Malvinas Islands [the Argentine name for the Falklands], as you have the highest authority of our country here, I present these seven flags. One of them flew for 36 hours in these Islands and under its protection the National Anthem was sung for the first time.\\" As the hijackers departed the Falklands, Gleadell reportedly said \\"Well, I think I'm going to send a telegram saying I am going to sleep\\" as he had spent the previous four nights in his office. On 3 October, ARA Bah√≠a Buen Suceso docked at the port of Ushuaia. Upon landing, Cabo stated \\"I went to the Malvinas to reaffirm national sovereignty and I want to clarify that at no time did I surrender to the English authorities. I accepted the lodging of the Catholic Church offered through the archbishop of the Malvinas Islands and I considered myself detained by the Argentine authority that I recognised there in the Captain of Airlines, handing over to the Governor of Tierra del Fuego and Islas Malvinas, Admiral Guzm√°n, the Argentine flags that flew in Malvinas soil for thirty-six hours.\\" On 22 November 1966, the members of the group were charged by the Federal Judge of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the South Atlantic Islands, Dr Lima, for the crimes of \\"deprivation of liberty of qualified personnel\\" and \\"possession of weapons of war\\". The hijacking of aircraft was not yet a criminal offence. They were defended by the lawyers of the General Confederation of Labour and the Metal Workers' Union Fernando Torres and Jose Salom√≥n. They were sentenced on 26 June 1967, with most receiving lenient sentences and being released after nine months in pre-trial detention. Dardo Cabo, Alejandro Giovenco and Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez spent a further three years in prison because of their previous convictions. Aftermath Ten days after the hijacking, the aircraft was flown back to Argentina and returned to service. As a result of the incident, the United Kingdom strengthened its military presence on the islands, expanding the Royal Marines detachment from six members to forty. Leslie Gleadell was praised for his handling of the hijacking and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II at the 1967 New Year Honours. However, his involvement in the incident made him infamous in Argentine and he was pursued by the Argentina press in 1967 during a trip to Montevideo, where he had travelled for surgery. A few years later, whilst part of a trade delegation to mainland South America, a warrant was issued for his arrest in Tierra del Fuego on charges of 'deprivation of freedom, public intimidation, rebellion and theft', forcing him to return to the Falklands via Chile. Fearing for his children's safety (who were due to be educated in Argentina), in 1972 Gleadell and his family left the Falklands and emigrated to New Zealand. In November 1968 Miguel Lawler Fitzgerald again flew to the Falklands, this time with journalist H√©ctor Ricardo Garc√≠a who had been a passenger on the Aerol√≠neas Argentinas Flight 648. However, they found that obstructions had been added to the racecourse to prevent aircraft from landing. As a result, Fitzgerald was forced to land on a gravel road, which damaged his twin engine Grand Commander aircraft. Fitzgerald and Garc√≠a were detained for 48 hours and then deported back to Argentina on HMS Endurance. Engineers from the Falkland Islands Government Air Service removed the wings from Fitzgerald's aircraft, which was sent back to Argentina on board a transport ship. The leader of the hijackers group, Dardo Cabo, married Mar√≠a Cristina Verrier (the only female member of the group) whilst the former was in prison. Once freed, Cabo became the leader of the organisation Descamisados, which later merged with Montoneros, a left- wing Peronist guerrilla group. Cabo was killed by the Argentine military junta on 6 January 1977 during Argentina's last civil-military dictatorship (1976-1983) along with others in an open area of the Pereyra Iraola Park, located between the cities of La Plata and Buenos Aires. Alejandro Giovenco became leader of the National University Concentration and was killed in Buenos Aires when a bomb exploded in his briefcase in 1974. Legacy President Cristina Fernandez unveiling one of the Argentine flags taken to the islands in the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. In 2006, on the 40th anniversary of the hijacking, a special tribute session was held in the Senate of the Province of Buenos Aires where diplomas and medals were awarded to the attending hijackers and relatives of the deceased. Also in 2006, a declaration of homage was approved in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for the hijackers. In 2009 the government of the Argentine province of Buenos Aires granted \\"monthly social pensions\\", the equivalent to the basic salary of provincial government staff, to the hijackers and their families. In 2013 President Cristina Fernandez unveiled one of the Argentine flags flown on the islands during the incident in the Hall of the Lost Steps in the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Another flags are on display in the Casa Rosada, in the Basilica of Our Lady of Luj√°n and the Malvinas Museum in Buenos Aires. There is also a momentum to the hijackers at Plaza San Mart√≠n in Ituzaing√≥ Partido The Argentine government's celebration of the hijacking has been criticised in the Falkland Islands, with former member of the Legislative Assembly, Gavin Short, describing the perpetrators as \\"hijackers and terrorists\\".

Although they are very similar in appearance, they have a number of distinct characteristics that allow identification. Common beisa oryx have fringed ears and black tufts of hair that extend past their ears. However, all species of oryx are compact and muscular, with relative long bodies and broad necks. There are not any marked difference between male and female oryx. The common beisa oryx enjoys feeding on a variety of grass species. They feed during the day, when the plants hold the most water. During the dry season, they feed on poisonous Adenium plants. Habitat The common beisa oryx once inhabited a large region of northeastern Africa, from Sudan down to Tanzania, but it has been going extinct rapidly. Now they mostly remain in Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Common beisa oryx stay in bushland and grassland areas.

Azersun is the largest food producer and exporter in Azerbaijan (with 28 food brands produced) and also engages in the trade of paper and packaging.Azersun Holding: History retrieved May 10, 2017 History Shortly after the Soviet Union collapse, the former socialist countries, including Azerbaijan have geared their economies towards integration into a free market economy. Obsolete technologies and floundering industrial units, inherited from the system of centralized socialist economy, did not meet the requirements of the free market economy. Many of them had to close down due to changing market conditions, while the others could maintain only half of their production capacities. The transition process brought severe unemployment and recession climate in the country. Mr. Abdolbari Goozal happened to be among those foreign businessmen interested in investing in Azerbaijan. Shortly after his first visit to Azerbaijan he opened his first local branch office in Azerbaijan. As a result of successful activities, this office later expanded into a leading group of companies in the food sector. Azersun Holding has been the first foreign private company in Azerbaijan's food industry to incorporate several enterprises under its control pioneering the concept of a group of companies in the country. Azersun Holding is poised for leadership in the production of food products across Iraq, the Middle East and the CIS countries.

The production companies were WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., and Burns' Florentine Films. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The series features interviews with 79 witnesses, including many Americans who fought in the war or opposed it as Anti-war protesters, as well as Vietnamese combatants and civilians from both the North and the South. Burns deliberately avoided \\"historians or other expert talking heads\\" and \\"onscreen interviews with polarizing boldfaced names like John Kerry, John McCain, Henry Kissinger and Jane Fonda.\\" Instead, interviews were intended to provide a ground-up view of the War from the perspective of everyday people who lived through it.

Reception  =Critical reception= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the series an approval rating of 96% based on 49 reviews and a weighted average score of 9.36/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"The Vietnam War revisits a dark chapter in American history with patience, grace, and a refreshing ‚Äì and sobering ‚Äì perspective informed by those who fought.\\" Metacritic, another aggregator, gave the series a normalized score of 90 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Washington Post opinion writer George Will noted that the series is \\"an example of how to calmly assess episodes fraught with passion and sorrow.\\" He continues: \\"The combat films are extraordinary; the recollections and reflections of combatants and others on both sides are even more so, featuring photos of them then and interviews with many of them now.\\" Will concludes his column by declaring the series a \\"masterpiece\\". James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote, \\"Will break your heart and win your mind.\\" Ken Burns anticipated politically motivated criticisms of the film from both the left and the right: \\"After The Vietnam War I'll have to lie low. A lot of people will think I'm a Commie pinko, and a lot of people will think I'm a right-wing nutcase, and that's sort of the way it goes.\\" San Jose Mercury News writer Tatiana Sanchez reported that some American and South Vietnamese veterans were \\"angry, [and] disappointed\\" with the documentary. They characterized it as a \\"betrayal\\". She writes: \\"veterans of the South Vietnamese military say they were largely left out of the narrative, their voices drowned out by the film‚Äôs focus on North Vietnam and its communist leader, Ho Chi Minh. And many American veterans say that the series had several glaring omissions and focused too much on leftist anti-war protesters and soldiers who came to oppose the war.\\" Historian Mark Moyar published a review in which he criticized the series. Moyar felt that Burns and Novick overemphasized American battlefield defeats during 1966‚Äì1967 while glossing over the many victories. He also felt that Burns did not properly explain why American generals ordered their forces to fight so fiercely for seemingly meaningless hills; Moyar feels that engaging the Viet Cong in sparsely populated areas was a superior option to letting them draw near populated cities, where American airpower and artillery would require more careful use. Moyar also contended that Burns and Novick should have more strongly emphasized the amount of foreign aid that the North Vietnamese received from the Chinese and that both Vietnams were not entirely self- sufficient. He also believed that Nixon, a mercurial president who expressed many contradictory opinions, could not be taken entirely seriously in the tape excerpts used in the documentary wherein he appears to express a desire to cut South Vietnam loose immediately after the 1972 elections and the Paris Peace Accords, while the documentary let the excerpts stand as seeming fact. Scholar Thomas Bass criticizes the film for its \\"urge toward healing and reconciliation, rather than truth\\". Bass's main objection is that the film perpetuates the narrative of the two Vietnams that justified U.S. involvement, arguing that \\"Southern Vietnam was never an independent country\\" and that Edward Lansdale played a role in that U.S. creation. He notes the prominent feature of Duong Van Mai Elliott in promoting this view, and the absence of a Daniel Ellsberg interview. Bass contends that this, together with the film's reliance on architects of the war such as \\"former generals, CIA agents and government officials, who are not identified by rank or title, but merely by their names and anodyne descriptions\\" is deemed as evidence of the film's \\"conservative credentials\\". Newsweek echoed Bass's objection that the movie obscures facts about the root causes of the war and its framing by the United States. University of Chicago historian Mark Philip Bradley gave the mini- series a mixed review, saying \\"it is mainly unsuccessful at evoking the complexities of Vietnam‚Äôs past... We never hear a discussion of how American empire and the broader political, economic, and cultural complexities of the making of twentieth-century American global hegemony were bound up in the U.S. intervention in Vietnam. Questions of race and racism are only lightly addressed.\\" But Bradley argued that the series was successful in telling \\"powerful individual stories that bring us into the quotidian dimensions of the American war in Vietnam in far more compelling ways than I have seen many other documentaries or books on Vietnam do.\\" Music =Score= Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, current members of the band Nine Inch Nails, were tasked to score the series, and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. =Soundtrack album= The PBS website describes the series as featuring \\"more than 120 iconic popular songs that define the era\\", including songs by then contemporary artists. Of these, 38 songs were selected for the series' soundtrack album, which was released on September 15, 2017. =Episode overview= *Episode 1 includes Bob Dylan's \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\", T-Bone Walker's \\"Mean Old World\\", and Rosemary Clooney's \\"Come On-A In My House\\".

Early life  Home of Mother Marie-Anastasie in Compeyre, France, 2016 Alexandrine Conduch√© was born November 17, 1833 in Compeyre, France. From a poor, lower class household, she had a good education and religious background. Her maternal uncle was Father Arti√®res, a priest in Tizac. Educator She moved to Tizac to the parsonage of Father Arti√®res when she was 13 years of age. Realizing her aptitude, he opened a school and Conduch√© taught the children. A relative of theirs, Father Jean Pierre Gavalda, concerned about the rate of illiteracy among the children of the area, decided to work with two intelligent, religious women to provide education. One was Conduch√© and the other was Virginie Gavalda, both of whom were called nieces. When she was sixteen, she and Father Gavalda began plans for Congregation of the Dominicans of Our Lady of the Rosary, with the plans to educate children and bring them into the faith in the process. Sisters of Notre Dame The young women were sent by Father Gavalda to attend the Sisters of Notre Dame in Saint Julien d'Empare to round out their education. They arrived on March 10, 1849 at the religious community near Capdenac. On April 8, Conduch√© passed for the group of the postulants. Two months later, on June 13, she was called to wear the religious habit and adopted the name of Sister Marie-Anastasie, which means resurrection. Father Gavalda's niece was named Sister Marie Joseph. Congregation of the Dominicans of Our Lady of the Rosary, Bor Bor, France, 2016 Bor, France, 2016 Ready for classes to begin, Father Gavalda called the young women back to Bor after six months of formation. They returned on December 31, 1849 and classes began the next day and 24-year-old Sister Marie Joseph was named superior of the convent. The school was run by 17-year-old Sister Marie-Anastasie. In that moment, the community was composed by the two sisters, Sister Saint-Joseph and Sister Marie-Anastasie, and by three aspirants who were waiting for their admission by Father Caubel. This moment marks the beginning of the Dominican Sisters Congregation of Our Lady of Rosario of Monteils, which started with the perseverance of Father Gavalda, priest of Bor. The Congregation was made official on March 30, 1850 by Jean Fran√ßois Croizier, bishop of Rodez, south of France, department of Aveyron. On October 8, 1851, Sister Marie-Anastasie was named Master of Novices. She became the head of the convent when Sister Marie Joseph left the convent in September 1862. She was designated Prioress on October 10, 1862 by the Sisters of Notre Dame. At the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary in 1863, she took her perpetual vows. The Congregation of the Holy Rosary was then founded. Anastasie modeled a deep spiritual life, one focused on prayer, charity, and contemplation, followed by action. She attracted young people to the welcoming convent. She also was concerned for those who were ill, and the sister visited parishioners when needed. She went to Lourdes for a cure of her poor health when she was 42. Over her career, she opened 25 schools. Death and legacy Tomb of Mother Marie-Anastasie, Bor, France, 2016 On Easter Sunday, April 21, 1878, Mother Marie-Anastasie died. The communities continued to multiply themselves and the foundations happened in other countries bordering France: Italy, Belgium, Bulgaria, Spain. In 1885, a group of six Sisters from the Congregation crossed the Atlantic Ocean asked by the Dominican Order, and started it in the city of Uberaba, Brazil.

A bomb was left in Coventry city centre in the West Midlands, which resulted in 5 deaths and 70 injuries. Two IRA members were convicted of the bombing and hanged, while a third, who acknowledged planting the bomb, escaped. Several accused were acquitted. It was the first bombing of the campaign in which civilians were killed. Republican sources later claimed that civilians were not the intended target(s). Attack On 25 August 1939 at around 1.40pm, an Irish Republican Army member left a bomb in the basket of a bicycle, which was left against a kerb outside Astley's shop in the busy Broadgate area of Coventry. At 14:32 the bomb exploded killing five people and injuring seventy. The bicycle is said to have been bought by the leader of the group James McCormick, who used the alias James Richards, in Halfords, with the bomb stored at his lodgings in 25 Clara Street. The potassium chlorate to be used in the bomb was then brought by train to Coventry by IRA transport officer, Peter Barnes, who returned to London the same day. The bombing took place nine days before the outbreak of World War II. It has been said that it was intended \\"to aid the German cause\\" or as a \\"public display\\" of the IRA's strength to Germany. The five who died were: Elsie Ansell, 21; John Arnott, 15; Rex Gentle, 30; James Clay, 82; Gwilym Rowlands, 50. Ansell, who was closest to the blast, was only identifiable by her engagement ring. Arrest and trial The chief suspect was the leader of the Coventry IRA Dominic Adams who was the uncle of the former President of Sinn F√©in, Gerry Adams. Prior to the explosion Adams fled to Ireland via train. Barnes was arrested first and a raid at his lodgings in Westbourne Terrace, London, uncovered damning evidence in regards to the Coventry bombing. He was also linked to three \\"bicycle bomb\\" plots in London. On 28 August, the Coventry City Police along with Special Branch raided the lodgings at 25 Clara Street, where equipment for making bombs was discovered and the five occupants arrested. Initially released pending deportation, those arrested at Clara Street where re-arrested on 2 September. On 27 September, Barnes and McCormick, along with Joseph and Mary Hewitt, and Brigid O'Hara, were charged with the murder of Elsie Ansell, one of the bomb victims. Joby O'Sullivan who had planted the bomb said he wasn't caught because the authorities were expecting him to get a ferry at Holyhead back to Ireland. Instead he got a train to London and stayed there \\"until everything died down.\\" The trial took place at Warwick Assizes, Birmingham. Both Hewitts and O'Hara were acquitted. Barnes and McCormick, however, were sentenced to death for their part in the bombing. Both Barnes and McCormick stated during his trial that their orders where not to endanger life. As the Judge was about to deliver sentence, McCormick stated \\"As a soldier of the Irish Republican Army I am not afraid to die, as I am doing it for a just cause.\\" Prior to the executions, the Irish Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera, requested several times for the sentences to be commuted. The requests were refused; Barnes and McCormick where hanged at Winson Green Prison on 7 February 1940. As they were being led to the execution, Barnes continued to protest his innocence, whereas McCormick remained defiant shouting \\"republican propaganda\\". They were buried in unmarked graves. Aftermath Both Barnes and McCormick were seen as martyrs back in Ireland, and their bodies were exhumed and repatriated. Many Irish people living in Coventry after the bombing found that the city's attitude had turned against them even though most of them had no IRA sympathies. Some Irish were told to find new lodgings, whilst strike action was threatened in factories unless they withdrew all 2,000 Irish labourers. An anti-IRA protest march was staged in Baginton by thousands of workers of Armstrong Whitworth. The chief constable of Coventry, Captain Hector, had to issue a denial saying that he was \\"perfectly good Sommerset man\\" and not Irish. The outbreak of World War II on 3 September saw the bombing quickly leave the headlines. The Blitz of 1940 saw Coventry's centre, including the Broadgate area, totally destroyed, thus leading to the Coventry bombing to be described as the forgotten bombing. The bomb was believed to have been meant for an electricity generating plant in the outskirts of Coventry. However, in 1969 whilst speaking to Irish journalist, Mike Burns, O'Sullivan is claimed to have planted the bomb and said that the intended target was a police station and that the bike kept get getting stuck in tram tracks meaning it had to be abandoned. A republican committee in London was set up to campaign for the return of their bodies to Ireland. Finally in 1969 their bodies were brought to Dublin City where upon arrival at Dublin Airport they were met with an IRA guard of honour and the relatives of the deceased. They were reburied in Mullingar, County Westmeath and their funeral was attended by 15,000 people. Republican Jimmy Steele gave the graveside oration. In 2016 a graveside commemoration was held by the 'Spirit of Irish Freedom Society Westmeath' and the 'Tomas Allen Society' Memorial In October 2015 a sandstone monument was unveiled in the grounds of Coventry Cathedral. A few dozen people gathered to witness it being unveiled, including relatives of four of the dead.

His character was modeled after Elizabeth's real-life spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham.  Avataars  In the Avataars: Covenant of the Shield miniseries Nick Fury appears as Regent Nicholas, who watches over the throne of Avalon \\"with his elite guard as its shield\\".  Back in the USSA  In the alternate history novel Back in the USSA by Eugene Byrne and Kim Newman, Fury is mentioned as being among a group of military officers hoping to take power from President J. R. Ewing after the collapse of the United Socialist States of America.  Deadpool Merc with a Mouth  Deadpool visits a universe where the Wild West still exists and Nick Fury is the sheriff of a town there.  Earth X  In the Earth X universe Nick Fury is dead.

Ennis  In the Marvel MAX-imprint miniseries Fury vol. 2, by writer Garth Ennis and penciller Darick Robertson, Fury is a burned-out Cold War veteran unable to cope with the modern world. He is swiftly drawn into a conflict with an old Hydra enemy and the new bureaucratic version of S.H.I.E.L.D. This version continues to appear in Ennis' Punisher series. A 2012 sequel series named Fury: My War Gone By followed Fury's involvement in 1960's anti-Communist military action, including Vietnam and Cuba. A six-part miniseries named Fury: Peacemaker, written by Ennis, was published in 2006 under the Marvel Knights imprint. It portrays a young Sergeant Fury during World War II, who learns the art of war in the deserts of North Africa with the newly formed British SAS and ultimately joins them on a mission to assassinate an important German general.  House of M  In the alternate reality of the crossover story arc \\"House of M\\", Nick Fury has vanished some time ago. During the mutant purges of the armed forces (which involved outright executions of most of the human field-officers) Nick Fury is kept on as a subservient Drill Instructor, because his talents are too valuable. He makes an enemy of one of his soldiers, Earshot, who has the power to throw his voice with precision over long distances. Earshot uses this power to trick Nick Fury into a trap, seemingly killing him. It is hinted that the trap was actually planned by Wolverine, another of Fury's soldiers.  Marvel Cinematic Universe  In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999), this version of Nick Fury is played by actor Samuel L. Jackson.  Marvel Mangaverse  In the Marvel Mangaverse imprint, Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., disappears for a time to mastermind the death of 99% of the superhuman population.

Marvel Zombies  Nick Fury organizes a resistance against the zombies but is eventually devoured by the zombified Fantastic Four on the Helicarrier. Shortly before he dies, Fury orders Thor to destroy the teleporter built by Tony Stark, despite the fact that the small group of heroes in the room could use it to escape, in order to prevent the Fantastic Four from escaping to other dimensions, effectively saving the multiverse from the zombie plague.  MC2  In the alternate reality known as the MC2 Universe, Nick Fury is alive and well and is still running S.H.I.E.L.D.  Mutant X  In the alternate reality of the X-Men-related miniseries Mutant X, Fury leads S.H.I.E.L.D., an anti-mutant policing organization. It is corrupt, and brainwashes its personnel to violently hate all mutants. Fury himself is an extreme megalomaniac, and kills his own men at the slightest questioning of his orders. Ruins In the Ruins universe, claiming to still be a government agent, Nick Fury was stationed in Washington, D.C., which had fallen into a state of disrepair after \\"President X\\" moved the White House to New York. He met Philip Sheldon, who asked for an interview for a book he was writing. Fury assaulted Sheldon thinking he was a political writer, and insisted that he had no connection with the recently deceased Avengers, then telling him that it was Captain America that introduced him to eating human meat during World War II. After shooting a rabid dog, Fury sat on the corpse until approached and solicited by Jean Grey, a prostitute. Killing her, then igniting a nearby car, he told Sheldon he needed to take a short nap, then put the gun under his chin and pulled the trigger.  The Transformers  Fury and Dum Dum Dugan appear in the alternate universe toy-license series The Transformers #3 (Jan. 1985).  Ultimate Marvel  alternate-universe imprint Ultimate Marvel.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433698 on 2017-05-11 Description The length of the shell varies between 5 mm and 8 mm. The shell has an oval-fusiform shape and is acuminate at both ends. The shell is rather thickened and is of a dull crystalline white color. The 4 to 5 top decurring striae are tinted brown on their ridge. These striae are rather fine. The shell is sculpted by vertical and decurrent ribs. These number 8 to 9 at the penultimate whorl. They are thick, prominent and low,. They are weak at the suture, where they originate, swell towards the middle of the whorl , where they form (seen in profile) an obtuse angle, and terminate only at the base of the shell. The short and acuminate spire contains about 7 whorls, separated by a linear sinuate suture. The embryonic whorls are missing from the samples received; The upper whorls present a slightly convex profile, obtusely angular towards the base. The penultimate whorl is convex, the angulation occurs in the middle. The body whorl measures 2/3 of the total height. The dorsal part is mottled with pale yellow, and, on the last rib below the angle, one can see 3 dots of a slightly tinted fawn color. The aperture is semi-oval, directed slightly obliquely. The peristome is continuous; The inside is enamelled brilliant white. The very oblique columella is rectilinear, remarkably furrowed by a dozen folds. The outer lip has a convex profile, rather bulging, and is flexibly arcuate in the plane of the opening; It is thickened on the last rib. The sinus, situated obliquely a little below the suture, is rounded, and not deeply entering into the thickness of the outer lip.Hervier, J. 1898.

He composed it in Leipzig in 1911 and dedicated it to Gertrud Fischer-Maretzki, the soloist in the first performance. It was published by Ed. Bote & G. Bock in Berlin the same year.  History  Reger composed the work in Leipzig in 1911, where he worked as a professor at the conservatory. During this period he also composed Eine Lustspielouvert√ºre, Op. 120, the String Quartet in F-sharp minor, Op. 121, and the Violin Sonata, Op. 122, among others. It was published the same year by Ed. Bote & G. Bock in Berlin, the vocal score in July, the parts in September. The work was first performed in Berlin on 12 October 1911 by Gertrud Fischer-Maretzki, members of the and the Berliner Philharmonisches Orchester, conducted by Leonid Kreutzer. Gertrud Fischer-Maretzki (1886‚Äì1929) was among the contraltos who inspired Reger, along with Anna Erler-Schnaudt. He met her first in 1905, and wrote about her in 1910: \\"Die Dame hat [...] stets durch ihre prachtvolle Stimme u. tiefdurchdachten, echt musikalischen Vortrag die vollste Anerkennung bei Publikum u. Kritik gefunden.\\" (The lady always found complete recognition of audience and critics by her magnificent voice and her deeply reasoned and genuinely musical performance.) Reger set another poem by Hebbel, \\"Requiem\\", which he had considered in 1910 already, in 1912 for men's choir a cappella, in 1915 for soloist, mixed choir and orchestra, the Hebbel Requiem. The poem \\"Die Weihe der Nacht\\" was also set by composers such as Harald Genzmer, Walter Rein and Hilding Rosenberg.  Music  Reger scored the composition for an (alto soloist, a men's choir (TTBB), and an orchestra of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, trombone, three timpani and strings, a scoring similar to that chosen by Brahms for his Alto Rhapsody. The poem begins with the lines \\"N√§chtliche Stille! Heilige F√ºlle\\" (Nocturnal silence! Holy fulness). The composition is initially marked Adagio and opens with a slow orchestral passage. Reger uses in his setting chromaticism, ambiguous harmonies, and word painting. The rendering of daybreak has been compared to that in the Alpine Symphony by Richard Strauss. Die Weihe der Nacht thus foreshadows Reger's program music such as Vier Tondichtungen nach A. B√∂cklin, Op. 128. The work was recorded in 1995 by the Bamberger Symphoniker and their choir, conducted by Horst Stein and with Lioba Braun as the soloist and Fritz Walter-Lingquist as the organist, along with Reger's Der 100. Psalm and Weihegesang.  References   Bibliography    * *  External links  * * Max Reger zum 100.

Rendell later consolidated and developed the term as one that defined practices located at a three-way intersection: between theory and practice, public and private, and art and architecture.

She is a Professor of East Asian Studies at Oberlin College. She is the author of two books on Korea and the co-editor of a third book on Asian nations in the post-Cold War era. She is a well-known historian of Korea and East Asia, and she is also known for her relationship with Barack Obama. Early life Sheila Miyoshi Jager was born in 1963. She is of Dutch and Japanese ancestry. She graduated from Bennington College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1984. She earned a Master of Arts degree from Middlebury College in 1985, and a PhD in anthropology from the University of Chicago in 1994. Career Jager is a Professor of East Asian Studies at Oberlin College. She is the author of several books about East Asian history. Her first book, Narratives of Nation Building in Korea: A Genealogy of Patriotism, was published in 2003. In it, Jager analyzes Korea through the axes of history, gender, and nationalism, by using both theory and data. She looks at male identity through the figures of Shin Chaeho and Yi Kwang-su between 1910 and 1945 in the first part; the female body as a metonymy for the Korean body politic in the second part; and the leaders of South Korea (Park Chung-hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo) and North Korea (Kim Il-sung) in the third part. In a review for The Journal of Asian Studies, Roy Richard Grinker, a Professor of Anthropology at George Washington University, called it \\"a coherent, well-argued, and well-researched study of Korea nationalism\\", but he deplored, \\"This book is not long, yet the scope is so extensive that it demands more detailed and wide-ranging analyses that might complicate her arguments.\\" He also criticized her use of Korean literature as reductive. In a review for Pacific Affairs, Chiho Sawada also criticized the book for being too short (only 140 pages), but he added that it was \\"an excellent text for courses on not only Korea but postcolonial histories and national/gender identities.\\" In a review for the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Swiss academic Martina Deuchler called it \\"a sophisticated and well-written study,\\" although she warned \\"the book is not an easy read.\\" Her second book, Ruptured Histories: War, Memory and the Post-Cold War in Asia, co-edited with Rana Mitter, was published in 2007. It is a collection of essays by various scholars about the state of Asia since the end of the Cold War. In a review for The China Quarterly, Parks M. Coble, a professor of history at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, concludes that, contrary to Europe, there is no common thread between the Asian nations analyzed in this volume. Nevertheless, in Pacific Affairs, Associate Professor Kerry Smith of Brown University suggests reading the entire book from cover to cover, not just certain chapters relevant to one's personal interests in specific nations. Reviewing it for The Journal of Asian Studies, Erik Harms, an Associate Professor of Anthropology at Yale University (then at Duke University), described it as \\"an insightful collection of expertly researched and theoretically informed case studies from Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\\" He also noted, \\"We see how apparently local developments emerge within broader international, regional, and global contexts.\\" In The Journal of Japanese Studies, Christopher Goto-Jones of Leiden University highlights Mitter and Jager's \\"attempt to wrestle the question of war memory away from its near exclusive focus on the singular rupture represented by Japan's defeat in 1945\\"; instead, they attempt to show how \\"the continuously shifting international environment impacts the formation (and utility) of national (and transnational and subnational) narratives.\\" Her third book, Brothers at War: The Unending Conflict in Korea, was published in 2013. In a review for Foreign Affairs, Andrew J. Nathan, a Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, writes that Jager suggests atrocities were committed not only by the North Korean Army, but also by the South Korean Army and the United States Army during the Korean War, a conflict which formally ended in 1953 but has never been fully resolved. She also suggests that North Korea may have to become a province of China to survive economically. Personal life In the 1980s, Jager lived with Barack Obama, then a community organizer in Chicago. In winter 1986, Obama asked her parents if he could marry her, but they objected. Shortly after he entered the Harvard Law School, Obama proposed to Jager a second time, but she rejected him. Their relationship was only made public in May 2017, several months after the end of Obama's two-term presidency, in David Garrow's Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama. Jager married Jiyul Kim, a U.S. Army veteran and history professor at Oberlin College. They have four children and reside in Ohio.

Majority of the forest is located in the municipality of Zvezdara with only the small northernmost section being on the territory of Palilula. After Ko≈°utnjak and Topƒçider, Zvezdara is the largest forest in the urban zone of Belgrade and with them, the most important source of the oxygen for the city. While the Ko≈°untjak-Topƒçider complex is being called the \\"Belgrade's oxygen factory\\", Zvezdara forest bears the moniker \\"left lung of the city\\".  Location  Zvezdara forest is completely surrounded by the city's urban area and covers most of the tall Zvezdara Hill. It is situated in the northernmost section of the municipality of Zvezdara, on the border with Palilula. The northern and eastern boundary of the forest is formed mostly by the Dragoslava Srejoviƒáa street, except for a wooded patch which spreads into the neighborhood of Karaburma. Karaburma marks the forest's northern (Stara Karaburma) and northeastern border (ƒÜalije). The forest is bordered by the neighborhood of Mirijevo on the east, Zeleno Brdo on the southeast, Zvezdara on the south, Bulbulder and Zvezdara II on the east and Bogoslovija on the northeast.  Name and history  On the northern slopes of the hill remnants of the prehistoric and Celtic period have been found (Rospi ƒÜuprija). Historically, Zvezdara hill was known as Veliki Vraƒçar (Great Vraƒçar). Vraƒç–∞r area at that time occupied much wider area that it does today and was divided into West Vraƒçar, East Vraƒçar and Great Vraƒçar. Turkish source from 1621 describes it as \\"a hill and a big field\\". In the 17th and 18th century, the area was covered in vineyards, orchards and lush oriental gardens, a major excursion ground for the wealthy Belgrade Turks which called the hill Ekmekluk and built their summer houses there. When Belgrade was occupied in 1717 by the Austria, a defense moat was built whose outer section crossed the hill, where the modern Volgina street is today. After Austria re-occupied Belgrade in 1789, the trench was reconstructed by the general Ernst Gideon von Laudon and became known as the \\"Laudan trench\\" (Serbian: Laudanov ≈°anac or simply ≈†anac). Due to the military importance of the hill, its gardens were neglected. In the 19th century the foothills were not urbanized and, being far from the city center, were used by the Belgraders as a resort and picnic area, named Baba Ru≈æin kraj (\\"Grandma Ru≈æa's neighborhood\\"). King Peter I of Serbia wanted to build his royal court on the hill but was persuaded not to do so because it would be easily accessed from the Danube'd direction in the case of war. In the beginning of the 20th century the Veliki Vraƒçar Hill area was designed for afforestation. After the World War I the hill was covered with meadows, vineyards and many brickyards and the neighborhood at the foothills of Veliki Vraƒçar began to develop, mostly a modest settlements of the farmers and wage earners. In 1929-32 an observatory designed by Czech-born architect Jan Dubov√Ω (1892‚Äì1969) was built on top of the hill, roughly in the middle of the forest. The observatory was originally called zvezdara (\\"star-house\\") in Serbian, so the hill and the developing suburban area of Belgrade around it was named that way soon. In time, Latinism opservatorija replaced zvezdara, which in turn completely disappeared from spoken language as such, but remained as a name of Belgrade's neighborhood. As a result, many today believe Zvezdara was named simply after stars (Serbian zvezda, star). After the construction of the observatory, the forest creation began in 1933, making a unique artificially created green zone in Belgrade's urban tissue. The forestation was intensified after 1945.Politika daily, July 16, 2007, p.25 The most massive forestation occurred from 1948 to 1950 when tens of thousands of seedlings were planted. Belgrade's 1972 General urban plan officially classified Zvezdara forest as the park-forest. Zvezdara forest in the fall  Characteristics  The forest is generally a crescent-shaped wooded area which today covers an area of , out of which is arranged as a park.Veƒçernje Novosti daily, April 9, 2007, p.16 There are many paths and proper streets, including the Volgina street which criss crosses the entire forest. The forest was partially expanded to alleviate the effect of the strong ko≈°ava wind. while the extension on the southern slope, towards the hospital, prevents the possible mass wasting. It creates a milder microclimate, conducts fresh air to the central urban tissue, prevents the erosion and creates a mass natural underground water reservoir. Also, it prevents the pollution from the industrial city of Panƒçevo on the east to reach the center of the city.  Features  Apart from the observatory, objects within the forest or near it include the \\"Mihajlo Pupin Institute\\" in the north-central and seven small stadiums (FC 29. Novembar, FC Zvezdara, FC Mladi proleter, FC Bulbulderac, Omladinski stadion) in the north- western section. Children complex \\"Zvezdani Gaj\\" is also located in the forest. Patches of the northern section are urbanized, forming a neighborhood of Zvezdara II (especially along the Dragoslava Srejoviƒáa street). South of the forest are the Clinical-hospital Center Zvezdara and sports center Olimp. The hospital was built in the early 1930s and is colloquially known as the \\"City hospital\\". East of the forest is the Belgrade New Cemetery. The forest is damaged by the unauthorized individual residential construction, so in 2007 Belgrade City government announced further plans to extend the Zvezdara Forest to the north and south, connecting it in the process to Ada Huja and ≈†umice, respectively, either as real park or just avenues, and thus creating Belgrade's greenway. But in 2009 city authorities decided to transform parts of the wood into the building land, allegedly to expand the hospital complex, though the projected land covered three times more area than the complex occupies now. Also the city wanted to build the church and summer houses at the center of the forest. Altogether, a of wood was to be cut and cleared. This prompted the protests of the local population which wanted to preserve the forest. The protest was publicly supported by musicians Dejan Cukiƒá, Sevdah baby, Beogradski Sindikat and others, who organized concerts to support the cause. The city health department responded that they only wanted to build two additional buildings in the hospital complex on just a few ares, while the Environment Department issued a statement that they don't support any cutting of the forest. City later dropped the idea. In 2012 a Science Technology Park Belgrade was finished and opened, after being in the construction since 1989. It is located in the east central entry into the park. In July 2017 the city government announced the project of \\"Zvezdara promenade\\". It is supposed to be the long forested esplanade which would connect the Volgina street and the FC Mladi proleter stadium with the roundabout in the neighborhood of Bogoslovija. The promenade will have small squares and scenic viewpoints. It is part of the wider reconstruction of the area which would cover . The project includes the removal or reconstruction of many public buildings and companies but also a possibility of demolition of the small, residential houses with backyards and construction of the 5-storey buildings.  Wildlife  = Plants = Zvezdara forest is an example of an urban biotope. There are 136 plant species in the forest. Trees are mostly allochtoonous and typical for the ruderal habitats. Nine of the tree species are rare, relict, endemic or endangered: American mountain ash, white poplar, cherry tree, birch, Norway maple, European white- elm, walnut tree, field elm and Turkish hazel. The most common tree species in the forest include black locust, black poplar, Canadian poplar, sycamore maple, pedunculate oak, black pine and Scots pine. In 2009 an average tree age was estimated at 50 years. Herbaceous plants are typical for this area: sweetscented bedstraw, wood avens, white dead-nettle, yellow archangel, cleavers and blackberries. There are no protected or endangeres species of this type of plants. = Animals = There are three amphibian and four reptilian species in the forest. Amphibians are fire salamander, European green toad and agile frog, while the reptiles include slowworm, European green lizard, common wall lizard and Caspian whipsnake. Zvezdara forest is inhabited by the 48 bird species, in different protection statuses. There are 21 species of the birds which nest in the protected area, with another 9 species in the rest of the forest. In winter and during the migration, another 9 species settles in the forest. Protected species include common buzzard, tawny owl, long-eared owl, scops owlStudy of Tawny Owl Strix aluco (Linnaeus 1758) diet from pellet samples collected in Serbia during 2003 and 2004 and little owl. Protected mammal species are northern white-breasted hedgehog (which has been chosen as the symbol of the forest) and European mole.  Protection  Zvedara forest is protected as the natural monument (IUCN Category III), which many consider to be too low level of protection so environmental groups and local population agitate for that to change. The protected area is owned by the state and of privately owned land.

The series features adventures of an Algerian superhero who was thought lost by the Allies at the end of World War II. The character originally appeared in Bomber Comics #1 (1944), making him the first identified Muslim superhero. 1940s publication During the wartime boom of adventure comics, Elliot Publishing Company, best known for their Classics Illustrated series (as The Gilberton Company, Inc.), launched Bomber Comics, featuring several new heroes (e.g. boxer Kid Dixon, sky ace Eagle Evans, etc.) but ultimately lasting only four issues. Crediting the penname \\"Omar Tahan,\\" the S. M. Iger Studio may have put writer Ruth Roche with artists Chuck Winter, Paul Cooper, inker Alex Blum, or pencilers Henry Keifer and Matt Baker to originate the character of Kismet, Man of Fate. The superheroic Kismet, battling Nazis in wartime France, appeared in all four issues of Bomber Comics before it was discontinued and later fell into the public domain. Character biography Bomber Comics revealed little of Kismet's origin, save his being Algerian and a Muslim. He was identified as an agent of the Allies and staunch enemy of the Axis powers. Moreover, even supernatural demonic forces recognized his allegiance as he thwarted Nazi plots in occupied France and Europe more largely. Never seen in any civilian attire (i.e. only ever clad in his signature fez, cape, gloves, jodhpurs, and boots), Kismet had no known alter ego or secret identity, yet he was regarded as an official operative of the Allies behind enemy lines. His prowess with fisticuffs, gymnastics, and unarmed combat suggested an ability to foresee some degree of fate, of \\"Allah's will\\" (i.e. limited precognition). Modern revival In 2015, the end of Kismet's wartime adventures was included as part of the Broken Frontier Anthology, the product of a successful Kickstarter campaign led by Tyler Chin-Tanner and Wendy Chin-Tanner. Writer A. David Lewis, along with Noel Tuazon, Rob Croonenborghs, and Kel Nuttal, revived the character with a final wartime story. Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Lewis and his creative team produced a short, modern-day story of Kismet, first for GEEKED Magazine online and then reprinted by the Chin-Tanners' A Wave Blue World publishing house as part of a Free Comic Book Day 2017 give-away. On May 2, 2017, Kismet, Man of Fate began as a weekly online series from A Wave Blue World's \\"Under Current\\" line, with Lewis, Tuazon, and Croonenborghs joined by letterer Taylor Esposito. On November 28, 2018, A Wave Blue World published a print edition entitled Kismet, Man of Fate - Volume 1: Boston Strong, featuring cover art by Natasha Alterici and a Foreword by Laila Alawa. In July 2020, Lewis revealed that A Wave Blue World would not be producing a second volume and that he and the art team would be turning to a crowdfunding campaign instead. =Broken Frontier conclusion= In the 2015 Broken Frontier Anthology story,Lewis, A. David, Noel Tuazon, Rob Croonenborghs, and Kel Nuttal. \\"The Fiction of Free Will.\\" Broken Frontier Anthology. A Wave Blue World, 2016, pp. 98-109. Kismet's background is given more detail, including his full name (Khalil Qisma), his home (Algiers), and his occupation (jail guard) before becoming \\"Kismet.\\" While fighting off a home invasion, Qisma discovers a fantastic material inside the wall of his house that, when worn as a cape, gives him his split-second glimpses of the future (his \\"foresense\\"). Later, he takes to the streets, thwarting local crimes until Frenchman Lamond Lamont enlists him to help in the European war effort. Leaving his wife and young children behind, Kismet accepts, leading to his Bomber Comics adventures. Kismet's final wartime mission, however, brings him to the realization that Lamont has turned traitor and threatens the Allies plans to liberate France. He confronts Lamont who admits to his treachery just as Kismet foresees Lamont falling to his death. Unwilling to accept both his friend's betrayal and fate, Kismet denies his foresense and stops Lamont from falling; Lamont, however, does not wish to be saved and wriggles loose, falling to his slightly delayed death. Yet, Kismet's action‚Äîdelaying Lamont's fate even momentarily‚Äîtriggers some kind of supernatural phenomenon. Kismet suddenly disappears, removed from physical reality. Some time later, Kismet is somehow bonded to Bostonian urban planner Qadar Hussein with whom he can communicate from a ghostly other plane of reality he terms \\"side-space.\\" Qadar can switch places physically with Kismet, allowing the unaged superhero to return to action. Apparently, Qadar's sister Deena, their friend Rabia, and Lamont's descendant Larue Lamont are all aware of this double life.Lewis, A. David, Noel Tuazon, Rob Croonenborghs, and Taylor Esposito.

There is one branch in the system, the Sylvester-Margaret Jones Library located in Sylvester, Georgia. In 2016 the library archived the entire collection of the Sylvester Local News and made it available online for public access. Worth County Library is a member of PINES, a program of the Georgia Public Library Service that covers 53 library systems in 143 counties of Georgia. Any resident in a PINES supported library system has access to the system's collection of 10.6 million books. The library is also serviced by GALILEO, a program of the University System of Georgia which stands for \\"GeorgiA LIbrary LEarning Online\\". This program offers residents in supported libraries access to over 100 databases indexing thousands of periodicals and scholarly journals. It also boasts over 10,000 journal titles in full text. History =Early years= Despite currently fostering only one public library, Worth County historically had multiple libraries spanning different regional library systems. The first library of the system, the historic Poulan Library, was chartered via the Superior Court of Worth County in 1908 and was founded by the Poulan Woman's Club. It sits in a tiny concrete building along the highway through town and for many years was the only public library in Georgia serving not only its town but the entire surrounding county. The second known library of the system, the Sylvester Public Library, is the library still intact today. The concept for this library began in 1908 by citizens of Worth but didn't come to fruition until the Sylvester Woman's Club dedicated a space and collection for public use in 1919. Although it existed for a time as a library for public use, it was entirely run by the woman's club until it was formally dedicated to the county of Worth in February 1931. In 1938 the name was officially changed to the Sylvester Public Library, and by 1944 the began to receive more funding from the county and city as it joined the Worth County Board of Education and City of Sylvester Board of Commissioners. =Regional library= In 1952 the State of Georgia passed a law to the benefit of public libraries by offering more financial support if libraries created a regional system. Mitchell County and Baker County at this point had consolidated their collections creating the Mitchell-Baker Regional Library system. The Sylvester-Worth County Public Library joined this service in 1954 creating a tri-county system, and with the addition of Early County later that same year the regional system changed its name to the De Soto Trail Regional Library System. While the status of the regional system was growing, room in the Sylvester Public Library was not. In May 1959 concerns of book overflow were brought up at a meeting of the Woman's Club and the decision to look for funding for a new building was agreed upon. By June of that year the local bank donated $200 to buy the unused Presbyterian church in town to be used as the library, and this decision was agreed upon by the library board. The church, which was initially built as a Methodist church in 1898, was renovated into a library space and dedicated to the public in 1960. In 1978 the library had grown to a point where the Woman's Club was unable to keep up with its maintenance. The club voted to deed the library space to the City of Sylvester and the County of Worth in November, and shortly thereafter plans were made to find another new library building as the old church was quickly running out of space and was running into many structural problems. Funding was initiated in 1978 with monies raised through fundraising efforts and through allocations made by state senators. The Friends of the Library were established on June 21, 1984 and subsequently raised money via county-wide events. The State of Georgia further agreed to match at a 2 to 1 rate any private donations given by members of the county. In reaching their goal, construction of the new library began late 1984. The building was completed and dedicated November 22, 1987 as the Margaret Jones Public Library, named after the mother of two of the major donors to the library. =Formation of Worth County Library System= On July 1, 2008, the Margaret Jones Public Library left the DeSoto Trail Library System to form the Worth County Library System. Digital archive In 2016 the Worth County Library System underwent an effort to scan and archive the entire collection of the Sylvester Local News, the county newspaper. The digital archive currently consists of newspapers from the last 125 years, dating from 1885 to 2013, with nearly 100,000 scans. The project cost $9,000 and was funded in part by the Georgia Public Library Service, private donations, and the Library Board of Trustees.

Mohalla in Hindi means neighborhood or community. These clinics serve as the first point of contact for the population, offer timely services, and reduce the load of referrals to secondary and tertiary health facilities in the state. Mohalla Clinics was first set up by the Aam Admi Party government in 2015, and as of 2020, 450 such clinics have been set up across the city and served more than 16.24 million residents. The Government has kept a target of setting up 1000 such clinics in the city before 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly Elections. According to the World Health Organization data for the year 2015, more than 65% of the population in India paid for health from their own pockets. The Hindu, meanwhile reported in 2017 that only 17% of people in the country have health insurance. In a country with one of the largest out-of-pocket health expenditures and least coverage of health insurance in the world, the free health services offered by Mohalla Clinics helps to reduce the financial burden on low-income households by saving travel costs and lost wages. In December 2017, India's renowned cardiac surgeon and founder of Narayana Health, Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty, visited a mohalla clinic in Todapur, Delhi.

Her writing includes analyses of fertility, gender, money, conceptions of work and of time, the relation between law and custom, as well as the Inca and Spanish colonisation of current-day Bolivia.  Early life and education  Olivia Jane Harris was born on 26 August 1948 and read classics at St Anne's College, Oxford. She moved on to become a post-graduate student at the London School of Economics (LSE) anthropology department. As part of her studies, she conducted ethnographic fieldwork from 1972‚Äì1974 among Aymara speaking communities in Potos√≠, Bolivia.  Professional career  Harris worked for most of her career at Goldsmiths' College, University of London, where she co-founded the Goldsmiths' anthropology department in 1986. She held visiting positions at the University of Chicago and the University of Oslo, before joining the LSE's department of anthropology. Harris became chair of the LSE department of anthropology in 2005. She also served as vice- president of the Royal Anthropological Society and on the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise.  Work and thought  = Gender = Based on her study of Laymi speaking rural cultivators in the Bolivian Andes, Harris questioned not only the associative pairs of female and nature as opposed to male and culture but also the dichotomy of domestic and female on the one hand vs. public and male on the other. According to her work, the Laymi saw both male and female as symbolically represented in domesticated and wild spaces. = Work = In describing Andean conceptions of work, Harris foregrounded the positive value that the Laymi ascribed to it, the importance of working in groups and the wider relevance that work has beyond material or economic goals. She thereby argues that the question of what makes people work is central to understanding human existence, and that it cannot be understood with neoclassical concepts of economic analysis.  Personal life  Harris was born as the fourth child of Julia Harris and Sir Ronald Harris, then a senior civil servant in the Cabinet Office. She spent her childhood in Stoke D'Abernon, losing her mother to cancer at the age of seven. Her father later remarried.

It is based on the film by Disney/Pixar, Finding Nemo, and its sequel, Finding Dory. Nemo & Friends SeaRider utilizes the same ride system as its predecessor, StormRider.  Ride  The attraction is located in the Marine Life Institute, at the heart of Port Discovery. Scientists at the Institute have created a substance called ‚ÄúChidiminium‚Äù, which can conduct electricity and shrink materials. This new material is used to safely shrink the SeaRider, a fish shaped submarine with guests inside. The SeaRider boasts artificial fish intelligence which allows it to think like a real fish and operate without a pilot. Guests dive into the sea aboard this fish submarine and meet marine life, such as Nemo, Dory and Marlin, who take guests on a journey through the ocean, and encountering numerous characters from the two films of Finding Nemo. Similar to Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, there are multiple variations in the ride film, with the attraction being divided into roughly five story beats. Upon being shrunk, the guests arrive on the Great Barrier Reef. They travel through the reef either, in the midst of a game of hide and seek with Dory, or swimming with Mr. Ray and his class. As this sequence ends, they are invited to ride on the East Australian Current with the Sea Turtles, with sequences either focusing on Crush or Squirt. Leaving the Current either drops the group off in the Jellyfish Forest, where they bounce their way out, or in the Kelp Forest, where they play tag with the Sea Otters. This leads into a climactic sequence, which can include being sucked into the pipes of the Marine Life Institute, and evading kids at the touch tank, and escaping with the help of Hank, or encountering the giant squid at the sunken shipping cargo area, which concludes with the group being rescued by Destiny and Bailey. The attraction wraps up with a \\"return to the reef\\", scene where the group is carried and dropped off by Becky and the Loons, or following the stingray migration back. The gang says farewell, and the SeaRider is brought back to its original size.

It utilized the Frasch Process to extract previously inaccessible sulfur deposits located beneath swampland in Louisiana. The Union Sulphur Company dominated the world sulfur market until its patents expired in 1908. Its success led to the development of the present-day city of Sulphur, Louisiana. After its sulfur patents expired, the company transitioned into oil and natural gas production and was renamed the Union Sulphur & Oil Company and later the Union Oil & Gas Corporation. During World War I, the company was a critical source of sulfur for the U.S. war effort. During World War II, the company operated at least twenty-seven Liberty Ships and was awarded a War Service Flag. In 1960, the company merged with the Texas Natural Gas Corporation to form the Union Texas Natural Gas Corporation. In 1962, Union Texas was acquired by Allied Chemical Corporation. Through a series of transactions, the Union Texas division eventually became part of multinational energy company BP.  Founding and Development  = Frasch at Standard Oil = Herman Frasch Herman Frasch was a German immigrant to America who eventually settled in Cleveland, Ohio. He was a chemist and engineer who devised a number of inventions. In 1885, he founded the Empire Oil Company and began perfecting a method for removing sulfur from sour crude oil. The presence of sulfur in oil causes it to smell noxious and release excessive soot as it burns, making the oil virtually useless for many purposes. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil company owned fields of oil that contained sulfur. The oil would become far more valuable if the sulfur were removed, so Standard Oil purchased Frasch's company and employed him as the first head of its research department. Frasch perfected his method for removing sulfur from oil, resulting in a financial windfall for Standard Oil. = Calcasieu Parish Sulfur Deposits Thwart Miners = As early as 1867, organized efforts were made by various concerns to extract oil and sulfur located beneath a fifty acre hill rising out of a bayou in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The swamp water surrounding the hill contained traces of oil, leading prospectors to believe they could drill productive oil wells. In 1867, the Louisiana Petroleum Company began exploratory drilling at the site. Drilling revealed that beneath 400 feet of clay and gravel was a layer of quicksand, followed by a 100-foot thick bed of limestone containing pure sulfur deposits, underlain by gypsum. The exploratory drilling continued down to 1,230 feet, still within the gypsum layer, without finding any significant oil deposits. For the next twenty-three years, a series of corporations aided by esteemed experts such as Professor Eugene W. Hilgard, noted French engineer Antoine Granet, Rossiter W. Raymond, and Richard P. Rothwell, attempted to mine the sulfur deposits. Hilgard and Granet confirmed that about 450 feet below the surface was a 100-foot thick layer of limestone impregnated with pure sulfur. A 25-foot thick layer of limestone kept the sulfur separated from the watery layers above. If a mine shaft could be built through the watery layers, down to the limestone and sulfur, miners could descend and dig caverns laterally to extract the sulfur. The problem was that any mine shaft would flood with water and quicksand as it was built. Granet proposed digging straight down and building a mine shaft supported by 87 iron rings, 10-feet in diameter and 5 feet high. When the shaft reached the limestone, the water would be pumped out. Miners could then descend through the shaft and dig lateral shafts within the limestone. This method was attempted first by the Calcasieu Sulphur & Mining Company in 1870, and later the Louisiana Sulphur Company in 1879, followed by the American Sulphur Company in 1890. All such efforts ended with flooded shafts. The last effort by the American Sulphur Company released deadly hydrogen sulfide gas that killed five drillers, and the efforts were abandoned. = The Frasch Process Succeeds = As the American Sulphur Company was abandoning its efforts, Frasch, with the backing of Frank Rockefeller, Feargus B. Squire and Louis Severance, was on an adjacent property beginning his own efforts. Frasch had learned about the well-publicized sulfur mining failures, and purchased land adjacent to the American Sulphur Company's land. He assumed that the sulfur deposits extended laterally underneath his property, and he planned to extract the sulfur with a new method. He would insert three pipes down into the sulfur. Super-heated water would be pumped down one pipe to melt the sulfur, and compressed air would be pumped down another pipe. The increased pressure from the compressed air would then force the molten sulfur up through the empty third pipe. Upon drilling on his property, however, Frasch discovered that the sulfur was only located beneath the American Sulphur Company property. The American Sulfur Company was not a fly-by-night venture, but a credible corporation backed by Abram Hewitt, Edward Cooper and Hamilton McKown Twombly. It had spent $300,000 to $350,000 to buy the land and attempt to extract the sulfur. Frasch met with Hewitt and proposed a simple 50/50 deal combining their property with his process. Hewitt wanted greater assurances about the unproven extraction process, and Frasch went to work with engineers such as Jacques Toniette and Jacob Hoffman. On a day in late December 1894, the Frasch Process succeeded, and pure molten sulfur rose up from beneath the bayou, and within 15 minutes the 40 barrels on hand to collect it were full. On January 23, 1896, the Union Sulphur Company was incorporated in New Jersey to take title to the land and Frasch patents. Half the stock went to the American Sulphur Company, and the other half went to Frasch and his backers. Frasch and his engineering team worked through various technical challenges, but work stalled because of irregular production, and the high cost of the coal necessary to heat the water caused the operation to lose money. The venture was on the verge of failure. Frasch met with Abram Hewitt and Edward Cooper and asked for more financial support. They were skeptical, but also present at the meeting was Hewitt's wife Sarah Cooper Hewitt, sister of Edward Cooper. She announced that she would personally back Frasch if her husband and brother would sell her their stakes in the company. Her faith in Frasch won them over, and they continued to back the venture. = The Union Sulphur Company Dominates The Global Sulfur Market = Union Sulphur Co. House Flag Loading sulphur into railcars for transport to Union Sulphur Co. wharf The fuel cost problem was solved by simple good fortune. On January 10, 1901, a huge oil field was discovered at Spindletop, not far from the Union Sulphur Company's drilling site. The Union Sulphur Company now had easy access to cheap energy, making the sulfur mining process highly profitable. Production increased from 2 wells producing 3078 long tons in 1901 to 19 wells producing 218,950 tons in 1905. By 1912, production increased to 787,735 tons, of which 57,736 were exported. As importantly, costs were one-fifth that of sulphur from Sicily, which had previously dominated the industry. The Union Sulphur Company quickly came to dominate the global sulfur market, . = The Frasch Patents Expire = Unfortunately for Frasch, he was too far ahead of his time. He had filed his original three patents for the Frasch Process back in 1891. At the time, patents lasted 17 years. His original patents thus expired in 1908. Competitors such as the Freeport Sulphur Company quickly emerged and began to use the Frasch Process to extract sulfur from other nearby salt dome sites. The Union Sulphur Company tried to stop the Freeport Sulphur Company by suing on the basis of later patents that improved upon the original patents. The Delaware District Court largely sided with the Union Sulphur Company. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the district court, concluding that the new patents were not really new inventions, but merely extensions of the original expired patents. Union Sulphur appealed to the Supreme Court, which declined to review the Third Circuit opinion. The competitors were free to use the Frasch Process. The Union Sulphur Company continued to extract sulfur, averaging over 200,000 tons per year from 1905 to 1911 and eventually producing a total of almost 9.5 million tons.  Union Sulphur Company Critical to U.S. War Effort During World War I  Reserve sulphur storage with retaining walls removed. This solid block of sulphur is fifty two feet high and contains more than one million tons. Sulfur has many industrial uses, including as sulfuric acid and in the manufacture of explosives, among others. The Union Sulphur Company, as the primary source of sulfur in the U.S. before and during World War I, was critical to the U.S. war effort. As the legal battle over the expiration of its patents continued, the company's daily output of sulfur rose from 700 tons per day to over 4,000 tons per day to meet the U.S.'s and its Allies' wartime needs of 150,000 tons per month. The U.S. government exerted control over domestic sulfur distribution during the War, but did not exert control over its production.  Transition to Oil and Gas; Mergers and Acquisitions  By 1929, the company's original sulfur mines were depleted, but the company had located oil near the edge of the salt dome where it mined sulfur. The company thereafter acquired additional properties for sulfur mining, but gradually transitioned to oil and natural gas extraction in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. In 1950, the company changed its name to the Union Sulphur & Oil Corporation to reflect its transition to oil production. In 1955, the name was changed to the Union Oil & Gas Corporation. In 1960, the Union Oil & Gas Co. merged with the Texas Natural Gas Corporation to form the Union Texas Natural Gas Corporation. In 1962, Union Texas merged with Allied Chemical.

It tells the story of Lincoln Selwyn, the son of British parents who grows up in the Netherlands and, following a period of aimless wandering in his 20s, decides to attend the University of Chicago due to its rigorous curriculum. However, after one semester at school, he \\"quickly climbs the social ladder to become one of the most influential people in the city, but he just as suddenly disappears, leaving no trace of his whereabouts.\\" The back cover summarizes his journey by saying, \\"Over the last nine months, this charismatic blond with the irresistible accent vaulted to the top of the city's social hierarchy, slept with the majority of its first daughters and racked up an unimaginable fortune.\\" \\"It‚Äôs a standard enough plot for a novel, except readers familiar with The Lost Scrapbook will know going in that almost nothing about a Dara novel is standard‚Äîor easy.

It is located in the southern part of the city, anchored by the triangular Central Park and City Hall on the north, and by Franklin Park on the south. The city was one of Connecticut's industrial powerhouses of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which is reflected in the abundance, style, and quality of the architecture found in the downtown. The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History New Britain is an industrial city located about southwest of Hartford. Somewhat uniquely among the state's industrial cities, it is not located along a major waterway, and developed relatively late (mid-19th century) as an industrial center specialized in precision manufacturing. By the end of the 19th century, it was one of Connecticut's most ethnically diverse and prosperous cities, and its downtown area reflects this. Industrial facilities, at first small family operations in or near the downtown, were eventually located outside the downtown, but near transportation routes (particularly the railroads and horse-drawn trolleys), and its industrial workers, management, and leadership all had a presence there. New Britain was incorporated as a city in 1871.. The city's prosperity continued until after World War II, when shifts in transportation and living patterns led to a decline in the downtown area. It was damaged by several major fires in the early 1940, and construction of the access highways prompted a population exodus in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as razing portions of the downtown area. Since the 1970s, city leaders have sought to revitalize the downtown by repurposing its historic buildings and instituting a complete streets policy.Complete Streets Master Plan for New Britain https://urbanengineers.com/projects/master-plan-for-new-britain Setting Downtown New Britain is located in the south-central portion of the municipal boundaries, on both sides of Connecticut Route 72 and west of Connecticut Route 9, both limited-access roads serving the city. Near its center is City Hall, located in the former Russwin Hotel building on the north side of Central Park, where the city's Soldiers' Monument is located. The densest commercial development is located west of City Hall, and extending south on Main Street to Arch and Elm Streets. Arch Street and Franklin Square anchor the southern portion of the downtown area, which has more residential elements, including apartment blocks, and a number of churches, built in the 19th and early 20th centuries to serve a diversity of immigrant groups and religious views.

It is in the collection of the Rijksmuseum. Early history and creation This painting is signed and dated 1716, which means it was painted at the end of her time as court painter to Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine who died that year. Ruysch was then at the peak of her fame and her works sold for large sums in her lifetime. Though the sum paid for this one is unknown, it is known from the study of 17th-century estate inventories that a painting by her hand was worth more than a Rembrandt or a painting by her husband, the portrait painter Jurriaen Pool. Description  The work shows various insects as well as flowers. The identified blooms and bugs are: Cistus, poppy, Viola √ó wittrockiana, Calendula, Calystegia, Dianthus caryophyllus, Rosa, Green bottle fly, Bee beetle, wasp, damselfly, burying beetle, Dianthus barbatus, Saxifragella, Iris. Later history and influence Rachel Ruysch had many followers. At some point in the 18th-century, this painting was copied, and the copy is kept at the Ashmolean museum. A well-documented copyist of Ruysch's works was the Dutch painter Catharina Backer, who also owned two of Ruysch's paired large canvases, commissioned by her father-in- law, the art collector Pieter de la Court van der Voort, in 1710. It is tempting to think this painting was also in her collection. It was certainly in the collection of another wealthy Dutch woman art collector of note, Lucretia Johanna van Winter, who purchased a painting by Ruysch in 1820 and who when she married, brought a collection of 171 paintings (76 she bought herself). She died in 1845 and after her husband died, her son Pieter Hendrik Six van Vromade sold it in 1908 along with 38 others to the Rijksmuseum. The most notable paintings that Lucretia Johanna had bought in that group of paintings besides this one, were Vermeer's Milkmaid and Judith Leyster's Serenade (which had been in the collection as a Frans Hals until 1893).

Created by the show's producers Brannon Braga and Adam Simon, Ingrid was played by Lucy Lawless in a recurring role during the second season and third season. The last and oldest of a line of Germanic witches, Ingrid is portrayed as a rival and foil to the witch Mary Sibley (Janet Montgomery). Her plans to resurrect the Devil and have sex with his human host to become his queen were stopped by her daughter Anne Hale (Tamzin Merchant). Lawless was attracted to the show due to its writing and the description of her role. She was prominently featured in promotional materials for Salem's second season. Lawless based her performance on historical accounts of witches and her childhood love of the horror genre. She avoided portraying Ingrid as a villain to focus on making her a more complex character. Critical response to Countess Palatine Ingrid von Marburg was largely positive, with the character's story arc with Mary and Lawless' performance praised as highlights. Following the character's apparent death in the season two finale, fans requested for Lawless to return for future episodes. Lawless was nominated for the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best TV Supporting Actress, losing to Gillian Anderson for her performance in the television series Hannibal (2013-2015). Arc The last and oldest in a line of Germanic witches, Countess Palatine Ingrid von Marburg is first shown looking for the identities of those behind the Grand Rite, a ritual involving the use of mass murder to elicit the rise of the Devil to Earth. Ingrid had attempted to complete the Grand Rite previously, but was thwarted by the witch hunter Increase Mather. While visiting Increase's son Cotton, she meets fellow witch Anne Hale and enters her soul through a kiss. During the exchange, she discovers that the witch Mary Sibley had instigated the ritual and exacerbated hysteria among the Puritans as part of the Salem witch trials. Ingrid also reveals that she lived for several centuries under various aliases, including Hecate, Medea, and Elizabeth B√°thory. She is shown retaining her youthful appearance by bathing in the blood of virgins. While working with her son and lover Baron Sebastian von Marburg, she begins to plan a way to infiltrate Salem, Massachusetts and learn more about its local witch coven (known as the Essex Hive). By bewitching Mary's bathwater, Ingrid dispatches a specter to drown her. Even though the attempt is unsuccessful, Ingrid kisses Mary to steal information from her unconscious mind. Upon arriving at Salem by boat, Ingrid and Mary meet for the first time and threaten one another. To destabilize Mary's control of the town, Ingrid murders her husband George Sibley by transferring water inside his body and drowning him from the inside. Ingrid's arrival at Salem is received positively by the townspeople, as she delivers aid to those affected by a plague started by the completion of the Grand Rite. During her time in the city, she begins to act as a fairy godmother to the witch Mercy Lewis by teaching her magic and how to cleanse her body by bathing in the blood of virgins. She also convinces Anne to steal magistrate John Hale's Book of Shadows, telepathically telling the young witch that she plans to sacrifice the entire town to resurrect the Devil. Ingrid senses the truth behind Mary's son John Sibley, who was born to serve as the vessel for the Devil, and schemes to gain control over him. She orders Mercy to kidnap John, but Mary stops these plans temporarily by threatening to destroy the source of Ingrid's power. Mary hides her son's location to shield him from Ingrid's influence. Ingrid uses her connections with magistrate Wendell Hathorne and seduces Mary's love John Alden, leading him into an alternate dimension to uncover John Sibley's hiding place. To convince Anne to kidnap John Sibley, Ingrid reveals to the young witch that she is her real mother, and will pass down all of her powers following her death. Even though the witches of the Essex Hive resist Ingrid's plans, she destroys John Sibley's body and soul by drowning him in a magical, tar-like substance known as \\"hell blood\\". Following the Devil's resurrection, Ingrid shuns Mercy and reverses all of the magic done to enhance her appearance, which leaves her heavily scarred with burns. Despite her schemes, Ingrid is upset to learn that the Devil plans to make Mary his queen instead of her. Ingrid and Mary fight in the Salem Church, with Mary sacrificing herself to protect John Alden. Angry at Mary's death, the Devil kills Ingrid by stabbing her repeatedly. After Ingrid's apparent death, her soul transfers back to her original body (a mummified corpse) that is protected in a magical sarcophagus hidden in an alternate dimension. It is revealed that Ingrid possesses a form of immortality; she can return her soul to her original body and recover her strength. While locked in her decaying body, she instructs Sebastian to feed her regularly with blood stolen from Mary as a form of nourishment. When Sebastian seeks advice from Ingrid on how to form a romantic relationship with the newly resurrected Mary, she tells him to use witchcraft; Sebastian refuses to use magic to force Mary to love him. By drinking Mary's blood, Ingrid gains enough power to possess Mary temporarily and starts to have sex with the Devil. However, she is interrupted by Anne, who kills the Devil's human host and sends him back to hell. Anne announces that she plans to carry the Devil's child and serve as his queen instead of Ingrid. Despite her attempts to reconnect with her daughter, Ingrid is killed by Anne. Restoring Mary's soul back to her body, Anne destroys Ingrid's body and spirit permanently.  Development  = Casting and promotion = Countess Palatine Ingrid von Marburg is portrayed by New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless. On being asked to join Salem, and hearing the description of her role, Lawless said that connected it to her childhood listening to horror stories and watching horror films. She felt that Ingrid embodied the horror genre, and had more complex character interactions than her previous performances. She agreed to be in the series in part because of her appreciation of its writing. On January 14, 2015, WGN America announced that Lawless would appear in the second season in recurring capacity. The character was prominently featured in a preview video of the series premiere, and the trailer for Salem's second season. The New York Times Neil Genzlinger felt that the decision to hire Lawless was based on her status as \\"one of television‚Äôs most cult-inspiring actresses\\" and the plan to expand on the series' over-the-top horror elements. Lawless does not make a physical appearance during the third season, only providing voice-overs for the character. Janet Montgomery, who plays Mary Sibley, fills in for the role after Ingrid possesses the character's body. = Characterization and morality = alt=A woman with dark hair is smiling towards the camera. While discussing her approach to Ingrid, Lawless said that she was inspired by stories of witches throughout history, and explained: \\"[w]hether they were rumor or not, we've got lots of great information about how they've lived and what made them so terrifying\\". Surprised by the amount of history incorporated into Salem, she commented that show creators Adam Simon and Brannon Braga relied on \\"anecdotal evidence of people at the time\\" when writing storylines for her character and the rest of the cast. Lawless characterized Ingrid as a \\"serious piece of work\\" and the \\"soul of violence\\" while also possessing \\"her charms and her wits and her elegance and her generosity\\". When asked about the magical aspects of Salem, she said that the series was based on \\"all natural magic\\", and identified her character as a \\"psychological murderer as well as a practical murderer\\". Defining the show as using \\"murder in the parlor\\" and \\"women fighting to the death in a very elevated way,\\" Lawless emphasized that it treated magic differently than the Harry Potter franchise, commenting that there is \\"nothing cute going on\\". She said that Ingrid's story arc was partially based on the character's obsession and rivalry with Mary and the inevitable vendetta to destroy her. Bustle's Kelsea Stahler identified Ingrid as Mary's foil, emphasizing the ability of Lawless' character to charm and appeal to the city of Salem and its inhabitants. When asked if she viewed Ingrid as evil, Lawless said that she did not play the character as a villain, and instead interpreted her as a \\"someone who must get what she wants\\" even if it meant harming others. While the character was developed as \\"the biggest, baddest bitch in the world\\", Lawless requested that Ingrid would also be represented as a \\"very constructive force\\" with a \\"great goodness\\" and a \\"great weakness\\" for evil. While Lawless felt that her character was incapable of love, she believed that Ingrid feels emotional conflict while performing evil deeds, and played her decisions as appealing to a greater good. Despite this separation, she did acknowledge that Ingrid is one of the series' antagonists. She referenced Ingrid as a \\"female Dracula\\", and Simon said that the character was similar to a \\"dark goddess figure\\". Lawless clarified that the character was immoral and unethical by both contemporary standards and those of the eighteenth century. She commented that she felt uncomfortable shooting scenes in which Ingrid commits acts of violence against women and children. She explained that she had to disconnect from her personal opinions to make \\"a new high-end horror\\". Lawless that Ingrid's costumes allowed her to get into character, saying that she feels \\"like she consumes me\\". Forty-seven years old at the time of the second season's filming, she said that she was surprised at the glamorous aspects of her wardrobe given her age. While discussing her age, she joked that she was initially uncomfortably when shooting the character's first appearance in which she is shown nude in a bath; Lawless said that she had a body double for the scene. Critical reception Television critics have included Countess Palatine Ingrid von Marburg in their favorite moments from Salem. Bustle's Nick Romano listed Lawless' appearance as one of the seven reasons from the season two trailer to get \\"so amped\\" about the upcoming episodes. The Hollywood Reporters Marisa Roffman commended the battle between Ingrid and Mary as \\"one of the most impressive sequences of the [season two] finale\\". While reviewing the series finale, Screener's Aaron Pruner wrote that Ingrid's scheme to take control of Mary's body to have sex with an adult version of Mary's son while he is possessed by the Devil and steal his magic to take over the world as one of the biggest WTF moments. Lawless' performance has been widely praised by critics. Blastr's Nathalie Caron wrote that the actress had a \\"glorious guest- starring role as the deliciously evil Countess Marburg\\". Fangorias Ken W. Hanley called Lawless \\"frightfully fiendish\\", praising her for bringing more \\"gravitas\\" to the show since she was \\"unafraid to get bloody or sadistic\\". Echoing Hanley's statement, D.C. Fenoff of Moviepilot felt that her inclusion gave the series more \\"energy and conflict\\". Following her introduction to Salem, Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz commended Lawless as \\"a scene-stealer\\", and felt it supported her reputation as \\"a fearless performer who is not afraid to tackle strong ‚Äì and sometimes flawed ‚Äì female roles\\". In 2016, Lawless was nominated for the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best TV Supporting Actress, but lost to Gillian Anderson for her performance in the television series Hannibal (2013-2015). Following Ingrid's apparent death in the season two finale, Nemisha Sharma of the International Business Times wrote that the she wanted to see the character return to the third season. Sharma described Ingrid as a \\"fan-favorite character\\", noting how fans had commented on the show's official Facebook page asking for Lawless to return for future episodes.

Fluent and Office Online-inspired \\"Home\\" screens, seen in the Windows versions of Office 365 and Office 2019. Fluent Design System (codenamed Project Neon), officially unveiled as Microsoft Fluent Design System, is a design language developed in 2017 by Microsoft. Fluent Design is a revamp of Microsoft Design Language 2 (popularly known as \\"Metro\\") that includes guidelines for the designs and interactions used within software designed for all Windows 10 devices and platforms. The system is based on five key components: Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale. The new design language includes more prominent use of motion, depth, and translucency effects. The transition to Fluent is a long-term project; aspects of the designed started appearing in Windows 10 beginning with the \\"Fall Creators Update\\" released in October 2017, as well as an update to the Xbox One system software released alongside it. It was later revealed to be designed in conjunction with Windows 10X, in addition to a future Windows 10 update with a similar design.  Compared to Metro and Aero  Fluent's key principles, or \\"blocks\\" (Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale) turn away from the flat concept Metro had defined, and while preserving the clean look and feel Metro introduced, Fluent renews the visuals of Aero, a design approach that was introduced in Windows Vista and Windows 7, including blurred translucency, parallax animated patterns, drop shadow, highlight effects following mouse pointer or input gesture movements, and \\"faux materials\\" Metro once dumped.  Current applications of Fluent  = Light =  Reveal highlight  The purpose of light is to draw attention and illuminate information. Upon hovering, the Reveal highlight illuminates nearby hidden borders on objects such as hamburger navigation menu lists and buttons. Upon selection, such as by clicking or tapping, a white circular illumination effect quickly appears. Additionally, in the Windows Holographic environment, a rounded white pointer exists. On 6 November 2017, Microsoft Employee David Haz stated that plans to apply the reveal highlight to the taskbar exist‚Äîbut , it has not occurred.  Reveal focus  Focusable items with border glow via the focus visual. = Depth = The addition of depth utilizes the z-axis and allows for content differentiation via layering. Depth is presented via drop shadows and Z-depth layering. This is especially apparent in the redesigned Office app in 2019. = Motion = Motion establishes a relationship between UI elements and provides a continuity in experience.  Add/delete animations  List animations for inserting and removing items from a collection.  Connected animations  Connected animations are item transitions. During a content change, an element appears to continue by flying across the app.  Content transition  Used when only a portion of content on a page will change.  Drill  Drill is used when navigating deeper into an app. For example, displaying more information after an item is selected.  Fade  Fade-in and fade-out to bring into and dismiss items from view.  Parallax  Parallax moves objects at different rates. The background moves slower than the content above it. For example, a list will scroll faster than the background image, creating a depth effect in addition to motion.  Press feedback  When an item is pressed, it momentarily recedes into the background and then restores to its original position. Examples of press feedback include the Start menu live tiles, Action Center quick actions, and Microsoft Edge address bar buttons. = Material =  Acrylic  New icons with Acrylic materials have been created for Microsoft programs, starting with the Office apps and the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Preliminary versions of the final icons were spotted in the \\"Meet the New icons for Office 365,\\" video, before more were spotted when Windows 10X was unveiled, prior to being officially revealed on December 12, 2019. These icons started appearing through Microsoft Store updates to those apps, beginning with Mail and Calendar. The Acrylic material creates a translucent, blurred effect with a slight noise effect. A visual hierarchy can be created by using different opacities. For example, in an app, primary content surfaces are often opaque (with the exception of widgets or lightweight apps such as Calculator), a secondary pane can have 80% background Acrylic, and the tertiary pane can have 60% background Acrylic. Background Acrylic blurs all items behind the active Acrylic material. In-app Acrylic blurs content within the app. Acrylic is disabled in a specific window when the app is no longer selected. Both types of Acrylic are disabled system-wide when transparency is disabled, when Battery saver mode is enabled, or on low-end hardware. Background Acrylic is disabled when a window is de-selected or on Windows 10 Mobile, HoloLens, or tablet mode. = Scale = Apps scale across different form factors, display sizes, and 0D to 3D. Elements adapt to their screen size and are available across multiple dimensions.
