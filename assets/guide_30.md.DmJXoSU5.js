It connects with the rest of the regional rail network of NRW in D√ºsseldorf, Duisburg, Oberhausen, Wanne-Eickel, Dortmund and Hamm. In addition, it connects in D√ºsseldorf, Duisburg, Oberhausen, Dortmund and Hamm with long-distance services. History  The Rhein-Emscher-Express has been operating since the introduction of the integrated regular interval timetable in North Rhine-Westphalia (called NRW- Takt) in 1998. It first ran from M√∂nchengladbach via Krefeld, Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen and Dortmund to Hamm. The Duisburg‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach section was dropped in exchange for an extension from Duisburg to D√ºsseldorf in the timetable change in December 2002. Since then the Rhein-Emscher-Express has run entirely on the trunk line of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company, which was opened in 1846 and 1847. As of 15 December 2019, in connection with a change to the Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn, a new Regionalbahn service line RB 32, the Rhein-Emscher-Bahn, was added to the timetable, which runs parallel to the RE 3 between Dortmund and Duisburg, serving the stops between Gelsenkirchen and Oberhausen that were formally served by a branch of S-Bahn line S 2, including Essen Zollverein Nord. Route The Rhine-Emscher-Express runs daily every hour over the tracks of three railway lines: *The whole Dortmund‚ÄìHamm railway, which is also used by three other Regional-Express services and long-distance trains, * the whole Duisburg‚ÄìDortmund railway, shared with the Rhein-Emscher- Bahn (RB 32) and partly with the Emscher-Niederrhein-Bahn (RB 35) and S-Bahn line S 2, *The Cologne‚ÄìDuisburg railway between Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf. In this four to six track section, the Rhein- Emscher-Express uses the S-Bahn tracks or the so-called \\"local\\" tracks where they exist, along with the Rhein- Haard-Express (RE 2), the Rhein-Weser-Express (RE 6), the Rhein-Hellweg- Express (RE 11) and the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19). Only the NRW-Express (RE 1) and the Rhein-Express (RE 5) use the long-distance tracks.  Rail services The RE 3 runs hourly every day from D√ºsseldorf to Hamm. It runs parallel with Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn lines over large parts of its route and it has some of the character of a fast S-Bahn service and is perceived by passengers accordingly. RB 32, the Rhein-Emscher-Bahn, runs parallel to the RE 3 between Dortmund and Duisburg each hour, also stopping at Essen Zollverein Nord. The passenger rail transport was operated by DB Regio NRW until 12 December 2009, using class 425 electric multiple units in coupled sets since the introduction of the winter timetable of 2008. Previously the service had been operated with push‚Äìpull trains of five refurbished Silberling carriages or four double-deck carriages with a class 111 electric locomotive. The average speed is only 63 km/h. The reason for this is the frequent stops between Dortmund and Hamm. The current operator of this service and the Maas-Wupper-Express is Eurobahn, a subsidiary of Keolis. Operations are carried out using 4 four-carriage and 14 five-carriage Stadler FLIRT electrical multiple units with a top speed of 160 km/h, rented from Angel Trains. In the period from 13 December 2009 to 11 December 2010 (during RUHR.2010, when Essen was a European Capital of Culture), the RE 3 had an additional stop at Essen-Zollverein Nord (formerly Essen-Katernberg S√ºd) to improve access to the World Heritage Site at the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex. On 7 January 2010, the station was officially renamed Essen-Zollverein Nord, but since the timetable change in December 2010, Rhein-Emscher-Express services again skip the station. Operator  Two North Rhine-Westphalian municipal transport associations, the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (\\"Rhine-Ruhr Transport Association\\", VRR) and the Verkehrsgemeinschaft Ruhr-Lippe (\\"transport community of Westphalia- Lippe\\", ZRL) are involved in the operation of the service. The franchise for operating the service together with the Maas-Wupper-Express from the timetable change on 13 December 2009 was put out to tender. The winner was Rhenus Keolis GmbH, beating Abellio Rail NRW, DB Regio NRW GmbH and other railway companies.

The Schwinge is long. It rises in the Hohes Moor near (a part of Kutenholz) on the Stade Geest in the bifurcation area with the Oste. From there it flows in a largely natural, more than upper reach towards Stade. Because of its very natural river scenery and its biodiversity, the floodplains of the upper reach and the meadows near Stade are protected for landscape conservation. In Stade the ca. 1000-year-old Hanse port (') lies at the Schwinge. Here the upper reach is isolated from tides by a sluice called Salztorschleuse since 1792; the lower reach of the Schwinge, which flows into the lower Elbe north-eastern of Stade at Stadersand, begins. Because of the deepening of the Elbe the average tidal hub of the lower reach rose to , because of the backlog when the sluice gates are closed the fluctuations of the upper reach only amounts to a few decimeters. Despite the embankment the banks of the lower reach are lined with exceptional rare fresh water mudflats. The Schwinge is a federal waterway from the Elbe to the Salztorschleuse. Since the completion of the Schwingesperrwerk, a flood barrier near the mouth of the river in 1971, all places at the Schwinge are protected better against storm surges. The gap is closed with two gates. From the Late Middle Ages until the 1950s the Schwinge was used for the transport of goods with smack-like ships called \\"\\". During dredging of the Schwinge and the Hansehafen countless historic artefacts were found, including famous Ulfberht swords from the 8th to 12th century. Today, however, the leisure and sports boat traffic dominates the shipping on the lower reach, the upper reach beyond Stade isn't navigable.

The original owner's last name was also \\"He\\".  Family Affairs & National Affairs  = About the Master = Born in 1835,He Zhidao(a 19th century Chinese envoy to France) had been appointed as the governor of Hangyang Prefecture ,Huang-zhou Prefecture and De\`an Prefecture ,and supervisor of jianghan Barrier. He was alsoawarded to be a top ranking official of the consulting minister and later to be grand minister of consultation. National Affairs Crisis Since the country was surrounded by dangers then,He Zhidao could do nothing for his patriotism and anticipations to help the country become stronger and had to resign in middle age. = Chizhi University = Subject to his last wish,He Zhidao's descendants established Chizhi University with his remaining capitals in 1924,more than years after his death. After its establishment, Chizhi University had cultivated a lot of ambitious youths and made great contribution to the country in that age. History The He Garden is a typical residential garden, built in 1883 during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor in the Qing dynasty. The garden was built on the old site of the Garden of Double Pagoda Trees. And now there is still one pagoda tree left in He Garden. Its original name is translated \\"Mountain Villa for Ease of Singing\\". The owner was He Weijian, (also known as He Zhidao). He Zhidao was born in Wangjiang, Anhui. With his father's approval, he moved to Yangzhou, bought the site of the former Sliced Stone Mountain Villa, rebuilt and expanded it. When it was finished, the owner named the garden \\"Ease of singing\\" (borrowed from two lines of a poem, \\"On Returning Home\\", written by Tao Yuanming).

Around the garden there are only buildings, without mountains or running water. Absorbing the essence of traditional Chinese gardening, He Garden introduced western landscape architecture and has established its own style. Chinese experts on ancient gardens have long praised the art employed in building He Garden, calling it \\"a single case of gardens in South of the Yangtze River area\\". The garden comprises three parts (the west and east gardens, the residential area and courtyard and the mountain villa) which are arranged in a chain. With both Chinese and Western features, the garden can be used as both a residence and a scenic spot. Its designer endeavored to create an ideal residence; their efforts are included in the book, The Wonders of Yangzhou City.

One of the two subspecies, P. p. lucida, is commonly known as the Eltham copper. The larvae feed on Bursaria spinosa and are associated with Notoncus ants. Distribution It is found in eastern Australia from central Queensland through eastern New South Wales and into eastern Victoria. Outlying populations occur in north Queensland and central Victoria.  Behavior  The larvae of P. p. lucida are nocturnal and feed solely on Busaria spinosa after dusk for many hours. When the temperature is above 15 ¬∞C, the larvae become inactive. They live for long periods of time, and remain active, though less-so, in the winter months. During these times, they rest in the subterranean nest chambers of different Notoncus ants, depending on their geographic distribution. During the day, larvae also rest in the ants' nest chambers near the roots of B. spinosa. At night, ants herd the larvae up the Busaria plants. Their movement signals to other larvae, creating large numbers of movement each night. Several ants commonly accompany individual larva and remain with them until they finish eating. If a larva is disturbed while feeding, it retreats back into the nest and usually does not return that night. Larvae do not leave their host plant and ant nest during their development, and they pupate inside the ant nest. Taxonomy The fiery copper was first described by Rudolph Rosenstock in 1885. =Subspecies= The species is divided into the following two subspecies: * Paralucia pyrodiscus pyrodiscus (found from southern Queensland to eastern Victoria) * Paralucia pyrodiscus lucida Crosby, 1951 (the Eltham copper, found in central Victoria, especially Eltham)  Conservation  The subspecies Eltham copper was thought extinct in the 1950s. A major conservation movement surrounding it started in 1987 after a colony in the Melbourne area was found. It is listed as \\"threatened\\" on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Populations have declined due to loss of habitat by urbanisation and loss of a natural fire regime. Two reserves in Eltham were partially burnt in 1998 in an attempt to improve habitat quality for the Eltham copper.

The context of the show is that unsuspecting and often male passers are put in comical situations by three female decoys: Annett Fleischer, Isabell Polak and Manuela Wisbeck. Female stereotypes and corresponding reactions by men are put in the foreground during the show.

Plot summary The series' plot revolves around the everyday life at Lurzer KG, a small firm producing gym equipment. It deals with both the personal relationships among the staff (including romance, friendships, and feuds) and the highs and lows of running a business. The latter topic includes rationalisation, incorporation (and later exclusion) into an American holding company, and having to move the office several times. Running gags in the show include the constant personal absence of the company's manager, Mr. Lurzer, and that the attempts of his subordinate executives - especially personnel manager Dr. Herbert Brokstedt (Joachim Wichmann), and his successor Dr. Adalbert-Wilhelm Schmitt-Lausitz (Ralf Wolter) - to motivate the rest of the staff tend to produce anything but the desired effect.

This leads to the filtering of lower frequency inputs signals, leaving the steady state output unaffected by unwanted low frequency inputs.  General BackgroundLevine, W.S., ‚ÄúThe Control Handbook‚Äù, CRC Press, 23 Feb 1996, Pg. 963.  The common transfer function for a washout filter is: G(s) = \\\\frac{y_i(s)}{x_i(s)} = \\\\frac{s}{s+d} Where x_i is the input variable, y_i is the output of the function for the filter, and the frequency of the filter is set in the denominator. This filter will only produce a non-zero output only during transient periods when the input signal is of higher frequency and not in a constant steady state value. Conversely, the filter will ‚Äúwash out‚Äù sensed input signals that is of lower frequency (constant steady-state signal). [C.K. Wang]  Flight Control Application  = Yaw Control SystemSchmidt, L.V., ‚ÄúIntroduction to Aircraft Flight Dynamics‚Äù, AIAA, 1998, Pg. 242. = In modern swept wing aircraft, yaw damping control systems are used to dampen and stabilize the Dutch-roll motion of an aircraft in flight. However, when a pilot inputs a command to yaw the aircraft for maneuvering (such as steady turns), the rudder becomes a single control surface that functions to dampen the Dutch-roll motion and yaw the aircraft. The result is a suppressed yaw rate and more required input from the pilot to counter the suppression. [C.K. Wang] To counter the yaw command suppression, the installation of washout filters before the yaw dampers and rudder actuators will allow the yaw damper feedback loop in the control system to filter out the low frequency signals or state inputs. In the case of a steady turn during flight, the low frequency signal is the pilot command and the washout filter will allow the turn command signal to not be dampened by the yaw damper in the feedback circuit. [C.K. Wang] An example of this use of can be located at Yaw Damper Design for a 747¬Æ Jet.

Biography D√∂bereiner was born in √öst√≠ nad Labem, Czechoslovakia on the 28 November 1924. Her family were German Czechoslovakians from Aussig in Bohemia (at that time was Austria‚ÄìHungary Empire and now is Czech Republic), who left the country after World War II. Her father was Professor Paul Kubelka. Her name D√∂bereiner came from her husband J√ºrgen D√∂bereiner, who she met in Munich. Interestingly, her name became similar to the famous chemist Johann Wolfgang D√∂bereiner, who was born in Hof, Bavaria, in the border with Bohemia. Johanna D√∂bereiner received her degree from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, but settled in Brazil and became a Brazilian citizen in 1956. Her early work includes studies of Azospirillum and other bacteria that could be useful to Brazilian soil. She later played an important role in Brazil's soybean production by encouraging a reliance on varieties that solely depended on biological nitrogen fixation. As a consequence of her research and ideas, numerous soybean plantations in Brazil are now completely supplied for nitrogen (N) by rhizobia and not using any N-fertilizers. This movement has had big benefits, because Brazil, together with the U.S., are the main producers of soybean in the world (ca. 50% world production). Considering that soybeans are one of the most important global sources of protein (mainly fed to animals that in turn becomes animal protein for human consumption), this implies that significant amount of global protein comes from an ecological biological process without the use of industrial chemical fertilizers. This was one of the reasons that Johanna D√∂bereiner was indicated for the Nobel Prize in the 1990s. The Johanna D√∂bereiner Biological Resources Center was named in her honour in 2017.

Produced by the Augsburger Puppenkiste, which was created in 1991 under the direction of Sepp Strubel in cooperation with the Hessischer Rundfunk and was first broadcast in 1992/1993. Setting All actions take place in the fictional jungle village named Cocopalmariocasas on the Cocopalmario river. Cocopalmariocasas can only be reached by a river and there is only one phone in the village square. The other places where the village community meets are the jetty at Cocopalmario and an ice cream parlor. Characters All characters are represented as personalized animal figures. The main actors are the three minors Elinor, Zapp and Bubu, who investigate minor crime cases as detectives. A number of other residents live across the village, who are occasionally involved in the plot. Many villagers like to sing. The most important characters in detail: * 'Elinor' is a hippo who is a fan of 'Inspector Camembert' , a cartoon hero with a trench coat and floppy hat, whom she has in the only TV in Cocopalmariocasas admired in the restaurant by Jojo. She is afraid of water and easily gets runny nose. * 'Zapp' is a heron who is very smart and can write with his beak and makes technical inventions in his workshop. He often uses the exclamation \\"There's a lot going on in my head\\" and \\"Belahuahe\\". He avoids flying. * 'Bubu' is a chimpanzee who has an aunt called' Madame Juliette '. He lives in a tree house, for which Zapp has built an elevator for so that he can be visited by all other villagers. He is very musical and plays two hands on his xylophone. He often affirms statements with yes, yes, yes . * 'Sheriff M√ºller' is a bear who is responsible for the police work in the jungle, but according to his own account is permanently overloaded. He spends most of his time in a hammock and is the only resident to have an off-road vehicle and a motor boat. * 'Jojo' is a dog who is the ice cream shop owner. From time to time he visits his beloved dog friend, the photo model 'Irene' from abroad, who otherwise sends him postcards every day. Zapp built him a wind mill for electricity with which his television can be operated. However, the refrigerator must be cooled with ice delivered daily. * The 'Bird of Paradise' is predominantly concerned with its magnificent appearance and has for this purpose a mirror, in which it singing's its recurring narcissistic table song Jeez, what am I beautiful looks into it. * 'Captain Freshwater Charly' is a beaver who sails to the village daily in his steamboat. It not only transports mail and goods, but also visitors. He tends to sing sad shanty's. * 'Frau Kangaroo' collects and distributes the mail items to and from Cocopalmariocasas. Otherwise, she is very talkative and had never received any mail herself until she received a message and a lottery ticket. * 'Nickel Kanin' is a helpful but also curious rabbit who is always happy to help out the three jungle detectives, which he then mostly confirms with the exclamation \\"Egg, self-reliant!\\". He can run very quickly, sing beautifully and sleepily despite his speech impairment and insists on not being a rabbit. * 'G√ºrtli' is an armadillo who is very proud of the belts he produces that are exported all over the world. * 'Pfleger K√ºmmelmann' is a stork who is responsible for the retirement home of the village. He is very polite and correct. On his one-day off a week he is represented by the duck 'Miss Sieben' . * 'Detlef' is a greyhound with the pseudonym en 'Dr. Lippsel 'and' Dr. Funkstedt ', he sells the residents of the old people's home unnecessary products at inflated prices. He is in a relationship with \\"Miss Sieben\\". He visits the village with his own boat. * 'Oma Schildpatt' , a very old turtle, is a resident of the old people's home. She is very hard of hearing. * 'Grandpa Siegfried' is an elk who is the only male resident of the old people's home. He is always dressed correctly, can hardly see anything, but still has good ears. In his home country he saved up north to be able to afford his retirement home in Cocopalmariocasas. * 'Frau Arbez' is a zebra, who prefers to stand in front of a fence for camouflage. The best compliment you can give her is to tell her that you couldn't find her there. Otherwise, she is very simple, likes to giggle and also lives in the nursing home. * 'Mr Svoboda' is a turkey who is the reliable shopkeeper who has almost everything on offer in the village in his general store. * 'Mr. and Mrs. Panda' are very domestic and like to feed on bamboo. * 'Mr and Mrs Raccoon' are busy washing clothes all day. * 'Mr. and Mrs. Schmitt' are aardvarks. They live very quietly in an earthwork, cannot read and show a reserved, naive and benign mind. * 'Lord of Pelicans' is imaginary and often seems to be without understanding. * 'Mr. Oka Pi' is an okapi who leads tour groups to and through Cocopalmariocasas and stands out due to well-intentioned tips that are not always as fun as they are meant to be. * The 'Theater elephant' visits the village as an experienced and well-traveled showman. The three jungle detectives help him prepare and carry out his performance. Otherwise, penguins appear as tourists, the crocodiles as villainous gang members and three whispering owls appear at night.

(English: Elephant, Tiger & Co.) is a German television series from the Central German Broadcasting (Mitteldeutschen Rundfunk) which has been aired since 1 April 2003. It is considered to be the most successful German zoo docusoap. Its setting is Leipzig Zoological Garden.  Content  In the series the everyday life of zoo animals is described, as well as the work of the zookeepers, curators, and veterinary physicians. For example, the development of the small Angola lion Malik, the rehearsals for the advertising appearance of llama Horst and alpaca Harry, as well as the animals moving into the newly built Gondwanaland. In 2010 and 2011, Virginia opossum Heidi, who has died in the meantime and was part of the cast, had a show on the Internet dedicated to her.  Background  From 5 March 2002 the MDR showed 15-minute- episodes of \\"elephant, tiger and Co.\\" with the second title \\"Tierzulande\\" in the series \\"this country\\" at 9:30 pm. In total, 12 episodes were aired, beginning with the episode \\"Operation day in the Zoo\\" and produced by DocStation (book/Director: Katrin peoples, Marcus otter). Due to immense popularity the MDR took over the series themselves and aired it from 1 April 2003 independently. By including the zookeepers' personalities in the concept and the plot of the series, the series is considered a pioneer in the field of zoo docusoaps. The success of elephant and tiger & Co. exceeded the expectations of both the MDR and the zoo. There have now been more than 670 episodes produced and broadcast. In the beginning 15-minute, later 25-minute episodes were produced for the Central German Radio . For the afternoon program of \\"Das Erste\\" repeats of the television series were cut into 45-minute blocks. The broadcast of the first season was watched by an average of 1.93 million viewers.Pressemappe der ARD: Zoogeschichten im Ersten. 333 Folgen & mehr..., 2007, S. 4. The second season, which was broadcast from 27. December 2006 to 5. April 2007, reached an average of 2.64 million viewers.Stand: 15. M√§rz 2007/Pressemappe der ARD: Zoogeschichten im Ersten. 333 Folgen & mehr..., 2007, S. 5. The serial was developed substantially by the two TV writers Jan Tenhaven and Axl Friedrich. By now, there are nine other authors responsible: Jens Straw Schieder, Kerstin Holl, Antje Schneider, Eva Demmler, Lutz Tauscher, Stefanie Wagemann, Christiane Probst, Beate Gerber and Melanie Henze. Speaker and - in special programs - intermittent actor is the musician and actor Christian Steyer. His substitute is the radio drama actor Uve Teschner.  More zoo docusoaps  In the footsteps of the idea for Elephant, Tiger & Co. more zoo docusoaps were created, such as Pinguin, L√∂we & Co. from M√ºnster Zoo, and Panda, Gorilla & Co. from Tierpark Berlin and Berlin Zoological Garden. More spin-off series followed and the ZDF also broadcast similar series using titles such as Berliner Schnauzen from the Berlin Zoological Garden and Tierisch K√∂lsch from Cologne Zoo. In reaction to these many spin-offs the closing title Elephant, Tiger & Co. - The Original was added to the credits. In the speech held for the opening of the new elephants¬¥ enclosure at Leipzig zoo in March 2006, Bernhard Blaszkiewitz, previous director of Tierpark Berlin, stressed the use of all zoos in this broadcasting format, while demanding that ‚Äúmore information should be provided again in such series‚Äù.Bernhard Blaszkiewitz: Gru√üwort zur Er√∂ffnung des Elefantentempels Ganesha Mandir am 31.

It is a co-production between seven European TV stations in which each station produced a number of episodes which were then pooled, dubbed and otherwise adapted when needed and broadcast by all participating stations, a format used earlier in the German crime series Tatort. The participating networks were ZDF from Germany, ORF from Austria, SRG from Switzerland, RAI from Italy, Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola from Spain, Antenne 2 from France and Channel 4 from the United Kingdom. A direct consequence of the 'pooled production' format was that all episodes by one particular network had a strong local -even national- feel and were distinctly different from the episodes produced by other networks. Not only were they filmed in the network's own country with local actors, but they were also written by local screenwriters, thus reflecting that nation's specific taste for crime dramas. With national networks at that time still relying on self-produced programs, a big part of Eurocop's allure was that it offered viewers in one country a first-hand look at what crime series in other countries looked like. Despite being a pan- European TV series, the three German speaking networks did more than half of the filming with Germany and Austria filming 15 episodes on their own and one more joint production. Switzerland contributed another 12. Of the four non- German speaking countries, Italy made 13 episodes and France made 8, whereas Spain and the UK made only 4 and 3 episodes respectively. All in all, in a span of five and a half years, seventy-one episodes were produced. Typically they were broadcast once a month. In Germany, ZDF broadcast the series on every fourth Friday as part of its Friday night crime lineup. (The three other Fridays it would broadcast episodes from other homemade crime series). Its first broadcast was on November 6, 1988 with a Swiss production called \\"Tote reisen nicht\\" (Dead men don't travel).  Introduction and title music  A little sensation for its time was the title sequence. Not only was the title music a haunting electronic theme composed by Jan Hammer, it was accompanied by a wild camera ride in which a camera circles over a map of Europe, shows the different cities in which the episodes play and for each city shows a picture of the local detective with his name and title. Finally the camera zooms out into a picture of the police badge of the country in which the episode in question plays. Still a novelty for this time, the title was completely computer generated.

The concept of the series was developed and produced from 1969 as a successor of the children's series \\"Spielschule\\" and shot in Munich, because the BR managers considered, that the social situation in Germany was not correctly represented by Sesamstra√üe and therefore needed a replacement program.Dieter Sch√§fer: Die Entwicklung der Gameshow im Kinderfernsehen des Bayrischen Rundfunks.

The aim of the series was to stimulate the imagination of the audience and to teach social interaction. In the first five episodes the two dolls Maxifant and Minifant played in the series, which then got their own series, because the production partners separated. Instead, the puppets Biff and Wuff (designed by Jan Gulbransson) and the animated character Wummi were used. During the episodes several fairy tales were recounted, especially Grimms' fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, Doctor Know-All, or The Brave Little Tailor. In addition, stories with Felix (Uwe Falkenbach) and brother Tom (Erich Schleyer), of which 25 episodes appeared on DVD, the thin Mr. Schwarz (Josef Schwarz) and the fat Mr. Kern (Peter Kern) as well as with the dream car. The best-known season within the series was \\"Das Haus mit der Nr. 30\\" (The House with the No. 30) that was on air from 1977 to 1979 with 41 episodes.DVD-√úbersicht auf digitalvd.de, abgerufen am 2.

A technical innovation in television at the time was, that the graphical representation of the fairy tales, e.g. Doctor Know- All, The Blue Light, The Brave Little Tailor, or The Old Sultan was designed with the bluescreen technique. Further episodes ran under the title Geschichten mit Philipp Sonntag und seinem Traummobil, Kern und Schwarz, Felix und Bruder Tom. In spring of 2009, the German Opel Museum acquired the original car (an Opel Blitz, year of construction: 1962) of the first season, which remained almost unchanged, from its last owner.

It was produced by Novafilm Fernsehproduktion. F√ºr alle F√§lle Stefanie follows the professional and personal life of nurse Stefanie Engel, then Stephanie Wilde and for a short time Fanny 'Stephanie' Stephan. The show was a giant success for the network and had around seven, in later years, five million viewers on a weekly basis. It won the Goldene Kamera award in 1997 and the Bavarian TV Award in 1996. Production =Development= The show premiered in 1995 and soon became a hit for the network. In the beginning, the show's working title was Stefanie - Schwester mit Herz, which was later used for a rerun of the early seasons. Kathrin Waligura leaves the show after the first two seasons as the show's title role Stefanie Engel. Her successor, Stephanie Wilde played by Claudia Schmutzler, was introduced in the last episodes of the second season and took over as the show's lead in season three. Schmutzler became the identification of the show and was wildly popular. She carried F√ºr alle F√§lle Stefanie through its best years and decided to leave in early 1999. Julia Hentschel took over as Fanny Stephan who was soon nicknamed Stephanie. However, under Hentschel the show started to do poorly in ratings. The network offered Schmutzler a new contract, which allowed her many amenities. The show was brought back to new success and stayed a strong performer through the end of season ten. The season finale featured Stephanie Wilde's death and resulted in Schmutzler leaving the show for a second time. It followed a reboot attempt with the start of the 11th season, which saw the return of Kathrin Waligura as the original Stefanie. She was now a doctor and changed the tone of the show. Much of the show's cast was changed with the focus on the doctors rather than the nurses as it has been in the previous years. The production changed the show's title into Stefanie - Eine Frau startet durch. The show couldn't reach to former success, only having three million viewers left at the peak. Sat.1 decided to cancel the show. The series finale, intended to be a season finale, aired in March 2004 as the last season ended its rerun with a few new episodes in the morning hours. =Broadcasting= It premiered on Monday nights at 8:00 pm at a time where Sat.1 tried to challenge Das Erste's Tagesschau. The attempt failed and Sat.1 later returned to start their primetime at 8:15 pm after the Tagesschau was over. The third season premiered on a new night, Thursdays at 9:15 pm. The show regularly won its time slot. In April 1999, the show started suffering in ratings after Schmutzler left the show. As ratings fell under five million viewers, Schmutzler was brought back. The show recovered and was back to its former success in the end of 2000. The 10th season premiered on 8 July 2004 as a spinoff in its new time slot at 8:15 pm on Thursday nights. The ratings dropped to a new low and Sat.1 put the season on a break in September 2004, then returning in its old time slot in December. However, as ratings didn't recover the network put the show on another hiatus while announcing that the 11th season is the series finale. The last episodes of the final season were then part of a rerun with the series finale airing on 10 March 2005 at 11:00 am.

With the help of an elderly uncle who was Cecilia's father (Oskar Schwab) and an old friend of Cecilia's (Robert Naegele), the Laroche children piece together the mystery of the death of their cousin, the unknown man in the mirror, and a little leather crocodile they find with strange gleaming eyes.

Half-day caretaker Dieter Krause is the embodiment of the German \\"square\\"; he is pernickety, blindly follows order, denounces others, is nosy, consistently puts his own interests above all else, acts subservient to his superiors and is brutish and unjust to those he deemes below him.

The 26-part series is an adaptation of the American sitcom Married... with Children.  Background  The series contained scripts and sets that were almost exact copies of the original American ones, lacking any cultural changes necessary to properly adapt it into German culture. Even the looks and gestures of the actors had to be exactly like in the original US series. Further contributing to the series' failure was the fact that Married... with Children had already premiered in Germany a year before and was broadcast daily in the afternoon while Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt was broadcast once a week in the evening, on the same station.  Reception  The series was critically panned due to the poor translation and adaptation of the original scripts. German newspaper taz called it \\"very boring\\", while 20 years later in a retrospective article on the show, Der Spiegel said that it \\"couldn't work\\". Christian Richter of Quotenmeter.de called it \\"the probably most colourless comedy series on German television\\".

Now these are aired mostly in two parts, so there is a 14 -, as well as a 17 episode version of the series. Curth Flatow wrote the screenplays, directed by Peter Weck. The film's music is composed by Alain Goraguer. The divorced Angelika \\"Angi\\" Graf (Thekla Carola Wied) lives in Berlin with her three children, teenager Tanja (Julia Biedermann) and younger boys Markus and Tom where she runs a small children's boutique called \\"Boutique for little people\\". Her friends Sybille \\"Bille\\" (Maria Sebaldt) and Alfons Vonhoff (Herbert B√∂tticher) are convinced that Angi needs a new man in her life. So they try to match-make her with Vienna-born commercial artist Werner Schumann (Peter Weck) who is a times divorcee himself and is being watched over by an overly protective jealous housekeeper Mrs. Raabe (Bruni L√∂bel). Bille and Alfons' idea first does not go to plan when Werner unexpectedly brings his current liaison to the party they had organized to bring Angi and Werner together. However Angi and Werner get acquainted with each other and end up secretly dating, unknown to their mutual friend who tried to match-make them. But Werner does not know that Angi has three kids. When he eventually proposes to Angi she has to confess that she is not on her own. A few days later she invites Werner to her youngest son Tom's birthday party so he can meet her 3 children. He takes a liking to the kids and wows to wed Angi and her entire family (therefore the title \\"Ich heirate eine Familie\\" - I am marrying a family). Angi and her children move into Werner's house and Werner discovers what life with a sudden big family means. Torn from his sleep early in the morning by noisy school children, Werner soon experiences how children's illnesses, an addition to the family, a move into a new house, Markus running away, Werner's 50th birthday, pubescent Tanja discovering boys and having a wild birthday party, a winter journey to the snow and one into the sun and Angi's new career keep life turbulent for the Schumanns. The screenplay includes strong dialogue of wit and irony and ensures some slapstick. Above all the representation of Werner and his Vienna's charm is a pillar of the story. In contrast to Schumann's happy marriage are their wealthy friends Bille & Alfons. She is a quite quirky character who lives in a big house with her husband, likes the nice things in life like holidays, expensive clothes, furs and jewelry. Alfons, who owns a big prosperous supermarket chain and cannot resist to philander with young women. Guilt- ridden he often bribes his wife of 20-odd years back in his arms with yet another fur, ring or flowers. They also have their loveable moments, but greatly add to the comical side of the series with their little tiffs. Flatow processed autobiographical experiences in his script because he had married a woman with several children. The role of the Werner Schumann was originally set to be played by Harald Juhnke, and Peter Weck directing. But Juhnkes alcohol problems prevented his commitment. And so Peter Weck took over the role.

Aware that her husband has a mistress, Stella debates leaving him, but ultimately becomes involved in his illegal businesses. * Mi≈°el Matiƒçeviƒá is Misha, a Russian Thief in law, the owner of the Odessa night club, and Stella's husband. The night club serves as the headquarters of the crime family that Misha leads and which has made him a fortune through the black market trade in untaxed cigarettes. Despite having a mistress, Misha is shown to be far more loving and considerate to his wife than Tony Soprano, which is why she reluctantly stays with him. Early in the series, Misha attempts to corrupt Marek by feeding him information about a rival crime family. Although this is a violation of the Thieves' Law, Misha rationalizes his act by reminding his followers that the rival gang rejects the Law completely. Misha's violation of the Law ultimately fails to corrupt Marek and leads both crime families to the brink of war. * Ryszard Ronczewski is Uncle Sasha, a Soviet Jewish Thief in law from Odessa and relative to Marek and Stella. Despite appearing to be merely the simple owner of a shoe repair shop, Uncle Sasha is viewed as the elder statesman of Berlin's Russian underworld. In a conversation with Stella, Uncle Sasha relates how he has an entire room filled with the shoes of other Soviet Jewish immigrants who have joined the city's criminal underworld and been killed in its quarrels. Despite his relation to Marek, Uncle Sasha refuses to violate the Thieves' Law by revealing the name of the man who murdered Marek's brother. * Alina Levshin is Yelena, a young and beautiful Ukrainian woman who has been lured into emigrating to Germany under the promise that she will work in a restaurant. Upon arrival, Yelena learns that she and her close friend Svetlana have been duped by a sex trafficking ring and that they are expected to work as prostitutes. Unlike Svetlana, Yelena is unwilling to turn tricks and longs to escape the prostitution ring. Shortly before leaving for Germany, Yelena has a vision under water which leads her to believe that Marek is her true love.

The series counts 13 episodes and is based upon the books The Little Vampire Takes a Trip and The Little Vampire on the Farm, which are part of the Der kleine Vampir series written by German author Angela Sommer- Bodenburg. The series had previously been the basis for the 1986 series Der kleine Vampir, which was based upon other books in the series. Different actors were used for the 1993 series because the original actors had grown too old for the roles by that point. The 1993 series is neither a successor concerning the story. The 1993 series also introduces the characters of the parents of Anna and Rudiger. Uncle Theodor, who was a main character in the 1986 series, does not appear in the 1993 series because he is dead (which is in line with the books).  Synopsis  Anton Bohnsack, a 10-year-old boy, is befriended with R√ºdiger von Schlotterstein and his sister Anna. Anton's parents, Helga and Robert, are not very eager as R√ºdiger and Anna are rather marginal: they are filthy and wear odd clothes. In reality, R√ºdiger and Anna are vampires living with their family in a secret crypt at the old part of the local cemetery. Anton experiences many adventures with the vampires which he also tells to his parents. They do not believe him as Anton has a fascination with horrorstories. Anna and R√ºdiger can fly by using their vampire cloaks. (They do not need the flying powder as in the first series)). They gave Anton the vampire cloak of their uncle Theodor who was once killed by vampire hunters. Furthermore, Anna is in love with Anton. Anton is cheered with the upcoming holidays, but his parents decided to spend their vacation at a farm in Ottenb√ºttel. Anton asks R√ºdiger to join, but he refuses as he is not confident with a (temporarily) live at a farm. Due to an incident between R√ºdiger and his cousin J√∂rg, R√ºdiger is forced to hide so he and Anna do travel to the farm. R√ºdiger is almost trapped by the farmer. Doctor Heinrich St√∂bermann reveals to be a vampire hunter and a good friend of Johann Geiermeier. Geiermeier, also a vampire hunter, is the handyman and gravedigger of the cemetery where R√ºdiger and his family reside. Heinrich suspects there are vampires around the farm and asks Geiermeier to come over. Geiermeier ends up in a vampire trap set up by St√∂bermann. Next day, a furious Geiermeier leaves the farm and does not want to see St√∂bermann anymore. Anton, who learned to ride the horses, wins a horseman tournament. He, R√ºdiger and Anna also go to the \\"International Vampire Party\\". Anton is surprised to meet his parents at the party.  Episodes  ;1 Schreck in der Abendstunde (Fear in the night) Anton is home alone: his parents Helga and Robert are in the theatre. Anton decides to give his friend R√ºdiger a visit in his crypt where they play \\"vampire and hunter\\". Anton's parents are home early and inform the police as their son is not in. Meanwhile, R√ºdiger's other family members are heading towards the crypt. They are stopped by gravedigger Johan Geiermeier, also a vampire hunter. The family can escape. When Anton enters his house, he needs to clarify where he was. Although he tells the truth, his parent do not believe him. He is grounded for a week. His parents also tell they are going on vacation in Ottenb√ºttel where they'll reside at a farm. ;2 Anna in Not (Anna in trouble) Anna plays at the edge of the cemetery and is caught by Geiermeier. He takes her to his house. Her mother, Hildegard die Durstige (Hildegard the Thirsty) is a witness and sneakily enters Geiermeier's house. She hears how Geiermeier tries to confess Anna she is a vampire. A crying Hildegard seeks to the crypt for help. R√ºdiger has a plan: Anna must convince Geiermeier she is human and flies to Anton. Also Anna has a plan: she tries to convince Geiermeier to be a sister of Anton and to call him. R√ºdiger arrives at Anton's place, but he can't help as he is grounded. That's why they switch. Anton tells his parents he is going to sleep, but it is actually R√ºdiger who goes to the bedroom. Anton runs to Geiermeier. To prove he is human, Anton eats some garlic. This satisfies Geiermeier and he releases Anna. Back home, Anton asks R√ºdiger to join him on his vacation, but R√ºdiger refuses. ;3 √úberraschung in der Nacht (Surprise during the night) Anton's parents have to go to a dinner and ask their neighbor miss Puvogel, addicted to television, to be the nanny. Anton tells miss Puvogel he is tired and goes to bed. He sneaks away and visits the fair together with R√ºdiger. They enter a haunted house where R√ºdiger smashes one of the dolls with a stick. It turns out not to be a doll, but a cousin of R√ºdiger: J√∂rg der Aufbrausende (J√∂rg the irascible). He hid in the haunted house to get \\"a snack\\". J√∂rg chases after R√ºdiger and swears to break all his bones. Geiermeier, also at the fair, spots the vampires. That's why J√∂rg abates the chasing temporarily. R√ºdiger decides to join Anton to the farm as J√∂rg will not search him over there. ;4 Geiermeiers Verdacht (Geiermeier's suspicion) Anna lent her friendshipbook to Anton so he will be the first human who'll write something in the book. The book ends up in hands of Geiermeier who now thinks Anton and his parents are vampires. Next morning, Geiermeier sneaks into the bedroom of Anton's parents and is about to stick them. Anton can prevent this by opening the curtains so he can prove he and his parents can stand the sunlight. Due to Anton's fascination of horror, Geiermeier concludes the book contains stories made up by Anton and overhands to book. Anton returns it to Anna. Due to the nightly escapades Anton's school results are decreasing. That's why his school teacher, Miss Schlauberger, wants a meeting with his parents. ;5 Der Sarg muss mit (The coffin must come over) Soon, Anton departs with his parents to the farm. R√ºdiger wants to join to stay out of J√∂rg sight. There is a major problem: how must a vampire travel? That's why his coffin is wrapped with paper and R√ºdiger dresses up as a human. Like this they leave the crypt to head to the railway station. At the cemetery they meet Geiermeier. He considered Anton and Anna to be vampires, but after latest incidents he believes they are human. Due to the disguise, Geiermeier thinks R√ºdiger is from Tyrol. The children conceive Geiermeier by telling him the package contains 7000 garlic stringent. He helps them by carrying the package.

Anton explains the ticket-collector the old lady misinterpret the situation. The journey continuous, but R√ºdiger goes to the old lady and tells her he is a real vampire. The old lady faints.

The farmer's woman discovers the chicken are not in their run anymore. She also finds a weird cloak. She calls doctor St√∂bermann for an investigation: he is certain this is the work of vampires. ;8 Gl√ºck im Ungl√ºck (Every cloud has a silver lining) Anton is ill and his mother calls doctor St√∂bermann. St√∂bermann reveals to be a vampire hunter. Farmer Hering now uses R√ºdigers cloak as a scarecrow. Anna, who had to escape for Geiermeier before, travels to Ottenb√ºttel by foot. She sees the cloak in a grassland and thinks her brother is dead. At this time, St√∂bermann passes with his Dalmatian Brutus. He is in search for vampires and finds a crying Anna. She tells St√∂berman she is trying to find her friend Anton. St√∂berman takes Anna to the farm. Not much later, St√∂bermann, Anna and Anton see how R√ºdiger must climb into a tree for Brutus. Anna en Anton convince St√∂bermann Brutus did not attack R√ºdiger as he would be a vampire, but as the dog was scared for some other reason. ;9 Vom Teufel geritten (Speak of the Devil) The countryside now appeals to R√ºdiger. He, Anna and Anton find some horses and are riding them each night. Some days later, farmer Hering calls St√∂bermann to check up the horses as they are tired for unknown reasons. St√∂bermann thinks to have a suspect and this is confirmed when he sees a flying Anna. Next, St√∂bermann calls his friend Geiermeier. Both vampire hunters set up a trap. Geiermeier ends up in a vampire trap set up by St√∂bermann. Next day, a furious Geiermeier leaves and discontinues his friendship with St√∂bermann.

There, they are surprised by St√∂berman who can grab Anton. Anna escapes. Anton persuades St√∂bermann he is hiding for a dark vampire and is now scared to go to the farm alone. St√∂bermann takes Anton to the farm and interrogates him about the vampire's presence. Meanwhile, aunt Dorothee arrives in Ottenb√ºttel and hides in same windmill. Some days later, it turns out the vampire described by Anton does exist. It seems to be Ludwig der F√ºrchterliche, the father of Anna and R√ºdiger, also hiding in the windmill. Ludwig and Anna go to the church where he plays the organ for her. St√∂bermann discovers this event and asks Anton to become his assistance as a vampire hunter. After sunset, farmer Hering invites St√∂bermann, Helga and Robert for a drink. Helga sees a big bat in the sky, but soon realizes this might be a vampire. ;11 Die Gruselshow (The eerie show). Anton discovers St√∂bermann made some vampire traps disguised as coffins. He alerts the vampires. Meanwhile, The Peanuts, an American family travelling in Germany, made attention of the windmill and want to buy it. Lumpi, the elder brother of Anna and R√ºdiger, also arrived. He has an idea: they will surprise the Peanuts with an eerie show. However, the Peanuts think the show is a genius act. Now, they are willing to buy the windmill and to give the \\"actors\\" a contact to perform their show in America. Their opinion changes after mister Peanuts lies down in a coffin which is actually a vampire trap made by St√∂bermann. Due to this incident, the Peanuts are not willing to buy the windmill anymore as it attracts vampires. ;12 Der blutrote Rubin (The blood-red ruby) St√∂bermann is certain: vampires are hiding in the old windmill. Although Anton tries to stop St√∂bermann, last one finds R√ºdiger's coffin. After opening, it seems to be empty. The vampire family travelled back to their own crypt to pick up a blood-red ruby. It is a floating trophy which is to win during the International Vampire Party and was granted to the Schlottersteins 130 years earlier. There is now a panic as the blood-red ruby can't be found. R√ºdiger's great parents Sabine der Schrecklichen and Wilhelm dem W√ºsten assume the ruby was stolen by vampire hunter Kuno B√∂sermann after he stabbed vampire Viktoria die Ungl√ºckliche. Dismayed they head back to the old windmill. When Anton hears about the missing ruby, he starts an investigation. It turns out Kuno's real last name is St√∂bermann and the grandfather of doctor St√∂bermann. Anton, Anna and R√ºdiger sneak into his house and find the ruby. ;13 Das Vampirfest (The vampire party) The International Vampire Party takes place in an abandoned factory not so far from the windmill. Anton, dressed up as a vampire, joins with R√ºdiger and Anna. He is introduced as Uwe der Unerschrockene. Anton is wondered when he finds out his parents are also at the party. However, they think to be supporting actors for a vampire movie. That's why R√ºdiger introduces them as being members of the \\"Skorpio-clan\\", a fearful vampire clan. This will prevent them to stay unaffected. During the climax of the party, Anton gets the highest honor title and will be the new owner of the ruby. This is a huge problem: Anton and his parents must organize the next International Vampire Party which will only take place after 130 years. Anton makes up he just became a vampire and should not be considered to get the title already. Anton's mother leaves the party to get a breath of air. She is overpowered by St√∂bermann who wants to destroy her. Luckily, Helga can remove her fake vampire teeth to show she is human. A disordered St√∂bermann slinks of. Next day, the family Bohnsack travels back homewards and take R√ºdiger's coffin with them. Helga and Robert think the coffin is a prop used to make the movie.

In the broadcast, the criminal investigation department presents unresolved crimes and asks the viewers to make relevant information about the reconnaissance. In contrast to Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st, Kripo live not only deals with capital crimes but also less serious crimes. The program was moderated by Heike Lebe, who later switched to the production team and gave the presentation to Birgit von Derschau, which led through the show until 2013. Her substitution was Steffi Kopp of the police in Thuringia. The moderator and author Birgit von Derschau was honored in 2000 as Honorary Criminal Commissioner, in 2002 as Honorary Chief Criminal Commissioner and in 2011 as Honorary Chief Criminal Commissioner. She is an honorary member of the Federation of German Criminal Investigators. Since the beginning of broadcasting, the audience has risen to the top of the reach of regional TV. Thus, Kripo live has become one of the most successful formats of German television. On 27 June 1999, Dieter Zurwehme was searched for the murderer and a caller alone, due to the characteristics of the \\"backpack and walking stick\\", suspected of the significantly different-looking pensioner Friedhelm Beate, who was then shot dead by civilian guards. The 1000th broadcast was broadcast on April 10, 2011. On 5 September 2013, the MDR announced that Birgit von Derschau would be replaced by Axel Bulthaupt from 6 October 2013. In addition, the studio moved from Dresden to Leipzig. Under Bulthaupt, the program for the criminal-technical documentation is being redesigned and there is an investigation and laboratory area, where Bulthaupt recreates the individual cases.

The series is about a policeman from the 1980s put into a modern police department in Essen.  Plot  The plot revolves around German homicide detective Mick Brisgau, who was shot in the head on duty in the late 1980s. As a result of this head shot, he was in a coma for 20 years. The show starts when he awakes suddenly from said coma. Being a star for the media he is allowed to return to his old job at the homicide department. As an old- school macho-cop, he doesn't know about modern technology (e.g., cellphones, computers, modern investigation methods) and deals with modern world homicide cases in his 1980s-style manner, thus making him a unique officer in Essen police headquarters in the center of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region. While spectators might find resemblances with Life on Mars, it is actually doing the inverse; the rough style of the main character (portrayed by Henning Baum) is complemented by his prudent partner Andreas Kringge (portrayed by Maximilian Grill). The series presents a number of 1980s music and items, such as the main character driving an old Opel Diplomat V8.http://www.sat1.de/tv/der- letzte-bulle/video/comic (episode 4) The setting includes his old partner from the 1980s, Martin Ferchert, who is now the chief of department, and his former wife, who has married the coroner Roland Meisner, who both serve in the same department. In some episodes his adult daughter, Isabelle, appears, whom he had known only as a baby. Amongst the social problems, police psychologist Tanja Haffner tries to conciliate. Production and transmission The series ran first on 12 April 2010 on Sat.1 Television with 2.99 million viewers (or 9.2 percent) somewhat below the average of the TV channel. However viewer share increased especially among younger viewers. With the start of the second season, the viewer share almost doubled and Sat.1 ordered a third season. The fourth season aired in Germany beginning 21 January 2013. The show has been aired in combination with the Sat.1 production Danni Lowinski from the start, but while the latter scored better in the beginning it is now The Last Cop that shows better results. With a viewer share of 15% for The Last Cop and with the two series being the best-running productions of Sat.1, it was announced on 9 April 2013 that a fifth season was being planned for both shows. The series has been sold to neighbouring countries; it has run on Austrian √ñRF since 31 May 2011. The French Direct 8 has run a dubbed version since March 2012 under the title of Mick Brisgau, le come-back d‚Äôun super flic.

The show premiered on April 26, 1999 on ProSieben. Not a ratings success, rumors about a cancellation rose in the fall of the same year. Slowly Mallorca build a solid audience, but production costs were too high for the network and ProSieben canceled the show in the end of 1999. The last episode was shown in January 2000. The show continued on the channel's schedule through November 2000 in the daytime program, becoming a success in several reruns over the years. Storyline The show follows a group of dropouts, who didn't see a future in Germany and now want to find happiness on the Spanish island Mallorca. Some are try to escape difficult relationships, others want to get away from their family or are running from the law. And some just searching for adventure and love. The focus is put on the ruthless real estate agent Rolf Stein (Klaus Zmorek), whose business activities are not always legal. He lives together with his lover, the former stewardess Kim Ambach (Christine D√∂ring), and his 19-year- old daughter Stefanie (Yvonne Burbach). Rolf also owns the Son Vent Hotel, which his good-hearted brother Volker (Matthias Haase) manages. He lives there together with his wife Christine (Jenny J√ºrgens), his 15-year-old daughter Carina (Luise B√§hr) and his 16-year-old son Lukas (Vinzenz Kiefer).

Eva originally came with Rolf to Mallorca before falling for Ricardo. Barkeeper Jan Keppler (Peter Atanassow) takes on three jobs, working at the Hotel, the Disco El Diagonal and the beach bar.

Here lies his yacht, named after his daughter, which is taken care of by the skippers Marc Osterkamp (Patrick Gr√§ser) and Thomas K√∂hler (Alfonso Losa).

Charisma  The show's host channel had removed the program from its listing because the first episode of the series did not match Pro 7's desired market share. In response to a fan- initiated internet petition, Pro 7 resumed the series at short notice during their 11:15 P.M. slot. Although the later episodes saw more views than the pilot, the ratings were still below the station's target. On November 1, 2005, reruns of the entire season of My New Friend were shown on MTV. Three years later, another repeat ran in early 2008 on Comedy Central. Conclusively, there was a special episode where Christian Ulmen commented on the individual characters he played and candidates he messed with while on the show.  Ulmen.tv  The roles Alexander Von Eich, Knut Hansen and Uwe Woellner and the time on the eleventh of December that he played the corner named Maurice Horstmann have been incorporated into ulmen.tv.

Plot summary The German economic boom of the late 1970s led to an increase of land speculation; taking advantage of this, farmer Josef Hartinger makes a fortune selling his land, and gives up farming, living on the millions he'd earned. Deciding to help his children, he buys out their livelihoods: younger son Martin becomes a beverage distributor, whilst daughter Monica becomes a hairdresser with her own salon. His oldest son, Andreas, however, is a farmer, through and through, and, without any land to farm, he emigrates to Canada. Without Andreas's knowledge, however, his father buys him a farm. Series two primarily concerns Josef Hartinger becoming a local politician, and running for the office of mayor. Production Series one was shot on a farm in Anzing, in 1979; the second series was produced in 1986, and broadcast two years later on ARD. Though the cast remained the same, the filming location changed. Release Pixis Medien released a DVD, containing all the episodes, on October 12, 2007.

It is widely known for its extreme cold hardiness and its slow growth compared to other palmetto species. History The origin of Sabal 'Birmingham' is shrouded in mystery. The plant was first identified with a large palmetto that grew in the garden of Eva Alexander in Birmingham, Alabama (hence the name), which survived many freezes below , including at least one below . One even survived -11 degrees F in Tulsa, OK. Speculation indicates the seed source for this particular palm was somewhere in California. After Alexander's death in 1976, her property on Graymont Avenue was re-purposed for a church, and the tree was moved to the Birmingham Botanical Gardens. It remained there until it died in the mid 1980s. Before its demise, Bob McCartney of Woodlander's Nursery collected seed from the tree and began germinating seedlings, which have kept this particular species going. Specimens are now found as far away as Virginia, Maryland, and southern New Jersey. Description Sabal 'Birmingham' grows up to in height, with a trunk up to diameter. Like Sabal palmetto, it is a distinct fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), with a bare petiole which extends as a center spine or midrib, (costa) 1/2 to 2/3 the length into a rounded, costapalmate fan of numerous leaflets. A costapalmate leaf has a definite costa (midrib) unlike the typical palmate or fan leaf, but the leaflets are arranged radially like in a palmate leaf. All costapalmate leaves are markedly recurved or arched backwards. Each leaf is long, with 40-60 leaflets up to long. It was originally speculated that Sabal birmingham was a hybrid between Sabal palmetto and Sabal mexicana, however its slow growth rate and increased cold hardiness point more toward a hybrid between Sabal palmetto and Sabal minor. Cultivation and uses This palm is in great demand in areas where Sabal palmetto is only marginally hardy because of its lower protection needs. Well- established specimens of Sabal 'Birmingham' are hardy in USDA Zone 7, while Sabal palmetto needs winter protection and near-perfect siting to be successfully grown in any zone colder than Zone 8. Established Sabal 'Birmingham' are grown in or near Atlanta, GA, Raleigh, NC, New Bern, NC, Nashville, TN, Richmond, VA, Washington, DC, Baltimore, MD and Toms River, NJ References Category:Ornamental plant cultivars Birmingham ","title":"Sabal 'Birmingham'"},{"id":"33136743","text":"Mit Herz und Handschellen is a German television series.

He is called \\"Monaco Franze\\" after the Italian name of Munich, Bavaria. M√ºnchinger, played by Helmut Fischer, lives with his wife Annette von Soettingen (Ruth Maria Kubitschek), an antiques shop owner, in Munich-Schwabing in happy marriage. He loves his city and he loves Annette, whom he affectionately calls \\"Spatzl\\". And Annette loves Monaco, even though she does come from a higher social class and regularly socialises with the likes of her, who all despise Monaco because of his apparent lack of education and cultural sophistication. This contrast often leads to humorous situations and dialogues, which are a common feature in the series. Monaco also loves adventure and his greatest passion is the opposite sex. The driving plot of all episodes is Monaco putting great efforts in establishing and maintaining more or less stable relationships with other women, mostly younger ones, of which Annette is well aware. She endures this, knowing her husband truly loves her and only likes to play and cannot be tethered. His best friend Manfred \\"Manni\\" Kopfeck (Karl Obermayr), a former colleague, who still lives a dull life as civil servant, regularly assists his friend in an amusing way to set up these relationships and also to cover them up against Annette. The series still enjoys great popularity especially in Bavaria due to the hilarious portrayal of the characters, the many references to Munich (places, restaurants etc.) and also the dialogues and quotes in Bavarian dialect, some of which have made it into everyday language.

It is a highly caffeinated black coffee served with milk and sugar. This drink originates from Peninsular Malaysia, with Hainanese roots. It is also otherwise known as Nanyang coffee. Nanyang means ‚ÄòSouth Sea‚Äô in Mandarin, and usually references to Southeast Asia. The Singapore coffee is recognized to be culturally significant and part of the everyday diet and lifestyle of many Singaporeans. It is habitual for Singaporeans of all ethnicities and ages to customize their Kopi using the Hokkien dialect. The coffee is also popular in Malaysia. The Singapore coffee is distinct from other types of coffee due to its roasting process and preparation technique involving a variation of the Torrefacto method. It is usually served in coffee shops, hawker centers and kopitiams. There are also many commercial brands that have emerged specializing in serving the traditional coffee with pairings of local fare such as kaya toast and laksa. Concerns over the elevation of diabetes cases, have caused the creation of government-led nationwide campaigns in Singapore to reduce sugar intake, especially with regard to sweet drinks or drinks that add sugar such as Kopi O. This has the potential to affect the consumption of Kopi O. The significance of Kopi in Singapore‚Äôs culture can be found in greater detail in Singapore‚Äôs only Kopi museum.  Etymology  Kopi (pictured in the background, or Kopi O (pictured in the foreground), paired with kaya toast is a popular breakfast option in Singapore. Local Kopi vocabulary governs the way consumers order their preferred style of Kopi in Malaysia and Singapore. The local Kopi vocabulary is grounded in Hokkien dialect. This transcendence of Hokkien dialect into the Kopi culture can be linked to the prominence of Hokkien immigrants in Malaya and Colonial Singapore. According to the history of Chinese immigration, millions of China residents left due to natural calamities and political instability during the 19th Century. In the beginning, 50,000 Chinese landed in Singapore ‚Äì many of them Chinese traders. This number grew to 200,000 in 1900 as more passed through the Malay States and Dutch East Indies into Singapore. Amongst the arrivals, the Hokkiens made up the largest proportion of Chinese dialect groups in Singapore. Thus, they also came to possess a dominant share of the banking, manufacturing and trade industries. Variations in style of Singapore‚Äôs traditional coffee revolve around denseness, sugar level, and additions of evaporated milk, condensed milk or ice. The terms used to order these variations, along with their respective meanings, can be found below. * Kopi: Coffee with sugar and condensed milk * Kopi-O: Coffee with sugar * Kopi-O-Kosong: Coffee without sugar and evaporated milk * Kopi-C: Coffee with sugar and evaporated milk * Kopi-Peng: Iced coffee with sugar and condensed milk * Kopi-Siew-Dai: Coffee with less sugar and condensed milk * Kopi-Siew-Siew-Dai: Coffee with little sugar and condensed milk * Kopi-Ga-Dai: Coffee with extra sugar and condensed milk * Kopi-Gao: Coffee with sugar, condensed milk and extra thick concentrated coffee * Kopi-Di-Lo: Coffee with no dilution * Kopi-Poh: Coffee with extra dilution In addition to local variations, there are also diverse overseas combinations and variations of Kopi. This includes Yuenyeung or Kopi Cham which is a mixture of coffee and tea popular in Malaysia and Hong Kong. Kopi is also otherwise known as Nanyang coffee. Nanyang means ‚ÄòSouth Sea‚Äô in Mandarin, and usually references to Southeast Asia.  History  = Arrival in Colonial Singapore = The origin of Kopi in Singapore is intertwined with the demographic, industrial and cultural history of Colonial Singapore. In 1821, the Hainanese arrived in Singapore to trade medicinal herbs, umbrellas and wax amongst other things. They did not immigrate to Singapore until much later in the 1870s due to conservative attitudes and delayed open trade and seafaring activities. This left the Hainanese at an employment disadvantage compared to earlier arrivals like the Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese, whom had already entrenched themselves into industries like commerce and agriculture, due to aid from exclusivist clan associations. The Hainanese were a small group, unable to communicate easily with other Chinese groups due to dialect differences and were both illiterate and poor. These circumstances forced them into the service sector, where they found work as rubber tapers, waiters, and more popularly, cooks and domestic servants in rich European and Peranakan households. From the late 1920s to early 1930s, the economic downturn incentivized the Hainanese to turn to the hotel, bar and restaurant landscape due to lower rental rates. The competition from Cantonese single women immigrants and reduction of British and Peranakan families after World War II also impacted the viability of remaining in the services sector. Thus, the Hainanese relied upon their culminated culinary and personal service skills, and increasingly ventured into setting up their own coffeeshops or kopitiams from the 1920s to 1950s. The support from the Hainanese association members aided this successful transition.Low, C. G. (1983). Chinese Dialect Groups. On Oral History Centre [MP3]. Singapore: National Archives of Singapore. It is recognized that the Hainanese community played a pioneering and pivotal role in the emergence of the kopitiam culture in Singapore. It was through these Hainanese kopitiams that distinctive techniques of roasting coffee beans and brewing coffee were created, and Kopi along with its variations in Singapore was birthed. = Events of influence = During the Japanese Occupation, black market traders often used coffee shops to sell rice, salt and sugar to the public. By mid-1944, tighter restrictions and increased scarcity forced most coffee shops to close. The remaining only offered Kopi without sugar and milk. This meant consumption and availability of Kopi O greatly reduced. Key events also shaped the Kopi landscape in late 1900s Singapore, affecting the price, availability and consumption. The rapid trend of buying kopitiams in Singapore began in 1988. A direct effect of a change in policy, that enabled privatization of ownership of kopitiams previously under the Housing Development Board. Kopitiams became attractive property investments. This caused the prices of kopitiam properties for sale and resale to rise sharply. The result also encompassed the practice of selling new purchases to another owner, who would then renovate the place to justify increased rents onto the tenants. Another pattern of holding the kopitiam for short periods of time and selling them off to make money quickly also emerged. The overarching economic result directly impacting stallholders and consumers, was an exponential growth in food and rent prices. Examples included increases of rent by S$1000, a 30% to 70% hike in prices of dishes, and a close to 100% increase in price for a cup of Kopi. In 2006, the price of a Kopi O rose from 60 cents to 70 cents. Similarly, in 2016, due to increased rent and labor costs, kopi prices rose from $1 to $1.30, which caused unhappiness in patrons. The reactions of the public towards raised Kopi prices ‚Äì writing complaint letters to The Straits Times and involving The Consumers Association of Singapore ‚Äì serve as evidence with regard to the constant of Kopi in Singapore‚Äôs food culture and the integral role it plays in the everyday lifestyles of Singapore residents.  Processing  = Beans and sources = Un-roasted robusta beans Kopi traditionally uses Robusta coffee beans. During Colonial Singapore, the Chinese partook in exchanges with Arab traders who carried with them Indonesian Robusta beans, and these beans grew better in Singapore‚Äôs conditions as opposed to Arabica beans. The common type of Robusta beans used in Singapore is the Indonesia EK-1 species. In 21st Century Singapore, Robusta beans continue to be largely imported from Indonesia and Vietnam. In a bid to modernize, heritage brands such as Lam Yeo Coffee Powder Factory choose to use gourmet beans from South Africa and Central America. = Roasting = The general traditional preparation process for Hainanese-style Kopi involves using a combination of 80% beans, 20% sugar and margarine in the roasting process for a duration of 25 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius. Halfway into the roasting time, salt is added. Sugar is also added at the end to provide a caramelized finish and takeaway any bitter aftertaste. The result is a richer and more fragrant coffee than Western-style coffee. This method has been said to hold slight similarities to the common Torrefacto roasting method in Argentina, Costa Rica, France, Portugal and Spain. = Serving = To serve, the grinded Kopi powder is placed in a muslin bag and boiling water is poured over it. It is then stirred using a long stick or chopstick. After, the brew is transferred back and forth between two large cylindrical kettles with upright tubular spouts tapering to the pouring end. The purpose is to aerate and cool the Kopi. = Nutrition = Kopi has twice the amount of caffeine found in Arabica coffee. A regular cup of Kopi contains three teaspoons of sugar whereas Kopi-Siew-Dai has 1.5 teaspoons. The World Health Organization recommends that an optimal sugar intake would border 5 teaspoons to bring about health benefits. = Instant Kopi = The instant coffee market in Singapore is set to grow annually by 3.1% according to Statista. In 2016 and 2017, the movement against Diabetes negatively impacted sales numbers. This occurred alongside the growing appeal of coffee pods to consumers in Singapore. One of the major contributing factors towards this trend, is the ability to control the amount of sugar and creamer used. National brands such as Toast Box produce their own instant Kopi products. Instant Kopi can also be found in local supermarkets. The brands which provide traditional Kopi variations such as Kopi-O include Old Town, OWL, Gold Kili, Aik Cheong and Ah Huat. = Modern variations = Younger generations of Singaporeans have created modern twists and recipes involving Kopi. An example is Coffee Break at Amoy Street that offers Almond Ginger Kopi which embodies a spicy and nutty flavor. This depicts an existing progression away from the traditional methods of preparing Kopi in Singapore.  Sale and distribution  = Consumer market = Hawker Center, Singapore In Singapore there are an estimated 322 coffee shops and hundreds of them are found in the HDB estates. This is alongside hundreds of food courts and hawker centers. Almost all of them, selling Singapore Kopi and its many variations. The established coffee shops include Tong Ah Eating House in Chinatown that has passed down four generations, Killiney kopitiam that has received a heritage award, Heap Seng Leong ‚Äì one of the few traditional coffee shops serving Kopi with butter, and Ah Seng Coffee that began in the 1960s. There are also commercialized outlets that specialize in the Singapore traditional breakfast and Kopi. The household names include: * Ya Kun, a Hainanese business that began in 1944. The chain is largely seen as culturally significant to Singaporean life and is also recognized for its kaya toast. * Toast Box, that integrates heritage items into its d√©cor and is known for their butter mountain display. It also conducts Nanyang coffee appreciation workshops. * and Nanyang Old Coffee, conceptualised in the 1940s and winner of ‚ÄòThe Search for The Best Coffee Competition 2013‚Äô. The brand also runs workshops. An initiative by NTUC Foodfare and Kopitiam that began in 2019, continues to provide Kopi at discounted prices of $0.50 for Singaporeans part of the Pioneer and Merdeka generations, and the NTUC Union. A regular cup of Kopi usually costs around $0.90 to $1.60 at Kopitiam outlets.  Society and culture  = Consumption (Colonial Singapore) = During the early 1900s, porcelain cups were typically used to serve the Kopi. These cups were decorated by the motifs or logos of the coffee suppliers. Consumers would cool their Kopi by pouring it into the saucer and then drinking from it. In the 1930s, some coffee roasters would use opium-infused water to roast their beans in order to make customers addicted to their brew. There was also a practice of warming cold coffee in ceramic cups on a charcoal burner, to give the impression that the coffee was freshly made. Blue-collared workers began to drink coffee instead of tea due to its stronger caffeine effect. More than 80% of the coffee-shops were run by Hainanese and Foochows, but they were often patronized by members of other communities such as Malays and Indians. The main consumers of Kopi at these coffee-shops were men. This was partly due to the small population of women immigrants, and the cultural expectation for them to remain at home or in their quarters. Another reason was the nature of kopitiams in Colonial Singapore, which served as recreation venues for men, gambling dens, and meeting places for secret society members. The prevalence of prostitutes and escort girls at the kopitiams also discouraged women from sitting around. = Consumption (Modern Singapore) = Kopi makes up over 70% of the coffee consumed in 21st Century Singapore. People from all income brackets, gender, age and communities can be found drinking the widely available Kopi ‚Äì with some enjoying 4 to 6 cups a day. The original ceramic cups have been widely replaced by glass at many coffee shops. In hawker centers, the takeaway option is served in a plastic bag. This beverage is often paired with a traditional Singapore breakfast which consists of kaya and butter on charcoal-grilled toast, paired with two soft-boiled eggs. Kaya is an egg jam combined with milk and sugar. The Hainanese version is brown in color due to the use of caramelized sugar. The Peranakan version is instead green in color due to the infusion of pandan leaves. Both types are equally prevalent in Singapore. The breakfast holds links to the British style of breakfast and was popularized by the Hainanese. = Health = In 2016, Singapore launched a nationwide campaign to tackle Diabetes. A survey conducted by YouGov found that 42% of Singaporeans were supportive of a sugar tax in Singapore whereas 58% would favor a ban. The attitudes of Singaporeans towards sugar has a direct impact on their preference of Kopi, since Kopi O involves addition of sugar. The 2018 healthier drinks policy has created mandatory guidelines for many food and beverage outlets, putting a control on the sugar content. Coffee shop operator Kopitiam has also started the practice of serving sugar-free beverages, and leaving the sugar at the side of stalls for customers to add for themselves. A trial conducted at the Health Promotion Board‚Äôs public canteen saw a 75% drop in the amount of sugar used, when the self-help practice was implemented. With 430,000 Singaporeans with diabetes in 2018, the dwindling appeal of Kopi O shows potential of being a long-term constant. = Events and competitions = Singapore coffee-related events: * The Singapore Coffee Festival \\\\- Organized by the Straits Times and supported by DBS. \\\\- Held on 4th to 6th August \\\\- Consists of merchants ranging from cafes to retail shops and workshops. * Singapore Coffee Auction \\\\- Organized by the Singapore Coffee Association (SCA) for farmers to promote their coffee beans to the regional and Singapore market. * Specialty Coffee and Tea Asia \\\\- Organized by Montgomery Asia Pte Ltd \\\\- A convention for all supply chain participants in the coffee and tea industry to congregate, showcase and network Singapore coffee-related competitions: * Singapore National Barista Championship * Singapore National Brewers Cup * Singapore Coffee in Good Spirits Championship * Singapore Cup Tasters Championship = Museum = The Nanyang Old Coffee Mini Singapore Coffee Museum is Singapore‚Äôs sole museum dedicated to Kopi history. It traces the traditional roasting methods and features photographs, vintage items, and information regarding the Kopi landscape in Singapore, as well as those who partake in creating it. An example of an interesting tidbit of information is how empty condensed milk cans were reused as takeaway containers.

Located on the left internal wall of the church, it pairs the adjacent fresco of Equestrian Statue of John Hawkwood by Paolo Uccello (1436). Description The work is a fresco painted in monochrome to emulate a marble statue. The condottiero, the Italian Niccol√≤ da Tolentino is depicted riding his horse, standing on a classical pedestal painted in geometrical perspective, and flanked by two nude men with coat of arms. The horse and the rider are painted in a different perspective than the pedestal. The horse (differently from the species' walking pattern) is portrayed while raising both left legs. It is a large and massive animal, inspired by the head of the ancient Riccardi Horse and to Donatello's Equestrian statue of Gattamelata, a prototype of Renaissance equestrian statues. Andrea del Castagno had studied this earlier statue through drawings, never visiting its location in the city of Padua in Veneto. As in Donatello's sculpture, the condottiero stares down the onlooker, to emphasize his power, command and determination in battle. The elegant hat and the flittering cloak area examples of the increasing taste for fine decorative elements in Florentine art, in contrast with the more austere fresco of John Hawkwood by Uccello completed some 30 years earlier.Uccello's use of horsemen in paintings is also on display in his painting of the Battle of San Romano.

The series was created by, and is produced and presented by Klaus-J√ºrgen Deuser. The series made its TV debut on 14 October 2001 on WDR TV; it had existed as a live show since 2000. From 2007 until October 2009, it was broadcast on Comedy Central, and since November 2009 it has been aired on digital channel Einsfestival. The original series was set in a coin-operated laundrette in the Belgian quarter of Cologne.  History  NightWash began as a live show in 2000. Aside from the laundrette scenario, the unusual name is also a reference to the name of the rock band Nightwish. Deuser was influenced in choosing the format of the show by his experiences in the New York City comedy scene. The window sill was a stage, with the audience sitting on the benches, which were usually in front of the washing machines. In the show's original version, Deuser stood on a platform next to tumble dryers. Often, unsuspecting customers or passers-byers were incorporated into the program with a comedian. NightWash was initially shown from 2001 to 2006 on WDR television and Das Erste (one series, October 2003). From 18 January 2007 to October 2009, the show was broadcast on Germany' Comedy Central Germany. From 30 September 2007, the television programs were initially recorded in Cologne's Gloria-Theater. Deuser explained at the beginning of the first episode of the new series that the laundry had closed for economic reasons. In spite of the new venue, most of the known elements from the laundrette format were retained.

It normally appears in screen-based media, and in particular title sequences, TV station idents, and advertising. Within the field of typography, letterforms typically embody either static or kinetic forms. However there is another category of typography that escapes the purely static or purely kinetic. Unlike static typography, these forms are not bound by one iteration within a singular viewing experience. Similar to kinetic type, temporal typography carries the stamp of time but is not relegated movement or time-based media. Temporal letterforms have the ability to manifest themselves in both static and kinetic ways, as well as physical and digital ways, and therefore cannot be evaluated by the same functional factors of traditional typography: legibility and readability. Viewership and perception are elevated, and formal and experiential conditions are re-prioritized as the forms transition from one state to the next.Brownie, Barbara.

It is based on the fictional character Pumuckl created by Ellis Kaut. It is a sequel series to 1980s TV series Meister Eder und sein Pumuckl (Master [carpenter] Eder and his Pumuckl) and the cinematic movie Pumuckl und der blaue Klabauter (Pumuckl and the blue Klabauter). Gustl Bayrhammer, who played Meister Eder in the first series, died in 1993; rather than recast his role, the producers decided to feature characters which had been introduced in the movie, making the movie sort of a pilot to this series, bridging the gap between the events of first series and this one.  Plot  The show centers around the Kobold Pumuckl, a descendant of the Klabauterm√§nner. He is invisible to people around him except for chef Odessi (Towje Kleiner) with whom Pumuckl lives, since he left his friend master carpenter Eder (Gustl Bayrhammer) during the events of the 1994 cinematric movie Pumuckl und der blaue Klabauter (Pumuckl and the blue Klabauter).  Characters  * Pumuckl is the main protagonist of the series. He is invisible when other people than Odessi are around. He is still very cheeky and immature. * Odessi is now, after Meister Eder's death, the only human who is able to see Pumuckl. He is a chef on a ship. He is usually is from Munich, but decided to go to the sea. He also loves singing. His parents are from Sicily so he speaks Italian fluently and also sings all of his songs in Italian. His slogan is \\"Es kommt, wie es kommen muss.\\" (\\"It comes as it must\\"). * Willibald is an older mariner and Willibald's best human friend. He strictly believes in the position of the stars, a bit like Mrs. Eichinger from the first two seasons. He first does not believe in Pumuckl's existence, but after Pumuckl keeps untying his shoelace, he has to admit that he does exist. He also has a parrot called Lilalora, however, she is only able to say her name as well as \\"Aye aye Kapit√§n!\\" He quickly starts to like Pumuckl and when Odessi leaves, he is very upset and asks Odessi if he at least could leave Pumuckl on the ship, however, Pumuckl decides to stay with Odessi. One of his biggest wishes is to be able to see Pumuckl. So, in the end, Odessi decides to make a photo of Pumuckl. However, even on the photo he is only visible to Odessi, but not to Willibald. Willibald is very disappointed about that. He is performed by Wolfgang V√∂lz * Paul is the ship's helmsman and operator. He is very keen in electronic stuff and even built an alarm system for the ship. He also loves taking photos. However, his weakness is his arrogance and impatience. Unlike Willibald, he refuses to believe in klabauters until the end. In the end however, even he gets emotional when Odessi leaves and hugs him. * Peter is the ship's captain. His first name gets revealed in the seventh episode. He has a daughter and granddaughter in Paris. He is performed by Hans Clarin, who also voices Pumuckl. * Corinna is Odessi's girlfriend. He met her in Hamburg. Her widowed grandma lives near the Tegernsee. * Hanno is Corinna's older brother. When Odessi first sees him, he thinks he is Corinna's boyfriend.

Rel√§xx was a weekly kids- and youth magazine that was broadcast on KI.KA from 1997 to 2008. Between 1997 and 2006 it was produced by UFA Entertainment GmbH and since 2007 by X Film- und Fernsehproduktion GmbH on behalf of the German television channel rbb.  The programme  Rel√§xx was a leisure-time programme for kids and teenagers. Each episode lasted 20 minutes (previously 15 minutes) and had a different key subject. There was a wide range of topics. Beside background reports about e.g. the festival Berlinale, the programme also showed portraits of young actors and as well reportages on special sports. There were reports like ‚ÄúF√§nn-Kursen‚Äù and ‚Äú√Ñxxclusiv‚Äù and furthermore there were the two pretty unconventional actors Professor Dr. Marcowitsch (played by von Langenbeck himself) and M.C. Matzke (played by Kathrin Matzke, who also played this self- created role in the last episodes of the youth programme elf99). Both characters made the programme more relaxed with the help of comedy. The trend- magazine was presented with a new design and in 16:9 widescreen format since its 500. episode in September 2007. As well as the title song, which was changed from ‚ÄúFrankie Goes To Hollywood‚Äù to Mika‚Äôs song ‚ÄúRelax, Take It Easy‚Äù. A Labrador-dog called ‚ÄúM√§xx‚Äù was as well a part of the programme since its relaunch. Since 2009 the programme was cancelled.  Awards  The programme received the award ‚ÄúGoldener Spatz‚Äù four times. In 2008, Rel√§xx received this award for the best entertaining performance. The programme had received the award for entertainment already in 1999. Karsten Blumenthal received in the same year the special award for individual achievement and innovation as well as the award for moderation. The same award was handed out to him again in 2011.
