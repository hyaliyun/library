Set in the mid-18th century, the novel follows the picaresque adventures of James Dyer, an Englishman born without the ability to feel pain or pleasure. It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction, the International Dublin Literary Award and the Italian Premio Grinzane Cavour prize for a foreign language novel. The novel was also listed on the New York Times \\"Notable Books of the Year\\" for 1997. Plot The novel opens in 1771 with the autopsy of James Dye by two gentleman surgeons keen on understanding the deceased's famed inability to feel physical pain. The pair had been given access to the corpse by the Reverend Lestrade, hunting enthusiast and vicar to a country parish. The story then rewinds to the night of James's conception on a midwinter night in 1739 when his mother is raped by a stranger while skating at night. She gives birth to an infant whose failure to cry immediately creeps everyone out. Against all expectations the baby lives, growing up to be a mute boy with an inordinately precocious countenance that disconcerts everyone, foremost of all his schoolteacher, a crippled spinster who prides herself on being an expert on children. James is discovered to be incapable of feeling pain following a fall from the top of the tree. Shortly after he surprises everyone by speaking. While recuperating from the fall an outbreak of smallpox kills his mother and two siblings, leaving him alone with his older sister Liza, the only person who has any affection for him, and his mother's distraught husband, Joshua, an impoverished yeoman. Already something of a habitual drunkard, Joshua gives himself completely to alcoholism in his grief, ultimately killing himself. James immediately departs for Bristol, leaving his Liza, who has been rendered blind by smallpox, to an undetermined fate. James searches out Marley Gummer, a veteran conman and huckster who had been among the men to rescue James from his fall and the first to note James's unusual nature. Gummer takes the young boy under his wing, training him to mimic train and suffering. Once James has perfected his screams, they set out to tour the country fair circuit in England, peddling a quack nostrum touted as capable of warding off pain. It is at one of these acts that James catches the attention of a gentleman by the name of Canning, a collector of freaks and patron of artists. James understands Canning's overtures and willingly acquiesces to being kidnapped away from Gummer, who is beaten up by men in the employ of Canning. James finds himself being housed on a vast country estate, where he is largely left to his own devices. At night he wanders the seemingly endless corridors of Canning's manor house, encountering a librarian, a painter, and a pair of Siamese twins. Thanks to the librarian he is given access to a near- inexhaustible supply of anatomy books, from the painter the ability to finetune drawing (a skill he had picked up in his earlier childhood), and from the twins his first experience of sexual intercourse. Canning is revealed to be a member of the Royal Society and an enthusiast of science. He takes James to London where the boy is subjected to experimentation in front of an audience of Canning's peers, who are all wowed by James's indifference to stabbings. Meanwhile the Siamese twins die as a result of an awry attempt to surgically separate them; James is the only one unmoved by the blood- splattered carnage that accompanies the event. Gummer reappears and kidnaps James at gunpoint. This is shortly after James has discovered that Canning is a hermaphrodite. The reunited duo return to Bristol, where Gummer immediately embarks on a drinking spree to celebrate the boy's return. Any hopes of a return to the days of Gummer's successful quackery are put to an immediate end, however, when James allows for the two of them to be pressganged into the royal navy. Onboard the ship James develops a reputation for efficiency and fearlessness. These qualities enable him to become assistant to naval surgeon Robert Munro. James discreetly engineers Munro's ouster by enabling his drinking. James is appointed Munro's replacement and distinguishes himself in action against the French during the battle for Minorca. James eventually departs naval service to become a medical student, accompanied by Gummer, who by now has become his manservant. His studies over, he searches out Munro, who has settled in Bath with a young pretty wife. James moves in with the married couple and proceeds to establish their medical practice as the most sought in the city. The surgeons' wealth expands in accordance with their increasing popularity among the aristocracy. This period of prosperity proves fleeting, however, because Munro's wife Agnes soon falls for James. The extramarital affair drives Munro to suicide, which in turn causes both Agnes and James to be ostracised. With his practice snubbed and his clinic periodically falling prey to vandalism by the city's outraged denizens, James opts to participate in a race among other English doctors to inoculate Empress Catherine of Russia. Against the odds, he fails to win the race, having been waylaid by a snowstorm and abandoned by Gummer. James falls into a stupor and loses his sanity. James is subsequently shipped back from Saint Petersburg and incarcerated in Bedlam, where he is subjected to many beatings. It is during this time that he discovers sensation, feeling both pain and pleasure. Reception Critics praised Miller's evocative prose, thorough research and precise pacing. Sarah Broadhurst in a review for Lovereading stated that the book was a \\"very skilful, densely written, complicated novel\\" and stated that it was \\"challenging and intelligent, it is a rewarding read.\\" Publishers Weekly called the novel \\"inventive\\", \\"steeped with specific details\\" and \\"beautifully controlled\\". In a review for The Independent, Josie Barnard praised the tone of the novel, stating \\"Ambivalence is one of Miller's strengths. He enfolds the reader in the present tense and wields his writing style as coolly and precisely as a scalpel.\\" and also praised his descriptions of the 18th century, stating that \\"Miller's evocation of the period is thorough. Many of his sentences speak paragraphs, his paragraph pages. Ingenious Pain is a book that gives visceral pleasure.\\", calling the novel as a whole \\"sensational\\". It was again reviewed by The Independent a year later by Lilian Pizzichini who opined that Millers \\"understanding of contemporary mores is thorough, the period detail precisely evoked, and his characters come alive with flashes of humour and compassion.\\" Patrick Mcgrath writing for the New York Times was particularly effusive in his praise, calling the novel \\"peculiar\\", \\"colorful\\" and \\"complicated\\"; an \\"extraordinary first novel\\". He also praises Millers research, writing that \\"he writes a fine strong prose thickly larded with the sights, sounds and smells of the period\\". He also praises the pacing of the novel; and draws comparison to John Fowles's novel The French Lieutenant's Woman; Graham Swift's Waterland; and Peter Ackroyd's \\"early flamboyant historical pastiches.\\" References Category:1997 British novels Category:Novels set in Russia Category:British bildungsromans Category:Novels by Andrew Miller Category:Sceptre (imprint) books ","title":"Ingenious Pain"},{"id":"33925022","text":"J.

He originally studied Classics as an undergraduate student at Oxford, before switching his attention to Zoology under the guidance of W. F. R. Weldon at University College London . He also travelled to Utrecht in the Netherlands, to work with Hubrecht, and was exposed to new methods and approaches in embryology.

It was described in 1971, and is believed to be the county's only endemic species. It grows up to long, with 4–6 black eyespots, and has a long eversible proboscis. Distribution The only site where P. jenningsi has ever been found is a former clay pit now used for recreational fishing between Bretherton and Croston in Chorley borough, Lancashire. It was discovered there in 1967, and described by Ray Gibson and Johnstone O. Young in 1971. It is thought to be the only species endemic to Lancashire. Prior to the discovery of P. jenningsi, there had only been four reports of freshwater nemerteans in the British Isles, in the River Cherwell at Oxford, the River Cam at Cambridge, a tank in Regent's Park, London, and the Grand Canal at Clondalkin, County Dublin. Description Prostoma jenningsi is a slender worm, with an elliptical cross-section. Young animals are translucent white, but take on a yellowish hue as they age, eventually becoming \\"dark yellowish or pale reddish-brown\\". They are long when they hatch, reach their adult colouration above and can reach up to long as adults. P. jenningsi has 4–6 black eyespots on the top of the head, The eversible proboscis is two-thirds to three-quarters of the body length, and is armed with one central stylet and paired pouches each containing 2–5 accessory stylets. P. jenningsi is one of eleven species in the genus Prostoma, and can only be told from related species by dissection. Uniquely, it has eleven nerves innervating the proboscis, rather than nine or ten, as seen in other species. The specific epithet ' commemorates J. B. Jennings of the University of Leeds, a scientist who studied invertebrate digestive physiology. No taxonomic synonyms are recognised. Ecology Prostoma jenningsi lives among the vegetation at the edges of the pond, including the plant species Juncus effusus, Elodea canadensis, Myriophyllum spicatum, Phragmites communis, Potamogeton natans and Typha latifolia. Its numbers vary in an annual cycle, with smallest numbers when vegetation growth is highest.

Definition The random variable X\\\\\\\\! has a gamma distribution with shape parameter r and rate parameter \\\\lambda if its probability density function is : f^{}_X(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^r}{\\\\Gamma(r)}\\\\,e^{-\\\\lambda x} x^{r-1}~~~~~~(x>0;\\\\,\\\\lambda,r>0) and this fact is denoted by X\\\\sim\\\\Gamma(r,\\\\lambda)\\\\\\\\!.

The uniqueness of each shape parameter comes without loss of generality, because any case where some of the \\\\lambda_j are equal would be treated by first adding the corresponding variables: this sum would have a gamma distribution with the same rate parameter and a shape parameter which is equal to the sum of the shape parameters in the original distributions.

Life  Otto III was the only son of Duke Joachim I \\"the Younger\\" of Pomerania, ruler of Pomerania- Stettin, and his wife Elizabeth of Brandenburg. After his father died in 1451, his mother married again in 1453, with Duke Wartislaw X of Pomerania-Wolgast. The young Otto, heir of Pomerania-Stettin, was educated at the court of the Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg (1413–1471), his uncle and guardian. When Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania-Wolgast died in 1457, his will named not only his sons Eric II and Wartislaw X, Otto's stepfather, as heir, but also young Otto III. An inheritance dispute arose, is which Frederick II supported Otto, and also used the opportunity to meddle in the affairs of Pomerania. In 1460, Otto III was declared an adult, at the request of the Estates of Pomerania. This ended the regency by Brandenburg; instead the 15-year-old Otto III took up government himself. The most important offices in his court were occupied by Brandenburg-minded people. The disputes about the inheritance of Warislaw IX were settled in 1463, with Otto receiving Pomerania-Stargard, the western part of Pomerania. Otto died of the plague on 7 September 1464 and was buried in the Otten Church in Stettin. He was unmarried and had no children. With his death, the Pomerania-Stettin line of the House of Griffins died out. It had begun with Duke Otto I (-1344). Otto's death triggered the Stettin War of Succession. Elector Frederick II claimed that Pomerania-Stettin was now a completed fief and that it should fall back to Brandenburg. The Dukes in Wolgast claimed that it was a part of Pomerania and should fall to the surviving line of the House of Griffins. According to legend, the dispute began when Otto was buried. Mayor Albert Glinde of Stettin is said to have put Otto's helmet and shield in his grave, to indicate the end of his dynasty. A gentleman from Eickstädt then jumped into the grave and took the helmet and shield out again, with the words \\"We still have hereditary, born rulers, the Dukes in Wolgast.

The current church was built in the 12th century and in the 14th century the south aisle was added. The nave clerestory and timber-framed porch were added in either the late 15th or early 16th century. The monks of the Ruxox Cell acted as priest for the church until the Dissolution of the Monasteries when the abbott of Dunstable Priory surrendered to the king. Rebuilding in 1835 included the dismantling and reassembly of the Norman doorway in the north wall of the nave. During the second half of the 19th century further restoration was undertaken including a new roof on the chancel. The chapter house was added in 1983. The parish and benefice of Flitwick is within the Diocese of St Albans. Architecture The ironstone building has ashlar dressings and clay tile roofs. It consists of the chancel, nave with north and south aisles, south porch, and vestry on the north side. The three-stage west tower is supported by buttresses and has an embattled parapet. The tower has a ring of seven bells, five of which date from the seventeenth century. The font is Norman and has a circular fluted bowl. The pulpit is part of what was originally a three-decker.

In parallel, BeIN Media Group was incorporated and became the official owner of beIN Sports. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was then appointed chairman and chief executive officer of beIN Media Group. beIN Sports has 22 channels including 17 HD channels and broadcasts across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, North America, Australia and Asia.

Qatar Sports Investments Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been chairman of Qatar Sports Investments (QSi) from June 2011. QSi is a fund dedicated to investments in the sport and leisure industry on a national and international level.

As part of the long term plan for the club, Al-Khelaïfi brought in former footballer Leonardo as the new director of football.PSG.FR : Liste des présidents Although Al-Khelaifi had initially demanded a major trophy haul for the 2011–12 season, PSG were soon eliminated from the UEFA Europa League and both domestic cups, leaving the team only able to compete $130 million on players, PSG failed to dominate, and lost out to eventual winners Montpellier, though they did qualify for the UEFA Champions League by finishing second. Zlatan Ibrahimović unveiled by Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo (right) and President Nasser Al-Khelaifi (left) In the 2012–13 season, PSG won the Ligue 1 title and also made it to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League, thanks partly to the goalscoring of newly signed striker, Zlatan Ibrahimović. They eventually lost in a two-legged tie to Barcelona on away goals. In the 2013–14 season PSG again finished top of Ligue 1 with a record total of 89 points. They reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League where they lost to Chelsea 3–3 on aggregate, again going out only on the away goals rule.

In March 2019, he is placed under the status of witness assisted by the French courts. On 23 May 2019, he was indicted for active bribery in an investigation into the 2017 and 2019 Doha nominations for the World Championships in Athletics. \\"These facts do not concern him\\", pleads his lawyer who believes that Nasser Al-Khelaïfi is innocent. In February 2020, Swiss prosecutors dropped the charge of bribery but indicted Al-Khelaifi for inciting Jérôme Valcke “to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement.\\" On 27 March 2020, the Swiss Federal Court rejected the prosecution’s indictment against Al-Khelaifi for inciting Jérôme Valcke to commit criminal mismanagement, stating that \\"These conditions of mismanagement are absent from the OAG's [Swiss prosecution's] accusation\\". On 14 September 2020, the Swiss Federal Court started to prosecute Al-Khelaifi, due to \\"aggravated criminal mismanagement\\", based on charges related to a meeting on October 24, 2013, at the French headquarters of beIN, in which Al-Khelaifi allegedly promised to purchase a villa in Sardinia for €5m, to be utilized by Valcke, in exchange to granting the 2026 and 2030 World Cups screening rights to beIN Media.

Curriculum As the most academically rigorous institution in Albania, the Albanian International School (AIS) curriculum adheres to the Common Core Standards developed in the United States with slight modifications to accommodate the international nature of our school. To ensure all students are ready for success after high school, the Common Core Standards establish clear, consistent guidelines for what every student should know and be able to do in math, English language arts, and history from kindergarten through 9th grade. The Common Core standards focus on developing the critical-thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills students will need to be successful. The standards also provide a way for teachers to measure student progress throughout the school year and ensure that students are on the pathway to success in their academic careers. Forty-two states, the District of Columbia, four territories, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) have voluntarily adopted the standards.  Academics  The Albanian International School utilizes the NWEA MAP Growth evaluation for student growth assessment. AIS remains the only international school in Tirana to both test and publicly share its students international test scores. The Albanian International School is also the first and only school in the Balkans to utilize Standards Based Grading (SBG) for its English and Math class assessments. SBG refers to systems of instruction, assessment, grading, and academic reporting that are based on students demonstrating understanding or mastery of the knowledge and skills they are expected to learn as they progress through their education. left  Facilities  The school is centrally located on the outskirts of downtown Tirana and is housed in the former French Embassy. The building was substantially renovated and improved over the last two years with small improvements ongoing. AIS has recently expanded the kindergarten classroom, added to the cafeteria, added a master fire alarm system, added an external emergency stairwell, added surveillance cameras, instructional technology to accommodate the MAP testing, and two main entry office spaces. The outdoor space fills one side of a city block directly across from the US Embassy, with high stucco walls topped with wrought-iron fencing surrounding the perimeter, with two large gates for vehicles to pass through. The perimeter defines a U-shaped, paved driveway that loops around the building allowing easy access for parents to enter and exit when picking up their children. There is a large outdoor playing field covered with artificial turf and enclosed with chain-link fencing all around and netting over the top. This field is fitted for soccer, basketball and volleyball. Outside next to the playing court is a small playground for preschool with swings, slides, playhouse, and other pre-school equipment. The school is licensed by the Ministry of Education and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Albanian Ministry of Education for education, health safety, and labor regulations.

It was across the street from an H-E-B location that was, as of 1998, being remodeled. In addition the future of the Mexican peso as a currency was uncertain. Also the Government of Mexico enforced a $50 import limit upon Mexicans returning into Mexico, affecting La Fiesta's business among Mexican national shoppers. Because of the issues involving Mexico and competition from H-E-B, the Eagle Pass La Fiesta store was closed. it was the only location ever closed in the history of La Fiesta.

The orchestra plays both contemporary and classical music. Among others, the orchestra has performed with renowned soloists such as Joshua Bell, Sarah Chang, Avi Avital and Danjulo Ishizaka.  About the orchestra  The orchestra’s peculiarity of style is the creation and performance of innovative concert programs. Each concert abounds in samples of contemporary and classical music.  Activity  Tetiana Kalinichenko The troop was assembled in 2007 by Tatiana Kalinichenko (its conductor) in partnership with Andrii Rizol (the Chief Executive PR/BTL/EVENT/ART of «Babilon»). The orchestra’s international activity was initiated by Evgenii Utkin, investment IT-holding «KM Core» president, and the «Master Class» house of arts and education founder. The New Era Orchestra is a long-time participant of major cultural events in Ukraine and abroad: GOGOLFEST multidisciplinary modern art festival, «MOLODIST» international film festival, JAZZ IN KIEV international jazz festival, contemporary music festival in «Arsenal», G AIDA international contemporary music festival (Lithuania) and others. The orchestra is no newbie at conquering foreign public. Kyiv – Paris – Moscow tour (2010) was an international project of a large scale. It was devoted to Andrei Tarkovsky, who was one of the most prominent filmmakers of all times. In Ukraine, the New Era Orchestra was the first to perform music of such composers as: John Adams (USA), Philip Glass (USA), Michael Nyman (UK), Sir John Tavener (UK), Iannis Xenakis (France), Avner Dorman (Israel - USA), Takashi Yoshimatsu (Japan), Marjan Mozetich (Canada), Georgs Pelecis (Latvia) and Arturs Maskats (Latvia). Except for that, the orchestra introduced premiers of some scores by such contemporary composers as: Joaquin Rodrígo (Spain), Yasushi Akutagawa (Japan), Vladimir Martynov (Russia), Pavel Karmanov (Russia), Leonid Desyatnikov (Russia), Krzysztof Penderecki (Poland), Arvo Pärt (Estonia), Giya Kancheli (Georgia), Peteris Vasks (Latvia), Giovanni Sollima (Italy) and others.

Conductor and artistic director  Tatiana Kalinichenko is artistic director and chief conductor of the New Era Orchestra. She has become famous in Ukraine owing to her experiments with the academic music, which eventually formed the orchestra’s individual style. In 2003, Kalinichenko completed an opera- symphonic conducting course led by Professor V.Gnedash in Petro Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine. She also worked as a conductor in the studio «Young Opera» patronized by NMAU and in Dnipropetrovsk Academic Opera and Ballet Theater (2004–2006). From 2004 to 2010 Kalinichenko was a conductor of the National Presidential Orchestra of Ukraine.

FIA Card Services, N. A., 562 U.S. 61 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the means test in Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The means test had been adopted by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, and Ransom is one of several cases in which the Supreme Court addressed provisions of that act. The means test determines how much disposable income debtors have to pay back their creditors, and permits debtors to shield some income from creditors for expenses based on cost tables prepared by the Internal Revenue Service. The Court ruled in Ransom, primarily in reliance on supplemental commentary authored by the IRS, that a car-ownership cost allowance was available only to debtors who made loan or lease payments on a vehicle. This judgment resolved a circuit split regarding the allowance between the Ninth Circuit, which the Supreme Court affirmed in this case, and three other circuits that had all ruled the allowance applied even to debtors who owned their cars outright. The Court's opinion was delivered by Justice Elena Kagan, who was confirmed to the Court on August 7, 2010. The opinion was not only her first as a Supreme Court justice but also as a judge, and her participation in the case's oral argument, which was held on the first day of the Court's 2010 term, had also been her first. Justice Antonin Scalia, the sole dissenter, criticized the Court for using the supplemental commentary on the tables when the Bankruptcy Code only incorporated the tables but not the commentary. Background of the case The Chapter 13 means test President George W. Bush signs into law the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act on April 20, 2005. Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) to address perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.. One of the biggest changes, called the \\"heart\\" of the Act's \\"bankruptcy reforms,\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 64, quoting H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1, p. 2 (2005). was the adoption of the means test for use in Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings. Chapter 13 requires debtors to submit a repayment plan for court approval to obtain a discharge of their debts. The means test is a statutory formula that determines how much income the debtor can use for debt repayment, to ensure that debtors pay back as much as feasible. It permits debtors to shield a portion of their income from creditors based on \\"reasonably necessary\\" living expenses, which are calculated from claimed allowances for defined living expenses.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 65. This replaced the prior practice of bankruptcy courts having to make case-by-case determinations of a debtor's expenses to calculate available income. The statute provides, in relevant part: > The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly > expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, > and the debtor's actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as > Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service for the area > in which the debtor resides.\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 66 (quoting ). The National Standards and Local Standards referred to by the statute are tables that the Internal Revenue Service prepares for determining taxpayers' ability to pay overdue taxes. These tables list standardized expense amounts for basic necessities.See , directing the United States Secretary of the Treasury to \\"develop and publish schedules of national and local allowances designed to provide that taxpayers entering into a compromise have an adequate means to provide for basic living expenses.\\" As incorporated in Chapter 13, the tables, therefore, determine the categories of expenses for which debtors can receive income allowances and the dollar amounts of those allowances. The IRS also prepares the Collection Financial Standards, which are supplemental guidelines that describe how to use the National and Local Standards tables and what the amounts listed in them mean.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 66. Included in the National Standards at the time the case was brought were allowances for transportation costs, divided for car owners into tables labeled \\"Ownership Costs\\" and \\"Operating Costs.\\" The Collection Financial Standards explained that \\"Ownership Costs\\" represented \\"nationwide figures for monthly loan or lease payments,\\" \\"base[d] . . . on the five-year average of new and used car financing data compiled by the Federal Reserve Board.\\" The Collection Financial Standards further instructed that, in the tax-collection context, \\"[i]f a taxpayer has no car payment, . . . only the operating costs portion of the transportation standard is used to come up with the allowable transportation expense.\\" Lower court proceedings Jason M. Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2006 and itemized over $82,500 in unsecured credit card debt, including nearly $33,000 held by MBNA (later FIA). In his proposed five-year repayment plan, Ransom claimed the \\"Ownership Costs\\" allowance, fixed at the time at $471 per month for one car, for his 2004 Toyota Camry which he owned outright. Over the course of the plan, this allowance would amount to a total of about $28,000 withheld from creditors.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 67. MBNA objected on the basis that Ransom did not make loan or lease payments on the car and thus was not entitled to that cost allowance. The bankruptcy court agreed and denied confirmation of the plan.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 68. Ransom appealed to the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed, ruling that the expense amount only becomes \\"applicable\\" within the meaning of the statute when the debtor actually has such an expense.In re Ransom, The Ninth Circuit also affirmed, stating that \\"[a]n 'ownership cost' is not an 'expense'—either actual or applicable—if it does not exist, period.\\"In re Ransom, The Ninth Circuit's judgment created a circuit split with the Fifth, Eight, and Seventh Circuits, which had all permitted debtors to take the Ownership Costs allowance regardless of whether they made lease or loan payments.See Ransom, 562 U.S. at 68, noting the split of authorities between the Ninth Circuit and In re Washburn, 579 F.3d 934, 935 (8th Cir. 2009) (permitting the allowance), In re Tate, 571 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir. 2009) (same), and In re Ross-Tousey, 549 F.3d 1148, 1162 (7th Cir. 2008) (same). The Court also noted disagreement among bankruptcy courts, citing to In re Canales, 377 B.R. 658, 662 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2007), which had noted dozens of cases reaching opposing results. Ransom petitioned to the Supreme Court for certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted on April 19, 2010 to resolve the circuit split.Ransom v. MBNA, America Bank, N.A., . The Supreme Court's decision Briefing and oral argument Amicus curiae briefs were submitted by the federal government and by Yale Law School professor G. Eric Brunstad, Jr., in support of the respondent, MBNA/FIA, urging affirmance; and by the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys in support of the petitioner, Ransom, urging reversal. Oral argument was held on Monday, October 4, 2010, the first day of the Court's 2010 term. In addition to the attorneys for the parties, the Acting Solicitor General was granted leave to participate as amicus curiae. Court observers focused on the newly appointed Justice Elena Kagan, in what was her first public task as a judge: she asked several questions that New York Times Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak described as \\"crisp and pointed\\" and as displaying \\"mastery\\" of the difficult legal questions.. Liptak counted Kagan as having asked eight questions; another reporter, however, counted ten: . Justice Antonin Scalia, known for his strict textualist jurisprudence, criticized the petitioner for not including in his appellate brief the statutory language that was at issue. Chief Justice John G. Roberts suggested that there was no good answer to the issue in the case, characterizing the parties' arguments as leading to equally \\"absurd\\" results. Opinion of the Court Newly appointed Justice Elena Kagan delivered the Court's opinion, her first as a judge. The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision, in an opinion delivered by Justice Elena Kagan that was her first on the Court. All other justices joined the opinion except Justice Antonin Scalia, who filed a dissent. The Court viewed the key word in the statute to be \\"applicable\\", in that the debtor may only claim \\"applicable\\" expense allowances listed in the Standards, not all expenses. As the statute did not define \\"applicable\\", the Court looked to its ordinary meaning, and determined that an expense allowance is \\"applicable\\" \\"only if the debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered by the table—that is, only if the debtor will incur that kind of expense during the life of the plan.\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 70. This, in effect, requires courts to make a \\"threshold determination of eligibility\\" for the debtor regarding their claimed allowances. In support of its interpretation, the Court explained that it ensured that the term \\"applicable\\" carried meaning, as every word in a statute should, to avoid the word being superfluous.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 74. It also comported with the statute's definition at of \\"disposable income\\" as \\"current monthly income...less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended\\", because if a debtor won't actually have a particular kind of expense then an allowance to cover that cost is not \\"reasonably necessary.\\" Finally, the Court viewed its interpretation as in furtherance of the objectives of BAPCPA, which was to ensure that debtors pay creditors the maximum amount they can afford.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 71. To resolve the question of what kind of expense the \\"Ownership Costs\\" allowance covered, the Court turned to the Collection Financial Standards (CFS). Though the statute did not incorporate the CFS, the Court thought that, given that the National and Local Standards are created, revised, and applied by the IRS, \\"[t]he agency might, therefore, have something insightful and persuasive (albeit not controlling) to say about them.\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 73 n. 7. The Court accordingly declared that courts may consult the CFS in aid of interpreting the National and Local Standards so long as it is not contrary to the statutory language. Regarding the \\"Ownership Costs\\" table, the CFS explained that the dollar amounts derived from a five- year average of car financing data compiled by the Federal Reserve Board. The CFS further stated that only individuals who made such payments were eligible for that deduction. All other costs associated with owning a car, such as maintenance, insurance, and registration, were included in the \\"Operating Costs\\" allowance, which Ransom had also claimed.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 72. Because Ransom owned his car outright, the Court, therefore, concluded that he was not eligible for the \\"Ownership Costs\\" allowance. Scalia's dissent Justice Antonin Scalia, in his dissenting opinion, criticized the Court for relying on commentary authored by the Internal Revenue Service that the relevant statute did not incorporate. Justice Antonin Scalia, in dissent, stated he would have held that a debtor who owns a car free and clear is still entitled to the car-ownership allowance. Scalia criticized the Court's reliance on the Collection Finance Standards, which, he pointed out, were not incorporated by the Bankruptcy Code and were not part of the Local Standards that the Code did incorporate.Ransom, 562 U.S. at 83 (Scalia, J. dissenting). \\"In the present context,\\" he wrote, \\"the real-world difference between finding the guidelines incorporated and finding it appropriate to consult them escapes me, since I can imagine no basis for consulting them unless Congress meant them to be consulted, which would mean they are incorporated.\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 83, n. * (Scalia, J. dissenting). Scalia further observed that the CFS were compiled for a different purpose. \\"[T]he fact that portions of the Local Standards are to be disregarded for revenue-collection purposes says nothing about whether they are to be disregarded for purposes of Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 81 (Scalia, J. dissenting). Regarding the Court's argument that its interpretation of the word \\"applicable\\" was necessary to give the whole statute meaning, Scalia countered that \\"the canon against superfluity is not a canon against verbosity.\\" In his view, the most reasonable meaning of the statutory language \\"according to the applicable provisions of the attached table\\" was simply \\"according to the attached table,\\" and just because Congress used unnecessarily prolix language did not mean it was necessary for the Court to import extra meaning to the extra words. If Congress had intended the meaning the Court construed, Scalia thought it would have been \\"more natural [for the statute] to say 'monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, if applicable.'\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 82 (Scalia, J. dissenting). Though the Court seemed most concerned that a debtor without actual ownership costs would nevertheless be able to withhold income from repayment on that basis, Scalia believed that such an overallowance was inevitable with a standardized formula like the means test. \\"Our job, it seems to me, is not to eliminate or reduce those oddities, but to give the formula Congress adopted its fairest meaning.\\"Ransom, 562 U.S. at 84-85 (Scalia, J. dissenting) (internal marks omitted).

Informally the position of the head of regional state administration or more commonly oblast state administration (for oblasts) is referred to as governor. However, its function is very different from a traditional gubernatorial position. The heads of local state administrations are appointed and dismissed by the President of Ukraine on the submission of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine for the term of office of the head of the state. Origin and overview The position derived from the institute of presidential representatives that was introduced during the presidency of Leonid Kravchuk in 1992.History of creation of the Presidential representatives. Presidential Representative of Ukraine in Crimea website After the resignation of Leonid Kravchuk as the President of Ukraine, most of presidential representatives positions in regions were discontinued and their functions were performed by chairmen of executive committee in each regional council. In the Autonomous Republic of Crimea the position is still called the Representative of President of Ukraine in Crimea. Earlier before fall of the Soviet Union, regional leaders were the first secretaries of regional committees of the Communist Party of Ukraine which was a constituent part of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Beside the local state administration all local (regional, district, city) councils have their own executive committees.Kuzio, T. Contemporary Ukraine: Dynamics of Post-Soviet Transformation. M.E.Sharpe, Inc., 1998 There are two offices of a head of city-state administration one for Kyiv and another for Sevastopol. The head of Kyiv City State Administration (governor) usually is served by the Kyiv city mayor elected by the popular vote. The head of Sevastopol City State Administration (governor) is appointed by the president on petition of the prime minister. Sevastopol is the only city in Ukraine that does not have a mayoral position. Due to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation the post of the head of Sevastopol City State Administration is currently suspended, while the Presidential representative in Crimea continues to function in the continental Ukraine along with other Crimean office of executive power. Appointment and termination The chiefs of local state administrations are appointed by the President of Ukraine with the recommendation from the Prime Minister of Ukraine. The role and powers of the position are defined in the Chapter 2 (Articles 8 - 12) of the Law of Ukraine \\"On Local State Administration\\" (Law № 586-XIV, parliament, April 9, 1999). Candidates on the position of the chief of district state administration are recommended to the Prime Minister of Ukraine by the chiefs of the respected regional state administrations. The appointment is terminated in case of violation of the Constitution of Ukraine and laws of Ukraine, loss of citizenship or discovery of dual citizenship, recognition of incompetency by a court, emigration for a residence abroad, gaining a court conviction by a legal force, violation of compatibility requirements, declaring no confidence by the two-thirds of the relevant council composition, filing a request for dismissal from office at own will. The appointment may also be terminated by the President of Ukraine in case of accepting the resignation of the Chief of Regional State Administration, petition of Prime Minister of Ukraine on the grounds prescribed by the legislation about the State Service, declaring no confidence by the majority of the relevant council composition, other circumstances foreseen by this or other laws of Ukraine, on initiative of the President of Ukraine. According to Article 118 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the heads of the local administrations are appointed and dismissed by the President of Ukraine on the proposal of the Cabinet of Ministers. According to the Ukrainian Constitution they should also resign after a new President is elected. City Champion. How Klitschko kept Kyiv, Ukrayinska Pravda (30 January 2020) The authority of the chiefs of local state administrations is terminated also upon their death. In case of election of the new President of Ukraine the chiefs of local state administrations continue to exercise their powers until appointment of the new chiefs of local state administrations in established order. Role and powers The chief thus heads the executive branch in each region, district, or city. The chief forms the composition of the local State Administration as well as its structure depending upon the budget allocations and requirements to the Article XVIII of the Law of Ukraine \\"On the Principles of Regulatory Policy in Economic Activity\\" (Law № 1160-IV, parliament, September 11, 2003). To execute the Constitution of Ukraine, laws of Ukraine, acts of the President of Ukraine, Cabinet of Ukraine, other bodies of executive power as well as own and delegated powers the chief issues orders. The orders of the chief adopted within his/her competence are mandatory for execution on respective territory by all authorities, companies, institutions and organizations, officials and citizens.

The Victoria Falls Conference took place on 26 August 1975 aboard a South African Railways train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between the unrecognised state of Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe) and Zambia. It was the culmination of the \\"détente\\" policy introduced and championed by B. J. Vorster, the Prime Minister of South Africa, which was then under apartheid and was attempting to improve its relations with the Frontline States to Rhodesia's north, west and east by helping to produce a settlement in Rhodesia. The participants in the conference were a delegation led by the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith on behalf of his government, and a nationalist delegation attending under the banner of Abel Muzorewa's African National Council (UANC), which for this conference also incorporated delegates from the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe (FROLIZI). Vorster and the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda acted as mediators in the conference, which was held on the border in an attempt to provide a venue both sides would accept as neutral. The conference failed to produce a settlement, breaking up on the same day it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome. Smith believed the nationalists were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks—which they had previously agreed not to do—and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters. The nationalists contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not believe he was sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so adamant about not giving diplomatic immunity. Direct talks between the government and the Zimbabwe African People's Union followed in December 1975, but these also failed to produce any significant progress. The Victoria Falls Conference, the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire, though unsuccessful, did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War, as they gave the nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter-campaign of 1973–74. A further conference would follow in 1976, this time in Geneva. Background Rhodesia (highlighted in green) was an unrecognised state in Africa with a mostly white minority government. After the Wind of Change of the early 1960s, the British government under Harold Wilson and the predominantly white minority government of the self-governing colony of Rhodesia, led by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, were unable to agree terms for the latter's full independence. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. This was deemed illegal by Britain and the United Nations (UN), each of which imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. The two most prominent black nationalist parties in Rhodesia were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)—a predominantly Shona movement, influenced by Chinese Maoism—and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which was Marxist–Leninist, and mostly Ndebele. ZANU and its military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), received considerable backing in training, materiel and finances from the People's Republic of China and its allies, while the Warsaw Pact and associated nations, prominently Cuba, gave similar support to ZAPU and its Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).; ZAPU and ZIPRA were headed by Joshua Nkomo throughout their existence, while the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole founded and initially led ZANU. The two rival nationalist movements began what they called their \\"Second Chimurenga\\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces, and, while based outside the country, sent groups of guerrillas into Rhodesia at regular intervals. Most of these early incursions, which had little success, were perpetrated by ZIPRA. Wilson and Smith held abortive talks aboard HMS Tiger in 1966 and HMS Fearless two years later. A constitution was agreed upon by the Rhodesian and British governments in November 1971, but when the British gauged Rhodesian public opinion in early 1972 they abandoned the deal on the grounds that they perceived most blacks to be against it. The Rhodesian Bush War suddenly re-erupted after two years of relative inactivity on 21 December 1972 when ZANLA attacked Altena Farm near Centenary in the country's north-east. The security forces mounted a strong counter-campaign and by the end of 1974 had reduced the number of guerrillas active within the country to under 300. In the period October–November 1974, the Rhodesians killed more nationalist fighters than in the previous two years combined. Mozambican independence and the South African \\"détente\\" initiative The effect of the security forces' decisive counter-campaign was undone by two drastic changes to the geopolitical situation in 1974 and 1975, each relating to one of the Rhodesian government's two main backers, Portugal and South Africa. In Lisbon, a military coup on 25 April 1974 replaced the right-wing Estado Novo administration with a leftist government opposed to the unpopular Colonial War in Angola, Mozambique and Portugal's other African territories. Following this coup, which became known as the Carnation Revolution, Portuguese leadership was hurriedly withdrawn from Lisbon's overseas territories, each of which was earmarked for an immediate handover to communist guerrillas. Brief, frenzied negotiations with FRELIMO in Mozambique preceded the country's independence on 25 June 1975; FRELIMO took power without contesting an election, while Samora Machel assumed the presidency. Now that Mozambique was under a friendly government, ZANLA could freely base themselves there with the full support of Machel and FRELIMO, with whom an alliance had already existed since the late 1960s. The Rhodesian Security Forces, on the other hand, now had a further of border to defend and had to rely on South Africa alone for imports. The second event was more surprising for the Rhodesians. In late 1974, the government of Rhodesia's main ally and backer, South Africa, adopted a doctrine of \\"détente\\" with the Frontline States. In an attempt to resolve the situation in Rhodesia, the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster negotiated a deal: the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda would prevent guerrilla infiltrations into Rhodesia from his country, and in return the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith would agree to a ceasefire and \\"release all political detainees\\"—the leaders of ZANU and ZAPU—who would then attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under a single banner and led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa and his African National Council (UANC). Vorster hoped that if this were successful the Frontline States would enter full diplomatic relations with South Africa and allow it to retain apartheid. Under pressure from Pretoria to accept the terms, the Rhodesians agreed on 11 December 1974 and followed the terms of the ceasefire; Rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered. Vorster withdrew some 2,000 members of the South African Police (SAP) from forward bases in Rhodesia, and by August 1975 had pulled the SAP out of Rhodesia completely. The nationalists, on the other hand, ignored the agreed terms and used the sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re-establish themselves both inside and outside the country. Guerrilla operations continued: an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months. Far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation, the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave the message to the rural population that the security forces had been defeated, and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO's victory in Mozambique. ZANU and ZANLA were unable to totally capitalise on the situation, however, because of internal conflict which had started earlier in 1974. Some ordinary ZANU cadres perceived the ZANU High Command members in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, to be following a luxurious lifestyle, contrary to the party's Maoist principles. This culminated in the Nhari rebellion of November 1974, in which mutinous guerrillas were forcibly put down by the ZANU defence chief, Josiah Tongogara. The ZANU and ZAPU leaders imprisoned in Rhodesia were released in December 1974 as part of the \\"détente\\" deal. Robert Mugabe had been elected ZANU president while they were incarcerated, though this was disputed by its founding leader, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, who continued to be recognised as such by the Frontline States. On his release, Mugabe moved into Mozambique to consolidate his supremacy within ZANU and ZANLA, while Sithole prepared to take part in talks with the Rhodesian government as part of the UANC delegation. Sithole retained the ZANU leadership in the eyes of the Frontline States until late 1975. The Victoria Falls Conference alt=A photograph of Abel Muzorewa According to the terms agreed in December 1974, the talks between the Rhodesian government and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen to adhere to the accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government, placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, on the opposite side of the carriage, would be able to attend without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975. The UANC delegation was led, as expected, by Muzorewa and included Sithole representing ZANU, Nkomo for ZAPU and James Chikerema, the former ZAPU vice-president, for a third militant party, the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe. According to Rhodesian intelligence, the various nationalist factions had not patched up their differences, were not prepared to accept Muzorewa as their leader and, to this end, were hoping that the conference failed to produce an agreement. The Rhodesians relayed these concerns to Pretoria, which told them firmly that the UANC would surely not risk losing the support of Kaunda and the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere by deliberately sabotaging the peace process. When the Rhodesians persisted in their complaints, citing evidence of nationalist infighting in Lusaka, the South Africans were terser still, eventually wiring Salisbury: \\"If you don't like what we are offering, you always have the alternative of going it alone!\\" alt=A photograph of Ian Smith The conference started on the morning of 26 August as planned. The six Rhodesian delegates took their places first, then around 40 nationalists entered and crowded around Muzorewa on the opposite side of the cramped railway carriage. Vorster and Kaunda arrived and sat on the Rhodesian side, where there was more space, and each spoke in turn, giving their blessing to the negotiations. Muzorewa then opened the proceedings at Smith's invitation. Speaking assertively, the bishop gave three concessions which would have to be given by the Rhodesian side for talks to begin: first, one man, one vote was established by Muzorewa to be \\"a basic necessity\\"; second, an amnesty would have to be given for all guerrilla fighters, including those convicted of murder by the High Court in Salisbury; and finally, all of the nationalists would have to be given permission to return to Rhodesia as soon as possible to begin political campaigning. Smith replied calmly that Kaunda, Nyerere and Vorster had all assured him that the UANC had agreed not to demand preconditions for talks, and that Kaunda and Vorster had in fact confirmed this to him that same morning; his delegation was therefore surprised by Muzorewa's confrontational opening speech. Smith says that his reply \\"provoked a flood of rhetoric\\"; the nationalists evaded his words and, one by one, gave passionate speeches about being \\"a suppressed people ... denied freedom in their own country\\" who only wanted to \\"return home and live normal, peaceful lives\\". Smith sat back and waited for them to finish, then responded that there was nothing stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished, and that they were in this situation by their own hand. They themselves, he said, had refused the Anglo-Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously, which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks \\"preferential franchise facilities\\", and they themselves had chosen to use \\"unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the legal government of our country.\\" The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before, repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf. This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up, Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC's \\"terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for ... murders and other atrocities\\". Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a \\"very small thing\\" as immunity to the nationalist leaders. The conference broke up without any agreement or progress having been made. Aftermath: direct talks between the government and ZAPU in Salisbury alt=A black-and-white photograph of Joshua Nkomo After the failure of the talks across the Falls, even the facade of a united front amongst the nationalists was broken on 11 September, when Muzorewa expelled Nkomo and four of his deputies from the council after they suggested a new leadership election be held. ZAPU contacted Salisbury soon after, stating that they wished to enter talks directly with the government. Smith \\"opted for the unthinkable\\", in the words of Eliakim Sibanda, reasoning that for all of their differences, Nkomo was still, as Sibanda writes, \\"a seasoned and pragmatic politician\\", who commanded a not insignificant force of guerrillas. The ZAPU leader was popular, too, not only locally but also regionally and internationally. If he could be brought into an internal government, and ZIPRA onto the side of the security forces, Smith thought, ZANU would find it difficult to justify continuing the guerrilla war, and even if they did so, they would be less likely to win. Dr Elliot Gabellah, Muzorewa's deputy in the UANC, told Smith that Nkomo was \\"the most balanced and experienced\\" of the nationalist leaders, and that most Ndebele now favoured open negotiation. He said that most Ndebele would support a deal between the government and Nkomo, and that Muzorewa probably would as well. Meetings between Nkomo and Smith were duly arranged, and the first took place in secret in October 1975. After a few clandestine sessions passed without major problems, the two leaders agreed to have formal talks in the capital in December 1975. Nkomo was wary of being labelled a \\"sell-out\\" by his ZANU rivals, particularly Mugabe, so to prevent this from happening he first consulted Kaunda, Machel and Nyerere, the presidents of the Frontline States. Each of the presidents gave his approval to ZAPU's participation in direct talks, and with their blessing Nkomo and Smith signed a declaration of intent to negotiate on 1 December 1975. Constitutional negotiations between the government and ZAPU began in Salisbury ten days later. The ZAPU delegation proposed an immediate switch to black majority rule, a government elected on a \\"strictly non-racial\\" basis, and reluctantly offered some sweeteners for the Rhodesian white population, \\"which we detested\\", Nkomo says, including some reserved seats for whites in parliament., quoted in The talks dragged on for months afterwards, with little progress being made, though Smith notes the \\"congenial atmosphere, with both sides ready to crack a joke\\". Nkomo's account of the meetings is less favourable, stressing Smith's perceived intransigence: \\"We went to great lengths to offer conditions that the Rhodesian régime might find acceptable, but Smith would not budge.\\" Notes References Sources   Category:1975 conferences Category:1975 in international relations Category:1975 in Rhodesia Category:20th-century diplomatic conferences Category:Diplomatic conferences in Zambia Category:Diplomatic conferences in Rhodesia Category:Foreign relations of Rhodesia Category:History of Rhodesia Category:Rhodesian Bush War Category:History of Zimbabwe Category:Rhodesia–Zambia relations ","title":"Victoria Falls Conference (1975)"},{"id":"33925680","text":"The list of shipwrecks in June 1939 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during June 1939. 1 June 2 June 5 June 8 June 10 June 12 June 14 June 15 June 16 June 17 June 18 June 19 June 21 June 22 June 23 June 24 June 26 June 27 June 28 June 30 June References 1939-06 06 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in June 1939"},{"id":"33925681","text":"The Pan-African University (or Pan African University) (PAU) is a post- graduate training and research network of university nodes in five regions, supported by the African Union. The new organization is also supported by the Association of African Universities. Formation The first African Ministerial Conference on Science and Technology was held in 2003 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The attendees undertook to improve the quality of science and technology education, and saw that the PAU would be necessary to improve the quality of science education and thereby to improve productivity of African economies. These ideas were elaborated in a \\"concept note\\" which outlined the objectives of the PAU. In 2008 the African Union agreed that the PAU should be established. A high-level panel was appointed in 2009 to oversee the PAU. The PAU was officially launched in 2011, and the University's Statute was adopted in 2013. The PAU high level panel included Njabulo Ndebele, author and former vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and Ahmadou Lamine Ndiaye, president of the Sénégal Academy of Science and Technology. An interim Rectorate took over the high level panel, headed by Deputy Rector Professor Kassa Belay of Ethiopia. A steering committee stakeholders including representatives of the African Union Commission, eminent African academics, Africans in the Diaspora, partners, the public and private sector performed the role of a Council until the establishment of the PAU Council in June 2015. ( Objectives The PAU aims to provide the opportunity for advanced graduate training and postgraduate research to high- performing African students. Objectives also include promoting mobility of students and teachers and harmonizing programs and degrees. According to Kenyan Education Minister Sam Ongeri the PAU will stimulate collaborative and internationally competitive research, and enhance the attractiveness of African higher education and research institutions. Regional Institutes UN subregions of Africa The Pan African University addresses five crucial thematic areas, through a network of five flagship institutes, namely Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation; Life and Earth Sciences (including Health and Agriculture), Governance, Humanities and Social Sciences; Water and Energy Sciences (including Climate Change); and Space Sciences. The thematic areas are assigned to institutes hosted by existing Universities of excellence across Africa’s five geographic regions as follows * The Institute for Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI), hosted by the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya (Eastern Africa); * The Institute for Life and Earth Sciences (including Health and Agriculture (PAULESI), hosted by the University of Ibadan in Nigeria (Western Africa); * The Institute for Governance, Humanities and Social Sciences (PAUGHSS), hosted by the University of Yaounde II in Cameroon (Central Africa); * The Institute for Water and Energy Sciences (including Climate Change (PAUWES), hosted by the University of Tlemcen in Algeria (Northern Africa); and * The Institute for Space Sciences (PAUSS) to be hosted by a University in the Republic of South Africa (Southern Africa). When fully deployed, each PAU thematic institute will be linked to ten Satellite Centers with complementary thematic specializations, inter- and trans-disciplinary programs. At full operational capacity, the PAU will incorporate 50 centers of excellence under its five academic hubs across Africa. Implementation status PAU Institutes are currently operational in four of Africa’s five regions (Western, Eastern, Central and Northern regions), whilst negotiations are ongoing to operationalize the fifth PAU Institute in Southern Africa. The first batch of 55 students graduated in Kenya in November 2014, and another batch graduated in November 2015, from the Life and Earth Sciences Institute in Nigeria. PAU has an existing student population of 314 with a new admissions list of 350 for the 2015/2016 academic year. The call for student applications for the 2015-2016 academic year attracted 5629 applicants, representing an overall increment of 361% from the previous year. The number of female applicants increased by 560.3 percent, and the proportion of female applicants increased across institutes. The January 2015 Summit of Heads of State and Government also appointed Tolly Mbwette (Tanzania) as the President and Paulo Horácio de Sequeira e Carvalho (Angola) as the Vice President of the PAU Council for a three-year term, based on regional nominations. The Commission proceeded to constitute the broader membership of the Council in line with provisions of the PAU Statute, and the PAU Council held its inaugural meeting on 25 June 2015 at the AUC Headquarters in Addis Ababa. The Council held its first meeting in June and an extraordinary meeting in October 2015. At both meetings, priority matters bordering on the project’s progress and development were discussed, including the need to amend the PAU Statute to confer greater autonomy upon the university. The January 2015 Summit also selected the Republic of Cameroon to host the Pan African University Rectorate, following evaluation missions to the countries that applied to host the Rectorate including Benin, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Tunisia. Consultative communication has been ongoing between the Commission and the Government of Cameroon resulting in the adoption of a roadmap for the final relocation of the Rectorate to Yaounde by the end of March 2016. PAU scholarship grants PAU offers full scholarships to all students enrolled into its programmes following a competitive admissions process. Calls for scholarship applications are issued and widely disseminated by the Rectorate and students apply online. PAU Institutes establish juries of local, regional and international experts to select students and Institute Boards submit the final list of selected students to the Rectorate. The PAU Senate makes final recommendations on student admission to the PAU Council. Before enrolment, each student signs a scholarship agreement specifying the conditions of the offer and the duties and responsibilities of both parties. In the scholarship agreement, PAU Students are required to make an undertaking to serve any African Union Member State for a period equal to at least the duration of the scholarship after the successful completion of their studies. Students are obliged not to engage in any income generating activities that will interfere with their academic programmes. Student engagement in income generating activities shall be approved by the PAU Rectorate, only if such activities will not interfere with the student’s academic programme. The scholarship grant covers the following costs: * Tuition fees, paid directly to the relevant PAU institute; * A stipend of $750 per month for Masters, and $1,100 for PhD students, to support the student’s living costs including food, housing, utilities, local transportation and medical insurance; * Students not permanently resident in the country hosting the institute they are attending are entitled to a single, economy return air ticket for the most direct route between their country/city of permanent residence and the host country/city; and * Students permanently resident in the country hosting the institute they are attending are entitled to $100 to cover the cost of their travel. The PAU Rectorate reserves the right to terminate or suspend the grant if there is compelling evidence that the student has not complied with any of the provisions of the scholarship agreement. PAU Partnerships PAU Thematic Partners are responsible for strengthening the teaching and research capacity of the Institutes and Centers through the acquisition of world-class equipment and facilities as well as the incorporation of best practices and standards. Thematic Partners are also expected to make financial and technical contributions towards the running of PAU Institutes. Among PAU Partners, those supporting more than one thematic area are designated Key Thematic Partners (KTPs). Pan African University Alumni Association The General Assembly of the PAUAA held at The African Union Commission Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 12-13 December 2017 ended with the official inauguration of the Pan African University Alumni Association and assumption of office by the Inaugural members of the Bureau.

Considered one of the earliest anti-drug songs, she wrote the piece after becoming addicted to codeine, which Sainte- Marie had been given for a bronchial infection. She recorded it for her debut album, It's My Way! (1964). \\"Cod'ine\\" is a solo performance by Sainte-Marie, with her vocal accompanied by a twelve-string acoustic guitar. The lyrics are a personalized portrayal of addiction; the spelling reflects her pronunciation of the word, which rhymes with \\"rise\\" and \\"time\\" in the song's verses. As one of her best-known songs, it is included on several compilations. Her performance at the Newport Folk Festival was filmed and appears on Murray Lerner's documentary Festival (1967). A variety of artists have recorded \\"Cod'ine\\" (usually as \\"Codine\\"), making it one of Sainte-Marie's most often covered songs. Background and composition In the early 1960s, after Sainte-Marie contracted a bronchial infection, a doctor treated her with a regimen of codeine, an opiate painkiller and cough suppressant. She thought the injections and prescriptions were antibiotics and vitamins, but after a few weeks, she began to show signs of withdrawal between doses. Sainte-Marie contends that the original doctor did not advise her about the drug and believes that he intended to get her and other girls dependent so he could exploit them. She overcame her addiction, but it affected her deeply: her pain was compounded by a sense of betrayal and personal violation. As a way to deal with her experience and caution others, Sainte-Marie wrote \\"Cod'ine\\". In her biography, Andrea Warner elaborated: \\"'Cod'ine' was written in despair but also in anger... It was worldweary and from the bone, leaden with exhaustion and frustration and... trauma, oppression, and violation\\". AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes her lyrics as \\"accurately reflecting the horror of opiate addiction, the stark, barren imagery of the lyrics are positively frightening\\": Sainte-Marie in concert, 1968 Sainte-Marie's vocal delivery reflects \\"the wildness of her vulnerability and her broken howls are chilling... the aftershocks of her vibrato almost swallowing words whole as she bellows, 'An' it's real, one more time'\\", as described by Warner. Sainte- Marie is a self-taught guitarist and often used her own alternative tunings. This allowed her to explore different chord voicings and, by using a twelve- string acoustic guitar, to add a droning quality. She recorded the song at a studio in the Manhattan Towers hotel in New York City for producer Maynard Solomon and Vanguard Records. Release and reception In 1964, \\"Cod'ine\\" was released on Sainte-Marie's first album, It's My Way! Solomon contributed the liner notes, which included blurbs about each song. For \\"Cod'ine\\" he wrote: The album reportedly sold well, but did not reach the album charts. John Kay, singer, guitarist and songwriter for the popular 1960s rock group Steppenwolf, recalled purchasing the album after hearing her live for the first time. He was struck by the sheer emotional intensity of songs such as \\"Cod'ine\\" and Sainte-Marie's unrestrained vocal delivery. In a retrospective album review for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann called it \\"one of the most scathing topical folk albums ever made. Sainte-Marie sings in an emotional, vibrato- laden voice... Even decades later, the album's power is moving and disturbing\\". In a song review, Greenwald called it a \\"true coffeehouse classic [and] one of Buffy Sainte-Marie's most well-loved (and most covered) songs\\". Festival!, the 1967 documentary film about the Newport Folk Festival by director Murray Lerner, includes a performance of the song by Sainte-Marie. The original appears on several compilation albums, such as The Best of Buffy Sainte-Marie (1970) and Best of the Vanguard Years (2003). Legacy Music journalist Richie Unterberger identified \\"Cod'ine\\" as \\"one of the few '60s songs to explicitly address the dangers of drugs\\". Author Michael C. Keith includes \\"Cod'ine\\", along with \\"Signed D.C.\\" written by Arthur Lee (1966, Love), \\"Amphetamine Annie\\" by Canned Heat (1968), \\"The Pusher\\" by Hoyt Axton (1968, Steppenwolf), as examples of songs from the 1960s that explore a similar theme. Although Sainte-Marie had kicked the habit, she feels that the song led some to perceive her as an addict: \\"In my first couple of records, whoever was choosing the takes wanted me to sound like I was kind of old and dying. I think they imagined that maybe I was a junkie or they probably thought that I was going to be a young casualty.\\" In 1964, Scottish folk singer Donovan recorded a demo version of \\"Cod'ine\\". Greenwald described it as \\"a true progressive folk music classic... a dark, minor-key folk-blues with a fabulously simple descending guitar riff\\". In 1992, Donovan's demo was released on the box set, Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964–1976, under the title \\"Codine\\". Early demos also recorded by Janis Joplin (1965, with modified lyrics) and Gram Parsons (1965–1966) were eventually issued on compilation albums. In the 1960s, the song became popular among musicians in the San Francisco area, usually using the title \\"Codine\\". The Charlatans recorded the song in 1966 using a folk rock arrangement for their first single. However, their record company refused to issue it because of the drug references. Later, group retrospective albums sometimes include it under the title \\"Codine Blues\\", such as The Amazing Charlatans (1996). Similarly, when Quicksilver Messenger Service recorded the song for their first single, Capitol Records was reluctant to release it. Instead, it was used for the soundtrack of Revolution (1968), a quasi-documentary film about the San Francisco scene. Greenwald commented: \\"[The song] took on a stronger meaning as the '60s came to a close and harder drugs were rampant. Quicksilver take and define the song by putting it into a blues/rock mode, propelled by a relentless, heavy rhythm [and they] truly make the song their own.\\" Later, the original studio recording and a live rendition from 1968 were included on the 1999 compilation Unreleased Quicksilver Messenger Service – Lost Gold and Silver. In the album liner notes, Unterberger commented: \\"[The group] adopt a nastier, punkier edge than many would have believed possible given their reputation as a hippie outfit.\\" Alternative rock group Hole recorded a vocal with acoustic guitar version, which is included as bonus track on their Japanese album release of Nobody's Daughter (2010). Warner described it as \\"an amalgamation of Sainte-Marie's original and Joplin's revision, and appropriately, [Hole singer Courtney] Love's vocals suggest a similar duality—pained and defiant—but also the snarled, disaffected, painted-on cynicism that Love so often utilizes to detract from her vulnerability\\".

Her son, the 2nd baron, had died aged only 27 in 1395, four years after the death of her husband the 1st Baron, thus her grandson was particularly important to her. She was licensed in 1417 to found a college of chaplains in the church.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1416—22, p. 69 Papal approval was given in 1418 when the church was named St. Michael the Archangel.Calendar of Papal Registers, vol.

His second wife survived him and married secondly between May 1462 and 1464 Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh of Gainsburgh K.G. (d. 1496). She was buried next to her second husband at Gainsborough. Progeny Tombstone of Reginald de Botreaux(d. 1420), Aller Church, Somerset. The recumbent effigy is of Sir John de Clevedon (d. 1372), whose daughter and heiress of Aller was Margaret Clevedon, the maternal grandmother of William de Botreaux, 3rd Baron Botreaux, father of Reginald escutcheon incised on tombstone of Reginald de Botreaux (d. 1420) in Aller Church, Somerset, showing the impaled arms of his parents: Baron: Argent, a griffin segreant gules armed azure (Botreaux); Femme: Azure seme of fleurs-de-lis a lion rampant or (Beaumont) By his first wife Elizabeth Beaumont he had the following children: *William, who died an infant before 1434 Date of death pre 1434 per Rogers, 1890, p. 147 and was buried at North Cadbury and after transferred to the Minorite Church at Bridgwater. *Reginald, died young 1420, the date incised on his tomb stone in Aller Church, Somerset.Reginald's tombstone states merely that he was filius Will dom. de Botreaux (\\"son of William Lord de Botreaux\\"). Rogers, 1890, p. 147, states his father to have been the 3rd baron Aller was one of the family's many manors. The tombstone is now affixed upright to the north wall of the chancel but was formerly set into the floor. It is well preserved for its age and displays within an heraldic escutcheon the griffin rampant of Botreaux impaled with the lion rampant on a field semee-de-lys of Beaumont, the marshalled arms of Reginald's parents. On a ledger line around the border of the slab is inscribed the following text in gothic script: > hic jacet RoginaldusRoginaldus (sic) filius William dom de Botreaux qui > obiit xxx die julii anno dom mccccxx (\\"here lies Reginald son of William > Lord of Botreaux who died the 30th day of July 1420\\") *Anne, married in 1426 Sir John Stafford. She did not survive her father and died without issue. *Margaret, his sole heiress, suo jure 4th Baroness Botreaux (d. 1478), married Robert Hungerford, 2nd Baron Hungerford (d. 1459). She was buried in Salisbury Cathedral in a now demolished tomb within a chantry chapel she founded there. The tomb and effigy of her husband in Salisbury Cathedral still exists. Death He died without surviving male issue on 16 May 1462, according to GEC's Complete Peerage, or was slain at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461 according to Rogers, 1877, p. 389\\\\. He was buried in North Cadbury parish church, in the chantry founded there \\"by his ancestors\\" Rogers, 1877, p. 389 as he had provided for in his will written 38 years before in 1424.Rogers, 1877, p. 388 He died seized of 50 manors, mostly in the West-country.Rogers, 1890, p. 148 His Inquest post mortem as a tenant-in-chief of the king dated 1462 refers to him as \\"William Botreaux, miles\\", i.e. \\"knight\\".GEC The Complete Peerage, p. 242 Tomb at North Cadbury The chest tomb with stone sculpted effigies of the 3rd Baron Botreaux and his 1st wife Elizabeth Beaumont was reported by Rogers (1890) to have been at one time situated in the usual place for a \\"Founder's Tomb\\", with the long side against the north side of the chancel wall with the feet end against the eastern wall,Rogers, 1890, p.147 but it was subsequently moved to the west end of the church, against the south wall of the tower, where it remains today. Rogers suggests it may originally have stood in the vicinity of the Botreaux chantry, in a side aisle, possibly where the organ is now situated, at the eastern end of the north aisle, a place of honour often used for founder's chapels. The attribution of the effigies to the 3rd baron and his 1st wife is not certain as no inscription remains. However the style of the plate armour and the lady's head-dress suggest a mid-15th-century date and the crest on the helm on which the knight rests his head is certainly that of Botreaux seen on the seal of the 1435 Exmoor charter, and shows an animal's body akin to a deer standing on a cap of maintenance with the front part of the animal in the form of a griffin, with the features of the face now lost, but with parts of the wings visible. He wears full plate armour and the SS livery collar around his neck and a pointed helmet with a wreath or orle around it. The features of the face are very worn away. His feet rest on a lion. The effigy of his wife, presumed to be Elizabeth Beaumont wears a horned (or mitred) head-dress adorned with pearls, with necklace and cross, long gown with mantle over, fastened with cord and tassells. Her head lies on a double cushion, the uppermost of a lozenge shape. Only the hands and feet of supporting angels remain attached to her shoulders. At her feet are two dogs, addorsed, one with bells. The chest tomb shows on the long side (facing north) panels of angels holding escutcheons, the former heraldic painting on which is now totally effaced. At the east end (the feet end) is a group of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Christ, with a knight kneeling in prayer towards her at her right-hand, and a lady (with horned head-dress) similarly kneeling at her left. The two kneeling figures represent the baron and his wife. The figures occupy 3 individual panels under gothic cusps. The text formerly painted on sculpted stone speech-scrolls attached to the kneeling figures is now totally effaced but would have been prayers to the Virgin Mary. On the west end of the chest tomb are painted three escutcheons on which painted quartered armorials are still visible albeit much worn away, but these may be later restorations. Certainly rampant griffins are visible, but not in the 1st and 4th quarters as might be expected for the arms of the husband, but in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. The arms shown in the 1st & 4th quarters appear to show 3 leaves with stalks and 3 escallops. There is a canopy above the heads of the effigies. Rogers (1890) reports that the appointments of the knight's armour were gilded and that the gown of the lady was red, the bodice blue and the mantle black. All such colouring has now disappeared.

(2000). Increasing tootling: The effects of a peer-monitored group contingency program on students' reports of peers' prosocial behaviors. Psychology in the Schools, 37(3), 263-270. Tootling is like tattling but refers to the reporting of only positive, rather than inappropriate, social behaviors.Skinner, C.H., Neddenriep, C.E., Robinson, S.L., Ervin, R., & Jones, K. (2002). Altering educational environments through positive peer reporting: Prevention and remediation of social problems associated with behavior disorders. Psychology in the Schools, 39(2), 191-202. The idea behind this concept is if young children can learn to tattle on inappropriate behavior, then they are capable of monitoring and reporting prosocial behavior. The objective of tootling is to get students to engage in more prosocial behaviors and to be aware and appreciative of these behaviors in others. Tootling is also helpful for teachers to foster awareness of positive behaviors and increase praise while downplaying a focus on negative behaviors and punishment. The word \\"tootling\\" is a combination of \\"tattling\\" (monitoring and reporting classmates antisocial behaviorCashwell, T. H., Skinner, C. H., & Smith, E. S. (2001). Increasing second-grade students' reports of peers' prosocial behaviors via direct instruction, group reinforcement, and progress feedback: A replication and extension. Education & Treatment of Children, 24(2), 161-175.) and the expression \\"tooting your own horn\\". Tootling differs from \\"tattling\\" because students report incidental instances of prosocial behavior, rather than negative. Tootling meets key criteria for classroom- based positive behavior support (PBS)Cihak, D.F., Kirk, E.R., & Boon, R.T. (2009) Effects of classwide positive peer \\"tootling\\" to reduce the disruptive classroom behaviors of elementary students with and without disabilities. Journal of Behavioral Education, 18, 267-278. and can be used in general and special education settings. In addition, tootling was considered a best practice strategy for special education instructors for providing an inclusive classroom.Boon, R. & Spencer, V. Best Practices for the Inclusive Classroom. Waco, Tx: Prufrock Press. Tootling Process # The tootling process begins with a group training session to teach students how to appropriately report positive peer behaviors. Students are not allowed to report on their own behaviors. They are given clear examples of tootling and then asked to give their own examples. At this point, the teacher or trainer offers feedback and/or reinforcement. Students are then given index cards that will be taped to their desks and used to record tootles. A correct \\"tootle\\" states a) the name of the \\"helper\\" b) the name of the \\"helpee\\" c) a description of the observed prosocial behavior. A group feedback chart is created, to count the cumulative number of tootles, and a group reward or reinforcer (typically an activity) is chosen. # # At the beginning of each school day, the students are given an index card that is then taped to the desk. Students quietly record any observations of peers helping peers seen throughout the day. If a student fills an entire card, he/she can turn it in for a new card. At the end of the day, students hand in their cards. The teacher then counts the tootles, only counting helping behaviors, and fills in the feedback chart. If the same instance is recorded multiple times, they all count. The next day, the teacher announces the number of tootles recorded and may read some examples aloud and offer praise. Once the set number of tootles is reached, the class earns the group reward. # # After the goal is met, this process can be repeated. Some alterations may be to make the tootle criteria more difficult or stringent or to choose a new group reward. It is encouraged to get suggestions from students for group rewards and to choose them randomly to ensure reinforcement for as many students as possible.

The concept involves the displaying of a Heroes Welcome Sticker, this can be by either private individuals, or business operators and simply indicates a special welcome to service personnel. Heroes Welcome is not a charity or discount scheme, the minimum offer is; \\"A Warm Welcome\\", participating members may choose to offer a small discount or additional service upgrade if they wish, but this is not mandatory to membership of the scheme. History The first Heroes Welcome scheme was launched in 2008 by the North Yorkshire resort town of Scarborough, it began as a simple reaction to the growing number of negative news reports regarding the poor treatment of service personnel by some in the community. The first posters were handmade by the staff of the Golden Grid Fish Restaurant and displayed with the help of the owner John Senior MBE TD, a retired Army Officer who had himself seen active service in Afghanistan during 2001/2002. The idea quickly found support amongst the Scarborough seafront business community and eventually came to the attention of the Town Mayor who requested that \\"Heroes Welcome in Scarborough\\" be formally adopted as good civic practice. In May 2008 Scarborough became the first Heroes Welcome Town, ensuring that service personnel were offered a special warm welcome wherever the Heroes welcome logo was displayed. By June 2008 over 250 local businesses had joined up to the scheme, membership proved to be diverse ranging across political and socio economic boundaries, early members included the South Beach Donkey concession, New York Times best selling author the Reverend G.P Taylor and Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round, home to the acclaimed British playwright Sir Alan Ayckbourn . The Scarborough scheme also won the support of a number of senior military and political figures, being seen as a simple and appropriate method for a community to show its open support to those serving in the Armed Forces. In March 2009 the founder, John Senior was invited by the Ministry of Defence, (Armed Forces Day Team) to give a presentation to members of the National Association of Civic Officers in order that they might better appreciate the benefits of forming closer relationships with the Armed Forces community. At the conclusion of the presentation a number of Civic Officers approached Senior wishing to explore the possibilities of joining the Heroes Welcome Scheme, at that time there was no facility or provision for a wider regional membership within the existing scheme. In order to address this issue an advisory group was formed and under the guidance of Lieutenant Colonel Toby Gray the then Commanding Officer of the Coldstream Guards a set of guidelines were drawn up to ensure that the scheme was appropriate and focused towards the Junior Ranks. The overriding principle was to create an internet-based self-sustaining open resource that was fit for purpose and would require only the minimum amount of administrative input. Development In June 2009, supported by the National Association of Civic officers, Heroes Welcome UK launched a national website at www.heroeswelcome.co.uk, and opened its membership to include those organizations, towns, cities and districts who wished to join the United Kingdoms only community partnership dedicated to the support of those serving in the Armed Forces. The first \\"Civic\\" member to join Heroes Welcome UK was the Borough of West Norfolk followed by Sefton District Council. Subsequently, additional towns, cities and districts joined up, each one setting up its own distinct \\"Heroes Welcome in Anyborough\\" scheme. The first county to join Heroes Welcome was Hampshire. The Chairman of the County Council, Anna McNair Scott, launched Heroes Welcome in Hampshire, at a ceremony held in the Great Hall of Winchester Castle, on Armistice Day 2011. This was followed on 5 March 2012 when Cllr John Fort, Chairman of North Yorkshire County Council launched Heroes Welcome in North Yorkshire from County Hall, Northallerton. The joining of Hampshire and North Yorkshire means that 70% of all UK based service personnel live in a Heroes Welcome area.

The people of Wootton Bassett will always show their respects to mark the bravery of these fine young people.\\" A message to Heroes Welcome UK from the Mayor of Royal Wootton Bassett, Councillor Mary Champion. Falkland Islands In June 2012 Heroes Welcome was launched across the Falkland Islands in support of the hosting for Veterans during this year's 30th Anniversary commemorations of the South Atlantic conflict. The Falkland's are the first Crown Territory to join the partnership and the local scheme coordinator is the Hon Keith Biles Speaker to the Falkland Islands Assembly. Gibraltar On 29 January 2013 Heroes Welcome In Gibraltar was launched at a ceremony held in the City Hall attended by 120 civil and military invitees . The event was co-hosted by, The Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo, His Worship the Mayor Anthony Lima, British Forces Commander Gibraltar Commodore John Clink RN also in attendance was the scheme founder John Senior. Funding and support for military charities Through its national network Heroes Welcome UK actively encourages the support of recognised military charities, maintaining a close relationship with many, including Help for Heroes, The Royal British Legion, SSAFA and the Soldiers Charity (Army Benevolent Fund). Working with FAB, (Family Activity Breaks) Charity . Through its local network Heroes Welcome is able to directly assist the work of FAB charity. Family Activity Breaks is staffed by military volunteers from all ranks and services who organise a variety of residential activity holidays for military families who have suffered a bereavement. By mobilising local business operators Heroes Welcome is able to directly improve the offers of assistance and support available in and around thea visited. Heroes Welcome as an entity is unable to seek charitable status (local government bodies cannot adopt charities). Without a regular funding stream the financing of local operations relies on the goodwill of each individual community scheme. The small amount of funding required for the cost of central administration (approximately £3,000/4,000 per year) is raised through private donations and the sale of G. P. Taylor's Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box series of novels. Copies of the books are sold directly from the Golden Grid Restaurant Scarborough which is understood to be the inspiration for the fictional Golden Kipper Restaurant owned by retired army officer Captain Jack Charity. A film version of the first bookhttp://www.scarborougheveningnews.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/captain- charity-in-film-debut-1-4507390 The Midas Box is now in production the cast includes, Sam Neill, Aneurin Barnard, Lena Headey, Ioan Gruffudd and Michael Sheen as Charity.

Future The management committee chaired by the scheme founder John Senior, has committed to continue with the Heroes Welcome initiative until such time as it is felt no longer appropriate. Parliamentary Early Day Motion Parliamentary business in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Early Day Motion 1582 Print version HEROES WELCOME SCHEME Session: 2008-09 Date tabled: 03.06.2009 Primary sponsor: Robert Goodwill, Sponsors: Grogan, John Hoyle, Lindsay Lancaster, Mark Russell, Nicholas Soames, That this House applauds the initiative of over 500 businesses in Scarborough that have already joined the Heroes Welcome scheme; notes that participants offer visiting service personnel special acknowledgement and discounts at hotels, restaurants and other service or retail firms; and calls on other towns and cities around the country to follow Scarborough's lead and join Heroes Welcome UK in order to give support, quiet recognition and a little extra hospitality as a way of showing gratitude to armed forces personnel and their families. Filter EDMs by: Total number of signatures: 57 Soldier magazine Article February 2011 Report: Sharon Kean Picture: Graeme Main FROM the modest beginning of a hand- drawn poster in the window of a Scarborough restaurant, a scheme encouraging local communities to show their gratitude for the Armed Forces has quickly evolved to become a nationwide network. Hundreds of local councils and companies have now signed up for Heroes Welcome, a campaign urging organisations to display a sticker as a demonstration of their support for the Services, and the number of participating outfits is growing by the day. In addition to a warm reception, many of those who have enlisted offer troops, veterans and their families deals and discounts, pledging everything from cheap train tickets and cut- price taxi fares to special offers in hotels and spas. \\"You can say thanks to a fireman or police officer at the scene but for Servicemen and women who do their work over the hills and far away, it's harder,\\" explained John Senior, the retired TA major-turned-restaurateur who launched the scheme in his home town two years ago. \\"Although we offered discounts in the restaurant we had no way of showing our gratitude for the job they do.\\"http://www.heroeswelcome.co.uk/images/press/press21.pdf References Category:Military-related organizations Category:Scarborough, North Yorkshire Category:Organisations based in North Yorkshire Category:2008 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Heroes Welcome UK"},{"id":"33925743","text":"The list of shipwrecks in July 1939 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during July 1939. 2 July 4 July 5 July 6 July 8 July 9 July 10 July 11 July 12 July 14 July 15 July 18 July 19 July 21 July 22 July 24 July 25 July 27 July 31 July References 1939-07 07 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in July 1939"},{"id":"33925778","text":"Irishtown () is a village in County Mayo, Ireland, located on the southern county border with County Galway about halfway between Claremorris and Tuam on the R328 regional road.

It is sometimes referred to as 'The Cradle of the Land League' due to its connections with the founding of the Irish National Land League. Land League Local tenant farmers were threatened with eviction from their holdings on the estate of the local parish priest, Canon Geoffrey Burke, and in response a meeting took place on 20 April 1879 that brought about a reversal of the potential evictions as well as a 20 percent reduction in rent. The meeting was the genesis of what would later that year become the Land League. Amenities and sport There are several facilities situated in the village, including the national school (first founded in 1897), community centre, church, corner shop, one pub, playground and playing fields, the former being renovated in 2010. Gaelic football is the predominant sport in the area. In 1973, Irishtown and its neighbouring village, Ballindine, amalgamated to form Davitt's G.A.A. club. Davitt's have won a number of underage titles, including three consecutive Under-21 Mayo County titles in 1983, 1984 and 1985.

In 2014, Grocers Supply was acquired by C&S; Wholesale Grocers.C&S; Wholesale Grocers to Acquire The Grocers Supply Company History Joe Levit, an immigrant from Russia, began a grocery wholesale business when he leased a three story building in the \\"Produce Row\\" area of Houston. In 1928 the company moved its operations to the warehouse, larger than the previous facility, in Downtown Houston, near the Buffalo Bayou. In 1936, the facility flooded. The company moved to a three story building at the intersection of Commerce and Jackson. The company later moved to another building on north Jackson. In 1956, the company moved its operations to its current location. The facilities there had been expanded on several occasions. The company's new cooler and freezer opened in 1983, across the street from its main warehouse. At the time it had of space. This facility was later expanded. In 2003, the company generated sales of $1.5 billion. By 2004, Grocers Supply had purchased the Handy Andy grocery chain, which was previously owned by H.A. Assets. Grocers Supply formed the subsidiary Bexar County Markets so it could manage the Handy Andy locations. In 2004 there were ten Handy Andy locations. In 2004, Grocers Supply purchased Fiesta Mart, a supermarket chain. Prior to the purchase, Fiesta was the company's largest customer. According to David Kaplan and Nancy Sarnoff of the Houston Chronicle, a local grocery industry member who wished to remain anonymous said that the acquisition was beneficial for both firms. He said that the acquisition protected Grocers Supply since it ensured that it would not lose Fiesta; if Fiesta was sold to another company, there was the possibility that Fiesta could switch to another grocery supplier. Kaplan and Sarnoff said that the anonymous employee added that the acquisition allowed Fiesta to get access to more capital and growth potential. The Levit family kept Fiesta until 2015, when it was sold to Acon Investments, a company based in Washington, DC.

In a hollow state there are many degrees of separation between the source of taxpayer funds and the final distribution of taxpayer-funded products or services. Services paid for by the state are produced by a vast network of providers and the task of the government is not to manage provision, but to negotiate contracts with providers. There is no \\"command and control\\" relationship between government and contractors. Contracts are managed by countless agencies and even more providers, there is no means of central record keeping or data management.Brinton Milward, H. (2012). Hollow state. In H. K. Anheier, & M. Juergensmayer (Eds.). The encyclopedia of global studies (pp. 808–809). London: Sage.Smith, Graeme. “The Hollow State: Rural Governance in China.” The China Quarterly, no. 203 (2010): 601-618. JSTOR. A Hollow State has all the standard edifices of governance although most are under the influence of third-party organizations, either for-profit or non-profit entities.  History  The history of government contracting goes back thousands of years to when Mercenary bands were utilized by the ancient Greeks, Persians, and Romans. In the United States, the history of government contracting is rooted in the history of English civil service. Throughout the 1600s, educated Englishmen could make a career out of negotiating the procurement of goods for local government, especially for the English military. This system was how much of the English military procurement was carried out, and was brought to the colonies by English settlers. The English military in the colonies was expected to obtain their own supplies locally. To this end, most military outfits employed a commissary general to obtain food and related supplies, and a quartermaster general to obtain supplies for construction, transportation, and weaponry. These officers had the authority to contract with local farmers and merchants. A version of this system was implemented by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution. This trend continued through the American Civil War and has grown and evolved into the modern system of government procurement. The United States government increasingly implements policy through a complicated network of providers. The system relies on the collaboration of multiple levels of government, for-profit, and non-profit entities.Brinton Milward, H. (2014). The increasingly hollow state: challenges and dilemmas for public administration. Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration, 36(1), 70-79. doi:10.1080/23276665.2014.892275-ALONSO, J. M., ANDREWS, R., & HODGKINSON, I. R. (2016). INSTITUTIONAL, IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL INFLUENCES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING: EVIDENCE FROM ENGLAND. Public Administration, 94(1), 244-262.- The history of the term \\"Hollow State\\" is shorter than the history of the practice, as capitalism emerged as a dominant social force, so did the influence of private contractors on government leaders. Brinton Milward, Director of the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona, uses the term Hollow State as a metaphor to describe the process and consequences of excessive government contracting.Cohen, L. S. (2010). [A Government Out of Sight]. Social History,35(2), 221-223. Examples of modern Hollow State iterations include: * China, though often in rural areas as opposed to on a national scaleSmith, G. (2010). The Hollow State: Rural Governance in China. The China Quarterly, (203), 601-618. * South Africa has been trending toward a Hollow State for years with moves empowering business over people The hollow state. (2015). Economist, 417(8969), 59-61. * Zimbabwe is an example of current Hollow State.  Infrastructure  The primary purpose of the hollow state is to function as a multi-organizational structure through which policy is designed and executed. The metaphor \\"Hollow State\\" is meant to be understood as a system consisting of units of government separated from their outputs but still linked by negotiation or contract. When nonprofit organizations receive contracts or grants to deliver public goods or services, the delegating agency assumes a sufficient level of capacity to implement the project or deliver the service. However, if the nonprofit community-based organizations are too limited in capacity to carry out their grants or contracts, then a disconnect occurs in the hollow state.Fredricksen, Patricia, and Rosanne London. \\"Disconnect in the Hollow State: The Pivotal Role of Organizational Capacity in Community-Based Development Organizations.\\" Public Administration Review 60, no. 3 (2000): 230-39. . One of the primary reasons privatization occurs is because of the severe capacity that limitations force the government to contract for services it does not have the ability to provide.Milward, H. Brinton. \\"Nonprofit Contracting and the Hollow State.\\" Public Administration Review 54, no. 1 (1994): 73-77. Usually this would involve a private development network supported by a public administration like the Chamber of Commerce and several private businesses. There are 2 types of networks that exist in the hollow state: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal networks consist of 3 types, policy making, resource exchange, and project based, all of which are between governments and non-governmental organizations. Vertical networks are the collaborations that occur between federal, state, and local governments. The purpose of this collaboration is to devise strategy for business retention, expansion, or recruitment. The reason city economics developers reach out to surrounding organizations and become multiple networks is due to the fact economic policy is designed and implemented under ambiguity and uncertainty. As complexities increase, grassroots initiatives become more sought after. Most nonprofit organizations are started with passion and enthusiasm for resolving a particular issue. Many of these are the small grassroots or community-based nonprofits that meet important human service needs for a specific geographic area or population.Balance and Competition: Norris- Tirrell, Dorthy. 2014. \\"The Changing Role of Private, Nonprofit Organizations in the Development and Delivery of Human Services in the United States.” Journal of Health & Human Services Administration 37, no. 3: 304-326. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed October 21, 2016) Furthermore, the need for more nongovernmental actors to deliver local services hence more actors equates to more hollowing of the state. In fact publicly funded social services are an increasingly important component of social provision spending and accounft for approximately one-fifth to today's welfare state expenditures.Allocation of Funding: Marwell, Nicole P., and Aaron Gullickson. 2013. \\"Inequality in the Spatial Allocation of Social Services: Government Contracts to Nonprofit Organizations in New York City.\\" Social Service Review 87, no. 2: 319-353. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed October 24, 2016) Substituting from a stable, linear government for complex networks may raise questions of allocation deliberations being solely prompted by cost/ efficiency not taking into account taxpayers other values.  Contracting  The Hollow State refers to the extent to which governments are directly involved in providing services.[4] Contracting out is when government allows a non-government institution to operate under the governments name to provide a public service. Hollowing out of government by allocating services to private organizations has three imperatives: the need to attract investment to compensate for lost revenues and meet the political imperatives set by the country and provincial governments; the need to receive inspection teams from higher levels of government; and \\"soft centralization\\" of township bureaus, which are placed under country or provincial government control. Advocates of privatization often make the point that government can provide or arrange for citizens to receive a service without the government actually providing it,[5] by contracting out. A government intent on privatization would decide what it wanted done and then contract with the private sector to provide the good or the service.[5] The federal government has always relied on state and local governments to distribute and provide services with money funded by the federal level. However, community-based development organizations have problems with accountability, responsiveness, and sometimes lose their connections with municipalities. This can lead to experiencing disparities in fundraising, fiscal and human resource management practices, and even skills in building and maintaining partnerships and gaining political support. Contracting out or privatization also redirects the funds that would otherwise go to the state and local government to private organizations. It can be said that there is a negative relationship between the neighborhoods where the central offices of those organizations are located, and neighborhood disadvantage, largely because so many distributive organization headquarters are located in downtown, higher-income areas. Government funding of nonprofit agencies in the United States of America increased during the grant-in-aid explosion of the 1960s and 1970s and continued during the Reagan and Bush administrations under the banners of privatization, limited budgets, and getting government off the backs of those it regulates.[5] Not all states who adopt the Hollow State find it successful and more often than not those states fail and lose their political goods. Criticism There are several outspoken criticisms of government contracting practices. Critics claim the hollow state can be inefficient, dangerous, and may violate human rights. The hollow state can effectively destroy a society's interests in humanities as money leads to a monopoly and/or oligarchy. A hollow state can be unreliable. When a government sector contracts out, there can be many problems. The hollow state is exemplified by increased reliance on third-party producers, which may result in a lack of oversight expertise in government. Contracting private organizations for warfare can lead to unethical methods and the hollow state can effectively destroy a society's interests in humanities as money leads to a monopoly and/or oligarchy.Bryer, T. t.(2008). Warning: The Hollow State Can Be Deadly. Public Administration Review, 68(3), 587-590. doi:10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00896.x Bryer, T. A. (2008). Warning: The Hollow State Can Be Deadly. Public Administration Review, (3). 587Delfeld, H. (2014). Human rights and the hollow state. Taylor and Francis. doi:10.4324/9781315887029Curry, W. S. (2010). Government contracting: promises and perils. Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, c2010- The problems of managing non- governmental, contracted organizations are extensive and severe. The number of degrees of separation between the source of funds and the implementation of those funds creates diminishing quality of returns with each new layer. Managers at every level are forced to deal with an uncertain budget cycle, long waits for payment for services rendered, financial crises, billing problems, frequently changing and contradictory rules and much more. Another thing to consider is the existence of the \\"principle-agent\\" issue, wherein the \\"principle\\" (the person giving the contract) can never have as much information about the requirements of the job than the \\"agent\\" (the one being contracted). This information disparity causes the principle to have unrealistic expectations and allows the agent to mislead the principle as to aspects such as cost, time, and human resources. Administrations that already exist within a country moving toward a Hollow State begin to be parsed in seemingly innocent fashion. In the name of \\"efficiency\\" government interests are delegated to private contractor, who will then often subcontract to other groups. For example, contractors hired to patch roofs with blue tarp for FEMA after Katrina received payment of \\"between $149 and $175 per (10ftx10ft square).\\" This price was comparable to installing entirely new roofs at the time. However; through a long string of subcontractors, the firms performing the final installations of the tarps \\"earned as little as $2 per 10ftx10ft square. Taxpayers end up paying exorbitantly as business interests takes complete control over the process of procurement.

Its ability to twist around a triple bond increases ease of intercalation within double stranded DNA in order to form triplex DNA. Certain configurations have been shown to stabilize Watson-Crick antiparallel duplex DNA. TINA-DNA primers have been shown to increase the specificity of binding in PCR. The use of TINA insertions in G-quadruplexes has also been shown to enhance anti-HIV-1 activity. TINA stabilized PT demonstrates improved sensitivity and specificity of DNA based clinical diagnostic assays.  Triplex DNA  Triple helixes are formed when a single-stranded triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) binds to a purine-containing strand of dsDNA through specific major groove interactions. Generally, the third-strand affinity of a TFO is low, due to the requirement for the formation of pH-sensitive C+–G–C Hoogsteen base triplexes under physiological conditions in the parallel (pyrimidine) binding motif. Modification of TFOs has been attempted in order to improve their binding affinities to their targets and to lessen restrictions in the dsDNA sequence with the design of new triplex nucleobases. Recently, it has been found that bulge insertions of (R)-1-O-[4-(1-pyrenylethynyl)phenylmethyl]glycerol (TINA) into the middle of homopyrimidine oligodeoxynucleotides can give rise to thermal stability in Hoogsteen-type triplexes and duplexes, whereas Watson–Crick-type duplexes of the same nucleotide content were destabilized. To increase ∆Tm, base mismatches should be placed in the center of the TFO and when feasible, A, C or T to G base mismatches should be avoided. Base mismatches can be neutralized by intercalation of a TINA on each side of the base mismatch and masked by a TINA intercalating direct 3'or 5' of it.  Structure   Applications   Assay specificity  Diagnostic assays using DNA hybridization are limited by the dissociation of antiparallell duplex helices. This can be improved by using DNA stabilizing molecules such as intercalators like ortho-TINA, which will stabilize the duplex formation. Studies show that the greatest increase in stability occurred when intercalating primers were used at the 3’ and 5’ ends. Placement of a TINA molecule in the oligonucleotide is capable of improving the analytical sensitivity of the probe hybridization. Para-TINA molecules decreases Tm in all positions especially when at the center of the oligonucleotide, while in the ortho-TINA molecules, the improvement was seen anywhere with neutralization at the center. Combination of terminal para- or ortho- molecule with an internal TINA molecule showed the highest increase of Tm. TINA molecules should be placed terminally for maximum increase in Tm. An increase in Tm increases the specificity of assays, like PCR.  Anti-HIV-1 activity  Recent studies show that the use of TINA insertions in G-quadruplexes has also been shown to enhance anti-HIV-1 activity. In such studies, two G quadruplexes forming sequences which exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity on cell lines were modified using locked nucleic acid (LNA) or insertions of TINA. Incorporation of this provides as much as 8-fold improvement of anti-HIV-1 activity and the introduction of 5’ phosophate was shown to inhibit the dimerization of G-quadruplex. Many antiviral quadruplexes forming oligonucleotides formed more thermally stable G-quadruplexes and also high- order G quadruplex structures, which may be responsible for antiviral activity observed.  Therapeutic applications  TFOs hold promise in anti-gene therapy, due to their high sequence specificity. However, the potassium levels in vivo promote TFOs to form G-quartet structures singularly, preventing the TFOS from interacting in a triplex formation and decreasing the effectiveness TFO cell therapies. However, as shown by Paramasivam et al., bulge insertions of (R)-1-O-[4-(1-pyrenylethynyl)phenylmethyl]glycerol (TINA) into TFOs with high guanine concentrations greatly decreases the presence of self-association via potassium. TINA-TFOs, then, may be used in the future to target the genome in vivo and perform genome manipulation toward a therapeutic end. The use of purine TINA-TFOs holds specific promise as antigene molecules toward the KRAS proto-oncogene.

Biography Battista was the first legitimate child born to Alessandro Sforza, lord of Pesaro, and Costanza da Varano (14281447), the eldest daughter of Piergentile Varano (d. 1433), Lord of Camerino, and Elisabetta Malatesta. In 1447, Costanza died after giving birth to her second child, a son called Costanzo (d. 1483), when Battista was 18 months old. After the death of their mother Battista and Costanzo, together with their illegitimate half-sisters Ginevra (14401507) and Antonia (14451500), moved to the court of their paternal uncle Francesco Sforza and his wife Bianca Maria Visconti where they were brought up alongside their cousins. Battista and her cousin Ippolita Maria received a humanist education and the former was fluent in Greek and Latin, giving her first Latin public speech at the age of four. She was said to be very skilled in Latin rhetoric and even gave an oration before Pope Pius II. The poet Giovanni Santi described Battista as \\"a maiden with every grace and virtue rare endowed\\". Her uncle Francesco Sforza arranged for her marriage to Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, who was twenty-four years older than her. The wedding took place on 8 February 1460, when Battista was fourteen years old, and she acted as regent during her husband's absences from Urbino.Gardner, H., & Kleiner, F. S. (2017). Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A Concise Global History, Cengage, p. 245. Their marriage was a happy one and they were described by a contemporary, Baldi, as \\"two souls in one body\\". Federico called Battista \\"the delight of both my public and my private hours.\\" Moreover, he spoke with her about political issues and she accompanied him to almost all official events outside of Urbino. Carrying on the Sforza family's tradition of humanist education for women, she educated her daughters similarly to the education she had received from her aunt Bianca Maria. Similarly, Battista's granddaughter Vittoria Colonna, daughter of Agnese, was a famous poet. After giving birth to six daughters, Battista gave birth to their first son and heir Guidobaldo da Montefeltro on 24 January 1472. However, three months after the birth of their son, Battista, having never fully recovered from her last pregnancy and labour, fell ill and died in July 1472.

Joe Reynolds and Ryan Kunkel were the co-CEOs. History Mirroring the television show The Amazing Race, Joe Reynolds organized and launched Great Urban Race, LLC, and hosted the first race on September 15, 2007 in Chicago. In December 2008, Reynolds brought on four event coordinator interns (\\"Tadpoles\\") and moved the business into an office in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood to help keep up with the planning and organizing of Great Urban Race. In 2009, Ryan Kunkel joined Reynolds to expand Great Urban Race and develop new events. In the summer of 2009 the company was renamed Red Frog Events, LLC, and the first Warrior Dash was held in Joliet, Illinois. In 2010, Red Frog Events moved from the Lincoln Park office to the current location at 320 West Ohio Street. On November 13, 2010, the first Beach Palooza (later rebranded as Beach Dash to maintain consistency with the Warrior Dash race series) was held at Daytona Beach, Florida. In 2011, Red Frog Bar Crawls were launched. The first event, a Halloween costume bar crawl called Nightmare on Clark Street, occurred on October 15, 2011 in Chicago. Snow Day in Washington D.C. was the next in the series, on December 17. Two more bar crawls were introduced in 2012: Bright 'N' Tight in San Diego, California, and Derby Days in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2012 the Firefly Music Festival was launched in Dover, Delaware, and Farm to Fork, a \\"farm style dinner,\\" took place on September 22 at McDonald Farm in Naperville, Illinois.

Construction commenced at the end of 19th century and completed before the World War I. It stopped a regular traffic in 1994. Nowadays, a part of the railway is utilized as a tourist attraction. Trains run regularly on weekends from the beginning of May till October. In July and August also on weekdays. The main station with all the rolling stock is located in Majdan near Cisna. Majdan train station  History  A construction of a narrow- gauge railway in Bieszczady mountains started in 1890, when Galicia was under Austro-Hungarian rule. Its main purpose was to make easier forest exploitation, by linking a heart of Bieszczady with standard-gauge First Hungarian-Galician Railway (Erste Ungarisch-Galizische Eisenbahn) in Nowy Łupków.Jerczyński (2007). p.14-15 The first line, 25 km long, led from Nowy Łupków eastwards to Cisna, mostly along Solinka river valley, and was opened on 21 January 1898. The gauge initially was 760 mm. The railway was operated by kkStB, and there ran two pairs of mixed trains and a number of timber trains daily. In 1900-1909 there were built further private forest extensions from Cisna towards Kalnica, Beskid (part of Smerek) and Roztoki Górne. During World War I the railway was used by Austro-Hungarian army, and was largely destroyed. In 1918, after Poland had regained independence, the railway was taken over by Polish State Railways (PKP). During economical crisis in 1930s, its importance decreased and private extensions towards Kalnica, Smerek and Roztoki Górne were disassembled. During World War II and German occupation, the railway was taken over by German Ostbahn. It was modernized, and the gauge was changed to current 750 mm. During East Front fighting in 1944, and subsequent fighting with Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the railway was demolished, and tracks and sleepers were removed in many places or damaged by tanks. After the war, Bieszczady mountains got deserted due to the forced resettlement of Ukrainian population, and PKP railways lost interest in renewing operation. By 1953 the line was handed over to State Forests administration (Lasy Państwowe), and subsequently it was rebuilt to serve as a timber railway. By 1960s it was enlarged: towards north-west to Mików (linking it with former private railway to Rzepedź), and eastwards through Cisna to Wetlina and Moczarne. Main depot and station was in Majdan (a settlement of Cisna). From 1963 there started also limited passenger traffic (it was the only public railway in Poland beside Polish State Railways at that time). Passenger volume reached some 30,000 a year. From late 1970s, a steam traction was replaced with diesel locomotives PKP class Lyd2. Due to economical crisis, competition from a road transport, and then Poland's transition to market economy in 1980s and 1990s, the railway, still operated by State Forests, fell into financial difficulties, and ceased operation in 1994. Its infrastructure and part of rolling stock were preserved thanks to placing the railway in National Monument Registry in 1992.  Restoration as a heritage railway  Thanks to efforts of local authorities, community and railroad workers, the Bieszczady Forest Railway Foundation was created in 1996 and it took over the railway operation as a tourist attraction, on a shortened track.Jerczyński (2007). p.16 It acquired its current name Bieszczadzka Kolejka Leśna (lit. Bieszczady Light Forest Railway), which had been its popular designation before. From 4 July 1997 the trains started to run on 11-km route from Majdan eastwards to Przysłup. From next year, the trains also ran westwards to Balnica and further Wola Michowa (17 km). For some time the trains ran even to Smolnik, but eventually Balnica became last station, and the westward route was shortened to 9 km.TRASA I: MAJDAN – BALNICA (9 KM) , kolejka.bieszczady.pl Soon the renewed railway became the major tourist attraction in Bieszczady. It runs several times a day in summer season starting from May, and occasionally in other months, there is also a possibility of hiring a special train. From 2007 it regularly carried over 50,000 passengers a year, and from 2014: over 100,000 passengers. In 2018 it carried 153,000 passengers, the biggest number by then.

Jarban was a Syrian freelance cameraman who was found dead one day after being arrested for reporting on an anti-government protest and the clashes between protesters and security forces in Al-Qusayr, Homs Governorate, Syria. His videos have appeared on several Arab satellite news outlets. Death Ferzat Jarban, a Syrian, was arrested on Saturday, 19 November 2011, while videotaping protests against the President Bashar al-Assad's government in Al-Qusayr, according to eyewitnesses. Jarban's body was found the next morning on the street side and his corpse was \\"extremely mutilated,\\" which included his eyes being gouged out, and with two bullet wounds. According to reports at least four more people were killed by security forces in al-Qasir on Sunday November 20, 2011. Just a day after Jarban was arrested and the same day he was found killed. Context The arrests and disappearance of other journalists in Syria over the past months is being tracked by the CPJ and other press freedom organizations. It is unknown whether Jarban was the first journalist killed in Syria because others are missing. At the time Jarban was killed, the protests against the ruling government in Syria were in their eight-month and were becoming increasingly violent as the army is backing President Bashir and human rights groups estimate that 3,500 have died so far. At the same time, international responses to Syria, such as those by the Arab League and Turkey, have also escalated. Jarban's murder occurred the day after the Assad government dismissed a monitoring mission demanded by the Arab League by calling for changes in the plan, and Syrian forces had killed 17 people on Saturday. Reactions Mohamed Abdel Dayem, the CPJ program coordinator for Middle East and North Africa, said, \\"The brutal murder of Ferzat Jarban illustrates the lengths to which the Syrian government will go in its efforts to suppress independent reporting. We demand the release of all journalists who remain in custody and hold the government accountable for their well- being.\\" Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said: \\"This ruthless attack must not go unpunished. It is a violation of the basic human right of freedom of expression and of journalists’ inalienable right and duty to carry out their work in safety and without hindrance.

It was founded in 1833. It was based at Trieste in the Austrian Littoral, the main port of the Cisleithanian (Austrian) half of the Dual Monarchy. As a result of the First World War the company was transferred into Italian hands. Operations continued from the port of Trieste under the name Lloyd Triestino, which was changed to Italia Marittima on 1 March 2006. It is now part of Evergreen Group. History The Austrian Lloyd Trieste Palazzo in the early 1900s In 1833, 19 sea transport insurance companies, banking houses and numerous individual shareholders, among them the Austrian politician Karl Ludwig von Bruck, decided to form the Austrian Lloyd Trieste. Originally the company answered the purpose to exchange information on European maritime trade and oversea markets, modelled on Lloyd's Register in London. Relying on a network of business correspondents and newspapers circulating in the Port of Trieste, it issued shipping news and also undertook to provide postal services with sailing vessels supplied by the Austrian Navy. French-language poster advertising the Trieste-Alexandria run Within a short period of its formation, the administration applied to Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria for the privilege of steam navigation with the Levant. On 20 April 1836 the steam-navigation department was introduced, and during its second meeting on 2 August the same year the department decided to build six steamships. For this reason, 1836 is considered the year the company was founded. In 1844 the company grew again when it acquired First Danubian Steam Navigation Company's line via Constantinople to Smyrna along with all its equipment. A year later, Austrian Lloyd was declared the property of the postal service of the Austrian monarchy. At the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Austrian Lloyd was present with its steamships Pluto, Vulcan, and America. Soon after the opening of the Suez Canal, the company launched its Trieste–Bombay line and established a weekly service between Trieste and Port Said. With the opening of the Bombay line, the company acquired an international dimension which was further reinforced by the extension of the line to Colombo in autumn 1879 and early in 1880 to Singapore and Hong Kong. The line to Alexandria, which was modernized in 1894 by the introduction of four new express steamers, and the line to Bombay proved to be the most profitable passenger lines in the company's history. Most of the staff of Austrian Lloyd were Croats, 80% of the staff, out of which 33,5% from Bocche di Cattaro.(in Croatian) \\"Naše more\\" 53(1-2)/2006 Vesna Čučić: Bokelji između Boke i Trsta, str. 78-80 (accessed September 5, 2016) The company started conducting pleasure cruises in 1906 with SS Bohemia followed in 1907 by SS Thalia which was built by William Denny and Brothers in 1886 and converted for cruising. The speed of shipping with the Levant increased and the passages to Calcutta were increased from nine to twelve. As a result, the company transferred the headquarters of the administration from Trieste to Vienna where, on 25 May 1907, the first general assembly of Vienna took place. The last expansion in the company's lines took place in 1912 with the Trieste–Shanghai express line.

It is located in the Bank of Scotland Head Office building (latterly part of HBOS and now part of Lloyds Banking Group) on The Mound. It has more than 50,000 visitors per year. History The Bank of Scotland Head Office building is a large Baroque Revival building topped with a dome which sits at the top of The Mound. The original building was designed in the Palladian style by Richard Crichton and Robert Reid and erected 1801-6, later altered by David Bryce in 1863 and by Peddie and Kinnear in 1878. Because of its location on a steep slope, it has an extensive basement area, part of which now houses the Museum on the Mound. Prior to 2006, a small museum display existed in a single basement room, but entry was by appointment only. This museum was originally opened in 1986 by the author Ian Rankin. The Museum on the Mound opened in September 2006. In 2017, Lloyds Banking Group announced that the Museum on the Mound would close at the end of that year. Following a public outcry, the decision was reversed and the museum will now remain open. Exhibits The permanent collection includes artefacts tracing the history of the Bank of Scotland since its foundation in 1695, paintings and architectural models of the Head Office building on the Mound, and the history of banking and building societies in Britain. There are also exhibits related to the history of numismatics, including artefacts historically used for barter, ancient tokens, Scottish coinage and paper money. Because the Bank of Scotland has a history of issuing its own banknotes — a right it has retained to this day — the collection includes a number of historic Scottish banknotes. There is also a Bank of England £1 million note displayed as an example of the high-denomination notes used to back banknotes issued by Scottish banks.

Unlike traditional hydrodynamic seals, Hydrostatic seals have two different pressure zones that are used to establish a balanced pressure zone between two seal faces. The two pressure system makes the seal unique because typical mechanical seals have one pressure zone that created causes a buildup of pressure that will eventually cause the seal to malfunction. After pressure has come to an equilibrium at the seal face, an incompressible fluid is then released between the two seal faces. The fluid creates a film around the seal face that acts as a lubricant and as a medium for the substance flowing through the seal. Hydrostatic seals have been used in the aircraft industry; however they have seen very little commercial use because there is minimal research about the seals.  Pressure and Operation  Once pressure is applied and the seal comes together, a viscous liquid is released between the two seal faces and a thin film is formed to help create an airtight seal. If the amount of pressure inside of the seal is increased and there is an excess of pressure between the face plates, the two faces move apart and the seal begins to open. On the contrary, if the pressure is dropped and there is not enough pressure within the seal, the two seal faces come together and the hydrostatic seal begins to form. The flow rate of the system can also be controlled with great accuracy by limiting the amount of pressure within the seal. Pressure zones can be changed to create an equilibrium within the system that would allow less leakage in the overall system.  Seal Face  The seals dual pressure zone helps maintain a constant pressure zone within the system. The constant pressure stabilizes the seal and does not allow the two seal faces to come in contact. There are face control grooves on both of seal faces that stabilize each face in the axial direction. The slightest axial movement will cause the two seal faces to touch and erosion of the seal will begin to occur. The rear face plate consists of a small opening that houses the injection system, which feeds the incompressible fluids through the system. Once the fluid is inside the seal, it forms a thin film around the entire inner system. After creating the film, the fluids then flow out of the seal and on to the rear face plate, which cools the system and prevents any excess heat from building up. This fluid cycle is continuously repeated while the seal is in operation.  Applications  Hydrostatic seals were first developed in the early 1960s to control the sealing of compressor air in the aircraft industry. Recently hydrostatic seals have only been used in the compressor industry because hydrodynamic seals have much greater application. The hydrostatic seal also has great potential in the chemical industry since it can be used to transport and seal chemicals. However, the chemical industry has set very strict regulations and the seal cannot be used for certain chemicals because of the constant seal leakage.  Generations of hydrostatic seals   First generation  The first hydrostatic seal was developed to replace current hydrodynamic seals; previous hydrodynamic seals were costly to manufacture and were tedious to assemble. First generation hydrostatic seals used a two pressure system to establish equilibrium at the seal face. The seal face was developed to work under high pressure conditions, however the seal face began to warp and deteriorate during stress tests. Once ammonia ( the liquid used in the first hydrostatic seal ) was added, the two seal faces would make contact with each other and begin the erosion process. Cold water was then tested as the incompressible fluid, it has double the viscosity as ammonia, which showed favorable results. Since cold water had double the viscosity of ammonia, the water prevented the seals from making contact with each other, thus causing the system to run properly. = First Generation: Issues = \\\\- High pressure conditions \\\\- recycles fluid in a continuous cycle, may have stagnant fluids which cause blockage \\\\- Seal faces began to erode under certain circumstances  Second Generation  The second hydrostatic seal was an attempt to resolve first generation hydrostatic seal problems: erosion of seals, high pressure build up, and stagnant fluids. Second generation hydrostatic seals had a redesigned seal face; new face control grooves were added to help stabilize the seals while under extreme conditions. Prior to the face control grooves, the seal faces were not balanced and would begin to move under high pressure conditions. Due to the movement, the seal faces would become misaligned when the seals moved, and that caused the seal faces to deteriorate, resulting in an unusable seal. = Second generation: Upgrades = \\\\- attempt to fix warping caused by system error \\\\- added face control grooves to prevent any erosion of seal faces \\\\- resolved any areas where fluid remains stagnant and cause blockage  Arising Problems  Hydrostatic seals should last multiple years without any deterioration to its components due to its overall structure. There should not be any contact between the two seal faces or else the condition of the seal will begin to deteriorate. Current Hydrodynamic seals begin to deteriorate over time because the two faces are always in contact with each other. In addition, any misalignment of the seal faces will cause them to rub which will begin to morph the seal faces and eventually cause the entire seal to become structurally unstable. Izchak Etsion, a researcher at the Lewis Research Center, conducted an experiment to test what happens to a hydrostatic seal when its faces are misaligned. Etsion discovered that high pressures directed towards the outer face of the seal would cause static instability, while high pressure on the inner face of the seal would cause the seal to become more stable. In addition, axial misalignment would also cause the horizontal shaft to shift in the vertical direction; this misalignment would result in a faulty seal if the restoring force is not great enough to correct the shift in components.  Leakage  The structure of the seal brings up the problem of leakage within the system. Since there is always a minuscule gap between two parts, there is always the problem of leakage, however the system’s structure allows leakage to be controlled to a very precise level. Another problem that arises about hydrostatic seals is that excess leakage may eventually lead to erosion of the seal’s structure. Due to the axially rotating face seal, any excess leakage will have a high fluid velocity which can erode away at the face plates, eventually leading to a faulty seal.

Early life Born in North London to graphic designer Alan Aldridge, Miles grew up accustomed to celebrity – John Lennon was a family friend, as well as Eric Clapton and Elton John. When he was a child, he posed with his father for Lord Snowdon. At the age of 12, Alan Aldridge moved to Los Angeles where he formed a new family. Miles stayed in London with his mother Rita, a housewife, and his half brother Marc Aldridge and sister Saffron Aldridge. His two half- sisters Lily Aldridge and Ruby Aldridge are also models. He studied illustration at the Central St Martins to follow his father's steps and afterwards briefly directed pop videos (for bands including The Verve, The Charlatans and Catherine Wheel). He moved into photography by chance: he sent some photos of an aspiring model girlfriend to an agency and fell into fashion when British Vogue called him as well as her. By then he had hung out on shoots with his sister and traveled to New York in the mid-nineties, where he started working almost immediately. Career Initially Aldridge shot covers of the American monthly fashion magazine W, then he worked for Numéro, Teen Vogue, Vogue Nippon, The New York Times Magazine, GQ, The New Yorker, The Face, Paradis and Harper's Bazaar. For many years he has been an important contributor for Vogue Italia, building a solid friendship with Franca Sozzani. Aldridge worked as an advertising photographer for Longchamp, MAC Cosmetics, Sergio Rossi, Carolina Herrera, Lavazza and Mercedes E-Class, among the others. He shot for noted fashion designers such as Karl Lagerfeld, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent e Paul Smith. Exhibitions Many private and public art galleries have hosted Aldridge's photographs around the world: in 2007 the Miami Beach Art Photo Expo; in 2006 and in 2008 the Galerie Alex Daniels in Amsterdam with solo shows The Cabinet and Acid Candy; in 2010 the Contributed Studio for the Arts in Berlin and the Gallery Hotel Art in Florence. In 2009 Steven Kasher Gallery displayed Pictures for Photographs, his first solo show in the United States. The exhibition and a monographic volume were the peak of a project combining drawings and photographs, born from a collaboration with Karl Lagerfeld and Gerhard Steidl. In New York his work was showcased also at the International Center of Photography with am exhibition entitled Weird Beauty.

His work is highly controlled with a cinematic effect.  Writing on Miles Aldridge's work  * Miles sees a color coordinated, graphically pure, hard-edged reality. — David Lynch * Miles Aldridge constructs dreams. That is his artistic and commercial practice. He understands the essential ingredients of the dream and he uses impeccable instinct in crafting something like \\"stills\\" from the fractured narratives that we normally experience nocturnally and unconsciously...he creates these dreams while illustrating today's fashions for their potential buyers. A dream can make you conquer a new land or buy a new hat or a painting or a philosophy. Aldridge knows that dreams are an exquisite tapestry of right and wrong, a chain of happenings in which what is \\"right,\\" that is what is logical or normal, conflicts with what is wrong, what defies our waking order of things, our expectations and sensibility. Dreams disrupt what is perceived as reality. Dreams happen to some people. And some people make them happen. — Glenn O'Brien, from Introduction to Acid Candy * Miles Aldridge is a director at heart. His images are anything but portraits of a subject. They are his actors, his actresses...Each photograph has a very sacred pathology to every angle and obsession to detail. There is genius in the very deliberate blankness on the face of the models than enables a transference of identity. He always draws you into an arrested fetish that seems as forbidden as a little girl's diary. — Marilyn Manson, from Introduction to The Cabinet * In his acid-coloured images of lascivious lips, impossibly glossed models and hallucinogenic still lives, the photographer Miles Aldridge is plainly heir to some of the twentieth century's enduring pop culture visionaries. David Lynch's surreal stylisation and interest in moths, the carefully staged elegance of Richard Avedon and the psychedelic graphic design of Alan Aldridge are all in there. — Skye Sherwin, Art Review April 2009  References  External links  Miles Aldridge on Models.com * Gallery at Christophe Guye Galerie Category:English music video directors Category:Photographers from London Category:Living people Category:1964 births ","title":"Miles Aldridge"},{"id":"33926180","text":"The list of shipwrecks in November 1939 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during November 1939. 1 November 3 November 4 November 6 November 9 November 10 November 12 November 13 November 14 November 15 November 16 November 17 November 18 November 19 November 20 November 21 November (Look 10/12/1939) 22 November 23 November 24 November 25 November 26 November 27 November 28 November 29 November 30 November Unknown date References 1939-11 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in November 1939"},{"id":"33926183","text":"Andrew Lauder was a Burgess.

Around 1455 they were forfeited to the crown. Finnart was given to the Hamiltons, while the western part of the barony of Finnart went to Stewart of Castlemilk and became the barony of Finnart-Stewart, or Gourock. Sir James Hamilton of Finnart inherited the barony and rose to high office, but was beheaded and his estates forfeited, with his Finnart lands going to Shaw of Sauchie and Greenock. These estates subsequently became the west end of Greenock. The northern part of the Finnart-Stewart estates forms the main part of modern Gourock, while the remainder now accommodates the housing estates of south-west Greenock. Location The Douglas lands of Finnart lay west of the barony of Greenock, the boundary being \\"the Hole or West-burn\\": the burn is culverted under the modern town centre at Westburn Street, immediately to the west of The Oak Mall indoor shopping centre, and from there flows into the River Clyde which formed the northern boundary. The southern boundary was the glen leading to Inverkip; the West Burn flows down this valley, close to the line of the A78 trunk road. The area now includes Greenock West, as well as the Bow Farm housing estate.Current street maps related to: Wood, John, ca. 1780-1847, Plan of the Town of Greenock from actual survey, Imprint: [Edinburgh : J. Wood], 1825; National Library of Scotland. The parish boundary with Gourock divided Easter Finnart from Finnart-Stewart (or Wester Finnart), which \\"extended from Achaneich to Achamead\\". The former Aughneagh House was sited adjacent to Fancy Farm, just to the west of the former municipal boundary: its location is marked by Aughneagh Road, which runs north west from the A78 Inverkip Road: the area is now a Greenock housing estate. The farms of Aughmead and West Aughmead were sited about further west. They lay to the west of Aughmead Road which runs north Inverkip Road, and were in the area of the modern south-west Greenock housing estates of Larkfield and Braeside, which both lie to the south of the current boundary with Gourock itself.Current street maps related to: OS One-inch to the mile maps of Scotland, 1st Edition, 1856-1891 Sheet 30 - Glasgow, surveyed 1855-1861, published 1890; Ordnance Survey Maps Six-inch 2nd and later editions, Scotland, 1892-1960, Renfrewshire Sheet I.NW & NE and Renfrewshire Sheet I.SE, National Library of Scotland. The Rev. Macrae's Notes About Gourock of 1880 includes a rough map showing the boundaries of Gourock estate including both Aughneagh and Braeside, and extending over the Inverkip road as far as Loch Thom. The map shows the western boundary as the Mile Burn. The notes quote Crawfurd's 1782 History of the Shire of Renfrew referring to a walk-mill called \\"Elie-mill\\" as \\"lying within the barony of Gourock\\". The mill site lies a short distance to the east of West Aughmead farm, on the location of the modern street named Aileymill Gardens., see also Renfrewshire Sheet I.SE History The extensive landholdings of the Earl of Douglas included the lands of Finnart, which lay to the west of the barony of Greenock. As a result of disputes with King James II of Scotland, the lands and estates of James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas, were forfeited to the crown in 1455. In 1457 the king gave Finnart to the Hamilton family. The western portion of the Finnart estates was given by the king to Sir Archibald Stewart of Castlemilk, and subsequently became the barony of Finnart-Stewart, which had its seat at Gourock castle. In 1510 James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran, passed the Finnart estate on to his natural son who became Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, though still widely known as \\"The Bastard of Arran\\". Finnart rose to a powerful place as head of the Hamilton family, and was appointed to a series of high positions by King James V of Scotland. In 1540 Finnart abruptly fell from favour with the king and was executed, with his lands forfeit to the crown. King James V then bestowed the lands of Finnart on Alexander Shaw of Sauchie and Greenock, who passed them together with the barony of Wester Greenock on to his son John Shaw in 1542. In 1669 his descendant John Shaw bought the barony of Easter Greenock from the Crawfords, and the conjoined baronies were inherited in 1752 by John Shaw Stewart. The lands remain under the Shaw Stewart baronets.

It is umbilicated, elongate-ovate conic, semitransparent, polished. The 2½ whorls of the protoconch are moderately large, helicoid, elevated, about one-fifth immersed in the first of the succeeding whorls and having their axis at a right angle to them. The five whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, angulated at the periphery and weakly shouldered at the summit; the latter falls somewhat anterior to the periphery of the preceding whorl and lends to it a somewhat constricted appearance at the well-impressed suture. The whorls are marked by extremely fine, closely placed, wavy spiral striations, which are visible only under very high magnification. The periphery of the last whorl is somewhat angulated. The base of the shell is very broad, gently rounded, somewhat pinched at the narrow umbilicus. The aperture is elongate-ovate, somewhat prolonged at the junction of the outer lip and columella. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, somewhat effuse. The slender columella is decidedly curved, slightly revolute, provided with a prominent oblique fold at its insertion.

After working as a hairdresser, Wivell established himself as a society portrait painter before concentrating his efforts on fire safety measures. Art engraving by Wivell depicting Roger O'Connor holding a crown. O'Connor claimed to be the rightful king of Ireland Born in Marylebone, London, Wivell was forced to work from an early age after his father died leaving his mother in poverty.Abraham Wivell, Dictionary of National Biography (at Wikisource) He worked on a farm from the age of six, and did various jobs in London as a child. In 1799, he was apprenticed to a wigmaker, which at the time was part of normal hairdressing. After completing his seven-year apprenticeship, he set up his own hairdressing salon.National Portrait Gallery, Abraham Wivell. Initially an amateur artist, he advertised his skills by showing portrait miniatures he had painted in his hairdressing shop window. By this means he gained commissions for portrait drawings and paintings, aided by the support of Joseph Nollekens and James Northcote. A drawing he created of Caroline of Brunswick, wife of King George IV, appealed to the queen herself, who gave Wivell a personal sitting. His link to the queen soon helped him achieve fame as an artist. When she was put of trial for adultery in the House of Lords, Wivell sneaked in among the lawyers and made sketches of the leading figures involved. These were published to illustrate the sensational case. The popular feeling in favour of Caroline led to good sales. Wivell later depicted other figures in the news, including Arthur Thistlewood, a leader of the Cato Street conspiracy. Wivell subsequently became an established society portraitist, painting royalty and aristocracy. He also painted nearly 200 portraits of MPs for a view depicting the House of Commons in session, which was published as a print. Most of Wivell's portraits were highly finished works in pencil, though he did paint some oils and attempted to make some etchings. After visiting Stratford-upon-Avon to make a study of the tomb sculpture of Shakespeare, Wivell decided to create an illustrated study of all known portraits of the poet. In 1827 Wivell published the work under the title An inquiry into the history, authenticity, & characteristics of the Shakspeare portraits. As well as a collection of prints, the book presented a detailed examination of purported Shakespeare portraits. The book also replied the arguments of an earlier work by James Boaden.Wivell, Abraham, An inquiry into the history, authenticity, & characteristics of the Shakspeare portraits: in which the criticisms of Malone, Steevens, Boaden, & others, are examined, confirmed, or refuted. Embracing the Felton, the Chandos, the Duke of Somerset's pictures, the Droeshout print, and the monument of Shakspeare, at Stratford; together with an exposé of the spurious pictures and prints, 1827, p.56. Unfortunately, Wivell lost a great deal on money on the venture, as the cost of printing such a richly illustrated work far exceeded the sales. However, he was saved financially by the death of his uncle, Abram Wivell of Camden Town, who left him his house and furniture and an lifetime annuity of £100. Fire protection \\"Abraham Wivell's improved fire escape\\". An illustration in The Leisure Hour depicting Wivell's fire escape in action In the 1820s Wivell turned his attention to fire protection, arguing, along with others, that the private fire brigades of the time were more concerned with protecting property than human life. Several voluntary groups sprung up dedicated to solving this problem. In 1836 the \\"Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire\\" was created with Wivell in charge of developing techniques for helping people escape from burning buildings.Biography of Abraham Wivell, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery Wivell designed a portable fire escape, which could be brought to buildings and erected rapidly. He created demonstration models of the design to illustrate a series of lectures on fire-fighting that he gave in 1836. The ladder was mounted on a wheeled chariot. Once at the scene, a fly ladder was swung into position with ropes. A rescued person could be quickly passed down through a canvas chute that hung below the ladder, allowing a rapid flow of escapees. 85 fire escape stations were established in London by the society containing escape ladders on the Wivell design. Other cities also acquired Wivell's design. Later life He resigned his position with the society in 1841 after a dispute, and moved to Birmingham, where he resumed his artistic career. In 1847 he endorsed the authenticity of the newly discovered Ashbourne portrait, which was claimed to depict Shakespeare.William L. Pressly, \\"The Ashbourne Portrait of Shakespeare: Through the Looking Glass\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, 1993, p.56. In 1849 he died of Bronchitis in Birmingham. Wivell was married twice and had fourteen children. He was survived by ten of his children. His oldest son, also called Abraham Wivell, was also a successful painter.

He was the fourth son of the Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel and his second wife Juliane of Nassau- Dillenburg.  Life  When the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg was established in 1627, Herman took up the regency in Rotenburg. In Waldeck on 31 December 1633 Herman married firstly Countess Sophie Juliane of Waldeck (b. Altenwildungen, 1 April 1607 - d. Ziegenhain, 15 September 1637). She was the daughter of Christian, Count of Waldeck. They had one daughter: *Juliane (b. Kassel, 25 March 1636 - d. Kassel, 22 May 1636). In Weimar on 2 February 1642 Herman married secondly Princess Kunigunde Juliane of Anhalt-Dessau (b. Dessau, 17 February 1608 - d. Rotenburg, 26 September 1683), daughter of John George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. This marriage was childless. Herman suffered all his life from a crippled foot and had to wear iron braces to support his leg. This made a military career impossible. Instead, he went into the scientific field. He became a renowned researcher in the fields of meteorology, mathematics, astronomy and geography. His treatise Beiläufige Cosmographische Beschreibung des Niederfürstentums Hessen of 1641 is among the standard works of 17th century Hessian geography. The school in Rotenburg was destroyed in 1637, during the Thirty Years' War. In 1651, Herman built a new school, at his own expense, at the address Löbergasse 2, as indicated by an inscription on the building. After additional territories had been acquired, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg was divided among three brothers in 1648. Herman retained a reduced Hesse-Rotenburg; Frederick received Hesse-Eschwege and Ernest received Hesse-Rheinfels. In 1655, Frederick died without a male heir, and Eschwege fell to Ernest. In 1658, Herman died without surviving issue and Rotenburg also fell to Ernest.

Note the complete Bouma sequence. A sediment gravity flow is one of several types of sediment transport mechanisms, of which most geologists recognize four principal processes. These flows are differentiated by their dominant sediment support mechanisms, which can be difficult to distinguish as flows can be in transition from one type to the next as they evolve downslope. Sediment support mechanisms Sediment gravity flows are represented by four different mechanisms of keeping grains within the flow in suspension. *Grain flow – Grains in the flow are kept in suspension by grain-to-grain interactions, with the fluid acting only as a lubricant. As such, the grain-to-grain collisions generate a dispersive pressure that helps prevent grains from settling out of suspension. Although common in terrestrial environments on the slip faces of sand dunes, pure grain flows are rare in subaqueous settings. However, grain-to-grain interactions in high-density turbidity currents are very important as a contributing mechanism of sediment support. *Liquefied/fluidized flow – Form in cohesionless granular substances. As grains at the base of a suspension settle out, fluid that is displaced upward by the settling generates pore fluid pressures that may help suspend grains in the upper part of the flow. Application of an external pressure to the suspension will initiate flow. This external pressure can be applied by a seismic shock, which may transform loose sand into a highly viscous suspension as in quicksand. Generally as soon as the flow begins to move, fluid turbulence results and the flow rapidly evolves into a turbidity current. Flows and suspensions are said to be liquefied when the grains settle downward through the fluid and displace the fluid upwards. By contrast, flows and suspensions are said to fluidized when the fluid moves upward through the grains, thereby temporarily suspending them. Most flows are liquefied, and many references to fluidized sediment gravity flows are in fact incorrect and actually refer to liquefied flows. *Debris flow or mudflow – Grains are supported by the strength and buoyancy of the matrix. Mudflows and debris flows have cohesive strength, which makes their behavior difficult to predict using the laws of physics. As such, these flows exhibit non-newtonian behavior. Because mudflows and debris flows have cohesive strength, unusually large clasts may be able to literally float on top of the mud matrix within the flow. *Turbidity current – Grains are suspended by fluid turbulence within the flow. Because the behavior of turbidity currents is largely predictable, they exhibit newtonian behavior, in contrast to flows with cohesive strength (i.e., mudlfows and debris flows). The behavior of turbidity currents in subaqueous settings is strongly influenced by the concentration of the flow, as closely packed grains in high-concentration flows are more likely to undergo grain-to-grain collisions and generate dispersive pressures as a contributing sediment support mechanism, thereby keep additional grains in suspension. Thus, it is useful to distinguish between low-density and high- density turbidity currents. A powder snow avalanche is essentially a turbidity current in which air is the supporting fluid and suspends snow granules in place of sand grains. Resulting deposits Diagram showing debris flow, turbidity current and traction processes in a single sediment gravity flow. The resulting deposit, which some geologists call a linked debrite, exhibits features of all three processes. Description Although the deposits of all four types of sediment support mechanisms are found in nature, pure grain flows are largely restricted to aeolian settings, whereas subaqueous environments are characterized by a spectrum of flow types with debris flows and mud flows on one end of the spectrum, and high-density and low-density turbidity currents on the other end. It is also useful in subaqueous environments to recognize transitional flows that are in between turbidity currents and mud flows. The deposits of these transitional flows are referred to by a variety of names, some of the more popular being \\"hybrid-event beds (HEB)\\", linked debrites\\" and \\"slurry beds\\". Powder snow avalanches and glowing avalanches (gas-charged flows of super heated volcanic ash) are examples of turbidity currents in non-marine settings. * Grain flow deposits are characterized by a coarsening-upward distribution of grain sizes (inverse grading) within the bed. This results from smaller grains within the flow falling down in between larger grains during grain-to-grain collisions, and thereby depositing preferentially at the base of flow. Although present as grain avalanches in terrestrial sand dunes, grain flows are rare in other settings. However, inverse graded beds resulting from grain flow processes do make up so-called \\"traction carpets\\" in the lower intervals of some high- density turbidites. * Liquefied flow deposits are characterized by de-watering features, such as dish structures, that result from upward escaping fluid within the flow. As with pure grain flows, pure liquefied flows seldom occur on their own. However, liquefied flow processes are very important as grains within turbidity currents begin to settle out and displace fluid upwards. This dish structures and related features, such de-watering pipes, are often found in turbidites. * Debris flow deposits are characterized by a bimodal distribution of grain sizes, in which larger grains and/or clasts float within a matrix of fine-grained clay. Because the muddy matrix has cohesive strength, unusually large clasts may be able to float on top of the muddy material making up the flow matrix, and thereby end up preserved on the upper bed boundary of the resulting deposit. * Low-density turbidity current deposits (turbidites) are characterized by a succession of sedimentary structures referred to as the Bouma sequence, which result from decreasing energy within the flow (i.e., waning flow), as the turbidity current moves downslope. * High-density turbidity current deposits are characterized by much coarser grain size than in low-density turbidites, with the basal portions of the deposits often characterized by features that result from the close proximity of the grains to each other. Thus, indications of grain-to-grain interactions (i.e., grain flow processes), and interaction of grains with the substratum (i.e., traction) are generally present in the lower portions of these deposits. Complete Bouma sequences are rare, and generally only the Bouma A and B layers are evident. * Hybrid event beds (HEB) transitional between mud flows and turbidity currents are characterized by features indicative of both cohesionless (turbulence-supported) and cohesive (mud-supported) flow with no separating bed boundary between the two. In most cases, they are represented by grain-supported textures that grade upward within the bed into mud- supported textures. It is not uncommon for debris flows and mud flows to evolve downslope into turbidity currents, and vice versa. Also, flows internally may transition upward from one flow process to another.

Significance Sediment gravity flows, primarily turbidity currents, but to a lesser extent debris flows and mud flows, are thought to be the primary processes responsible for depositing sand on the deep ocean floor. Because anoxic conditions at depth in the deep oceans are conducive to the preservation of organic matter, which with deep burial and subsequent maturation through the absorption of heat can generate oil and gas, the deposition of sand in deep ocean settings can ultimately juxtapose petroleum reservoirs and source rocks. In fact, a significant portion of the oil and gas produced in the world today is found in deposits (reservoirs) originating from sediment gravity flows.

Mammalian sleep can be sub- divided into two distinct phases - REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans and cats, NREM sleep has four stages, where the third and fourth stages are considered slow-wave sleep (SWS). SWS is considered deep sleep, when metabolism is least active. Metabolism involves two biochemical processes that occur in living organisms. The first is anabolism, which refers to the build up of molecules. The second is catabolism, the breakdown of molecules. These two processes work to regulate the amount of energy the body uses to maintain itself. During non-REM sleep, metabolic rate and brain temperature are lowered to deal with damages that may have occurred during time of wakefulness. Normal metabolism  After eating, the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin signals muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose from food. As a result, blood glucose levels return to normal. Sleep deprivation and Type 2 diabetes Insulin-Resistant Metabolism Baseline levels of insulin do not signal muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose. When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. Blood sugar will then rapidly drop. This can progress to type 2 diabetes. Sleep loss can affect the basic metabolic functions of storing carbohydrates and regulating hormones. Reduction of sleep from eight hours to four hours produces changes in glucose tolerance and endocrine function. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center followed 11 healthy young men for 16 consecutive nights. The first 3 nights, the young men slept for the normal 8 hours. The next 6 nights, they slept for 4 hours. The next 7 nights, they spent 12 hours in bed. They all had the same diet. They found that there were changes in glucose metabolism that resemble that of type 2 diabetes patients. When the participants were tested after sleep deprivation, they took 40% longer than normal to regulate blood sugar levels after a high-carbohydrate meal. The secretion of insulin and the body's response to insulin decrease by 30%. Sleep deprivation also alters the productions of hormones, lowering the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and increasing blood levels of cortisol. It has also been shown that when slow-wave sleep was suppressed for three nights, young healthy subjects were 25% less sensitive to insulin. They needed more insulin to get rid of the same amount of glucose. If the body does not release more insulin to compensate, the blood-glucose levels will increase. This resembles impaired glucose tolerance, which can result in type 2 diabetes. Sleep deprivation and appetite control Sleep plays a vital role in regulating metabolism and appetite. When sleep deprived, the metabolic system will be out of balance, which will ultimately affect the dietary choices people make. Teens who are sleep deprived crave more carbohydrates. Sleep deprivation is a risk factor for obesity among young adults. There are two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, that are important in appetite control. Leptin, released by adipose tissue, is a hormone that inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure. Ghrelin, released from the stomach, is a hormone that increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Sleep deprivation can cause a 19% decrease in the level of leptin. Subjects were deprived of sleep for 2 nights (4 hours per night) and got compensation of sleep for the next 2 nights (10 hours per night). Leptin levels decreased by 18% and ghrelin levels increased by 28%. There was an increase in hunger level by 23 which is probably due to the reduction leptin level. Subjects also preferred high carbohydrate foods (sweets, salty food and starchy food). Craving for salty food increased by 45%. Sleep deprivation can cause people to intake food for emotional/psychological need rather than caloric need of the body. Chronic sleep deprivation (less than 8 hours of sleep) was associated with increase in body mass index (BMI). In the Wisconsin sleep cohort study of 1024 patients, the shorter sleep durations showed reduced levels of leptin and elevated levels of ghrelin. In a study with 3000 patients, it has been found that men and women who sleep less than 5 hours have elevated body mass index (BMI). In another study that followed about 70.000 women for 16 years, there was a significant increase in body weight in those who slept 5 hours or less compared to those who slept 7–8 hours. As sleep time decreased over time from the 1950s to 2000s from about 8.5 hours to 6.5 hours, there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity from about 10% to about 23%.

Although their primary mission was defending the homeland, the OTK also had the Warsaw Pact mission of transporting Soviet forces and supplies across Poland in wartime. Formed mainly from units shifted from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the OTK went under a new Inspectorate for National Territorial Defense in the Ministry of National Defense. The OTK included the Internal Defense Forces (, the largest unit) and several smaller territorial defense units. Immediately after World War II, the WOW's predecessor organization, the Internal Security Corps () had suppressed the Home Army, which had been loyal to the London government-in-exile; the KBW had also played a large part in suppressing the Poznan workers in 1956. The WOW, which totaled 65,000 troops in 1982, were equipped as mechanized infantry units, including tanks. The component units, which were organized at district level, had the missions of engaging hostile troops on Polish territory and eliminating local underground elements. The units were to receive the same individual training as regular ground forces, although they did not participate in large-scale coordinated exercises. By 1990 the WOW was not a credible military force. The organization included many nonmilitary patriotic and social groups, such as the boy scouts, and many military retirees found soft assignments in OTK units. Although the force had a military commander, it was not under the direct control of the Ministry of National Defense. By 1991 budget cuts were reducing personnel significantly, and plans called for transforming many OTK units into civil defense formations that would support production and service in the civilian economy. The OTK units remaining armed and attached to districts as regional defense forces would count as part of the ground forces' planned mid-1990s allotment of about 150,000 troops. They were to function as cadre units reinforcing operational ground forces within their territorial boundaries. Reduction of OTK units continued, and the last units of the OTK were converted to mechanized infantry units of the Polish Army by 1 July 2008. The military Border Protection Troops () was disbanded in 1991, and replaced by the Straż Graniczna, whose commander reports to the Prime Minister. The change resulted in personnel reductions from 21,000 in 1991 to 13,500.Curtis, p. 286 Sources : Glenn E. Curtis (ed.), Poland : a country study, p. 267, Washington: GPO, 1994. . * Steven J.

His lab’s work also elucidated how a mutational mechanism (microsatellite repeat slippage) plays a significant evolutionary role in functionally adjusting complex binding site arrangements that recruit poly-glutamine rich factors. Correspondingly, Erives lab has pioneered the identification of novel poly-glutamine complex recruiting enhancers that integrate developmental signals, while also identifying polyQ allelic series for key developmental factors targeting those enhancers. A significant implication of this work is that gene regulatory networks largely evolve by indels in both cis and trans (in enhancer DNAs and polyQ-encoding genes, respectively). As indels are largely produced by unstable microsatellite repeats, which are fast-evolving and difficult to genotype accurately, a large compartment of functional genetic variation is not treated by genome-wide association studies, which focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms and at most a subset of non-repeat associated indels.  Molecular determinants of morphogenic responses  Erives and colleagues determined how different morphogen gradient responses are encoded in DNA sequence. They did so by using diverse Drosophila species that have different sized eggs to study how a set of structured enhancers would have co-evolved or co-adapted to changes in the concentration gradients. Morphogen gradient systems are a core fundamental subject of developmental biology. Models of how morphogen gradient responses were encoded had previously been proposed but not tested across a set of unrelated enhancers constructed from a shared regulatory grammar and located throughout a genome. Three major unexpected findings resulted from this work. The first finding is that gradient responses in general do not evolve by changes in transcription factor (TF) binding site quality or quantity (site density) as expected, but rather by changes in the precise spacing between binding sites for morphogenic TFs and their partner TFs. The second finding is that homotypic site clustering at such enhancers was largely the result of a complex evolutionary history of selection for different threshold responses in the evolving insect egg. A third-related finding is that frequent selection for different responses also enriches for microsatellite repeat tracts, which are inherently unstable and most responsible for the production of novel indel alleles. Erives' work also showed the existence of inherent spatial-temporal conflict in morphogenic responses and how this is handled in nature via complementary morphogenic gradients.  Molecular determinants of the genetic code  Using insights gleaned from archaeal genomes, Erives elaborated and described a stereochemical model of \\"proto-anti-codon RNAs\\" (pacRNAs). The pacRNA model ascribes a predetermined combined origin for the universal genetic code (i.e., the codon table), the biogenic amino acids, and their exclusive homochirality in life. The model implies that early RNA world was an aminoacylated RNA world and that proteinogenic amino acids arose because of compatible interactions with nucleotide-based polymers. The pacRNA model explicitly lists possible interactions between various anti-codon di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide sequences and different amino acids. When the nucleotides are D-ribose based, L-amino acids are preferred. In the pacRNA world, codons originate as cis- elements for recruiting self-aminoacylated pacRNAs/proto-tRNAs. Thus, a curious aspect of this model is that the (anti-) codon table is determined in evolutionary history prior to the origin of ribosome-based protein translation. The pacRNA model may explain why extant tRNAs are heavily modified in all three domains of life. Erives first presented the pacRNA model at NASAs 2012 Astrobiology Science Conference2012 Astrobiology Science Conference. url: http://abscicon2012.arc.nasa.gov/ and most recently at the 2013 Iowa City Darwin Day festival,2013 Iowa City Darwin Day. url: http://icdarwin.org which focused on the origins of life on Earth. Like Erives' enhancer studies, which focus on how protein complexes interact with enhancer DNAs, his pacRNA work focuses on how biogenic amino acids would have beneficially interacted with the nucleotide-based molecules of early life. Both areas of study demonstrate how complex patterns in linear molecules emerge from interactions in 3-dimensions.  Developmental genetics in chordates  With his doctoral advisor Michael Levine, Erives authored several papers on ascidian developmental genetics, with key insights into the evolution of the proto-vertebrate body plan. This work used the Ciona system to generate copious amounts of embryos that were then electroporated with enhancer DNAs. In collaboration with Nori Satoh's lab at the University of Kyoto in Japan, where Erives spent a winter doing research, they also identified the largest collection of notochord specific genes by using genetically-altered Ciona over-expressing the Brachyury transcription factor. The notochord is a defining evolutionary innovation of the chordate body plan and this work was designed to advance understanding of the morphogenetic signals emanating from this important developmental and structural tissue.  CodeGrok, Inc.  In 2001, Erives co-founded the Caltech-associated company CodeGrok (code \\"grok\\") with Paul Mineiro , currently a Principal Research Software Developer for Microsoft. It was started in Pasadena, California but later moved to Berkeley, California after its second round of financing. In its first three years, CodeGrok developed and used machine learning methods to identify, classify, and clone transcriptional enhancers from the human genome and construct pathway-specific cell-based reporters for drug screening and other applications. The company took its name from the Robert Heinlein novel Stranger in a Strange Land and its concept of grok, which is to understand something deeply and intuitively, in reference to the goal of \\"grokking\\" the regulatory code of the human genome. While the company is no longer in existence, it is often cited as a humorous example of what not to do in naming a start-up company as many people were unable to pronounce the name.

It became a listed building on 31 October 1966. The original footprint of the church dates back to the 12th century, but the current building dates mostly from the 15th century. The church is mostly in a Perpendicular style, with a myriad of monuments and stained glass windows and a three-stage tower, which was added in the 15th century. The tower housed five bells, which were cast in 1628. Although the number of bells was increased to eight in the 20th century, the nearby house still retains its name of The Five Bells. Originally the nave was aisleless and shorter than it is now (). The north and south aisles were added around the 14th/15th centuries, as was the chancel, whereas the porch is entirely modern. Records show that the church (and the village) have a connection with the Pilgrim Fathers; at least three residents, Edward and Ann Tilley, and John and Joan Tilley. Both women died in the first winter. they took one of their nephews, Henry Samson, with them. Samson was baptized in St Mary's.

Plot summary Papa Smurf leaves the Smurf Village to visit Homnibus, and Brainy Smurf decides to clean Papa Smurf's lab to surprise him, but finds a book with the pages blank save for the page number. Suddenly, the book says \\"hello\\", which scares Brainy Smurf. The book then says it can answer any question, so Brainy Smurf asks Papa Smurf's age, to test the book. The book tells Brainy Smurf to check page 36, which isn't blank anymore, and says Papa Smurf is 542 years old, which Brainy Smurf recognises is right. After further confirming the book's knowledge, Brainy Smurf jumps happily, which calls Hefty Smurf's attention. Brainy Smurf tells him about the book, so Hefty Smurf asks the book how to become stronger, so the book sends him to page 13 where is the recipe for an ointment. Chef Smurf and Greedy Smurf hear about the book from Hefty Smurf, so Chef Smurf asks the recipe for a souffle, then Smurfette and Vanity Smurf hear Chef Smurf talking about the book, and so word is spread around the Smurf Village. Everybody goes to Brainy Smurf to ask questions to the book, until it depletes its energy and needs a rest before answering more questions. When Brainy Smurf takes the book to his house, the other Smurfs try to take it from him, but he asks the book for a way to avert others from using it, and the book sends him to page 88 where is a voice identification spell; now Brainy Smurf is the book's guardian and nobody can ask a question without his approval (not even Jokey Smurf wearing glasses manages to trick the book). Brainy Smurf asks the book for a quiet place where he could attend the Smurfs' questions in an ordered way, and the book guides him to the Old Tower. It needs some repairs, so Brainy Smurf asks Handy Smurf for help, and the other Smurfs help Handy Smurf in order to get into Brainy Smurf's good graces. Brainy Smurf names Clumsy Smurf as his assistant, since he's obedient and lacks malice. Handy Smurf and Hefty Smurf move Brainy Smurf's stuff to the tower. The following day, there is a long line of Smurfs at the tower's door. Each Smurf is guided by Clumsy Smurf, one at a time, through a long stair, and Brainy Smurf awaits upstairs, in a new costume, where he allows the corresponding Smurf to ask the book a question. After some time, dependence on the book escalates to a point where nobody does anything without asking the book first, and Smurfs do anything the book says; Potter Smurf digs another Smurf's garden because the book told him there was the best clay, and Vanity Smurf cuts flowers from Smurfette's garden because they are needed for a formula told by the book, for an ointment that erases wrinkles around the eyes. Flighty Smurf doesn't know what to ask to the book, until he leaves the tower and remembers he wanted to ask for a method to improve his memory. Another Smurf asks for a way to have Smurfette love him, and the book tells him Smurfette will love him if he gathers the qualities of all the Smurfs, and this makes Brainy Smurf realise that he should ban certain questions (because Smurfette should love him). Clumsy Smurf asks the book for a way to rest from his job guiding Smurfs through the stairs, and the book suggests he exchange places with Brainy Smurf from time to time, which Brainy Smurf dismisses as a joke, but at least offers to finish for that day after seeing one more Smurf. Then Jokey Smurf asks the book how could he ask it questions without Brainy Smurf being involved, so Brainy Smurf angrily closes the book and the tower is closed for the rest of the day. Chef Smurf makes lentil soup for all the Smurfs, while Brainy Smurf gets a pastry with morel mushrooms, and Clumsy Smurf (who, as the assistant, also has privileges), asks a piece of melon for dessert, but the \\"melon\\" is actually a pumpkin. Papa Smurf returns to the Smurf Village and finds the Smurfs have been using the Book That Tells Everything, and explains to Smurfette and Vanity Smurf that the book answers every question, yet without warning about the consequences of the solutions used (for example, Vanity Smurf's ointment did what the book said, but also gave him horrible button-shaped marks, so he's wearing a bag on his head, and the one that made Hefty Smurf stronger, now causes him so much pain that he needs crutches to walk). Papa Smurf goes to the Old Tower to explain Brainy Smurf that the book is causing catastrophe and sowing discord, but Brainy Smurf believes he is just jealous. Papa Smurf recognises he cannot convince the Smurfs that their dependence on the book is wrong, so he leaves the Smurf Village until they understand by themselves. Hefty Smurf, Smurfette and Vanity Smurf help Papa Smurf move into the cave of Mount Smurf. Smurfette returns to the cave from time to time to bring Papa Smurf some food. Another Smurf arrives at the cave with a sick Painter Smurf, who got intoxicated making paint of a new color recommended by the book. This Smurf decides to remain in the cave with Papa Smurf, not only to help attending Painter Smurf, but also because he asked the book for a deodorant to eliminate a strange odor from his house, but the deodorant's odor caused him nausea. Rain causes the dam to overflow. Papa Smurf discovers this and goes to the Old Tower to warn the Smurfs, but Brainy Smurf tells them that he will ask the book for a solution for the coming flood. However, the book needs a rest and everybody waits for it to recharge, much to Papa Smurf's chagrin. Then the dam breaks and everybody runs away, except for Brainy Smurf who gets caught by the flood. Smurfette tells Papa Smurf that she could not find Baby Smurf. Brainy Smurf, swimming while carrying the book, finds Baby Smurf on a little sliver of land in the torrent. Brainy Smurf doesn't know how to carry both Baby Smurf and book to safety, so he asks the book for help and it responds by telling him that it is too important and that he should give up Baby. Enraged by that prospect, Brainy tosses the book into the river before grabbing Baby Smurf and swimming to the shore. After everybody is safe, Papa Smurf talks to Brainy Smurf about how the book can make one losing his head, but in the end Brainy Smurf took the right decision. When another Smurf adds that it was convenient to have a book with every answer anyway, Brainy Smurf gets the idea of writing a wide ensmurfopedia encompassing all the knowledge of the Smurfs.

Morgan brought attention to the fact that the product contained bleach and was being illegally marketed as a \\"miracle\\" cure, which prompted a consumer warning across the European Union and earned Morgan a James Randi Award for Grassroots Activism. In 2011, Morgan again received media attention and acclaim, this time for his commentary on treatments offered by Stanislaw Burzynski, a controversial Texas-based physician who uses substances he calls \\"antineoplastons\\" as part of a non-approved alternative cancer therapy regimen. Morgan's critique provoked legal and personal threats from a public relations representative of the Burzynski Clinic, which in turn precipitated a hailstorm of criticism from the media, who defended Morgan, and prompted a public apology from the Clinic. In January 2012 Morgan was censured by his school for posting a Jesus and Mo cartoon as his Facebook profile for a week, in solidarity with University College London's Atheist, Secular, and Humanist Society. The school told him to remove the cartoon from his Facebook archive, and when he refused, threatened him with expulsion. Morgan spoke at the Rally for Free Expression in London on 11 February. Biography Rhys Morgan was born in 1994 and lives in Cardiff, Wales. He attended Cardiff High School, where he studied mathematics, chemistry, biology and psychology at AS level, before going on to study for a BSc (Hons) in Health Sciences with the Open University. Science activism  Miracle Mineral Supplement Rhys Morgan receiving the James Randi Award for Grassroots Activism (TAM London, 16 October 2010. Photo by Kelly Haddow). On the right is James Randi. Morgan first learned of Miracle Mineral Supplement (MMS) in 2010 after he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and, while researching his condition, came across the Crohn's Disease Forum, a website run by a patient support group. He noticed \\"a disturbing undercurrent of people trying to push alternative medicines to members\\". One of these was a product called Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS), which was being advertised with claims that it cured cancer, AIDS, malaria, and a variety of other medical conditions. Upon further research, Morgan came across warnings from the United States Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada indicating that MMS consisted of 28% bleach and advising consumers not to use it. Morgan and others began documenting sellers of MMS and reporting them to the relevant authorities in Britain, and he eventually addressed a public meeting of the Cardiff Council to win the backing of trading standards officers to highlight the dangers of MMS. These efforts eventually led the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to issue a warning across the European Union and put United Kingdom councils on alert over retail sales of MMS. FSA representative Hefin Davies said that Morgan's actions had been \\"very positive\\" in bringing the issue to the attention of authorities. He recounted his saga with MMS on the BBC's The One Show, and on podcasts such as The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Righteous Indignation, and Token Skeptic. For his efforts in raising awareness about MMS, Morgan was presented with the James Randi Award for Grassroots Activism at The Amaz!ng Meeting (TAM) in London in October 2010, and received a standing ovation from the meeting's attendees. Burzynski Clinic and antineoplastons In November 2011, a music writer and editor for the British newspaper The Observer sought help raising £200,000 to have his four-year-old niece, who had been diagnosed with a glioma (a type of brain cancer), receive treatment at the Burzynski Clinic, a controversial cancer treatment facility in Texas operated by physician Stanislaw Burzynski. Several bloggers, including Morgan, reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the Clinic's treatments, and had died, and challenged the validity of Burzynski's antineoplaston therapy. Marc Stephens, identifying himself as a representative of the Burzynski Clinic, sent emails to Morgan accusing him of libel and demanding that coverage of Burzynski be removed from his site. Stephens accompanied the legal threats with a Google Maps satellite image of the teenager's house. In response, Morgan posted Stephens' emails on his blog and defended his original assessment as well as the importance of open dialogue in the evaluation of scientific research. The threats against Morgan prompted a media backlash against Stephens and the Burzynski Clinic, as reporters from Discover Magazine, Houston Press, and The Guardian covered the story and defended Morgan's critique. The Guardian's Comment is Free section also featured an opinion piece written by Morgan in which he reiterated his position on Burzynski's therapy and argued that the Burzynski Clinic was using libel laws to silence critics of its cancer treatment and stifle debate about the validity of the Clinic's scientific methodology, the so-called chilling effect. Following the publicity fallout in response to Stephens' threats, the Burzynski Clinic issued a press release on 29 November confirming that the Clinic had hired Stephens \\"to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning Dr. Burzynski and the Clinic\\". The press release included an apology for Stephens' comments and for the posting of Morgan's personal information, and announced that Stephens \\"no longer has a professional relationship with the Burzynski Clinic.\\" The story, including the threats against Morgan, was covered by the British Medical Journal, which referred to him as a health blogger. The chief clinician at Cancer Research UK expressed his concern at the treatment offered, and Andy Lewis of the Quackometer and science writer Simon Singh, who was previously sued by the British Chiropractic Association, said that English libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine, and thus public health.

It became a listed building on 20 February 1954. History  Pre-16th Century  Pilgrims were originally attracted to a holy well on the site during the 10th century. The first church was built in the 12th century, though was rebuilt in the 15th century into the form it is today.  19th Century  In the 19th century, the canal and railway revolutions meant those living in Old Linslade moved to the current area of Linslade, adjoined with Leighton Buzzard. In 1868, the bells from the Church of St Mary were moved to St Barnabas in Linslade upon completion of its tower. The south porch of the church dates from restorations made in the 19th century.  20th Century  On 20 February 1954 the church became a Grade I listed building.  21st Century  In the late 2010s a wooden toilet block was installed on the site, situated on the south-east facing side of the church. It is a separate structure from the church itself. Architecture The church consists of a chancel, nave, west tower and south porch. The chancel is 24 feet long by 12 feet. The nave adds around 45 feet in length and 19 feet in width. The tower is around 35 feet high, the base being 10 feet by 11 feet wide.  Porch and Doorways  The outer doorway is under a square head with quatrefoil designs in the spandrels. The south doorway under the porch, leading into the church, dates from the 15th century. In the east wall of the porch is a holy water stoup, dating from the 16th century. A doorway on the north side of the church is blocked, likely in restorations around 1897-8. In restorations during 1876 the north doorway was in use and given a porch.  Tower and Bells  A semi-octagonal stair turret can be accessed from inside the church, leading up the west tower's north-east corner. In 1868, the original bells were transferred to St Barnabas in Linslade upon completion of the church's tower, leaving only one bell in the Church of St Mary. Surrounding area The church site is situated less than 100 metres from the Grand Union Canal, which was built around it due to the site being on slightly higher ground. The nearest pub, The Globe Inn, is around 500 metres south- east, and can be easily reached from the church by following the canal. The site is less than 2km from the 400 acre (160ha) Rushmere Country Parks of Heath and Reach to the north, and a similar distance from Leighton Buzzard High Street to the south-east.

The case was decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in an appeal affirming a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada.  The collision between HMS Dragon and the Maplebranch  On August 13, 1934, under the command of Captain Frederic Wake-Walker was entering the Market (or Victoria) Basin in the harbour of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After entering the basin, it attempted to avoid colliding into the Saguenay Trader, but it subsequently collided with an oil bunkering steamer, the Maplebranch, which was securely moored at the time of the collision. The Maplebranch sank.. The owners of the Maplebranch sued Wake-Walker for the damages to the Maplebranch and its cargo. Decisions of the Canadian courts  Exchequer Court  The admiralty action was heard by Mr. Justice Demers of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Quebec Admiralty District), assisted by two nautical assessors. The plaintiffs alleged that the collision was caused solely by the improper and negligent navigation and mismanagement of Dragon by Wake-Walker. In his defence, Wake-Walker pleaded inevitable accident, said to be caused by the maneuvering of the Saguenay Trader, which Wake-Walker was trying to avoid hitting. On June 21, 1935, Demers J. held that Wake-Walker was liable. Supreme Court of Canada On a 3-2 majority, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the finding of liability. In his opinion for the majority, Davis J. held that when a vessel under steam collides with a moored vessel, the commander of the vessel under steam is presumed liable for the collision, and has the onus of proving that he was not negligent. Wake-Walker had not done so. In summary, the majority stated:  Appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  Wake-Walker's appeal was dismissed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The opinion was delivered by Viscount Sankey which noted: Therefore, the Privy Council agreed with the courts below that Wake-Walker had not discharged the onus to prove that the accident had been inevitable.  Subsequent career  Vice Admiral Sir W Frederic Wake-Walker, Third Sea Lord, 1944 In spite of the finding of liability, Wake-Walker continued to rise in the Royal Navy. Promoted to rear-admiral in 1939, he was involved in Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940. Ships under his command played a key role in hunting the Bismarck in 1942, and he was heavily involved in creating the flotilla of landing craft needed for Operation Torch in North Africa, and later the Normandy landings on D-Day.

In addition, she still works as an Active Senior Judge, Mediator, Arbitrator and a faculty member of the National Judicial College.  Early life and education  Born and raised in Utah, Billings earned a B.A. in English from The University of Utah in 1965. Billings graduated magna cum laude and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Following her undergraduate education at the University of Utah Billings obtained a J.D. from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah in 1977. In law school she was an Associate Editor of Law Review and a member of the Order of the Coif. Billings earned her L.L.M. at University of Virginia Law School in 1990.  Professional career  After completion of law school, Billings was admitted to the Utah State Bar and Utah Federal Bar in 1977 and, eventually, the Supreme Court of the United States in 1989. Her first job as a lawyer was as a trial lawyer and partner with Ray, Quinney & Nebeker, where she worked from 1976 to 1982. She litigated commercial, banking, corporate, employment, construction, products liability, securities and insurance cases in state and federal courts. Cases for the Utah Court of Appeals varied from civil, criminal, administrative and domestic cases. Throughout her career, Judge Billings has also served as a Chair of the Appellate Judges Conference of the American Bar Association and President of the National Association of Women Judges.

In 1995, she received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah.See fn 3, supra Selected Billings Rulings Below is a list of some of Billings' rulings throughout her career: K.A.M. v. State, 2004 Ut. Ct. App 48 (2004) In K.A.M. vs. State Judges; Billings, Greenwood and Orme reaffirmed the ruling of the Juvenile Court that K.A.M.s name will remain in the licensing database maintained by the Department of Child and Family Services (DFCS) The case involved a parent that spanked their child and left a visible mark of the disciplinary action for more than 24 hours. The petitioner argued that since corporal punishment was legal that any restrictions on that punishment infringes upon \\"parental rights.\\" The court affirmed the ruling of the Juvenile Court which used the following standard set by the DFCS: \\"whether, by clear and convincing evidence, a child has 'suffered or been threatened with nonaccidental physical or mental harm.\\" Boyer v. Boyer, 2011 UT App. (2011) The Court of Appeals, in an opinion authored by Judge Billings, affirmed the trial court's award of diminishing monthly alimony for a time period less than the length of the marriage as well as affirming a property division where there were certain assets that were not divided equally. Wife appealed the trial court's ruling that certain specific assets that were not divided equally. In affirming, the Court of Appeals noted that the goal of a property division is to receive a fair result between the parties. In awarding property, a court should determine which property is marital along with its value. The court should then divide the property equally unless it finds exceptional circumstances to do otherwise. Wife asserted that the trial court erred because it failed to divide certain marital property equally. The Court of Appeals held that a trial court is not required to divide each piece of property equally, but it can look to the marital estate in its entirety and divide the entire estate in a manner that best facilitates a clean break between the parties. The Court noted that husband had assumed all the marital deb and that the trial court made a specific finding that considering the debt, the property division was equitable. Wife also appealed her alimony award on two grounds: first that the trial court erred by not adjusting alimony (presumably an upward adjustment) based upon husband's fault and second that the court erred by awarding her diminishing alimony for a time less than the length of alimony. The Court of Appeals rejected wife's claim regarding fault by merely pointing out that the statute sets forth that a trial court may consider fault but is not required to consider fault. The Court of Appeals then considered the diminishing alimony award under a two part analysis: was it a prospective change to a traditional alimony award or was it rehabilitative alimony? The Court noted that making future adjustments to a traditional alimony award is generally only justified when the anticipated event is certain, such as reductions in child support increasing alimony by a similar sum. The Court indicated that if the event is not certain then the trial court would be in a better position to consider the event at the time of the event. Rehabilitative alimony on the other hand is designed to assist the recipient spouse in the transition to self-sufficiency. The Court remanded to the trial court to clarify whether it had made future adjustments to a traditional alimony award or awarded rehabilitative alimony and required the trial court to clarify the time of the alimony given that there was a mathematical error in the trial court's order.

The website purportedly undertook political investigative journalism, but is now primarily known (together with its editor Mark Watts) for its direct involvement in the false allegations of sexual abuse put forward by \\"Nick\\" (Carl Beech) in Operation Midland. Introduction Launched in October 2011, Exaro, under its motto \\"Holding Power to Account\\", claimed to be specialising in \\"carrying out in-depth investigations\\". The website claimed to 'set out to produce \\"evidence-based, open-access journalism – not spin, not churnalism, not hacking – just journalism about what should be transparent but isn't\\"'. Exaro was reportedly set up by City entrepreneur Jerome Booth. In articles by journalist Mark Conrad, Exaro became the first publication to report claims made by Carl Beech (under the pseudonym \\"Nick\\") that a paedophile ring composed of powerful individuals had abused children at Elm Guest House in Barnes in the late 1970s and early 1980s. MP Tom Watson (Labour), having been passed information from Exaro journalists, raised the allegations in parliament. Police subsequently launched a scoping exercise under the name \\"Operation Fairbank\\"; later, a full-scale criminal investigation specifically addressing allegations relating to Elm Guest House was launched under the name \\"Operation Fernbridge\\". The latter investigation was subsequently closed after no evidence to support the claims were found. False allegations of sex crimes and murder committed by the fictional paedophile ring made by Beech later became the basis for the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland, a £2m probe which closed in 2016 with no charges being brought. A later inquiry found that those accused were victims of false allegations, and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner issued an apology to Beech's victims. In July 2019, Beech was convicted of charges related to his false claims and was jailed for eighteen years. Former MP Harvey Proctor (Conservative), whose home was raided as part of the failed investigation, charged that Exaro acted as Beech's \\"support team\\". Exaro's then-editor-in-chief, Mark Watts, stood by the website's coverage and said they \\"never asserted\\" that Beech's claims were true, but also called Beech's conviction 'wholly unsafe' because he did not think Beech got a fair trial after the judge had allowed jurors to hear that he had pleaded guilty to child pornography offences in a separate trial. Former MP John Hemming (Liberal Democrats), who had been falsely accused of abuse in an article by Exaro journalist David Hencke, succeeded in a libel action against him in January 2019, resulting in Hencke and Graham Wilmer of the Lantern Project paying over £10,000 in compensation for the false allegations. In August 2019, Staffordshire Police confirmed that they were investigating whether Hemming's accuser, Esther Baker, had misled detectives. Other investigations Civil service tax avoidance On 1 February 2012, an investigation by Exaro revealed that the UK's Student Loans Company was paying its chief executive, Ed Lester, through a private company, enabling him to reduce his tax bill by tens of thousands of pounds. The day after the story broke the Chief Secretary of the Treasury, Danny Alexander, was summoned to the House of Commons for an urgent debate. Alexander announced a review of all civil service contracts. Rupert Murdoch In partnership with Channel 4 News, Exaro revealed secretly recorded tapes of News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch talking to journalists from the News-owned The Sun newspaper, in which he criticised the \\"incompetent cops\\" who handled the News of the World phone hacking case and promised to take care of any Sun journalist that had broken the law.Revealed: The Rupert Murdoch Tape Military intervention in Syria In July 2011, a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) expert told Exaro that the chances of a foreign military incursion into Syria to secure chemical weapons had risen to \\"more than 50 per cent\\". That same month, Exaro also reported that hawks in the US government were pressing for military intervention to topple the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Bribery in defence contracts In August 2012, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a criminal investigation into bribery allegations in connection with a UK-Saudi Arabian defence contract between the EADS subsidiary GPT Special Project Management, and the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Exaro persistently investigated the allegations, writing more than twenty stories over seven months before the SFO launched its criminal investigation. Criticism Private Eye magazine wrote on 18 September 2015 that \\"Exaro is struggling to live up to its strapline of 'holding power to account.' For several months the investigative site has published no news at all apart from the latest paedo developments and, slightly bizarrely, items on a corporate insolvency monitoring service it runs alongside its 'news.' The latter centres on the supposed 'Whitehall paedophile ring' and the lurid allegations against former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, and involves magnifying the slightest procedural development and tweeting like mad under the hashtag #VIPaedophile.\\"Private Eye No 1401 (18 September 2015), p. 8. Barrister Matthew Scott, a consistent critic of Exaro's modus operandi, wrote on his blog that the site \\"has generated a poisonous atmosphere of outrage and hysteria in which wild and immensely hurtful accusations can be made and believed on the flimsiest of evidence; and that by publicising detailed allegations of paedophile orgies and murder it has risked destroying the prospect of fair trials either for victims or defendants.\\"Exaro: Spare us the sanctimony, spare us the bullying and try to be a bit more transparent, BarristerBlogger, 3 December 2014 A report in The Guardian stated that the conduct of Exaro had been the subject of complaints to officials supporting the Goddard Inquiry into child abuse. Dame Janet Smith called Exaro's editors \\"irresponsible\\" following the site's publication of a leaked draft copy of her report into child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile, stating that, “Exaro’s decision appears to have been taken for its own commercial gain without any thought for the interests of the many victims of Savile or the integrity of the reporting process.” References Category:Conspiracy theories Category:False allegations of sex crimes Category:British political blogs Category:British news websites Category:Internet properties established in 2011 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2016 ","title":"Exaro"},{"id":"33926622","text":"300px Church of St Mary the Virgin is a Grade I listed church in Northill, Bedfordshire, England.

One of the most influential French photographers of the 19th century,Adolphe Braun (1812–1877) , Southeast Museum of Photography website. Retrieved: 1 December 2011. he used contemporary innovations in photographic reproduction to market his photographs worldwide. In his later years, he used photographic techniques to reproduce famous works of art, which helped advance the field of art history.Naomi Rosenblum, John Hannavy (ed.), Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Vol. 1 (Routledge, 2007), pp. 203–204. Life Braun was born in Besançon in 1812, the eldest child of Samuel Braun (1785-1877), a police officer, and Marie Antoinette Regard (born 1795). When he was about 10, his family relocated to Mulhouse, a textile manufacturing center in the Alsace region along the Franco-German border. He showed promise as a draftsman, and was sent to Paris in 1828 to study decorative design. In 1834, he married Louis Marie Danet, who he had three children with: Marie, Henri, and Louise. That same year, Adolphe, alongside his brother Charles, opened the first of several unsuccessful design partnerships. After several unsuccessful design ventures in the 1830s, he published a successful collection of floral designs in 1842. Upon the premature death of his wife 1843, Braun sold his Paris studio and moved back to Mulhouse, where he became chief designer in the studio of Dollfus-Ausset, which provided patterns for textiles. He remarried to Pauline Melanie Petronille Baumann (1816-1885) on 12 December 1843 and had two more children with her; son Paul Gaston and daughter Marguerite. In 1847, he opened his own studio in Dornach, a suburb of Mulhouse. One of Braun's early Flower studies (1855) In the early 1850s, Braun began photographing flowers to aid in the design of new floral patterns.Helmut Gernsheim, The History of Photography from the Camera Obscura to the Beginning of the Modern Era (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1969), p. 291. Making use of the recently developed collodion process, which allowed for print reproduction of the glass plates, he published over 300 of his photographs in an album, Fleurs photographiées, in 1855. These photographs caught the attention of the Paris art community, and Braun produced a second set for display at the Paris Universal Exposition that same year. In 1857, Braun formed a photography company, Braun et Cie, and with the help of his sons, Henri and Gaston, and several employees, set about taking photographs of the Alsatian countryside. These were published in 1859 in L’Alsace photographiée, and several were displayed at the 1859 Salon. By the 1860s, the Braun et Cie studio was operating in a factory-like manner, producing all of its own materials except paper. The studio created thousands of stereoscopic images of the Alpine regions of France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Braun also produced a number of large-format panoramic images of the Alpine countryside, using the pantoscopic camera developed by English inventors John Johnson and John Harrison. In the mid-1860s, Braun invested in a new carbon print method developed by English chemist Joseph Wilson Swan.Gernsheim, p. 339. In 1867, Braun used the new carbon method to create a series of large-format hunting scenes entitled, Panoplies de gibier. He also used the new carbon print method to produce photographs of well-known works of art at places such as the Louvre, the Vatican, and the Albertina, as well as various sculptures in France and Italy. This endeavor proved successful, and Braun focused primarily on art reproductions for the remainder of his career. After his death in 1877, his son, Gaston, continued operating Braun et Cie into the 20th century. Works Photographs Wellhorn and the Rosenlaui Glacier, photographed by Braun circa 1860 Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum described Braun's work as representative of the relationship between art and commercialism in the mid-19th century. His self-sustaining Mulhouse studio helped elevate photography from a craft to a full-scale business enterprise, producing thousands of unique images which were reproduced and marketed throughout Europe and North America. Rosenblum also suggests that Braun's detailed reproductions of works of art in European museums brought these works to art students in North America, providing a major catalyst for the field of art history in the United States. Braun's early photographs were primarily of flowers, originally taken to complement his work as a pattern designer. Subsequent photographs focused on Alpine landscapes, especially lake scenes, and glacier scenes. Unlike many landscape photographers during this period, Braun liked to include people in his scenes. Photography historian Helmut Gernsheim suggested that Braun was one of the most skillful photographers of his era in rendering composition.Gernsheim, p. 250. While not known as a portraitist, he did take portraits of several notable individuals, including Pope Pius IX, Franz Liszt, and the Countess of Castiglione, mistress of Napoleon III.

It marks the site of the Kewawenon Mission, built in 1832, which was the birthplace of Indian Methodism in the western Upper Peninsula, and predated Frederic Baraga's mission at Assinins by 11 years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979. History Methodist missionaries arrived in this area, via Sault Ste Marie, in the first half of the 19th century. One of the earliest was John Sunday, a Chippewa pastor, who came to this site in 1832 and erected a log mission house. Reverend John Clark followed in 1834 and built a school and mission house. A number of other Methodist missionaries were assigned to what was then called the Kewawenon Mission, including Daniel Meeker Chandler, W.H. Brockway, George King, John Kahbeege, Peter Marksman, and John H. Pitezel. By 1845, the mission included a farm and church with over 60 members, the large majority of whom were Indian. A second church was built in 1850, and was dedicated by John H. Pitezel, who had served at Kewawenon from 1844 to 1847. The mission began holding annual camp meetings in 1880, which attracted a large number of Indians from all over. A third church was constructed in 1888 at a cost of $1400, funded by donations from non-church members. This building remains on the site. An outdoor chapel was built in 1924. Now known as the Zeba United Indian Methodist Church, the site has been in continuous operation since 1832, and represents one of the oldest and most successful integration of Christian and Native American religious traditions. Description The Zeba Indian United Methodist Church is a vernacular Gothic Revival building, built of wood in a rectangular plan. The front facade is asymmetric, with double colored glass windows on one side and an offset square tower holding the entrance doors on the other. The facade also includes a small gable peak window and a triangular window above the entry doors. Memorial windows line each side of the church and a large rosette window is in the rear. The polygonal steeple has Gothic slits in the belfry and a wrought iron top. The exterior is sided with the original handmade wooden shingles, arranged in linear patterns.

Based on this theory, things like color preference, preferred mate body ratios, shapes, emotional ties with objects, and many other aspects of the aesthetic experience can be explained with reference to human evolution.Wang, H.M., Chen, K. H., & Chou, G. J. 2011. 'Pleasurable elements in emotional design,' Designing Pleasurable Products and Interfaces.  Aesthetics and evolutionary psychology  Many animal and human traits have been argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. Evolutionary psychology extends this to psychological traits including aesthetical preferences. Such traits are generally seen as being adaptations to the environment during the Pleistocene era and are not necessarily adaptative in our present environment. Examples include disgust of potentially harmful spoiled foods; pleasure from sex and from eating sweet and fatty foods; and fear of spiders, snakes, and the dark.Dutton, Denis. 2003. 'Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology' in \\"The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics\\". Oxford University Press. All known cultures have some form of art. This universality suggests that art is related to evolutionary adaptations. The strong emotions associated with art suggest the same.  Landscape and other visual arts preferences  San Rafael Gran Sabana, Venezuela. An important choice for a mobile organism is selecting a good habitat to live in. Humans are argued to have strong aesthetical preferences for landscapes which were good habitats in the ancestral environment. When young human children from different nations are asked to select which landscape they prefer, from a selection of standardized landscape photographs, there is a strong preference for savannas with trees. The East African savanna is the ancestral environment in which much of human evolution is argued to have taken place. There is also a preference for landscapes with water, with both open and wooded areas, with trees with branches at a suitable height for climbing and taking foods, with features encouraging exploration such as a path or river curving out of view, with seen or implied game animals, and with some clouds. These are all features that are often featured in calendar art and in the design of public parks. A survey of art preferences in many different nations found that realistic painting was preferred. Favorite features were water, trees as well as other plants, humans (in particular beautiful women, children, and well-known historical figures), and animals (in particular both wild and domestic large animals). Blue, followed by green, was the favorite color. Using the survey, the study authors constructed a painting showing the preferences of each nation. Despite the many different cultures, the paintings all showed a strong similarity to landscape calendar art. The authors argued that this similarity was in fact due to the influence of the Western calendar industry. Another explanation is that these features are those evolutionary psychology predicts should be popular for evolutionary reasons.  Physical attractiveness  Various evolutionary concerns have been argued to influence what is perceived to be physically attractive.Carey, Bjorn. 2006. 'The Rules of Attraction in the Game of Love,' \\"Live Science.\\"\\" Such evolutionary based preferences are not necessarily static but may vary depending on environmental cues. Thus, availability of food influences which female body size is attractive which may have evolutionary reasons. Societies with food scarcities prefer larger female body size than societies having plenty of food. In Western society males who are hungry prefer a larger female body size than they do when not hungry.  Evolutionary musicology  Evolutionary musicology is a subfield of biomusicology that grounds the psychological mechanisms of music perception and production in evolutionary theory. It covers vocal communication in non- human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross- cultural human universals in musical ability and processing. It also includes evolutionary explanations for what is considered aesthetically pleasing or not.  Darwinian literary studies  Darwinian Literary Studies (aka Literary Darwinism) is a branch of literary criticism that studies literature, including aesthetical aspects, in the context of evolution.  Evolution of emotion  Aesthetics are tied to emotions. There are several explanations regarding the evolution of emotion. One example is the emotion disgust which has been argued to have evolved in order to avoid several harmful actions such as infectious diseases due to contact with spoiled foods, feces, and decaying bodies.  Sexy son hypothesis, handicap principle, and arts  A male peacock does its best to court a female, dancing and displaying its extravagant plumage. The sexy son hypothesis suggests that a female optimal choice among potential mates is a male whose genes will produce male offspring with the best chance of reproductive success by having trait(s) being attractive to other females. Sometimes the trait may have no reproductive benefit in itself, apart from attracting females, because of Fisherian runaway. The peacock's tail may be one example. It has also been seen as an example of the handicap principle. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what is needed for survival on the savanna. One explanation could be that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the equivalent of the peacock's tail for humans. According to this theory superior execution of art was important because it attracted mates.

Some sources give his first name as William instead of Owen, however, all sources agree on the prominent use of Graystone. The cause of confusion about the correct form of Bird's full name is unclear, but it does not seem to be a case of multiple photographers using the names \\"Graystone\\" and \\"Bird\\" in combination, contemporaneously. Born in Frome he was a member of the second-generation of a prominent family of pioneering photographers who relocated to the town of Bath, in England during the mid 1860s. His father, Frederic Charles Bird, a photographer and portrait painter active from the middle to late nineteenth century, had received a Royal Warrant of Appointment from the contemporary Prince of Wales, the future king Edward VII. The younger Bird would also receive this honour, although the limited records available are unclear about whether his patron, as Prince of Wales, was Edward VII or George V, or both. Bird was a skilled and respected artist, the winner of numerous photography prizes, whose talent was internationally recognised during his professional lifetime. Posthumously however, he slipped into relative obscurity, when compared to other notable photographers of the period. Aside from the simple passage of time, and the role of random-chance selection in the recognition of artistic talent, there appear to be two key reasons why Bird's work remains relatively unknown: * much of Bird's most notable work, created during a peak period of his career in the 1890s and very early 1900s, involved creating pictorialist-style photographic images for publication-and-use as magic lantern slides. This was, at the time, a popular form of entertainment in private homes and public shows. However, the development of moving pictures as a form of art and entertainment, beginning in the 1890s, would eclipse the popularity of magic- lantern shows in the early decades of the twentieth century. Also, the format of images recorded on large-sized glass slides, for use with magic-lantern- type projectors was superseded by \\"film slides\\" (i.e., image-transparencies recorded on small pieces of thin, flexible film; made either from a form of cellulose, or from more advanced sheet-plastic materials), and more modern types of still-image projectors. * the building, at 38, Milsom Street, Bath, which had housed the Bird family's studio-workshop for 73 years, and also contained the archives of their photographic work, was apparently destroyed in some catastrophic event in 1937 (details not specified in the available sources); Bird was still alive at the time, age 74-75. After the unspecified ' event' at Milsom Street, Graystone set up a new studio at 9, Sydney Place, Bath. Thus, by the middle of the twentieth century, the master copies of most of Bird's photographs had been destroyed, along with the related documentation; and among his surviving works, the most notable remaining were part of an obscure genre, stored in an obsolete and relatively fragile medium. Owen Graystone Bird died on 17 October 1943,Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette 23 October 1943, page 11 age 80. He had at least one child, a son, Charles Frederick Graystone Bird; also a photographer. His grandson, David Graystone Bird, is active in promoting awareness of the photographic work of his ancestors. The Keasbury-Gordon Photograph Archive, a commercial enterprise which specialises in early British photography, has a small collection of Graystone Bird photographs, and has produced a number of YouTube video documentaries about Bird and his work.

She is famous for her participation in the vodou ceremony at Bois Caïman, which is considered to be one of the starting points of the Haitian Revolution. Early life and origins Cécile Fatiman was the daughter of an African slave woman and a white Frenchman from Corsica. She and her mother were sold as slaves at Saint Domingue, while her two brothers disappeared in the slave trade.Joan Dayan, Haiti, History, and the Gods, University of California Press, 1998 She is described as having long silky hair and green eyes. Haitian researcher Rodney Salnave (Bwa Kay Il-Ment) has researched Fatiman's origins. His research has indicated that her father was likely a Corsican prince and a grandson of Theodore Von Neuhoff or Theodore of Corsica, sole king of Corsica. He also believes that her last name, Fatiman, may actually have been a middle name, Attiman, which would have been given after Gregorio Attiman, of Leghorn or Livorno, Italy, who was one of Theodore Neuhoff's pages during his conquest of the Corsican throne in April 1736. This prompted him to state that her full name was most likely Cécile Attiman Coidavid, as she was the daughter of Célestina Coidavid, and the sister of Marie-Louise Coidavid, Queen of Haiti from 1811 to 1820. She was the mother-in-law of Pierre Nord Alexis.  Slave rebellion  In August 1791, Fatiman presided over a ceremony at the Bois Caïman in the role of mambo together with priest Dutty Boukman. Boukman prophesied that the slaves Jean François, Biassou, and Jeannot would be leaders of a resistance movement and revolt that would free the slaves of Saint-Domingue. An animal was sacrificed, an oath was taken, and Boukman and the priestess exhorted the listeners to take revenge against their French oppressors and \\"[c]ast aside the image of the God of the oppressors.\\"Charles Arthur and Michael Dash (eds), Libète: A Haiti Anthology (Princeton, NJ: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1999), 36.

The testimony by Wanda Bronskaya that Helmut Damerius wanted to recruit her for the Hitler Youth was fabricated.\\" He returned to working in theater, becoming the director of the Decorations Department of the Jambyl theater in 1955. In 1956, Damerius was allowed to leave the Soviet Union for the German Democratic Republic (GDR), but was warned not to speak or write of his experiences in the Soviet Union, under strict threat of punishment.  Final years in the GDR  After Damerius' return to the GDR, he became the head of the Concert and Guest Performance Direction, serving in that capacity from 1956 to 1960. From 1960 to 1961, he was the first director of the Artists' Agency, established to oversee and grant permission for East German artists to perform abroad and foreign artists to perform in East Germany. In 1960, he became head of the State Folk Art Ensemble in Berlin, retiring in 1963. From 1980 to 1982, he secretly worked on his memoirs, writing about the \\"years of his pointless arrest, the loss of the middle years of his life\\". He secretly gave his complete manuscript to Professor Werner Mittenzwei in 1982. Damerius died in East Berlin. His memoir, Unter Falscher Anschuldigung (\\"Under False Accusation\\"), was released posthumously in 1990.  Awards and honors  In his later years, Damerius was awarded several East German medals and honors. In 1963, Damerius received the Medal for Fighters against Fascism, in 1973, he received an award for 50 years of allegiance to the SED from its Central Committee; in 1975, he was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit; and in 1980, he received the art award of the Free German Trade Union Federation.

Domingos was the first Brazilian journalist to die in this type of crime setting in Brazil. Personal Information Domingos was 46 years old at the time of his death. He was married to Fabiana Domingo, and the couple had three children and 2 grandchildren at the time of his death. He was buried at the Memorial do Carmo, in Caju. Career Domingos was a TV camera operator for the radio and TV group Rede Bandeirantes, which is often referred to as TV Band for short. He was considered by the press freedom organizations to be a veteran and had previously worked at the Brazilian Television System, or Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (SBT), and the Record. Death Domingos was shot in the chest by a high caliber bullet and killed while covering a drug raid at the Antares favela. on the west side of Rio de Janeiro. What began that morning as a raid turned into a fierce shootout between the 80 military- trained soldiers who conducted the operation and the drug traffickers. Although Domingos was protected by a bullet proof vest during the operation, it was not of the strong quality that was used by the authorities. It is against Brazilian law for media personnel or others to wear the high-tech protection vests that the police and military wear. Police arrested 9 suspects, which included a minor, and believed that one of them was the gunman who killed Domingos, but four other suspects were killed, and it may have been one of them who killed Domingos. Police will be reviewing the video taken by Domingos to determine the killer.Pernambuco. \\"Autor do disparo que matou cinegrafista pode estar entre os mortos ou presos.\\" November 7, 2011.

She is remembered for retrieving and burying the mutilated body of Emperor Dessalines after his assassination at Pont Larnage.  Life  Dédée Bazile was born near Cap-Français to enslaved parents and made a living serving as a sutler to the army of Dessalines. There are varying accounts of her madness but according to legend, Dédée Bazile either developed mental illness after she was raped by her master at age 18, or after some of her family members were killed in the defeat of Dessalines’s army by General Donatien Rochambeau.  Assassination of Dessalines  On October 17, 1806, Emperor Dessalines was ambushed by his former comrades Alexandre Pétion, Jean-Pierre Boyer, André Rigaud, and Bruno Blanchet. He was fatally shot north of Port-au-Prince. His body was then brought into the city where it was stoned and mutilated by the crowds. \\"Pendant que de nombreux enfants, au milieu de grands cris de joie, criblaient de coups de pierre les restes infortunés de Dessalines, sur la place du Gouvernement, une vieille femme folle nommée Défilée vint à passer. Elle s'approcha de l'attroupement que formaient les enfants...On lui dit que c'était Dessalines. Ses yeux égarés devinrent calmes tout à coup; une lueur de raison brilla sur ses traits. Elle alla à la course chercher un sac, revint sur la place, y mit ses restes ensanglantés et les transporta au cimetière intérieur de la ville.

She approached the mob formed by the children... She was told that it was Dessalines. Her wild eyes suddenly became calm; a glimmer of reason shone across her features. She went and fetched a sack, came back to the Place, put his bloodied remains therein, and took them to the interior cemetery the town [of Port-au-Prince]. General Pétion sent along some soldiers who, for a modest sum, buried them.\\"Translated by a random reader Dédée Bazile, a fanatic admirer of Dessalines, gathered his remains in a sack and transported them to the Cimetière Intérieur to bury them.  Legacy  Dédée Bazile died around 1816 and was buried in Port-au-Prince, but her grave has been lost. She was survived by her several children including her son Colonel Condol Bazile, officer of the constabulary under the Haitian president Faustin Soulouque. She is considered one of the four symbolic heroines of the independence of Haiti, alongside Sanité Bélair, Catherine Flon, and Cécile Fatiman.

It appeared towards the end of the 19th century. It is made on Terre-de-Bas Island by some last craftsmen who still have the art and the technics of its making. Description Salako is the traditional headgear of people from les Saintes archipelago. Even if its usage is strongly rarefied, it is still worn by some fishermen for whom it is a perfect working accessory, protecting against the sun and the rain thanks to its wide edges indeformable by the wind. The particular silhouette of this headgear is noticeable by far offshore and helps to identify a Saintoise (traditional boat) from les Saintes islands. The elders of the archipelago also wear it during walks in streets at the sunny hours. The men having looked for bamboos and wood from pond, cut it and sharpen it to making this headgear with their dexterity and their know-how. The main structure is formed by fine slats sharped called \\" pikèt \\", joined around a round central piece of wood in cone point, called \\" the heart \\". These slats are tightened and tied up between them by circles of bamboo, called \\" sèrk \\", then rounded off to be fixed in the extremities between two flat strips of bamboo making the circumference, called \\" sèrk bordaj \\".Salako (Les Saintes's traditional hat) Only a good sun exposure allows the hat to obtain a good roundness. A delicate meshing of fibers of bamboo, in the method of the weaving of the founds of chairs or rocking chairs, called le won, comes on the main structure and forms the head size. At the conclusion of this craft work, the needlewomen come on stage and create the dressing of the salako. Traditionally dressed in white fabric for the side exposed to the sun, to limit the heat of the sun and the sky blue for the shaded side (colors of the holy Virgin Mary). It is since the development of the tourism dressed in madras fabric for the business. The salako does not miss to redo its appearance in the traditional costume of les Saintes islands during the festivities and the representations of the local folklore. Origin The salako is almost identical in shape and construction to the traditional Filipino headgear known as the salakot (which is also the origin of the pith helmet). Cloth-covered versions of this headgear were widely adopted by Spanish troops in the early 18th century as lightweight protection against the sun and rain. This was later copied by French colonial troops in Indochina in the mid-19th century who called it the salacco.Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas, Charleston, South Carolina: 2011, Nabu Press, Vol. I, p. 241. The salacco likely arrived at Les Saintes towards the end of the 19th century, on the head of a French naval officer coming back from South-East Asia.L'Indochine, fleuron asiatique de l'empire colonial français. lib.utexas.edu Salako (Les Saintes's traditional hat) Another hypothesis related by the elders of the archipelago tells that the salako would have made its appearance with the arrival of Indo-Chinese Annameses deported in the penal colonies of les Saintes in 1873, for rebellion to France. Five-year-old condemned persons of hard labor, someone stayed to work in farming on the island of Terre-de- Bas.\\"Le dernier fabricant de salako\\". \\"Destination Guadeloupe\\" N°13.

He performed less consistently than in previous seasons, scoring 424 runs at an average of 30.28, with a highest score of 87, one of three half-centuries. In total, Craig made 42 first-class appearances for the university, scoring 2,879 runs at an average of 39.98, with a highest score 208 not out among his seven centuries. Ultimately, Craig decided to pursue a career in academia rather than cricket. Mike Brearley, who played alongside him in the Cambridge University team, described him as \\"a better scholar and batsman than I was\\". The cricket writer John Arlott included Craig in a list of players he considered had the potential, had they continued with their cricket careers, to have played Test cricket. Despite the end of his professional cricket career, he did appear for Cambridgeshire in a single List A match against Oxfordshire in the 1st round of the 1967 Gillette Cup, scoring 12 runs before being dismissed by David Laitt. Cambridgeshire won the match by four wickets, but Craig didn't feature for the county again.

As well as film screenings, the festival hosted parties and the CFC's annual picnic.\\"Photo gallery: It's been a ‘short’ 2 weeks for the CFC\\". Playback. By Katie Bailey. June 9, 2011 The WSFF held accreditation, and was recognized as a qualifying event for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) short film awards. This means that certain award-winners at the WSFF were eligible to be nominated for the Oscars, Genies, and BAFTAs awards.Hickman, Angela. \\"The Worldwide Short Film Festival gets ready to roll out the red carpet\\" The National Post, Toronto, 11 May 2011 In 2012, the festival received 4,768 submissions from 113 countries, making it the largest short film festival in North America at that time. The festival was described in the Canadian Encyclopedia as \\"a popular and productive meeting place for audiences, filmmakers, buyers and sellers interested in the art and commerce of making movies in short form\\", and this was reflected in the Short Films Big Ideas Symposium, which featured master classes and panel discussions focused on professional development for those involved in the industry. Each year the festival offered a celebrity program, which featured films with actors such as Scott Thompson, Judi Dench, David Duchovny, Michael Fassbender, Max von Sydow, Natalie Portman, Dick Van Dyke, Don Cheadle, Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover, Gérard Depardieu, Stephen Fry, and Anthony Hopkins, among others. The festival also screened films by celebrity directors, including Errol Morris, Spike Jonze, Rachel Weisz, Talmage Cooley, Courteney Cox, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In addition to the annual screenings in June, the festival also ran a monthly screening series called A World of Shorts. The Festival Mascot, Miel, watches over the 2012 launch in Dufferin Grove Park History The Worldwide Short Film Festival was founded in 1994, and operated independently under the direction of Brenda Sherwood until 2000, when the Festival was acquired by the Canadian Film Centre (CFC). The Centre brought some professional expertise to the venture: Wayne Clarkson, the CFC's executive director, who was the former head of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), from 1978 to 1985. Brenda Sherwood was replaced as festival director by Shane Smith (2000-2006). Sherwood continued to serve on the festival advisory committee for 2001 festival season. Since 2001, under the direction of Shane Smith, the CFC-WSFF attendance doubled to over 15,000, and submissions increased to over 4,200. The CFC-WSFF also hosted the largest digital marketplace for short films in North America. Several CFC-WSFF juried short films went on to be nominated for Academy Awards. A few, like Chris Landreth's animated documentary Ryan, won the 2004 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, and the 25th Genie Award for Best Animated Short. Other Oscar winners include Harvie Krumpet by Adam Elliot (2003), Wasp by Andrea Arnold (2004) and The Danish Poet by Torill Kove (2006). IMAX Exhibition From 2004-to-2006, Festival Director Shane Smith, and festival researcher Peter Hasek pursued the idea of curating a 45-minute presentation of large format IMAX 15/70mm short films. This presentation was to have been screened at one of the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto, as part of the CFC-WSFF program. The effort had support from Kodak Canada and the English Animation Department of the National Film Board of Canada. The event was to be promoted with tongue-in-cheek, but in actual fact, as \\"the only presentation at the Worldwide Short Film Festival that actually uses film.\\" With only a dozen-or-so 15/70mm short films in existence, the long-term plan was to create a boutique distribution service and \\"circuit\\" for large format short films; with each festival offering its own pro-rated \\"audience choice\\" cash award system. The goal was to create a reliable source of income for large format short film makers. The debut screening of the 15/70mm large format short film platter was to have been held during the Worldwide Short Film Festival, at one of the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto in June, 2006 followed by a screening for the Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival, at the Science North IMAX Theater in Sudbury, Ontario in September, 2006. thumbPromotional sign for the LF Project: a screening of large format, 15/70mm (IMAX) short films, on display at the 2005 Worldwide Short Film Festival. For references on the Large Format Project and the production of 15/70mm short films, see these on-line archives: Following these two festival screenings, the 15/70mm platter was destined for on-going, for-profit screenings at the Western Fair IMAX Theater in London, Ontario in exchange for their help with the project. The Western Fair IMAX projection room and other facilities were to be used for print traffic co-ordination and revision work needed to assemble a 45-minute presentation of 15/70mm short films. There were tentative plans for screening this ad hoc platter of 15/70mm short films at other IMAX theaters in Canada, and the United States, wherever the local IMAX theater had a strong partnership with their local, mainstream film festival that was similar to the working arrangement and relationship between the Cinéfest group and Science North, in Sudbury, Ontario. This plan fell through over time when: # The Western Fair IMAX Theater in London, Ontario ceased operations in September 2005. # The IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto wanted up to $2000/hour in theater rental fees to prepare and host a 15/70mm short film festival event, making the event unrealistic and unaffordable for CFC- WSFF organizers and patrons. And neither the Famous Players IMAX in downtown Toronto or the Cinesphere IMAX at Ontario Place were able to provide print maintenance and on-site storage for the duration of the project, April–June 2006. (At the time, most film festival entries were submitted on DVD; a reel or platter of large format (IMAX) 70mm 15-perf short films can weigh 100 kilograms or more, and requires the use of a forklift truck to move the platter from shipping dock to storage room to projection room.) # The IMAX corporate office in Santa Monica, California let it be known, throughout the IMAX theater network, that the corporation did not support the idea of a large format, 15/70mm short film circuit for its theaters, and that the corporation's priority (circa 2004-05) was the re-purposing of mainstream Hollywood feature films for use in IMAX theaters. The official IMAX distribution model consists of packaging existing IMAX feature films and selling them at a deep discount, so the WSFF's conventional festival model might have been in competition with their commercial goals. # The loss of the project's principals: WSFF Director Shane Smith left the festival, and festival researcher Peter Hasek was diagnosed with cancer. In the end, it was determined that the scope and human resource requirements of The LF Project was so wide and deep, it would require the formation of a separate, double bottom line non-profit organization in order to fully develop, implement and maintain the goal, set forth by Shane Smith and Peter Hasek, of curating a traveling presentation of IMAX short films that was both manageable and financially sustainable. Shane Smith retired as festival director of the CFC- WSFF after the 2006 festival season, and was replaced by former print traffic coordinator, Eileen Arandiga, who is currently the Director of Partnerships and Events at the Canadian Film Centre. Shane Smith is currently the Toronto Film Festival's Director of Special Projects. In early 2013, the Canadian Film Centre began a re-evaluation of its public activities. As part of this re- evaluation process, the CFC Worldwide Short Film Festival was put on hiatus. Previous award winners Academy Awards Oscars qualifications, nominations and wins Up until the 2012 film festival season, and the 2013 hiatus, the Canadian Film Centre's Worldwide Short Film Festival offered two Academy-accredited awards.

The species is solely known from the Early Eocene sediments exposed in south central British Columbia, Canada adjacent to northeast Washington state in the United States. It is the type species for the extinct monotypic section Rousea. Taxonomy Acer rousei was described from two complete fruit specimens which were recovered from outcrops of the early Eocene, Ypresian Allenby Formation exposed near Princeton, British Columbia and an additional three fruits from the Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The two Allenby Formation specimens were found at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture location UWBM B3389, known as the One Mile Creek locality. Both the Allenby Formation and the unnamed formation outcropping at the McAbee Fossil Beds preserve upland temperate floras that were first interpreted as being Microthermal, although further study has shown them to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the Allenby formation is a mixed conifer-broadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir and spruce. In contrast the McAbee Fossil Beds site is mostly broadleaf pollen with alder and elm dominating, and may represent a successional forest involving multiple volcanic ash eruptions. The species was known only from the McAbee Fossil Beds and Princeton fossil localities when first described. A. rousei is among a number of Acer species described from the Princeton and related sites by Wolfe and Tanai. Both the Acer rousei holotype samara, number UWBM 56256 A,B and the paratype UWBM 54107 A,B are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, part of the University of Washington in Seattle. They are from the Allenby Formation. The paratype UBCB 2401 is in the University of British Columbia collections while the paratypes TMP P83.39.586 A,B and TMP P83.39.585 A,B are in the collections of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta. The last three paratypes are all from the McAbee Fossil Beds. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. rousei in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name rousei is in recognition Glenn Rouse, who supplied Wolfe and Tanai with Eocene fossils of Acer from British Columbia. A. stewarti is the only species assigned to the extinct section Rousea and is designated the type species for the section. Description The samaras of A. rousei have two indistinct flanges medially along the notably inflated nutlet. The overall shape of the nutlet is circular to elliptic with the average length of the samara up to and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a notably high attachment angle of 80° to 90°. While very similar in morphology to species in the modern section Palmata, A. rousei differs in the presence of the flanges on the nutlet and circular to elliptic outline of the nutlet. The wing venation of A. rousei is similar to the modern species A. spicatum and its closely related species. The similarities indicate A. rousei as a possible ancestor to the members of the section Palmata.

Born in Skourtou, Aetolia-Acarnania, he entered the Hellenic Air Force Academy in 1959 and graduated first in his class in 1962. He flew F-84, A-7, G-159, T-33, NORATLAS, C-47 and C-130 aircraft and held several staff positions and active commands (345 Bomber Squadron and 112 Fighter Wing). From 1982-1983 he was aide-de-camp to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Andreas Papandreou. He later headed the Air Support Command, the Hellenic Tactical Air Force Command and finally became Chief of the Hellenic Air Force General Staff on 17 December 1993. He held the post until 16 February 1996, when he was appointed to the position of Chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff, a position he held until 15 February 1999. He is married and has two daughters. Tzoganis was one of the pilots who on 21 July 1974 had been ordered to fly to Souda, in order to airlift a Greek Commando battalion to Cyprus (Operation Niki). According to orders, all aircraft had to depart before midnight so that darkness would provide enough cover for their return flight. At around 24:00, Tzoganis' aircraft was ready to depart when the control tower announced the termination of all take offs. Strictly adhering to orders, Tzoganis turned back and shut down his engines.

Although the complete document is classified and 40 pages long, this 19 page summary was released in July 2011 and explores the strategic context of cyberspace before describing five “strategic initiatives” to set a strategic approach for DoDʼs cyber mission.U.S. Department of Defense, \\"Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace\\", July 2011 Accessed September 28th, 2011  Strategic Context  The strategy for operating in cyberspace first outlines DoD strengths, including rapid communication and information sharing capabilities as well as knowledge in the global information and communications technology sector, including cybersecurity expertise. These are considered “strategic advantages in cyberspace.” Additional emphasis is placed on furthering U.S. international cyberspace cooperation through international engagement, collective self-defense, and the establishment of international cyberspace norms.  Cyber Threats  The DoD begins discussion of current cyber threats by focusing on threats to DoD daily operations, with a progressively expanding scope to encompass broader national security concerns. The DoD is aware of the potential for adversaries to use small scale-technology, such as widely available hacking tools, to cause a disproportionate impact and pose a significant threat to U.S. national security. The DoD is concerned with external threat actors, insider threats, supply chain vulnerabilities, and threats to the DoDʼs operational ability. Additionally, the document mentions the DoDʼs need to address “the concerted efforts of both state and non-state actors to gain unauthorized access to its networks and systems.” The DoD strategy cites the rapidly evolving threat landscape as a complex and vital challenge for national and economic security.  Strategic Initiatives  In light of the risks and opportunities inherent in DoD and U.S. Government use of cyberspace, this strategy presents five strategic initiatives as a roadmap to \\"operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.\\" According to the DoD, pursuit of this strategy will see the DoD capitalize on the opportunities of cyberspace, defend against intrusions and malicious activity, strengthen cybersecurity, and develop robust cyberspace capabilities and partnerships.  Strategic Initiative 1  \\"Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace’s potential.\\" :According to the DoD, this consideration allows them \\"to organize train and equip for cyberspace as we do in air, land, maritime, and space to support national security interests.” Consequently they established the U.S. Cyber Command under the U.S. Strategic Command to coordinate cyber activities of the Army, the U.S. fleet cyber command/U.S. 10th fleet, the 24th air force, USMC cyber command, and USCG cyber command. U.S. Cyber Command is collocated with the National Security Agency, with the head of the NSA also serving as the commander of Cybercom. This serves to coordinate training for operations in a \\"degraded\\" environment, including the use of red teams in war games, operating with presumption of a security breach, and development of secure networks for redundancy purposes.  Strategic Initiative 2  \\"Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems.\\" :This includes enhancing best practices and “cyber hygiene,\\" featuring updated software and better configuration management. The DoD will take steps to strengthen workforce communications, accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities to mitigate insider threats. The DoD will also focus on maintaining an active cyber defense to prevent intrusions. In addition to these reactionary concepts, the DoD will develop new defense operating concepts and computing architectures including mobile media and secure cloud computing to embrace evolutionary and rapid change.  Strategic Initiative 3  \\"Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cybersecurity strategy.\\" :Many critical functions of DoD rely on commercial assets such as Internet Service Providers and global supply chains, constituting a vulnerability that DoD and DHS will work together to mitigate. The formalized structure of DOD and DHS understanding sets limits to DoD and DHS policy. Their joint planning will increase effectiveness of cyber needs while respecting privacy and civil liberties and will conserve budget resources. :The DoD also maintains a partnership with the Defense Industrial Base to protect sensitive information. The DoD launched the Defense Industrial Base Cyber Security and Information Assurance program in 2007. :The DoD is also establishing pilot public-private partnership to enhance information sharing. They will continue to work with interagency partners towards a collaborative national effort to develop solutions to increase cybersecurity. A Whole-of-government approach will lead DoD to continue to support interagency cooperation with DHS to analyze and mitigate supply chain threats to government and private sector technology.  Strategic Initiative 4  \\"Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cybersecurity.\\" :In support of the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace, the DoD will seek “robust” relationships to develop international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities for self-defense and collective deterrence. The DoD will assist US efforts to help develop international cyberspace norms and principles, dissuade and deter malicious actors, reserve the right to defend vital national assets as necessary and appropriate. The DoD will also advance cooperation with allies to defend allied interests in cyberspace, work to develop shared warning capabilities, build capacity, conduct joint training, share best practices and develop burden sharing arrangements.  Strategic Initiative 5  \\"Leverage the nation’s ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation.\\" :The DoD intends to \\"catalyze US scientific, academic, and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DoD objectives.” The DoD will foster rapid innovation and invest in people, technology and R&D; to create and sustain cyber capabilities vital to national security. :The DoD outlines 5 principles for the acquisition of information technology: :# Speed is a critical priority. :# Incremental development and testing. :# Sacrifice/defer customization for speedy incremental improvement. :# Adopt differing levels of oversight based on prioritization of critical systems. :# Improved security measures for hardware and software. :The DoD will also promote opportunities for small and medium businesses, work with entrepreneurs in technology innovation hubs to develop concepts quickly. Targeted investments and joint ventures will enable the DoD to foster the development of impactful and innovative technologies. :The DoD also developed the National Cyber Range to allow rapid creation of models of networks intended to enable the military to address needs by simulating and testing new technologies and capabilities. :Development and retention of cyber workforce is central to strategic success outlined in this strategy. Consequently, the DoD will work to streamline hiring for their cyber workforce, enable crossflow of professionals between public and private sectors. As part of this plan, the DoD will also endeavor to develop reserve and national guard cyber capabilities, as well as continue educating their cyber workforce.  Media Reception  Xinhua News Agency cited the opinion of Li Shuisheng, a research fellow with the top military science academy of the People's Liberation Army, alleging the document is \\"fundamentally an attempt of the US to maintain its unparalleled global military superiority.China Daily USA, \\"US cyber strategy dangerous: Chinese experts\\", June 2011 \\"\\" Accessed 11-10-2011\\" Li noted that the strategy \\"clearly aims at sovereign nations in retaliating to cyber attacks,\\" which could lead to a mistake in attribution that may provoke war. Furthermore, the president of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Fang Binxing, alleged that the United States is \\"more often on the offensive not the defensive side of cyber warfare, \\" and consequently can \\"fulfill its political and military purposes, including interference in domestic affairs of other countries and military intrusion, by making up technological effects on the Web.\\" Essentially, Chinese media reporting considers the 2011 Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace clearly stated ambitions for enhancing U.S. hegemony. The day after the DoD strategy document was published, The Voice of Russia published an article citing a recent admission that the Pentagon was successfully hacked in March 2011. The author suggested \\"the Pentagon admission could be just a strategic solution to gain support for its new program of cyber defense.\\"Gladkov, Vladimir, \\"Pentagon claims its vital data was stolen by foreign hackers\\", The Voice of Russia, July 16, 2011 \\"\\" Accessed 11-20-2011 The article states that the strategy received \\"a serious amount of criticism,\\" and concludes by stating that in light of the recent announcement of attacks in March, \\"the scared public should be much more supportive to the controversial strategy.\\"Gladkov Vladimir, \\"Pentagon claims its vital data was stolen by foreign hackers\\", The Voice of Russia, July 16, 2011 \\"\\" Accessed 11-20-2011 CRN News.com cited the opinions of several American cyber security experts who believe the DoD strategy is \\"too vague, lacks enforcement and likely won't warrant an immediate uptick of future business.\\" Furthermore, security experts cite DoD plans to recruit experts from the private sector as a risk for weakening public technological development. At best, the experts observed the document \\"represented a collective growing the issue\\" and could be \\"a public affirmation from the government about activities and plans already in progress.\\"Hoffman, Stephanie, \\"Partners wary of DoD Cyber Security Plan\\", CRN News.com, 07-21-2011 \\"\\" Accessed 12-1-2011 CRN News.com Australia covered the strategy release, focusing on the DoD's consideration of cyberspace as the fifth warfighting domain.

Formed east of Southern Luzon on September 27, 1881. The typhoon killed about 3,000 people in northern Vietnam, and 20,000 people in the Philippines, making it the deadliest typhoon to hit the country. Meteorological history While the storm's category and strength is uncertain (like many disasters prior to the 20th century), records show that the storm developed near the Philippines in late September and by the time it hit Luzon (Philippine island) on September 30, it was already strong enough to cause casualties and disrupt society. Once it was in the South China Sea, its power increased again as it entered into the Gulf of Tonkin, avoiding anymore land before it hit the gulf's coast. The Gulf of Tonkin is a route sometimes taken by typhoons originating near the Philippines as they travel westward in the prevailing tropical easterlies.HurricaneScience.org. Retrieved 2011-12-01. In 1881 Haiphong Typhoon traveled this route after it originated near the Spanish East Indies. Impacts The city of Haiphong lies about 10 miles from the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin and also on the Red River in a low elevation area (delta), connected to an access channel. By the time the typhoon landed in 1881, the town was still a young port established by the French in 1874. Haiphong, being a low-lying port town, was devastated both physically and economically. Its geography only worsened the damage. With the high waves and winds, rice fields were flooded, buildings were decimated (and, as a result, people either were drowned or left stranded), trees were ripped up, etc. By the time the typhoon passed, most of the town was wiped out. Then, due to the inability to operate as a port town, Haiphong's economy also took impact. The storm killed an estimated 20,000 people in the Philippines, making it the deadliest storm in the history of the country. The typhoon killed about 3,000 people in Haiphong, Vietnam. There were erroneous reports that the typhoon was the third-deadliest tropical cyclone on record with a death toll of 300,000, but this was likely due to mixing the death toll with the damage total, as the city only had a population of 18,480 in 1897.Terry et al, 2012  Aftermath  The typhoon of 1881 is not a common occurrence because its path around Hainan is what made it so strong by the time it hit Haiphong. This has not happened again since 1881, but analyses predict that it will happen again. The Vietnamese government has also taken action in case of another severe typhoon hitting the area. Haiphong now has a flood defense system including dykes/levees (though not all of them are firm), a flood warning service provided by Vietnam's Meteorological Service, and evacuation plans. However, Haiphong still serves as a port (and a major one today), so any large storms will harm the economy.

She had previously been the mistress of Hyppolite's successor, Tirésias Simon Sam, and was granted immunity by him after the death of Florvil Hyppolite. Life Victoire Jean- Baptiste was a poor illiterate from the countryside outside Cap-Haïtien. In 1886, she was temporarily the mistress of Tirésias Simon Sam. After this, she was a servant to Geline Hyppolite, spouse of Florvil Hyppolite, and the lover of their son, Chéry Hyppolite. When Florvil Hyppolite became president in 1889, Victoire Jean-Baptiste was moved to the presidential palace in Port-au- Prince, and after the death of Chery in 1893, she functioned openly as the First Lady of Haiti in official ceremonies. She had a great influence in the affairs of state. The president stated that her will in political matters should be respected: she played a great role in the appointment of offices and was regularly given large sums from the state to her private projects, such as a sugar plantation. In 1894, her support made Tirésias Simon Sam minister of war. At the death of Florvil Hyppolite in 1896, she sought refuge at the French embassy. The successor of Hippolyte, however, was Tirésias Simon Sam, who had promised Hyppolite to treat her well because of her service to the state. She settled in Cap-Haïtien with Edward Jerome from Martinique and lived on her fortune. She was given a very bad name in the history of Haiti. She shared with President Hyppolite the practice of Haitian Vodou and their common origin in the North of Haiti. During Hyppolite's presidency she became the owner of two properties in the North: Bayeux and Pétro and a few houses in Cap-Haïtien.

She was the mistress and political advisor of president Alexandre Sabès Pétion and president Jean- Pierre Boyer and exerted a significant influence over the affairs of state during their presidencies, for a period of 36 years (1807–1843). She was called \\"The President of two Presidents\\" and regarded to have been the most politically powerful woman in the history of Haiti before the introduction of women’s suffrage in 1950. Biography Marie-Madeleine Lachenais was the daughter of Marie Thérèse Fabre and the French colonel de Lachenais. She had a relationship with Alexandre Petion, with whom she had two daughters, Cecile and Hersilie. In 1807, Alexandre Petion became president, and she acted as his adviser. Petion appointed Jean-Pierre Boyer as his successor with her support. After the instalment of Jean-Pierre Boyer in 1818, she functioned as mistress and political adviser to Boyer as well and had a daughter, Azema, with him. Her will affected the acts passed in parliament between 1818 and 1840. In 1838, she persuaded Boyer to remain as president when he contemplated to step down. She also revealed and prevented a planned coup, in which Faustin Soulouque was involved. After the deposition of Boyer in 1843, Lachenais and her daughters, referred to as Boyers family, were escorted to a ship to follow Boyer in his exile to Jamaica. She and her daughters lived on a pension from Haiti, which were officially only granted to her daughter Cecile. Boyer is reported to have married her, or to have had plans to marry her, shortly before her death. She died shortly after her arrival in Jamaica.

Mark Wahlberg stars as a police officer turned private investigator and Russell Crowe as the mayor of New York City who hires the private detective to investigate his wife. This is Hughes' first solo feature film directing effort; in previous productions he collaborated with his twin brother Albert. Under a partnership between Emmett/Furla Films and Regency Enterprises, Hughes began production in 2011 in New York City and Louisiana. The film was released in theaters on , 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed just $34 million against its $35-56 million production budget.  Plot  NYPD police officer Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who was believed to have raped and murdered 16-year-old Yesenia Barea but \\"walked\\" on a technicality. Chief Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) goes to Mayor of New York City Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) with a witness and evidence incriminating Taggart, but Hostetler buries the evidence. A judge clears Taggart as having shot Tavarez in self-defense. In a private meeting with Taggart, the mayor calls him \\"a hero\\", but still forces him to leave the police department. Seven years later, Taggart is living with his girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez), an aspiring actress. His private detective business is on the verge of bankruptcy when Mayor Hostetler hires him to investigate his wife, Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whom he suspects is having an affair. With his assistant Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal), Taggart learns that Cathleen is visiting Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), campaign manager of Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, At a fundraiser for Hostetler's campaign, Cathleen reveals to Taggart that she knows he has been following her and advises him not to trust her husband. Taggart gives the mayor photos of Cathleen meeting with Andrews. At the debut screening of Natalie's film, she reveals that her real name is Natalia Barea and that Yesenia was her sister. Taggart is shocked at Natalie's sex scene and strongly disapproves. Consumed with guilt over working for Hostetler, Taggart drinks excessively and argues with Natalie, and she breaks off the relationship. Taggart gets drunk, brawling with strangers in the street. He receives a phone call from Katy and rushes to a crime scene to learn that Andrews has been found murdered. Taggart tells Chief Fairbanks of his work for the mayor. They learn that Valliant was in Andrews' apartment. Valliant reveals that Andrews was scheduled to meet Todd Lancaster (James Ransone), the son of Hostetler's wealthy benefactor, contractor Sam Lancaster (Griffin Dunne). A furious Cathleen tells Taggart that Andrews was a close friend, not her lover, and had promised her information about Hostetler's plans for the Bolton Village Housing Project, expected to enrich both Sam Lancaster and the mayor. Hostetler wanted to discover Cathleen's source, so he manipulated Taggart into tracking her. Taggart decides to investigate Mayor Hostetler for corruption. He goes to Lancaster's construction business and finds workers destroying documents. Stealing some, he discovers that Bolton Village has been sold to build high-rise office buildings, rather than a new housing development, leaving hundreds homeless while Hostetler and Lancaster profit. Taggart is pursued in a car chase by Hostetler's men, who run him off the road and take back the documents. Taggart visits Todd Lancaster, who says he had intended to give Andrews a copy of the demolition contract as evidence against Hostetler on the night Andrews was murdered, and gives Taggart the contract. Taggart confronts Mayor Hostetler, who is unfazed, and reveals a video showing Taggart murdering Tavarez in cold blood. Taggart records their conversation of the mayor admitting to his own corrupt dealings. Despite the risk of further prosecution for Taverez's murder, Taggart turns the recording over to Fairbanks. While Hostetler is at home celebrating a successful debate, Fairbanks arrives to arrest him, and tells the mayor that he was having an affair with Cathleen. In the film's final scene, Taggart meets Fairbanks at a bar, and they toast to Valliant, who has won the election. Katy comes in to say goodbye before the two men leave the bar.  Cast   Production  Broken City was directed by Allen Hughes and written by Brian Tucker. In May 2008, Mandate Pictures bought Tucker's unsolicited screenplay intending to hire a director and cast to film later in the year. In the following July, Mandate entered a deal with the production company Mr. Mudd to jointly produce one film per year, the first being Broken City. The companies aimed to hire the cast and crew by late 2008. Production did not commence as planned, and the project remained in an incomplete state of development. It became part of the film industry's 2008 black list of \\"best, albeit unproduced, screenplays.\\" In June 2011, Emmett/Furla Films began development of Broken City with an anticipated budget of . Allen Hughes was attached to direct. By the following October, Regency Enterprises joined the project to co-finance with Emmett/Furla Films. Variety reported that Regency founder Arnon Milchan wanted to produce \\"edgier fare\\" like it previously did with the 1990s films Heat and L.A. Confidential. This would be Hughes' first feature film directing effort without his twin brother Albert. (Allen also directed the TV movie Knights of the South Bronx (2005) and a few episodes of the American version of the TV series Touching Evil.) Hughes said about working on his own, \\"The issue is learning that you're going to be in a room sometimes, and there's going to be eight guys assaulting you, creatively. Back in the day, when it was me and him, they could have had 15 people in the room, and they were all getting laid out.\\" He met Tucker in 2010 at the Palm restaurant in West Hollywood, where he learned about the screenwriter's Broken City. With a production budget of , shooting began in New York City in November 2011. Filming also took place in the Carrollton neighborhood of New Orleans and in other parts of Louisiana.  Release  Broken City was released in in the United States and Canada on , 2013. The film competed with fellow openers Mama and The Last Stand, as well as Silver Linings Playbook in its widening release. The Los Angeles Times said the film drew \\"the most interest from older audiences\\". Prior to Broken Citys release, Variety reported that the film was estimated to have \\"a low to mid- teens opening\\" weekend. It grossed on Friday through Sunday, ranking fifth. It grossed through the holiday (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day) on Monday. Broken City grossed in the United States and Canada.  Home media  Broken City was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 30, 2013.  Critical reception  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 28% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 4.66/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Broken City's thinly sketched, formulaic script offers meager rewards for all but the least demanding noir aficionados.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Emily Helwig wrote for The Hollywood Reporter, critics \\"have been less than thrilled\\" with Broken City. \\"While many praise the talented cast and others enjoyed the cinematography, some critics add that Brian Tucker's screenplay might have been the problem and that it may have been a better story told as a period piece.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune praises the cinematography of Ben Seresin, describing it as having an \\"autumnal glow\\", but criticizes the \\"coincidence and improbability\\" of the script, which lets down the able cast. Richard Roeper gave it 3 out of 4 stars, criticizing the script but saying, \\"It's pretty trashy and sometimes stupid. But there was never a moment when I wasn't entertained on one level or another.\\"  See also  *List of films featuring fictional films  References   External links  * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 crime drama films Category:2013 crime thriller films Category:2010s political thriller films Category:2013 thriller drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American action films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American detective films Category:American films Category:American political thriller films Category:American thriller drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about elections Category:Films directed by the Hughes brothers Category:Films produced by Mark Wahlberg Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Louisiana Category:Films shot in New York City Category:MoviePass Films films Category:Mr. Mudd films Category:Films scored by Atticus Ross Category:2013 drama films ","title":"Broken City"},{"id":"33927491","text":"250px Church of St Andrew is a Grade I listed church in Langford, Bedfordshire, England.

It became a listed building on 31 October 1966. Design The nave in St Leonards The Sanctuary in St Leonards The restored snake pews St Leonard's is named for Leonard of Noblac and dates to the early 12th century but the present structure is predominantly 13th century, with 14th, 15th and 16th century additions. The base of the tower, including the tower arch, is 12th century Norman, with the remainder rebuilt in the 15th century. The church was considerably reworked in the mid and late 19th century when the elaborate wooden interior was added. The church is built mainly of brown cobblestones with limestone dressings, with some later working in red brick and in coursed limestone. The south porch was built in 1952 to a design by Professor Richardson and is timber framed with red brick infill and a gabled tiled roof. It was added in 1952 by Mrs Dorothy Shuttleworth in memory of her son, Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth (1909-1940). Today the church is best known for the richly ornate wooden carvings with which it was \\"beautified\\" by the Rt. Hon. Robert Henley-Ongley, 3rd Baron Ongley of Old Warden in the mid 19th century. From widely differing periods and mostly from Belgium, France and Italy, the carvings are said to include a number of panels removed from the private chapel of Anne of Cleves; these can be identified by the initials AC surmounted by a crown. A number of wooden panels including 15 showing Biblical scenes were stolen from the church in 1997 and were never recovered. It is intended to replace them with contemporary carvings of a similar nature.A Guide to the Parish Church of St Leonard Old Warden, Bedfordshire, (Anon.), (ND) pg 1 A noted feature of the church is the medieval stained glass of the 14th century in the north wall which was originally in nearby Wardon Abbey and which shows the figure of St Margaret on the right holding a rope while on the left is a figure of an Abbot of Wardon Abbey in the white habit of a Cistercian. Further along the north wall in the chancel is a marble tablet by Goscombe John dedicated in memory of Frank Shuttleworth (1845-1913) by his widow, Mrs Dorothy Shuttleworth. Some of the inscription was erased later to record that their only son Pilot Officer Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth RAFVR was killed in a flying accident during World War II while serving in the RAF. The lectern bears the eagle and motto of the Royal Air Force and was given by Mrs Shuttleworth again in memory of her son. The carved wooden pulpit shows Jesus with children and the Woman of Samaria and is probably 18th century Flemish. It was purchased by Frank Shuttleworth from an antique shop in Edinburgh. Originally it had carvings of the signs of the Four Evangelists on the four pilasters but these were stolen in 1997.Guide, pg 5 The wooden panels on the front of the altar are late 19th century. The serpents on the front pew are of particular note. One was damaged during the burglary of 1997 and was repaired by local craftsmen while the second was stolen and subsequently replaced. The large box pew at the top of the nave opposite the pulpit was the Shuttleworth Family pew and contains a fine carving of the Women preparing the body of Christ. Above this is a large and ornate baroque carving representing Faith, erected by her sister in memory of Caroline Jane Shuttleworth, who died in 1899.Guide, pg 11 At the west end of the nave is a life-size monument by Peter Scheemakers and Laurent Delvaux to Sir Samuel Ongley (1647–1726), a Member of Parliament, Director of the East India Company and the first Deputy Governor of the South Sea Company. Only one putto remains, the other having been stolen in the burglary of 1997. The octagonal wooden tiles set in the two pillars were placed there at the time of the restoration of the church during the reign of Mary I of England of Queen Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII, and whose initial they bear. The gallery along the south wall of the nave was added in 1841 by Lord Ongley. The blank-arched panels are English and are believed to be Elizabethan or Jacobean. The baptismal font is 14th century and is surmounted by a mid-19th century Gothic Revival canopy. Richard Shuttleworth Chapel The Richard Shuttleworth Memorial Chapel In 2008, after changes in the status of the Shuttleworth Chapel in Old Warden Park, St Leonard's church received a number of items from the chapel, including two flags, two lances with regimental pennants, linen and lace altar cloths, a wooden cross and candlesticks. With these items also came the oval plaque with the Shuttleworth family crest and RAF wings dedicated to Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth (1909-1940), who was killed in a flying accident while on active service during World War II and who is buried in the churchyard. This plaque has been placed in the Chapel, in the south nave part of the church.Guide, pg 11 The window above the altar in the Richard Shuttleworth Chapel was presented by his father Frank Shuttleworth to commemorate the Coronation of Edward VII. The date in the window, however, is wrong as the window was completed before the Coronation which had to be postponed because of the illness of the King.Guide, pg 12 The bells The church has six bells with the oldest (No 5) being more than 400 years old. No 3 bell was originally cast in 1653 by the bell-founder Miles Graye but was recast in 1976. The tenor bell was recast in 1840 by Thomas Mears of London. Nos. 1 and 2 bells were cast by Taylor of Loughborough and were added in 1897 by Colonel Frank Shuttleworth to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.Guide, pg 4 Notable burials The Shuttleworth Family grave in the churchyard * Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey (1872–1949), Royal Navy officer and courtier * Sir Ralph Endersby Harwood (1883–1951), Financial Secretary to George V, Edward VIII and George VI * Robert 'Bob' Lang (1840-1908), Vicar of St Leonard's 1892-1902 and who played first-class cricket from 1860 to 1862 for Cambridge University. * Robert Henley-Ongley, 1st Baron Ongley (c.1721–1785), British politician * Sir Samuel Ongley (1647–1726), English politician * Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth (1909-1940), racing driver and aviator In the north-east corner of the churchyard stands the Ongley Family mausoleum, built in 1790 and containing 42 vaults, only 10 of which were used.

Career Corry grew up in Castleknock, Dublin, and attended Belvedere College. Corry has represented his country at various underage levels as well as being selected for the Republic of Ireland U-23 squad. The talented midfielder combined a footballing career with a degree in Commerce during his 3 years at University College Dublin. Corry was a member of the successful Belvedere side alongside the likes of Matt Doherty and Jake Carroll who won the FAI Under-17 Cup in 2009 by beating Kilmallock United. The young Midfielder has been on the books of University College Dublin since 2009 having joined the club from Belvedere. Corry was on trial with Burnley for two-weeks in July 2009 but chose to continue his education at Belfield, as he felt he was not ready for a move to another football club at that moment in time. Having signed for UCD in the summer of 2009, Corry made an instant impact at the club making 10 appearances and scoring 3 goals as the then 18-year-old helped UCD to the 2009 League of Ireland First Division title and promotion to the Premier Division. Corry re-signed for UCD for the 2012 season, and overall has made 105 appearances for the club, including 10 goals. Corry scored his first goal of the 2012 season away to Shelbourne, his 25-yard screamer snatching a win for UCD. He was then called up to the Republic of Ireland U-21 side for the 2013 UEFA Euro U-21 Championship qualifier against Turkey U-21, however he did not make an appearance for the national side. His successful 2012 season saw Corry being watch by many English sides, and he was finally signed up by newly promoted Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in England. Corry had finally felt that now was the right time for a big move in hope of a successful footballing career following his successful graduation with a BComm degree from UCD.

Biography  Henri de Valois was born the bastard son of Henri II of France and his mistress Janet Stewart, who was an illegitimate daughter of James IV of Scotland and served as governess to the young Mary, Queen of Scots. Being the most highly favored natural son of the King, Henri was legitimized and made Duke of Angoulême. He would later serve as Abbot of La Chaise-Dieu, Grand Prior of France and Admiral of the Levantine Sea, further ruling as Governor of Provence from 1579 until his death in 1586. In 1570, the supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was exiled in England, selected Henri as a potential leader of a French military force to aid them in their civil war against the supporters James VI of Scotland. They thought that Henri's Scottish and French royal ancestry would gain him respect in Scotland and England. Although the Queen's supporters put the idea to John Lesley, Queen Mary's ambassador in France, French soldiers and Henri were not sent to Scotland. Tapestry detailing the Siege of La Rochelle (1572-1573) Henri d'Angoulême took a major role in the two extended military battle against Huguenot strongholds during the height of the French Wars of Religion, engaging in the massive Siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573), organized by the Duke of Anjou, future Henry III of France, and leading the five-year Siege of Ménerbes (1573–1578), fought at a citadel in the Luberon foothills cherished by Pope Pius V.

Very little is known of him, including his origins and the nature of his kingdom, although his descendants are well attested in the Irish annals. Speculative connections between these historical figures and characters from the Norse sagas have also been made. Life The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland record of Amlaib Conung that in 871 he: > went from Erin to Lochlann to wage war on the Lochlanns, and to aid his > father Goffridh, for the Lochlanns had made war against him, his father > having come for him.Annals of Ireland (1860), p. 195.Ó Corráin (1998), p. > 34. Frustratingly, the text continues: > Since it would be lengthy to tell the cause of their war, and since it has > so little relevance to us, although we have knowledge of it, we forego > writing it, for our task is to write about whatever concerns Ireland, and > not even all of that; for the Irish suffer evils not only from the > Norwegians, but they also suffer many evils from themselves.Fragmentary > Annals of Ireland FA 400 These annals also note that in 849: > the sixth year of the reign of Máel Sechlainn, Amlaib Conung, son of the > king of Lochlann, came to Ireland, and he brought with him a proclamation of > many tributes and taxes from his father, and he departed suddenly. Then his > younger brother Imar came after him to levy the same tribute.Fragmentary > Annals of Ireland FA239. \\"Máel Sechlainn\\" is Máel Sechnaill mac Maíl > Ruanaid. The translator for this text uses \\"Norway\\" although the original > text is \\"Lochlann\\" or variants. This source is then clear that Amlaib is the son of Gofraid, king of Lochlann, although the location of \\"Lochlann\\" is the subject of some dispute.See Etchingham (2007) This word is often translated as \\"Norway\\" although Ó Corráin (1998) argues that Lochlann \\"is Viking Scotland and probably includes Man\\" at this time and suggests an early date for an organised Kingdom of the Isles.Ó Corráin (1998), pp. 6, 10. The Fragmentary Annals record little else about Gofraid's life but report of 873: > Ég righ Lochlainne .i. Gothfraid do tedmaimm grána opond. Sic quod placuit > Deo. (The death of the king of Lochlann i.e. Gothfraid of a sudden and > horrible fit. So it pleased God.)Ó Corráin (1998), p. 36. However, according to Downham (2007) \\"none of these details can be relied upon\\"Downham (2007), p. 253. as \\"there is no contemporary evidence to support the statement that [Amlaib's] father was called Gofraid\\",Downham (2007), p. 240. the Fragmentary Annals having been compiled at an uncertain date, possibly as early as the 11th century. Neither is the dating of the Annals definitive. Nonetheless, Ó Corráin (1998) argues of 873 that \\"this is no chronological impossibility: his sons first appeared in Ireland 25 years before, very likely in their twenties or younger, and we may infer from this that he may have been in his sixties when he died.\\"Ó Corráin (1998), p. 37. He also states that \\"it is likely that the father of Amlaíb (Óláfr) and Ímar (Ívarr) is Gothfraidh (Guðrøðr) and that he is a historical person and dynastic ancestor.\\"Ó Corráin (1998), p. 3. Predecessors The Fragmentary Annals note of a date c. 871–872 that \\"In this year, i.e. the tenth year of the reign of Áed Findliath, Imar son of Gothfraid son of Ragnall son of Gothfraid Conung son of Gofraid and the son of the man who left Ireland, i.e. Amlaib, plundered from west to east, and from south to north.\\"Fragmentary Annals of Ireland FA 401 This suggests an ancestry for Gofraid but according to Ó Corráin this reference to \\"his genealogical ascent is a construct without historical value\\" and attempts to link the Kings of Lochlann with historical figures in Norway have not proven to be satisfactory.Ó Corráin (1979), pp. 296–97.Ó Corráin (1998), p. 4. Alfred Smyth identifies Amlaib as Olaf Geirstad-Alf of Vestfold, which would make Gofraid identical to Gudrød the Hunter, grandfather of Harald Fairhair.Smyth (1989), pp. 159–60. However Ó Corráin maintains that there is \\"no good historical or linguistic evidence to link Lothlend/Laithlind with Norway, and none to link the dynasty of Dublin to the shadowy history of the Ynglings of Vestfold.\\"Ó Corráin (1998), p. 10. Descendants Uí Ímair dynasts. \\"Halfdan\\" is Halfdan Ragnarsson, presumed brother of Ivar the Boneless whose relationship with Ímar son of Gofraid is \\"doubtful\\".Ó Corráin (1979),p. 323 In addition to Amlaib Conung, Gofraid had at least two other children, Amlaib's brothers Ímar, the eponymous founder of the Uí Ímair, and Óisle. The Annals of Ulster also note that there was a king of \\"Laithlinne\\" whose heir, Thórir, brought an army to Ireland in 848 and who died there in battle.Ó Corráin (1998), p. 24. Although there is no specific suggestion that this king was Gofraid this is only the year before the Fragmentary Annals' first record of Amlaib as the king's son. According to the Fragmentary Annals c. 867: > There was an encounter between Óisle, son of the king of Norway, and Amlaib, > his brother. The king had three sons: Amlaib, Imar, and Óisle. Óisle was the > least of them in age, but he was the greatest in valor, for he outshone the > Irish in casting javelins and in strength with spears. He outshone the > Norwegians in strength with swords and in shooting arrows. His brothers > loathed him greatly, and Amlaib the most; the causes of the hatred are not > told because of their length. The two brothers, Amlaib and Imar, went to > consult about the matter of the young lad Óisle; although they had hidden > reasons for killing him, they did not bring these up, but instead they > brought up other causes for which they ought to kill him; and afterwards > they decided to kill him.Fragmentary Annals of Ireland FA 347 When Óisle visited Amlaib the former said: > 'Brother, if your wife, i.e. the daughter of Cináed, does not love you, why > not give her to me, and whatever you have lost by her, I shall give to you.' > When Amlaib heard that, he was seized with great jealousy, and he drew his > sword, and struck it into the head of Óisle, his brother, so that he killed > him. After that all rose up to fight each other (i.e. the followers of the > king, Amlaib, and the followers of the brother who had been killed there); > then there were trumpets and battle-cries on both sides. In 870 Dumbarton was besieged by Amlaib Conung and Ímar, \\"the two kings of the Northmen\\", who \\"returned to Dublin from Britain\\" the following year with numerous captives.Woolf (2007), p. 109. Gofraid may have been succeeded briefly by Ímar who also died in 873. His death is recorded in the Annals of Ulster: Imhar rex Nordmannorum totius Hibernię & Brittanie uitam finiuit (Ímar king of the Norwegian Vikings of the whole of Ireland and Britain ended his life.) Amlaíb died either the following year campaigning in Scotland,Ó Corráin (1998), p. 35. or perhaps prior to 872.Woolf (2007), p. 10. The matter of Gofraid's descendants and antecedents is subject to some ambiguity based on differing interpretations of these siblings and their connections to legendary figures from the Norse sagas. Ímar The descendants of Ímar include his grandson Ragnall ua Ímair, who was a ruler of Northumbria and MannWoolf (2007), pp. 141, 144.

The latter is referred to in late 11th century Icelandic saga material as a son of the powerful Ragnar Lodbrok.

The History Files. Retrieved 18 November 2011. Nor is there any indication in the Irish annals that Ragnar Lodbrok had any Irish connections.Ó Corráin (1979), p. 294. Amlaib Amlaib had two sons, Oistin (d. 875) and Carlus (d. 868). Unlike Ímar, no later descendants are recorded but like his brother, he has also been identified as a saga character — Olaf the White.Crawford (1987), p. 192.

However, Aud does not appear in the Irish sources and there are various problems with the connection. For example, the Landnámabók has Olaf killed in battle in Ireland, but no Irish source refers to the battle and the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba has Amlaib dying in Pictavia at the hands of Causantín mac Cináeda.Woolf (2007), pp. 281–82.

In 1843 he completed a study in the exact sciences and received his PhD from the University of Leiden in 1847 under Gideon Janus Verdam (1802–1866) for the work . After this he became a teacher of physics and mathematics at a gymnasium in Deventer. In 1852 he married Johanna Catharina Justina de Schepper (1827–1906) in Deventer. In 1856 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Since 1866 he was professor of mathematics at Leiden University. Since 1888 he was co-editor of the works of Christiaan Huygens and in 1892 edited the Algebra of Willem Smaasen (1820–1850). He had a large library on mathematics, the history of science and pedagogy, which currently resides at the Leiden University Library.

At age 18, 1943, he enlisted in the United States Army for service in World War II. After returning from the war, Kincaid worked as a cabinetmaker and grocer.  Political career  From 1970 to 1973, he was a member of the Board of Directors of Nicolet Area Technical College, the city council of Crandon, Wisconsin, and a member of the Forest County Board of Supervisors. In 1972, he was elected to his first term in the Wisconsin Legislature, when he was elected to represent the 36th district in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Though originally elected as a Republican, and re-elected twice on the Republican ticket, in the middle of his third term, Kincaid switched parties and became a conservative Democrat. He was disappointed with the way the Republican caucus had handled legislative negotiations over a change to the mining tax. After his party-switch, he was re-elected three more times, including his narrow 1982 victory over fellow-incumbent Earl W. Schmidt, with whom he had been forced into a confrontation due to redistricting. Shortly after the 1982 election, on December 15, 1982, incumbent state senator Clifford Krueger announced he would retire at the end of the year.

Ed. Saul Patai. John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Chapter 10. 403-516, 1990. Sulfenamides have been used extensively in the vulcanization of rubber using sulfur. They are related to the oxidized compounds sulfinamides (RS(O)NR'2) and sulfonamides (RS(O)2NR'2). Preparation Sulfenamides are usually prepared by the reaction of sulfenyl chlorides and amines: :RSCl + R'2NH → RSNR'2 \\\\+ HCl The S-N bond formation generally obeys standard bimolecular nucleophilic substitution rules, with the basic nitrogen centre being the nucleophile. Primary sulfenamide formation as shown above occurs with the reaction of the sulfenyl halide with ammonia. Additionally primary as well as secondary and tertiary amines form sulfenamides through reaction with, thiols, disulfides, and sulfenyl thiocyanates.Drabowicz, J., Kielbasinski, P., Mikoiajczyk, M. (1990). \\"Synthesis of Sulphenyl Halides and Sulphenamides\\". The Chemistry of Sulphenic Acids and their derivatives. Ed. Saul Patai. John Wiley & Sons Ltd.. Chapter 6. 221-292. In one illustrative synthesis, triphenylmethanesulphenyl chloride and butylamine react in benzene at 25 C: :Ph3CSCl + 2BuNH2 → Ph3CSN(H)Bu + BuNH3Cl Many other routes to sulfenamides are known, starting from thiols and disulfides.I V Koval' \\"Synthesis and Application of Sulfenamides\\" Russian Chemical Reviews, 1996, Volume 65, :RSSR + 2R'2NH + Ag+ → RSNR'2 \\\\+ AgSR + R'2NH2+ Captan, a fungicide, is an commercially important sulfenamide. Structure Sulfenamides have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. The S-N bond in sulfenamides is a chiral axis that leads to formation of diastereomeric compounds. The existence of these distinct stereoisomers is due to the formation of a partial double bond between either sulfur or nitrogen’s lone pair and the other atom's antibonding orbitals. Additionally bulky substituent groups and lone pair repulsion can contribute resistance to interconversion. The resulting torsional barriers can be quite large and vary from 12-20 kcal/mol. The interactions are thought to be dependent on the torsional preferences (also known as the gauche effect). The nitrogen atom is usually pyramidal, but cyclic and strongly steric hindered acyclic sulfenamides can display a planar arrangement of bonds around the nitrogen atom. Reactions The S-N bond n sulfenamide are labile in a variety of ways. The sulfur atom tends to be the more electrophilic center of the S-N bond. Nucleophillic attack on sulfur can occur by amines, by thiols, and by alkyl-magnesium halides which leads to either new sulfenamide compounds or back to starting compounds such as sulfides and disulfides respectively. Both the nitrogen and sulfur atoms comprising the S-N bond in sulfenamides have lone pairs of electrons in their outer shells, one and two for nitrogen and sulfur respectively. These lone pairs allow for the possibility of forming either higher order bonds(double, triple) or adding new subsituent groups to the compound For instance the nitrogen in the S-N bond of 2-hydroxysulfenanilides can oxidized to an imine species with sodium dichromate. Sulfenamides react with amino-azaheterocycles to form heterocyclic systems (often used as amino protecting groups in various other synthesis reactions). Chlorocarbonylsulfenyl chloride (ClCOSCl) also readily forms S-N bonds with 2-amino-azaheterocycles, but always of a cyclical nature. A novel variant of the Appel reaction has been noted for sulfenamides. Reaction of o-nitrobenzenesulfenamide with PPh3 and CCl4 leads the formation of o-nitro-N-(triphenylphosphorany1idene)-benzenesulfenamide. In this variant reaction the triphenyl phosphine forms a double bonded linkage with nitrogen in the sulfenamide instead of oxygen as is customary in the Appel reaction. Additionally in the traditional Apple reaction the R-OH bond is cleaved leaving oxygen attached to triphenylphosphine. In this variant the S-N bond is not cleaved. Applications Sulfenamides, e.g. cyclohexylthiophthalimide, are used extensively in the vulcanization of rubber. The sulfenamides are used to accelerate the process via the transient formation of labile S-N bonds. The substituents on the sulfenamides determine the point at which they will become active. Temperature dependent activation of sulfenamide accelerants is useful in the vulcanization process because the temperature at which the rubber polymerizes determines the length of the sulfur chains, and properties such as the elasticity of the final product.

The episode was written by James Wong and directed by Michael Lehmann. This episode is rated TV-MA (LV). In this episode, the reason for Larry's (Denis O'Hare) burns are revealed, while Violet (Taissa Farmiga) learns a shocking truth. Charles S. Dutton guest stars as Detective Granger. Plot Flashing back to 1994, after Larry Harvey's wife, Lorraine, kills herself and their daughters, Constance, Tate, and Addie move into the house with Larry. On Thanksgiving, Tate berates Larry for killing Beau and his naivety with Constance. Tate also resents Constance for this. Tate, high on cocaine and crystal meth, goes to Larry's office and immolates him, before committing the school shooting (\\"Piggy Piggy\\"). Ben visits Vivien in the ward, and apologizes. He tells her he believes her claims that she was raped, and she will be discharged soon. He also tells her that the rapist fathered one of the twins. Detectives tell Constance of Travis' murder, and she confronts Larry, believing he killed Travis out of jealousy. Larry says a ghost killed Travis in the house. Constance says she never loved him. A truant officer informs Ben that Violet has skipped school for sixteen days. Detectives take Constance in for questioning over Travis' death. They mention the district attorney intended to charge her with the murder of her husband Hugo and Moira, but could not find the bodies. Larry enters the house and sees his daughters and wife. He apologizes to Lorraine and swears to get revenge on Constance, but she tells him that he broke their wedding vows, not Constance. Wearing the Rubber Man suit, Tate attacks Ben with chloroform. Ben fights him and pulls off his mask, seeing Tate's face before going unconscious. Tate tries to convince Violet to commit suicide. Violet flees, but is unable to leave the house. Tate shows Violet her decaying corpse; she did not survive a suicide attempt (\\"Piggy Piggy\\"). Tate has also known that he too was a ghost the entire time. Constance learns that Larry has confessed to the murder. She visits him in jail, and he explains he confessed to pay for his sins, but will be able to handle his punishment if Constance will just say she loves him. Constance coldly refuses and leaves. Production The episode was written by co-executive producer James Wong, while being directed by Michael Lehmann. Taissa Farmiga had guessed that Violet was dead early on from hints dropped in earlier scripts, though the staff were not allowed to confirm her suspicions. Though series co-creator Ryan Murphy had planned for Violet to be dead for a long time, he kept this information from the staff, and intentionally wrote the suicide scene in Episode 6, \\"Piggy Piggy\\" to be vague. Murphy only revealed Violet's death to the other writers while they were writing Episode 8, \\"Rubber Man\\". Both Murphy and Farmiga described the scene revealing Violet's death as \\"emotional.\\" Violet's decaying corpse was a prosthetic made from a mold of Farmiga's body. Farmiga had not seen the prosthetic until shooting; Murphy claims that Violet's reaction during the close up of the reveal is Farmiga's response to seeing herself dead for the first time. Murphy sensed audience concerns that the previous two episodes, \\"Rubber Man\\" and \\"Spooky Little Girl\\", were straying from the main characters of the show, moving Vivien away from the house and introducing the character of The Black Dahlia. Thus, Murphy intended this and the remaining episodes to focus more on the Harmon family and the outcome of their experiences in the house. Reception \\"Smoldering Children\\" received critical acclaim; Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, based on 8 reviews. The Star-Ledger James Queally commented on the episode, saying, \\"Every week, I think I have American Horror Story figured out... the show sits down, shuts up, straps in and delivers an effective, character-driven story like \\"Smoldering Children\\".\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff said this about the episode, \\"I could make a number of complaints if pressed, since there were the usual dumb moments, character beats, and lines of dialogue, but... this was awesomely pulpy genre fun.\\" She gave the episode an A grade.

The storm brought floods to several East Asian countries in July 1959\\\\. Billie developed from a tropical disturbance west of Kiribati on July 12\\\\. Situated within favorable conditions, the system quickly reached tropical storm intensity before strengthening further to typhoon status a day after formation. Intensification continued until Billie reached its peak intensity on July 14 east of Taiwan with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Slight weakening occurred before the typhoon made landfall on Zhejiang in China on July 16\\\\. After tracking inland, Billie curved northward and moved over the Yellow Sea before making a final landfall on North Korea on July 17; the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards before dissipating over the Sea of Japan a day later. The rainbands of Billie brought severe flooding to the Philippines and Japan even while the typhoon's center was well removed from those locations. In the Philippines, one person was killed, and the flood damage totaled US$500,000. Floods were particularly destructive in Japan, where they destroyed 603 homes in the western portion of the country. Swaths of crops were inundated by the floodwaters, and 44 people were killed. Extensive flooding occurred in Taiwan and China, and seven deaths occurred in the former. In Busan, South Korea, Billie's effects forced the evacuation of thousands of people through tight corridors from a stadium, causing the indirect deaths of 61 people. Meteorological history Beginning on July 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began dispatching aircraft reconnaissance to investigate an area of thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there were few signs of organization or intensification until July 12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160 km (100 mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie. At 1200 UTC on July 13, the JTWC upgraded Billie further to typhoon status, making Billie the first tropical cyclone to be monitored by the JTWC since its inception earlier in 1959. Now tracking steadily towards the northwest, the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200 UTC the next day with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50 km (30 mi) in diameter. At 0900 UTC on July 15, Billie passed just 30 km (20 mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in Zhejiang with winds estimated at 120 km/h (75 mph). Upon tracking inland on July 16, interaction with China's mountainous terrain disrupted the organization of Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July 17. Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75 km/h (40 mph). Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a polar front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 UTC that day. These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July 18. Impact As Billie tracked to the east of the Philippines, the outer rainbands of the tropical cyclone produced heavy rainfall to the archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, and the main islands of Japan. In the Philippines, the rains triggered floods that led to the death of one person and US$500,000 in damage. About 100 people were displaced on the islands due to the rainfall. The Japanese freighter Bansei Maru was grounded on a reef off of Ishigaki Island due to the rough surf and winds caused by the passing typhoon, necessitating a rescue operation by three United States Navy ships. On the island, 16 homes were destroyed and 49 were heavily damaged. Inundation of crops was prevalent. Flooding from Billie was highly destructive in areas of Japan west of the Chūbu region, destroying 603 homes and inundating 77,288 others. Roughly 325 km2 (125 mi2) of farmland was impacted by the rains. Across Japan, 44 people were killed and 77 were injured. In northern Taiwan, Billie caused widespread flash flooding, displacing thousands of people and resulting in extensive damage. Approximately one-third of Taipei was inundated by floodwaters, and hospital patients were forced to evacuate to Okinawa after a Military Assistance Advisory Group compound was impacted by the heavy rains. Over 10,000 people were rendered homeless in Taipei alone after the city's shanty-type dwellings along with well-built residences were destroyed. In total, the effects of Billie in Taiwan killed seven people. Extensive flooding also occurred in nearby eastern China, inundating rice fields. In order to avoid the storm, thousands of fishermen sought shelter in local harbors. Cleanup and relief operations quickly ensued following the storm's passage. Storms accompanying Billie and its remnants brought heavy rains and strong winds to South Korea, knocking out police telephone lines in Busan. The sudden onslaught of these storms caused a stampede of roughly 70,000 people out of a stadium, resulting in the indirect deaths of 68 people, including 51 children. Around 125 people were injured and 40 were hospitalized after the mass evacuation.

Wards in grey were not contested in 2007. The 2007 Carlisle City Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of Carlisle District Council in Cumbria, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 25 *Conservative 19 *Liberal Democrats 7 *Independent 1 Background Before the election the Conservative party formed the administration on the council with the support of the Liberal Democrats, but Labour were the largest party with 24 seats, compared to 19 Conservatives, 7 Liberal Democrats and 1 independent. A further seat was vacant in Morton, after the Liberal Democrat councillor Ralph Aldersey stood down from the council. 18 seats were being contested with Labour needing to make at least 2 gains to take control of the council. Candidates at the election included an independent Maureen Toole in Belah ward, after her husband Alan Toole, the sitting councillor for the ward, was deselected by the Conservatives. Both the Conservative and Labour parties contested all 18 seats, while the Liberal Democrats had candidates in 6 wards. The British National Party contested seats in Carlisle for the first time, with 6 candidates, and there was also 1 candidate from the English Democrats. Campaign Labour campaigned on a pledge to tackle anti-social behaviour, such as dog fouling and littering, and targeted Morton from the Liberal Democrats and Belah from the Conservatives, where they were hoping the Conservative vote would be split due to the independent candidate. Meanwhile, the Conservatives defended their record in control of the council and targeted the Labour held seats of Belle Vue and Yewdale. The Liberal Democrats defended their seats, while hoping to gain Dalston from the Conservatives and Upperby from Labour. During the campaign the national Conservative leader David Cameron visited Carlisle to support his party in the election, while the Constitutional Affairs Minister Harriet Harman came to support Labour. Election result Only 1 seat changed hands at the election, with Labour gaining Morton from the Liberal Democrats to remain the largest party on the council with 25 seats. Labour also narrowly beat off Conservative challenges in Belle Vue by 31 votes and in Yewdale by only 10 votes. This meant the Conservatives stayed on 19 councillors, the Liberal Democrats dropped to 7, and there continued to be 1 independent. Among those elected was Labour's Abdul Harid in Currock ward, who became the first Asian councillor on Carlisle council, defeating the British National Party who came second in the ward. Overall turnout at the election was 35.45%, up from 34.6% at the 2006 election. Following the election Conservative Mike Mitchelson remained as leader of the council after the Liberal Democrats continued to support him, in return for which Liberal Democrat Peter Farmer joined the council executive. The election for mayor was won by Conservative Liz Mallinson by 26 votes to 25 for Labour's Mary Styth, after one Labour councillor missed the meeting, while Mike Mitchelson was re-elected by 26 votes to 24. All 7 Liberal Democrats backed the Conservative candidates, while the only independent councillor Bill Graham, voted for the Labour candidate for mayor Mary Styth, as she had served on the council for the longest period, and abstained on the vote for council leader.

A purebred dog has the characteristics of the breed to which it belongs, is an offspring of two purebred parents and should be eligible for registry in the purebred association of that breed should it not have any disqualifications such as undesirable color markings. The motto of a responsible breeder of purebred dogs is to \\"Breed to Improve\\", to produce a better dog and quality pet.  History  Animal breeding as an ancient human occupation, can be traced back to domestication and dates back to at least 14 thousand yrs ago. The modern processes of purebred breeding evolved between the late 18th century and the late 20th century, influenced significantly by advancements and increased understanding of genetics and eugenics. The dogs were isolated from the larger gene pool of their species and inbreed to maintain certain characteristics. This led to smaller adult sizes compared to their wild counterparts, less acute sight and hearing, and crowding of the teeth. Smaller brains and shorter heads are also a result of neoteny as they carry juvenile characteristics into adulthood. Purebred dogs also tend to mature earlier and have greater fertility. This artificial selection for breeding led to the passing of specific physical characteristics, the creation of distinctive types of dog breeds and the purebred breeders profession.  Purpose  Purebred breeders match parent dogs based on the characteristics they possess and can be improved upon, if the dam has a quality that can be improved on then breeders find a sire that would balance that out. Some of these traits can include cosmetic qualities like size, coat, colors, marks, or other qualities like trainability, temperament, exercise needs and strength. Every characteristic of a dog has been passed down for hundreds or possibly thousands of generations. Appearance, character and temperament are all traits that are consistent with purebred dogs. Due to the amalgamate ancestry of a mixed-breed dog, traits can be inconsistent from generation to generation, it makes the reliability and predictability of breed characteristics nearly impossible. Purebred breeds are specialized for different purposes, such as herding, hunting, companionship and service ability. The dogs are often bred to carry specific traits that will allow them to complete the functions they are bred for. A study in 2004 was able to classify 99% of the dogs under human reproductive control into breed categories based on their DNA sequences. Dogs are grouped into the following eight breed categories of herding, hound, nonsporting, sporting, terrier, toy, working and miscellaneous. As some health problems are hereditary, knowing the common health problems that are related to the type of dog you are trying to breed can be used to improve its successors by mating the dam with a sire who has a pedigree that lacks these health issues. By studying a dog's pedigree, you can avoid breeding dogs known to carry a dominant or recessive genetic mutation as they could pass this onto their offspring.  Breeding  Most mating done by purebred breeders is linebreeding which is the mating of animals of different families within the same breed to bring in desirable traits that are not present in the original animals. Unlike commercial producers, purebred breeders cannot use crossbreeding as it would dilute the breed's purity, resulting in a mixed breed dog. Health checks and genetic screenings are done prior to mating as well. The age at which dogs fully mature varies by breed, however there are stringent guidelines that the parents should not be bred until they are mature enough. For example, the AKC does not allow the registration of a litter from a dam whom at the time of mating was less than 8 months of age or more than 12 years, or of a sire that was less than 7 months or more than 12 years of age.

It is sectioned in the urban districts Hartmannshofen, Pressestadt and Borstei St. Martin church (12. and 13. century) Pelkovenschlössl palace at the square Moosacher St-Martins-Platz Röth lime tree, oldest tree of Munich Borstei Water tower It is surrounded by: Feldmoching-Hasenbergl (north), Milbertshofen-Am Hart (east), Neuhausen-Nymphenburg (south), Pasing- Obermenzing (southwest) and Allach-Untermenzing (west). It has a history of 4000 years of human settlement. History and Structure An almost uninterrupted chain of prehistoric finds suggests a continuous settlement from 4000 years up to the younger Stone Age. Moosach is thus one of the oldest places around and in Munich. The first documentary mention dates from 4 June 807, and the St. Martin's Church in Moosach was built before 1315. Around 1700 the Röth lime tree, Munich's oldest tree, was planted. In 1717 Elector Max Emanuel built the Fasanerie, originally a forester's lodge for raising pheasants, today a beer garden with 1500 seats in the self-service area and another 200 seats in the serviced area. In the 1960s, the Free State of Bavaria transformed the area into a park. In 1818 Nederling joined the municipality of Moosach in the course of community formation. In 1906, construction of the Moosach gasworks on Dachauer Strasse began. Until 30 June 1913, Moosach was an independent municipality and became part of the 28th district of Neuhausen-Moosach, to which the Gern district of the former municipality of Nymphenburg also belonged. With effect from 1 May 1996, all districts of Neuhausen and Nymphenburg were assigned to the urban district of the same name, 9 Neuhausen-Nymphenburg. Thus, the urban district 10 today essentially covers the area of the former municipality of Moosach again, which according to the last list of towns before the incorporation in 1904 covered an area of 1184.44 hectares. The Pelkovenstraße played an important role for Moosach as a salt and trade route. General Eisenhower held several military parades there in 1945/46. He stayed the night at the Netzervilla. Urban development in Moosach essentially only began after the Second World War. Single-family houses, terraced houses and smaller apartment buildings (privately financed, publicly supported and cooperatively) make Moosach a district with a lower residential density than in the inner-city areas. As a result of intensive development of the building areas still available, the population density is also increasing significantly in the areas of Moosachs. To the east, the buildings with the Olympic press town and housing estates from the inter-war period are concentrated. The model settlement Borstei, built between 1924 and 1930 in the southeast corner of the district, is remarkable. In Pelkovenstraße is the oldest church in Moosach and next to it the former rectory. The church belongs to the parish of St. Martin. The former rectory is now rented. Next to it, a stele was erected in honour of Pope Benedict XVI, who had taken up his first post as new priest in St. Martin in 1951 as Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger and lived in the parsonage. The Lutheran parish of Munich Heilig-Geist looks after many faithful in Moosach who gather in three churches: Church of the Holy Spirit, Olympic Church and Magdalene Church. On Pelkovenstraße, the main axis of the old Moosach, the oldest inns in the district mark the expansion of the town into the 19th century. The Alte Wirt, one of Munich's oldest inns, stands at the corner of Dachauer Straße and the Gasthaus Spiegl at the other end of the old Moosach at the corner of Feldmochinger Straße. In 1972 the Olympic Press City for the Olympic Games was built west of Landshuter Allee. The high-rise building at Riesstraße 82 is currently the twelfth tallest building in Munich, 83 meters high. From 2001 to 2004, the Uptown Munich high-rise complex was erected, the second tallest building in the city after the Olympic Tower with a height of 146 meters. With the influx of middle class members to Moosach, where traditionally small tradesmen, workers and ordinary employees lived, the social structure is more balanced today. According to the occupational position, employees and civil servants dominate among the employed. The household structure is still clearly marked by families with children; single-person households are correspondingly underrepresented. Jobs are mainly in the manufacturing industry (automotive and mechanical engineering, textiles and clothing and chemicals), in trade (concentrated at \\"Moosacher Stachus\\" on Dachauerstrasse, Baubergerstrasse, Bunzlauerstrasse and Pelkovenstrasse as well as in the Olympia Shopping Centre and the local supply centre Mona on Hanauer Strasse) and in the service sector. Infrastructure Road With the Mittlerer Ring and Moosacher Straße and their feeder roads, Triebstraße, Dachauer Straße and Von-Kahr- Straße, the district is crossed or touched by several main roads with considerable traffic. The landscape protection areas Kapuzinerhölzl and Hartmannshofer Wald, some allotment gardens and the western cemetery in the district provide a certain ecological balance. Rail Moosach is located on the Munich-Regensburg railway line and is served at Munich-Moosach railway station by the S1 line of the Munich S-Bahn. Since 22 November 1930, the Munich district has been connected to the city centre by today's tram lines 20 and N20. The underground lines U1 and U3 at the Olympia-Einkaufszentrum connect Moosach with the Munich underground network. In December 2010, the continuation of the U3 via another underground station at Moosacher St- Martins-Platz to Moosacher Bahnhof was completed. To make the area around the \\"Moosacher Stachus\\" more attractive, the surface was redesigned after completion of the underground construction and the associated extension of the tram line, which provisionally ended at Pelkovenstraße from 2004 to December 2008. In Moosach there are 38 stops of two subway lines (U-Bahn), one suburban railway (S-Bahn) line, two trams (one of which is a night tram) and nine bus lines. Culture and Education In September 2006, the Christian children's and youth work opened the children's and youth center Die Arche. At present, 40 to 60 children between the ages of five and twelve are cared for daily in a temporary building in Brieger Strasse. Other facilities for young people are the parish of St. Martin and the Mooskito youth centre and the boomerang children's and youth centre at Pelkovenstraße 128. In Ohlauer Straße 16 is the Magdalenenkirche, in Templestraße 5 is the church St. Mauritius, in Lechelstraße 54 the church St. Raphael, in Treibstraße 3 the Christian Free Church Moosach and in Riesstraße 102 the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. In 2007 the vocational school centre Riesstraße was opened. The Kultur- und Bürgerhaus Pelkovenschlössl is the central venue for educational and cultural events. Moosach has an amount of four primary schools and four secondary schools, including the Gymnasium München-Moosach.

From 1950 onward, the school was housed in the historic Patterson- McCormick Mansion. The school closed doors in the mid 70's due to financial pressures. History The Bateman School was founded at 1106 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, in 1937. This is the year that the Director, Miss Alice C Bateman, graduated from Northwestern University. The school was co- educational, non-sectarian with policies based on democratic principles. Five students were in attendance the first day school opened at 1106 Lake Shore Drive. 1000 Lake Shore Drive As enrollment increased, the school was moved in 1941 to 1000 Lake Shore Drive to accommodate over 300 students. At the close of the first year at the new location, the parents requested that a high school be added, and it was agreed that the Director would add a year of high school each successive year. In 1949 the school graduated its first senior high class of fourteen students. All these pupils were able to enter college without examinations, as the Bateman School had attained complete accreditation from the Office of Public Instruction in Springfield, IL. 20 East Burton Place In the spring of 1950 a corporation was formed. The corporation purchased the former home of Cyrus McCormick, at 20 East Burton Place, as the new site for the school. In later years, this historic building became synonymous with Bateman School. The school received its full accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, in nineteen states, and which is recognized throughout the country as well as abroad. One stated goal was to prepare students to be, \\"citizens of the world.http://crthree.net/bateman/history/\\" Languages studies included French, Spanish, Russian and Latin, and were offered in early grades. The school closed its doors in 1976. In that same year, the building had become a liability and there was a move to demolish the building. Eventually the building was sold and developed into condos.

A mutation is a change or error in the genomic sequence of a cell. It can occur during meiosis or replication of DNA, as well as due to ionizing or UV radiation, transposons, mutagenic chemicals, viruses and a number of other factors. Mutations usually (but not always) result in a change in an organisms fitness. These changes are largely deleterious, having a negative effect on fitness; however, they can also be neutral and even advantageous. It is theorized that these mutations, along with genetic recombination, are the raw material upon which natural selection can act to form evolutionary processes. This is due to selection's tendency to \\"pick and choose\\" mutations which are advantageous and pass them on to an organism's offspring, while discarding deleterious mutations. In asexual lineages, these mutations will always be passed on, causing them to become a crucial factor in whether the lineage will survive or go extinct. One way that mutations manifest themselves is behaviour mutation. Some examples of this could be variations in mating patterns, increasingly aggressive or passive demeanor, how an individual learns and the way an individual interacts and coordinates with others. Behaviour mutations have important implications on the nature of the evolution of animal behaviour. They can help us understand how different forms of behaviour evolve, especially behaviour which can seem strange or out of place. In other cases, they can help us understand how important patterns of behaviour were able to arise – on the back of a simple gene mutation. Finally, they can help provide key insight on the nature of speciation events which can occur when a behaviour mutation changes the courtship methods and manner of mating in sexually reproducing species.  History  Ethology, the study of animal behaviour, has been a topic of interest since the 1930s. The pioneers of the field include great names such as Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and Austrian biologists Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz (the three won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns). However, the first published demonstration of how a mutation in a single gene could change an organism's behaviour was carried out by Margaret Bastock in 1956, while she was a Ph.D. student working under Tinbergen at Oxford University. Bastock investigated the yellow mutant of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly. Upon comparison of courtship rituals in 19 yellow mutants and 19 wild types, wild types were noted to court 92% of the time, while yellow ones courted only 83% of the time. In addition, when the yellow mutants courted it took them noticeably longer than the wild types. Even after significant generations of crossing, the flies homozygous for the \\"yellow\\" allele were less successful in mating with wild type females than their heterozygous brothers. These results led Bastock to conclude that the origin of this deficient mating behaviour was the very same mutant gene that caused yellow discolouration. Bastock's work directly and indirectly influenced a new way of observing behaviour patterns and analyzing them, as well as changed the way we look at the evolution of these behavioural patterns in animals. However, it was not until much later that her work was fully recognized and accredited in further studies on genes influencing animal behaviour. Seymour Benzer worked further on D. melanogaster in the 1960s, focusing on different novel phenotypes such as phototaxis and circadian rhythms. In 1978, J.C. Hall returned to a similar focus on courtship while investigating different mutations. Bastock's work had important consequences for the field of neuroscience as well, spurring the emergence of neurogenetics and a new understanding of how our brains work.  Notable experiments  Behaviour mutations have been studied in a variety of animals, but most commonly in Drosophila melanogaster due to being able to produce large numbers with short generation time as well as a rich diversity of behaviours. Many tests have been used in drosophila by specifying behavioural mutations to further understand the nervous system. In order to understand how behaviour is controlled by the nervous system, it is key to identify the neuronal substrates important for the specific activity studied, as well as to explain how they are incorporated into a functional circuit. Most tests used allowed researchers to directly observe the mutation, such as altering phototaxis or flight-reduction. It was also shown in some experiments that certain mutations affect experience-based behaviour. Behavioural mutation has also been extensively tested in mice. In one test involving Drosophila, a temperature- sensitive allele of shibire is overexpressed in neuronal subsets using the GAL4/UAS system. The shi gene is used for synaptic vesicle recycling, and a change in the temperature would cause an accelerated and reversible effect on the synaptic transmission of shi expressing neurons. When shi was tested to cholinergic neurons, the flies showed a quick response to the temperature and were paralyzed within two minutes at 30 degrees, which was reversible. When shi was expressed in photoreceptor cell, fly larva showed temporary temperature-dependent blindness. This experiment shows that shi can be expressed in specific neurons to cause temperature-dependent alterations in behaviours. This research will further be helpful in studying the neuronal subsets in the behaviour of intact animals due to the reversible and controlled manner it is performed in. In more recent studies the Zebrafish ennui mutation was identified from mutagenesis identification for defects in early behaviour. Homozygous ennui embryo swam more slowly than the wild-type but gained normal swimming as it aged. When tested, the motor output of the central nervous system following mechano-sensory stimulation was normal in ennui, which means that the reaction-time and reaction-style were normal to the wild-types and the motoneuron were not affected. The synaptic current at the neuromuscular junction was significantly reduced in ennui which means that the neuromuscular junction was affected. The acetylcholine receptor was significantly reduced in the adult ennui in size as well as localization at the myotome segment borders of fast-twitch muscles. Genetic mosaic analysis revealed that ennui is necessary cell autonomously in muscle fibers for normal synaptic localization of acetylcholine receptors. Also, ennui is very important for agrin function. Ennui is very important in nerve-dependent acetylcholine clustering and the stability of axon growth. In mice, chemical mutagenesis is a phenotype-driven approach to map the mouse mutant catalogue. The usage of mice in behavioural mutation tests allows scientists to increase our understanding of the genetic basis of mammalian behaviour as well as applying this information to human neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders. SHIRPA is a hierarchal screening protocol that efficiently searches for mutations in muscle and lower motor neuron function, Spinocerebellar,sensory neuron function, neuropsychiatry function, and autonomic nervous system function. The mice are then further tested for defects in parameters that are associated with human psychiatric disorders by using two well-known behaviour tests. The mice are tested for locomotor activity (LMA) as well as prepulse inhibition (PPI). For LMA, mice are placed in cages with beam-splitting monitors that will measure the activity of the mice as well as calculate their habituation to that environment. LMA is recorded in 35-minute time spans in bins of a 5-minute duration. The PPI measures the acoustic startle response, which is an exaggerated response to an unexpected stimulus. The acoustic startle is measured over a range of frequencies and amplitudes to calculate the average response. These tests allow us to detect abnormal behaviours and document them.  Behavioural degradation under spontaneous mutation accumulation  In each generation, the genetic variation within a population increases due to accumulation of mutations and decreases in response to natural selection and genetic drift. Mutation accumulation occurs when mutations of small effect accumulate at certain loci, yielding a large phenotypic effect in the aggregate. Multiple genes may simultaneously affect behavioural traits. Spontaneous mutations arise from sources including errors in DNA replication, spontaneous lesions, and transposable genetic elements in the absence of mutagens. Spontaneous mutations play a central role in the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of natural population of many organisms. Evolutionary biologists have used mutation accumulation experiments, in which mutations are allowed to drift to fixation in inbred lines, to study the effect of spontaneous mutations on phenotype character. Phenotypic assays significantly determine whether and how quickly population with accumulated deleterious mutational loads can result in degradation of behavioural responses over time. Based on laboratory experimental evolution with long-term mutation accumulation (MA) lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a team of researchers at the University of Oregon investigated that mutation accumulation of behaviour is capable of generating significant levels of individual variation in ecologically relevant behavioural traits within populations. This variation will be dependent largely on the genetic structure and demographic characteristics of individuals. As a result, small or isolated populations are at high risk of experiencing behavioural degradation. For instance, the rate of mutation for behavioural traits has more effects for behavioural mutation within captive populations and some endangered species. The study of two closely related behavioural traits of the free-living soil nematode C. elegans, chemotaxis and locomotion, indicates that behavioural degradation is a direct source of competitive fitness loss under genomic mutation accumulation. Raymond B. Huey and his colleagues used the same MA lines method, suggesting that mutation accumulation in Drosophila melanogaster significantly depresses only some behavioural traits. There are several explanations for this. It is possible that traits are influenced only by few loci so that their mutational target is small. Alternatively, the values of the behavioural traits are not maximized by directional selection, but rather are under the influence of stabilizing selection. Since behavioural traits are highly variable, mutation accumulation does not negatively affect all traits equivalently.  Sex-ratio behaviour  The study of sex allocation has provided some of the most convincing tests of adaptive behaviour. Theory predicts that organisms can adjust the allocation of resources to male and female offspring in response to environmental conditions. Sex ratio behaviour is the sex ratio response of a female in various conditions. Mutation accumulation is important because it is one evolutionary cause that increases variation between individuals in sex-ratio behaviour. For example, female wasps can adjust their offspring sex ratios by choosing whether to fertilize an egg because they are haplodiploid. In particular, female Nasonia vitripennis produce less males when laying eggs alone, and more males when laying eggs on a patch with other females. If female parasitoid wasps produce too few male offspring, then some of the female offspring will remain unmated. On the other hand, if too many sons are produced, then resources are wasted that could have been used to produce more daughters. Females of other strains show no similar conditional sex ratio behaviours. Researchers find that these behaviours are indeed subject to genetic variation. However, genetic variation in natural population is low and it has low heritability as for other fitness- related traits. The observation of this type of behavioural mutation has been argued to pose a problem for sex-ratio theory because the mutations are likely to have decreased fitness.  Mutations affecting passive/aggressive characteristics  Aggression is a survival trait that can be favoured by Natural Selection in nearly any species. Aggressive individuals can be better able to compete for resources including food, territory and mates, as well as more successful in protecting themselves and their progeny from predators. It can also be energetically costly, and extreme or out of context aggression can be disadvantageous or deleterious, especially in social organisms. Aggression is a complex trait that is regulated by many interacting genes and gene expression is highly variable depending on environment (phenotypic plasticity). Mutations in genes that influence aggressive behaviours can potentially increase aggression or passivity.  Neurotransmitters  Neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin in particular, play an important role in the regulation of aggressive behaviours. Many studies are focused on genes that change the way neurotransmitters interact with receptors within the organism. For example, when individuals suffer from a mutation that causes them to have low levels of serotonin, there is an observed increase in impulsivity and depression With neurotransmitters playing a central role in the development of aggressive behaviour, it follows that many of the gene mutations that have been implicated with aggressive behaviours are involved in the breakdown and/or receipt of neurotransmitters. Alexis Edwards and her team identified 59 mutations in 57 genes that affected aggressive behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster. The results of their research showed that 32 of the mutants displayed increased aggression and 27 of the mutants displayed less aggression than the control group. Several of the genes examined were found to affect nervous system development and function. Aggression was assessed in this experiment by depriving mutant Drosophila flies from food and then allowing them to defend a limited food source. The number of contest competitions between flies was recorded and compared to non-mutant flies to assess whether the mutants were more or less aggressive than the wild type. Examples of mutations that increase aggression are mutations in the fruitless or dissatisfaction genes which result in observable increases in male-male aggression.  Amines  Mutations involving amines have been shown to be a prevalent source of changes in behaviour. A point mutation in the structural gene for Monoamine Oxidase A, also known as MAO-A, is responsible for the breakdown of neurotransmitters. This mutation is X-linked, affecting only males, and eliminates the production of MAO-A. Males afflicted with this mutation are prone to mild mental retardation as well as violent and antisocial behaviour. Another amine affecting aggression is β-alanine which is a bioamine neurotransmitter that has been implicated in Drosophila aggression. A mutation known as the black mutation causes reduced levels of β-alanine and results in less reactive flies than the wild type.  Testosterone  In nearly all species, there is an obvious disequilibrium between frequency and severity of aggression in males versus females. Males are almost always the more aggressive sex and there are genetic differences that back up this observation. A common explanation for this phenomenon is the higher testosterone levels in males. Testosterone levels have a direct effect on neurotransmitter functioning contributing to physical aggression. Mutations affecting neurotransmitters, as stated above, are the dominant cause of changes in aggressive behaviour. Another contributor to the unequal male- female aggression ratio are the sex-linked gene mutations that affect only male behaviour, such as MAO-A mentioned above. These mutations could be the reason why males are nearly always more aggressive than females, although, testosterone levels are a much more feasible explanation. Other evolutionary and genetic explanations of violent behaviour include: dopamine receptors mutations, DRD2 and DRD4, that, when mutate simultaneously, are hypothesized to cause personality disorders, low serotonin levels increasing irritability and gloom and the effects of testosterone on neurotransmitter functioning to explain the increased occurrence of aggression in males.  Effects of mutations on mating  Behavioural mutations play a detrimental part towards the genomes of many species, however, they can greatly affect the outcome of mating; affecting the success of fitness, how many offspring will arise and the likelihood that the male will actually procreate. When mutations affect the mating habits of species, different traits that would otherwise benefit the species procreating are compromised. A couple chemicals that are altered from mutation and have a great impact on mating, are dopamine and serotonin. Each of these chemicals either has a reaction to how the animal acts, or how the species body is formed to benefit their mating success. An example of a mutation in serotonin was found in a species of Nematodes. The serotonin caused their tails to curl during mating, when the mutation occurred the tails did not curl. Without the curling of the tail the nematode was unlikely to find the hermaphrodites sex organs to procreate, and results in less of that nematodes sperm being spread to other offspring. Another example is when the D1 dopamine receptor has a mutation on it; the arousal of a Drosophila melanogaster is increased, which also increases the courtship of the animal. One example of a study was found in the 'yellow' D.melanogaster, the mating of these males was only beneficial when it was dark outside, or when they were in a dark environment. The mutation is not yet known why it occurs this way, but studies have mentioned that the females of this fly species may be turned off by the certain colour of the mutated fly, and therefore in the dark the female is less likely to tell what colour this fly is. A beneficial component of a mutation in the behaviour of a mating D. melanogaster, was when the mutation caused the male to have a longer courtship time period. The flies that had a longer courtship had a tendency to have a higher probability of procreating. This means that the fly that took longer to actually initiate the courtship with the female fly, was more likely to be successful with the female successfully accepting the male.

Based in Mountain View, California, the site allows its members, which it calls \\"Votizens\\", to learn about issues and elections, and take collective action with other committed voters through social media. Votizen verifies that each voice belongs to a real voter in the real world. As of 2012, Votizen had mapped out over a million connections between voters on Votizen. It was acquired by activism platform Causes in 2013. History Votizen was founded by David Binetti, Jason Putorti, and Matt Snider in March 2010. The catalyst for Votizen's growth sprung from the success of a Twitter campaign in 2010 in support of the Startup Visa, where thousands of people tweeted their support of the bill and Votizen delivered the messages to the appropriate people. In September 2010 Votizen announced it had raised $1.5 million in funding led by Peter Thiel and Sean Parker of Founders Fund with participating investors including 500 Startups, David Cowan, Keith Rabois, Ron Conway, Mark Goines, Founder Collective, Felicis Ventures, PivotNorth, Steve Blank, Eric Ries, Shervin Pishevar, and Tom Shields. On September 14, 2011, Votizen conducted the first \\"virtual\\" precinct walk with San Franciscans for Jobs and Good Government, a committee supporting San Francisco mayoral candidate Ed Lee. Votizen was attempting to bring the door-to-door walking in support of candidates to the 21st century by allowing registered voters to express their support for Ed Lee and ask their friends to pledge to vote for Ed Lee. Votizen plans to have their virtual precinct walks boost voter participation and play a big role in the 2012 elections. Randi Zuckerberg, former marketing director at Facebook, spoke about Votizen's virtual precinct walk and believed \\"The virtual precinct walk has the potential to turn conventional campaigning on its head and inspire more people to vote.\\" On September 27, 2011, Votizen won every award in the Social Media Disruptathon at the Washington Post Building in Washington DC. Votizen won in the categories of best presentation, uniqueness, design, most disruptive potential, most liked, and best in show. Votizen competed against a field of nineteen other startups. In February 2012, Votizen announced a $750,000 convertible funding round led by Sean Parker with celebrity investors including Ashton Kutcher, Guy Oseary, and Lady Gaga's manager Troy Carter investing as well. On March 12, 2012 at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, TX; Al Gore and Votizen investor Sean Parker spoke about the internet's effect on politics and Votizen's potential role in politics with Gore saying \\"democracy has been hacked\\" by money and special interests, and tools such as Votizen can provide the fix. On January 10, 2013, Votizen was acquired by Causes, an online civic engagement platform founded by Sean Parker. Leveraging Social Media Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster and Facebook's founding president, is an investor in Votizen and a director on the board of the company. Parker, talking during the 2011 Techonomy conference said, \\"Politics for me is the most obvious area [to be disrupted by the Web]\\". Parker, who said he's “not a huge believer in direct democracy,” is exploring ways to leverage social media to influence politics with investments such as Votizen. His prediction is that \\"taking money out of politics with campaigns is possible through social media.\\" with services like Votizen.

After being trained by Emi Sakura, Ray made her professional wrestling debut in September 2003 and would for the next several years wrestle under different masks, before she began working for Smash in March 2010, unmasked under the ring name Lin Byron (Japanese: リン・バイロン, ) (sometimes transliterated as Lin Bairon). She remained with Smash until the promotion folded in March 2012, after which she transferred over to its successor, Wrestling New Classic (WNC), which lasted until June 2014. In April 2013, Byron became the third WNC Women's Champion. She revived the Ray character in January 2011, initially signing with Ice Ribbon, before becoming a freelancer in May 2012. Afterwards, she mainly worked for the Reina Joshi Puroresu promotion, while also promoting her own independent events and traveling to the United States to work for Shimmer Women Athletes. During her career, Ray held the CMLL-Reina International Junior, International Ribbon Tag Team and WNC Women's Championships, among other titles. After being diagnosed with a brain tumor in December 2015, she died in August 2018. Professional wrestling career Gatokunyan and Ibuki (2003–2011) Trained by Emi Sakura at the Gatokunyan dojo, she made her debut under the ring name Rei (Japanese for \\"Zero\\") on September 15, 2003, facing Sakura in a losing effort at a show in Korakuen Hall. When Sakura left Gatokunyan in April 2006 to form Ice Ribbon, Rei was one of only few of her trainees, who chose not to leave with her, but instead remained with Gatokunyan until the promotion folded in early 2007. The summer of 2007 also saw the folding of the JDStar promotion, where Rei made appearances for six months under a different mask and the ring name Caribbean Moon, working as a member of the Caribbean Gundan stable alongside Caribbean Kim and Caribbean Rum, with all three having characters inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Under the new ring name Ray, she then began working regularly for Mariko Yoshida's Ibuki promotion, which had the goal of introducing the next generation of joshi stars to the world of professional wrestling. While performing in the promotion, Ray also underwent further training under Yoshida, alongside the likes of Hiroyo Matsumoto, Misaki Ohata and Tomoka Nakagawa. In 2009, Ray joined Nanae Takahashi's Passion Red stable, which she would represent in promotions such as NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling, Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), JWP Joshi Puroresu and Oz Academy, performing under the ring name Passion Ray. When Ibuki ceased its operations in early 2010, the Ray character went inactive as its performer began working for Smash unmasked. However, on January 25, 2011, Ray held a press conference, announcing that she was making a comeback on February 5, now working as a freelancer on the Japanese independent circuit. Ice Ribbon (2008, 2011–2012) Ray made her debut for her trainer Emi Sakura's Ice Ribbon promotion on June 1, 2008, when she teamed with Mai Ichii to defeat Sakura and Kazumi Shimouma in the tag team main event. Her next Ice Ribbon appearance took place on February 23, 2011, when she began wrestling regularly for the promotion. Ray quickly began feuding with Ice Ribbon Triple Crown Champion Tsukasa Fujimoto, pinning her in a tag team match on February 26, only Ray's second match back in the promotion. After unsuccessfully challenging Fujimoto for the ICE×60 Championship on March 21, Ray teamed with Emi Sakura five days later to defeat Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. After the match, Ray officially named Ice Ribbon her new home promotion, ending her freelancing days. During the next two months, Ray and Sakura went on to successfully defend the title four times; against Hikari Minami and Yoneyamakao Lee on April 9, Riho and Tsukushi on April 16, Hikaru Shida and Syuri on May 5 and Makoto Oishi and Neko Nitta on May 18. On June 1, Ray and Sakura lost the title to the Lovely Butchers (Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi). Afterwards, Ray began feuding with Chii Tomiya, which lasted until Tomiya left Ice Ribbon in late August. In January 2012, Ray formed the tag team Mascara Voladoras (Spanish for the \\"Masked [Female] Flyers\\") with fellow masked wrestler, JWP representative Leon. They would wrestle together not only in Ice Ribbon, but also JWP and Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. After not appearing for Ice Ribbon for three months, Ray returned to the promotion on May 5 at Golden Ribbon 2012, teaming with Marines Mask II in the Go! Go! Golden Mixed Tag Tournament, from which they were eliminated in the first round by the team of Dynasty and Hikari Minami. On May 14, Ice Ribbon announced that Ray had quit the promotion to once again become a freelancer. Smash (2010–2012) On March 26, 2010, at Smash's first ever event, Ray appeared without her mask, taking part in a wrestling demonstration, where she was introduced by Tajiri as \\"Lin Byron\\" and named as part of the new promotion's roster, having allegedly passed a \\"World Tryout\\" audition. Smash did not recognize Byron's extensive background in professional wrestling, claiming instead that she was a newcomer and that, after graduating Beijing Sport University, she traveled the world with a Chinese acrobatics association, before returning to Hong Kong in 2008 for a career in action movies. As part of the new character, Byron also hid her fluency in Japanese, instead speaking English in her interviews. Byron's character was a high-energy babyface, wrestling matches in a white jumpsuit and often using her martial arts background in matches. She wrestled her first match for Smash on April 23 at Smash.2, teaming with Kushida in a tag team main event, where they defeated Hajime Ohara and Syuri, with Byron pinning Syuri for the win. On May 29 at Smash.3, Byron teamed with Canadian wrestler Mentallo and South Korean comedy wrestler Kim Nan Pun in a six-person tag team match, where they defeated Akira Shoji, Syuri and Yusuke Kodama, with Byron once again picking up the deciding pinfall, this time over Kodama. On June 25 at Smash.4, Byron wrestled as part of the Smash Seikigun (\\"regular army\\") in an interpromotional six person tag team match, where she, Hajime Ohara and Tajiri were defeated by the Fight Club Finland trio of Heimo Ukonselkä, Jessica Love and Stark Adder. Now a member of the Smash Seikigun, Byron spent the following events wrestling in tag team matches with her stablemates Akira, Kushida, Syuri and Tajiri. From September to November, Byron feuded with Kim Nan Pun, ending on November 22 at Smash.10, where Byron pinned Nan Pun in a two-on-one handicap match, where he teamed with Leatherface. On December 24 at Happening Eve, Byron was defeated by Hajime Ohara in an intergender match. During the main event of the evening, where Syuri challenged JWP Openweight Champion Kaori Yoneyama for her title, Byron, along with the rest of the Smash Seikigun, was ringside, but, unlike her stablemates, was not cheering for Syuri and eventually left the ringside area before the end of the match. Following the event, Byron claimed that Smash was playing favorites with Syuri, including holding a birthday party for her, six days before Byron's own birthday, and insisted that Smash was not big enough for both of them. On January 29, 2011, at Smash.12, Byron's losing streak continued as she and Yusuke Kodama were defeated in a tag team match by Hajime Ohara and Jessica Love. After the match, Byron slapped Kodama and then walked out on him as he was attacked by the Triple Tails stable. Later that same day on Smash.13, Byron ended her losing streak by pinning Kodama in a tag team match, where she teamed with Akira Shoji and Kodama with Syuri. After the match, Byron spat at Syuri, leading to a brawl between the two. On February 25 at Smash.14, Byron was defeated by Syuri in a grudge match. After the match, the distraught Byron was comforted by Michael Kovac, who took her under his supervision. At Smash.15, Byron made her first appearance as Lin \\"Bitch\\" Byron. As part of her new villainous persona, she had dyed her hair black and changed her white jumpsuit to a black leather suit. In the match, Byron, Kovac and Gabriel Antonick were defeated by Tajiri, Syuri and Sabu, when Sabu pinned Antonick, who was then abandoned by Byron and Kovac. On May 3 at Smash.16, Byron and Kovac teamed up in a three tag team ladder match, contested for the Smash Championship and Smash Diva Championship belts, which Kovac had stolen earlier from Tajiri. The match, which also included Fight Club Finland representatives Hajime Ohara and Jessica Love, was won by Tajiri and Makoto. With Smash regaining the title belts, they were put up for grabs in separate championship tournaments. Byron entered the Smash Diva Championship tournament on June 9 at Smash.18, but was defeated in her opening match by eventual tournament winner, Kana. Kovac entered the Smash Championship tournament later that same day, but was also defeated in his first round match by Genichiro Tenryu, who was supported by Byron's old rival, Kim Nan Pun. After the match, Kovac blamed Byron for his loss and attacked her, ending the partnership between the two. On July 15 at Smash.19, Byron made her Smash debut under her Ray character, wrestling as a face in a six-person tag team match, where she, Kaz Hayashi and Último Dragón defeated Gamma, Hajime Ohara and Io Shirai via disqualification, when Ohara tore Ray's mask off her face, which she then quickly covered without revealing her true identity. Byron and Ray were treated as two completely different wrestlers, with no mention being made of the two being portrayed by the same person. On August 11 at Smash.20, Ray teamed with Yo-Hey and Yuko Miyamoto to defeat Mio Shirai, Takuya Kito and Yusuke Kodama in another six person tag team match. On September 8 at Smash.21, Ray and the debuting Ayumi Kurihara defeated Makoto and Syuri in a tag team match. Later in the event, after Kana had defeated Serena to become the inaugural Smash Diva Champion, Ray, along with Makoto, Syuri and Tomoka Nakagawa, entered the ring to challenge the new champion. The four challengers had a number one contender's match on October 28 at Smash.22, from which Ray was the first person eliminated by the eventual winner of the match, Nakagawa. Later that same event, during a tag team match, where Michael Kovac and Rob Raw faced Genichiro Tenryu and Yusuke Kodama, Lin Byron made her return to Smash, attacking Kovac and costing his team the match. Even though she had attacked Kovac and appeared in her white jumpsuit, Byron returned to her \\"Bitch\\" character at the Smash.23 press conference, when she came face to face with Syuri. On November 24 at Smash.23, Syuri defeated Byron in a hardcore match, after which the two made peace with each other, officially ending Byron's run as a villain. On February 10, 2012, Smash announced that the promotion would be folding after its March 14 event. In her final Smash appearance on March 14 at Smash.Final, Byron teamed with Kim Nan Pun to defeat Michael Kovac in a two-on-one handicap match. Reina (2011, 2012, 2013–2015) Ray in February 2011 In June 2011, Ray began wrestling regularly for Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina. On September 10, she defeated Puerto Rican Zeuxis in a Two Out of Three Falls tournament final match to become the first ever CMLL-Reina International Junior Champion, a title also recognized by Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Ray made her Mexican debut for CMLL on September 27, teaming with Goya Kong and Marcela to defeat CMLL World Women's Champion La Amapola, Mima Shimoda and La Seductora in a six-woman tag team match. Ray's three-week-long tour of Mexico culminated in a Two Out of Three Falls match on October 18, where she lost the CMLL-Reina International Junior Championship to Silueta. Ray returned to Reina on May 13, 2012, at the promotion's first anniversary event and final event before going out of business, teaming with Mima Shimoda and Tomoka Nakagawa in a six-woman tag team match, where they defeated Dalys la Caribeña, Goya Kong and Zeuxis. On April 6, 2013, Ray made her debut for Reina Joshi Puroresu, the follow-up promotion to Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina, teaming with Leon to defeat Mima Shimoda and Sareee in a main event tag team match. At the June 30 event, Ray unsuccessfully challenged Marcela for the CMLL World Women's Championship. On December 22, Ray and Leon defeated Aki Shizuku and Ariya to win the Reina World Tag Team Championship. Ray and Leon vacated the title on March 28, 2014. On November 20, 2014, the Lin Byron character made its debut for Reina Joshi Puroresu, when she and Syuri entered a tournament for the vacant Reina World Tag Team Championship. After defeating Makomiya (Maki Narumiya and Makoto) in their first round match, Byron and Syuri made it to the finals of the tournament, but were there defeated by Arisa Nakajima and Kana, when Byron turned on Syuri, revealing she had been paid off by Kana. Following the event, Byron began working regularly for Reina as a villain, aligned with Kana. On December 26, Byron defeated Makoto, who was as a result forced to join her and Kana's new stable. Byron returned to Reina on July 10, 2015, to take part in former Smash and WNC wrestler Serena's retirement event, during which she defeated eight other wrestlers to win the \\"Serena Memorial Rumble\\". Shimmer Women Athletes (2012, 2014) On February 9, 2012, American Shimmer Women Athletes announced that Ray would be making her debut for the promotion on March 17. In her debut match on Volume 45, Ray defeated Kellie Skater. Later that same day on Volume 46, Ray teamed with Leon to defeat Davina Rose and Mia Yim in a tag team match. The following day on Volume 47, Ray and Leon unsuccessfully challenged Ayako Hamada and Ayumi Kurihara for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship. Ray's Shimmer weekend ended with her being defeated by Athena on Volume 48. Ray and Leon returned to Shimmer on April 12, 2014, defeating The Canadian NINJAs (Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez) as part of Volume 63 and unsuccessfully challenging the Global Green Gangsters (Kellie Skater and Tomoka Nakagawa) for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship later that same night on Volume 64. The following day, Ray and Leon defeated Cherry Bomb and Kimber Lee on Volume 65, before Ray was defeated by Mia Yim in the final match of her American tour on Volume 66. Wrestling New Classic (2012–2014) On April 5, 2012, Tajiri announced the follow-up promotion to Smash, Wrestling New Classic (WNC), which would hold its first event on April 26. After not appearing at the initial press conference for WNC, Byron was revealed as part of the promotion's roster on April 16. At WNC's first event, Before the Dawn, on April 26, Byron teamed with Yusuke Kodama to defeat Aki Shizuku and Koji Doi in a mixed tag team match. On May 24 at WNC's second event, Starting Over, Byron teamed with Último Dragón and Yusuke Kodama to defeat Josh O'Brien, Tomoka Nakagawa and Yoshiaki Yago in a six-person tag team match, scoring the deciding pinfall over O'Brien. Two days later at Go! Go! West: Osaka, Byron suffered her first WNC loss, when she and Takuya Kito were defeated in a tag team match by Joker (Hayata and Tadasuke). On July 16, Byron, Jiro Kuroshio and Tsubasa defeated The Bodyguard, Mio Shirai and Takuya Kito in the finals of a one night six person tournament to win the 2012 Kito Cup, with Byron pinning the tournament's creator Takuya Kito for the win. On August 2, Byron wrestled her highest profile WNC match up to that point, an intergender match, where she was defeated by Último Dragón. On August 7, Byron main evented her first WNC event, in which she, Tajiri and Yusuke Kodama were defeated by Akira, StarBuck and Syuri. On August 30, Byron formed a new tag team with South African wrestler Adam Angel, with the two also starting a romance storyline. Byron and Angel were victorious in intergender tag team matches against the teams of Sonoko Kato and Takuya Kito, and Mio Shirai and Takuya Kito, before suffering their first defeat at the hands of Akira and Syuri on September 22. On October 26, Byron entered the WNC Women's Championship tournament, but was eliminated in her first round match by Syuri. For WNC's final event of 2012, Byron entered a storyline, where she began training for a confrontation with former sumo champion Akebono. On December 27, Byron, Hailey Hatred and Josh O'Brien were defeated in a six- person tag team match by Akebono, Makoto and Takuya Kito. In early 2013, Byron set her sights on the WNC Women's Championship, however, on March 31, she failed to earn her first shot at the title, when she was defeated by Makoto in a number one contender's match. Byron finally received her title shot on April 25 at WNC's one year anniversary event, where she pinned new champion Makoto in a seven-way match, which also included Arisa Nakajima, Command Bolshoi, Kayoko Haruyama, Nikki Storm and Syuri, to become the third WNC Women's Champion. She made her first successful title defense on July 25 against Serena. However, during the match Byron suffered an ankle injury and, after an examination by a physician, it was announced on July 27 that she had fractured her left ankle, which forced her to relinquish the WNC Women's Championship. Byron returned from her injury on October 31, wrestling rookie Haruka Yoshimura to a draw in a three-minute exhibition match. Byron's official return match took place on November 2, when she and Jiro Kuroshio were defeated in a tag team match by Command Bolshoi and El Hijo del Pantera. On November 29, Byron received her rematch for the WNC Women's Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Syuri. In January 2014, Byron entered a storyline, where she became the only female wrestler in WNC to refuse to sign a dual contract with WNC and Reina Joshi Puroresu (where she already worked regularly under her Ray persona), claiming that she did not want to become affiliated with a group that had Syuri as its \\"ace\\". Byron continued teasing a return to her villainous persona by starting a storyline rivalry with Makoto's Shiritsu Puroresu Gakuen stable in April. The turn came on April 25, when Byron, returning to her black attire and dubbing herself \\"Bitch is Back\\", teamed with Aki Shizuku, Alex Lee and Dump Matsumoto to defeat Makoto and her stablemates Haruka Kato, Kaho Kobayashi and Koharu Hinata in an eight- woman tag team match. On June 18, it was announced that WNC would be shutting down following June 26. This led to the promotion dropping the Byron-Makoto rivalry with the two making peace at the final event due to the Lin Byron character not making the transfer over to Reina. In storyline, Lin Byron returned to Hong Kong after the closing of WNC. Freelancing (2012–2015) After leaving Ice Ribbon and once again becoming a freelancer, Ray held a special fan gathering on November 15, 2012, during which she announced that she was going to produce a series of her own independent events, which would culminate in her tenth anniversary event to be held at Korakuen Hall. The first of these events took place on December 2 at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring and saw Ray team with Tigre Blanco, the masked persona of Tajiri, in a mixed tag team main event, where they were defeated by noki-A and Último Dragón. On December 9, Ray returned to Oz Academy, teaming with Leon in a tag team match, where they were defeated by A☆YU☆MI and noki-A. Ray's second \\"10th Anniversary Road to Korakuen Hall\\" event took place on April 21, 2013, at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring and saw her and Tajiri defeat Gran Hamada and Leon in a main event tag team match. On April 29, Lin Byron made her first appearance outside of Smash/WNC, when she took part in World Wonder Ring Stardom's big Ryōgoku Cinderella event at Ryōgoku Kokugikan, teaming with Gota Ihashi, Kota Ibushi and Mayu Iwatani in an eight-person tag team match, where they defeated Eri Susa, Hikaru Sato, Makoto and Michael Nakazawa. Ray's next self-produced event took place on July 13 in Kasukabe and saw her team with El Hijo del Pantera and Tajiri in a six- person tag team main event, where they defeated Command Bolshoi, Gran Hamada and Kid Tiger. On November 24, Ray returned to JWP Joshi Puroresu, when she and Leon defeated Kayoko Haruyama and Manami Katsu in the first round of a tournament for the vacant JWP and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championships. Ray and Leon were defeated in the finals of the tournament on December 15 by Dash Chisako and Sendai Sachiko. On January 19, 2014, Ray produced another event at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, which saw her and Leon put their masks on the line in a main event tag team match against La Comandante and Meiko Satomura. Ray won the match by pinning La Comandante and thus saved her mask. From January 19 to March 2, Ray and Leon took part in JWP's 2014 Tag League the Best. After two wins, the team went into the final day of the round-robin portion of the tournament leading their block, but a loss to Kayoko Haruyama and Manami Katsu cost them their spot in the finals. However, when Katsu suffered an ankle injury, Ray and Leon were given her and Haruyama's spot in the finals of the tournament. On March 16, Mascara Voladoras were defeated in the finals of the tournament by Haruusagi (Rabbit Miu and Tsukushi). That same day, Ray produced another independent event at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, which saw her, Leon and Command Bolshoi defeat Dump Matsumoto, Nassy and Zeus in a main event six-person tag team match. On May 11, Ray produced another event at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, which featured several wrestlers adopting new masked personas with Ray working a six-woman tag team main event under the ring name \\"Ray Misterico\\". Following the match, Ray wrestled the soon-to-retire Natsuki☆Taiyo to a draw in a special three-minute match. On August 30 and 31, Ray took part in two shows promoted by the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) in Pyongyang, North Korea. At the first event, Ray teamed with Kyoko Kimura to defeat Dash Chisako and Meiko Satomura in a tag team match and at the second event with Satomura to defeat Chisako and Kimura. On September 25, Ray produced her eleventh anniversary event in Shinjuku Face, teaming with Syu☆ri in a tag team main event, where they defeated Leon and \\"Meiko Satomura Deluxe\\". On October 10, 2014, Ray revived her Lin Byron character at an Akira produced Wrestle-1 event, where she teamed with Akira in a tag team match, where they defeated Nosawa Rongai and Syuri. On October 25, Ray worked her first main Wrestle-1 event, defeating Kyusei Sakura Hirota. On December 28, 2014, Ray and Leon, the team now renamed Voladoras L×R, defeated Command Bolshoi and Kyoko Kimura to win the JWP Tag Team and Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championships. They lost the title to Dash Chisako and Sendai Sachiko in their fifth defense on July 26, 2015. On April 3, 2015, Ray was announced as part of the roster of the newly revived FMW promotion. She made her debut for FMW on April 21 at the promotion's first event in thirteen years, where she and Miss Mongol defeated Kagetsu and Kyusei Sakura Hirota in a tag team match. She worked all subsequent events in the first three FMW revival tours, which lasted until June 30. On October 8, 2015, Ray held her 12th anniversary event, which saw her team with Atsushi Onita and Hideki Hosaka in a six-person barbed wire board match, where they were defeated by Arisa Nakajima, Nosawa Rongai and Sabu. Personal life Outside of professional wrestling, Ray sung and played the piano and composed several songs of her own, which she performed at special fan gatherings. On May 31, 2015, Ray took part in NPCJ's Blaze Open bodybuilding competition, where she finished second in the women's athlete category, beating fellow professional wrestlers Command Bolshoi and Meiko Satomura, who finished third and fourth, respectively. On September 26, 2012, she helped arrest a sex offender on board the Shōnan-Shinjuku Line train. At around 10:00 a.m. Ray noticed a man \\"stroking his genitals\\" in the crowded train, grabbed the man in a wrist lock, got him out of the train and handed him off to the police. Brain tumor and death In December 2015, Ray was diagnosed with a brain tumor after going to an MRI following a concussion. She underwent a brain biopsy to determine the nature of the tumor on January 21, 2016. On February 17, Ray announced that the biopsy had determined that the tumor was a malignant Stage III tumor. Due to the cancer cells being attached to nerves, the tumor was also inoperable. Ray then began undergoing radiation therapy until the end of April. She stated that she was planning to return to wrestling at an FMW event on May 5, 2017, a date where Hayabusa was planning to make his return before his death. On May 6, Ray underwent emergency surgery for hydrocephalus. She died on August 30, 2018.

Targeted killing is defined as a form of assassination which is carried out by governments against their perceived enemies. Analysts believe that it is a modern euphemism for the assassination (prominent premeditated killing) of an individual by a state organization or institution outside a judicial procedure or a battlefield. Since the late 20th century, the legal status of targeted killing has become a subject of contention within and between various nations. Historically, at least since the mid-eighteenth century, Western thinking has generally considered the use of assassination as a tool of statecraft to be illegal. Some academics, military personnel and officials describe targeted killing as legitimate within the context of self-defense, when employed against terrorists or combatants engaged in asymmetrical warfare. They argue that drones are more humane and more accurate than manned vehicles, and that targeted or \\"named killings\\" do not occur in any context other than a declared state of war. Some twenty-six members of United States Congress, with academics such as Gregory Johnsen and Charles Schmitz, media figures (Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald,\\"The Assassination Complex\\": Jeremy Scahill & Glenn Greenwald Probe Secret US Drone Wars in New Book . Democracy Now! 3 May 2016. James Traub), civil rights groups (i.e. the American Civil Liberties Union) and ex-CIA station chief in Islamabad, Robert Grenier, have criticized targeted killings as a form of extrajudicial killings, which may be illegal within the United States and possibly under international law. According to statistical analyses provided by Reprieve, 9 children have been killed for every targeted adult the United States has tried to assassinate, and, in numerous failed attempts to kill Ayman al-Zawahri, the CIA has killed 76 children and 29 adult bystanders. Scholars are also divided as to whether targeted killings are an effective counterterrorism strategy. Africa Targeted killings have also been used in Somalia, Kenya, Rwanda and in Libya.  Somalia and Rwanda, 1990s  During fighting in the Somali Civil War, Sean Devereux described torture and killing by warlords in Kismayo as \\"targeted killings, a kind of ethnic cleansing\\", shortly before his assassination. Also in Africa, Reuters described \\"targeted killings of political opponents\\" by Hutu army and militias in Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. The American State Department reported the \\"politically targeted killings\\" were a prelude to general massacres in Rwanda. Americas During the 1980s and 1990s, targeted killings were employed extensively by death squads in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, and Haiti within the context of civil unrest and war. During the George W. Bush Administration,David Johnston and David E. Sanger, \\"Threats and Responses: Hunt for Suspects\\" , The New York Times, 6 November 2002. targeted killings became a frequent tactic of the United States government in the War on Terror. Time was reserved on the President's schedule on Tuesday every week for Bush to review and approve the killing of selected targets, without judicial process.Clive Stafford Smith,\\"Who's getting killed today? Terror, Tuesday, the US Disposition Matrix and a modern history of state-sponsored assassination\\" , Times Literary Supplement, 30 June 2017 pp.3–5, p. 3 Instances of targeted killing by the United States that have received significant attention include the killing of Osama bin Laden and of American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and his teenage son in 2011. Under the Obama administration, use of targeted killings expanded, most frequently through use of combat drones operating in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen.  American and Russian drug cartels, 1980s  Referring to killings by drug cartels in Washington, D.C. in 1989, mayor Marion Barry infamously stated, \\"Washington should not be called the murder capital of the world. We are the targeted-killing capital of the world.\\" Barry said that \\"targeted killings\\" by D.C.'s cartels were comparable to those during the days of \\"Al Capone and Eliot Ness\\" at the time of Prohibition in the United States. Similarly, drug-related \\"mob hits\\" in Moscow during the 1990s were euphemistically described as \\"targeted killings\\" by the Cox News Service and Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Central and South America  Operation Condor participants. Green: active members. Blue: collaborator. The U.S.-backed Operation Condor was a campaign of political repression and state terror in Latin American right-wing dictatorships involving assassination of political opponents and dissidents. The National Security Archive reported, \\"Prominent victims of Condor include two former Uruguayan legislators and a former Bolivian president, Juan José Torres, murdered in Buenos Aires, a former Chilean Minister of the Interior, Bernardo Leighton, as well as former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his 26-year-old American colleague, Ronni Moffitt, assassinated by a car bomb in downtown Washington D.C.\\" In 1986, the human rights group Americas Watch released a report stating that death squads and armed forces under President José Napoleón Duarte in El Salvador had carried out 240 targeted killings throughout 1985. The report relied upon figures provided by the Roman Catholic Church and included allegations of torture and summary executions. Americas Watch and other rights groups reported \\"targeted killing\\" of civilians by the Nicaraguan Sandinista government in the following year during its campaign against the Contras. Politically motivated targeted killings of trade unionists and activists were also recorded in Haiti and Colombia during the late 1980s and 1990s. Targeted killings linked to the drug trade and paramilitary organizations including FARC and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) resulted in large numbers of deaths among human rights and political activists, and women and children, throughout the 1990s.  North America  = Use by United States government = An early example of American targeted killing is Operation Vengeance during World War II. This counterattack shot down the plane of Isoroku Yamamoto, the senior planner of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The CIA recruited Sam Giancana (pictured), Santo Trafficante and other mobsters to assassinate Fidel Castro. During the Vietnam War, the Phoenix Program targeted political leadership of the Viet Cong for assassination. During the period 1976–2001, there was an American norm against targeted killing. The United States has made targeted killing—the deliberate assassination of a known terrorist outside the country's territory, usually by airstrike—an essential part of its counter-terrorism strategy. Hence, the United States has justified the killing of terrorists under a war paradigm. \\"Using the war paradigm for counter-terrorism enabled government lawyers to distinguish lethal attacks on terrorists from prohibited assassinations and justify them as lawful battlefield operations against enemy combatants, much like the uncontroversial targeted killing of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto while he was traveling by a military airplane during World War II.\\" Graph of average casualties in drone strikes ordered by the United States in Yemen, 2002–Present. Further support for the U.S. government's use of drone strike tactics is found in a report found in the Journal of Strategic Security concerning the surgical nature of drone strikes for use in a populated area. The author concedes, \\"Indeed the tactic of using drones promises the ability of eliminating enemies in complex environments, while minimizing the political implications of resorting to war.\\" The domestic legislative basis offered to justify drone strikes is the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF), a joint resolution of both houses of Congress passed exactly one week after 11 September 2001. The AUMF permits the President to use \\"all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons\\". A report published in the Journal of Strategic Security focusing on the future of drones in geopolitics finds the U.S. government's use of drones in targeted killing operations an \\"indiscriminant and disproportionate use of force that violates the sovereignty of Pakistan\\". In early 2010, with President Barack Obama's approval, Anwar al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be approved for targeted killing by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011. A Reuters report analysing the killing of 500 \\"militants\\" by US drones between 2008 and 2010 found that only 8% of those killed were mid- to top-tier organisers or leaders; the rest were unidentified foot soldiers.Washington Report on Middle East Affairs. January/February 2013 Vol. XXXII, No. 1. p.35 The Intercept reported, \\"Between January 2012 and February 2013, U.S. special operations airstrikes [in northeastern Afghanistan] killed more than 200 people. Of those, only 35 were the intended targets. During one five-month period of the operation, according to the documents, nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets.\\"\\"The Obama Administration's Drone-Strike Dissembling \\".

The Intercept. 15 October 2015. = Obama Administration position on combat drones = In a speech titled \\"The Ethics and Efficacy of the President's Counterterrorism Strategy\\" John O. Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, outlined on 30 April 2012 at the Wilson Center the use of combat drones to kill members of al-Qaeda by the US Federal government under President Barack Obama. John Brennan acknowledged for the first time that the US government uses drones to kill selected members of al-Qaeda. He justified the use of drones both from domestic law and international law point of view. With respect to domestic law Brennan stated, \\"as a matter of domestic law, the Constitution empowers the President to protect the nation from any imminent threat of attack. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress after the 11 September attacks authorizes the president \\"to use all necessary and appropriate force\\" against those nations, organizations and individuals responsible for 9/11. There is nothing in the AUMF that restricts the use of military force against al-Qa'ida to Afghanistan.\\" And he further said: \\"As a matter of international law, the United States is in an armed conflict with al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, in response to the 9/11 attacks, and we may also use force consistent with our inherent right of national self-defense. There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.\\" The speech came a few days after Obama authorized the CIA and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to fire on targets based solely on their intelligence \\"signatures\\" — patterns of behavior that are detected through signals intercepts, human sources and aerial surveillance, and that indicate the presence of an important operative or a plot against U.S. interests. Under the previous rules the CIA and the US military were only allowed to use drone strikes against known terrorist leaders whose location could be confirmed and who appeared on secret CIA and JSOC target lists. The justification by Brennan built upon remarks by US top officials like the State Department's top lawyer Harold Hongju Koh, US Attorney General Eric Holder, the US Defense Department general counsel Jeh Johnson and President Obama himself, who defended the use of drones outside of so-called \\"hot battlefields\\" like Afghanistan. John O. Brennan, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and chief counter-terrorism advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011/2012, the process for selecting targets outside of warzones was altered so that power was concentrated in the hands of a group of people in the White House centered around White House counterterror chief John Brennan. Under the new plan, Brennan's staff compiles the potential target list and runs the names past agencies such as the State Department at a weekly White House meeting. According to the New York Times, President Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top secret process to designate terrorists for kill or capture, reserving the final say on approving lethal action, and signs off every strike in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. U.S. Congressional oversight over the targeted killing operations increased as the drone program intensified under the Obama Administration. Once a month, a group of staff members from the House and Senate intelligence committees would watch videos of the latest drone strikes, review intelligence that was used to justify each drone strike, and sometimes examine telephone intercepts and after-the-fact evidence, such as the CIA's assessment of who was hit. The procedure used by House and Senate intelligence committees to monitor CIA drone strikes was set up largely at the request of Senator Dianne Feinstein who became determined to ensure that it was as precise as the CIA had been claiming. \\"That's been a concern of mine from the beginning,\\" Feinstein said in little-noticed comments after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. \\"I asked that this effort be established. It has been. The way in which this is being done is very careful.\\" Feinstein explained how the oversight works in general. \\"We receive notification with key details shortly after every strike, and we hold regular briefings and hearings on these operations,\\" Feinstein wrote in May in a letter sent in response to a column that ran in the Los Angeles Times questioning the oversight of drone strikes. \\"Committee staff has held 28 monthly in-depth oversight meetings to review strike records and question every aspect of the program including legality, effectiveness, precision, foreign policy implications and the care taken to minimize noncombatant casualties.\\" If the congressional committees objected to something, the lawmakers could call CIA leaders to testify in closed investigative hearings. If unsatisfied, they could pass legislation limiting the CIA's actions. Congressional criticism of drone strikes has been rare. However, in June 2012, 26 lawmakers, all but two of them Democrats, signed a letter to Obama questioning so-called signature strikes, in which the U.S. attacks armed men who fit a pattern of behavior that suggests they are involved in terrorist activities. Signature strikes have been curbed in Pakistan, where they once were common, but in 2012 Obama gave the CIA permission to conduct them in Yemen, where an Al Qaeda affiliate that has targeted the United States has established a safe haven in the south. The lawmakers expressed concern that signature strikes could kill civilians. They added: \\"Our drone campaigns already have virtually no transparency, accountability or oversight.\\" While the Bush administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda, the use of combat drones underwent a quiet and unheralded shift during the Obama Administration to focus increasingly on killing militant foot soldiers rather than high-value targets according to CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Bergen noted: \\"To the extent that the targets of drone attacks can be ascertained, under Bush, al Qaeda members accounted for 25% of all drone targets compared to 40% for Taliban targets. Under Obama, only 8% of targets were al Qaeda compared to just over 50% for Taliban targets.\\" Minneapolis anti-war protest: 'Stop Killer Drones', 5 May 2013 Facing the possibility of defeat in the 2012 Presidential election, the Obama administration accelerated work in the weeks before the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures. The work to codify U.S. drone policy began in summer 2011. \\"There was concern that the levers might no longer be in our hands,\\" said one unnamed U.S official. With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an \\"amorphous\\" program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mitt Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said. \\"One of the things we've got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in terms of some of the decisions that we're making,\\" Obama said and added \\"creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, is going to be a challenge for me and my successors for some time to come.\\" U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. \\"There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems,\\" he said. In response lawsuits brought by The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union seeking to use the Freedom of Information Act to make public more details about the legal basis for the drone programs U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon ruled at the end of December 2012 that the U.S. Government has no legal duty to disclose legal opinions justifying the use of drones to kill suspected terrorist operatives abroad. While noting that a more detailed disclosure of the administration's legal rationale \\"would allow for intelligent discussion and assessment of a tactic that (like torture before it) remains hotly debated\\", McMahon came to the conclusion that the Freedom of Information Act did not permit her to require such transparency. In a letter dated 22 May 2013 to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee, Patrick J. Leahy, U.S. attorney general Eric Holder wrote that the United States will use lethal force by combat drones \\"in a foreign country against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al Qa'ida or its associated forces, and who is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans, in the following circumstances: (1) the U.S. government has determined, after a thorough and careful review, that the individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States; (2) capture is not feasible; and (3) the operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles.\\" In a Presidential Policy Guidance entitled \\"U.S. Policy Standards and Procedures for the Use of Force in Counterterrorism Operations Outside the United States and Areas of Active Hostilities\\" from May 2013 the United States government stated that lethal force by combat drones \\"will be used only to prevent or stop attacks against U.S. persons, and even then, only when capture is not feasible and no other reasonable alternatives exist to address the threat effectively\\". The U.S. government further declared, \\"lethal force will be used outside areas of active hostilities only when the following preconditions are met: * First, there must be a legal basis for using lethal force. * Second, the United States will use lethal force only against a target that poses a continuing, imminent threat to U.S. persons. * Third, the following criteria must be met before lethal action may be taken: :# Near certainty that the terrorist target is present; :# Near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed; :# An assessment that capture is not feasible at the time of the operation; :# An assessment that the relevant governmental authorities in the country where action is contemplated cannot or will not effectively address the threat to U.S. persons; and :# An assessment that no other reasonable alternatives exist to effectively address the threat to U.S. persons. U.S. President Barack Obama touched on the subject of combat drones in a speech on Counterterrorism delivered on 23 May 2013 at the National Defense University. \\"It is a hard fact that US strikes have resulted in civilian casualties,\\" he said, adding, \\"These deaths will haunt us. But as commander-in-chief I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternative. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties.\\" Obama said new guidance allowed targeting only those terrorists posing \\"a continuing and imminent threat to the American people\\", which administration officials said meant only individuals planning attacks on the U.S. homeland or against U.S. persons abroad. Obama defended the use of drones as just because America \\"is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban and their associated forces\\". To stop terrorists from gaining a foothold, drones will be deployed according to Obama, but only when there is an imminent threat; no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist; \\"near certainty\\" that civilians won't be harmed; and \\"there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat\\". Never will a strike be punitive. A report by Ben Emmerson QC, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, who identified 33 drone strikes around the world that have resulted in civilian casualties and may have violated international humanitarian law urged the United States \\"to further clarify its position on the legal and factual issues ... to declassify, to the maximum extent possible, information relevant to its lethal extraterritorial counter- terrorism operations; and to release its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used\\". Human Rights Watch said that in Yemen more civilians were killed than admitted by the Obama administration, while Amnesty International said the same of drone strikes in Pakistan. Caitlin Hayden, a White House spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reports, but said in an e-mail statement: \\"As the President emphasized, the use of lethal force, including from remotely piloted aircraft, commands the highest level of attention and care.\\" While the U.S. government is considering whether to kill an American abroad suspected of planning terrorist attacks and how to do so legally under new stricter targeting policy issued in 2013, The Intercept reported that the U.S. government is using primarily NSA surveillance to target people for drone strikes overseas. In its report The Intercept the author details the flawed methods which are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting in the deaths of innocent people. According to the Washington Post, NSA analysts and collectors (i.e. NSA personnel who control electronic surveillance equipment) use the NSA's sophisticated surveillance capabilities to track individual targets geographically and in real time, while drones and tactical units aim their weaponry against those targets to take them out. NBC News released in February 2014 an undated Department of Justice White paper entitled \\"Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa'ida or An Associated Force\\" in which the Obama Administration concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be \\"senior operational leaders\\" of al-Qaida or \\"an associated force\\" – even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S. However any such targeted killing operation by the United States would have to comply with the four fundamental law-of-war principles governing the use of force which are necessity, distinction, proportionality and humanity – i.e., the avoidance of unnecessary suffering. (Page 8 of). The memo also discusses why targeted killings would not be a war crime or violate a U.S. executive order banning assassinations: \\"A lawful killing in self-defense is not an assassination. In the Department's view, a lethal operation conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that would not violate the assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and would not violate the assassination ban.\\" In 2013, a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty proposed that U.S. government drone policy in Pakistan potentially violated human rights according to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The rights in direct question were the right to life; right to a fair trial; the freedom of association; right to protection of the family; and, less directly, right to highest attainable health standards; right to education; and right of freedom from hunger. On 21 April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the above-mentioned December 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon and ruled that the Obama administration must release documents justifying its drone-killings of Americans and foreigners. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal released on 23 June 2014 a Juli 2010 memo by then U.S. Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel David Barron which outlined the rationale for killing the American Citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi. = Trump Administration position on combat drones = CIA-ordered drone strikes were eventually ended by President Obama, who transferred control entirely to the U.S. military, under a separate legal authority. President Trump reversed this decision in 2017. A 2016 Obama executive order requiring an annual report of civilian deaths from US airstrikes outside combat zones was not complied with by the Trump administration for 2017 and was then revoked by an executive order in 2019. According to the BBC, citing the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a UK-based left wing think tank, there were 2,243 drone strikes in the first two years of the Trump presidency, compared with 1,878 in Mr Obama's eight years in office. According to press reports, the Trump administration has at times employed a drone missile that deploys flying blades rather than explosives to kill targets, because it's hoped to decrease non-combatant casualties. The missile is believed to have seen its first combat action in the 2017 killing of Abu Khayr al-Masri.  Asia   Use by Iranian government  alt= Alleged and confirmed assassinations were reported to have been conducted by the Islamic Republic of Iran and previously by the Pahlavi regime. It includes attempts on notable persons who were reported to have been specifically targeted by the various Iranian security and intelligence forces, most notably against Kurdish dissidents of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran in the 1980s and 1990s. Prior to the establishment of the Islamic State in 1979, the Organization of Intelligence and National Security also allegedly performed a number of political motivated assassinations against dissidents and opposition leaders.  Use by Saudi Arabia   Use by Israel  According to Ronen Bergman, \\"since World War II, Israel has used assassination and targeted-killing more than any other country in the West, in many cases endangering the lives of civilians.\\"Ronen Bergman, 'How Arafat Eluded Israel’s Assassination Machine,' New York Times Magazine 23 January 2018 assassinated Iranian scientists During the First Intifada Palestinian uprising, the Palestinian human-rights group Al Haq condemned Israeli soldiers for what they described as \\"deliberate, cold-blooded... targeted\\" killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The human rights group, Middle East Watch, alleged in 1993 that interviewed Israeli soldiers had targeted often unarmed Palestinians, some under the age of 16, for \\"premeditated assassinations\\" or targeted killing, a charge denied by Israeli officials. The allegations included the execution of Palestinians in custody. Controversy over targeted killings continued during the Second Intifada. Palestinians charged that individuals belonging to the group Hamas and shot in targeted killings were being assassinated; Israeli stated that those killed were responsible for attacks against Israelis. Israeli officials initially accepted responsibility for only some of the killings, and Israeli media termed the practice a \\"liquidations policy\\", whereas Palestinians called it \\"state terrorism\\". In January 2001 Israeli officials confirmed \\"the practice of targeted assassinations\\". Conflict in Israel over the legality of the practice centered on the case of Dr. Thabet Thabet, assassinated as he left his home on New Year's Eve. Dr. Thabet was alleged by the Israeli military to be a senior local leader of Fatah and plotting attacks against Israelis in the West Bank. A dentist, Dr. Thabet was also a friend of many Israeli peace activists and considered one himself. Israeli activists called the killing \\"a crime\\", \\"Mafia-style\\", and \\"immoral\\". Ephraim Sneh, then Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, described the policy as \\"effective, precise and just\\". The Washington Post commented that Israeli policy of targeted killing during the Second Intifada expanded upon previous policies, targeting not only terrorists but also those thought to direct or coordinate them. Another controversial killing, which occurred following the Bush Administration's condemnation of the practice, was that of Mahmoud Madani, a leader of Hamas shot while leaving a mosque in the Balata refugee camp. The Israeli military suspected Madani of plotting bombings in Israel. At that time, spokesman for the U.S. State Department Richard Boucher condemned both violence by Palestinians and targeted killings by Israelis during a State Department news briefing. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell registered his opposition to \\"a policy of targeted killings\\" and the U.S. State Department urged Israel to stop them.

On 6 August, he warned drug dealers: \\"My order is shoot to kill you. I don’t care about human rights, you better believe me\\".

A month later, when he was President-elect, Duterte offered medals and cash rewards for citizens that shot dealers dead. \\"Do your duty, and if in the process you kill 1,000 persons because you were doing your duty, I will protect you\\", he told police officers on 1 July, the day after his inauguration. He was speaking at a ceremony installing dela Rosa, his loyal henchman, as the nation’s top cop. \\"If you know of any addicts, go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful\\", he was quoted as saying to another crowd that day.' Syria During a 2016 visit to Damascus, British statesman David Davis was shown by Syria's Bashar al-Assad a spreadsheet outlining the identities of 783 whose targeted killing he had approved.  Europe   In Bosnia and Serbia  Referring to human rights abuses during the Bosnian War, the U.S. State Department noted politically or ethnically motivated \\"targeted killings\\" in Bosnia in Section 1a., \\"Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing\\", of its 1993 report on human rights practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Targeted killings were also reported by Serbian and Albanian forces during the Kosovo War. Both wars involved large scale targeted killings of journalists.  Use by the Russian government  During the First Chechen War, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudaev was killed on 21 April 1996 by two laser-guided missiles when he was using a satellite phone, after his location was detected by a Russian reconnaissance aircraft, which intercepted his phone call. On 20 March 2002, Ibn al-Khattab, who led his militia against Russian forces in Chechnya during the First and Second Chechen War, setting up many effective ambushes against Russian forces as well as managing the influx of foreign fighters and money, was killed when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian FSB gave Khattab a poisoned letter. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with \\"a fast-acting nerve agent, possibly sarin or a derivative\\". On 13 February 2004, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who served as acting president of the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria between 1996 and 1997, was killed when a bomb ripped through his SUV in the Qatari capital, Doha. Yandarbiyev was seriously wounded and died in hospital. His 13-year-old son Daud was seriously injured.\\"Top Chechen separatist dies in Qatar bomb blast\\" , The Guardian, 14 February 2004 The day after the attack, Qatari authorities arrested three Russians in a Russian embassy villa. One of them, the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Qatar, Aleksandr Fetisov, was released in March due to his diplomatic status and the remaining two, the GRU agents Anatoly Yablochkov (also known as Belashkov) and Vasily Pugachyov (sometimes misspelled as Bogachyov), were charged with the assassination of Yandarbiyev, an assassination attempt of his son Daud Yandarbiyev, and smuggling weapons into Qatar. Sergei Ivanov has promised to strive for discharge of the Russian prisoners in Qatar , Lenta.ru, 3 March 2004 There were some speculations that Fetisov had been released in exchange for Qatari wrestlers detained in Moscow.\\"Let Go\\" , Kommersant, 25 March 2004 On 30 June 2004, both Russians were sentenced to life imprisonment; passing the sentence, the judge stated that they had acted on orders from the Russian leadership.\\"Russia 'behind Chechen murder'\\" , BBC News, 30 June 2004Aslan Maskhadov Killed , Kommersant, 9 March 2005 Задержанные в Катаре – офицеры ГРУ , Gazeta.ru, 29 April 2004 But on 23 December 2004, Qatar agreed to extradite the prisoners to Russia, where they would serve out their life sentences. The agents however received a heroes' welcome on returning to Moscow in January 2005 but disappeared from public view shortly afterwards. The Russian prison authorities admitted in February 2005 that they were not in jail, but said that a sentence handed down in Qatar was \\"irrelevant\\" in Russia.\\"Convicted Russia agents 'missing'\\" , BBC News, 17 February 2005 On 10 July 2006 Shamil Basayev, a Chechen militant leader who was alleged to be responsible for numerous guerrilla attacks on security forces in and around ChechnyaNo Terrorist Acts in Russia Since Beslan: Whom to Thank? and the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and described by ABC News as \\"one of the most- wanted terrorists in the world\\", was killed by an explosion near the border of North Ossetia in the village of Ali-Yurt, Ingushetia, a republic bordering Chechnya. According to the official version of Basayev's death, the FSB, following him with a drone, spotted his car approaching a truck laden with explosives that the FSB had prepared, and by remote control triggered a detonator in the explosives. Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium, which a public inquiry in the UK concluded was carried out by FSB agents. US and UK intelligence agents reportedly say they believe Russian assassins and possibly the Russian government could have been behind at least fourteen targeted killings on British soil, which were dismissed as non-suspicious by UK police. Ukrainian authorities have blamed Russian security services for multiple killings in Ukraine. The Russian government is alleged by the British government of being behind a failed assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal and his daughter using a Novichok agent.  Legality  While article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by one state against another, two exceptions are relevant to the question of whether targeted killings are lawful: (1) when the use of force is carried out with the consent of the host state; and (2) when the use of force is in self- defense in response to an armed attack or an imminent threat, and where the host state is unwilling or unable to take appropriate action. The legality of a targeted drone strike must be evaluated in accordance with international humanitarian law (IHL), including the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity. The part of The Charter of the United Nations that regulates \\"action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression\\" is Chapter VII (articles 39–50), which requires that it is the Security Council that determines any threat to peace and decides on measures to be taken to maintain or restore peace. Article 51 mentions the only exception, as being members of the United Nations have \\"the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security\\".\\"CHAPTER VII: ACTION with RESPECT to THREATS to the PEACE, BREACHES of the PEACE, and ACTS of AGGRESSION\\" \\". Charter of the United Nations. Targeted killing operations, according to Harvard Law School Professors Gabriella Blum and Philip Heymann, amplify the tension between addressing terrorism as a crime versus addressing terrorism as an act of war. Governments pursuing a law enforcement strategy punish persons for their individual guilt, which must be proven in a court of law, where the accused enjoys the protections of due process guarantees. Governments in the midst of war, on the other hand, may claim a legal obligation to take advantage of the relaxation of peacetime constraints on the use of deadly force. Enemy combatants may be targeted and killed not because they are guilty, but because they are potentially lethal agents of a hostile party. No advance warning is necessary, no attempt to arrest or capture is required, and no effort to minimize casualties among enemy forces is demanded by law. The tactic raises complex questions as to the legal basis for its application, who qualifies as an appropriate \\"hit list\\" target, and what circumstances must exist before the tactic may be employed. Opinions range from people considering it a legal form of self-defense that reduces terrorism, to people calling it an extrajudicial killing that lacks due process, and which leads to more violence. Methods used have included firing a Hellfire missile from an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter (Israel), or a Predator or Reaper drone (an unmanned, remote-controlled plane), detonating a cell phone bomb, and long-range sniper shooting. Countries such as the U.S. (in Pakistan and Yemen) and Israel (in the West Bank and Gaza) have used targeted killing to kill members of groups such as Al-Qaeda and Hamas.  Legal justifications for targeted killing  The U.S. Army's Law of Land Warfare (Field Manual 27-10) states: > 31\\\\. Assassination and Outlawry It is especially forbidden  to kill or > wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army. > [Article 23(b) of the 1907 Hague Regulations] This article is construed as > prohibiting assassination, proscription, or outlawry of an enemy, or putting > a price upon an enemy's head, as well as offering a reward for an enemy > \\"dead or alive\\". It does not, however, preclude attacks on individual > soldiers or officers of the enemy whether in the zone of hostilities, > occupied territory, or elsewhere. Daniel Reisner, who headed the International Legal Division of the Israeli Military Advocate General's Office from 1994 to 2005, has stated that although targeted killing is illegal under previous understanding of international law, \\"If you do something for long enough, the world will accept it. The whole of international law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries.\\"Consent and advise , Yotam Feldman and Uri Blau, Haaretz, 29 January 2009. Reisner continues, \\"International law progresses through violations. We invented the targeted assassination thesis and we had to push it. At first there were protrusions that made it hard to insert easily into the legal moulds. Eight years later it is in the center of the bounds of legitimacy.\\" This view is disputed by George Bisharat of the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, who contends that assassination is not widely regarded as legal.Why Palestine Should Take Israel to Court in The Hague , George Bisharat, The New York Times, 31 January 2013. Georgetown Law Professor and former U.S. Marine, Gary Solis, has argued that under certain conditions, \\"Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts.\\" For Solis, these conditions require that there is an ongoing military conflict, the targeted individual (civilian or military) has taken up arms, that there is no reasonable possibility of arrest, and that the decision to kill is made by senior political leaders. Abraham Sofaer, a former legal advisor to the U.S. State Department and fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution think tank, has written that targeted killing is \\"sometimes necessary, because leaders are obliged to defend their citizens\\". After the killing of Hamas founder and quadriplegic Ahmed Yassin by Israeli helicopter gunships, Sofaer argued that targeted killing is not prohibited by American Executive Order 11905 banning assassination: \\"killings in self-defense are no more 'assassinations' in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers.\\"\\"Targeted killing is a necessary option\\" , Sofaer, Abraham D., Hoover Institution, 26 March 2004 Sofaer had previously argued during the First Gulf War that targeted killing was ethical but impractical: \\"Targeted killing will also invite revenge against the leaders who order it as well as their citizens and property. Given the legal, political and moral constraints that limit such activities in democratic regimes, the United States has a substantial interest in discouraging acceptance of the killing of political leaders as a routine measure, even in self-defense.\\" Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued, \\"there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing.... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination. Assassination ... constitutes an illegal killing.\\" Amos Guiora, formerly an Israel Defense Forces Lt. Colonol and commander of the IDF school of military law, now Professor of law at the University of Utah, has written, \\"targeted killing is ... not an assassination\\". Steve David, Johns Hopkins Associate Dean & Professor of International Relations, writes: \\"there are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination.\\" Syracuse Law Professor William Banks and GW Law Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write: \\"Targeted killing of terrorists is ... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination.\\" Rory Miller writes: \\"Targeted killing ... is not 'assassination'\\", and associate professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: \\"Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination.\\"\\"Targeted Killing and Assassination: The U.S. Legal Framework\\" , Banks, William C., Raven-Hansen, Peter, 37 University of Richmond Law Review 667 (2002–03). Retrieved 9 October 2010. American defense department analyst and professor Thomas Hunter has defined targeted killing as the \\"premeditated, preemptive, and intentional killing of an individual or individuals known or believed to represent a present or future threat to the safety and security of a state through the affiliation with terrorist groups or individuals. Hunter writes that the target is a person who is allegedly taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has allegedly lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the Third Geneva Convention. Hunter distinguishes between \\"targeted killing\\" and \\"targeted violence\\" as used by specialists who study violence. In response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) stated on 14 September 2001, \\"That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, harbored, committed, or aided in the planning or commission of the attacks against the United States that occurred on 11 September 2001, and to deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States\\". This authorization is still in effect today.The Hill: \\"Obama Could Bomb Iraq Without Congress Because War Authorization Never Expired\\" 12 June 2014. Accessed 17 February 2015. There are no restrictions regarding the physical location of where this law is applied. It only states that the President has the \\"authority to use all necessary and appropriate force\\" this could be interpreted to mean that the President can attack al-Qaeda anywhere in the world.  Legal opposition  During the 1998 bombing of Iraq, The Scotsman reported, \\"US law prohibits the targeted killing of foreign leaders... Administration officials have been careful to say they will not expressly aim to kill Saddam.\\" Frank Sauer and Niklas Schoernig have described targeted killing as a violation of international law and a contravention of domestic laws,Sauer, Frank/Schoernig Niklas, 2012: \\"Killer drones: The 'silver bullet' of democratic warfare?\\" , in: Security Dialogue 43 (4): 363–380, accessed 1 September 2012. and maintain that the term itself is merely a legitimized euphemism for assassination. The American Civil Liberties Union states in its website, \\"A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.\\" Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article \\"By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'\\": > The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and > retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, > lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, > as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished > according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the > abolition of formal legal systems altogether. In 2001, Ibrahim Nafie criticized the U.S. for agreeing with \\"the Israeli spin that calls ... its official policy of assassinating Palestinian leaders 'targeted killing'.\\" In 2013, United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism, Ben Emmerson, stated that U.S. drone strikes may have violated international humanitarian law.\\"Drone strikes by US may violate international law, says UN \\". The Guardian. 18 October 2013.\\"UN report calls for independent investigations of drone attacks \\". The Guardian. 18 October 2013.  Additional concerns  For drone strikes to be effective, the United States must obtain consent from the host country they are operating in. The growing chorus of objections from host countries, most notably emanating from Pakistan, seriously inhibits drones' effectiveness. \\"Host states have grown frustrated with U.S. drone policy, while opposition by non-host partners could impose additional restrictions on the use of drones. Reforming U.S. drone strike policies can do much to allay concerns internationally by ensuring that targeted killings are defensible under international legal regimes that the United States itself helped establish and by allowing U.S. officials to openly address concerns and counter misinformation.\\" Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations believes the United States should \\"end so- called signature strikes, which target unidentified militants based on their behavior patterns and personal networks, and limit targeted killings to a small number of specific terrorists with transnational ambitions. He wants more congressional oversight of drone strikes and stricter regulation on armed drone sales. Finally, he recommends the United States work with international partners to establish rules and norms governing the use of drones. Zenko believes the U.S. government has not been transparent regarding how non- battlefield drone strikes are reconciled with broader foreign policy objectives, the scope of legitimate targets, and their legal framework. While drones may be a critical counterterrorism tool that advances U.S. interests, their \\"lack of transparency threatens to limit U.S. freedom of action and risks proliferation of armed drone technology without the requisite normative framework.\\" Zenko thinks current drone policy might share the same fate of the Bush-era enhanced interrogation techniques and warrantless wiretapping, both of which were unpopular, illegal and ultimately ended. Harvard Law School Professors Gabriella Blum and Philip Heymann cite six potential hazards of targeted killings: First, the so-called Hydra effect, or the rise of more—and more resolute—leaders to replace those who were recently \\"decapitated.\\" Second, drones can drive terrorist leaders into hiding, making the monitoring of their movements, and subsequent intelligence gathering, extremely difficult. Third, \\"the political message flowing from the use of targeted killings may be harmful to the attacking country’s interest, as it emphasizes the disparity in power between the parties and reinforces popular support for the terrorists, who are seen as a David fighting Goliath.\\" Fourth, when conducted in a foreign country, drone strikes run the risk of heightening tensions between the targeting government and the government in whose territory the operation is conducted. Fifth, targeted killings threaten criticism from local domestic constituencies against the government allowing strikes within their country. Finally, there is a danger of over-using targeted killings, both within and outside the war of terrorism. Max Abrahms finds that \\"more than the quantity of violence, decapitation reduces its quality,\\" as leadership vacuums in militant groups are filled by less competent younger members with fewer inhibitions on harming civilians, and that this effect is most pronounced in the immediate aftermath of a successful decapitation strike. Daniel Byman, security studies professor at Georgetown University, argues that Washington must clarify its policies behind extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings, lest a nefarious precedent in international law is set. Additionally, Byman argues that Washington must \\"remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.\\" Though Byman recognizes the problems inherent in using armed UAVs, he believes that they are very effective. \\"U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,000 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban—top figures who are not easily replaced.\\" Drones have also undercut terrorists' ability to effectively communicate with its target audiences, ultimately straining their recruitment pools. To avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda operates have avoided gathering in large numbers and mitigated use of electronic devices. Byman argues that al Qaeda leaders \\"cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire coupe of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda's command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.\\" Audrey Kurth Cronin of George Mason University argues that while drones are tactically savvy, they have failed to advance the strategic goals of U.S. counter-terrorism policy. Terrorism itself is a tactic, Cronin notes, but it succeeds on a strategic plane when a shocking event is successfully leveraged for political gain. \\"To be effective, counter-terrorism must itself respond with a coherent strategy. The problem for Washington today is that its drone program has taken on a life of its own, to the point where tactics are driving strategy rather than the other way around.\\" Cronin agrees with Daniel Byman of Georgetown University insofar that drones have inflicted real damage upon al Qaeda. However, \\"Washington now finds itself in a permanent battle with amorphous and geographically dispersed foe, one with an increasingly marginal connection to the original 9/11 plotters. In this endless contest, the United States risks multiplying its enemies and heightening their incentives to attack the country.\\"  See also  * Targeted Killing in International Law * Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World * Assassination * Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter * CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities * Drone (2014 film) * Executive actions of the CIA * High-value target * Justifiable homicide * Kill authorizations * Killing Hope * Licence to kill (concept) * Manhunt (law enforcement) * Executive Order 12333 * Manhunt (military) * Proscription * Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions  References   Further reading  This list is in chronological order broken down by publication areas ;Monographs * Anna Goppel (2013): Killing Terrorists.

A Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark, the Grand Carousel is Kennywood's third and largest carousel. The music on the carousel is provided by a 1916 Wurlitzer Military Band Organ, Style #153 (one of the oldest Wurlitzer #153's in existence). It is a four-abreast carousel (meaning that it has four rows of animals) and travels in a counter-clockwise direction with over 1,500 lights decorating the ride. The two notable non-equine animals featured on the ride are the tiger and the lion. These two non-equine animals qualify this carousel as a menagerie carousel. It is one of the three rides at Kennywood with a start/stop bell that dates back to the origin of the ride.  Restoration  Both the carousel and band organ were restored in the winter of 1975/76 for the 1976 season.

The roadway of about is a 1930 construction and was the main travel route in the county upon construction until US 71 bypassed this alignment in 1980. History Washington County began to grow with the coming of the railroad in the late nineteenth century. The St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (Frisco) came through the area in the 1870s and communities began forming quickly in the newly accessible area. Influential Fayetteville businessmen persuaded the railroad to come through the city rather than a western alignment through Prairie Grove. Rugby was founded in 1882, renamed Staunton, and would become Greenland by 1909. Improvements came when the wagon road through the area was redesignated as part of the Jefferson Highway. Convict labor combined with a compulsory five days of labor required by law at the time to improve the gravel roadway. Now a route of national importance, the Jefferson Highway was eligible for inclusion in a federal paving program, and bridges were contracted through the state highway commission. The federal designation of US 71 came when Arkansas designated a state highway system in 1926. After construction The route served as the main route between Fort Smith and Fayetteville. The high volume of traffic has caused the entire US 71 routing between Fort Smith and Fayetteville to be bypassed by Interstate 540 (I-540). This segment remains today as a drivable county road, Washington County Route 1194.

Meteorological history A tropical depression which formed in the monsoon trough on May 14 became a tropical storm on May 16 and was named Brenda. Brenda struck Samar Island, then southern Luzon in the Philippines that day. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Bining. After Brenda struck the Philippines, Brenda became a typhoon and reached a peak of winds. After peaking, Brenda made landfall in southern China on May 20. Brenda weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated on the mext day. Preparations and impact Philippines On May 16, storm warnings were issued for 20 provinces across the Philippines as Brenda approached the country. Multiple commercial vessels were kept at port until the storm passed. At least 50 domestic Philippine Airlines flights were canceled and international flights were diverted to airports not in the path of the typhoon. Strong winds produced by Brenda caused widespread disruption from the Visayas through Luzon, downing numerous trees and power lines. Significant power disruption occurred in the Bicol Region as well as the Central Visayas. Three people were killed in Manila after a car was thrown into a bus by strong winds. On May 16, during the filming of Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection, a helicopter crashed roughly 45 km (30 mi) south of Manila, killing five people and injuring four others. The crash was associated with strong winds from Brenda that made flying difficult. Flooding triggered by the storm prompted officials to evacuate over 5,700 people. Rough seas associated with the typhoon were responsible for several incidents across the Philippines. Two people drowned and thirteen others were reported missing after a motor launch capsized roughly 320 km (200 mi) east of Manila. Off the coast of Calavite Island, 23 people went missing after the cargo vessel MV Zambales sank. In Albay Province, the Corazon-II sank while berthed at the Tobaco town pier. Additionally, the five-ton vessel Albert sank off the southern tip of Luzon with five crewmen. The crew reportedly drifted at sea for three days before tying a makeshift raft to a sea turtle which towed them to safety. Throughout the Philippines 13–19 people were killed by the storm while another 40–53 were reported missing. A total of 652 homes were destroyed while another 4,392 were damaged. Losses from the storm amounted to 73 million pesos (US$2.86 million).

For several years the school was associated with the Utah-based World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools. The school was opened as a place to address behavioral issues of young people from across the United States as well as motivate students for success. Its curriculum included a points and level system that rewarded compliance and punished noncompliance. Extremely non-compliant individuals were often kept in solitary confinementby Alexander Ziperovich:] \\"I am one of the \\"non-compliant individuals\\" that was kept in solitary confinement under extreme duress far outside international standards of even the treatment of prisoners of war whilst being constantly threatened with Mexico.

Ziperovich or transferred to a Mexican program known as High Impact, which was later closed by the Mexican Government due to allegations of child abuse. At its peak enrollment, Spring Creek Lodge Academy housed over 500 students and employed about 200 individuals in various positions, making it the largest employer in Sanders County at that time. The school closed in 2009 after an extreme drop in enrollment, several lawsuits, licensing issues, and oversight controversy. In 2010 the Montana-based Academy for National Native Leadership purchased the former Spring Creek facility and began to offer college classes at the school.

She was painting by the age of seventeen and is said to have surpassed many painters of her time. Anna Francisca de Bruyns Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature  Career as an Artist  Anna Francisca de Bruyns, Portrait of Jacques Francart, 1622. At as young as eleven, Anna Francisca de Bruyns was displaying talent and interest in the arts. In March 1616, de Bruyns made a masterly copy of a print of Mamluke horsemen by Jan Swart van Groningen. She also made pen and ink copies of pious prints such as depictions of the Virgin. Once she had acquired a level of skill in drawing she was sent to Brussels to sharpen her skills under the mentorship of her cousin Jacques Francqart. He was very serious with his tutoring and by 1622, at the age of seventeen, de Bruyns made a portrait of Francart on a silver plate. Francart also introduced Anna Francisca to the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, showing her the portrait she made of him. and she was so impressed that Anna was commissioned fifteen small paintings of the Mysteries of the Rosary, which were sent as a gift to Pope Paul V. After marriage, it became much harder for her to find time to paint, but she still managed to.  Family  As mentioned previously, Anna Francisca de Bruyns was born into an upper middle class family and surrounded by court artists. This gave her unusual opportunities to develop her artistic craft. In 1613 her cousin, Jacques Francart, was appointed court painter to the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, and on July 27th, 1622, he became Royal Architect-Engineer to Philip IV of Spain. Anna's father, Cornilla de Bruyns, was bailiff of Morialmé from before she was born until moving to Mons where he became superintendent of the Bergh van Bermherticheyt (translated as public pawnshop) which was an institution founded many years earlier by Wenceslas Cobergher. Cobergher was a leading engineer, architect, painter, and numismatist of the time. Cobergher entered the service of the Archdukes who paid him three times as much as they would Rubens and was included in Anthony va Dyck's Iconography, a series of engraved portraits of the most well-known contemporary intellectuals, noblemen, and artists, which speaks to his prestige. On May 30th 1628 in the Church of Saint-Germain in Mons, Anna married Isaac Bullart--a well-regarded Dutch-born writer--when she was twenty-four years old. They met while Anna was studying under Francart. Bullart actually struggled to win Anna's heart at first, as she was not very social. But he was \\"charmed as much by the beauty of her art as by the loveliness of her face\\" and she eventually consented and her parents approved. They had 12 children,Anna Francisca de Bruyns in the RKD database one being Jacques Ignace Bullart. One year after their marriage she followed him to Arras, where on April 23rd he was named the superintendent of the Mount of Piety. Their first born was born two weeks prior, and was named Wenceslas, after Wenceslas Cobergher, who helped Bullart get his job as superintendent. Sadly, he died in infancy. Bullart studied at the Jesuit College in Bordeaux and spent thirty years collecting material for his Académie des Sciences et des Arts, which contains 279 biographies of scholars and artists and is one of the most important biographical compendia of the seventeenth century. Bullart was even made a Chevalier de l'Ordre de Saint- Michel (Knight of the order of St.Michael) by Anne of Austria, Regent of France for her son Louis XIV in 1647. alt= References * M.

It was formed from the split of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (1996–2002) which was divided into two separate entities: The Department of Sustainability and Environment and The Department of Primary Industries. The department worked with energy companies, research partners, primary producers, mineral explorers and rural communities across Victoria, as well as other State and Federal Government departments, to address the major and emerging challenges in sustainability and productivity. DPI's core services included policy development; regulation and compliance; science, research and development; and sustainable practice change.  Structure  The department was led by a Secretary who is appointed by the Premier of Victoria. DPI supported two Ministerial portfolios, the Minister for Agriculture and Food Security the Hon Peter Walsh and the Minister for Energy and Resources, the Hon Nicholas Kotsiras. The department was structured into five broad groups around its key areas of responsibility: * Energy and Earth Resources Group * Agriculture Research and Development Group * Agriculture and Fisheries Services Group * Policy and Strategy Group * Business and Corporate Services Group The department also oversaw policy on responsible pet ownership in Victoria through its Bureau of Animal Welfare branch Does this Department need investigation if Rosewarne had anything to do with it?

In the early days all efforts were made to repair, renovate and protect premises, vehicles and to do the necessary repairs of the tracks and vehicles. Preservation and repair works started. Archives and some of the exhibition rooms were placed in the station main building. Also the sheds for draisines were converted into exhibition rooms. Sporadic train services began in May 1986. The museum was opened to the public on 6 September 1986. By the end of 1986 the museum had collected 107 vehicles, including 33 steam locomotives. In the 1996 this number reached 253. In 2009 the total number of all types of rolling stock was 263, including 56 steam locomotives. After scrapping and selling several units this number fell to 228 in 2011. Some of the vehicles still need substantial restoration before moving from storage to display. In the late 1980s the tracks were repaired, mainly sleepers replacements but also two bridges were fixed.

Flowers are medium size, full, (26–40 petals), cup shaped, and globular. The small round bush, has foliage that is bright green, and glossy. The bush grows in height of 26\\" to 31\\" (65 to 80 cm), with a spread of 20\\" to 26\\" (50 to 65 cm). It could grow larger in warmer climates. Usually climates with warmer temperatures offer the roses a longer season, thus allowing them to get much larger than they would in a shorter season. The bright green foliage makes a nice backdrop for the buttery yellow flowers. It is used in borders, garden beds, containers, and as a cut flower. It is a popular landscaping plant, because of its bright yellow color, disease resistance, and constant bloom. The Julia Child rose is heat tolerant, with excellent resistance to blackspot and mildew. It is hardy (USDA zone 4a through 10a). Free-flowering, the rose is known for its old-fashioned form and sweet licorice fragrance. Removing faded blooms (deadheading) forces the plant to produce more flowers. Only minimal pruning is needed to maintain its shape.\\"Julia Child Rose Bush\\", All About Rose Gardening.

Early investigations at the site began in 1966 by Harold Huscher, which led to a larger excavation in June 1967, and again in 1968. According to Huscher, the Avery Site is most definitely related to the Georgia Fall Line sites. The site once had two platform mounds, the Avery Mound, the northernmost of the two, was eroded by cultivation and weathering, however enough remained to give evidence to multiple periods of mound rebuilding. to the south was the Potts Mound, yet while it was bulldozed for field leveling there was still outlining evidence of the mounds former existence. Surrounding the two mounds was a large village area, dispersed with various pottery remains that point to a late Lamar Phase component and even a possible unidentified Mississippian component. A palisade line was found running along one side of the Avery Mound which exhibits a carefully constructed fortification structure. A curvilinear line of post- holes was discovered surrounding a charcoal-like core mound inside the Avery Mound. Additionally, a large burned rectangular building, with evidence of an octagonal roofing frame, was found at the north margin of the Avery Mound. This was the extent of the excavation done at the Avery Site, even though Huscher believed more should be done on the charcoal-like core mound and palisade.

Early life Born on 22 July 1894 at Hunters Hill in Sydney to English immigrants, Brown attended Sydney Grammar School and then Bathurst Experimental Farm before becoming a jackeroo at Condobolin. He later became an overseer at Cobar. He moved to Western Australia in 1914. Military career First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Brown enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 5 March 1915. He was posted as a sergeant in the 28th Battalion and was sent to Gallipoli. Arriving in September, he remained on the peninsula until evacuation in December. On 12 February 1916 he was commissioned in Egypt, and in March was sent with the battalion to France. He was awarded the Military Cross following his actions at the Battle of Pozières and was promoted captain in September 1916. In November 1916 Brown was shot through the neck at Flers. After receiving treatment in England, he returned to his battalion in January 1917. In April, he was promoted temporary major. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions during the Battle of Bullecourt in May. He was wounded again in September, requiring hospitalisation but returned to the field in February 1918. In April 1919 he returned to Australia and was subsequently discharged from the AIF. Interwar period Returning to civilian life, Brown married Freda Mary Thompson in Sydney on 6 January 1920. As part of the soldier settlement program he began farming near Coonabarabran. He was active in the local community, becoming vice-president of the Coonabarabran sub- branch of the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, president of the local Sane Democracy League and a local commander of the New Guard. He contested the 1931 federal election as a Country Party candidate for Gwydir, but was defeated by a second Country candidate, Aubrey Abbott. He was one of the foundation members of the National Defence League of Australia in 1938 (he would later become president of its central council). Second World War After the Second World War broke out, Brown rejoined the AIF and was sent to the Middle East with the 2nd/1st Pioneer Battalion. On 9 March 1941 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and he commanded the battalion during its part in the defence of Tobruk. Mentioned in despatches and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1942, he was appointed commander of the 36th Battalion, then serving in Papua. He serving in this role from May to September, before becoming commander of his previous battalion, now serving in New Guinea. However, his time in this latter command was limited as he became ill and was hospitalised intermittently for five months until March 1943. Upon his recovery, Brown held administrative positions for the rest of the war in New Guinea, Melbourne, Queensland and Singapore. Following the end of the war he presided over the trials of Japanese war criminals in Darwin, where his leniency caused some controversy. Later life Following the end of his service with the AIF on 29 August 1946, Brown took up a farm near Windsor but poor health intervened. His final public position was director of the Immigration Holding Centre at Scheyville in 1949. In 1958 he was classified as totally and permanently incapacitated due to his war service. He died at Batemans Bay in 1960 of ischaemic heart disease, survived by his wife and three children. A son had been killed in service with the AIF during the Second World War.

The company is the only operator that remained private, even after the creation of Telebrás in the military regime, and it is characterized as the fifth largest company in the telecommunications segment. It serves more than one million and four hundred thousand customers - individuals, micro and small businesses, corporate customers, and carriers. History Algar Telecom, headquartered in Uberlândia - State of Minas Gerais, is one of the companies of Grupo Algar and was founded with the name CTBC - Companhia de Telecomunicações do Brasil Central on February 15, 1954, by Alexandrino Garcia, who acquired Companhia Telefônica Teixeirinha. Alexandrino was 47 years old when he started the business in the telephony industry and began, at the time, to personally sell the services of the company. Initially, the company worked with a focus on the countryside, in the well-known \\"Central Brazil,\\" covering part of the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo. Later, it started to cover the region of Alta Mogiana, in São Paulo, the east of Mato Grosso do Sul, the region of Triângulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaíba - Minas Gerais - and the southern region of the state of Goiás. Its area of operation includes the main capitals of Brazil and their surroundings, including São Paulo, Campinas, Ribeirão Preto, São José do Rio Preto, Goiânia, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Uberlândia, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Balneário Camboriú, Florianópolis, and Porto Alegre, among others. In 2007, the company made a public issue of debentures and became a publicly-traded company, not listed on stock exchanges. In 2010, it was granted a license to operate in the H Band, the last one available for 3G telephony. It may operate in the regions with DDDs (area codes) 34, 35 and 37. In cities such as Divinópolis, Itaúna, Araxá, Bom Despacho, Claudio, Poços de Caldas, and Itajubá, increasing its coverage area from 87 cities to 233. In 2013, the operator has completed the strategic branding cycle of Grupo Algar (in 2009, Grupo Algar decided for a single-brand strategy, that is, all its businesses would have Algar as a name) with the evolution of its retail brand and the permanent replacement of the name CTBC by Algar Telecom. In 2014, Algar Telecom won the frequency batch 5 of the 4G auction, in the range of 700 megahertz (MHz). The frequency awarded at the auction, organized by Anatel, has regional coverage and corresponds to the company's concession area, with a capacity of 10+10 MHz. Also in 2014, Algar Telecom communicated to the market the signing of an agreement with Angola Cables, Antel, and Google, in order to start the construction of a new optic fiber submarine cable that will connect Brazil to the United States. The cable will come out from Santos (SP), pass through Fortaleza (CE), and will arrive in the city of Boca Raton (Florida, USA). At the beginning of 2015, Algar Telecom selected Nokia Networks in order to launch its LTE services in the 700 MHz band and in order to modernize its 3G network – preparing the groundwork for the introduction of HD voice services in 2016. Nokia Networks signed a 5-year contract as the only supplier of Algar Telecom, in order to deliver and manage radio and core solutions, transforming the carrier's network infrastructure. In 2015, the company also acquired Optitel, an IT and Telecommunication company based in Balneário Camboriú (state of Santa Catarina), strengthening its operations and expansion in the southern region of the country. In December 2017, Grupo Algar announced the sale of 25% of its stake in Algar Telecom to the investment fund Archy, which is a subsidiary of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited. The sale is currently pending regulatory approval by Brazil's federal telecommunications regulatory agency Anatel as well as the Brazilian government's competition regulator CADE.http://www.telesintese.com.br/fundo-de-cingapura-compra-25-das-acoes-da- algar-telecom/https://g1.globo.com/mg/triangulo-mineiro/noticia/algar-telecom- fundada-em-uberlandia-vende-25-do-capital-para-fundo-soberano-de- cingapura.ghtml  Coverage Area  Algar Telecom is nowadays present in the main regions of Brazil, with 31,000 kilometers of optic fiber serving its 1.3 million clients in the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, and the Federal District as well.

A British citizen living in Canada when the war began, he returned home for service. After being assigned to the Royal Flying Corps, he was credited with eight aerial victories. He died while rescuing a fellow pilot from a crashed aircraft. Early life James Martin Child, son of Constance Octavio and Tylney Harris Child of Leytonstone, England, was born on 20 October 1893. The youthful Child moved to Canada, worked in a bank, and was a prospector for minerals. He was still in Canada when the First World War started. World War I Child was a Canadian militia member; however, somehow he couldn't return to England with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, so he paid his own passage home to England. Once there, he was commissioned into the Durham Light Infantry. He then transferred to the Manchester Regiment. He was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in the first half of 1916. He first served in No. 4 Squadron, but was posted to No. 19 Squadron in July 1916 as a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12 pilot. He scored his first victory on 23 April 1917. On 12 May 1917, Second Lieutenant Child, who was already serving as a temporary lieutenant, was appointed a temporary captain for service as a Flight Commander. He was also Mentioned in Despatches. He scored three victories in all while flying Spad VIIs during April, May and June 1917 before he was removed from combat. Subsequently, on 28 September 1917, the King of Belgium invested him as a Chevalier in the Order of Leopold II. He returned to combat as a flight commander in No. 84 Squadron and tallied five more victories during October and November 1917 while piloting Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a serial number B562. Once again relieved from combat duty, he returned to England in February 1918, detailed as an instructor. On 15 March 1918, he was awarded the Belgian War Cross. It was followed by the Military Cross, gazetted on 5 July 1918: > Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) James Martin Child, Manchester Regiment and > Royal Flying Corps For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While > leading a patrol he encountered four enemy scouts, one of which he > destroyed.

The program was originally specifically tailored for at risk children and parents, but there are now different levels of Triple P designed to work together as a broad, universal, public health approach. This program is based on principles of community psychology.  History  Triple P, or the \\"Positive Parenting Program\\", was created by Matthew R. Sanders and colleagues, in 2001. at the University of Queensland in Australia and evolved from a small “home-based, individually administered training program for parents of disruptive preschool children” into a comprehensive preventive intervention program (p. 506). This program was inspired by health promotion programs aimed at impacting people at the population level. The overall goal of the program is to enhance the knowledge, skills, and confidence of parents in order to prevent behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems in children and adolescents.  Program elements   Overview  There are five developmental periods that are targeted from infancy to adolescence. At each developmental period, the range of the program can be either broad and target the entire population or it can be specific and target only at-risk children. The program addresses social contexts that influence parents’ daily life: mass media, primary health care services, child care and school systems, work sites, religious organizations, and the broader political system (p. 507). The multilevel nature of the program is designed to increase efficiency, minimize costs, and ensure dissemination. The design also maximizes usage of existing community resources.  Specific goals  * Promoting self- sufficiency of parents so that they may feel confident in their abilities to parent with minimal or no additional support. * Increase parental self- efficacy so that the parent believes he or she can overcome a problem in parenting when it arises. * Use self-management tools so that parents may change parenting practices for the better. This involves self-assessment of performance, setting goals, and choosing child management techniques. * Promoting personal agency meaning that parents must learn to “own” the improvements in their family situation. * Promoting problem solving so that parents can learn how to \\"define problems, formulate opinions, develop a parenting plan, execute the plan, evaluate the outcome, and revise the plan as required\\" (p. 507).  Principles of positive parenting  # Safe and Engaging Environment #:A protective environment that is safe, supervised, and provides opportunities to explore, play, and learn promotes healthy child development at all ages. #Positive Learning Environment #:This principle involves teaching parents to be their children's first teacher. This means that parents must learn to respond to their children's requests in a positive and constructive manner while also helping them learn to solve problems on their own. #Assertive Discipline #:The program teaches parents how to change from using ineffective and coercive discipline such as physical punishment, shouting, and threatening to using effective strategies in specific situations. Effective strategies include selecting ground rules for specific situations, discussing rules with children, giving clear, calm, and age- appropriate directions and requests, presenting logical consequences, using quiet time and time out, and using planned ignoring (p. 509). #Realistic Expectations #:This helps parents change expectations and goals for child behavior to be developmentally appropriate for the child and realistic for the parent. Parents who have more realistic expectations of this child's capabilities are less likely to engage in child abuse or child neglect. #Parental Self-Care #:This principle aims at teaching parents practical skills so that they may view parenting as part of a larger context related to self- care, resourcefulness, and well-being and maintain a sense of self-esteem.  Programs  In addition to the program for younger children (Standard Triple PSanders M R, Markie-Dadds, Turner K M T. Practitioner Manual for Standard Triple P. 2nd ed. Brisbane, Australia: Triple P International; 2012.), there are versions of Triple P for families with specific needs, including parents of adolescents (Teen Triple PRalph A, Sanders M R.

Brisbane, QLD, Australia: Triple P International.  Research  Evidence for the effectiveness of intervention programs can be divided into two types. One type is impact studies where the aim of the evaluation is to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in outcomes on a population, which can be attributed to the intervention. A second type is qualitative studies which aim to illuminate the mechanisms through which program participants can access the resources and help offered in the program to achieve better outcomes. Nowak and Heinrichs (2008) conducted a meta-analysis that analyzed findings of 55 research studies on the Positive Parenting Program and found reliable positive effects of the program across all settings (initial levels of problems and countries) for child behavior problems, parenting behavior, and parental well-being. Parents’ relationship quality also significantly improved as a result of the program. The findings were unable to establish whether positive child effects were due to an increase in positive behavior or a decrease in problematic behavior. According to the authors, the results of the meta-analysis indicated the program's “ability to effect meaningful improvements in parents and children” (p. 114). Furthermore, Triple P has also been provided to families in the United Kingdom where neglect is a concern. The findings from this service showed that, on average the children who participated in the evaluation experienced improved emotional and behavioural outcomes. However this positive change could not be attributed to Triple P because a control group had not been established.Whalley, P. (2015) Child neglect and Pathways Triple P: An Evaluation of an NSPCC services offered to parents where initial concerns of neglect have been noted, https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/pathways- triple-p-evaluation-report.pdf A critical 2012 systematic review and meta- analysis of these interventions revealed many small, underpowered and poorly- controlled studies, with substantial risk of reporting bias, triggering a response from a group including many Triple-P authors. Another commentary in the same journal claimed the response did not adequately address the critique and indicated that commitments to such programmes by policy-makers needs to be based on sound evidence, or risks wasting money. A later meta-analysis by a group including Triple-P authors was published in 2014 claiming widespread benefits in the short and long term. Qualitative research studies have also illuminated some of the ways in which programs can help individual parents. An evaluation of the Triple P intervention highlighted how many parents were able to improve the way in which they related to their children after having received advice about how to be clear and boundaries with their children, and in some cases after having tried and seen the effects of such approaches for themselves, first-hand, and often for the first time.

He attended boarding school and, despite taking the University of Cambridge entrance examination, became an apprentice to an engineer. He worked for the Metropolitan Railways in London during World War I and became politically radicalised by the 1917 Russian Revolution. In 1924 Tripp moved to Western Australia and then to Townsville, where he worked on the government railways and joined the Australian Workers' Union and the Communist Party of Australia. In 1929 he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as an Independent Communist candidate for Mundingburra. He visited Britain, Germany and Moscow later in 1929 and leaned towards Trotskyism, returning to Australia by mid-1930. In 1931 Tripp was a candidate for the 1931 by-election for the House of Representatives seat of Parkes, making him the first endorsed Communist to stand for federal parliament. At the federal election later that year he contested Darling and in 1932 ran for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of King. Despite being president of the Friends of the Soviet Union from 1930 to 1933, he lost favour with the Communist Party and was expelled in 1934, joining the Sydney Trotskyists, a local branch of the Workers' Party of Australia. He became secretary of the Workers' Party in 1935 and edited the organisations journal, the Militant. He fell out with his new party in 1937 and led the League for Revolutionary Democracy (Independent Communist League), a rival group. Tripp moved to Melbourne in 1938 and on 30 July married Ruby May Bullock at Carlton.

He seems to have been a son of Dubgall mac Somairle, King of the Isles, and therefore a member of the Meic Dubgaill branch of the Meic Somairle kindred. Óspakr spent a considerable portion of his career in the Kingdom of Norway as a member of the Birkibeinar faction in the Civil war era in Norway. He seems to be identical to Óspakr suðreyski, a Birkibeinar who took part in the plundering of Hebrides and the sacking of Iona in 1209/1210. The context of this expedition is uncertain, although it may have been envisioned as a way of reasserting Norwegian royal authority into the Kingdom of the Isles. In the decade following the ravaging of Iona, the Kingdom of the Isles was plagued by vicious conflict between two competing dynasts of the Crovan dynasty. Although one member of this kindred, Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles, overcame his main dynastic rival in 1229, he faced continued opposition from Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway, and leading members of the Meic Somairle. In consequence of this conflict, Óláfr fled to Norway in 1230, and Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway authorised the preparation of a military campaign to restore order. The title of king was thereupon conferred upon Óspakr, as was the royal name Hákon, with Óspakr receiving command of a fleet take with him into the Isles. By May or June of that year, Óspakr's fleet reached the heart of the Hebrides where it is recorded to have swollen to eighty ships. The full brunt of Óspakr's forces were directed at Bute, where a stronghold—almost certainly Rothesay Castle—is reported to have fallen within a few days. Reports of a nearby fleet under Alan's command forced the Norwegians to withdraw from Bute, and Óspakr is reported to have died, apparently from injuries sustained during the sack of Bute. After Óspakr's death, the Norwegian enterprise was led by Óláfr who established himself on Mann. The following spring, with the Kingdom of the Isles partitioned between Óláfr and his rival nephew, Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson, the Norwegians set sail for home, where Hákon thanked the returning warriors. About thirty years later, a certain Ruðri is recorded to have claimed Bute as his birthright, and to have assisted Hákon in another Norwegian campaign in the Isles. One possibility is that Ruðri was a descendant of Óspakr. Familial background Locations relating to Óspakr's life and times. Óspakr seems to have been a member of the Meic Dubgaill branch of the Meic Somairle kindred. Specifically, Óspakr appears to have been a son of Dubgall mac Somairle, King of the Isles,Beuermann (2010) p. 107 n. 25; McDonald (2007b) p. 27 tab. 2; Power (2005) p. 33; Tabraham (2005) pp. 26, 30; Brown (2004) p. 77 tab. 4.1; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii; McDonald (1997) p. 257; Rixson (1982) p. 14 fig. 1; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) pp. 196–197. ancestor of the Meic Dubgaill.Beuermann (2010) p. 108 n. 28. The latter figure was a son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles,Beuermann (2010) p. 107 n. 25; McDonald (2007b) p. 27 tab. 2; Power (2005) p. 33; Brown (2004) p. 77 tab. 4.1; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii; McDonald (1997) p. 257; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) pp. 196–197. the common ancestor of the Meic Somairle.McDonald (2007b) p. 111; Broun (2005) p. 95; Woolf (2005). Óspakr's name—although Scandinavian—is not evidence against a familial connection with the Meic Somairle, as Somairle himself bore a Gaelicised form of a Scandinavian name.McDonald (1997) p. 89; Cowan (1990) p. 114. Nevertheless, there is also a possibility that Óspakr's name is a Scandinavianised form of the Gaelic .Beuermann (2010) p. 107, 107 n. 25; McDonald (2007b) p. 158 n. 69; Tabraham (2005) p. 26; Sellar (2000) p. 202; Fellows-Jensen (1998) p. 27; McDonald (1997) p. 89; Duncan (1996) p. 547; Fellows-Jensen (1993) p. 405; Oram (1988) p. 138; Barrow (1981) p. 110. Although the patronym—\\"\\"—accorded to Óspakr by the thirteenth- to fourteenth- century Chronicle of Mann ostensibly identifies his father as a man named Ǫgmundr,Sellar (2000) p. 202; McDonald (1997) p. 89; Anderson (1922) p. 472, 472 n. 3; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 92–93. the thirteenth-century Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar instead identifies Óspakr as a son of Dubgall mac Somairle.McDonald (1997) p. 89; Anderson (1922) pp. 464–465; Jónsson (1916) p. 555 ch. 165; Kjær (1910) p. 462 ch. 178/163; Dasent (1894) p. 150 ch. 163; Vigfusson (1887) p. 144 ch. 163; Unger (1871) p. 476 ch. 169; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 100 ch. 136. If the latter source is indeed correct, one possibility is that the patronym recorded by the Chronicle of Mann refers to a foster father rather than a biological father.Sellar (2000) p. 202. On the other hand, there is reason to suspect that Óspakr's patronym indeed refers to a biological ancestor.Barrow (1981) p. 110. For example, the patronym accorded to Somairle by the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster—\\"\\"—refers Somairle's grandfather, Gilla Adamnáin, instead of Somairle's father, Gilla Brigte.The Annals of Ulster (2017) § 1164.4; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1164.4; Woolf (2005); Barrow (1981) p. 108 n. 2; Sellar (1966) p. 129. The fact that Somairle is accorded a patronym referring to his lineage rather than his parentage could indicate that Óspakr's patronym is a Scandinavianised form of the same lineage name. Plunderer of Iona Óspakr suðreyski's name as it appears on folio 138v of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 468 ch. 18; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). Óspakr suðreyski's epithet, , translates to \\"the Hebridean\\".Michaelsson (2015) p. 30 n. 124. Óspakr seems to be identifical to Óspakr suðreyski, a like-named member of an invading Norwegian force that plundered Iona in 1210.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Beuermann (2010) p. 107 n. 25; Power (2005) pp. 39, 44; McGrail (1995) p. 39. According to the Icelandic annals, a military expedition from Norway into the Isles had been under preparation in 1209. The following year, this source makes note of \\"warfare\\" in the Isles, and reveals that Iona was pillaged.McDonald (2012) p. 163; McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Oram (2005) p. 8; Power (2005) p. 38; Oram (2000) p. 115; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 143; Storm (1977) p. 123; Anderson (1922) pp. 378, 381–382; Vigfusson (1878) pp. 366–367; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 523. These reports are corroborated by the thirteenth-century Bǫglunga sǫgur, a saga-collection that survives in two versions. Both versions reveal that a fleet of Norwegians plundered in the Isles, and the shorter version notes how men of the Birkibeinar and the Baglar—two competing sides of the Norwegian civil war—decided to recoup their financial losses with a twelve-ship raiding expedition into the Isles. This particular version of the saga names Óspakr suðreyski as one of the three Birkibeinar leaders of the expedition.Michaelsson (2015) p. 30 ch. 17; Beuermann (2012) pp. 1, 7; McDonald (2012) p. 163; Oram (2013) ch. 4; McDonald (2008) pp. 142–143; McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Oram (2005) p. 8; Power (2005) p. 38; Beuermann (2002) p. 420 n. 6; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 143; Oram (2000) p. 115; Anderson (1922) pp. 378–381, 379 n. 2; Jónsson (1916) p. 468 ch. 18; Fornmanna Sögur (1835) pp. 192–195. rook gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Strickland (2012) p. 113 fig. 3.3; Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6c, 184 fig. 11, 189 fig. 16. The Scandinavian connections of leading members of the Isles may have been reflected in their military armament, and could have resembled that depicted upon such gaming pieces.Strickland (2012) p. 113. One possibility is that this operation was organised in the context of the Norwegian Crown reasserting royal authority in the Isles.Beuermann (2011) p. 125; McDonald (2008) pp. 142–144; McDonald (2007b) pp. 133–137; Johnsen (1969) p. 33. For example, the longer version of the saga relates that a fleet of Norwegians made landfall in Shetland and Orkney, whereupon Bjarni Kolbeinsson, Bishop of Orkney, and the two co-earls of Orkney—Jón Haraldsson and Davið Haraldsson—were compelled to journey to Norway and submit to Ingi Bárðarson, King of Norway, rendering him hostages and a large fine.Crawford (2014) pp. 72–73; Beuermann (2012) p. 8; Beuermann (2011) p. 125; McDonald (2008) pp. 142–143; McDonald (2007b) pp. 133–134; Oram (2005) p. 8; Williams (1997) p. 114; Anderson (1922) pp. 380–381; Fornmanna Sögur (1835) pp. 192–195. The same source further reveals that, as a consequence of the Norwegian plundering in the Isles, two members of the ruling Crovan dynasty—Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles and his son Guðrøðr—also travelled to Norway, where they swore obedience to Ingi, paid him a tax, and took their lands from him as a (fief).Crawford (2014) pp. 72–73; Beuermann (2012) p. 7; McDonald (2012) p. 163; Beuermann (2011) p. 125; Beuermann (2010) pp. 106–107, 106 n. 19; McDonald (2008) pp. 142–143, 143 n. 63; McDonald (2007b) p. 134; Brown (2004) p. 74; Williams (1997) pp. 114–115; Johnsen (1969) p. 23, 23 n. 3; Anderson (1922) p. 381, 381 nn. 1–2; Fornmanna Sögur (1835) pp. 194–195. The submission of the Islesmen seems to have been undertaken at about the time of a reawakening of Norwegian royal authority following the settlement between the opposing Birkibeinar and Baglar factions.Beuermann (2010) p. 106; McDonald (2008) p. 142; McDonald (2007b) pp. 134–135. There is reason to suspect that the destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment in response to not only Rǫgnvaldr's recalcitrance of his Norwegian obligations, but his recent reorientation towards the English Crown.McDonald (2007b) p. 135. In any case, the fact that Ingi turned his attention to the Isles so soon after peace was brokered between the Birkibeinar and Baglar may well indicate the importance he placed on his relations with his contemporaries in the Isles.Beuermann (2011) p. 125.

Within the same year of the attack, the Icelandic annals state that a certain Koli was consecrated Bishop of the Isles.Beuermann (2012) p. 7; Woolf (2003) p. 177; Beuermann (2002) p. 420 n. 6; Anderson (1922) pp. 381–382; Storm (1977) p. 123 § iv; Vigfusson (1878) pp. 366–367; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 523. This record could reveal that Koli's consecration was somehow related to the Norwegian expedition of 1209/1210,Beuermann (2012) pp. 7–8; Anderson (1922) pp. 381–382 n. 4. and that—just as the Orcadian earls were accompanied to Norway by their bishop—Rǫgnvaldr and Guðrøðr may have been accompanied by Koli.Beuermann (2012) pp. 7–8. The Norwegian undertaking, therefore, may have been designed to reassert Norwegian overlordship over both secular and ecclesiastical authorities in Norwegian satellites overseas. If correct, the voyage would seem to have been orchestrated by both Ingi and his chief prelate, Þórir Guðmundarson, Archbishop of Niðaróss. Although the leadership of the Meic Somairle had controversially refounded Iona at the turn of the century, and had further secured its independence from the Diocese of the Isles by placing it under the protection of the papacy, the Norwegian sack of the island may not have been a sanctioned act. One possibility is that a visit to the island by the Norwegian delegation disastrously deteriorated into otherwise unplanned violence.Beuermann (2012). King of the Isles Donnchad, sons of Dubgall mac Somairle and possible brothers of Óspakr, as they appear on folio 162v of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 555 ch. 165; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). The epithet attributed to Dubgall in this excerpt, , translates to \\"screech\\".Anderson (1922) p. 465. In the decades following the ravaging of Iona, the Kingdom of the Isles was plagued by vicious conflict between two competing dynasts of the Crovan dynasty: namely Rǫgnvaldr and his younger half-brother, Óláfr Guðrøðarson. Although Rǫgnvaldr enlisted the support of Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway by way of a marital alliance,McNamee (2005); Duffy (2004). Óláfr seized the kingship of the Isles in 1226, and slew Rǫgnvaldr three years later.Brown (2004) p. 78; McNamee (2005); Duffy (2004). The death of Alan's ally did not deter Gallovidian interests in the Isles. In fact, it is apparent that Alan and members of the Meic Somairle—Dubgall and Donnchad, both sons of Dubgall mac Somairle—upheld pressure upon the recently inaugurated Óláfr.Oram (2011) p. 192; McDonald (1997) p. 89; Oram (2000) p. 128; Cowan (1990) p. 115; Oram (1988) p. 138; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201. According to Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, reports of open warfare in the Isles reached the royal court of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway in the summer of 1229.McDonald (2019) p. 68; Oram (2013) ch. 4; Power (2005) p. 44; Stringer (1998) p. 97; McDonald (1997) p. 88; Oram (1988) p. 138; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 200; Anderson (1922) p. 464, 464 n. 4; Jónsson (1916) p. 555 ch. 164; Kjær (1910) p. 461 ch. 177/162; Dasent (1894) p. 150 ch. 162; Vigfusson (1887) p. 144 ch. 162; Unger (1871) p. 475 ch. 168; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 100 ch. 135. Specifically, the saga singles out Alan as one of the principal perpetrators of unrest in the Isles, describing him as \\"the greatest warrior\\", possessing a large force of men and ships with which he plundered throughout the Hebrides.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Strickland (2012) p. 104; Carpenter (2003) ch. 10 ¶ 63; Oram (2000) p. 128; Oram (1988) p. 138; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201; Anderson (1922) p. 464, 464 n. 4; Jónsson (1916) p. 555 ch. 165; Kjær (1910) p. 462 ch. 178/163; Dasent (1894) p. 150 ch. 163; Vigfusson (1887) p. 144 ch. 163; Unger (1871) pp. 475–476 ch. 169; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 100 ch. 136. The two sons of Dubgall mac Somairle are also noted, as is a kinsman of theirs named Somairle. All three of these Meic Somairle kinsmen are styled kings by Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, which describes the men as \\"unfaithful\\" to the Norwegian Crown. The saga also identifies Óspakr as yet another son of Dubgall mac Somairle, albeit one who was had long served outwith the Isles as a Birkibeinar.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Power (2005) pp. 44–45; Brown (2004) p. 78; McDonald (1997) p. 89; Cowan (1990) p. 114; Johnsen (1969) p. 26; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) pp. 200–202; Anderson (1922) pp. 464–465; Jónsson (1916) p. 555 ch. 165; Kjær (1910) p. 462 ch. 178/163; Dasent (1894) p. 150 ch. 163; Vigfusson (1887) p. 144 ch. 163; Unger (1871) p. 476 ch. 169; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 100 ch. 136. Although Óláfr arrived at the Norwegian court early in 1230, having been forced from the Isles by Alan and his allies, it is evident that Hákon had already decided upon a course of action.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2011) p. 192; McNamee (2005); Power (2005) p. 44; Oram (2000) p. 128; McDonald (1997) p. 89; Oram (1988) p. 138.

The Icelandic annals, the Chronicle of Mann, the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost, and Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, all reveal that Hákon handed over the kingship of the Isles to Óspakr and bestowed upon him the royal name Hákon.McDonald (2019) p. 68; McDonald (1997) pp. 89–90; Storm (1977) pp. 24 § i, 64 § iii, 128 § iv, 187 § v, 327 § viii; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201; Anderson (1922) pp. 471–473; Jónsson (1916) p. 556 ch. 167; Kjær (1910) p. 463 ch. 180/165; Dasent (1894) p. 151 ch. 164; Vigfusson (1887) p. 145 ch. 165; Vigfusson (1878) p. 371; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 92–93; Unger (1871) p. 476 ch. 171; Flateyjarbok (1868) pp. 101 ch. 137, 527; Stevenson (1839) p. 41. According to the latter source, Hákon not only granted him the kingship, but also gave him command of the Norwegian fleet tasked with restoring peace in the Isles.Oram (2000) p. 128; McDonald (1997) pp. 89–90; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) pp. 200–201; Anderson (1922) pp. 473–474; Jónsson (1916) p. 556 ch. 167; Kjær (1910) p. 463 ch. 180/165; Dasent (1894) p. 151 ch. 164; Vigfusson (1887) p. 145 ch. 165; Unger (1871) p. 476 ch. 171; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 101 ch. 137. Within days of Óláfr's arrival in Norway, the saga reveals that Óspakr's fleet set sail for the Isles, and swelled in number after reaching Orkney.Murray (2005) p. 293; Oram (2005) p. 40; Oram (2000) p. 128; Williams (1997) p. 117; Johnsen (1969) p. 26; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201; Anderson (1922) p. 474, 474 n. 2, 474 n. 9; Jónsson (1916) p. 556 ch. 168; Kjær (1910) p. 464 ch. 181/166; Dasent (1894) p. 152 ch. 166; Vigfusson (1887) p. 146 ch. 166; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 172; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 101 ch. 138. Whilst the Eirspennill version of the saga numbers the fleet in Norway at twelve ships, the Flateyjarbók, Frísbók, and Skálholtsbók versions give the number eleven;Anderson (1922) p. 474, 474 n. 2; Jónsson (1916) p. 556 ch. 168; Kjær (1910) p. 464 ch. 181/166; Dasent (1894) p. 152 ch. 166; Vigfusson (1887) p. 146 ch. 166; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 172; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 101 ch. 138. and whilst the former version relates that the fleet gained twenty ships from Orkney, the latter three versions state that the fleet numbered twenty when it left Orkney.Anderson (1922) p. 474, 474 n. 9; Jónsson (1916) p. 556 ch. 168; Kjær (1910) p. 464 ch. 181/166; Dasent (1894) p. 152 ch. 166; Vigfusson (1887) p. 146 ch. 166; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 172; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 101 ch. 138. Once in the Isles, the fleet linked up with the three other members of the Meic Somairle on Islay. According to the saga, the Meic Somairle held a feast for the Norwegians. That night, whilst Donnchad slept on board with Óspakr, the Norwegians are stated to have attacked Dubgall and Somairle, killing the latter amongst many others. Once Óspakr became aware of the attack, the source states that he allowed Donnchad to escape, and took Dubgall under his protection.Murray (2005) p. 293; McDonald (1997) p. 90; Cowan (1990) pp. 114–115; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201; Anderson (1922) p. 475; Jónsson (1916) p. 557 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 465 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) pp. 152–153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 146–147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. One possibility is that Donnchad's escape was enabled as in an attempt to retain the Meic Dubgaill's dual allegiance to the Norwegian and Scottish Crowns. Another possibility is that Óspakr's Meic Somairle kinsmen were suspected of attempting to sabotage the operation. Certainly, Donnchad's later career reveals him to have ingratiated himself to the Scottish cause.Murray (2005) pp. 294–295. The name of Somairle, possibly Óspakr's brother, as it appears on folio 163r of AM 47 fol: \\"\\". There are two conspicuous Meic Somairle absentees from Óspakr's campaign. One such man was Ruaidrí mac Ragnaill, who seems to have been driven from Kintyre by Alexander II, King of Scotland in the 1220s. One explanation for Ruaidrí's nonappearance may be his possible participation in the near-concurrent insurrection of the Meic Uilleim claimants to the Scottish throne.Woolf (2007) pp. 82–83; Murray (2005) pp. 295–296. Ruaidrí's younger brother, Domnall, is likewise unattested, although this may have been due to the fact that he seems to have come to an accommodation with the Scottish king in the wake of Ruaidrí's expulsion, and to have owed his lordship in Kintyre to Alexander's good will.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Murray (2005) pp. 296–297. If correct, the Norwegian muster off Islay, and the ravaging of surrounding territories, may be indicative of an attempt by Óspakr to overawe Domnall. Ruinous Rothesay Castle. According to saga accounts, Óspakr's forces attacked the castle's soft stone walls, whilst the Scots poured boiling pitch down upon them.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 251–252; Stell (2000) p. 277; Pringle (1998) p. 152; McGrail (1995) pp. 39–40; Anderson (1922) p. 476, 476 n. 5; Jónsson (1916) p. 557 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 465 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. Later in the century, the castle appears to have undergone considerable reconstructional enhancement.Stell (2000) p. 278; McGrail (1995) p. 41. News of the gathering Norwegian fleet soon reached Alexander II, who appears to have made straight for the western coast, diverting his attention to the now rapidly developing crisis. On 28 May, Alan is recorded in Alexander II's presence at Ayr, where the Scottish royal forces appear to have assembled.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2011) p. 192; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 250; Brown (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 129; Stringer (1998) p. 97; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) pp. 47–48; Document 1/7/164 (1832). It was probably May or June when Óspakr's fleet rounded the Mull of Kintyre, entered the Firth of Clyde, and made landfall on Bute, where his forces successfully stormed and captured a fortress that is almost certainly identical to Rothesay Castle.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2011) p. 192; Boardman (2007) p. 95; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 251–252; Tabraham (2005) p. 26; Brown (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 129; Pringle (1998) p. 152; McDonald (1997) pp. 90, 243; McGrail (1995) pp. 39–42; Cowan (1990) p. 115; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201. The Flateyjarbók, Frísbók, and Skálholtsbók versions of the saga specify that the castle fell after three days of battle,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 252 n. 34; Pringle (1998) p. 152; Anderson (1922) p. 476 n. 8; Kjær (1910) p. 466 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. and that three hundred Norwegians and Islesmen fell in the assault.Stell (2000) p. 277; Anderson (1922) p. 476 n. 9; Kjær (1910) p. 466 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) pp. 477–478 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. By this stage in the campaign, the fleet is stated to have reached a size of eighty ships,McDonald (2007b) p. 158; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 251; Pringle (1998) p. 152; McGrail (1995) p. 39; Anderson (1922) p. 476; Jónsson (1916) p. 557 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 465 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 477 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. a tally which may indicate that Óspakr's fighting-force numbered over three thousand men.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 251. The castle itself was a holding of Walter fitz Alan II, Steward of Scotland, and the attack upon this stronghold seems to evince the anxiety felt by the Meic Somairle in the face of the steward's steadily increasing regional influence.Oram (2011) p. 192; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 251. The sacking of Bute, the most important island-holding of one of the most powerful Scottish magnates, seems to have spurned the Scots into action. Reports that Alan was in the vicinity, at the command of a massive fleet, is stated to have forced the Norwegians to withdraw to Kintyre.Oram (2011) p. 192; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 252; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201; Anderson (1922) p. 476, 476 n. 12; Jónsson (1916) p. 557 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 466 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 478 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. Whilst the Eirspennill version of the saga numbers Alan's fleet at almost two hundred ships, the Flateyjarbók, Frísbók, and Skálholtsbók versions give a tally of one hundred and fifty.McDonald (2007a) pp. 71–72; McDonald (2007b) p. 156; Stringer (1998) p. 84; McDonald (1997) p. 92; Anderson (1922) p. 476, 476 n. 12; Jónsson (1916) p. 557 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 466 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 147 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 478 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138.

Either way, the saga reveals that Óspakr's fall was bitterly lamented amongst his followers.Oram (2013) ch. 4; McDonald (2007b) p. 158; Anderson (1922) p. 477; Jónsson (1916) p. 557 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 466 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 153 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 148 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 478 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 102 ch. 138. Command of the fleet was thereafter assumed by Óláfr, who successfully eluded Alan's forces, and diverted the fleet to Mann to suit his own needs. Although Óláfr was reinstated as king, he was forced to partition the realm with Guðrøðr, who took kingship in the Hebrides.McDonald (2019) p. 69; Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2011) p. 192; McNamee (2005); Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201. The latter was evidently in Norway before Óláfr's arrival, and may have been one of Óspakr's principal supporters.Oram (2013) ch. 4; McNamee (2005). One possibility is that Hákon originally intended for Óspakr and Guðrøðr to divide the kingdom at Óláfr's expense.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 38. Another possibility is that Hákon originally ordered a division of power between Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond,McDonald (2019) p. 69; McDonald (2007b) p. 87; Oram (2000) p. 128; Williams (1997) p. 151; Oram (1988) p. 139. and that Hákon originally promised to lend support to Óláfr's cause on the condition of a concession of authority to Guðrøðr,Oram (2000) p. 128; Oram (1988) p. 139. who—like Óspakr—could have been recognised as king by the Norwegian Crown.Beuermann (2010) p. 107 n. 25. In any case, the Norwegian forces left Mann for home in the following spring, and established Guðrøðr in the Hebrides. Before the end of 1231, the latter was slain under uncertain circumstances, and Óláfr regained control of the entire kingdom.Oram (2013) ch. 4; McNamee (2005); Oram (1988) pp. 139–140. Upon the homeward return of the Norwegians, Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar declares that Hákon's \\"honours had been won\\" as a result of the expedition, and that he heartily thanked the men for their service.McDonald (2007b) p. 158; Carpenter (2003) ch. 10 ¶ 64; McDonald (1997) p. 90; Anderson (1922) p. 478; Jónsson (1916) p. 558 ch. 169; Kjær (1910) p. 467 ch. 182/167; Dasent (1894) p. 154 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887) p. 148 ch. 167; Unger (1871) p. 478 ch. 173; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 103 ch. 138. king gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 156 fig. 1b, 163 fig. 8e. Despite Óspakr's elevation as king, it is uncertain how Hákon envisioned the governance of the Kingdom of the Isles. On one hand, it is possible that Hákon intended for Óspakr and Guðrøðr to divide the kingdom at Óláfr's expense. On the other hand, the fact that Óláfr's struggle against Alan and Meic Somairle is acclaimed by the saga could indicate that Hákon did not intend to replace Óláfr with Óspakr. Instead, Hákon may have planned for Óspakr to reign over the sprawling domain of Meic Somairle as a way to ensure the kindred's obedience. Óspakr's prospective realm, therefore, seems to have comprised Argyll, Kintyre, and the Inner Hebrides.Murray (2005) p. 295, 295 n. 47; McDonald (1997) p. 91; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201. If correct, the fleet's primary design would appear to have been the procurement of Óspakr's domain, whilst a secondary objective—adopted very late in the campaign—seems to have been the restoration of Óláfr on Mann.Duncan (1996) p. 548; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201. In consequence, Ruaidrí's nonappearance in the operation may have been due to resentment of Óspakr's prospective overlordship.Murray (2005) p. 295, 295 n. 47. Although Scottish sources fail to note the Norwegian campaign, its magnitude is revealed by English sources such as the thirteenth-century Annales de Dunstaplia and the Chronicle of Lanercost,Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2000) p. 131. with the former reporting that the campaigning Norwegians and Islesmen were only overcome with much labour after they had invaded Scotland and Mann and inflicted considerable casualties.Oram (2000) p. 131; Anderson (1922) p. 478; Luard (1866) p. 126.

In 1263, over thirty years after Óspakr's fateful campaign, Scottish aggression into the Isles precipitated yet another Norwegian expedition, this time led by Hákon himself.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 255–256; McDonald (1997) pp. 106–107; Cowan (1990) pp. 117–118. According to Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, when Hákon reached the southernmost Hebrides, a ship-commander named Ruðri swore allegiance to Hákon with his two brothers. Ruðri is recorded to have claimed Bute as his birthright, stating that he had been outlawed by the Scottish Crown for attempting to take back what was rightfully his. After Hákon's forces ravaged the island and captured Rothesay Castle, Ruðri is recorded to have slaughtered the Scottish prisoners, and to have devastated the Scottish mainland far and wide.Gough-Cooper (2013) p. 80; Boardman (2007) p. 95, 95 n. 33; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 257–258; Pringle (1998) p. 152; McDonald (1997) pp. 110–111; Cowan (1990) p. 120; Anderson (1922) pp. 620–621; Dasent (1894) pp. 350–351 ch. 321; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 338–339 ch. 321; Unger (1871) p. 574 ch. 329; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 222 ch. 279.

Although Ruðri's exact identity is unknown, he could well have been a member of the Meic Somairle.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 257; Carpenter (2003) ch. 12 ¶ 40; McDonald (1997) p. 111; Cowan (1990) pp. 120–121; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 203 n. 5.

Another is that he was a descendant of Ruaidrí.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 257. If Óspakr was indeed a forebear of Ruðri, the latter's actions on Bute may relate to the campaign of 1230, and may have been undertaken in the context of settling old scores.McDonald (1997) p. 111; Cowan (1990) p. 121. The castle itself—and the surrounding settlement of Rothesay—may owe its name to Ruðri, or perhaps to an ancestor of his.An Litir Bheag (2013); Gough-Cooper (2013) p. 80; Brugger (1929–1930) p. 15 n. 41; Henderson (1910) pp. 201–202. As for Óspakr's brothers Dubgall and Donnchad, nothing further is known of the former, whilst the latter went on to represent the Meic Dubgaill into the mid part of the thirteenth century.Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 201. The latter was a significant mainland magnate within the Scottish realm, and the fact that he is not recorded to have contributed to Óspakr's campaign after his release could be indicative of an attempt to accommodate the Meic Dubgaill's conflicting allegiances to both the Norwegian and Scottish Crowns.Oram (2013) ch. 4; Murray (2005) pp. 294–295.

Taxonomy  Cladogram of the trilobite genus Burlingia'Burlingia is the earlier genus of the family Burlingiidae, so it is presumable ancestral to the only other genus in this family, Schmalenseeia.  Description  Like all burlingiids, Burlingia is small (less than 1 cm long), has an overall ovate shape, proparian facial sutures, and raised anterior borders of the pleurae. Burlingia has between 10 and 15 thorax segments, while Schmalenseeia has between 7 and 9. It is however difficult to determine where the thorax meets the pygidium, particularly because uniquely, in Burlingia the pleurae of the pygidium are not fused. Burlingia differs further from most Schmalenseeia-species with the exception of S. acutangula in having a parallel-sided glabella that is abruptly rounded at front, and there is no ridge connecting the front of the glabella with the anterior border (the so-called plectrum).

Name  The Andaquí, sometimes written Andakí are also known as the Aguanunga or Churuba.  History  The Andakí are first mentioned in the texts of the Spanish conquistadors in the late 16th century, several decades after the uprisings against the Spanish initiated under the leadership of La Cacica Gaitana in 1536, that united the Yalcon, Nasa, Timaná and other indigenous nations from the Upper Magdalena Valley. In 1637, conquistador Francisco Dias was attacked by the Andakí and Pijao, which was reported in an act of the cabildo of Timaná on January 28 of that year. The Andakí resistance to colonization lasted until the 18th century and a 1721 uprising included all of the indigenous nations, such as the Andakí, Tama and Mocoa, of Putumayo and Caquetá.  Language  The Andakí language has been documented having two different recorded vocabularies. The first vocabulary is from an anonymous author from 1788 published in Lenguas de America (1928) and another recompilation by Manuel María Abis, published in 1855. Based on these works, Rivet (1924) classified Andakí as a Chibcha language. Though that classification was supported by some experts, others consider Andakí as a language isolate or without classification and others group it with Páez or other languages from the Amazonian foothills such Astinigua, Camsá and Cofán.  Currently  Currently Andaki communities survive in rural Acevedo, Huila and Belén de los Andaquíes, Caqueta, in the areas of the Pescado and Fragua Rivers, though these communities do not conserve their language. These communities are not recognized by the Colombian government though are documented by the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia as Andakí communities. According to elders from the Inga People that now live in part of what was the ancestral Andakí territory, they insist that there are still Andaquí in the forests below the Fragua peaks in the south of Cauca that refuse contact. Documents from the 19th century cite that area as the last known area of the jungle inhabited by the Andaquí.

He was one of the original founders of the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, New York, then went on to create a more radical artists' colony, the Maverick. Both Byrdcliffe and the Maverick are part of what is today called the Woodstock Art Colony.  Before Woodstock  White was born in Iowa and raised on a Kansas farm by his aunt after his mother died. A scholarship to Harvard University, where he read the works of the socially conscious art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900), solidified his burgeoning libertarian ideals.Tom Wolf, \\"Hervey White's Maverick Colony and Its Artists\\", in The Maverick: Hervey White's Colony of the Arts, exh. cat. Woodstock: Woodstock Artists Association and Museum, 2006, pp. 11–12. Pinpointing White's anti- patrician identity, artist and Byrdcliffe cofounder Bolton Brown (1864–1936) would describe White as \\"far prouder of hailing from a ranch in Kansas\\" than from Harvard.Bolton Brown, “Early Days at Woodstock,” published posthumously in 1937, reprinted in Bolton Coit Brown: A Retrospective, exh. cat. New Paltz: Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art, SUNY, 2003, p.74. After graduating and traveling through parts of Italy, White moved to Chicago and worked for Hull House, a settlement that provided a creative and educational environment for poor residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. In its spirit of democratic cultural outreach, Hull House acted as a model for White's Maverick Colony. While at Hull House, White wrote his first novel, Differences (1899).  Byrdcliffe and the Maverick  In 1902 White joined forces with Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead (1854–1929) and painter-lithographer Bolton Brown to found the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, New York, conceived as a utopian community of studios, workshops, and artistic gatherings which would nurture creative freedom in the idyllic setting of the Catskill Mountains. Byrdcliffe was based on models provided by the Arts and Crafts movement in England, including Ruskin's own unsuccessful artists' colony, St. George.Nancy E. Green, \\"The Reality of Beauty: Ralph Whitehead and the Seeds of a Utopia in John Ruskin, William Morris, and Victorian England\\", in Byrdcliffe: An American Arts and Crafts Colony, exh. cat. Ithaca: Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, 2004, pp. 38–40. However, shortly after the colony's establishment, Brown and White each parted ways with Whitehead—White by choice, while Brown was terminated.Derin Tanyol, \\"'Stone, The Most Perfect of Surfaces': Bolton Brown in the Sierra and Woodstock\\", Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide 11,2 (Summer 2012). Each found the aristocratic but reform-minded Whitehead's version of democracy too rigorously structured. In 1905, White purchased a farm just outside Woodstock with Fritz van der Loo and Carl Eric Lindin, intended as a rustic haven for the three friends and their families. It quickly transformed into an intellectual meeting place and was named the Maverick; artists, writers, and musicians took up residence in minimalistic houses, usually little more than shacks, built on the property. White's short-lived marriage to Byrdcliffe printmaker Vivian Bevans ended in 1908; White's homosexual leanings, addressed overtly in his writings, are a possible cause.Wolf, p. 14. White would go on to build the Maverick into a thriving community with makeshift studios, a printing press, and a steady output of publications devoted to literature and the visual arts, most notably The Wild Hawk and The Plowshare.Wolf, pp. 16-17.  The Maverick Festivals and Concerts  In 1915, White planned the first of the Maverick Festivals, which included music and theatrical performances. Bacchanalian and raucous but with a firmly creative underpinning, the Maverick Festivals were the precursors to the famous Woodstock Music Festival of 1969. Revelers were encouraged to come in costume; period photographs include men and women with flowers in their hair, a historical prototype for the popular cliché of the Woodstock hippie. Intended to offset the tremendous debt White incurred building his colony, the first Maverick Festival represented a great spirit of unity among previously feuding community activists and artists, who in 1919 went on to form the Woodstock Artists Association. The festivals were by the 1920s an annual occurrence, in August on the night of the full moon:Wolf, p. 19 they lasted until 1931, when their reputation for wildness (numbers of attendees reached, according to some reports, as many as 6000) pressured White to put an end to his tradition. In 1916 White began sponsoring concerts, primarily classical music; the Maverick concert hall has been home to performances by Paul Robeson and John Cage. Cage's notorious 4'33\\" premiered there in 1952. The Maverick Concerts music festival continues to this day, with a series of concerts held every weekend from late June through early September. It is the oldest continuous summer music festival in the United States. Hervey White's historical legacy is as an author, utopian, and philosopher. In popular press and local culture, his long hair, beard, baggy white linens and purple silks are celebrated as the hallmarks of Woodstock's cultural identity.\\"Woodstock of the Catskills and the Byrdcliffe Artists,\\" Christian Science Monitor (Jan. 8, 1924), p. 12.

Born at North Carlton in Melbourne to carpenter William Wallis and Mary Ann, née Gorman, he attended state schools at Horsham and Moreland before becoming a cutter's apprentice and journeyman. He joined the Victorian Socialist Party (VSP) when he was eighteen, and in 1906 was sent to gaol for thirty days for his part in the party's free speech campaign. On his release he joined the Victorian Clothing Operatives' Union and represented it in the Trades Hall Council, also being elected to the VSP's executive. However, the increased stress of these positions led to a breakdown and Wallis retired to the country to recover. He returned to his career in 1908 and in 1909 was elected president of the Victorian branch of the Federated Clothing Trades Union of Australia. From 1912 he represented his union at state conferences of the Australian Labor Party. In 1920 Wallis was appointed secretary of the Clothing Trades Union's Victorian branch and edited its journal, the Clothing Trades Gazette. At Collingwood on 5 March 1921 he married Josephine Wood. Wallis supported the Premiers' Plan and contested the Senate as a Labor candidate in 1931. In 1932 he was elected President of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, and in 1933 he was appointed the workers' delegate to the International Labour Conference in Geneva. In 1934 he was general secretary-treasurer of the Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union, serving until 1944. A workers' representative on the Women's Employment Board during World War II, Wallis was appointed a Commonwealth conciliation commissioner in 1947 and resigned his union positions. He retired in 1953 and died at Fitzroy in 1963. Always a controversial figure, Wallis's later career made him enemies among his former union colleagues and his tendency towards prejudice against women and anti- Semitism made him unpopular among the clothing trades.

It is the first in his series of small one act plays, Los Papeles Del Infierno [The Roles of Hell]. Plot The play tells the story of a Colombian schoolteacher, La Maestra, who is dead. This creates an eerie, dreamlike quality to the play. Each character she speaks to in the play is someone who has held importance in her past. In the beginning she is seated on a bench and the characters she interacts with do not see her, just as she does not see them. The play opens with the teacher describing the rain in the town and how everything becomes red and muddy. The play ends after the teacher is raped by army sergeants; she cannot eat because of the traumatizing experience and it begins to rain again. Characters La Maestra is the main character. She “converses” one-sidedly with each of the following characters. In the beginning, she states that she is dead and describes where she used to live-- in a house made of red clay with a straw roof. She grew up in a small town called “Hope” which was named by her father. She truly cares for the children whom she teaches; when she doesn’t eat she is thinking of the children. She teaches them the history of their country, Colombia. *Juana Pasambú: This is the schoolteachers’ aunt. She is the first person who replies to the schoolteacher. She questions why La Maestra lost her appetite. *Pedro Pasambú: This character is the schoolteachers’ uncle. After the schoolteacher tells Pedros’ wife that she can’t eat because she lost her appetite, he replies by recalling that she liked to eat bananas and corn on the cob with salt and butter. He is the second person who converses with the schoolteacher. *Tobías el Tuerto: (i.e., \\"Squint-Eyed Tobias\\" in English) He was the mayor who preceded her father. He says that he brought La Maestra water from the spring where she drank when she was a child and goes on to say that the Maestra refused to drink the water. *La Vieja Asunción: This is the midwife who delivered La Maestra into the world. She wails inquisitive remarks about why the schoolteacher wouldn’t take things from her and why the schoolteacher spit out the soup she offered her. All the while, there is a funeral procession occurring while the midwife is expressing her concerns to the schoolteacher. She refers to La Maestra as “my child”. *Sargento: This character is the police sergeant. He acts as though he is superior to the other characters. He is the character to whom La Maestra speaks with the most during the play. After the funeral procession, the sergeant confers with Peregrino Pasambú, the schoolteacher’s father, who makes is appearance on his knees. While the sergeant looks down on Peregrino Pasambú, he refers to him as “the big chief here”, because La Maestra’s father is the current mayor of the town. Because the sergeant is standing and Peregrino Pasambú is on his knees, the sergeant has power over the mayor. Peregrino Pasambú never replies to the sergeant’s statements or questions; he doesn’t have any lines in the play; the schoolteacher replies for him. The sergeant asks if the schoolteacher’s father got his land because of politics, to which the school teacher recounts that this was not the case; her father got their land because he was one of the founders of the town. The sergeant says that he is going to overrun the town and redistribute the land because “this land ain’t divided right.” He represents the authoritative power that the military held during this time in Colombian history. To this, the schoolteacher says that when her father assumed power as mayor, “the town was a jungle.” The sergeant complains to her father that the jobs weren’t distributed properly either, and proceeds to ask him if his daughter is the schoolteacher. La Maestra responds to him by saying that she was indeed the schoolteacher and she taught the child catechism and the country’s history. The sergeant grows angry at the schoolteacher and says that he was given orders to reassess and reorganize the town. He shoots Peregrino Pasambú and he and other soldiers subsequently rape La Maestra. *El Viejo or Peregrino Pasambú: This is La Maestras’ father. He is spoken to by the police sergeant, but doesn’t reply. Anything spoken to Peregrino Pasambú from the police sergeant is replied to by La Maestra. He helped assemble the town and land where La Maestra has lived her entire life. He is shot by the police sergeant. Themes The play deals with the ideas of life and death and how they are intertwined. A major theme is family and how it relates to tradition and culture. La Maestra was the schoolteacher in the town where she lived, and before that her mother was the first schoolteacher of the town; her mother taught her how to be a teacher and then La Maestra became a teacher just as her mother had done before her. Political themes linked to the play include the military and the government. Social themes in the play are violence and rape. The military dictatorship during the 1960s used excessive force as well as violence when they encroached upon towns, as they did in the town of “Hope”.

In October 1982 Mauchlen transferred to Motherwell where he soon gained a strong following amongst the supporters for his organisational skill and his aggression. He was appointed club captain in 1984 and helped his side to the First Division title that season. Motherwell were however suffering from financial difficulties at that time and, with Mauchlen one of their most saleable assets, it was only a matter of time before he left. In England Mauchlen moved to Leicester City in August 1985 as part of deal that also saw teammate Gary McAllister make the switch to Filbert Street.Ian Kelly, Hamilton Accies 25 Year Roller Coaster Ride, Paragon Publishing, 2010, p. 15 The deal amounted to a combined fee of £350,000.

Kyle, Historic spots in California, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2002, p.89 The creek was formerly a tributary of the Fresno Slough, in years of very heavy winter rains. Course Its source is on the northern slope of Santa Rita Peak in the Diablo Range, 5.9 miles southeast of Idria within San Benito County. It flows north then east into Fresno County, emerging from its Arroyo de Cantúa canyon, that divides the Big Blue Hills from the Ciervo Hills, into the western San Joaquin Valley. Continuing toward the Fresno Slough to the northeast, but no longer reaching it, Cantua Creek ends shortly after passing under Interstate 5, 4 miles south of the census-designated place of Cantua Creek and just west of the California Aqueduct. History The Arroyo de Cantúa was first explored by a detachment of troops under José de Guadalupe Cantúa (1786–1860) who served in the Spanish army, stationed at San Juan Bautista, and lead the party that first explored the Arroyo Cantúa area while gathering in the Native American people that lived in the area for the Mission San Juan.

Rancho de Cantua  Two of Guadalupe Cantúa's sons, Lupe and Domingo, later established a ranch on the Arroyo Cantúa. They were members of the California bandit Joaquin Murrieta's Five Joaquins Gang and their ranch in the mountains on the Arroyo Cantúa was the gathering place for the gangs herd of stolen horses and mustangs the gang would organize for the drive down to their ranch in Sonora, Mexico for later sale.Frank F. Latta, JOAQUIN MURRIETA AND HIS HORSE GANGS, Bear State Books, Santa Cruz, California. 1980. Historical Landmark The Arroyo de Cantúa has a California Historical Landmark #344, commemorating where California Rangers led by Harry Love were said to have killed Joaquin Murrieta and Three Fingered Jack (Tres Dedos) and capturing two others in 1853. The place was at Murrieta Spring a spring flowing from the south bank of the Cantúa forming a pool in the arroyo where it emerged from the foot of the western mountains, a mile above where California State Route 33 now crosses Cantua Creek. The spring was located about 100 yards above where the El Camino Viejo crossed the arroyo. Years later wells drilled to provide water for livestock stopped the flow of water from the Spring.

The Bīt-Abi-Rattaš kudurruKudurru BM 90835 BBSt No. IX top 1-25 in the British Museum. from the reign of Nabû-mukin-apli, 978-943 BC, begins with a recollection of an earlier legal document from Kār- Marduk, which may have been his capital, dated to his second year. It concerns a manslaughter settlement, where one Arad-Sibitti has killed the female slaveḫarmītu, a kind of slave, possibly linked to ḫarīmtu, “prostitute” (CAD Ḫ pp. 101, 104). of Buruša the bow-maker, ironically with an arrow. The king pronounced judgement and commanded Arad-Sibitta to give the plaintiff seven slaves in compensation and this was witnessed by seven high-ranking witnesses, of whom three were of Kassite origin and one, Ammenna, the officer, a Hurrian. He may be represented by the eleventh king in the Prophecy AProphecy A, reverse ii 2-9. whose rule likewise endures for three years. This describes the apocalyptic events of the king’s reign with cities being destroyed, rebellion, hostility against Akkad, disconnection from the rites at the Ekur and Nippur, and fragmentary but ominous events involving the Amurru and weapons. He was succeeded by his brother Širikti-Šuqamuna.

G. yamana is assigned to this genus because of the absence of an ink sac and crop, the presence of cartilaginous warts covering the body cavity, uniserial suckers on the arms, and a reduced radula. This genus has been found in the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean near hydrothermal vents. Its identifying characteristics are papillose skin, two horns located above the eyes, small gills, and five to seven lamellae located on the outside of the demibranch.

The Adventist presence in Canada dates back to the early and mid-1800s and the Millerite movement. William Miller, Joshua Himes, and Josiah Litch all helped build the Millerite cause on Canadian soil. The Seventh-day Adventist Church became an organized Canadian entity in the late 1870s starting in Quebec. By the first decade of the 1900s, the church had its roots down all across the continent. Today, all of Canada and the French possessions of St. Pierre and Miquelon comprise the official territory of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Canada. Its administrative units are the British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba-Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime Conferences and the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Newfoundland and Labrador. The 2018 Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook lists 388 churches and a membership of 71,376.Adventist Yearbook Retrieved March 11, 2019 Adventist enterprises include worship services in local congregations, annual regional \\"camp meetings\\", children's summer camps, a world session every five years, the publishing of tracts and journals, broadcast media, evangelistic meetings, and the operation of schools, medical facilities, and humanitarian enterprises. Early history ; Millerites in Canada The Seventh-day Adventist Church developed from the Millerite movement of the 1830s and 1840s. William Miller traveled in response to invitations. This led him to the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Miller, Joshua Himes, and Josiah Litch all visited Canada. Miller's sister lived in the Eastern Townships of Quebec.Fortin (1997) Josiah Litch lived in that district and led in Millerite activities there. Canada became an integral part of their activities. The interest in Miller's teachings was extensive in the Canadas and the Maritimes. Under the leadership of Josiah Litch, the first Millerite camp meeting took place in Canada, at Hatley, Quebec. ; Sabbatarian Adventists After the disappointment of October 22, 1844, Millerites developed into several divergent groups. The Sabbatarian group led by the Whites, Joseph Bates and others sought out the scattered Millerites and presented their Sabbath understanding to them. In the early 1850s Joseph Bates and Hiram Edson traveled along the northern shore of Lake Ontario trudging through knee-deep snow seeking out the Millerites. Thirty years later, the Adventist presence in Canada was still in its nascent stage. The first Seventh-day Adventist church in Canada was at South Stukely, Quebec. It organized on September 30, 1877, with 16 members. The Canada Conference, made up of members from both Ontario and Quebec provinces operated in the early 1880s. By the 1890s, North American Adventists were organized into Districts. District 1 included this Canada Conference as well as the mission fields of the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland.A. T. Robinson. General Conference Session Bulletin. March 8, 1891. http://documents.adventistarchives.org/Periodicals/GCSessionBulletins/GCB1891-02.pdf The Canadian Union Conference, 1901 In 1901 the Seventh-day Adventist Church introduced new mid-level administrative units called \\"Union Conferences\\" that took over much of the oversight of the local conferences from the General Conference Committee. On the East coast of the United States, the Eastern Union Conference was created. The first session of this union conference took place between November 27 and December 5, 1901, at South Lancaster, Massachusetts. Daniells mentions that the co-founder of the SDA Church, Ellen G. White, was present at this gathering in Massachusetts. He also mentions that the name of the union conference was changed to the Atlantic Union Conference. During this end-of-year session, a number of meetings were held with members of the General Conference Committee along with representatives from Canada, to organize a Canadian Union Conference. It was voted to proceed with the organization of a Canadian Union Conference. A constitution was established. Even though the new entity was called \\"The Canadian Union Conference\\", the territory included was only that of Eastern Canada, i.e. Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes and Newfoundland. Work was to go into effect on January 1, 1902 if two thirds of the Canadian churches agreed. Early Adventist work in the western part of Canada first came under Union organizations located in the western United States. Early in 1902, at the organizational meeting for the Pacific Union Conference, it was recommended that the believers in British Columbia be organized into their own separate conference within the Pacific Union. Two Union Conferences (Eastern) Canadian Union Conference The work of the church in Ontario and the eastern provinces retained the name of the Canadian Union Conference when the Western provinces were organized under a separate name. On New Year's Day, 1915, W. C. White, the son of Ellen G. White, visited at the Eastern Canada headquarters in Oshawa, Ontario. He stayed for several days. He spoke four times, three of which were at Buena Vista Academy (now Kingsway College). During his visit, he gave counsel to the leaders regarding how to extend Adventism in Eastern Canada. He urged them to start church work in new places immediately because \\"the last days are closing in upon us.\\" He said that ministers should be sent into new areas and that the lay people should take care of the existing churches. He also cited recent counsels from his mother calling on families to enter new areas as self-supporting missionaries. Western Canadian Union Conference In 1907 A. G. Daniells, President of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, visited the western Canadian provinces and announced the need to organize these provinces into a \\"western Canadian Union Conference\\". \\"This will give them courage, good cheer, and strength,\\" he wrote. He further noted that, \\"for a time it will need assistance from the States, but now is the time to give it. Let us remember western Canada in our prayers and gifts.\\" Canadian Union Conference The Great Depression affected the church as well as society at large. Several steps were taken to manage the church's finances during this time. The 1931 General Conference's annual council recommended that the two Canadian union conferences be merged into one for all of Canada and Newfoundland. Delegates representing these two organizations met on May 24, 1932 in Winnipeg and decided to merge the two unions. The president of the General Conference, C. H. Watson, and the president of the North American division, J. L. McEIhaney, were present. At this same session it was recommended that the Manitoba and Saskatchewan conferences be merged into one and that the Ontario and St. Lawrence conferences also be merged. Winnipeg became the location for this newly formed Canada-wide conference. Sunday closing legislation Early in January 1906, the Lord's Day Alliance (LDA) met with Canadian Prime Minister Laurier and his minister of Justice. They asked that a Sunday-observance bill be enacted during the next session of parliament. As the cabinet of the government discussed the issue, the LDA solicited petition signatures favoring the proposed bill. W. H. Thurston wrote to Laurier asking for a meeting. In his letter he explains that the proposed Sunday legislation attempts to legislate in God's domain rather than as civil matters. He quotes Matthew 22:21, \\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\\" On this basis the Seventh-day Adventist Church opposed the bill. The interview with Laurier and his minister of Justice took place January 18, 1906. Thurston, along with H. E. Rickard, A. O. Burrill, and Eugene Leland appeared before Laurier and his minister of Justice in Ottawa. They explained their principles on the issue and gave a brief history of Adventism and its worldwide work. Each of the group presented statements addressing the proposed bill. According to Thurston, \\"this meeting was reported to all the papers of the associated press, and the whole matter is before the public....\\" He continued, \\"We believe this effort will spread the knowledge of the truth and help to enlighten the people of Canada as nothing else would. Our own people are taking a more active part in the work than in the past, and we hope for a great awakening in this field from now on, and that the message may go with rapidity to all the people of Canada. The role of door-to-door book sellers The distribution of Seventh-day Adventist publications helped build the denomination in Canada. Most often, the colporteur, or book-sellers, led the way. Regional camp meetings The Canadian conferences of the church organized regional camp meetings as the United States conferences had been doing since the late 1860s. These camp meetings provided unity and fresh ideas for the church at large. Campmeetings are still run annually in BC, Alberta, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia for the general membership amd interested visitors. Ethnic group or language campmeetings are also offered. Relation to other Christian churches The Canadian Foodgrains Bank The Seventh-day Adventist Church has been a member church of the Canadian Foodgrains Bank since 1990.Foodgrains Bank, member church and agencies The Canadian Union Messenger, March 1990, p. 4 In this capacity, they associate with about thirty denominations. The United Church of Canada In the early twentieth century the United Church of Canada was founded. The Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational Churches of Canada united with a common creed and system of government. The process began in 1904. and reached completion in 1925. Adventists noted the new union's ambivalence regarding infant baptism. They agreed with the Baptist church's stand not to join the union because of the issue of baptism. To Adventists, the concept of church union was important but it was only to be entered into on the basis of agreed concepts of biblical truth. Relation to labour unions Carlyle B. Haynes led in the denominations war commission and after the war was given the task of managing problems that arose regarding membership in labour unions.http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/AAR/AAR19540222-V58-08__B/index.djvu?djvuopts&page;=16 As individual cases of difficulty arose in various parts of the United States and Canada, negotiations have been carried on with hundreds of local unions, most of which have agreed to our suggestions regarding withdrawal of our church members from all membership in labour unions on certain conditions. At the present time one thousand five hundred local labour unions in the United States and Canada have entered into agreement with us. What we have agreed to includes complete separation from labour union membership. Healthcare Seventh-day Adventist interest in healthcare began in the 1860s. It gained momentum under the leadership of John Harvey Kellogg in Battle Creek, Michigan. Kellogg's sanitarium inspired outreach centres in various countries. In Canada, centres were begun in Halifax, Nova Scotia; Knowlton, Quebec; Peterborough, Ontario. Later, an Adventist healthcare facility was built in Toronto; Branson Hospital. Branson lasted for several decades until it closed in the late 1980s. The current Adventist healthcare facilities are seniors' homes located near Saint John, New Brunswick; Toronto, Ontario; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Alberta and near Victoria, British Columbia. Health promotion, NEWSTART Through the Loma Linda University Public Health department, studies have been conducted on Seventh-day Adventists comparing them to the general population. The results show that the principles of healthful living, if followed, can lengthen a person's life by 11 years. In 1978 a guest at the Weimar Institute in Northern California made an acronym of the principles of Nutrition, Exercise, Water, Temperance (Self-discipline), Air, Rest, and Trust in God. A group of institutions across the United States advocated these health principles. Freedom of religion From the late 1800s Seventh-day Adventists have advocated the separation of church and state. Their interest in freedom of religion arose out of federal legislation in the United States which endorsed Sunday rest. In Canada, laws prohibiting labour on Sunday resulted in several cases where Adventists were arrested for working on Sunday. After the second world war, Canadian interest in human rights grew into a prominent political movement. John G. Diefenbaker advocated a Canadian Bill of Rights. He had provided legal representation for Adventists organizations on the prairies. Adventists considered him a friend. Lawyer Darren L. Michaels led the Canadian SDA Church to add their voice to those advocating the passage of a Canadian Bill of Rights.Michael, Darren L. Canadian Bill of Rights Brief. Canadian Union Messenger, January 21, 1959, Volume 28 Issue 2, p. 1 Michaels reported the issues involved to Adventist via their church paper, the Canadian Union Messenger. Membership statistics Canadian Seventh-day Adventist Membership by Decades The Presidents The Canadian Union (For a brief time, the Eastern Canadian church continued to be called the Canadian Union while in West, the Western Canadian Union had been established.) =W. H. Thurston, 1901–1909= W. H. Thurston, born November 14, 1855, at Kingston, Wisconsin. He entered his first ministerial work there around 1890.

Westphal and his wife, who were going to Argentina. The Thurstons were one of the firsts Adventists to work in Brazil. At the 1901 General Conference W. H. Thurston related stories of the work in Brazil. After the 1901 General Conference, he was asked to serve as head of the newly formed Canadian Union Conference covering, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces. Administrative highlights include: *the dedication of Knowlton Sanitarium (1903) in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Thurston's home became Knowlton. *Oversight and promotion of the Farmington/Williamsdale school in the Nova Scotia. *Encouraging church members to sell \\"Christ's Object Lessons\\" and other published material. *Moving the Canadian Union Conference headquarters and the Canadian Publishing Association from Montreal to Toronto.

Newfoundland and Labrador Comprising churches in the province, also built radio station VOAC in 1933 and changed its name to VOAR in 1938. The station broadcasts in a Christian format across Newfoundland, and other parts of Canada via repeaters. Maritimes At the 1895 annual meeting of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference it was voted that H. J. Farman, of New England, G. E. Langdon, of Nebraska, go to the Maritime Provinces to work. After his arrival, G. E. Langdon reported on evangelistic activity with D. A. Corkham, R. C. Porter, and R. S. Webber. The Maritime Conference organized in 1902 and covers local congregations and schools in PEI, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Quebec As mentioned above, Millerite Adventists lived in the Eastern Townships north of Vermont. Then, as the Sabbatarian Adventists visited these people, some joined in the observing of the Seventh-day Sabbath. The first Canadian Seventh-day Adventist church and school started in this area. The 1855 conversion of two french-speaking brothers led the way to pioneering work among the people of Quebec. Daniel Bourdeau and his older brother and Baptist preacher, Augustin, first heard the Seventh-day Adventist message from their brother-in-law, W. L. Saxby. They lived in Northern Vermont just south of the Quebec border. As part of their preparation for public meetings, they prepared two French tracts, one on the biblical Sabbath and the other on the prophecies of Daniel. By the winter of 1858-1859 the Bourdeau brothers preached in the border towns of northern Vermont and in villages in Southern Quebec. During the 1860s, the Bourdeau brothers wanted to reach the French speaking people with their message, but most of their work focused on the English people living in towns along the border between Vermont and Quebec. In 1869, the Vermont Conference had oversight for the work in Quebec. They voted to \\"pledge our prayers and hearty cooperation in the work of Foreign Missions [i.e., among the French], and that we will aid by our means, as may be necessary, to carry forward this important branch of the great work in which we are engaged.\\" The leaders of the newly organized denomination (1863) living in Battle Creek, Michigan, did not consider work among the French in Quebec a high priority. And, the Vermont Conference had limited\`financial resources. They couldn't afford to support both brothers in ministry. Thus, Daniel Bourdeau worked in California from 1868 to 1870. Then he went to work among French immigrants in Illinois and Wisconsin until about 1873. Knowlton, PQ 1903-1909 In 1875, Rodney Owen and his father-in-law, Daniel Bourdeau, conducted public meetings in West Bolton. Twelve people became Seventh-day Adventists. The next year, 1876, they repeated their lectures in South Stukely. Seven more joined the Church. Later that year, another series was conducted in Waterloo. And, in 1877, they did another series of meetings in Fulford. On September 30, 1877 the South Stukely church was organized. It is the oldest congregation in Canada today. It is about an hour from Montreal, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Seventh-day Adventist organized conference work in Canada began in 1880Land, p. 54 at an organizational meeting in Magog, Quebec. James White, President of the General Conference, presided over the proceeding.In October, 1880, George Butler would assume the Presidency and by next summer, James White died. His wife and church visionary, Ellen White, also attended along with former General Conference President and President- soon-to-be-again, George Butler. Augustin and Daniel Bourdeau attended, as well. This newly established \\"Seventh-day Adventist Conference of the Province of Quebec,\\" included the churches of South Stukely, Barford, and Westbury and two small groups, known as companies, in Sutton and Brome. The officers of the conference were: A. C. Bourdeau, President; D. T. Bourdeau, Secretary; and Andrew Blake, Treasurer. At the 1881 General Conference it was voted that the province of Ontario, which had been under the supervision of the Michigan Conference should be united with the Quebec Conference under the name of the Conference of Canada. The next year the Canada Conference meeting at Magog, Quebec affirmed the General Conference recommendation. \\"Resolved, That we indorse (sic) the recommendation of the late General Conference, concerning the annexation of the Province of Ontario to this Conference, and hereby invite Bro. D. T. Bourdeau to labor in the Canada Conference, in harmony with said recommendation.\\" Ontario One of the earliest sabbatarian Adventists to travel Canada West was George W. Holt. In the 1840s and 50s George Holt held a prominent place as a traveling preacher. He was \\"widely known and dearly loved.\\" In 1850, he visited Canada West making stops at Delaware and Ameliasburgh.http://docs.adventistarchives.org/docs/CH/CH1949__B/index.djvu?djvuopts&page;=224 Captains of the Host, p. 224 In 1851, Joseph Bates and Hiram Edson, hiked the length of Canada West from the St. Lawrence River to Toronto. They sought out fellow Millerites in order to teach them about the Sabbath. In a letter written from Toronto on New Year's Day, 1852, Bates describes their journey through knee deep snow. They made stops at Mariposa, Skewgog Lakes and Reach. Over twenty people decided to observe the Seventh-day Sabbath. In 1890, the Ontario Conference organized. In 1904, the fourth annual Indian camp-meeting was held on the Six Nation Reserve, near Brantford, Ont. It began on the evening of Oct. 7 and continued until the evening of the 16th. Manitoba- Saskatchewan The Manitoba Conference organized in 1903. The Saskatchewan Conference organized in 1912. The two conferences merged later. Alberta Adventists first came to Alberta in 1895. They were colporteurs Thomas Astleford and George W. Sowler. Sowler was the field agent for Manitoba and the Northwest, which included Alberta.Review and Herald, August 10, p. 14 Astleford and Sowler both sold \\"Bible Readings\\".Bible Readings for the Home Circle 1888 Astleford left Winnipeg and went to Edmonton. Sowler stopped off at Calgary and started work there. Sowler sold about two hundred copies of Bible Readings in Calgary. He also sold books to the ranchers from Calgary to Fort Macleod from the Bow River to the foothills. He worked in Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan and the mountain towns as far as Revelstoke. Eastward, he worked along the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway to Port Arthur.Western Canadian Tidings. Pioneer Colporteurs in Western Canada. Vol. 8 Calgary, Alberta, December 4, 1918 No. 23 p. 5 Thomas Astleford began in the Edmonton. He then sold books in the towns along the railroad to the south. His work led to the first converts in the province; Gustave Litke of Leduc and Dr. Menzel and his family, of Stony Plain. Litke shared his new faith with his German friends. In response to their request, H. J. Dirksen was sent from Manitoba. Dirksen led in the organizing of a church at Leduc on May 14, 1898, the first SDA church in the Northwest Territories.Sudds, D. R. Colporteurs Were First in Alberta. Canadian Union Messenger, October 19, 1966, p. 11 Up until 1903, the work of the Adventist church in Alberta was administered as part of the Manitoba Mission.

The Northern Union Conference, established in 1902, managed the work of the Adventist church in Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.Yearbook of the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination, 1907, p. 47 In 1906, the Alberta Mission was organized into the Alberta Conference.

(retrieved 1 Dec 2011) The four societies that successively occupied the valley and make up Calima culture are the Ilama, Yotoco, Sonso, and Malagana cultures. The Calima Darién Archaeological Museum and the Calima Gold Museum feature artifacts from the Calima culture. Ilama culture By 1500 BCE the Ilama culture, the first Agricultural-Pottery society, appeared along the Calima River, near the present day towns of Restrepo and Darien. Its society had a social structure of Cacicazgos (chiefdoms) that prevailed until the arrival of the Spaniards. The economy of Ilama was based on textile weaving, metallurgy, hunting, fishing, and agriculture. Yuca and beans were primary crops. The Chief or Cacique was the leader of the settlement. Other occupations were shamans, warriors, farmers, hunters, pottery men, and goldsmiths. Their ceramics were typically red and black, featuring religious imagery. Yotoco culture Calima Alligator Pendant, San Antonio Museum of Art By 100 CE the Ilamas developed into the Yotoco Culture, which expanded their territory further into the Cauca River and the Pacific Ocean and to the south to the region of what is now the city of Cali. The Yotocos prevailed in the region until 1200 CE and were a highly stratified society headed by caciques, which managed several settlements. The population had increased, forcing them to develop effective agricultural techniques to feed its population which also improved the techniques on pottery and metal works. They created polychrome ceramics and introduction of hammered goldware. The agriculture of the Yotocos was more varied than that of the Ilamas and was based on maize, yuca, beans, arracacha, achiote among others. The Yotoco started declining in the 6th century CE. Sonso culture Sonso culture (500–1200 CE) flourished during the Late Period I. Population increased, government became more centralized. Sonso culture was marked by fewer ceramic styles, and their goldware was mixed with copper and cast. Malagana culture The primary archaeological site for Malagana culture is Malagana. Dating from 300 BCE to 300 CE, the site was discovered in 1992, and an estimate four tons of artifacts were looted from it in a matter of days.\\"Hallazgo arqueológico en el estadio del Deportivo Cali .\\" El Dorado Colombia.

Retrieved 7 December 2011. Resilience refers to the ability of biological or social systems to overcome pressures and stresses by maintaining key functions through resisting or adapting to change.Holling, C.S. (1973) \\"Resilience and stability of ecological systems\\" Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4: 1–23. Reef resistance measures how well coral reefs tolerate changes in ocean chemistry, sea level, and sea surface temperature.Reef resilience toolkit model: Introduction The Nature Conservancy Retrieved 7 December 2011. Reef resistance and resilience are important factors in coral reef recovery from the effects of ocean acidification. Natural reef resilience can be used as a recovery model for coral reefs and an opportunity for management in marine protected areas (MPAs). __TOC__  Thermal tolerance  Many corals rely on a symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae for nutrient uptake through photosynthesis. Corals obtain about 60-85% of their total nutrition from symbiotic zooxanthellae.Fujise, L., Yamashita, H., Suzuki, G., Sasaki, K., Liao, L.M., Koike, K. (2014) Moderate thermal stress causes active and immediate expulsion of photosynthetically damaged zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium) from corals PLoS ONE, 9(12): 1-18. Slight increases in sea surface temperature can cause zooxanthellae to die. Coral hosts become bleached when they lose their zooxanthellae. Difference in symbionts, determined by genetic groupings (clades A-H), may explain thermal tolerance in corals.Sampayo, E.M., Ridgway, T., Bongaerts, P., Hoegh-Guldberg, O. (2008) \\"Bleaching susceptibility and mortality of corals are determined by fine-scale differences in symbiont type\\" PNAS Environmental Sciences, 105 (30): 10444–10449. Research has shown that some corals contain thermally-resistant clades of zooxanthellae. Corals housing primarily clade D symbionts, and certain types of thermally-resistant clade C symbionts, allow corals to avoid bleaching as severely as others experiencing the same stressor.Berkelmans, R. and M.J.H. van Oppen (2006) \\"The role of zooxanthellae in the thermal tolerance of corals: a 'nugget of hope' for coral reefs in an era of climate change\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 273: 2305–2312 Scientists remain in debate if thermal resistance in corals is due to a mixing or shifting of symbionts, or thermally resistant vs. thermally-sensitive types of zooxanthellae. Species of coral housing multiple types of zooxanthellae can withstand a 1-1.5 °C change in temperature. However, few species of coral are known to house multiple types of zooxanthellae. Corals are more likely to contain clade D symbionts after multiple coral bleaching events. Reef recovery Corals \\"seeded\\" with thermally-resistant zooxanthellae may become more resilient and able to resist coral bleaching Research studies of the Mediterranean species of coral Oculina patagonica reveal that the presence of endolithic algae in coral skeletons may provide additional energy which can result in post-bleaching recovery.Fine, Maoz, Loya, Yossi (2002) \\"Endolithic algae: an alternative source of photoassimilates during coral bleaching\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society, 269 (1497): 1205–1210. During bleaching, the loss of zooxanthellae decreases the amount of light absorbed by coral tissue, which allows increased amounts of photosynthetically active radiation to penetrate the coral skeleton. Greater amounts of photosynthetically active radiation in coral skeletons causes an increase in endolithic algae biomass and production of photoassimilates. During bleaching, the energy input to the coral tissue of phototrophic endoliths expands as the energy input of the zooxanthellae dwindles. This additional energy could explain the survival and rapid recovery of O. patagonica after bleaching events.  Coral Bleaching effects on Biodiversity  Parrot Fish Coral bleaching is a major consequence of stress on coral reefs. Bleaching events due to distinct temperature changes, pollution, and other shifts of environmental conditions are detrimental to coral health, but corals can restore from bleaching events if the stress is not chronic. When corals are exposed to a long period of severe stress, death may occur due to the loss of zooxanthellae, who are vital to the coral's survival because of the nutrients they supply. Coral bleaching, degradation, and death have a great effect on the surrounding ecosystem and biodiversity. Coral reefs are important, diverse ecosystems that host a plethora of organisms who contribute different services to maintain reef health. For example, herbivorous reef fish, like the parrotfish, maintain levels of macro algae. The upkeep of sea weed contributes to decreasing space competition for substrate seeking organisms, like corals, to establish and propagate, creating a stronger, more resilient reef. However, when corals become bleached, organisms often leave the coral reef habitat which in turn takes away the services that they were previously supplying. Reefs also administer many ecosystem services such as food provision for many people around the world who are dependent on fishing reefs to sustain themselves.  Anthropogenic Disturbances  Anthropogenic forces contribute to coral reef degradation, reducing their resiliency. Some anthropogenic forces that degrade corals include pollution, sedimentation from coastal development, and ocean acidification due to increased fossil fuel emissions. The combustion of fossil fuels results in the emission of green house gases, such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The ocean uptakes some of the emitted carbon dioxide, injurious to the natural processes that occur in the ocean. Ocean acidification results in a lower ocean water pH, negatively affecting the formation of calcium carbonate structures which are imperative to coral development. Developing coastal areas has the potential for chemical and nutrient pollution to run off into surrounding waters. Nutrient pollution causes the overgrowth of water plants which have the ability to out compete corals for space, nutrients, and other resources. Another anthropogenic force that degrades coral reefs is bottom trawling; a fishing practice that scrapes coral reef habitats and other bottom substrate dwelling organisms off the ocean floor. Bottom trawling results in physical wreckage and stress that leads to corals being broken and zooxanthellae expelled. Managing coral reefs In an attempt to prevent coral bleaching, scientists are experimenting by \\"seeding\\" corals that can host multiple types of zooxanthellae with thermally-resistant zooxanthellae. MPAs have begun to apply reef resilience management techniques in order to improve the 'immune system' of coral reefs and promote reef recovery after bleaching. The Nature Conservancy has developed, and is continually refining, a model to help manage and promote reef resilience. Although this model does not guarantee reef resilience, it is a comprehensible management model to follow. The principles outlined in their model are: * Representation and replication: Coral survivorship is ensured by representing and replicating resilient species and habitats in an MPA network. The presence of resilient species in management in MPAs will help protect corals from bleaching events and other natural disturbances. * Critical areas: Conservation priority areas provide protection to critical marine areas, such as sources of larvae for coral reef regeneration or nursery habitats for fish spawning. * Connectivity: Preserving the connectivity between coral reefs and surrounding habitats provides healthy coral communities and fish habitat. * Effective management: Resilience based strategies are based on reducing threats to maintain healthy reefs. Measurements of effective management of MPAs allows for adaptive management.

Description  Botanical illustration of Arabidopsis lyrata (1913)Arabidopsis lyrata are diploid plants that have a life span of two or more years, small white flowers and highly distinct basal leaves with a height of . The stem leaves are arranged alternately, with linear and slightly curved margins that are smooth and having a base that is tapered. The leaves of Arabidopsis lyrata have glucosinolates and trichomes as defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, and any other potential threats, such as fires and human activity. \\"The flowers on this species are quite tiny, ranging from 3–8 mm in size, they are pure white with four lobes, and are borne on wide rising pedicels, that range from 7 to 12 mm in length.\\" These plants are insect pollinated and tend to bloom between the months of May right through June and produces fruits in early August. The fruit of Arabidopsis lyrata are about in length, elongated, and papery, while the seeds are long, and are arranged in a row .  Habitat and range  Arabidopsis lyrata is found largely in subarctic or subalpine environments with thin soils, such as rock faces, eskers and talus slopes, or exposed coastal zones. Individual plants may form solitary rosettes, and are able to reproduce asexually through clonal patches. Lastly, Arabidopsis does not survive in agro-ecosystems in which weeds are rampant; it performs best under low competition and therefore has a life cycle that depends on germination, growth, and the setting of seeds in a very short amount of time before other species of plants can prevent light access. Arabidopsis lyrata has a circumpolar distribution, meaning it is found across northern and central Europe, Asia, and North America. In the US state of Virginia, it can be found growing in rocky woodlands, barrens, and crevices or thin-soiled ledges on outcrops of limestone, dolomite, siltstone, metasiltstone, amphibolite, metabasalt, diabase, and other mafic and felsic igneous and metamorphic rocks. It is also located in areas of the eastern United States where it is usually limited to sand bars. In Europe it has been found in southern Germany and restricted areas of Sweden.  Conservation  Arabidopsis lyrata has a large geographic range, but is often restricted to small, isolated populations, leading to conservation status that varies among jurisdictions. It is considered scarce but not threatened in the United Kingdom; its distribution is highly scattered throughout Scotland with single populations in Wales and Shetland. It is endangered or threatened in several states in the United States, which include Ohio, Vermont, and Massachusetts. Nevertheless, Arabidopsis lyrata is not included in the IUCN Red List. Physiology Geographically isolated populations, within Europe, of Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea have been shown to be metabolically different to each other. These populations also have distinct metabolism when exposed to cold temperatures in experimental conditions.  Reproduction  North American populations of Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata are typically outcrossing in the center of the distribution but exhibit a shift to selfing at range margins.  Importance to humans  Arabidopsis species provide the ability to address questions in speciation research due to the fact that they have a relatively short reproductive cycle and are easy to maintain. \\"Also, Arabidopsis lyrata varies considerably in habit preference, adaptation to local environment, life history strategies, genome structure, mating system, and chromosome number.\\" It has been particularly useful in understanding how populations diverge and how reproductive barriers arise. Arabidopsis species have also been eaten by indigenous people of Alaska, who eat the leaves by cooking them as a vegetable or use them as raw in salads.  Importance to ecosystem  The species that grow with Arabidopsis lyrata are Senecio obovatus, Viburnum rafinesquianum, Micranthes virginiensis, Asplenium platyneuron, Campanula rotundifolia, Carya species, Woodsia ilvensis, and Aquilegia canadensis. Arabidopsis lyrata is eaten by many herbivores such as the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris brassicae.

Opened in October 1987, it is located in the Taixing Park on the north side of Taixing City in Taizhou, Jiangsu province.  History On 15 October 1945, about one thousand people boarded the ferry Zhong'anlun () for a crossing of the Yangtze River from Wujin County to Taixing City, on orders that came from the Communist Party. The ferry sank about 2 km south of Taixing, resulting in the deaths of 800 people. Four decades later, the Jiangsu provincial government built a monument to commemorate the victims of the disaster. On 15 October 1987, the day of the 42nd anniversary of the ferry sinking, the Zhong'anlun Memorial was officially opened to the public. thumb  Monuments  The environment of the memorial hall is beautiful and solemn with many hemlocks and other plants. The first scene in the memorial is a horizontal monument 6.4 m wide; the front of the monument carries a vigorous and forceful inscription of eight Chinese characters: (\\"The heroic spirit of the martyrs will abide forever, as long as the river [flows into] the sea\\"), by General Ye Fei. On the back of the monument is an inscriptions in honor of those martyrs. Another monument at the site is a magnificent stone stele, 18.8 m high, with the inscription \\"Monument to the martyrs of the New Fourth Army's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Military Region who perished while crossing the river during their retreat to the north\\" ()\\", also written by Ye Fei. The base of monument resembles a sinking boat, to make a metaphor of the cause of martyrs' death. The side of the monument looks like a leaping spray, symbolizing the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs that can be eternal as long as the Yangtze River, from generation to generation.  Exhibition room  The exhibition room is the most important part of the memorial, and it is divided into three parts. They are \\"Suzhe Military Region, great achievements\\", \\"the great fame of martyrs, and the hopeful future of generation\\" and \\"inherit tradition, carry forward\\". There are many historical photos and biographies of martyrs are displayed here, including 63 photos, five charts and four entities. Their heroic deeds are admired by many tourists every year, especially in the Tomb Sweeping Day.

It was manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space Systems, is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and most of its scientific instruments were built by European agencies. The mission launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket and successfully landed at Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018 at 19:52:59 UTC. InSight traveled during its journey. InSight objectives are to place a seismometer, called SEIS, on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal heat flow using a heat probe called HP3 to study Mars' early geological evolution. This could bring a new understanding of how the Solar System's terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars – and Earth's Moon form and evolve. The lander was originally planned for launch in March 2016. An instrument problem delayed the launch beyond the 2016 launch window. NASA officials rescheduled the InSight launch to May 2018 and during the wait the instrument was repaired. This increased the total cost from to $830 million.*  History   Discovery Program selection  InSight comes together with the backshell and surface lander being joined, 2015. InSight was initially known as GEMS (Geophysical Monitoring Station), but its name was changed in early 2012 following a request by NASA. Out of 28 proposals from 2010, it was one of the three Discovery Program finalists receiving $3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study. In August 2012, InSight was selected for development and launch. Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with participation from scientists from several countries, the mission was cost- capped at $425 million, not including launch vehicle funding. By reusing the landing system designed for the Mars Phoenix lander, which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, mission costs and risks were reduced.  Schedule issues  Lockheed Martin began construction of the lander on 19 May 2014, with general testing starting on 27 May 2015. A persistent vacuum leak in the CNES-supplied seismometer known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) led NASA to postpone the planned launch in March 2016 to May 2018. When InSight was delayed, the rest of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin's factory in Colorado for storage, and the Atlas V rocket intended to launch the spacecraft was reassigned to the WorldView-4 mission. On 9 March 2016, NASA officials announced that InSight would be delayed until the 2018 launch window at an estimated cost of $150 million. The spacecraft was rescheduled to launch on 5 May 2018 for a Mars landing on 26 November at 15:00. The flight plan remained unchanged with launch using an Atlas V rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was tasked with redesigning and building a new vacuum enclosure for the SEIS instrument, while CNES conducted instrument integration and testing. On 22 November 2017, InSight completed testing in a thermal vacuum, also known as TVAC testing, where the spacecraft is put in simulated space conditions with reduced pressure and various thermal loads. On 23 January 2018, after a long storage, its solar panels were once again deployed and tested, and a second silicon chip containing 1.6 million names from the public was added to the lander.  Science background  The Apollo 11 seismometer, 1969.  Seismic vibrations  Seismometers on both Viking spacecraft were mounted on the lander, and picked up vibrations in 1976 from various operations of the lander and from the wind. However, the Viking 1 lander's seismometer did not deploy properly and did not unlock; the locked seismometer could not operate. The Viking 2 seismometer did unlock, and was able to vibrate and return data to Earth.https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2013/pdf/1178.pdf One problem was accounting for other data. On Sol 80, the Viking 2 seismometer detected an event. No wind data were recorded at the same time, so it was not possible to determine whether the data indicated a seismic event or wind gust. Other lacking data would have been useful to rule out other sources of vibrations. Two other problems were the location of the lander and that a certain level of wind on Mars caused a loss of sensitivity for the Viking 2 seismometer. InSight has many other sensors, is placed directly on the surface, and also has a windshield. Despite the difficulties, the Viking 2 seismometer readings were used to estimate a Martian geological crust thickness between at the Viking 2 lander site. The Viking 2 seismometer did detect vibrations from Mars winds complementing the meteorology results. There was the aforementioned candidate for a possible marsquake, but is not particularly definitive. The wind data did prove useful in its own right, and despite the limitations of the data, widespread and large marsquakes were not detected. Seismometers were also left on the Moon, starting with Apollo 11 in 1969, and also by Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 missions and provided many insights into lunar seismology, including the discovery of moonquakes. The Apollo seismic network, which was operated until 1977, detected at least 28 moonquakes up to 5.5 on the Richter scale. One of the aspects of the InSight mission is to compare the Earth, Moon, and Mars seismic data to learn more.  Planetary nutation  Radio Doppler measurements were taken with Viking and twenty years later with Mars Pathfinder, and in each case the axis of rotation of Mars was estimated. By combining this data the core size was constrained, because the change in axis of rotation over 20 years allowed a precession rate and from that the planet's moment of inertia to be estimated. InSight measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data.  Objectives  The InSight mission placed a single stationary lander on Mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and Solar System science: understanding the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner Solar System (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. Comparison of the interiors of Earth, Mars and the Moon (artist concept) InSight primary objective is to study the earliest evolutionary processes that shaped Mars. By studying the size, thickness, density and overall structure of Mars' core, mantle and crust, as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior, InSight will provide a glimpse into the evolutionary processes of all of the rocky planets in the inner Solar System. The rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins accretion. As the body increases in size, its interior heats up and evolves to become a terrestrial planet, containing a core, mantle and crust. Despite this common ancestry, each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through the poorly understood process of differentiation. InSight mission's goal is to improve the understanding of this process and, by extension, terrestrial evolution, by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by this differentiation: a terrestrial planet's core, mantle and crust. InSight lander on Mars (artist concept) The mission will determine if there is any seismic activity, measure the rate of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars' core and whether the core is liquid or solid. This data would be the first of its kind for Mars. It is also expected that frequent meteor airbursts (10–200 detectable events per year for InSight) will provide additional seismo- acoustic signals to probe the interior of Mars. The mission's secondary objective is to conduct an in-depth study of geophysics, tectonic activity and the effect of meteorite impacts on Mars, which could provide knowledge about such processes on Earth. Measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data. This is the first time a robotic lander dug this deep into the martian crust. In terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation, it is thought that Mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record, because it is big enough to have undergone the earliest accretion and internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets, but is small enough to have retained signs of those processes. The science phase is expected to last for two years.  Design  The InSight lander with solar panels deployed in a cleanroom. The mission further develops a design based on the 2008 Phoenix Mars lander. Because InSight is powered by solar panels, it landed near the equator to enable maximum power for a projected lifetime of two years (1 Martian year). The mission includes two relay microsatellites called Mars Cube One (MarCO) that launched with InSight but were flying in formation with InSight to Mars. Three major aspects to the InSight spacecraft are the cruise stage, the entry, descent, and landing system, and the lander.

The seismometer can also detect sources including atmospheric waves and tidal forces from Mars' moon Phobos. A leak in SEIS in 2016 had forced a two-year mission postponement. The SEIS instrument is supported by meteorological tools including a vector magnetometer provided by UCLA that measures magnetic disturbances, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction sensors based on the Spanish/Finnish Rover Environmental Monitoring Station; and a barometer from JPL. * The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) includes a radiometer and a heat flow probe. The probe, referred to as a \\"self-hammering nail\\" and nicknamed \\"the mole\\", was designed to burrow below the Martian surface while trailing a tether with embedded heat sensors to study the thermal properties of Mars' interior, and thus reveal unique information about the planet's geologic history. The tether contains precise temperature sensors every to measure the temperature profile of the subsurface. * The Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE) led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is a radio science experiment that uses the lander's X band radio to provide precise measurements of planetary rotation to better understand the interior of Mars. X band radio tracking, capable of an accuracy under , builds on previous Viking program and Mars Pathfinder data. The previous data allowed the core size to be estimated, but with more data from InSight, the nutation amplitude can be determined. Once spin axis direction, precession, and nutation amplitudes are better understood, it should be possible to calculate the size and density of the Martian core and mantle. This should increase the understanding of the formation of terrestrial planets (e.g. Earth) and rocky exoplanets. * Temperature and Winds for InSight (TWINS), fabricated by the Spanish Astrobiology Center, monitors weather at the landing site. * Laser RetroReflector for InSight (LaRRI) is a corner cube retroreflector provided by the Italian Space Agency and mounted on InSight top deck. It enables passive laser range-finding by orbiters after the lander is retired, and will function as a node in a proposed Mars geophysical network. This device previously flew on the Schiaparelli lander as the Instrument for Landing-Roving Laser Retroreflector Investigations (INRRI), and is an aluminum dome in diameter and in mass featuring eight fused silica reflectors. * Instrument Deployment Arm (IDA) is a robotic arm that deployed the SEIS, wind and thermal shield, and HP3 instruments to Mars' surface. It is a 4 DOF motorized manipulator, constructed from carbon-fiber composite tubes. Originally intended for the canceled Mars Surveyor mission, the IDA features a scoop, wax actuated grappling claw, and the IDC camera. * The Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) is a color camera based on the Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Science Laboratory navcam design. It is mounted on the Instrument Deployment Arm and images the instruments on the lander's deck and provides stereoscopic views of the terrain surrounding the landing site. It features a 45° field of view and uses a 1024 × 1024 pixel CCD detector. The IDC sensor was originally black and white for best resolution; a program was enacted that tested with a standard Hazcam and, since development deadlines and budgets were met, it was replaced with a color sensor. * The Instrument Context Camera (ICC) is a color camera based on the MER/MSL Hazcam design. It is mounted below the lander's deck, and with its wide-angle 120° panoramic field of view provides a complementary view of the instrument deployment area. Like the IDC, it uses a 1024 × 1024 pixel CCD detector. The two relay 6U cubesats were part of the overall InSight program, and were launched at the same time as the lander but they were attached to the centaur upper stage (InSight's second stage in the launch). They were ejected from the stage after launch and coasted to Mars independent of the main InSight cruise stage with the lander.  Journey to Mars   Launch  On 28 February 2018, InSight was shipped via C-17 cargo aircraft from the Lockheed Martin Space Systems building in Denver to the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in order to be integrated to the launch vehicle. The lander was launched on 5 May 2018 and arrived on Mars at approximately 19:54 UTC on 26 November 2018. The launch of the Atlas V rocket carrying InSight and MarCO from Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 3-E. The spacecraft was launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC on an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle (AV-078) from Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3-East. This was the first American interplanetary mission to launch from California. The launch was managed by NASA's Launch Services Program. InSight was originally scheduled for launch on 4 March 2016 on an Atlas V 401 (4 meter fairing/zero (0) solid rocket boosters/single (1) engine Centaur) from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, U.S., but was called off in December 2015 due to a vacuum leak on the SEIS instrument. The rescheduled launch window ran from 5 May to 8 June 2018. Major components of the launch vehicle include: * Common Core Booster * This launch did not use additional solid rocket boosters * Centaur with Relay CubeSats * InSight in a Payload fairing The journey to Mars took 6.5 months across for a touchdown on 26 November. After a successful landing, a three- month-long deployment phase commenced as part of its two-year (a little more than one Martian year) prime mission.  Cruise  An animation of InSight trajectory from 5 May 2018 to 26 November 2018: After its launch from Earth on 5 May in 2018, it coasted through interplanetary space for 6.5 months traveling across for a touchdown on 26 November in that year. InSight cruise stage departed Earth at a speed of . The MarCo probes were ejected from the 2nd stage Centaur booster and traveled to Mars independent of the InSight cruise stage, but they were all launched together. During the cruise to Mars, the InSight cruise stage made several course adjustments, and the first of these (TCM-1) took place on 22 May 2018. The cruise stage that carries the lander includes solar panels, antenna, star trackers, sun sensor, inertial measurement unit among its technologies. The thrusters are actually on the InSight lander itself, but there are cutouts in the shell so the relevant rockets can vent into space.Mars InSight – May 2018 – Page 36 The final course correction was 25 November 2018, the day before its touch down. A few hours before making contact with the Martian atmosphere, the cruise stage was jettisoned, on 26 November 2018.  Entry, descent, and landing  On 26 November 2018, at approximately 19:53 UTC, mission controllers received a signal via the Mars Cube One (MarCO) satellites that the spacecraft had successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia. After landing, the mission took three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments. It then began its mission of observing Mars, which is planned to last for two years. The spacecraft's mass that entered the atmosphere of Mars was .https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/landing/entry- descent-landing There were three major stages to InSight's landing: * Entry: after separating from the cruise stage the aeroshell enters the atmosphere and is subject to air and dust in the Martian atmosphere. * Parachute descent: at a certain speed and altitude a parachute is deployed to slow the lander further. * Rocket descent: closer to the ground the parachute is ejected and the lander uses rocket engines to slow the lander before touchdown. Landing sequence: * 25 November 2018, final course correction before EDL. * 26 November 2018, Cruise stage jettisoned before entering the atmosphere. * Several minutes later, the aeroshell containing the lander makes contact with the upper Martian atmosphere at . ** At this point it is above Mars and in the next few minutes it lands, but undergoes many stages. * Aeroshell is heated to during descent. * At and ~ above the surface, the parachute is deployed. * Several seconds later, the heat shield is jettisoned from the lander. * The landing legs extended. * Landing radar activated. * Backshell jettisoned at a speed of about and at altitude. * Landing rockets turned on. * Roughly from the ground constant velocity mode is entered. * Approaches ground at about . * Touchdowneach of the three lander legs have a sensor to detect ground contact. * Descent rockets are turned off at touchdown. * Begin surface operations. The lander's mass is about but on Mars, which has 0.376 of Earth's gravity, it only weighs the equivalent of a object on Earth. On 26 November 2018, InSight successfully touched down in Elysium Planitia. A few hours after landing, NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter relayed signals indicating that InSight solar panels had successfully unfurled and are generating enough electrical power to recharge its batteries daily. Odyssey also relayed a pair of images showing InSight landing site. More images were acquired in stereo pairs to create 3D images, allowing InSight to find the best locations on the surface to place the heat probe and seismometer. Over the next few weeks, InSight checked health indicators and monitor both weather and temperature conditions at the landing site.  Landing site  MRO (23 September 2019). InSight Lander – panorama (9 December 2018) As InSight science goals are not related to any particular surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the equator of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during EDL, be flat and relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and have soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground. An optimal area that meets all these requirements is Elysium Planitia, so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area. The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris, are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing. In September 2013, the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed down to four, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was then used to gain more information on each of the four potential sites before a final decision was made. Each site consists of a landing ellipse that measures about . In March 2017, scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that the landing site had been selected. It is located in western Elysium Planitia at . The landing site is about north from where the Curiosity rover is operating in Gale Crater. On 26 November 2018, the spacecraft successfully touched down at its landing site, and in early December 2018 InSight lander and EDL components were imaged from space on the surface of Mars. The images provided precise position of the lander: .  Surface operations  On 26 November 2018, NASA reported that the InSight lander had landed successfully on Mars. The meteorological suite (TWINS) and magnetometer are operational, and the mission would take up to three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments. After landing, the dust was allowed to settle for a few hours, during which time the solar array motors were warmed up and then the solar panels were unfurled. The lander then reported its systems' status, acquired some images, and it powered down to sleep mode for its first night on Mars. On its first sol on Mars it set a new solar power record of 4.6 kilowatt-hours generated for a single Martian day (known as a \\"sol\\"). This amount is enough to support operations and deploy the sensors. On 7 December 2018, InSight recorded the sounds of Martian winds with SEIS, which is able to record vibrations within human hearing range, although rather low (aka subwoofer-type sounds), and these were sent back to Earth. This was the first time the sound of Mars wind was heard after two previous attempts. On 19 December 2018, the SEIS instrument was deployed onto the surface of Mars next to the lander by its robotic arm, and it was commissioned on 4 February 2019.InSight lander completes seismometer deployment on Mars.

On 28 February 2019, the Heat and Physical Properties Package probe (HP³) started digging into the surface of Mars. The probe and its digging mole were intended to reach a maximum depth of after two months, but on 7 March 2019, the HP³ mole had only made it about , or three-quarters of the way out of its housing structure. Both NASA and DLR continue to look into the cause of the under-performing tool and for potential solutions. Scientifically useful measurements are possible at a depth of . In April 2019, NASA reported that the Mars InSight lander detected its first marsquake. AudioVideoFile; Sol 128; 6 April 2019) In September 2019, researchers reported that InSight uncovered unexplained magnetic pulses, and magnetic oscillations. In October 2019, the researchers at JPL concluded that the soil on Mars does not provide necessary friction for drilling, causing the mole to bounce around and form a wide pit around itself rather than dig deeper. They attempted a maneuver called in which they pressed the side of the scoop against the mole location to pin the side of the wall of the hole and increase friction. Jet Propulsion Lab, NASA. 3 October 2019. Pinning was initially successful, but then the mole backed out of its hole after a few weeks, suggesting the soil is accumulating below the mole. On 24 February 2020, a summary of studies over the past year from InSight was presented which indicated that the planet Mars has active quakes, dust devils and magnetic pulses. In February 2020, according to new data gathered from NASA's InSight lander, it was found that the Martian magnetic field at the landing site is about 10 times stronger than previously thought, and fluctuates rapidly. In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the scoop directly against the back cap of the mole, and determined the procedure to be acceptable. In June 2020, the team reported that the mole was finally underground, and was being evaluated to determine if the mole was able to dig as designed. On 9 July 2020, it was revealed that images taken on 20 June 2020 showed the mole bouncing again, indicating that it did not have sufficient friction to dig deeper. One suggested solution was to partially fill the hole with soil to increase friction. The operations team was able to use the scoop to assist the mole in digging deeper into its hole, by pressing against the back. The scoop was then used to fill the hole of the partially submerged mole, burying it fully for the first time. The team hopes the mole can now dig further into the surface on its own, but may need additional assistance using the scoop once again.  MarCO spacecraft  The Mars Cube One (MarCO) spacecraft are a pair of 6U CubeSats that piggybacked with the InSight mission to test CubeSat navigation and endurance in deep space, and to help relay real-time communications (with an eight-minute lightspeed delay) during the probe's entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase. The two 6U CubeSats, named MarCO A and B, are identical. They were launched along with InSight, but separated soon after reaching space, and they flew as a pair for redundancy while flanking the lander. They did not enter orbit, but flew past Mars during the EDL phase of the mission and relayed InSight telemetry in real time. The success of the MarCO spacecraft proved the viability of the cubesat platform for deep space missions and helped serve as a technical demonstration for potential future missions of a similar nature. On 5 February 2019, NASA reported that the CubeSats went silent, and are unlikely to be heard from again. * Mass: each. * Dimensions: each * Each has a reflectarray high gain antenna * Miniaturized radio operating in UHF (receive only) and X-band (receive and transmit). * They carry a miniature wide-angle camera.NASA's first image of Mars from a CubeSat.

Originally known simply as the Miami University Auditorium Building, it was renamed Benton Hall in 1926 after Guy Potter Benton, Miami's twelfth president, and renamed again for Miami's fifth president John W. Hall in 1969, when the university transferred Benton Hall's name to a new building. Hall Auditorium is the 3rd oldest building on Miami's campus proper, after Elliott and Stoddard Halls, built in 1820 and 1836. The building hosts concerts from university and outside groups, guest speakers, and other performances. Miami's philosophy department occupies the 2nd floor of the building, while the school's Performing Arts Series has office space in the main lobby. Construction and planning The Miami University Auditorium Building was built in 1907–08 on Miami University's campus, and was also known as the Administration Building. It was officially named Benton Hall in 1926 after Miami's twelfth president, Guy Potter Benton. Benton Hall also contained administrative offices, including the offices of the president, dean, and business manager on the second floor with the registrar, YMCA and The Miami Student holding office space on the main floor. Benton Hall was the principal assembly hall for graduations and commencements until 1932 when Withrow Court became the location of the major convocations and performing arts programs. The construction of the new administrative building (Roudebush Hall) was completed in 1956, and the Music Department moved to Benton Hall in place of the administrative offices. Since 1956, the building has contained the music department including the Performing Arts Series Office and the Philosophy Department. In the 1960s, there were purportedly plans to demolish the building due to an imminent expansion of Miami's King Library, so the Benton name was moved to the behavioral sciences building that had recently been built. In 1969, the planned razing did not occur, and the building was renamed Hall Auditorium in honor of Miami's fifth president, John W. Hall. Renovations The building was renovated from 1991 to 1993. It was a five and a half million dollar project that gutted the entire building, and only left one interior support wall, the floor on the ground level, and the woodwork and wood flooring in the lobby. Contractors removed the south end in order to double the size of the stage to improve the acoustics and sight. This reduced the capacity from 1,200 to 735, its current capacity. This is Miami's second largest auditorium, only smaller than Millett Hall. The designers added new lighting and state of the art sound systems. They decided to renovate because, according to Holly Wissing, Miami's spokesperson in 1993, the hall had become old and the acoustics needed to be improved. There was a grand opening performance by the Echternach Festival Orchestra. Guy Potter Benton What was previously known as Benton Hall was dedicated for Guy Potter Benton, who was president of Miami from 1902 until 1911. Benton was born in Kenton, Ohio on May 26, 2865. He received an A.B. degree from Baker University in 1886 and Ohio Wesleyan University that same year. He also received an A.M. degree from Baker in 1896 and Ohio Wesleyan in 1905; D.D. degree from Baker in 1900 and Ohio Wesleyan in 1905; LL.D. degree from Upper Iowa University in 1906 and Miami in 1916. He also went to the University of Wooster for graduate school. Benton was a licensed minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1886. Benton had also been the president of the Southeastern Kansas Teachers Association in 1891, Assistant State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Kansas 1895–96, and the President of Upper Iowa University from 1899 until 1902. At Miami, Benton promoted the founding of the first sorority, Delta Zeta and created the idea of having a fraternity house row on High Street. He served his own fraternity, Phi Delta Theta as national president. He took a leave of absence, and spent the 1909–10 school year in Europe. By the time Benton resigned in 1911 to become the president of the University of Vermont from 1911–19, the student enrollment had increased from 124 (in 1902) to over 1,200. The income had become almost a quarter of a million dollars, and seven new buildings had been constructed. After his presidency at Vermont, Benton went back to Europe with his family and became the head of war-time YMCA and was the educational director of the American Army Occupation. He went to Manila and became the president of the University of the Philippines after World War I from 1921–24. He contracted a rare disease while he was abroad and died on June 28, 1928. His funeral was in Benton Hall and he was buried in the Oxford Cemetery. John W. Hall Hall Auditorium is currently named for John W. Hall, the fifth president of Miami University. Hall was born in Orange County, North Carolina on January 19, 1802. Hall was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of West Tennessee at age 32. He was an evangelist and Pastor in Tennessee. In 1837, he organized and became president of a Female Seminary in Gallatin. He was a pastor in Dayton, Ohio and Huntsville, Alabama, and came to Miami to become president in 1854. He was president during the Civil War and had trouble as a southern in the north. He was accused of being disloyal to the Union. Dr. Alfred H. Upham wrote the following about Hall: \\"Doctor Hall, a fine Southern gentleman of the old school, who with rare tact and splendid self-control had directed the affairs of this patriotic northern college, found at last, when the struggle was over, that hostility had arisen and his usefulness was ended.\\" After his presidency at Miami, Hall went to Covington, Kentucky, where he served as Superintendent of Public schools from 1866–76. He died in Covington on January 6, 1886.

Plot  Jack Britton, the current welterweight champion, is at Danny Hogan's New Jersey training camp (called the \\"health farm\\" throughout the story) struggling to get in shape for his upcoming fight with favorite Jimmy Walcott. His trainer and friend Jerry Doyle is at the camp with him, and it is Doyle who narrates the story. Jack is not optimistic about the fight and does not adjust to life at the health farm; \\"He didn't like being away from his wife and the kids and he was sore and grouchy most of the time,\\" Doyle reports. Hogan and Doyle talk briefly about racehorses, and when they ask Jack whether he bets on them, Jack replies that he stopped because he lost money. Jack asks Doyle what he thinks of the shape he is in. Doyle tries to stall, saying: \\"Well, you can’t tell ... You got a week to get around into form,\\" but Jack asks for a straight answer. Doyle finally tells him, \\"You’re not right,\\" at which point Jack confides that he has been unable to sleep, despite being tired, because he misses his wife. Hogan, seeing Jack's condition a few days later, tells Doyle that Jack has no chance against Walcott. Doyle replies, \\"Well ... everybody’s got to get it sometime.\\" The day before the fight, Jack lists the things that concern him when he can not sleep: \\"I worry about property I got up in the Bronx, I worry about property I got in Florida. I worry about the kids. I worry about the wife. Sometimes I think about fights.\\" For the rest of the day Jack is in a foul mood as he tries to loosen up and run through a few rounds of shadowboxing, but even then he does not look good. Jack cannot break a sweat jumping rope and stops working for the day. That afternoon John Collins, Jack's manager, drives to the health farm with two well-dressed men named Steinfelt and Morgan. They go with Doyle to Jack's room and find him sleeping, but John wakes him up and asks Doyle to leave and tell Hogan the three visitors \\"want to see him in about half an hour.\\" Hogan tells Doyle that Steinfelt and Morgan are \\"wise guys\\" who own a pool-room, describing Steinfelt as a \\"big operator\\". Doyle and Hogan wait in the office, knowing the men do not want to be interrupted, until half an hour has elapsed. When they return to Jack's room, Steinfelt proposes having a drink. John, Steinfelt, Morgan, and Hogan all have several drinks; while Jack and Doyle only have one each. When John suggests Jack have another drink, he refuses - saying \\"I never liked to go to these wakes\\". The visitors leave. Jack remains quiet through the rest of the day. Later that evening, he drinks heavily and suggests Doyle put money on Walcott, confiding that he himself has bet \\"fifty grand\\" on the opposing boxer. He reassures himself of this action's morality, saying, \\"It ain't crooked. How can I beat him? Why not make money on it?\\" Jack eventually passes out and Doyle puts him to bed. Jack and Doyle make the journey to New York City the next morning, during which Jack is stingy with his money. After weighing in, Jack goes with Doyle to the hotel room the two are sharing; though Doyle’s brother-in-law lives in the area, Jack wants to get his money's worth out of the double room and asks him to stay. The two play cribbage and, when John comes, they continue playing until Jack has won four and a half dollars. Before dinner, he says they should play another round to decide who will pay for dinner. The cribbage continues after dinner, with Jack winning another two and a half dollars, until the time comes to go to Madison Square Garden. Entering the ring at the Garden, Jack meets Walcott's cheerful words with cranky abruptness. The fight begins. Doyle reports, \\"There wasn't anybody ever boxed better than Jack,\\" and the fight goes well for Jack for several rounds as his left fist repeatedly connects with Walcott's face. By the seventh round, Jack's left arm gets heavy and Walcott begins to gain the upper hand as he pummels Jack's torso. After the eleventh round John Collins tells Jack the fight will go to Walcott, but Jack says he thinks he can last through the twelfth round and goes to meet Walcott and \\"finish it off right to please himself.\\" Walcott backs Jack up against the ropes and delivers a very low blow; Jack, in obvious pain, stays standing–\\"if he went down, there go fifty thousand bucks\\" because he would win on a foul–and tells the referee not to call the foul because it must have been an accident. He walks toward the dumbfounded Walcott and begins swinging, landing several body punches before hitting his opponent twice below the belt. Walcott falls and wins the match on a foul. Back in the dressing room, Jack comments, \\"It’s funny how fast you can think when it means that much money.\\" John says, \\"You're some boy, Jack.\\" \\"No,\\" Jack replies. \\"It was nothing.\\"  Background and publication history   Story  Years before writing \\"Fifty Grand\\", Hemingway wrote a boxing story which appeared in the April 1916 edition of Oak Park High School’s literary magazine Tabula. This story, called \\"A Matter of Colour\\", was more obviously comical than \\"Fifty Grand\\", but the two bear several similarities, such as a non-protagonist narrator and a \\"trickster out-tricked\\" theme.Weeks, Robert P. \\"Wise-Guy Narrator and Trickster Out-Tricked in Hemingway’s 'Fifty Grand.'\\" New Critical Approaches to the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway by Jackson J. Benson. 1990, Duke University Press. Though authors today seldom write about boxing, stories like \\"Fifty Grand\\" were common and popular in the late 19th and early 20th century. For example, George Bernard Shaw's Cashel Byron's Profession, written in 1882 but not popular until about 20 years later, featured a prizefighter as its protagonist (though Shaw said the fight scenes in the novel were supposed to turn the public away from boxing). Jack London's \\"A Piece of Steak\\" was published in the Saturday Evening Post in November 1909. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also wrote several stories about boxing, such as Rodney Stone and The Croxley Master, and made his famous Sherlock Holmes an amateur boxer. Octavus Roy Cohen's \\"Last Blow\\", published on 2 October 1926 issue of Colliers, appeared the year before \\"Fifty Grand\\" and P. G. Wodehouse's \\"The Debut of Battling Billson\\" found a place in both Strand and Cosmopolitan in 1923, being published on both sides of the Atlantic. \\"Fifty Grand\\" thus fit into an established genre. Weeks writes, \\"Once The Sun Also Rises was sent off to the publisher, Hemingway wrote in his notebook in early 1926 that he wanted to write short stories 'for four or five months,'\\" and \\"Fifty Grand\\" was one of the results. In its original version, \\"Fifty Grand\\" opened with Jack answering a question about how he beat Benny Leonard. Jack says, \\"Well you see Benny's an awful smart boxer. All the time he's in there he's thinking and all the time he's thinking I was hitting him,\\" and the subsequent two and a half pages led into the story as it now exists. F. Scott Fitzgerald had urged Hemingway to submit \\"Fifty Grand\\" for publication, but the editor at Scribner's requested that Hemingway shorten the story. Hemingway, unable to remove anything from the story, allowed writer Manuel Komroff to cut it for him, but found his efforts unsatisfactory. The story finally appeared in the July 1927 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, under Ellery Sedgwick's owner-editorship, after Fitzgerald persuaded Hemingway to remove the first three pages, arguing that the Britton-Leonard fight they alluded to was too well known. Hemingway later resented Fitzgerald for this advice and scrawled on one of the typescripts of \\"Fifty Grand\\": \\"1st 3 pages of story mutilated by Scott Fitzgerald with his [undecipherable].\\"  Inspirations  Jack Britton Many scholars have searched for the inspiration behind this story in actual boxing matches Hemingway would have known of or attended. According to Philip G. and Rosemary R. Davies, Hemingway seems to have based the story on the 1 November 1922 welterweight championship fight between Jack Britton and Mickey Walker. Though Hemingway was traveling from Constantinople to Paris when the fight took place, \\"The use of similar or identical names for the characters and the stress on Brennan's age show the resemblance between the short story and actual circumstances\\", and Hemingway could have gleaned many of these details from newspapers. James J. Martine disagrees, however, writing that \\"the fictional Jack Brennan–Jimmy Walcott fight is an amalgamation of at least two real-life bouts\\", and arguing that Hemingway was simply \\"presenting the times\\" by writing of common occurrences such as fouls and attempted fixes, whatever influence the Britton–Walker fight may have had. He offers another possible influence, the Battling Siki–Georges Carpentier light heavyweight championship match of September 24, 1922. This fight, unlike the Britton–Walker bout, ended with a foul when Siki was clearly about to win the fight, an outcome which \\"started the hundreds of Americans at ringside to shouting 'robber.'\\" Martine adds, \\"If a man standing at ringside in a photo of the knockdown is not Hemingway, one critic has offered to eat the New York Times September 26, 1922, p. 14, and the rest of the paper.\\" Ultimately, he concludes, the events of \\"Fifty Grand\\" are representative of common events in the 1920s.  Themes and analysis   Themes  Many critics place Jack among Hemingway's \\"code heroes\\", though there is disagreement as to whether or not he adheres to the code entirely. Fenton noted in 1952 that Jack fits the ideals of a professional, showing the ability to think and commitment to and knowledge of his sport. His skill and craftsmanship in the ring stands in stark contrast to the brute strength and crude force employed by the slower, heavier Walcott. Fenton suggests that the story \\"clarified the relationship between courage and professionalism.\\" Hemingway never mentions courage by name in \\"Fifty Grand\\"; \\"It is apparent, however, that courage is a part of Brennan's behaviour\\", and that \\"Thinking ... is what distinguishes the professional.\\" Martine agrees that \\"Jack is the consummate professional\\", but offers the opposite reason: \\"He is a skilled and trained professional who does not have to think. The code relates to grace under pressure, in pain.\\" Philip G. and Rosemary R. Davies read Jack as a code hero, whose courage is partly obscured by the facts of the Britton–Walker fight on which they believe Hemingway based the story. \\"Brennan’s courage, while real, cannot reverse the impression created by the bulk of the story\\", they write, unable to find Jack admirable until the final pages. They argue that Hemingway tried to show Jack's courage by giving him motives other than the obvious monetary one—they cite the statement, \\"His money was all right and now he wanted to finish it off right to please himself. He didn't want to be knocked out\\", as evidence of Hemingway's attempt—but conclude of Hemingway stories in general, \\"The code of the hero can be seen most clearly when the courageous action is performed for its own sake.\\" Cassandre Meunier notes the emphasis Hemingway places on Jack's silence throughout the story. She writes, \\"The impression is that Jack finds confidence in private places: it is not necessary to explain to anyone what is good for him and his family; just shutting his eyes and cutting himself off from the external world gives him the confidence that his choice is—and eventually was—the right one.\\" As well as a source of confidence, she says, the boxer's \\"holding tight\\" in the early parts of the story prepare him for \\"holding tight\\" and finishing the fight in the midst of excruciating pain in the final scenes. \\"One of the features associated with dignity is control over oneself.\\" Robert P. Weeks, in his essay, found in Jackson J. Benson's collection of critical essays on Hemingway's works, comments on the machine imagery used during the boxing match itself: \\"During the first eleven rounds Jack boxes doggedly, mechanically ... Jerry also sees Walcott as a mechanism, but of a lower order.\\" The use of this imagery continues until Walcott fouls Jack. Then, \\"No longer a machine, Jack is alert, analytical, shrewd ... Walcott remains a machine: he's been signaled to deliver a low blow; he's done it; now he stands there baffled as the man he has fouled insists upon fighting on.\\" Weeks sees a great deal of humor in the story, humor which becomes evident when one takes \\"Fifty Grand\\" as the descendant of Hemingway's more obviously comical \\"A Matter of Colour\\". Even with the humor at both boxers' expense, he concludes that \\"Jack has done much more than protect his fifty grand; he has, through his quickwittedness and stoicism, prevailed without loss of his self-respect.\\"  The fix  Most critics and readers conclude that Jack agrees to lose the fight during his meeting with John Collins, Morgan, and Steinfelt. Earl Rovit believes that Jack \\"breaks [Hemingway's moral] code in betting against himself.\\" \\"There is nothing 'unethical'\\", Martine counters, \\"about getting some small consideration for participation in the game\\" in Hemingway’s view. James Tackach, on the other hand, argues that Jack did not agree to lose during the meeting with John Collins, Steinfelt, and Morgan. As evidence he cites Jack's assertion, \\"It ain't crooked. How can I beat him?\\", the illogicality for Steinfelt and Morgan to pay the underdog to throw the match, and that \\"If Jack agreed to lose the fight, he would have accepted a flat payment from Steinfelt and Morgan for the loss, and he would not have to risk his own money by laying a bet.\\" It may also be possible that Steinfelt and Morgan also organized for Walcott to throw the match with the low blow, as John reveals \\"They certainly tried a nice double-cross.\\"  Reception  Ernest Hemingway skiing, Switzerland, 1927 Men Without Women was variously received. Cosmopolitan magazine editor-in-chief Ray Long praised \\"Fifty Grand\\", calling it, \\"one of the best short stories that ever came to my hands...the best prize-fight story I ever read...a remarkable piece of realism.\\"Long, Ray - editor. (1932). \\"Why Editors Go Wrong: 'Fifty Grand' by Ernest Hemingway\\", 20 Best Stories in Ray Long's 20 Years as an Editor. New York: Crown Publishers. 1-3 However, some critics, among them Wilson Lee Dodd whose article entitled \\"Simple Annals of the Callous\\" appeared in the Saturday Review of Literature, found Hemingway's subjects lacking. Joseph Wood Krutch called the stories in Men Without Women \\"Sordid little catastrophes\\" involving \\"very vulgar people.\\"Weeks, Robert P., ed. Hemingway: A Collection of Critical Essays. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1962. Print.

(All very much alike, weariness too great, sordid small catastrophes, stack the cards on fate, very vulgar people, annals of the callous, dope fiends, soldiers, prostitutes, men without a gallus) Hemingway's style, on the other hand, received much acclaim.

He became apprenticed to a printer, John Holt of Williamsburg, Virginia, and married the man's daughter, Elizabeth Holt. In the American Revolutionary War he immediately threw in his lot with the American colonists. He participated in Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec in 1775 and was captured. After a prisoner exchange, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of artillery in January 1777. He performed notable service during the Danbury Raid in Connecticut during April 1777. At the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778 he distinguished himself while playing a major role in the engagement. After resigning from the army in a dispute over seniority, Oswald returned to a career in publishing and journalism. Over the next decade he published newspapers in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. In 1792 he went to France where he joined the French Revolution and assumed command of an artillery unit as colonel. After fighting at Jemappes he went on a secret mission to Ireland. He returned to New York in 1795 and died in an outbreak of Yellow Fever.

He was related to merchant Richard Oswald who later became the British commissioner for the Peace of Paris in 1783. Oswald traveled to America around 1770 and became involved in the patriot cause. He eventually settled in Connecticut.Boatner, 820 He became apprenticed to New York printer John Holt. Oswald married Holt's daughter Elizabeth (d. 1797) and their oldest son John Holt Oswald was born around 1777.McAllister Collection, Oswald Family Papers Oswald married Elizabeth in New York City on 2 January 1772.Oswald, Eleazer Oswald's descendants Immediately after the Battles of Lexington and Concord Oswald joined the American army. With Benedict Arnold he participated in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga on 10 May 1775. Oswald went with Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec in 1775 as one of five unattached volunteers. The other four were Aaron Burr, Matthias Ogden, Charles Porterfield, and John McGuire.Boatner, 31 On the night of 31 December 1775, Oswald took part in the Battle of Quebec. Benedict Arnold and Oswald accompanied the 25-man vanguard of Arnold's 600-strong column.Boatner, 907-908 He was wounded and captured in the battle. He was not exchanged until 10 January 1777 when he received a commission as lieutenant colonel in John Lamb's 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment. He performed noteworthy service at Compo Hill during the Danbury Raid. During the action, Lamb's three-gun battery made a valiant attempt to stop a British bayonet charge.Boatner, 316 Oswald served as Charles Lee's senior artillery officer at the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778. Under his authority were Captain Thomas Wells of the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment, two guns, Captain David Cook of the 3rd Artillery, two guns, Captain Thomas Seward of the 3rd Artillery, two guns, Captain Thomas Randall of the 2nd Artillery, two guns, and four guns of the 3rd Artillery attached to Charles Scott's brigade. Wells was attached to William Grayson's brigade, Cook to James Mitchell Varnum's brigade (under John Durkee), Seward to Anthony Wayne's brigade, and Randall to William Maxwell's brigade.Morrissey, 85 Charles Lee Since Lee had expressed doubts about the wisdom of harassing the retreat of Sir Henry Clinton's British army, George Washington placed the American advance guard under the command of Gilbert Motier, marquis de La Fayette. However, on 25 June Lee changed his mind and asked for the command. Since Lee was his second-in-command, Washington reinforced the advance guard to 5,500 troops and put Lee in charge. On 27 June Washington ordered Lee to attack Clinton's rear guard the next morning.Morrissey, 40-41 On 28 June, Lee's first units began to march at 7:00 AM. When they reached the bridge across Spottswood Middle Brook (West Morass), conflicting reports caused the column to delay. Eventually at 9:00 AM, Lee sent Wayne forward with an ad hoc force consisting of four guns under Oswald, Grayson's brigade, Henry Jackson's detachment, and Richard Butler's detachment.Morrissey, 46-47 These troops pushed back the Queen's Rangers but came under some cannon fire and fell back into some trees, leaving two of Oswald's guns exposed on their left flank. After his soldiers dispersed some British light dragoons, Lee sent John Durkee's brigade to support Oswald's guns. Almost immediately Durkee was wounded and replaced by Jeremiah Olney of the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment. Lee ordered La Fayette to take Wayne's original brigade and press the British left flank.Morrissey, 48-49 British light dragoon, 1775 Around 10:30 AM, Lee saw to his shock that Clinton was advancing with 6,000 troops. He doubted that his soldiers were capable of stopping their enemies.Morrissey, 52 Because Lee was recently released in a prisoner exchange, he failed to grasp the improvements in the American army since his capture in December 1776.Wright, 146 As Lee pondered his next more, he saw Oswald leading two of his guns to the rear. When Lee demanded to know why, Oswald explained that one cannon was disabled, the crews were exhausted from the day's extreme heat, and that the guns had run out of roundshot. Lee then authorized the move. At this time, Scott and Maxwell chose to fall back, either because they saw Oswald retreat or because they noticed Butler and Jackson changing position. This seems to have provoked other units to withdraw. When Lee realized what was happening, he issued orders for a general retreat. Oswald quickly organized a massed battery of 10 cannons to cover the move.Morrissey, 52-53 As the retreat continued, Oswald received orders first to hold and then to continue to fall back. Oswald broke up his grand battery, sending Cook's two guns to rejoin Olney's brigade and Randall's two guns to rejoin Maxwell's brigade. Meanwhile, the worn out men of Wells' battery were ordered out of the battle.Morrissey, 57 Around 11:00 AM, the American main body started to arrive in the area and Washington first learned of Lee's retreat.Morrissey, 60-61 As Lee tried to extemporize a defense line, he ordered Olney's brigade to hold a hedgerow while Wayne asked Walter Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey defend some woods on the left flank. With his four remaining guns, Oswald placed two on a hill behind the hedgerow to support Olney's men while the other two were ordered to cover Wayne's troops. Lee ordered Henry Livingston Jr. to help cover the two guns with Olney, but for some reason Livingston moved his entire command behind the hedgerow on Olney's left.Morrissey, 65 After a spirited combat the Brigade of Guards drove off the troops under Stewart and Ramsey. The action then focused on the hedgerow as the 16th Light Dragoons attacked and were repulsed. Clinton in person led forward the 1st and 2nd Grenadier Battalions. Oswald's guns blasted the British with grapeshot at but the elite troops overran the hedgerow. At this time the commanding officer of the 2nd Grenadiers, Henry Monckton was killed by grapeshot. Washington's artillery chief, Henry Knox ordered Oswald to withdraw his cannon across Spottswood Middle Brook. Despite the retreat, which was covered by Olney, no American guns fell into British hands. The next two hours were occupied by an artillery duel between 10 British pieces near the hedgerow and between 10 and 14 American cannons that Knox assembled on Perrine Ridge.Morrissey, 69-71 In the official orders of Monmouth, Oswald's actions were praised. After the battle Lee accused Washington of \\"cruel injustice\\" in a letter. The incident escalated until Lee was ordered to stand a court martial for disobedience of orders, making an unnecessary and disorderly retreat, and disrespect to the commander in chief.Boatner, 612 At the trial, Oswald, Knox, and others testified in Lee's defense. Nevertheless, Lee was found guilty and suspended from command for one year. Lee finally wrote a letter to Congress that was so insulting that he was dismissed from the army.Morrissey, 79-80 Journalist and soldier William Goddard Feeling that he should have been promoted, Oswald resigned from the army after Monmouth and joined William Goddard at the Maryland Journal in Baltimore, Maryland. While there, he printed Lee's criticisms of Washington, provoking a popular outcry against Oswald. He left the Maryland Journal and went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in April 1782 to start the Independent Gazetteer, or the Chronicle of Freedom, a harshly partisan newspaper. He opened Bradford's London Coffee House in 1783 and began printing the Price Current which was possibly the earliest business newspaper in the United States. In the summer of 1788, Oswald printed a piece in the Independent Gazetteer that made anonymous allegations against Andrew Browne, the head master of a girls' school. Browne demanded to know who made the charges against him and Oswald refused to provide the names. The head master then sued Oswald for libel on 2 July 1788. Under his own byline, Oswald responded by printing a broadside. In it Oswald claimed the \\"rights of the press and of freemen\\" were being attacked. He hinted that the legal action was a Federalist Party plot to harass him. He alluded to past libel actions in which he was acquitted. He asserted that libels were, \\"a doctrine incompatible with law and liberty, and at once destructive of the privileges of free country...\\". He proclaimed that Pennsylvanians would not allow, \\"the freedom of the press to be violated\\".Founders Documents, Respublica v. Oswald Alexander Hamilton On 12 July 1788, Oswald was charged with contempt of court in Respublica v. Oswald for publishing the broadside. Browne's attorney alleged that Oswald's purpose was to prejudice the minds of the public in a case that was pending. The court, while acknowledging the freedom of the press, nevertheless sentenced Oswald to one month in jail and a £10 fine. On 19 April 1809, Respublica v. Passmore limited the power of courts to issue summary contempts such as the one used against Oswald. In the summer of 1787, during and immediately after the Constitutional Convention, Oswald printed articles in support of ratification. After the convention concluded, however, Oswald began publishing pieces critical of the proposed constitution. The Independent Gazetteer was one of only twelve papers in the United States to regularly publish essays opposing ratification.Maier, 73-74 Between 5 October 1787 and 24 November 1788 a series of 24 anti-Federalist articles were published in the Independent Gazetteer and Freeman's Journal in Philadelphia. Written by Centinel the Letters of Centinel argued against adopting the United States Constitution. It is believed that Samuel Bryan wrote most of the articles, but that Oswald may have penned a few of them.Roland, Centinel Oswald moved to New York City and published the Independent Gazette, or New York Journal Revived. This was the journal that his father-in-law started. He came out against Alexander Hamilton in print and a duel between the two was narrowly averted by friends. In 1792 he traveled first to England, then France. On 18 September 1792, Oswald received a colonel's commission in the French army from General Charles François Dumouriez. He fought at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792 where he had command of four of the 24 artillery units. Historian Digby Smith noted that most of the Austrian casualties in the action were inflicted by cannon fire.Smith, 31 In a subsequent action at Liège, Oswald commanded 12 of the 24 units. On 16 January 1793 he left the army in Belgium to go on a secret mission for the French government. From 20 February to 8 June 1793 he was employed in Ireland where he reported on dissatisfaction with the British government. Being American, he was able to go about his espionage activities without causing suspicion. A remarkable set of documents survived in which Oswald sought reimbursement from the French government for expenses he incurred in the line of duty. On 11 and 23 July 1793 he sent the requests to the Minister of War Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte. His secret mission was certified by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Pierre Henri Hélène Marie Lebrun- Tondu. A letter of introduction from Thomas Paine testified that Oswald's motive was to repay France for helping America in its War of Independence. Oswald returned to New York City and died there of Yellow Fever on 30 September 1795. Family Including their eldest son John who was mentioned earlier, Oswald and his wife Elizabeth Holt had seven children. John Holt Oswald became an international merchant and died in 1810, leaving behind his wife Emily and three surviving children. Another son William Hunter Oswald (b. 1787) also went into international trade. He married Sarah Stamper Hall (b. 1792) and was working at Trieste on the Adriatic Sea in 1815. Thomas Oswald died without having any children, Ann never married, and Phoebe died in infancy. Rebecca married a man named Glenn and Elizabeth married Dr. George Balfour who joined the United States Army.

(2003). Jorge Velosa: Compositor colombiano Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango(BLÁA). Colombia.  Biography   Early life Velosa is the sixth of seven siblings. After completing his elementary education, he had to move to Bogotá to complete his secondary education, as there were no schools in his hometown. In the 1970s Velosa was admitted to National University of Colombia in Bogota, where he obtained a degree as a veterinary physician. There he met Javier Moreno, who made him the proposal to rescue and spread the traditional folkloric music from the Andes region in Colombia. After creating a band with Moreno and others, called Los Hermanos Rodríguez, they jumped to fame after an invitation to the festival Guitarra de Plata Campesina (Farmer Silver Guitar), organized by the local radio station Radio Furatena in Chiquinquirá. With this success they were invited to create a radio program for the station, which was to be called “Canta el Pueblo” (People Sing) with the idea of interacting with the locals and thus learning from them the traditions and folk knowledge. Because of this Velosa never actually practiced veterinary medicine, and rather engaged in acting, radio hosting, Costumbrismo poetry, and, particularly, to music. With the group he managed to gather he created a new musical genre called carranga which has become one of the most outstanding examples of Colombian folk music.  Los Carrangueros  The music ensemble he founded was named \\"Los Carrangueros de Ráquira\\", and was later renamed \\"Jorge Velosa y los Hermanos Torres,\\" and finally, \\"Velosa y los Carrangueros.\\" The remaining musicians were Jorge Eliecer González, José Fernando Rivas, y Manuel Cortés; Velosa sings and plays guacharaca and harmonica. Some of his most famous songs are \\"La cucharita\\", \\"Julia, Julia, Julia\\", \\"Las diabluras\\", \\"La gallina mellicera\\" and \\"El rey pobre\\". Velosa has also played roles in comedies in the national television such as Don Chinche and Romeo y buseta. He has been considered the first Colombian artist to play live in Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1981. Velosa and the Carrangueros were invited to the \\"Gran Fiesta en el Madison,\\" a Latin-American variety show at the Madison Square Garden during the days of October 10 and 11, 1981. They were described by the New York Times as \\"the only real folk music of the event,\\" and shared the stage with incredibly famous Latin-American singers and musicians like Astor Piazzolla, José Luis Rodríguez, Camilo Sesto, Roberto Carlos, Miguel Bosé, Lucía Méndez, and Tito Puente.Stephen Holden. Pop: 'Gran Fiesta,' Galaxy of Spanish-Speaking Stars. The New York Times, October 13, 1981, p. C10 About the gig, Velosa humorously tells that they were not picked up by the limousine that was sent for them because of their wearing the traditional ruanas (a poncho-like woolen coat) and hats that they use on each of their presentations. In September 25, 1999, the car that transported him and his band from a late concert towards the city of Bucaramanga was intercepted by guerrilla soldiers from the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), who after recognizing him decided to kidnap him, after releasing all of the other band members. Later, the guerrilla group would claim that Velosa had been kidnapped for political reasons rather than for monetary purposes. After numerous protests throughout the country, and some conciliation by officials from the government he was released in October 14, 1999. In celebration of his 30th anniversary as a professional musician, in 2010 he had a concert tour with the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia.  Distinctions As a sign of recognition to his work, biologist John Lynch named two recently found species of frogs in Colombia after him, Eleutherodactylus carranguerorum and Eleutherodactylus jorgevelosai.

A recurring goal of his research is to create a mathematical model that predicts the stress in a flowing material as a functional of the flow history of that material. Such a mathematical model is called a constitutive equation. He has worked on theories of active matter, particularly dense suspensions of self- propelled particles which can include motile bacteria. His interests also include fundamental field theories of active systems in which time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry, and more generally, CPT symmetry) is absent. Such theories are characterised by nonzero steady-state Entropy production.

The pavilion hosts a replica of Kedukan Bukit Inscription. Srivijaya archaeological park (), formerly known as Karanganyar archaeological site, is the ancient remnants of a garden and habitation area near the northern bank of Musi river within Palembang vicinity, South Sumatra, Indonesia. Remnants of ancient man-made canals, moats, ponds and artificial islands discovered in this area suggests the site was related with a 9th- century settlement related to the Srivijaya empire. Several artifacts, such as Buddhist statues, beads, pottery and Chinese ceramics were found in this area, confirming the area was once a dense human habitation. Archaeological site Srivijaya Archaeological Park located Southwest from Palembang city center (green). The site forming an axis connecting Bukit Seguntang and Musi River. The archaeological park is located in Jalan Syakhyakirti, Kelurahan Karanganyar, Kecamatan Gandus, Palembang, on an alluvial plain of the Musi River near its junction with the Ogan and Kramasan rivers. Before the archeological excavation of the site in the late 1980s, the site of Karanganyar was thought to be a potential site for a Srivijayan political power center. However, immediately after the first excavations, the site, with its waterways, reservoirs, and \\"floating islands\\" (balai kambang) was thought to be more related with the site of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II, early 19th- century leader of the Palembang Sultanate. Mahmud Badaruddin II had acquired the land and had started developing the area, probably to prepare his own burial ground, following a Palembang tradition in which the burial of the members of the royal family were to be done on site surrounded by water flowing into the Musi River. Karanganyar site had indeed been occupied in Srivijayan times, mainly in the 9th-century, however the only traces left of this period are a scatter of surface finds of contemporary artifacts e.g. Chinese ceramics, a few layers of ancient brick wall, and possibly one ancient canal. So far, archaeologists has found nothing in the site that can legitimately assign the Karanganyar site to the Srivijayan dynasty instead of to the Palembang Sultanate. Other archaeological sites to Karanganyar that is related with the 7th - 15th centuries Srivijayan dynasty are the Kambang Unglen, Padang Kapas, Ladang Sirap and Bukit Seguntang, and still for a variety of reasons, identification of confirmed archaeological sites of the Srivijayan period remains ambiguous. The Karanganyar site elevation is less than from the surface of Musi river. Located around southwest from Palembang city center or south from Seguntang hill, the site can be accessed with public transportation heading to Tangga Batu. The site consists of three sub-sites: Karanganyar 1, 2, and 3. The largest site, Karanganyar 1, takes the plan of a rectangular pond measuring . In the center of the pond are two artificial islands: Nangka () and Cempaka (). Moats measuring () surround Nangka island. Sub-site Karanganyar 2, southwest of the main pond, takes the plan of a small pond with a small square artificial island measuring (). Sub-site Karanganyar 3 is a pond located east of Karanganyar 1 measuring . Seven canals connected the three sub-sites. Canal 1, identified by locals as Parit Suak Bujang, is the largest and longest, measuring long and wide with both ends connected to the Musi river. The long canal 2 is parallel with canal 1, located south of the Karanganyar 1 and 3 sites. The west end of canal 2 ends in the Karanganyar 2 site, while the east end connects to the Musi river. Canal 1 and Canal 2 are connected by the long canal 3 that runs along the north-south axis located between sub-sites 1 and 3. Parallel to canal 3 are canal 4 and 5 located west of sub-site 1 with their south ends connecting to canal 2. There are two canals, canal 6 and 7, that connect canal 2 with the Musi river in the south side. History Aerial photographs taken in 1984 revealed the canal network span in the Karanganyar site, confirming some ancient landscape modifications and man-made water structures. The canals compound is located not far from the location where the Kedukan Bukit Inscription was discovered. Moreover, the Karanganyar site is located not far from Bukit Seguntang, the highest point of Palembang, which is also an important archaeological site containing some archaeological fragments; inscriptions, ancient tombs, as well as an Amaravati-style statue of Buddha. The government of South Sumatra province renovated the site to create an archaeological park, and the completion of the park construction was overseen on 22 December 1994 by Indonesian president Suharto. The archaeological park also hosts the Srivijaya Museum, which serves as the information center of Srivijayan history and sites in Palembang. In the center of this site there is a pavilion constructed in Limasan Palembang traditional architecture that contains the replica of the Kedukan Bukit inscription placed in a glass case. The inscription tells the Siddhayatra journey of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa, considered as the establishment of Srivijayan empire. After having been established for more than a decade, the Srivijaya archaeological park has not fulfilled its expected function as the center of information and education as well as tourist attraction. Because of the lack of information and promotion and poor maintenance, most of the Palembang citizen are unaware of its existence and its function as the center of information about Srivijayan sites in Palembang. All this time both the local government and the people have paid little attention to this archaeological park. Today, the archaeological park is poorly maintained and only attract a few of visitors. Archaeological findings Cempaka island, an artificial island in the middle of a pond. Artifact findings discovered in this area revealed the everyday life of its inhabitants, such as colorful beads, amber, ropes made from arenga pinnata fibers, brick structure, Chinese ceramics, pottery, and the remnant of a wooden ship. Most of these findings were discovered during the construction of the archaeological park. Reconstruction of pottery and ceramics fragments revealed daily domestic objects such as a vase, water vessel, bowl, plate, stove, clay pot, and roof. These domestic artifacts suggest the area was once a dense human habitation. The water structures such as canals, ponds and artificial islands also confirm human habitation for long periods. The people that once inhabited the area probably built these canals for water drainage to prevent flooding as well as water transportation to connect the Musi River with inland areas. Between 1985 and 1989 archaeological excavation was conducted and discovered fragments of pottery, ceramics, beads, and brick structure. The Chinese ceramics discovered here are dated from Tang, Sung, Yuan and Qing dynasties, spanning the 7th to 19th centuries. Excavation in Cempaka island revealed a brick structure buried deep with east-west axis. Other than canals and the small brick structure, there are no significant building or temple ruins discovered on this site. Archaeology experts suggest the lack of building ruins is because the site is located near a large river surrounded by tropical rainforest with no stone quarry near the area. As the result the temple, palace, and houses were probably built from wood and bricks, organic materials that easily decay and were destroyed by frequent flooding of the river and humidity in less than 200 years.

The program followed the daily lives of five Lebanese-American Shia Muslim families in Dearborn, Michigan, the largest Muslim community in the United States. All-American Muslim premiered on November 13, 2011. TLC canceled All-American Muslim after one season, citing low ratings. Format Each episode follows members of various Shia Islamic families going through the events of their daily lives, with emphasis placed on how their faith affects their actions. Interview segments with individual cast members are interspersed throughout, in which they explain specific points of Islam and how they relate to the various situations. Cast members also appear in short round table segments in which they discuss general principles of Islam as they relate to specific events depicted in the episode. Cast * Amen family: Parents Mohsen and Lila Amen and their adult children Suehaila, Shadia, Bilal and Samira. Shadia has a son, Adam, and in the first episode she marries Jeff McDermott who converted to Islam from Catholicism to marry Shadia. Samira is married to Ali Fawaz. * Aoude family: Nader and Nawal Aoude have their first child, Naseem, in episode four. * Bazzy-Aliahmad family: Ali and Nina Bazzy- Aliahmad have one son, Andre. * Jaafar family: Mike and Angela Jaafar have four children, Jenna, Julia, Jad and Ryan. * Zaban family: Fouad and Zaynab Zaban have four children, Jamilah, Ayah, Mohamed and Fatima. Development TLC ordered All-American Muslim from Shed Media U.S. in July 2011. The initial order was for eight 30-minute episodes. The episode length later expanded to 60 minutes. TLC general manager Amy Winter said, \\"We wanted to show there was diversity even within the Muslim community. These are families that might have beliefs that are different than yours, but we are all living similar daily lives and hopefully we will bring that to light.\\" Before deciding on Dearborn, TLC considered Muslim communities in San Diego, Washington and Northern Virginia. Episodes Critical and popular response Following a screening at the 2011 Television Critics Association Press Tour, The Hollywood Reporter dubbed All-American Muslim \\"fascinating\\". Noting that the participants believed the series was not intended to be educational, THR nonetheless felt that \\"watching their lives will teach us a lot about the culture of Americans who practice Islam and how they're both similar and unique from us\\". In a formal review following the series premiere, THR reiterated its praise. With the caveat that the series might look very different were it focused on Dearborn's more conservative Palestinian or Yemeni communities, THR found the series \\"undeniably authentic and moving\\" and that viewers would come away with a greater understanding of the Muslim-American community. The series premiere was viewed by 1.7 million viewers. Ratings dropped for subsequent episodes, with the December 18 episode registering 900,000 viewers. The series has averaged 1 million viewers per episode. Sponsorship controversy TLC General Manager Amy Winter was asked about the possibility of sponsor backlash while the series was in production. She responded, \\"We usually find with TLC that the backlash occurs as soon as we start marketing something and once viewers experience the show, we get a far different response.\\" On December 9, 2011, born-again Christian David Caton, the \\"founder and sole employee\\" of the Florida Family Association,Samuel G. Freedman, \\"Waging a One-Man War on American Muslims\\" , New York Times, 16 December 2011 sent e-mails to various companies, claiming that the show is favorable propaganda for Muslims and urging them to withdraw their sponsorship from the show. The home-improvement chain Lowe's did so. FFA posted an email (which Lowe's described as a \\"form letter\\") in which the chain noted FFA's communication and informed the group that it would pull its advertising. A chain spokesperson said it was because of \\"concerns, complaints or issues from multiple sides of the viewer spectrum\\" and did not mention the FFA specifically. Lowe's later posted to its Twitter feed: \\"We did not pull our ads based solely on the complaints or emails of any one group. It is never our intent to alienate anyone. Lowe's values diversity of thought in everyone, including our employees and prospective customers.\\" In response to Lowe's decision, celebrities including Russell Simmons and Mia Farrow called for a boycott of the retail outlet. Simmons bought advertising time for the episode scheduled to air December 18, 2011. Actor and former Associate Director in the White House Office of Public Engagement Kal Penn also called for a boycott. Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, criticized Lowe's decision \\"to uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group and not the creed of the 1st Amendment.\\" Representative John Conyers of Michigan called on Lowe's to apologize. Michigan state representative Rashida Tlaib contacted the company's corporate headquarters, reporting that Lowe's declined to change its decision. California state senator Ted Lieu also issued a boycott call, labeling the Lowe's action \\"bigoted, shameful, and un-American\\". He further stated he would explore \\"legislative remedies\\" if Lowe's did not rescind its decision. Muslim- American and Arab-American activists joined in the criticism. The American- Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee called upon members to contact Lowe's to urge it to reverse its position. The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations met to consider possible actions, including boycotts and protests. The Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, based in Dearborn, and the National Network for Arab-American Communities announced that they would no longer accept donations from Lowe's. In response, Lowe's stated, \\"As you know, the TLC program 'All-American Muslim' has become a lightning rod for people to voice complaints from a variety of perspectives – political, social and otherwise. Following this development, dozens of companies removed their advertising from the program beginning in late November. Lowe's made the decision to discontinue our advertising on Dec. 5. As we shared yesterday, we have a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, and we're proud of that longstanding commitment. If we have made anyone question that commitment, we apologize.\\" FFA stated that 65 companies removed their advertising from the series, including Kayak.com. Kayak's chief marketing officer, Robert Birge, released a statement that TLC was \\"not upfront\\" about the nature of the series and that the decision to pull the company's advertising was based in part on the quality of the series, which he said \\"sucked\\". Archived page requires scrolldown. Three companies, Campbell Soup Company, Sears Holdings Corporation and Bank of America, disputed FFA's assertion. TLC said advertising support remained strong. A member of the Internet civil disobedience group Anonymous hacked the FFA's website in response to the controversy, exposing personal information about FFA newsletter subscribers and donors and condemning the group for \\"hatred, bigotry and fear mongering towards gays, lesbians and most recently Muslim Americans\\". Lowe's received a petition on December 20, 2011, calling on Lowe's to reconsider, containing 200,000 signatures. Lowe's met with representatives of the petitioners for over an hour but declined their request.

Biography  Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Smart's career spanned over five decades. While in high school, he produced his first record with reggae instrumentalist Augustus Pablo and vocalist Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. The transition to recording engineering came when the Augustus Pablo's album Java was being recorded. Errol Thompson was the project engineer and Smart was taught how to record to sixteen-track tape machines and how to make rough mixes to two-track tapes. This was followed by working with King Tubby, and then for producer Bunny Lee, who gave him the nickname Prince Philip. He was in fact King Tubby's first trainee, recording and mixing such hits as \\"None Shall Escape\\" by Johnny Clarke, \\"Jah Love\\" by Yabby U, and most of Dr. Alimantado's albums. His HC&F; Recording Studio in Long Island was built in 1981 and opened in 1982. The first recording project was with the group Monyaka, titled \\"Go Deh Yaka\\", which was an instant hit, and reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. Since that time, the studio had several very successful projects such as Jah Life Productions, which featured such artists as Sister Carol, Scion Success, Barrington Levy and Carlton Livingston. Smart is also known for work he did with artists under labels other than his own, such as Island In the Sun Productions artist Horace Andy; Narrows Records artist Mr Easy; Donovan Germain Productions artists Audrey Hall, Owen Gray, Tanto Irie, and Johnny Osbourne; and Witty's Music Master Productions artists Shelly Thunder, Junior Wilson and Barrington Levy. With the 1990s came digital recording and the introduction of Pro Tools' two-track computer-recording program to the studio. The first hit recorded with Pro Tools was Dirtsman's \\"Hot This Year\\", which was released on Smart's TanYah records. He later produced \\"Rikers Island\\" by Cocoa Tea and Nardo Ranks. Later that year, Shaggy recorded \\"Mampie\\" with Smart; Red Fox and Screechie Dan's \\"Pose Off\\"; and \\"Shot Mek You Wiggle\\" by Junior Demus, which was later used in the film \\"Dancehall Queen\\". From 1993 until 1993 Shaggy recorded five albums from with Smart, including; \\"Boombastic\\" and \\"Hot Shot\\". As dance music got bigger in 2000, multitrack Digidesign Pro Tools TDM was in demand, along with 24-track tapes. Mixes such as \\"Headacke\\", \\"All Out\\", and \\"Blue Drawers\\" were synced with 24-track tape and Pro Tools technology to achieve fatness and warmth placing emphasis on digital mixing and editing features. Smart's early Pro Tools and analog technology knowledge gave him a cutting edge in the 1990s, which provided reggae artists with the ability to record Jamaican-quality sound in New York.  Death  Smart died on 25 February 2014, aged 53, in Port Washington, New York from pancreatic cancer.Campbell, Howard (2014) \\"US- based reggae producer Philip Smart dies\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 26 February 2014.

After working in a commercial filmed at Pellissippi State Community College, Landry was referred to WBIR-TV and hired in 1984 to work on The Heartland Series, a historical program on East Tennessee. Landry wrote and directed many of the episodes, as well as producing and appearing as a character. The series issued over 1400 short features and about 150 half-hour length programs, and won awards including four Emmy Awards, six Iris Awards from the National Association of Television Program Executives, two bronze medals and a silver from the New York International Film and Television Festival, and a Theodore Roosevelt Award for \\"Best Outdoor Documentary.\\" Landry received Emmy Awards for directing in 1999 and 2000, and in 1999 received an honorary Doctorate of Humanities degree from Lincoln Memorial University in recognition of his contributions to the humanities. In 2000 the play Einstein the Man was published through a grant and made available to middle and high school students in the state of Tennessee. In 2003, Landry's production of The George Washington Carver Project was also distributed by the Tennessee Department of Education to schools in Tennessee through the Carver Project website. In 2011 Landry published a book on East Tennessee history titled Appalachian Tales & Heartland Adventures. Personal life Landry currently lives in Blount County, Tennessee. Landry is the father of one son (Jack Landry) from his first marriage to Jessica Lynn Jones Landry. His wife Rebecca Carlock Webb \\"Becky\\" Landry died on April 19, 2012, at age 58.http://www.timesfreepress.com/obits/2012/apr/22/rebecca-landry/26079/ References External links *The Heartland Series videos *The Carver Project Category:Living people Category:1950 births Category:Male actors from Tennessee Category:American television directors Category:Emmy Award winners Category:20th-century American dramatists and playwrights Category:Writers from Tennessee Category:American theatre directors Category:People from Chattanooga, Tennessee Category:People from Blount County, Tennessee ","title":"Bill Landry"},{"id":"33931014","text":"The IBA is an important site for southern cassowaries The Wooroonooran Important Bird Area comprises some 5125 km2 of mainly forested land in the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Site, of Far North Queensland, Australia. Description The site encompasses the largest block of tropical rainforest in Australia, extending from just south of Port Douglas southwards past Cairns to Lucinda. It is dominated by the two granite massifs of Mounts Bartle Frere and Bellenden Ker, rising to about 1600 m and the highest peaks in northern Australia. Much of the area has previously been selectively logged, though the impact of such logging has been relatively minor and its ecological integrity remains largely intact. The site contains, or largely overlaps with, numerous protected areas, including the Barron Gorge, Danbulla, Dinden, Girringun, Japoon, Kirrama, Kuranda, Malaan, Mowbray, Murray Upper, Tully Gorge and Wooroonooran National Parks.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Wooroonooran. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-12-02. Wildlife The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a population of southern cassowaries. It also contains populations of tooth-billed and golden bowerbirds, lovely fairywrens, Macleay's, bridled and yellow-spotted honeyeaters, fernwrens, Atherton scrubwrens, mountain thornbills, chowchillas, Bower's shrike-thrushes, pied monarchs, Victoria's riflebirds and pale-yellow robins, all of which are endemic to the Queensland Wet Tropics. As well as the birds, the IBA is important for a range of locally endemic fauna including the green, Herbert River and lemur-like ringtail possums, Lumholtz's tree- kangaroo, the northern tinker and neglected frogs, and the bartle frere and stout barsided skinks.

Previously, he was Director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory (1998-2007), and Wolfson Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution. Since 2016, he has served as the foreign secretary of the Royal Society. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: Education He earned a Bachelor of Arts honours degree in 1970 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1974, from St John's College, University of Oxford. Career and research Catlow has developed and applied computer models to solid state and materials chemistry. By combining his computational methods with experiments, Catlow has made contributions to areas as diverse as catalysis and mineralogy. His approach has advanced understanding of how defects (missing or extra atoms) in the structure of solids can result in non- stoichiometric compounds. Such compounds have special electrical or chemical properties since their contributing elements are present in slightly different proportions to those predicted by chemical formulae. Catlow’s work has offered insight into mechanisms of industrial catalysts, especially involving microporous materials and metal oxides. In structural chemistry and mineralogy, simulation methods are now routinely used to predict the structures of complex solids and silicates respectively, following Catlow’s demonstrations of their power. Awards and honours In December 2014, Catlow was the winner of the Gerhard Ertl Lecture at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2004 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC). Catlow was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to leadership in science and research.

To create the book, Foer took Bruno Schulz's book The Street of Crocodiles and cut out the majority of the words. The publisher, Visual Editions, describes it as a \\"sculptural object.\\" Foer himself explains the writing process as follows: \\"I took my favorite book, Bruno Schulz’s Street of Crocodiles, and by removing words carved out a new story\\". Due to the physical difficulties involved in printing a book where most of the words have been cut out, Foer stated that he had to contact several different publishers before finding one who was willing to print it. The only printing office who could do the job was die Keure, from Belgium. He also said that due to the way the book had to be bound, it could not be produced in a hardcover edition. Reception The Times described it as \\"a true work of art.\\" Heather Wagner at Vanity Fair called it \\"a quietly stunning work of art.\\" Michael Faber, at The Guardian, said that while Foer showed a strong sense of poetry, the book was less successful as a work of fiction.

It was in circulation between 1989 and 2014. The headquarters of Zillo was in Lübeck. History The magazine was founded in 1989 under the name Zillostrierte, and three issues were published in A5 format. The format was changed to the double-size A4 format, and the name was shortened to Zillo in January 1990 after a four- month break in publication, and the magazine managed to gain circulation of about 50,000 readers. Despite a positive response and an increasing number of readers, the magazine was generating a monthly loss of 10,000 Deutsche Marks. At the end of 1990 the debt was over 100,000. To avoid bankruptcy, it was decided to increase the retail price. By 1992, circulation had increased to 70,000, and the magazine had become the mouthpiece of indie and goth culture as well as the Neue Deutsche Welle (\\"new German wave\\") movement, financed by its classifieds. In January 2014, a fire destroyed the entire editorial office, the logistics department and storage rooms of Zillo. The editorial staff announced on their website that the planned production of the February and March issues could not be realised. Later it was announced that the next issue would be released in 2015, but no new issues have been published since. Contents Music Zillo regularly included a sampler CD which contained both well-known acts and new, lesser-known bands. They regularly released compilation CDs since 1991. The compilation Zillo Dark Summer - Best Of Goth Open Airs 2000 was on the German Alternative Charts in 2000 for 8 weeks, peaking at number 1. The Zillo Festival 2001 compilation also charted on the DAC. Selected editions also included a second CD, a DVD, a calendar, or gimmicks like an ice scraper. The following sections appear in Zillo Music: { border=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\" * Alternative rock * Big beat * Crossover * Dark rock * Wave  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\" * Electronic body music (EBM) * Electro * Glam rock * Gothic rock * Grunge  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\" * Indie rock * Industrial * Madchester rave * Metal * Mittelalter rock  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\" * Neofolk * Post-rock * Neue Deutsche Härte * Synthpop * Trip hop } Comics An appreciable part of Zillo were the comic strips. The first comics were drawn by Nicole Scheriau and Marcus Zysk, from April 1993 and onward, often making fun of the New Wave and Goth movements. Scheriau was replaced in September 1995 with Uwe Roesch and his Dead comics, which, like Scheriau's, made fun of the Goth scene. Recently, there were 2-3 comics in every issue with death-specific icons that illustrate individual headings. Festival From 1993 to 1997, Zillo organized the Zillo Festival. First planned in 1990, the open-air concert didn't happen until 1993. It has been held in many places, starting in Durmersheim in 1993 and 1994, then Russelsheim in 1995. Between 1996 and 1999 it took place at the airport in Hildesheim. This annual music festival turned in to the M'era Luna Festival. Zillo Shop Over the years, the Zillo shop emerged as significant support for the magazine. At both festivals and the online store, Zillo sells such things as T-shirts, sample CDs, mugs, watches, rear window stickers, and accessories with dark, quirky motifs. The shop includes over 100 death-themed images.

This knowledge belonged to the Aztecs, Incas, Mayans, and Anasazi, and covered two continents. History An analysis of Ancient American Engineering works shows that the engineers adhered strictly to two important principles: the efficient use of the resources available and the effectiveness of a project design. Of the resources available then, the tools were quite rudimentary: none of iron, some of copper and other metals, but mostly of wood and stone. Nor was there any sophisticated means of transportation - only animals for carrying cargo and, even these, only in certain regions. The manual labor, abundant when mobilized by a strong socio- political organization, produced the bulk of the work. Another abundant resource then, compared to now, was time. The construction of many ancient works seems to have been prolonged for decades, if not centuries. Buildings Adobe structures were constructed with bricks created from sand, clay, and water, with some fibrous or organic material, shaped using frames and dried in the sun. Stone houses, arranged in villages or towns, were built in caves or on sheer rock canyon walls. In response to the warm summer weather, they used the overhanging lip of the cliff to block off the high summer sun, so it was much cooler and more comfortable. They were built in places that were easily defensible. The Mayan pyramids rise as high as twenty- story buildings. All of the buildings are aligned with the stars and the solar system from precise survey points in the nearby mountain range, using an advanced understanding of mathematics, geometry and astronomy. The City-state Tenochtitlan was connected to the mainland by causeways leading in and out of the city. These causeways were broken up by bridges that controlled the movement of foot traffic. The city was interlaced with a series of canals, so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via canoe. Levees were used to control the flow of water surrounding the city. Two double aqueducts, similar to Roman aqueducts, provided the city with fresh water. Irrigation Ancient Americans built canals in order to irrigate crops and carry a steady supply of water to areas where water was not normally available. The canals used positioning in order to allow gravity to move the water from its source to the crops. The slopes allowed the water to travel easily and reliably to the crops in order to make sure they had the water they needed in order to flourish. The water that travelled along the canals was drawn from small streams. Crops had been planted in areas that were lower than the rivers although they were not naturally wet. This showed that the civilizations which utilized the canals were organized enough to notice their surroundings and use the geography to their advantage, rather than simply choosing random areas to plant their crops. Although the canals only date back by as much as 6,700 years, many scientists believe that there may have been an organized system of irrigation as much as 9,000 to 10,000 years ago although they feel that evidence of these very early canals will be hard to find.

Under Weifenbach, the club's greatest success came in 1986, when it reached the semi finals of the play-offs. In its current incarnation, the club is known as the Iserlohn Roosters and plays in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. After resigning from his position as chairman in 1991, Weifenbach had little involvement with the club and ice hockey, rarely visiting the stadium. He was however well received when attending the 40th anniversary of ice hockey in Iserlohn and the crowd asked for him to take to the ice, calling him by his nickname, Big Heinz. His financial activities as chairman of the club eventually resulted in him serving a prison term, but he is, especially in Iserlohn, still regarded as somebody that tried to keep ice hockey in the town alive, and consequently still enjoys a good reputation. Weifenbach had privately employed many of the clubs ice hockey players through 13 different companies but, in many cases, had failed to pay taxes and mandatory social insurance premiums. Owing more than DM2 million in taxes, he was sentenced to four years in jail in 1993, of which he served 27 month.Sitzen für das „Grüne Buch“ Focus, published: 1993, accessed: 3 December 2011Iserlohn Roosters www.eishockeyplace.org, accessed: 3 December 2011 During his time as chairman, he invested a great deal of his own money in the club and was described by the sentencing judge as an \\"Ice hockey nut\\" ().Iserlohn Roosters: \\"Wenn Träume siegen lernen\\" www.derwesten.de, published: 16 March 2008, accessed: 3 December 2011 In the last years of his life, Weifenbach suffered from dementia and required permanent care.Gaddafis deutscher Club TAZ, published: 1 March 2011, accessed: 3 December 2011 He died on 21 February 2015. The Green Book An ECD Iserlohn shirt with advertising for the Green Book, exhibited in the German Ice Hockey Hall of Fame. Weifenbach's club, the ECD Iserlohn, had been rumored to be in financial trouble and to make under- hand payments to players for a number of years. A number of players had previously been investigated by the German tax department for this reason. In the summer of 1987, ECD found itself repeatedly rejected for an Ice hockey Bundesliga license and when it was eventually granted, two weeks before the start of the season, it was only because the other nine clubs had pushed the German Ice Hockey Federation, the DEB, to grant it under the promise that they would not demand compensation if the club did fold during the season. At the time, the club was reported to owe the tax department US$3.4 million. The tax department did eventually demand outstanding tax repayments and, when they were not forthcoming, had the club declared insolvent. Following this, Weifenbach declared that there was no need to panic as he had a sponsor who was willing to support the club with DM10 million over the coming years. The sponsor turned out to be the organisation marketing Gaddafi's Green Book, the Center for the Studies and Researches of the Green Book, and ECD Iserlohn, on the 4 December 1987, took to the ice against SB Rosenheim with advertising for the Green Book on its shirts. Reportedly, the club received US$900,000 for the advertising of the book on its shirts and in its arena. The DEB reacted promptly, banning the club from using the Green Book as a shirt sponsor on the grounds that religious or political advertising was illegal in German sports. For the following game, the ECD returned without a shirt sponsor. It was also the club's last game as the administrators deregistered it from competition. Weifenbach however continued his fight for the club's survival, organising a flight to Libya for himself and 25 journalists to meet Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi signed copies of the Green Book for the visitors but may have known very little about the deal, asking, according to one of the accompanying journalists, what the name of the tennis club is he was sponsoring.Heinz Weifenbach eishockey-magazin.de, Original: Die Droge Eishockey by Günter Klein, accessed: 3 December 2011 Weifenbach also took the case to the internal tribunal of the DEB who ruled partly in his favour. The club was allowed to continue its existence, now under the new name of ECD Sauerland, but not in the Bundesliga. Instead, if it fulfilled certain requirements, it would be allowed to enter the promotion round to the Bundesliga. In the end, Weifenbach was not able to raise a new team in time, the majority of the ECD Iserlohn players having left the club with the insolvency, and Sauerland was forced to restart play in the third division Oberliga.Klein, p. 92 The affair caused a rift between the Bundesliga clubs and the DEB, with some of them advocating a break away league which would have included Austrian and Italian clubs. Eventually, seven years later, this did happen, when the Deutsche Eishockey Liga was formed, but without any non-German teams. Weifenbach continued his connections to Libya in the following year, when he advertised on cars of the then government owned Deutsche Post for a publishing company he owned, with the company's only published book being the Green Book, a move that, according to his former lawyer Ingo Graumann, caused embaressement to the German government and consequently caused him to be sentenced to jail. At least two of the shirts used in the game against Rosenheim may still survive. One was donated by Czech ice hockey player Robert Simon to the Deutsches Sport & Olympia Museum in Cologne in August 2011. Simon, who played 108 games for Iserlohn, had worn the shirt during the game but actually had to exchange it back with a collector to be able to donate it to the museum.Eishockey-Trikot mit Werbung für Gaddafis \\"Grünes Buch\\" übergeben Deutsches Sport & Olympia Museum website, published: 24 August 2011, accessed: 4 December 2011 A second shirt, different in color combination, is currently exhibited at the German Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in Augsburg.

It originally aired on December 1, 2011 on NBC. In the episode, Jeff takes foosball lessons from Shirley to take on a group of rowdy students. The game brings back childhood memories for both of them, and they discover a previously unknown connected past. Meanwhile, Annie accidentally breaks Abed's limited-edition The Dark Knight DVD and stages a break-in to their apartment to hide it. Abed suits up as Batman himself to find the purported burglars. The episode was written by Chris Kula and directed by Anthony Russo. It received positive critical reviews. Plot While the group are hanging out in the student lounge on Friday, a group of German students annoys Jeff (Joel McHale) with their rowdiness while playing foosball. He confronts them and they promise to stop playing if he can score a point on them. He tries but fails, and the German students mock him. Later in the night, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) encounters Jeff practicing foosball at the student lounge. She impresses him by showing him some moves, and he solicits her training. Although initially reluctant due to the \\"dark nature\\" of the game, Shirley agrees to it. They practice the next day, during which Shirley brings out her ultra-competitive streak. The German trio show up again and agree to a game with Jeff and Shirley on Monday with the losers never getting to use the foosball table again. Over dinner, Shirley recalls an incident from her childhood in which she (then known as \\"Big Cheddar\\") trashed a boy (derisively called \\"Tinkletown\\") at foosball and made him pee his pants by jabbing him with the foosball bar in the crotch. Jeff reveals that he was Tinkletown and storms out. Later, Shirley asks Jeff to the student lounge to talk. They end up playing a furious game of foosball, releasing their emotions and opening up to each other. Meanwhile when Annie (Alison Brie) is cleaning the apartment, she accidentally steps on Abed's (Danny Pudi) limited-edition The Dark Knight DVD. She plans to secretly replace it, but Troy (Donald Glover) warns against it, asking her to confess. When Abed returns, Annie stages a break-in, making Abed believe that the DVD was stolen. A policeman arrives at the scene but finds no signs of forced entry and concedes that if stolen the DVD will be impossible to recover. Abed concludes that the break-in was an inside job carried out by the landlord, Rick, since Rick has the keys and dressed as the Joker for Halloween. Abed suits up as Batman and rappels down through the window to Rick's room. Troy and Annie follow him. Abed confronts Rick about a stolen item, to which Rick replies \\"in the closet.\\" Troy and Annie open Rick's closet and find it full of stolen women's shoes. Annie also plants the broken DVD there, framing Rick for stealing it. The policeman arrives again to sort out the mess. Back at the apartment, Abed, as Batman, forgives Annie for the mishap but warns her not to tell Abed as he won't be so forgiving. On Monday, Jeff and Shirley face off with the Germans at foosball. However, they perform a trick to make the ball land right in the middle of the foosball table where bar mounted figures can't reach. While the Germans frantically try to kick the ball, Jeff and Shirley simply walk off together. The final scene depicts them walking hand-in-hand as children again. The bumper scene depicts one of Leonard's Youtube frozen pizza reviews, which includes a Chuck Lorre-style vanity card. Production \\"Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism\\" was written by Chris Kula, his first writing credit for the series. It was directed by Anthony Russo, his 14th directing credit. The animation sequence was made by Titmouse, Inc. It was directed by Grif Kimmins, animated by Parker Simmons and produced by Ben Kalina. Nick Kroll guest- starred as Juergen, the leader of the German foosball group. The episode was originally titled \\"Indoor Sports with Christian Bale\\".Audio commentary for the episode by Chris Kula, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Joel McHale on the Season 3 DVD. Writing The episode featured a rare pairing between Jeff and Shirley for the main storyline. Whereas Britta has developed more into Jeff's conscience, Shirley is the spiritual opposite of Jeff. The Jeff/Shirley storyline is also a television trope where two characters find out that they knew each other as children. This device has been used in television series such as Mad About You, The Simpsons, and Fringe. In the second storyline, when Annie tries to secretly replace Abed's broken DVD, Troy reminds her: \\"Do you know how many sitcoms have tried the secretly replace an item thing? Abed does.\\" Abed reprises his impression of Christian Bale as Batman. Annie, usually the voice of reason, undergoes a role reversal as the troublemaker. Themes The main storyline shows that while Jeff and Shirley are opposite in many ways, both have morphed into their present personas under very similar circumstances. When they were children, Shirley was a mean foosball player; Jeff used the game to fill his loneliness and inability to connect with people. Shirley behaves as a pious woman to erase memories of her past as a bully, while Jeff's too-cool-to-care attitude developed after being a victim of bullying during his childhood. Despite Shirley feeling bad about bullying Jeff and his bitterness about it, the episode demonstrates that the process of growing up is often about giving up on painful experiences and realizing an ability to rise above them with the help of friends and family. Meanwhile, in the second storyline, Abed initially used the Batman persona as a way to deal with a painful situation. In the end, he, Troy and Annie resolve the situation maturely and take a collective leap into adulthood. Reception Ratings In its original American broadcast on December 1, 2011, the episode was viewed by approximately 3.74 million people, with a Nielsen rating/share of 1.7/5 in the 18–49 demographic. Reviews \\"Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Nick Kroll's guest appearance drew near universal acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the Jeff/Shirley storyline \\"wound up being much more successful than the [Annie/Abed storyline]... in rare combinations like we got tonight, we can see that Joel McHale and Yvette Nicole Brown work very well together.\\" As for the Annie/Abed storyline, he said \\"it didn't seem much different, or better, than the many, many, many other sitcoms that have done the 'secretly replace a priceless broken item' thing before it. Not unfunny, but a whole lot flimsier than what 'Community' is capable of so much of the time.\\" Ology's Emily Cheever said \\"'Foosball And Nocturnal Vigilantism' was one of the best episodes of Community, nay television, I've ever seen... Community has the reputation that it's hard to get new viewers due to irreverence and self- referencial humor. It's hard to always appreciate the benefits of Community when you don't know what's going on. But this episode filled my living room with belly laughs from start to finish.\\" Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com said the episode was \\"simple and sweet... Tonight’s episode shows that while Community is certainly adept at going off the wall, when you take away the crazy ideas, it still retains a base of genuine humor and solid, emotional human relationships.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A-', saying \\"Community has always been known as a clever show, and that’s because what the show throws at you upfront is that cool cleverness, that sense that it’s just too awesome for words. But when you start to dig down a bit, you see that what it also is achingly sincere.\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic gave \\"Foosball\\" a 4.5/5 rating, saying it was \\"full of love and awesome quotes.\\" Robert Canning of IGN said \\"[Community] clearly has the feel of an already great series truly hitting its stride. Fingers crossed that NBC has been watching these episodes and is starting to think the same thing.\\" References External links * \\"Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism\\" at NBC.com * * Category:Community (season 3) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism"},{"id":"33931376","text":"The Mechanicsville Fire Station Number 5 is the oldest active fire station in Knoxville, Tennessee.

( 1948 ) Resolving social confl icts: Selected papers on group dynamics (G. W. Lewin, Ed.). New York, NY : Harper & Row. Lewin , K. ( 1952 ). Field theory in social sciences: Selected theoretical  Four basic assumptions of interdependence theory   1. The principle of structure (the situation)  All interactions are set within the context of their given situation (known in Interdependence theory as structure). In order to best analyze this factor, Interdependence theory presents a taxonomy of situations that includes the six dimensions listed below. A key concept with the Principle of Structure is Affordance, or what the situation affords (makes possible) for the individuals within the interaction. * Six dimensions of structure: # Degree/level of dependence. This dimension focuses on the level of reliance that one member of an interaction has on another member of the interaction. This dimension is characterized by the following types of control, a) Actor Control- the impact of individual's behavior on the individual's outcomes, b) Partner Control- the impact of each individual behavior on the outcomes of the other individuals in the interaction, c) Joint Control- the joint impact of each individual's behavior on each individual's outcome.Van Lange, P.A., & Balliet, D. (2014). Interdependence Theory. American Psychological Association. DOI:10.4135/9781446201022.n39 An example of this would be if person A is able to achieve a positive outcome regardless of the actions of person B, then person A is high in Actor Control. If person A is dependent on the actions of person B to determine if he/she achieves a positive outcome, person A is high in Partner Control. If person A and person B are dependent on each other to achieve a positive outcome, they are high in Joint Control. # Mutuality of dependence. This dimension focuses on the level (and equality of) dependence each individual within the interaction has with the other individual(s) within the interaction. As person A become more dependent on person B, person B gains greater control over person A. # Covariation of interest. This dimension analyzes the level of gratification each individual within an interaction receives based on the outcome produced. This dimension could range from completely corresponding levels of gratification (coordination) to conflicting gratification (zero-sum) (or any range between these extremes). An example of corresponding levels of gratification would be a situation in which person A and person B both simply attempt to achieve outcomes in their own best interests, but in so doing also achieve outcomes in the best interest of the other. An example of conflicting gratification is a situation were all outcomes that are positive to one individual are completely negative to the other individual in the interaction. # Basis of dependence. This dimension focuses on the means of influence that one member of an interaction has on the another member of the interaction. This dimension is characterized by the following types of control, a) Actor Control- the impact of individual's behavior on the individual's outcomes, b) Partner Control- the impact of each individual behavior on the outcomes of the other individuals in the interaction, c) Joint Control- the joint impact of each individual's behavior on each individual's outcome. Examples of means of influence include promises, threats, reliance on social/moral norms, unilateral action, and turn-taking. # Temporal structure. Temporal structure focuses on the effects that timing and sequential process have on situations. Key concepts in this dimension include, 1) Situational Selection, or the \\"movement from one situation to another, bringing partners to a new situation that differs from the prior situation in terms of behavioral options or outcomes\\" (Van Lange & Balliet, 2014, p. 71), as was well as what Axelrod coined 2) \\"The shadow of the future\\" (Van Lange & Balliet, 2014, p. 79),Axelrod, R. (1984). The evolution of cooperation. New York, NY: Basic Books. or long term strategy of cooperating in anticipation of future reciprocal rewards from the other individual in future interactions. # Information availability. Information availability focuses on the amount of information individuals have concerning the other individual's motives, potential iteration outcomes, and the potential future opportunities any given interaction may bring about. This dimension suggests that misunderstanding is often rooted in low levels of information availability. An example of this would be if person A has certain information about the goals and motivations of person B, person A's actions will be effected differently than if that information was uncertain.  2. The principle of transformation (what people make of the situation) Transformation is a psychological process through which individuals consider possible outcomes that result from both their action and the action of others, and weigh these outcomes against possible actions and courses of actions (Rewards and costs). * Rewards and costs ** Interdependence theory stipulates that an ideal relationship is characterized with high levels of rewards and low levels of costs. Rewards are \\"exchanged resources that are pleasurable and gratifying,\\" while costs are \\"exchanged resources that result in a loss or punishment.\\"Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32–43. There are different types of rewards and costs discussed in this theory. This theory distinguishes between four types of rewards and costs. These types are as follows: emotional, social, instrumental, and opportunity. *** Emotional **** Emotional rewards and costs are the positive and negative feelings, respectively, that are experienced in a relationship. These types of rewards and costs are especially pertinent to close relationships.Guerrero, L.K., Anderson, P.A., & Afifi, W.A. (2007). Close encounters: Communication in relationships. *** Social **** Social rewards and costs are those related with a person's social appearance and the ability to interact in social environments. Social rewards deal with the positive aspect of a person's social appearance and the enjoyable social situations in which one must engage. On the other hand, social costs are those that relate to the negative aspect of a person's social appearance and the uninteresting social situations to which a person must attend. *** Instrumental **** Instrumental rewards and costs deal with activities and/or tasks in a relationship. Instrumental rewards are those that are obtained when a person's partner is proficient in handling tasks, such as getting all the laundry finished. Instrumental costs are just the opposite; they occur when a person's relationship partner causes unnecessary work or the partner impedes the other's progress in a task, such as one person in a relationship not doing any of the housework. *** Opportunity **** Opportunity rewards and costs are associated with the opportunities that arise in relationships. Opportunity rewards are those gains that a person is able to receive in their relationship, which they would not be able to receive on their own. Opportunity costs occur when a person must give up something that they normally would not for the sake of the relationship. * Outcome Transformation. Outcome transformation is the concept that individuals may take into account their own outcomes as well as the outcome for the other individual in the interaction. There are orientations that individuals take when considering outcomes for the other individual in an interaction (known as nonidividualistic orientations of outcome transformation). These nonidividualistic orientations of outcome transformation include the following: ** Cooperation (MaxJoint): maximizes joint outcomes ** Equality (MinDiff): minimizes differences in outcomes ** Altruism (MaxOther): maximizes positive outcomes for others ** Aggression (MinOther) minimizes positive outcomes for others  3. The principle of interaction (SABI: I = ƒ[A, B, S]) The Principle of Interaction (also referred to as the SABI model) is used to assess the variable that affect any given iteration. This model states that Interactions (I) are a function (ƒ) of the situation, Person A's (A) motives, traits, and actions, plus Person B's (B) motives, traits, and actions (I = ƒ[A, B, S]). There are several factors that individuals bring to the Interaction. They are their consideration of Outcomes, Comparison Level, and Comparison Level for Alternatives. * Outcomes ** With every relationship there is an outcome. These outcomes are determined by comparing the amount of rewards present in a relationship versus the amount of costs present. \\"According to interdependence theory, people mentally account for rewards and costs so they can evaluate the outcome of their relationship as either positive or negative.\\" The outcome is determined to be positive when the rewards outweigh the costs in a relationship. Conversely, the outcome is negative when the costs outweigh the rewards. * Comparison level (CL) ** Interdependence theory also takes into account comparison level. This involves the expectation of the kinds of outcomes a person expects to receive in a relationship. These expectations are 'compared' to a person's past relationships and current observations of others' relationships. \\"Satisfaction depends on expectation, which is shaped by prior experience, especially gripping events of the recent past.\\"Thibaut, J. & Kelly, H. (Date Unk.). Social Exchange Theory. A first look at communiation history. retrieved from http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/socialexchange.pdf A person will have a high comparison level, if all the relationships that they have been exposed to are happy. Therefore, to determine whether or not someone is in a satisfying relationship, it is necessary to consider both the rewards and costs evident in that relationship as well as that person's own comparison level. * Comparison Level for Alternative (CL-alt) ** Comparison level correlated with the rewards and costs of a relationship determine satisfaction and commitment for a particular person in a relationship. However, there are some situations where people may be committed, but not have a satisfying relationship or they may be satisfied in their relationship, but not committed to it. Thus, the quality of alternatives helps people understand the 'alternatives' they have outside of their current relationship. Alternatives can be any other option rather than the one currently held. When people have good alternatives, they tend to be less committed to their relationships. By contrast, when people have poor alternatives, they tend to be highly committed to their relationships.Crawford, D. W., Feng, D., Fischer, J.L., & Diana L.K., (2003). The influence of love, equity, and alternatives on commitment in romantic relationships. Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal, 13, 253–271.  4. The principle of adaptation Adaption refers to the process by where exposure to similar situations gives rise to habitual responses which have been proven to result in (on average) positive outcomes. In addition to the type of exposure based condition just described, adaptation can result based on rules of social norms. For example, person A might enter into a situation that is similar to situations he/she has experienced before, based on these previous experiences person A's actions are guided in a way in which to receive the same positive outcomes as the previous situations produced. Similarly, social norms guide individuals toward specific, society approved, actions.  Academic and practical applications  Interdependence theory has been used by academics to \\"analyze group dynamics, power and dependence, social comparison, conflict and cooperation, attribution and self- presentation, trust and distrust, emotions, love and commitment, coordination and communication, risk and self-regulation, performance and motivation, social development, and neuroscientific model of social interaction\\" (Van Lange & Balliet, 2014, p. 67).Rusbult, C.

Higgins (Eds.), Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles (pp. 540-561). New York, NY: Guilford Press. In addition, the theory provides a practical framework for understanding the underlying psychological factors that motivate other individuals in which you interact (in both personal and professional settings), as well as providing a framework for understanding the underlying psychological factors that motivate your own actions when interacting with others.

History  The station was built by the Frankfurt–Bebra railway as the station of the former county town of the district of Gelnhausen. Services commenced on the Hanau Ost–Wächtersbach section on 1 May 1867. Buildings  The station building and the rest of the station buildings are now mostly classified as cultural monuments under the Hessian Monument Protection Act. Entrance building  Station, track side The entrance building was built in a Romanesque Revival style of Buntsandstein (coloured sandstone) and so added to the historic buildings of the Hohenstaufen town of Gelnhausen, which include the most famous Romanesque building in the city, the Gelnhausen Palace (Pfalz Gelnhausen), but also the Romanesque House (Romanisches Haus). The architect Paul Rowald also designed Bad Hersfeld station with the same layout and both buildings are built in the same style. The building was built in 1882/83 and is therefore a structure of the \\"second generation\\" of structural engineering on the line. The station building is symmetrically designed on an H-shaped floor plan. On the street side the facade is dominated by three pointed gables, the middle gable is omitted from the design of the facade on the track side. A \\"princely pavilion\\" (Fürstenpavillon) was built to the west of the main building with three bay windows; there is also a detached toilet block built in the Romanesque Revival style east of the main building. Other buildings  The buildings in the station area are the house of the track supervisor (Bahnmeister) from 1868 (a building of the \\"first generation\\" of structural engineering on the line), a freight-handling facility from the period around 1870 and a water tower—architecturally out of harmony with the towers of the Gelnhausen town wall—from 1937. Operations The station has a home platform (a single-sided outer platform next to the station building) and a two-sided island platform. At the western end of the home platform, there is a bay platform, where services on the Lahn-Kinzig Railway to and from Büdingen and Gießen start and end. The other three platform tracks can be used only by trains on the Kinzig Valley line, which can run from here to Hanau-Wolfgang at 200 km/h. Local trains are often held at Gelnhausen station so that Intercity- Express and Intercity trains can pass them. Gelnhausen station is now only used by local and regional services and has great importance for commuter traffic from the Vogelsberg and Spessart hills of the Rhine-Main region. Previously two more lines operated to Gelnhausen station: *The standard gauge Freigericht Light Railway of the Gelnhäusen District Railway started here from 1904 until 1963. *The narrow gauge Spessart Railway also began here and operated from 1895 to 1951. The railway facilities of both trains were immediately south of Gelnhausen \\"state station”. From 1930, both railways had a common platform, which was connected by an underground passage to the platforms of the state railway. The infrastructure for the lines at the station has been demolished and has been replaced by parking lots.

Standard police issue firearms are carried on board and the vessel itself has provision for fitting mounted weapons in the future. Nemesis was part of the support patrol for the 2009 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. In 2010, the NSW Police was criticised for only operating the ship for 403 hours in 2009. Deployments were subsequently increased to 80 hours per month.

It introduces actor Kunal Khemu, in his debut film as an adult actor. It also stars Emraan Hashmi, Smilie Suri, Deepal Shaw, Amrita Singh and Ashutosh Rana. The film follows a young man who sets out to exact revenge upon the porn industry after his wife commits suicide due to the footage of their first night getting released on internet. Kalyug released on 9 December 2005. It featured the fictional porn website which inspired a real website of the same name. Plot 18 years ago, the Dhar family, consisting of Pushkaran (Yatin Karyekar) and his son, Kunal (Kunal Khemu), were forced to leave Kashmir by terrorists. Pushkaran and Kunal re-locate to Bombay, where they live in a small room. This is where Kunal grows up, and gets a job at a gym. Then one day, the police knock on his door, informing him that his father had lost his hold from a crowded local train, fallen, and instantly killed. A devastated Kunal arranges his father's funeral, and before he could reconcile to living alone, his relatives contact him from Jammu, informing him that his father had promised to look after a young woman named Renuka (Smiley Suri). Kunal agrees to fulfill his father's promise. When Renuka arrives, she finds out about the untimely death, and wants to return, but ticket reservation forces her to stay with Kunal for a week. It is this week that changes their lives, for they fall in love and get married. They stay the first night at a hotel, where they encounter Johnny (Ashutosh Rana) whom tells the manager to book them into the honeymoon suite. It is there where they consummate their marriage. However, a few nights later, police storm into their house and arrest the two for interrogation. It is revealed that their intimite night at the hotel was secretly recorded and uploaded onto a porn website, with the video receiving many views. Kunal realizes that Johnny was responsible for having them exploited. Meanwhile, Renuka is forced by the police to sign the papers and testify against him, making her believe Kunal was responsible for this. As she is led out, she encounters Kunal who tells her the truth and begs for her not to sign those papers. All these feelings of guilt, embarrassment, and confusion proves too much for Renuka as she then jumps of the ledge and commits suicide in front of Kunal. Kunal is then sent to prison as he refuses to admit the false charge. Kunal is later able to prove himself innocent and decides to track down Johnny and his team to get revenge. It is revealed that Johnny is working for a businesswoman Simi Roy, who secretly is the porn-website creator living in Zurich, Switzerland. Kunal leaves for Zurich in order to take revenge against Johnny and Simi Roy. In Zurich, Kunal comes across Ali (Emraan Hashmi) a modern-day punk, who runs an adults only shop. In his shop, Kunal sees a magazine featuring a pornstar he had seen on the same website where his and Renuka's video was featured. He uses Ali's help to track down the girl. Kunal and Ali track the girl down in a bar where she is a singer, suddenly Kunal finds a young girl being held hostage and beats up the bodyguards but he gets hit by Simi Roy's car. The next day, Kunal overhears Simi fighting with her abusive daughter Tanya about being drunk and doing sexual activities with her girlfriend Jessica. Kunal then asks Simi about the blue film porn website but Simi lies to him and explains that she has nothing to do with it. The girl is revealed to be Anny (Deepal Shaw) and reveals to Kunal that after her hometown got destroyed in the Gujarat earthquake killing her parents, her uncle sells her to Johnny and his friend Vick for money against her will. She tries to escape but is quickly captured and forced to enter the porn industry to be exploited. Kunal and Ali lure Johnny and his goons into a trap and start a furious fight. Ali is fatally stabbed by Johnny, but is able to seize the same blade and kill Johnny and his men. Before dying, Ali reveals that Simi Roy is the main mastermind behind the pornography website and also runs the red light district in Zurich. Kunal asks Tanya for help and in return he would help her ruin Simi's life. Simi who is watching the TV seeing her own daughter on her porn website feels devastated and is confronted by Kunal and Tanya where Tanya kills Simi. Kunal is free of charges and starts a new life with Anny.

Usually set by state fish and game departments, the protected slot limit prohibits the harvest of fish where the lengths, measured from the snout to the end of the tail, fall within the protected interval.Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. \\"Minnesota Fishing Regulations 2011\\". 2011. Print. For example, on a body of water where there is a protected slot limit on largemouth bass between , largemouth between those lengths may not be harvested.\\"Connecticut’s Bass Management Lakes\\". PDF. Accessed 9/25/2011. URL: http://www.cr.gov/dep/lib/dep/fishing/freshwater/bassbroc.pdf In this example largemouth bass shorter than and longer than may be removed from the water and kept for personal use in accordance with local fishing regulations. Slot limits are based on the principle that bass populations exhibit different habitat requirements during different phases of their lives. Slot limits focus on protecting one segment of the life history which can influence overall fishing success. A minimum landing size is a similar regulation in other areas. Purpose Generally, the purpose behind the implementation of protected slot limits is to improve the angling opportunities in a particular body or bodies of water. Protected slot limits are most often used to regulate the harvest from waters where natural reproduction of the concerned fish species occurs. The protected slot limit is set in such a way that it protects the size of those fish deemed most important to the species spawning success in that fishery. With the size of the most sexually productive fish protected from harvest it is likely that an increased number will spawn during a given year and hence lead to more naturally produced individuals. The effort to increase the number of fish through natural reproduction mitigates the need for artificial stocking of a species to provide for a viable recreational fishery. In addition to improving natural reproduction success the protected slot limit can also serve to improve the average catchable size of a protected species. This is of particular concern in recreational fisheries where the practice of catch and release is not prevalent. The slot limit protects those fish that evade harvest until their size exceeds that of the lower end of the protected slot. They are then protected from harvest until they exceed the maximum size within the protected slot. Fish within this size range are protected from harvest during the time when their size would make them desirable by anglers. In such a scenario the protection of large numbers of medium-sized fish translates into a higher success rate of those that exceed the slot limit. Hence, the protected slot limit increases the amount of fish that reach the large sizes sought by sport anglers. This model assumes that the lake or stream in question contains a forage base suitable to support fish of this size. Challenges The issue of protected slot limits, in some cases, is marked in controversy. The protected slot limit and the angler’s desire to harvest fish can be in conflict. The main challenge lies in the economic, ecological, and social factors that fisheries managers must consider when implementing harvest regulations such as protected slot limits. Take, for example, the situation involving Lake Mille Lacs in central Minnesota. Anglers spend millions of dollars and travel countless miles to fish for Lake Mille Lacs walleye (Sander vitreus) which is highly sought after for its table fare as well as its sporting qualities. In the case of Lake Mille Lacs there has long been a protected slot limit for walleye. In 2002, the slot limit was from . At the time, state fishing regulations stated that on Lake Mille Lacs an angler could keep four walleyes with only one walleye over allowed, and all walleyes within the protected slot limit of must be immediately released. The protected slot limit worked so well, in a sense, that anglers soon found it difficult to catch harvestable sizes of walleye and they were catching an overabundance of slot-sized fish. Many anglers have become frustrated by the lack of \\"eater\\" sized walleye. The intense protection of this size class of fish caused a sharp decline in the natural available forage base for walleyes.Sternberg, Dick. \\"The Mille Lacs Fish Management Plan: Threat to Minnesota's Premier Walleye Fishery\\". 2002. PDF. Accessed 9/25/2011. URL: http://www.perm.org/pdfs/TreatyManagement.pdf The result was a large number of unhealthy and underweight slot-sized walleyes in the fishery. This case represents an exception to the outcomes common to the implementation of protected slot limits. However, it does illustrate the objectives fisheries managers must consider when devising protected slot limits. Managers must balance the health of the fishery, trophy fish potential, and desired angler harvest. Ways to protect fish populations When an angler is fishing, he or she must measure the fish caught to make sure it meets the state's wildlife and fisheries requirements. Every state has their own limits for fish that are native to their ecosystems. If the fish meets the requirements then the angler is allowed to keep the fish, but can only keep a certain amount of fish of that species. Besides a slot limit there are other ways and limits that officials can use to protect a fish population. #Minimum size limits- important when higher levels of reproduction are required. #Creel limits- used to prevent the harvest of too many fish at once, allowing more fish to reach larger sizes. Guist Creek Lake is an example of a lake that has decided that a creel limit was necessary for there native fish species. #Closed seasons- used to help protect fish during their spawning seasons. If a given area puts a closed season into action an angler is not allowed to fish this area during specified times of the year. Mode of action As a largemouth bass grows they must reach a certain size to enter the reproductive stage. These fish reproduce with more frequency during a certain age and weight in their lifespan. The desired slot limit for largemouth bass Before a slot limit can be put into action, four things must be taken into consideration in order to make sure no harm is done to the ecosystem: Growth rate Growth rate can be defined as how long it takes for a fish to reach a given size. Even though growth rate differs from lake to lake, an average largemouth bass can grow up to in less than three years, which is considered rapid growth. Recruitment Recruitment is defined as the number of young fish that live to adulthood. Lakes with 20 to 40% coverage of aquatic plants usually have high bass recruitment, whereas lakes with little shoreline cover often have low to intermediate recruitment. If a lake has a high recruitment, this is a good situation for a state to use the slot limit because it will help control the number of small fish in a population. When the recruitment is low, this is where a state would use the minimum-size limit to control the fish population. Mortality Mortality rate is the percent of fish in a given lake that die. To find the true mortality rate of a lake, officials must divide the number of fish harvested plus fish killed from hooks, then divide that number by the number of fish that die each year. Measurements After the growth rate, recruitment rate, and mortality rate have been determined, if all three factors are met, the correct measurements must be chosen to insure that no harm is done to the surrounding ecosystem. If a slot limit is used correctly, not only will the a fish population benefit from this; but the surrounding ecosystem potentially could gain some benefits from a slot limit. Benefits Slot limits can be very beneficial to fish species along with their ecosystem. One benefit from slot limits is that it reduces the amount of competitive pressure between fish the same size. Not only will it reduce competition, but it will also result in a healthier fish population since the slot limit doesn't allow anglers to keep fish that produce the most eggs during their spawning season. Since the fish are healthier and larger, this will bring more jobs and tourists to a town, which will result in the city's revenue to rise. Example of a slot limit The Lake Fork Reservoir in Texas is known for its largemouth bass. A slot limit was introduced in the early 1900s in hopes of bettering the chances of catching a trophy bass. The regulations are: # Largemouth bass are subject to a slot limit. # Bass and shorter and and longer can be harvested. # Daily bag limit of five fish # One fish can be or longer.

In general it is a large plant that grows in clumps up to two meters wide. It produces a rosette of many narrow leaves each up to long but only wide. The grasslike leaf blades are thick, rough, and serrated. There is no aboveground stem; the leaves grow from a woody underground caudex. When the plant flowers it produces a scape up to tall. The inflorescence is a panicle of flowers with tiny white tepals. The species is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants; occasionally there are flowers with both male and female parts functional. The fruit is a papery, three-sided capsule about half a centimeter long and wide. This plant grows in dry habitat types, such as desert grasslands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and chaparral. It is a dominant plant species in a number of ecosystems. It may grow alongside oaks, pines, and manzanitas. The region experiences a bimodal pattern of precipitation, with rainy seasons occurring in November through April and again during the summer. Wildfire is not uncommon. The plant resprouts from its caudex after its aboveground parts burn. Sacahuista herbage is flammable, increasing the local intensity of fires when it ignites. Sacahuista provides food for animals such as white-tailed deer. However, it is poisonous to sheep and goats, and less so to cattle. Sheep fed parts of the plant have been noted to experience impaction of the rumen and liver toxicity. In an experimental setting the plant also appears to be toxic to rats and chukar partridges, resulting in symptoms such as loss of coordination and diarrhea when the seeds were ingested.Rankins, D.

It is Alejandro Jodorowsky's first film in 23 years. The film screened at Directors' Fortnight during the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The film is based on an earlier work by Jodorowsky first published in Spanish under the title La danza de la realidad: Psicomagia y psicochamanismo (2001). Plot Young Alejandro (Jeremías Herskovits) lives with his Jewish-Ukrainian parents Jaime (Brontis Jodorowsky) and Sara (Pamela Flores) in Tocopilla, Chile. Jaime is a communist who worships Stalin and raises his son with great severity. Sara sings rather than talks throughout the film, and believes Alejandro to be the reincarnation of her father because of his long blonde hair. Irritated by his wife's delusional views of their son and angered by Alejandro's behavior, which he views as cowardly and effeminate, Jaime cuts off Alejandro's hair (which is depicted as wig in what appears to be magic realism), demands he repudiate the existence of God, and puts him through tests of self-control and bravery which include withstanding being tickled, slapped, and finally undergoing a dental operation without anesthetic. Satisfied with his son's bravery, Jaime acknowledges that he respects Alejandro and arranges for him to be made the mascot of the Tocopilla fire brigade. Alejandro accompanies the fire brigade to the scene of a fire where one of the firemen becomes trapped in the house and burns to death. During the subsequent funeral procession, Alejandro imagines himself lying in the casket with the firemen's corpse, and collapses from fright. Jaime takes him home, but burns the mascot's uniform in front of Alejandro when he wakes up, again calling his son a coward and claiming he is ashamed of him. In an attempt to prove his own bravery to the other firefighters, who he fears look down on him because of his son's cowardice and his Jewish heritage, Jaime attempts to distribute water to plague victims quarantined outside the town, but they kill and eat his donkeys and he himself is infected. He walks back to his shop, visibly infected, and a stand-off with the army ensues. As Jaime goes into convulsions and the army threaten to burn the shop to contain the infection, Sara prays for Jaime's recovery and urinates on him, curing him. Energized by his miraculous recovery, Jaime plans to assassinate the right-wing president Carlos Ibáñez del Campo (Bastian Bodenhofer). He agrees to work with another communist to assassinate Ibáñez at a dog show, but the gun fails and Jaime passes himself off as a hero when he jumps between Ibáñez and the gunman. To get close to Ibáñez, Jaime asks for a job as groom to the president's beloved horse Bucephalus as payment for his heroism. Jaime then poisons Bucephalus as part of his plot to kill Ibáñez, but when Jaime has Ibáñez at gunpoint, his hands become paralysed. The story returns to Alejandro and Sara, and Sara begins teaching Alejandro how not to be afraid of darkness and how to make sure people don't notice him. She tells him that she knows in her heart that Jaime is alive and loves both of them. They tie a stone to a balloon and release it in the belief it will find its way to him. The rock is then shown falling on the roof of a shack which Jaime is living in. Jaime awakes to discover that he has lost his memory, that he is living with a diminutive peasant woman, and that his arms have been painted the colors of the Chilean flag. Jaime begins a long journey home, but is captured by Nazis and tortured. Rebels free Jaime and return him to his family in Tocopilla. Jaime's hands are healed when Sara tells him \\"You found in Ibáñez all you admired in Stalin. You are the same as they are! You have lived in the guise of a tyrant.\\" Alejandro, Jaime, and Sara board a ship and leave Tocopilla. Cast Production After scouting for locations in Chile at his childhood village in early 2011, Alejandro Jodorowsky received permission from the local Chilean government to shoot in the coming spring. On August 22, 2011, he held a forum with the locals to discuss his vision with the film. Filming Shooting began in June 2012 and concluded the following August. Most of the film was shot in Tocopilla. Jodorowsky's wife, Pascale Montandon, was the costume designer for the film, and his three sons appeared in the film. Post-production In January 2013, Jodorowsky's son Brontis, a co- star of the film, stated that the film was in post-production and would be finished by March, saying the film is \\"very different from the other films that he made\\". The film blends Jodorowsky's personal history with metaphor, mythology and poetry, reflecting the director's view that reality is not objective but rather a \\"dance\\" created by our imaginations: \\"The story of my life is a constant effort to expand the imagination and its limitations, to capture its therapeutic and transformative potential...

Hamilton volunteered to join the Texas Brigade (also known as Hood's Brigade) Company M - First Texas Volunteer Infantry at the age of 17. After his surrender at the Appomattox Court House during the American Civil War he returned home to Sumpter, Texas May 25, 1865 without serious injury, and lived in Centralia, Groveton in Trinity County, Texas and in Haskell, Texas.  Biography  David's father, John Hamilton, moved from Oxford, Mississippi, to Rusk County, Texas in 1846. In 1852 he moved to Trinity County and located at a spring near the center of Nogalus Prairie. He sold this place to Byrd Kerr and settled two and a half miles north of there on a small prairie which went by the family name. In 1854 John Hamilton was elected County Surveyor and moved near Sumpter, opening a farm one and a half miles east of town on Homer or Clark's Ferry road. A large hewn log school house was erected in Sumpter, one block west and two blocks south of the plaza. David attended this school for a short time. John was accidentally injured on the job and his frequent absence to attend to official business required David assist his father in the survey work. After the Civil War, David Hamilton served as the Trinity County Sheriff from 1865 to 1867. He married Mary Isabell Gaston on November 8th, 1867. David and his family moved to Centralia, Texas when the county seat was moved from Sumpter to Centralia - where he operated a gristmill, sawmill, and farm. He was in the mercantile business for over 10 years. He also served in the Texas House of Representatives in the Twenty-third Texas LegislatureLegislative Reference Library of Texas from Jan 10, 1893 - Jan 8, 1895 . He was a member of the Democratic Party. His district covered the counties of Montgomery, Trinity, and Walker. In 1895, they sold their possessions and moved to Haskell County where he tried farming, and then was elected as County Judge. Then they moved to the city of Haskell, Texas. His wife Mary broke her hip and they decided to move back to Trinity County, where children John Gibson, Mary Annice and Octavia (Eddie) were living. While living in Groveton, Texas, David wrote a memoir of his Civil War experiences as a volunteer in Hood's Texas Brigade. They had eight children: John Gibson Hamilton, Mary Annice Hamilton, Maranda Alzera Hamilton, Vera Alice Hamilton, Alzara Gertrude Hamilton, Dudley Warner Hamilton, Octavia Edmonia (Eddie) Hamilton, Allene Hamilton.

A druid was a member of the high-ranking class in ancient Celtic cultures. Perhaps best remembered as religious leaders, they were also legal authorities, adjudicators, lorekeepers, medical professionals and political advisors. While the druids are reported to have been literate, they are believed to have been prevented by doctrine from recording their knowledge in written form, thus they left no written accounts of themselves. They are however attested in some detail by their contemporaries from other cultures, such as the Romans and the Greeks. The earliest known references to the druids date to the fourth century BCE and the oldest detailed description comes from Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico (50s BCE). They were described by other Roman writers such as Cicero,Cicero (44) I.XVI.90. Tacitus,Tacitus XIV.30. and Pliny the Elder.Pliny (c. 78) XVI.249. Following the Roman invasion of Gaul, the druid orders were suppressed by the Roman government under the 1st century CE emperors Tiberius and Claudius, and had disappeared from the written record by the 2nd century. In about 750 CE the word druid appears in a poem by Blathmac, who wrote about Jesus, saying that he was \\"better than a prophet, more knowledgeable than every druid, a king who was a bishop and a complete sage.\\" The druids appear in some of the medieval tales from Christianized Ireland like the \\"Táin Bó Cúailnge\\", where they are largely portrayed as sorcerers who opposed the coming of Christianity.Hutton (2009) pp. 32–37. In the wake of the Celtic revival during the 18th and 19th centuries, fraternal and neopagan groups were founded based on ideas about the ancient druids, a movement known as Neo-Druidism. Many popular notions about druids, based on misconceptions of 18th century scholars, have been largely superseded by more recent study.  Etymology  The modern English word druid derives from the Latin druidēs (plural), which was considered by ancient Roman writers to come from the native Celtic Gaulish word for these figures.Piggott (1968) p. 89.Caroline aan de Wiel, \\"Druids [3] the word\\", in Celtic Culture. Other Roman texts employ the form druidae, while the same term was used by Greek ethnographers as (druidēs). Although no extant Romano-Celtic inscription is known to contain the form, the word is cognate with the later insular Celtic words, Old Irish druí 'druid, sorcerer', Old Cornish druw, Middle Welsh dryw 'seer; wren'. Based on all available forms, the hypothetical proto-Celtic word may be reconstructed as *dru-wid-s (pl. *druwides) meaning \\"oak-knower\\". The two elements go back to the Proto-Indo-European roots *deru- and *weid- \\"to see\\". The sense of \\"oak-knower\\" or \\"oak-seer\\" is supported by Pliny the Elder, who in his Natural History considered the word to contain the Greek noun drýs (δρύς), \\"oak-tree\\" and the Greek suffix -idēs (-ιδης). Both Old Irish druí and Middle Welsh dryw could refer to the wren, possibly connected with an association of that bird with augury in Irish and Welsh tradition (see also Wren Day).  Practices and doctrines  Sources by ancient and medieval writers provide an idea of the religious duties and social roles involved in being a druid.  Societal role and training  Imaginative illustration of 'An Arch Druid in His Judicial Habit', from The Costume of the Original Inhabitants of the British Islands by S.R. Meyrick and C.H. Smith (1815), the gold gorget collar copying Irish Bronze Age examples. The Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree that the druids played an important part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British, and Irish societies.Caesar, Julius. De bello gallico. VI.13–18. He claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.Hutton (2007) pp. 44–45. Pomponius MelaPomponius Mela iii.2.18–19. was the first author to say that the druids' instruction was secret and took place in caves and forests. Druidic lore consisted of a large number of verses learned by heart, and Caesar remarked that it could take up to twenty years to complete the course of study. What was taught to druid novices anywhere is conjecture: of the druids' oral literature, not one certifiably ancient verse is known to have survived, even in translation. All instruction was communicated orally, but for ordinary purposes, Caesar reports,Caesar, Gallic Wars vi.14.3. the Gauls had a written language in which they used Greek characters. In this he probably draws on earlier writers; by the time of Caesar, Gaulish inscriptions had moved from the Greek script to the Latin script.  Sacrifice  An 18th century illustration of a wicker man, the form of execution that Caesar claimed the druids used for human sacrifice. From the \\"Duncan Caesar\\", Tonson, Draper, and Dodsley edition of the Commentaries of Caesar translated by William Duncan published in 1753. Greek and Roman writers frequently made reference to the druids as practitioners of human sacrifice.Reports of druids performing human sacrifice are found in the works of Lucan, Pharsalia i.450–458; Caesar, Gallic Wars vi.16, 17.3–5; Suetonius, Claudius 25; Cicero, Pro Font. 31; Cicero, De Rep. 9 (15);cited after Norman J. DeWitt, \\"The Druids and Romanization\\" Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 69 (1938:319–332) p. 321, note 4. According to Caesar, those who had been found guilty of theft or other criminal offences were considered preferable for use as sacrificial victims, but when criminals were in short supply, innocents would be acceptable. A form of sacrifice recorded by Caesar was the burning alive of victims in a large wooden effigy, now often known as a wicker man. A differing account came from the 10th-century Commenta Bernensia, which claimed that sacrifices to the deities Teutates, Esus and Taranis were by drowning, hanging and burning, respectively (see threefold death). Diodorus Siculus asserts that a sacrifice acceptable to the Celtic gods had to be attended by a druid, for they were the intermediaries between the people and the divinities. He remarked upon the importance of prophets in druidic ritual: There is archaeological evidence from western Europe that has been widely used to back up the idea that human sacrifice was performed by the Iron Age Celts. Mass graves found in a ritual context dating from this period have been unearthed in Gaul, at both Gournay- sur-Aronde and Ribemont-sur-Ancre in what was the region of the Belgae chiefdom. The excavator of these sites, Jean-Louis Brunaux, interpreted them as areas of human sacrifice in devotion to a war god, although this view was criticized by another archaeologist, Martin Brown, who believed that the corpses might be those of honoured warriors buried in the sanctuary rather than sacrifices. Some historians have questioned whether the Greco-Roman writers were accurate in their claims. J. Rives remarked that it was \\"ambiguous\\" whether the druids ever performed such sacrifices, for the Romans and Greeks were known to project what they saw as barbarian traits onto foreign peoples including not only druids but Jews and Christians as well, thereby confirming their own \\"cultural superiority\\" in their own minds. Nora Chadwick, an expert in medieval Welsh and Irish literature who believed the druids to be great philosophers, has also supported the idea that they had not been involved in human sacrifice, and that such accusations were imperialist Roman propaganda.Chadwick (1966) pp. xviii, 28, 91.  Philosophy  Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor referred to the druids as philosophers and called their doctrine of the immortality of the soul and reincarnation or metempsychosis \\"Pythagorean\\": Caesar made similar observations: Diodorus Siculus, writing in 36 BCE, described how the druids followed \\"the Pythagorean doctrine\\", that human souls \\"are immortal and after a prescribed number of years they commence a new life in a new body\\".Diodorus Siculus. Bibliotheca historicae. V.21–22. In 1928, folklorist Donald A. Mackenzie speculated that Buddhist missionaries had been sent by the Indian king Ashoka.Donald A.Mackenzie, Buddhism in pre-Christian Britain (1928:21). Others have invoked common Indo-European parallels.Isaac Bonewits, Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism, Citadel, 2006. Caesar noted the druidic doctrine of the original ancestor of the tribe, whom he referred to as Dispater, or Father Hades. Druids in mythology Druids play a prominent role in Irish folklore, generally serving lords and kings as high ranking priest-counselors with the gift of prophecy and other assorted mystical abilities – the best example of these possibly being Cathbad. The chief druid in the court of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster, Cathbad features in several tales, most of which detail his ability to foretell the future. In the tale of Deirdre of the Sorrows – the foremost tragic heroine of the Ulster Cycle – the druid prophesied before the court of Conchobar that Deirdre would grow up to be very beautiful, but that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would be shed because of her, and Ulster's three greatest warriors would be forced into exile for her sake. This prophecy, ignored by the king, came true. The greatest of these mythological druids was Amergin Glúingel,Also spelled Amairgin, Amorgen, Aimhirghin a bard and judge for the Milesians featured in the Mythological Cycle. The Milesians were seeking to overrun the Tuatha De Danann and win the land of Ireland but, as they approached, the druids of the Tuatha Dé Danann raised a magical storm to bar their ships from making landfall. Thus Amergin called upon the spirit of Ireland itself, chanting a powerful incantation that has come to be known as The Song of Amergin and, eventually (after successfully making landfall), aiding and dividing the land between his royal brothers in the conquest of Ireland,Lebor Gabála Érenn §65-95 Maighréad C.

Other such mythological druids were Tadg mac Nuadat of the Fenian Cycle, and Mug Ruith, a powerful blind druid of Munster. Female druids The Druidess, oil on canvas, by French painter Alexandre Cabanel (1823–1890) Irish mythology Irish mythology has a number of female druids as well, often sharing similar prominent cultural and religious roles with their male counterparts. The Irish have several words for female druids, such as bandruí (\\"woman-druid\\"), found in tales such as the Táin Bó Cúailnge; 1c: \\"dialt feminine declension, Auraic. 1830. bandruí druidess; female skilled in magic arts: tri ferdruid ┐ tri bandrúid, TBC 2402 = dī (leg. tri) drúid insin ┐ a teóra mná, TBC² 1767.\\" Bodhmall, featured in the Fenian Cycle, and one of Fionn mac Cumhaill's childhood caretakers;Parkes, \\"Fosterage, Kinship, & Legend\\", Cambridge University Press, Comparative Studies in Society and History (2004), 46: pp. 587–615. and Tlachtga,Jones, Mary. \\"The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn mac Cumhaill\\" .

W. Rolleston, Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911, pp. 109–112. Bé Chuille – daughter of the woodland goddess Flidais and sometimes described as a sorceress rather than a bandruí – features in a tale from the Metrical Dindshenchas where she joins three other of the Tuatha Dé to defeat the evil Greek witch Carman. Other bandrúi include Relbeo, a Nemedian druid who appears in The Book of Invasions, where she is described as the daughter of the King of Greece and mother of Fergus Lethderg and Alma One-Tooth.O'Boyle, p. 150. Dornoll was a bandrúi in Scotland, who normally trained heroes in warfare, particularly Laegaire and Conall; she was the daughter of Domnall Mildemail. The Gallizenae Location of Île de Sein in the Atlantic Ocean According to classical authors, the Gallizenae (or Gallisenae) were virgin priestesses of the Île de Sein off Pointe du Raz, Finistère, western Brittany. Their existence was first mentioned by the Greek geographer Artemidorus Ephesius and later by the Greek historian Strabo, who wrote that their island was forbidden to men, but the women came to the mainland to meet their husbands. Which deities they honored is unknown. According to Pomponius Mela, the Gallizenae acted as both councilors and practitioners of the healing arts: Gaul druidesses According to Historia Augusta, Alexander Severus received a prophecy about his death by a Gaul druidess (druiada).Historia Augusta, Vita Alex. Sev. 60.6 The work also has Aurelian questioning those druidesses about the fate of his descendants, to which they answered in favor of Claudius II.Historia Augusta, Vit. Aurel. 44,3 Flavius Vopiscus is also quoted as recalling a prophecy received by Diocletian from a Tungri druidess.Historia Augusta. Vita Car. Numer. Carin. 14  Sources on druid beliefs and practices   Greek and Roman records  Druids Inciting the Britons to oppose the landing of the Romans – from Cassell's History of England, Vol. I – anonymous author and artists The earliest surviving literary evidence of the druids emerges from the classical world of Greece and Rome. The archaeologist Stuart Piggott compared the attitude of the Classical authors towards the druids as being similar to the relationship that had existed in the 15th and 18th centuries between Europeans and the societies that they were just encountering in other parts of the world, such as the Americas and the South Sea Islands. He highlighted the attitude of \\"primitivism\\" in both Early Modern Europeans and Classical authors, owing to their perception that these newly encountered societies exhibited lesser technological development and backwardness in socio-political development.Piggott (1975) p. 91. The historian Nora Chadwick, in a categorization subsequently adopted by Piggott, divided the Classical accounts of the druids into two groups, distinguished by their approach to the subject as well as their chronological contexts. She refers to the first of these groups as the \\"Posidonian\\" tradition after one of its primary exponents, Posidonious, and notes that it takes a largely critical attitude towards the Iron Age societies of Western Europe that emphasizes their \\"barbaric\\" qualities. The second of these two groups is termed the \\"Alexandrian\\" group, being centred on the scholastic traditions of Alexandria in Egypt; she notes that it took a more sympathetic and idealized attitude towards these foreign peoples.Piggott (1975) pp. 91–92. Piggott drew parallels between this categorisation and the ideas of \\"hard primitivism\\" and \\"soft primitivism\\" identified by historians of ideas A. O. Lovejoy and Franz Boas.Piggott (1975) p. 92. One school of thought within historical scholarship has suggested that all of these accounts are inherently unreliable, and might be entirely fictional. They have suggested that the idea of the druid might have been a fiction created by Classical writers to reinforce the idea of the barbaric \\"other\\" who existed beyond the civilized Greco-Roman world, thereby legitimising the expansion of the Roman Empire into these areas.Aldhouse-Green (2010) p. xv. The earliest record of the druids comes from two Greek texts of c. 300 BCE: one, a history of philosophy written by Sotion of Alexandria, and the other a study of magic widely attributed to Aristotle. Both texts are now lost, but were quoted in the 2nd century CE work Vitae by Diogenes Laërtius.Diogenes Laërtius. Vitae. Introduction, section 1. Subsequent Greek and Roman texts from the 3rd century BCE refer to \\"barbarian philosophers\\", Twenty references are presented in tabular form. possibly in reference to the Gaulish druids. = Julius Caesar = dictator, who wrote the most important source for the Druids in Britain The earliest extant text that describes the druids in detail is Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, book VI, written in the 50s or 40s BCE. A military general who was intent on conquering Gaul and Britain, Caesar described the druids as being concerned with \\"divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, private or public, and the interpretation of ritual questions\\". He claimed that they played an important part in Gaulish society, being one of the two respected classes along with the equites (in Rome the name for members of a privileged class above the common people, but also \\"horsemen\\") and that they performed the function of judges. Caesar claimed that the druids recognized the authority of a single leader, who would rule until his death, when a successor would be chosen by vote or through conflict. He remarked that they met annually at a sacred place in the region occupied by the Carnute tribe in Gaul, while they viewed Britain as the centre of druidic study; and that they were not found amongst the German tribes to the east of the Rhine. According to Caesar, many young men were trained to be druids, during which time they had to learn all the associated lore by heart. He also claimed their main teaching was \\"the souls do not perish, but after death pass from one to another\\". They were concerned with \\"the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the world of nature, and the power and might of the immortal gods\\", indicating they were involved with not only such common aspects of religion as theology and cosmology, but also astronomy. Caesar held that they were \\"administrators\\" during rituals of human sacrifice, for which criminals were usually used, and that the method was through burning in a wicker man. Although he had first- hand experience of Gaulish people, and therefore likely with druids, Caesar's account has been widely criticized by modern historians as inaccurate. One issue raised by such historians as Fustel de Coulanges was that while Caesar described the druids as a significant power within Gaulish society, he did not mention them even once in his accounts of his Gaulish conquests. Nor did Aulus Hirtius, who continued Caesar's account of the Gallic Wars following Caesar's death. Hutton believed that Caesar had manipulated the idea of the druids so they would appear both civilized (being learned and pious) and barbaric (performing human sacrifice) to Roman readers, thereby representing both \\"a society worth including in the Roman Empire\\" and one that required civilizing with Roman rule and values, thus justifying his wars of conquest.Hutton (2009) pp. 04–05. Sean Dunham suggested that Caesar had simply taken the Roman religious functions of senators and applied them to the druids. Daphne Nash believed it \\"not unlikely\\" that he \\"greatly exaggerates\\" both the centralized system of druidic leadership and its connection to Britain. Other historians have accepted that Caesar's account might be more accurate. Norman J. DeWitt surmised that Caesar's description of the role of druids in Gaulish society may report an idealized tradition, based on the society of the 2nd century BCE, before the pan-Gallic confederation led by the Arverni was smashed in 121 BCE, followed by the invasions of Teutones and Cimbri, rather than on the demoralized and disunited Gaul of his own time.DeWitt (1938) p 324 ff. John Creighton has speculated that in Britain, the druidic social influence was already in decline by the mid-1st century BCE, in conflict with emergent new power structures embodied in paramount chieftains. Other scholars see the Roman conquest itself as the main reason for the decline of the druid orders. with full bibliography. Archaeologist Miranda Aldhouse-Green (2010) asserted that Caesar offered both \\"our richest textual source\\" regarding the druids, and \\"one of the most reliable\\". She defended the accuracy of his accounts by highlighting that while he may have embellished some of his accounts to justify Roman imperial conquest, it was \\"inherently unlikely\\" that he constructed a fictional class system for Gaul and Britain, particularly considering that he was accompanied by a number of other Roman senators who would have also been sending reports on the conquest to Rome, and who would have challenged his inclusion of serious falsifications. = Cicero, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo and Tacitus = Roman soldiers killing druids and burning their groves on Anglesey, as described by Tacitus Other classical writers also commented on the druids and their practices. Caesar's contemporary, Marcus Tullius Cicero, noted that he had met a Gallic druid, Divitiacus, who was a member of the Aedui tribe. Divitiacus supposedly knew much about the natural world and performed divination through augury. Whether Diviaticus was genuinely a druid can however be disputed, for Caesar also knew this figure, and wrote about him, calling him by the more Gaulish-sounding (and thereby presumably the more authentic) Diviciacus, but never referred to him as a druid and indeed presented him as a political and military leader.Hutton (2009) p. 5. Another classical writer to take up describing the druids not too long after was Diodorus Siculus, who published this description in his Bibliotheca historicae in 36 BCE. Alongside the druids, or as he called them, drouidas, whom he viewed as philosophers and theologians, he remarked how there were poets and singers in Celtic society whom he called bardous, or bards. Such an idea was expanded on by Strabo, writing in the 20s CE, who declared that amongst the Gauls, there were three types of honoured figures: * the poets and singers known as bardoi, * the diviners and specialists in the natural world known as o'vateis, and * those who studied \\"moral philosophy\\", the druidai. The Roman writer Tacitus, himself a senator and a historian, described how when the Roman army, led by Suetonius Paulinus, attacked the island of Mona (Anglesey, Ynys Môn in Welsh), the legionaries were awestruck on landing by the appearance of a band of druids, who, with hands uplifted to the sky, poured forth terrible imprecations on the heads of the invaders. He states that these \\"terrified our soldiers who had never seen such a thing before\\". The courage of the Romans, however, soon overcame such fears, according to the Roman historian; the Britons were put to flight, and the sacred groves of Mona were cut down.Tacitus 14.30. Tacitus is also the only primary source that gives accounts of druids in Britain, but maintains a hostile point of view, seeing them as ignorant savages.Rutherford (1978) p. 45.  Irish and Welsh records  During the Middle Ages, after Ireland and Wales were Christianized, druids appeared in a number of written sources, mainly tales and stories such as the Táin Bó Cúailnge, and in the hagiographies of various saints. These were all written by Christian monks. = Irish literature and law codes = In Irish-language literature, the druids – draoithe, plural of draoi – are sorcerers with supernatural powers, who are respected in society, particularly for their ability to perform divination. The Dictionary of the Irish Language defines druí (which has numerous variant forms, including draoi) as 'magician, wizard or diviner'. In the literature the druids cast spells and turn people into animals or stones, or curse peoples' crops to be blighted. When druids are portrayed in early Irish sagas and saints' lives set in the pre-Christian past of the island, they are usually accorded high social status. The evidence of the law-texts, which were first written down in the 7th and 8th centuries, suggests that with the coming of Christianity the role of the druid in Irish society was rapidly reduced to that of a sorcerer who could be consulted to cast spells or practise healing magic and that his standing declined accordingly.Kelly, A Guide to Early Irish Law, pp. 59–60. According to the early legal tract Bretha Crólige, the sick-maintenance due to a druid, satirist and brigand (díberg) is no more than that due to a bóaire (an ordinary freeman). Another law-text, Uraicecht Becc ('small primer'), gives the druid a place among the dóer-nemed or professional classes which depend for their status on a patron, along with wrights, blacksmiths and entertainers, as opposed to the fili, who alone enjoyed free nemed-status.Kelly, A Guide to Early Irish Law, p. 60. = Welsh literature = While druids featured prominently in many medieval Irish sources, they were far rarer in their Welsh counterparts. Unlike the Irish texts, the Welsh term commonly seen as referring to the druids, ', was used to refer purely to prophets and not to sorcerers or pagan priests. Historian Ronald Hutton noted that there were two explanations for the use of the term in Wales: the first was that it was a survival from the pre-Christian era, when dryw had been ancient priests; while the second was that the Welsh had borrowed the term from the Irish, as had the English (who used the terms dry and drycraeft to refer to magicians and magic respectively, most probably influenced by the Irish terms).Hutton (2009) p. 47. Archaeology As the historian Jane Webster stated, \\"individual druids ... are unlikely to be identified archaeologically\\".Webster (1999) p 6. A. P. Fitzpatrick, in examining what he believed to be astral symbolism on Late Iron Age swords has expressed difficulties in relating any material culture, even the Coligny calendar, with druidic culture. Nonetheless, some archaeologists have attempted to link certain discoveries with written accounts of the druids. The archaeologist Anne Ross linked what she believed to be evidence of human sacrifice in Celtic pagan society—such as the Lindow Man bog body—to the Greco-Roman accounts of human sacrifice being officiated over by the druids. Miranda Aldhouse-Green, professor of archaeology at Cardiff University, has noted that Suetonius's army would have passed very near the site whilst traveling to deal with Boudicca and postulates that the sacrifice may have been connected. A 1996 discovery of a skeleton buried with advanced medical and possibly divinatory equipment has, however, been nicknamed the \\"Druid of Colchester\\". Headdress of the \\"Deal Warrior\\", possibly worn by druids, 200–150 BCE, British Museum An excavated burial in Deal, Kent discovered the \\"Deal Warrior\\" – a man buried around 200–150 BCE with a sword and shield, and wearing an almost unique head-band, too thin to be part of a leather helmet. The crown is bronze with a broad band around the head and a thin strip crossing the top of the head. Since traces of hair were left on the metal it must have been worn without any padding beneath. The form of the headdress resembles depictions of Romano-British priests from several centuries later, leading to speculation among archaeologists that the man might have been a religious official – a druid.  History of reception   Prohibition and decline under Roman rule  During the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BCE, the Roman army, led by Julius Caesar, conquered the many tribal chiefdoms of Gaul, and annexed it as a part of the Roman Republic. According to accounts produced in the following centuries, the new rulers of Roman Gaul subsequently introduced measures to wipe out the druids from that country. According to Pliny the Elder, writing in the 70s CE, it was the emperor Tiberius (who ruled from 14–37 CE), who introduced laws banning not only druid practices, and other native soothsayers and healers, a move which Pliny applauded, believing that it would end human sacrifice in Gaul.Pliny XXX.13. A somewhat different account of Roman legal attacks on the druids was made by Suetonius, writing in the 2nd century CE, when he claimed that Rome's first emperor, Augustus (who had ruled from 27 BCE until 14 CE), had decreed that no-one could be both a druid and a Roman citizen, and that this was followed by a law passed by the later Emperor Claudius (who ruled 41–54 CE) which \\"thoroughly suppressed\\" the druids by banning their religious practices.  Possible late survival of Insular druid orders  The best evidence of a druidic tradition in the British Isles is the independent cognate of the Celtic *druwid- in Insular Celtic: The Old Irish druídecht survives in the meaning of 'magic', and the Welsh dryw in the meaning of 'seer'. While the druids as a priestly caste were extinct with the Christianization of Wales, complete by the 7th century at the latest, the offices of bard and of \\"seer\\" () persisted in medieval Wales into the 13th century. Phillip Freeman, a classics professor, discusses a later reference to 'dryades', which he translates as 'druidesses', writing that \\"The fourth century A.D. collection of imperial biographies known as the Historia Augusta contains three short passages involving Gaulish women called 'dryades' ('druidesses'). He points out that \\"In all of these, the women may not be direct heirs of the druids who were supposedly extinguished by the Romans – but in any case they do show that the druidic function of prophecy continued among the natives in Roman Gaul.\\" However, the Historia Augusta is frequently interpreted by scholars as a largely satirical work, and such details might have been introduced in a humorous fashion. Additionally, female druids are mentioned in later Irish mythology, including the legend of Fionn mac Cumhaill, who, according to the 12th century The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn, is raised by the woman druid Bodhmall and her companion, another wise-woman.  Christian historiography and hagiography  The story of Vortigern, as reported by Nennius, provides one of the very few glimpses of possible druidic survival in Britain after the Roman arrival. He wrote that after being excommunicated by Germanus, the British leader Vortigern invited twelve druids to assist him. In the lives of saints and martyrs, the druids are represented as magicians and diviners. In Adamnan's vita of Columba, two of them act as tutors to the daughters of Lóegaire mac Néill, the High King of Ireland, at the coming of Saint Patrick. They are represented as endeavouring to prevent the progress of Patrick and Saint Columba by raising clouds and mist. Before the battle of Culdremne (561 CE) a druid made an airbe drtiad (\\"fence of protection\\"?) round one of the armies, but what is precisely meant by the phrase is unclear. The Irish druids seem to have had a peculiar tonsure. The word druí is always used to render the Latin magus, and in one passage St Columba speaks of Christ as his druid. Similarly, a life of Saint Beuno states that when he died he had a vision of \\"all the saints and druids\\". Sulpicius Severus' vita of Martin of Tours relates how Martin encountered a peasant funeral, carrying the body in a winding sheet, which Martin mistook for some druidic rites of sacrifice, \\"because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through the fields the images of demons veiled with a white covering\\". So Martin halted the procession by raising his pectoral cross: \\"Upon this, the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks. Next, as they endeavoured, with every possible effort, to move forward, but were not able to take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the weight, they set down the dead body.\\" Then discovering his error, Martin raised his hand again to let them proceed: \\"Thus\\", the hagiographer points out, \\"he both compelled them to stand when he pleased, and permitted them to depart when he thought good.\\"  Romanticism and later revivals  Croome Park: Druid statue From the 18th century, England and Wales experienced a revival of interest in the druids. John Aubrey (1626–1697) had been the first modern writer to (incorrectly) connect Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments with the druids; since Aubrey's views were confined to his notebooks, the first wide audience for this idea were readers of William Stukeley (1687–1765).The modern career of this imagined connection of druids and Stonehenge was traced and dispelled in T. D. Kendrick, The Druids: A Study in Keltic Prehistory (London: Methuen) 1927. It is incorrectly believed that John Toland (1670–1722) founded the Ancient Druid Order; however, the research of historian Ronald Hutton has revealed that the ADO was founded by George Watson MacGregor Reid in 1909. The order never used (and still does not use) the title \\"Archdruid\\" for any member, but falsely credited William Blake as having been its \\"Chosen Chief\\" from 1799–1827, without corroboration in Blake's numerous writings or among modern Blake scholars. Blake's bardic mysticism derives instead from the pseudo-Ossianic epics of Macpherson; his friend Frederick Tatham's depiction of Blake's imagination, \\"clothing itself in the dark stole of moral sanctity\\"— in the precincts of Westminster Abbey— \\"it dwelt amid the druid terrors\\", is generic rather than specifically neo-druidic.Tatham is quoted by C. H. Collins Baker, \\"William Blake, Painter\\", The Huntington Library Bulletin, No. 10 (October 1936, pp 135–148) p. 139. John Toland was fascinated by Aubrey's Stonehenge theories, and wrote his own book about the monument without crediting Aubrey. The roles of bards in 10th century Wales had been established by Hywel Dda and it was during the 18th century that the idea arose that druids had been their predecessors. The 19th century idea, gained from uncritical reading of the Gallic Wars, that under cultural-military pressure from Rome the druids formed the core of 1st century BCE resistance among the Gauls, was examined and dismissed before World War II, His inspection of the seemingly contradictory literary sources reinforced the stated conclusion. though it remains current in folk history. Druids began to figure widely in popular culture with the first advent of Romanticism. Chateaubriand's novel Les Martyrs (1809) narrated the doomed love of a druid priestess and a Roman soldier; though Chateaubriand's theme was the triumph of Christianity over pagan druids, the setting was to continue to bear fruit. Opera provides a barometer of well- informed popular European culture in the early 19th century: In 1817 Giovanni Pacini brought druids to the stage in Trieste with an opera to a libretto by Felice Romani about a druid priestess, La Sacerdotessa d'Irminsul (\\"The Priestess of Irminsul\\"). The most famous druidic opera, Vincenzo Bellini's Norma was a fiasco at La Scala, when it premiered the day after Christmas, 1831; but in 1833 it was a hit in London. For its libretto, Felice Romani reused some of the pseudo-druidical background of La Sacerdotessa to provide colour to a standard theatrical conflict of love and duty. The story was similar to that of Medea, as it had recently been recast for a popular Parisian play by Alexandre Soumet: the chaste goddess (casta diva) addressed in Normas hit aria is the moon goddess, worshipped in the \\"grove of the Irmin statue\\". Edward Williams, known for his bardic name, \\"Iolo Morganwg\\" A central figure in 19th century Romanticist, Neo-druid revival, is the Welshman Edward Williams, better known as Iolo Morganwg. His writings, published posthumously as The Iolo Manuscripts (1849) and Barddas (1862), are not considered credible by contemporary scholars. Williams claimed to have collected ancient knowledge in a \\"Gorsedd of Bards of the Isles of Britain\\" he had organized. While bits and pieces of the Barddas still turn up in some \\"Neo-Druidic\\" works, the documents are not considered relevant to ancient practice by most scholars. Another Welshman, William Price (4 March 1800 – 23 January 1893), a physician known for his support of Welsh nationalism, Chartism, and his involvement with the Neo-Druidic religious movement, has been recognised as a significant figures of 19th century Wales. He was arrested for cremating his deceased son, a practice he believed to be a druid ritual, but won his case; this in turn led to the Cremation Act 1902.Powell (2005) p. 3.Hutton (2009) p. 253. In 1927 T. D. Kendrick sought to dispel the pseudo-historical aura that had accrued to druids, asserting that \\"a prodigious amount of rubbish has been written about Druidism\\";Kendrick 1927:viii. Neo-druidism has nevertheless continued to shape public perceptions of the historical druids. Some strands of contemporary Neo- Druidism are a continuation of the 18th century revival and thus are built largely around writings produced in the 18th century and after by second-hand sources and theorists. Some are monotheistic. Others, such as the largest druid group in the world, the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, draw on a wide range of sources for their teachings. Members of such Neo-Druid groups may be Neopagan, occultist, Christian or non-specifically spiritual.  Modern scholarship  In the 20th century, as new forms of textual criticism and archaeological methods were developed, allowing for greater accuracy in understanding the past, various historians and archaeologists published books on the subject of the druids and came to their own conclusions. The archaeologist Stuart Piggott, author of The Druids (1968), accepted the Greco- Roman accounts and considered the druids to be a barbaric and savage priesthood who performed human sacrifices.Piggott (1968) pp. 92–98. This view was largely supported by another archaeologist, Anne Ross, author of Pagan Celtic Britain (1967) and The Life and Death of a Druid Prince (1989), although she believed that they were essentially tribal priests, having more in common with the shamans of tribal societies than with the classical philosophers.Ross (1967) pp. 52–56. Ross' views were largely accepted by two other prominent archaeologists to write on the subject: Miranda Aldhouse- Green,Aldhouse-Green (1997) pp. 31–33. author of The Gods of the Celts (1986), Exploring the World of the Druids (1997) and Caesar's Druids: Story of an Ancient Priesthood (2010); and Barry Cunliffe, author of Iron Age Communities in Britain (1991) and The Ancient Celts (1997).Cunliffe (2005) pp. 518–520.

Because of this, only one floor of the campus was occupied, and some extra laptop computers and technological items, which had been acquired with the grant funds, had never been removed from their boxes for student use. In addition, the Texas Education Agency lowered the grant money level to $1.6 million (about $ when adjusted for inflation). Few of the 400 students who had previously attended CLC transferred to DeVry. Tracey Lewis, the principal of the DeVry school, said that the new location may have discouraged some of the earlier CLC students. Terry Grier, the HISD superintendent, agreed with Lewis's hypothesis. Carol Mims Galloway, a former HISD board member, said that the program was \\"set up for failure in the beginning.\\" The students, instead of receiving DeVry instruction at school, were bussed to a DeVry facility about west of DeVry Advantage to receive their DeVry instruction. In December 2011, the school announced that, due to the lower than expected enrollment, four of the HISD DeVry teachers would have no classes in the northern hemisphere spring of 2012. Because they were under contract, they continued to report to school and receive payment from HISD. One DeVry HISD teacher took another job. In April 2012 the school board approved the school's closure. Because HISD closed the school, it had to forfeit $529,000 (about $ when adjusted for inflation) in grant money.

History  AbleGamers was founded by Mark Barlet and Stephanie Walker in 2004 after Walker discovered that her Multiple sclerosis was stopping her being able to properly control a computer mouse to play video games. The charity works with individuals to assess their needs and challenges, determining what equipment they need to help them play video games - including both existing and new, custom-made, hardware. This includes both online consultations and visits to the charity's facilities. The charity helps up to 300 people every year through direct support, and more through online resources. While the program was initially opened for applications only at certain times of the year, it began being offered year-round from 2013. The charity has opened Accessibility Arcades in locations such as Washington, D.C.'s Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library and the University of Toronto's Semaphore Research Cluster, showcasing accessible hardware and games. In 2013 the charity topped $100,000 USD in donations. January 2016 the charity announced that it was extending its mission to include a new program entitled \\"Expansion Packs\\". Partnering with sponsors, AbleGamers is building accessible game rooms for activity centers that support people with disabilities, the first being at the Pediatric Specialty Care in Hopewell PA. In 2017 AbleGamers started the Player Panels initiative, whereby gamers with disabilities work with game developers to improve the accessibility of upcoming games, and participate in research studies. The AbleGamers Foundation worked with Evil Controllers to design accessible peripherals for disabled gamers, and in 2018 it was announced that the Xbox Adaptive Controller had been created in partnership with organisations including AbleGamers.  Center for Inclusive Play  In 2012, The AbleGamers Foundation opened \\"The AbleGamers Center on Game Accessibility and Inclusive Play\\" in Harpers Ferry, WV.

It is part of the Green Coast. Highway BR-101 passes through the district. Etymology The district was named after muriquis, a genus of spider monkeys. The name \\"muriqui\\" itself comes from a corruption of the word myraqui, of the Tupi language, with the alternates buriqui, barigui and baregui. According to Alcides Pissinatti, in \\"Management of Muriquis in Captivity\\" (2005): However, according to von Martius' glossary, the word comes from the Tupi words jemoroo (\\"to nourish\\"; muru, \\"nutrient\\") and aiké (a contraction of aikobê: \\"to have\\", \\"to exist\\"). History  Colonial era  Prior to 1567, all land that now belongs to Mangaratiba – including modern-day Muriqui – was part of the freguesia of Angra dos Reis, under the Captaincy of São Vicente. After that date, those lands became part of the (Royal) Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro. In 1568, the colonization of the region of modern-day Mangaratiba begins through the distribution of land to the Sá family. At some point before 1598 – the year came to Rio de Janeiro to take office as governor – finished building a new engenho (the fifth sugarcane mill of Rio de Janeiro). As per the recounting of Anthony Knivet: According to Vieira de Mello, this engenho was located in Itacuruçá, the district which Muriqui was part of until the middle of the 20th century, and thus became known as \\"Engenho of Itacuruçá\\" (). Additionally, Mirian Bondim claims that this engenho was located in the same place as modern-day Muriqui, and it is referred to by the Mangaratiba town hall as the first construction in Mangaratiba land. On 8 June 1652, D. Suzana Peixoto and her husband, Dom José Rendon de Quebedo, exchanged an engenho they owned in Irajá, known as \\"Engenho Fumaça\\", for the Engenho of Itacuruçá and some farms in Mangaratiba. Prior to this exchange, the governor of Rio de Janeiro Salvador Correia de Sá e Benevides (son of and grandson of ) owned the Engenho of Itacuruçá.  Late modern period  As a part of a series of expansions to the Central Railway of Brazil (), on 7 November 1914, the Muriqui train station was inaugurated. On 1 December 1949, via a legislative decree, the district of vila de Muriqui is delimited on land previously belonging to the district of Itacuruçá, and annexed to the municipality of Mangaratiba. Population Fauna and Flora Muriqui is surrounded mostly by Atlantic Forest, which heavily influences its fauna and flora.

In terms of balneability, the Muriqui beach has been mostly deemed improper for bathing, although there have been recent efforts in an attempt to clean Mangaratiba rivers and beaches.  Rivers  Muriqui is centered between two rivers, with Rio Catumbi to the east and Rio Muriqui (sometimes called Rio da Prata) to the west. To mitigate the risk of flooding, both rivers are periodically dredged.  Culture   Folklore  Muriqui has its own folklore, limited to the region, and separate from the national-level folklore. The story of the \\"Vieira Wind\\" () is part of the oral tradition of the district. The tale is usually related to the high- speed winds in the area during winter (roughly in the period from the end of August to the start of September). According to the (, shortened IAB), there are two different versions of the story. The first and more common one, which has been retold by Mangaratiba's official culture manager Fundação Mario Peixoto, was described by local newspaper Jornal Litoral in 2015 as follows: The second version, arguably more grounded in reality, although less common, is as follows:  Art  Muriqui is home to an art installation by Japanese artist Mariko Mori called Ring: One With Nature, inaugurated atop the Bride's Veil () waterfall in August 2016 to celebrate the 2016 Summer Olympics. The piece is an acrylic ring that changes in color depending on the position of the sun, and is meant as a representation of a sixth Olympic ring. It measures about in diameter and weighs around . File:Veu da noiva parte alta.jpgView of the art installation from atop the Bride's Veil waterfall. File:Veu da noiva muriqui.jpgView of the art installation from the base of the waterfall.  Cuisine  A cocada of Muriqui. Muriqui's most well known delicacy is the cocada (known as Cocada de Muriqui), deemed to be one of the famous sweets of the Mangaratiba cuisine. According to Fabrini dos Santos, a SEBRAE consultant, the cocadas are distinctive enough that they could, at some point, be granted a geographical indication. The district's cocada has existed at least since the construction of the BR-101 highway, and has been sold on its shoulders ever since. The coconut-based dessert has had such a cultural impact that, in March 2018, the \\"Cocada Party of Muriqui\\" () was added to the municipality's official event calendar, to be celebrated annually on the last weekend of the month of July.

Life A grandson of John Sammes, lord of the manor of Little Totham, Essex, and son of Thomas Sammes by his wife Mary (née Jeffrey), he was born at Kelvedon in Essex about 1636. His father's younger brother, Edward, married into the Aylett family of Rivenhall. In 1648 he entered Felsted School under John Glascock, a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, and a teacher of repute in East Anglia. On 3 July 1655 he was admitted a fellow-commoner of Christ's College; he graduated B.A. in 1657, was admitted to the Inner Temple on 28 October in the same year, and proceeded M.A., probably at Cambridge about 1659, though there appears to be no record of the fact. He was incorporated M.A. at Oxford on 10 July 1677. Sammes died before the completion of his major work, probably in 1679. Works His elaborate Britannia Antiqua Illustrata, or the Antiquities of Ancient Britain derived from the Phœnicians (London, 1676) only appeared as vol. i.. It was licensed by Roger L'Estrange in March 1675, and dedicated to Heneage Finch. The work, which extends to nearly 600 folio pages, brings down the narrative of British history to the conversion of Kent. It deals with the Roman period, but its main thesis is of the Phœnician derivation of the language. It reproduces ancient documents, such as the Laws of King Ina. The views derived from Strabo and the work of John Twyne. Sammes gave etymological reasons connecting Phoenician with Welsh, but did not accept the descent of the Cymry from Gomer.Herman L. J.

Celtic theories A druid, illustration from Britannia Antiqua Illustrata (1676). While the specific historical theories brought forward by Sammes were discounted by his contemporaries, his book was a contribution to a number of debates of the time, and its effect on iconography was major. The representations of Celtic druids had been developed from beginnings in Conrad Celtes and the Jani Anglorum (1610) of John Selden. Inigo Jones had made a druid stage design (1638) for Lodowick Carlell's The Passionate Lovers, drawing on earlier pageant representations of Ancient Britons, as a Wild Man. Further iconographic sources drawn upon were of the Green Man and hermits. As represented in Britannia Antiqua Illustrata the druid is a composite of \\"wild\\" and \\"holy\\".John T.

Hostile views William Nicolson accused the author of plagiarism from Samuel Bochart, and Anthony Wood reported a rumour that the work was really written by an uncle of Sammes.

Entrepreneurship itself in Finland is quite an old phenomenon. However, as everywhere else, the first startups appeared in the early 1990s and some faced demise with the end of dot-com bubble in early 2000. The early days Prior to 1995, one of the key influences was the Finnish demo scene which gathered together people interested in burgeoning technology. Many companies such as Hybrid Graphics and Riot-E as well as others have their roots in the demo scene. The dot-com bubble The dot-com bubble in the USA lasted between 1995-2000. The bubble has had a major impact on the Finnish start-up ecosystem. One of the most well-known dot-com companies, together with Riot-E, was Iobox. IObox Oy was a Finnish mobile and web portal operator. Formed in 1999, the dot-com company became part of Telefónica Mobile. At a sale price of $250m (€230m) in 2000, IObox was the largest venture capital exit in Finland. It was not surpassed until the sale of MySQL AB in 2008 for $1bn (€670m). MySQL was another start- up that was built in the middle of the dot-com bubble. The company was founded in 1995 and the first version of MySQL was released in 1996. Life after dot- com The period starting in 2003 and ending, roughly, around 2006 was a post- dot-com recovery time for the Finnish start-up ecosystem. One of the key players in the ecosystem at the time was Sulake, which was founded in 2001, but had its most important actions take place after registering as Sulake Corporation in 2003. Aula movement was one of the key events in 2006 gathering people from different backgrounds to talk about social software. This software community was the beginning of companies like Jaiku (later acquired by Google) and Dopplr (later acquired by Nokia). Since 2007  This period is characterized by the rise of a grassroots student movement initiated by Aaltoes, the emergence of a new wave of start-up entrepreneurs as well as creation of ArcticStartup, a local media 100% dedicated to covering the start- up scene in the Nordic and Baltic region. Aaltoes, or Aalto Entrepreneurship Society, was founded in 2009 by a disciplinary group of students from the three founding schools of Aalto University. Currently, Aaltoes remains student-run and a non-profit, while maintaining the largest startup community in Finland. As in Silicon Valley most startups in Finland are IT related. Recently, however, companies developing physical end-products has risen. Notable examples include Jalo Helsinki and Uploud Audio.

In 2006, she became a member of the B’in Music company (simplified Chinese: 相信音乐, another famous record company which was established in 2006). She released her debut album in 2007 and has since released five more albums. She is highly regarded both in Mainland and Taiwan.  Life and career  Della was born on 17 April 1982 in Zhejiang. She graduated from the fourth high school in Jiashan County in 1998. In the first year in junior high school, Della won the first prize in the singing contest, and her singing marks were always 95 every year. Della was interested in singing when she was a student and she always attended the annual New Year's Day Arts Festival. She was not only fond of pop music, but also adhered to sing pop songs. After graduating from junior high school, recommended by her first music teacher, Della joined a band established by the then County Children's Palace of Youth Song and Dance music lovers, and started performing on the stage. Della decided to leave home to pursue her music dream in 1999 on her own with only a shoulder bag. After she left home, she performed in different cabarets in Huzhou, Ningbo. Two years later, she got a job as a singer in the World Trade Center Bar in Hangzhou. In 2003, Della signed to the Rock Records. In 2006, Della became a member of the B’in Music Company after the audition within eight seconds. There are many superstars in the B’in Music Company, such as Mayday (五月天), Fish Leong (梁静茹), Victor Wong (品冠) and so on. Della also accelerated much popularity by her efforts. From 2009 until today, she had released five albums because of a tension in her voice. Regardless of dance music or love songs, she can sing very well with ease. In 2009, her famous song \\"I love him\\" became the winner in the \\"Taiwan KTV year-on-demand title\\". In 2015, Della entered The Chinese version of King of Mask Singer (蒙面歌王), using the mask of Black Swan to conceal her identity. She was crowned the Mask King of the second episode.

face, body, voice, motion (and more) and guide conversations as well as other social interactions by influencing our impressions of and responses to others. These percepts are important communicative tools as they convey important social and contextual information and therefore facilitate social understanding. A few examples of social cues include: * eye gaze *facial expression *vocal tone *body language Social cues are part of social cognition and serve several purposes in navigating the social world. Due to their social nature, humans rely heavily on the ability to understand other peoples’ mental states and make forecasts about their behaviour. Especially in the view of evolution, this ability is critical to determine potential threats or advantageous opportunities as well as to form and maintain relationships in order to fulfil safety and basic physiologic needs. These cues allow us to predict other people's meanings and intentions in order to be able to respond in an efficient and adaptive manner as well as anticipate how others might respond to one’s own choices. For instance, people are found to behave more prosocial in economic games when being watched which indicates potential reputational risk (watching eye effect). The ability to perceive social signals and integrate it into judgements about other’s intentional mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires, emotions, knowledge) is often referred to as theory of mind or mentalization and is already evident from ca. 18 months of age. Processing and decoding social cues is an important part of everyday human interaction (e.g. turn-taking in conversation) and therefore a critical skill for communication and social understanding. Taking into account other people’s internal states such as thoughts or emotions is a critical part of forming and maintaining relationships. The social monitoring system attunes individuals to external information regarding social approval and disapproval by increasing interpersonal sensitivity, the “attention to and accuracy in decoding interpersonal social cues” relevant to gaining inclusion. Being able to detect both positive and negative cues accurately allows to behave adaptively and avoid future rejection which therefore produces greater social inclusion. High need for social inclusion due to situational events (e.g. rejection) activates higher social monitoring and individuals that generally experience greater belonging needs are associated with greater interpersonal sensitivity. However, this mechanism should not to be confused with rejection sensitivity which reflects a bias that decodes ambiguous social cues as signs of rejection. Under-developed awareness of social cues can make interaction in social situations challenging. There are various mental disorders like schizophrenia that impair this ability and therefore make effective communication as well as forming relationships with others difficult for the affected person. Additionally, research shows that older adults have difficulties in extracting and decoding social cues from the environment, especially about human agency and intentionality. Children rely more on social cues than adults as they use them in order to comprehend and learn about their surroundings.  Examples of social cues   Nonverbal cues  = Facial cues = Facial expressions are signals that we make by moving our facial muscles on our face. Facial expressions generally signify an emotional state, and each emotional state and/or state of mind has a specific facial expression, many of which are universally used around the world. Without seeing someone's facial expression, one would not be able to see if the other person is crying, happy, angry, etc. Furthermore, facial expressions enable us to further comprehend what is going on during situations that are very difficult and/or confusing. Facial cues do not only refer to explicit expressions but also include facial appearance. There is a wealth of information that people gather simply from a person's face in the blink of an eye, such as gender, emotion, physical attractiveness, competence, threat level and trustworthiness. One of the most highly developed skills that humans have is facial perception. The face is one of the greatest representations of a person. A person's face allows others to gain information about that person, which is helpful when it comes to social interaction. The fusiform face area of the human brain plays a large role in face perception and recognition; however it does not provide useful information for processing emotion recognition, emotional tone, shared attention, impulsive activation of person knowledge and trait implications based on facial appearance. n The fallacy of making inferences about people’s personality traits from their facial appearance is referred to as overgeneralisation effect. For instance, baby face overgeneralisation produces the biased perception that people whose facial features resemble those of children have childlike traits (e.g. weakness, honesty, need to be protected) and an attractive face leads to judgements tied to positive personality traits like being socially competent, intelligent and healthy. Mainly facial features resembling low fitness (anomalous face overgeneralisation), age (baby face overgeneralisation), emotion (emotion face overgeneralisation) or a particular identity (familiar face overgeneralisation) affect impression formation and even a trace of these qualities can lead to such response. These effects are prevalent in spite of a general awareness that those impressions most likely do not represent a person’s true character. An important tool for communication in social interactions is the eyes. Gaze cues are the most informative social stimulus as they are able to convey basic emotions (e.g. sadness, fear) and reveal a lot about a person's social attention. Already 12-month-old infants respond to the gaze of adults which indicates that the eyes are an important way to communicate, even before spoken language is developed. Eye gaze direction conveys a person's social attention and eye contact can guide and capture attention as well as act as a signal of attraction. People must detect and orient to people's eyes in order to utilize and follow gaze cues. Real-world examples show the degree to which we seek and follow gaze cues may change contingent on how close the standard is to a real social interaction. People may use gaze following because they want to avoid social interactions. Past experiments have found that eye contact was more likely when there was a speaker's face available, for longer periods of real-world time. Individuals use gaze following and seeking to provide information for gaze cuing when information is not provided in a verbal manner. However, people do not seek gaze cues when they are not provided or when spoken instructions contain all of the relevant information. = Motion cues = Body language and body posture are other social cues that we use to interpret how someone else is feeling. Other than facial expressions, body language and posture are the main non-verbal social cues that we use. For instance, body language can be used to establish personal space, which is the amount of space needed for oneself in order to be comfortable. Taking a step back can therefore be a social cue indicating a violation of personal space. People pay attention to motion cues even with other visual cues (e.g. facial expression) present. Already brief displays of body motion can influence social judgements regarding inferences about a person's personality, mating behaviour as well as judgements of attractiveness. For example, a high amplitude of motion might indicate extraversion and vertical movements might form an impression of aggression. Gestures are specific motions that one makes with the hands in order to further communicate a message. Certain gestures such as pointing gestures, can help direct people's focus to what is important that is going on around them. Not only does using gestures help the speaker to better process what they are saying, but it also helps whoever is listening to that person to better comprehend what the speaker is saying.  Mechanisms Recent work done in the field studying social cues has found that perception of social cues is best defined as the combination of multiple cues and processing streams, also referred to as cue integration. Stimuli are processed through experience sharing and mentalizing and the likelihood of the other person’s internal state is inferred by the Bayesian logic. Experience sharing is a person's tendency to take on another person's facial expressions, posture and internal state and is often related to the area of empathy. A stimulus that is perceptually salient can cause a person to automatically use a bottom-up approach or cognitive top-down intentions or goals. This causes one to move in a controlled and calculated manner. A peripheral cue is used to measure spatial cuing, which does not give away information about a targets location. Naturally, only the most relevant contextual cues are processed and this occurs extremely fast (approx. 100-200 milliseconds). This type of fast, automating processing is often referred to as intuition and allows us to integrate complex multi-dimensional cues and generate suitable behaviour in real time. Cognitive learning models illustrate how people connect cues with certain outcomes or responses. Learning can strengthen associations between predictive cues and outcomes and weaken the link between nondescriptive cues and outcomes. Two aspects of the EXIT model learning phenomena have been focused on by Collins et al. The first is blocking which happens when a new cue is introduced with a cue that already has meaning. The second is highlighting which happens when an individual pays close attention to a cue that will change the meaning of a cue that they already know. When a new cue is added along with a previous one it is said that individuals only focus on the new cue to gain a better understanding as to what is going on.  Brain regions involved in processing  Benjamin Straube, Antonia Green, Andreas Jansen, Anjan Chatterjee, and Tilo Kircher found that social cues influence the neural processing of speech-gesture utterances. Past studies have focused on mentalizing as being a part of perception of social cues and it is believed that this process relies on the neural system, which consists of: * paracingulate cortex *temporal poles *superior temporal sulcus. When people focus on things in a social context, the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus areas of the brain are activated, however when people focus on a non-social context there is no activation of these areas. Straube et al. hypothesized that the areas of the brain involved in mental processes were mainly responsible for social cue processing. It is believed that when iconic gestures are involved, the left temporal and occipital regions would be activated and when emblematic gestures were involved the temporal poles would be activated. When it came to abstract speech and gestures, the left frontal gyrus would be activated according to Straube et al. After conducting an experiment on how body position, speech and gestures affected activation in different areas of the brain Straube et al. came to the following conclusions: # when a person is facing someone head on the occipital, inferior frontal, medial frontal, right anterior temporal and left hemispheric parietal cortex were activated # when participants watched an actor who was delivering a speech talking about another person an extended network of bilateral temporal and frontal regions were activated # when participants watched an actor who talked about objects and made iconic gestures the occipito-temporal and parietal brain areas were activated. The conclusion that Straube et al. reached was that speech-gesture information is effected by context-dependent social cues. The amygdala, fusiform gyrus, insula, and superior and middle temporal regions have been identified as areas in the brain that play a role in visual emotional cues. It was found that there was greater activation in the bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus and bilateral fusiform gyrus when it came to emotional stimuli. The amygdala has been connected with the automatic evaluation of threat, facial valence information, and trustworthiness of faces. When it comes to visual cues, individuals follow the gaze of others to find out what they are looking at. It has been found that this response is evolutionarily adaptive due to the fact that it can alert others to happenings in the environment. Almost 50% of the time, peripheral cues have a hard time finding the location of a target. Studies have shown that directed gaze impacts attentional orienting in a seemingly automatic manner. Part of the brain that is involved when another person averts their gaze is also a part of attentional orienting. Past researchers have found that arrow cues are linked to the fronto-parietal areas, whereas arrow and gaze cues were linked to occipito-temporal areas. Therefore, gaze cues may indeed rely on automatic processes more than arrow cues. The importance of eye gaze has increased in importance throughout the evolutionary time period. Higher level visual regions, such as the fusiform gyrus, extrastriate cortex and superior temporal sulcus (STS) are the areas of the brain that studies have found that link to perceptual processing of social/biological stimuli. Data collected from behavioral studies have found that the right hemisphere is highly connected with the processing of left visual field advantage for face and gaze stimuli. Researchers believe the right STS is also involved in using gaze to understand the intentions of others. While looking at social and nonsocial cues, it has been found that a high level of activity has been found in the bilateral extrastriate cortices in regards to gaze cues versus peripheral cues. There was a study done on two people with split-brain, in order to study each hemisphere to see what their involvement is in gaze cuing. Results suggest that gaze cues show a strong effect with the facial recognition hemisphere of the brain, compared to nonsocial cues. The results of Greene and Zaidel's study suggest that in relation to visual fields, information is processed independently and that the right hemisphere shows greater orienting. Pertaining to emotional expression the superior temporal cortex has been shown to be active during studies focusing on facial perception. However, when it comes to face identity the inferior temporal and fusiform cortex is active. During facial processing the amygdala and fusiform gyrus show a strong functional connection. Face identification can be impaired if there is damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The amygdala is active during facial expressions and it improves long-term memory for long term emotional stimuli. It has also been found that there are face response neurons in the amygdala. The connection between the amygdala, OFC, and other medial temporal lobe structures suggest that they play an important role in working memory for social cues. Systems which are critical in perceptually identifying and processing emotion and identity need to cooperate in order to maintain maintenance of social cues. In order to monitor changing facial expressions of individuals, the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex may be a crucial part in guiding critical real-world social behavior in social gatherings. The hippocampus may well be a part of using social cues to understand numerous appearances of the same person over short delay periods. The orbitofrontal cortex being important in the processing of social cues leads researchers to believe that it works with the hippocampus to create, maintain, and retrieve corresponding representations of the same individual seen with multiple facial expressions in working memory. After coming across the same person multiple times with different social cues, the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus are more strongly employed and display a stronger functional connection when disambiguating each encounter with that individual. During an fMRI scan the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus bilaterally showed activation after meeting the same person again and having previously seen two different social cues. This would suggest that both of these brain areas help retrieve correct information about a person's last encounter with the person. The ability to separate the different encounters with different people seen with different social cues leads researchers to believe that it permits for suitable social interactions. Ross, LoPresti and Schon offer that the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus are a part of both working memory and long-term memory, which permits flexibility in encoding separate representations of an individual in the varying social contexts in which we encounter them. Oxytocin has been named \\"the social hormone\\". Research done on rats provide strong evidence that social contact enhances oxytocin levels in the brain which then sets the stage for social bonds. In recent years it has been found that inhaling oxytocin through the nasal passage increases trust toward strangers and increases a person's ability to perceive social cues. Activation of face-induced amygdala was found to be increased by oxytocin in women. There have been findings that oxytocin increases occurrence of attention shifts to the eye region of a face which suggests that it alters the readiness of the brain to socially meaningful stimuli. Dopamine neuron from the ventral tegmental area codes the salience of social as well as nonsocial stimuli. Bartz and his colleagues found that the effects of oxytocin is person-dependent, meaning that every individual will be affected differently, especially those who have trouble in social situations. Research done by Groppe and colleagues supports that motivational salience of social cues is enhanced by oxytocin. Oxytocin has been found to increase cues that are socially relevant. Use of social cues during early childhood From a young age people are taught to use social cues of others to gain insight on about the world around them. There is also evidence that reliance on social cues is a naturally occurring tendency. Research has found that from birth, babies prefer infant directed speech over adult directed speech. As young as 6 months old, babies prefer someone that has previously talked to them and who speaks their native language, over someone who speaks a foreign language. According to Guellai and Steri, at 9-weeks-old, babies fixate more on an adult's eye region when they are talking to them, than when they are silent and looking at them. Guellai and Steri concluded that at birth, babies are able to read two forms of social cues which are eye gaze and voice. Children use social cues such as eye gaze and/or engaging facial expressions to understand adults' intentions while using different signs and symbols. Leekam, Soloman and Teoh hypothesized that children would pay more attention to a task if the adult had an engaging facial expression. They tested their hypothesis on 2 and 3 year olds using three signs: a pointer finger, a replica and an arrow. After their first experiment their hypothesis was supported. They found that young children understood the reasons behind the symbol or sign with the presence of an engaging face. However, when no face was visible performance significantly declined. Leekam, Soloman, and Teoh state that it is understandable that children understood the significance of the pointing sign due to their familiarity with it; children can comprehend the reference of pointing as early as 12 months. The researchers came to the conclusion that it is easier for children to identify an action carried out by a bare hand, as early as 7 months, as opposed to understanding the intent behind an action of a gloved hand. An important social cue that helps children when it comes to the function of a sign or symbol is that of an engaging face. During the difficult and unfamiliar tasks of the study, children looked for social cues more. According to studies on social referencing, infants use the emotional cues of others to guide their behavior. Vocal cues are seen as more effective because infants are used to vocal-only cues from their parents. This was shown in a visual cliff study conducted by Vaish and Striano where infants were left on the shallow end of a plexy glass cliff and mothers were on the other end. The mothers either used facial and vocal cues, facial cues only or vocal cues only to beckon their child forward. The study showed that infants crossed over faster in response to vocal-only cues than facial-only cues. It is believed that the reason infants do this is that they are accustomed to vocal-only cues from their parents. In past studies, it has been found that infants use social cues to help them learn new words especially when there are multiple objects present. Most studies have used two or more objects are used simultaneously to see if infants could learn if they are paying attention to cues presented. At 14 months old infants followed an adult's gaze to an object indicating that they believe that the eyes are important for looking. Head turning and gaze are other gazes that infants view as referential cues. Around 18 months social cues become beneficial to infants, though they are not always useful. Young infants rely on attentional cues while older infants rely more on social cues to help them learn things. However, it was found that 12 month old infants could not use cues such as, eye gaze, touching, and handling, to learn labels. Research shows that 15-month-old infants are sensitive to gaze direction directed by adults and are able to correctly use these cues to help with referent novel words. Even as toddlers, we gain social cues from others and determine how we should behave based upon these cues we receive from adults. Smith and LaFreniere mention RAI (recursive awareness of intentionality), which is the understanding of how the cues one provides will influence the beliefs and actions of those receiving them. RAI is absent in children under the age of 5, but develops during middle childhood. They tested to see if children ages 4, 6, and 8 were able to read the intentions of their partner in a game through both nonverbal hints and facial expressions. They found that 8-year-olds were better able to read their partner's cues and based their decisions off those cues. In school In the classroom there is a development of cues between the teacher and student. It seems that classrooms develop their own way of talking and communicating information. Once a set of verbal and nonverbal behaviors takes place in a classroom on a consistent basis, it becomes a norm/set of rules within the classroom. The following cues are nonverbal indications that give way to certain norms in the classroom: * pitch * stress * inflection Teachers and students develop a way of understanding the way each other thinks, believes, acts and perceives things. A teacher can use the gaze of their eyes and the position of their body to indicate where the student's attention should be held. Sometimes if students are stuck in a previous discussion or cannot determine an appropriate response to the current topic, it could mean that they did not perceive the cues that the teacher was displaying correctly. Both students and teachers must read the cues to gather what is currently going on, how they are supposed to be doing something and the reason behind what they were doing. Impairments in psychological disorders Accurately interpreting social cues is a vital part of normal social function. However, individuals with certain psychological disorders, including schizophrenia social anxiety disorder, and ADHD, tend to suffer from difficulties in interpreting and using these cues. Schizophrenia According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), schizophrenia is a psychological disorder, which has to include two out of the five symptoms listed below: # delusions # hallucinations # disorganized speech # grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior # negative symptoms: affective flattening, alogia, or avolition Schizophrenic people find it hard to pick up on social cues. More specifically, people with schizophrenia are found to have deficits in emotional facial recognition, social knowledge, empathy, and non verbal cues, and emotional processing. Most of these aspects are part of a category called social cognition. However, most tasks that are related to social cognition involve emotional processing, empathy, and social norms knowledge. When dealing with facial expression recognition, recent research has found that people with this disorder are unable to recognize facial expressions that exhibit negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. As a result, Schizophrenic people have trouble comprehending situations that involve different types of empathy, especially situations that require empathy for pain. In addition, research has found that those with schizophrenia are more likely to make additional false positives when aspects of the task are more abstract. A false positive is when a participant mistakenly believes that they observed a specific social cue in the vignette shown to them. Therefore, the social cue that they believe they saw happening in the video was nonexistent. In order to see whether someone is able to correctly identify both types of cues, researchers use the Social Cue Recognition Test, also known as SCRT. When the task is defined as being too abstract, this means that it contains abstract cues, which are cues that can be inferred from a social setting. This would consist of actions and situations that contain; affect, goals, and rules. Thus, people with Schizophrenia have trouble making inferences about social situations and settings that deal with abstract aspects. On the other hand, schizophrenic people are better at identifying features that use concrete cues, which are cues that can be observed directly. The reason for this is because concrete clues are more apparent while abstract cues are more ambiguous. Autism Individuals with autism have trouble reading social cues correctly. Misreading social cues can lead to a person acting out, which can then result in negative interactions and social disapproval. Therefore, social cues are believed to be an important aspect of inclusion and comfort in personal, interpersonal and social environments. The DSM states that Autism is a psychological disorder that has multiple symptoms that fall within three separate symptomatic categories. # Impairment in social interactions such as: #* impairment in nonverbal behaviors that are used in normal social interactions: eye to eye gaze, facial expressions, posture, and gestures #* failure to make appropriate peer relationships #* lack of sharing interest, enjoyment, and or achievements with others. #* lack of emotional and social reciprocity # Impairments in communication in one of the following: #* a delay in or lack of the development of spoken language #* impairment in ability to start and keep a conversation (only pertains to those who are sufficient in speech) #* language that is stereotyped and repetitive #* lack of diverse and spontaneous make-believe play (pretend), or imitative play that is appropriate for their age and developmental level # Restricted repetitive and stereotyped models of behavior, interests, and activities in at least one of the following: #* fixation with one or more stereotyped and restricted models of interest that is atypical in either focus or intensity #* evidently inflexible devotion to particular, nonfunctional routines or rituals #* stereotyped and continuous motor mannerisms (ex. hand or finger twisting, or whole body movements) #* constant fixation with parts of objects The main social cue impairments of those on the Autistic Spectrum include; interpreting facial expressions, understanding body language, and being able to decipher gaze direction. All three of these cues are classified under the nonverbal communication category. However, prior research has found that Autistic children and Autistic adults have no difficulty in identifying human bodily movements and or body language that is used in everyday and/or normal activities. The aspect that Autistic people have trouble with is more so the ability that is needed to verbally describe the emotions that are connected with these types of bodily movements. Children who are not Autistic learn to relate the body movements that they see with the emotions and mental states of others when they have face to face interactions with other children. Having face to face interactions with other people, helps children increase their knowledge of what these body movements represent. After seeing these representations being used multiple times, children are then able to make inferences about the representations and the people making them. This means that the children will be able to make an assumption about a person that they interact with in the future since they already understand what the body movements and or body language represents. Social anxiety Social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, is a disorder that the DSM identifies as someone who experiences some of the following: * persistent fear of one or more social or performance related situations in which the person with the fear is exposed to people that are unfamiliar * constantly fears that he or she will be humiliated, embarrassed, and or criticized by those unfamiliar people * when exposed to the feared situation, the person exhibits anxiety that may take the form of a panic attack, in children this could be crying out or a tantrum * avoids the feared situation at all costs * the avoidance of the feared situation causes one to be in distress which causes a significant interference with the persons' normal routine, relationships, and functioning in either school or work People with Social Anxiety Disorder are found to be overly concerned with the disapproval and approval of others around them. Due to this obsession with what others think of them, people with this disorder tend to interact with either a few or no people at all. As a result, they do not get an appropriate amount of social interaction, which contributes to their deficit in interpreting emotions and facial expressions. More specifically, people with Social Anxiety disorder tend to have a negative bias towards both facial expressions and emotions, which leads them to interpret such cues that are normal and or happy as being negative. Previous research has found that because people with this disorder tend to have a negative bias towards social cues, they take longer to process and comprehend social cues that represent happiness. ADHD ADHD stands for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which is a psychological disorder that most commonly exists in children and adults that also have learning disabilities. In the DSM, ADHD is classified under two symptom categories, Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity. Under the Inattention grouping, the child must exhibit six or more of the following symptoms for at least six months: * regularly fails to pay close attention to details and or makes careless mistakes in school, work, or other activities * often has trouble sustaining attention in most activities including play activities * frequently does not seem to listen when he or she is spoken to directly * repeatedly does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or tasks at work * frequently has trouble organizing activities and other tasks * regularly avoids, dislikes, and or is unwilling to participate in tasks that require a sustained amount of mental effort such as homework * repeatedly loses things that are necessary for activities such as homework, pencils, and books * is often distracted easily by stimuli Under the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity category, the child must once again exhibit six or more of the following symptoms for at least six months: * repeatedly fidgets with hands or feet or cannot stay still in his or her seat * often leaves the classroom or other activities in which he or she is supposed to remain seated * frequently runs or climbs in inappropriate situations * often talks excessively * repeatedly blurts out answers before the question or instructions are given * has trouble waiting his or her turn, very impatient * repeatedly interrupts or intrudes on others' conversations or activities The DSM also states that these symptoms must interfere or cause impairment in the patient's school, home, or work setting. It has been found that children who have both ADHD and a learning disability also have trouble comprehending social cues, have poor social skills, have difficulty creating and/or maintaining friendships, and have trouble reacting to other people's thoughts and feelings. However, part of the reason that children with ADHD have deficits in the social realm is their lack of focus and self control, which obstructs their ability to properly interpret social cues. More specifically, people with ADHD tend to focus on too many cues, which disables them from interpreting which cues are more important. Because of this, certain social situations are especially hard for people with ADHD to interpret. One situation that would meet this criteria would be when someone is being deceptive towards them. The reason a deceptive situation would be harder for some with this disorder is because the social cues one gives off when being deceptive are very subtle. Therefore, since people with ADHD already have trouble interpreting social cues, subtle social cues would be even more difficult for someone with this disorder to comprehend and or interpret. However, many studies have found that people with ADHD that take stimulants and/or prescribed medication for ADHD, are better able to interpret which social cues are of the most importance. As a result, they are better at interacting and communicating with others, which then enables them to make and maintain better friendships or relationships. In Internet communication Communication on the Internet is very different from communication with others face to face. McKenna and Bargh identified four main differences between face to face communication and communication that takes place on the internet. These four differences include: # anonymity # physical distance # physical appearance # time Anonymity is a major feature that internet communication can provide. Not only are you not able to see the person's face that you are emailing and or communicating with, but they are also not able to see your face. This can be a very positive feature for those that are socially anxious and or have a social anxiety disorder because it eliminates the idea of being publicly humiliated and or embarrassed, which is something that most people who are socially anxious are very worried about. As a result, people with social anxiety are more inclined to open up, which allows them to get closer and form more relationships with others. On the other hand, being anonymous can cause deindividuation, which is when one is no longer an individual, but rather just seen as being part of a group. In other words, one can feel like they are just one person among a thousand others and because of this, they are not as noticeable. This has found to cause some people to behave more impulsively and have less self monitoring. This type of behavior and thinking can cause one to be more blunt and aggressive towards the people that they are communicating with. However, the blunt and aggressive responses can also be due to the fact that the person is not communicating with the other person face to face. However, others have suggested that whether or not the reduced availability of social cues results in negative behavior may depend upon the situation and the individuals goals. Unlike with face-to-face communication, physical distance and/or proximity are not barriers to communicating on the Internet. The Internet allows people from all over the world to come together and interact with each other. No matter what city or country one lives in, they are able to communicate and or interact with anyone around the world who is on the Internet. As a result, people are able to make friends and communicate with others that they normally would not have been able to interact with due to physical distance. Furthermore, people are able to communicate and stay in contact with their family and friends that may live to far away to visit on a regular basis. Similar to Physical distance, time is a feature that does not matter when one is communicating on the internet. For instance, people are able to communicate with others if the person they are communicating with is not online at that moment. One way to do this is through the process of email. By communicating through email, one is able to send another person a message at any time. This also allows one to think about what they would like to say and edit their response before sending it. Furthermore, when one gets the said email, they do not have to respond right away. This means that there is also no time constraint on when one must respond. Along with proximity and time, physical appearance is another factor about the internet that is of no importance. Like previously mentioned in the anonymity paragraph, people are unable to see the physical characteristics of the person or persons that they are interacting with on the internet. This allows people to talk to others that they would normally not talk to if they had actually seen the person face to face. As a result, people are able to connect on a more meaningful level and are able to create closer relationships that are not just about physical attraction. This is also considered to be a very positive aspect about the internet. A positive feature of the internet is that it has millions of different chat rooms and blogs that allow people to communicate with others who share their same interests and values. Not only does this enable people to find others who are similar to them, but it also allows people to find emotional support. However, there also a few negative consequences of the ability to connect with like-minded others online. One negative feature is that it allows people to come together and talk about subjects such as murder, and hate groups. The absence of certain social cues online can lead to more misunderstandings than if one were communicating face to face. The reason that this can happen more easily is because when reading an email, people are not able to hear the other person's voice or see the person's facial expression. Both the voice and facial expressions are very important social cues that allow others to understand how someone else is feeling and without them, one can misinterpret what someone is saying and or wrote in an email.

Torture, while widely illegal and a violation of international law, has been frequently cited as generating false or misleading information, and lacks scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The counterargument points to some specific cases where torture has elicited true information.  Historical examples   Judicial use  =17th century= One early writer on the ineffectiveness of torture was Friedrich Spee (1591-1635), a German Jesuit priest, professor, and poet who was most noted as an opponent of trials for witchcraft. He was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against torture, especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining \\"truth\\" from someone undergoing painful questioning.Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. . The translator's introduction (pp. vii–xxxvi) contains many details on Spee's life. It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.  Military use  =World War II= After the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, the Japanese military tortured a captured American P-51 fighter pilot, Marcus McDilda, to discover how many atomic bombs the Allies had and what the future targets were. McDilda, who knew nothing about the atomic bomb or the Manhattan Project, \\"confessed\\" under torture that the US had 100 atomic bombs and that Tokyo and Kyoto were the next targets. McDilda's false confession may have swayed the Japanese leaders' decision to surrender. =Korean War= Chinese interrogators tortured US Air Force prisoners of war during the Korean War with the specific goal of eliciting false confessions. After the war, the false confessions led to allegations that the airmen had been \\"brainwashed\\"and so the United States interviewed the former prisoners of war to collect information on the torture techniques and published the results in 1957. The torture techniques were incorporated into the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program to train servicemembers to resist torture. =1992 US Army Field Manual= FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation, the United States Army field manual, explains that torture \\"is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear.\\" Torture is ineffective at gathering reliable information, and it also increases the difficulty of gathering information from a source in the future. =War on Terror and 2003 invasion of Iraq= False information about a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda was extracted from Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi through torture and was cited by the George W. Bush Administration in the months preceding its 2003 invasion of Iraq. That information was frequently repeated by members of the Bush Administration, although reports from both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) strongly questioned its credibility, suggesting that al-Libi was \\"intentionally misleading\\" interrogators.Bush's War . Directed by Michael Kirk. Frontline. March 25, 2008 Since the revelations in 2004 and 2008 that the President George W. Bush administration authorized the use of torture in interrogations, and that United States personnel have used such practices in interrogations related to the 9/11 attacks and al-Qaeda, both at black sites and at Guantánamo Bay detention camp, discussions on the topic have been heated. In commenting on the use and effectiveness of various torture methods, with a focus on waterboarding, former U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, wrote in 2009 that \\"high value information came from interrogations in which these methods were used\\". However, a Senate Committee that investigated claims of useful information being extracted from suspects that underwent enhanced interrogation concluded that critical and valuable information was not obtained using these methods. The 6,700-page Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture also concluded that the CIA had repeatedly and deliberately impeded oversight and misrepresented the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique to policymakers and to the public through coordinated leaking of false information. Alex Knapp, a staff writer at Forbes, wrote the following in 2009, \\"Time and time again, people with actual experience with interrogating terror suspects and actual experience and knowledge about the effectiveness of torture techniques have come out to explain that they are ineffective and that their use threatens national security more than it helps.\\" He had written an article about an FBI interrogator who noted that its practice did not include torture. FBI agents had registered strong disapproval of the US military approach. Annette Sisco argues that \\"the [torture] techniques... are specifically designed to make captives pliable and dependent. They are designed to get prisoners to say whatever you want them to say.\\" Many torture survivors report revealing false or incomplete information since their goal was to satisfy the torturer and end the suffering, not to reveal information. The book Pediatricians at War: the Dual-Loyalties Challenge by Fritz Allhoff explains that \\"to test the effectiveness of torture researchers would have to ignore the consent of the research subjects\\".

Life and career  Herman Egon was the fourth son of Egon VIII of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg and Countess Anna Maria of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1603–1652). He studied in Cologne from 1639 to 1643, then spent two years at the University of Leuven. In 1651, he became a secret councillor at the court of Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria. In 1655, his brothers Francis Egon and William Egon, who were both bishops, left Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg to him, in exchange for monetary compensation. In 1657, he made a similar arrangement with his older brother, Ferdinand Frederick Egon. The members of the Fürstenberg family were Imperial Counts.

It was later claimed that Stabæk accepted an offer from Vålerenga for Gunnarsson on 1 million NOK, while Rosenborg offered 5 million for Gunnarsson. At the same time, Vålerenga bought an option for Stabæk's 16-year- old Herman Stengel priced at 4 million. The contracted sum of this transfer was proportional to the sum that AS Nancy would receive, as a result from the contract of the Gunnarsson transfer in 2009, when Gunnarsson transferred between football clubs AS Nancy and Vålerenga — AS Nancy was to receive 50 percent of the transfer fee next time Gunnarsson was transferred to another club. The clubs Stabæk and Vålerenga were later fined 500,000 and 350,000 Norwegian kroner respectively, by a committee (påtalenemd) of Football Association of Norway. Thereafter a police investigation started. In the following trial the involved parties were cleared of all charges, and the Norwegian state were forced to pay compensation for wrongful prosecution. Facing legal actions from the acquitted The Norwegian Football Association chose to settle out of court also paying compensations. Media reports TV 2 (Norway) revealed on 12 October 2011 that Gunnarsson was transferred to Vålerenga for 1 million NOK, while Vålerenga paid a transfer fee of 4 million NOK for the 15-year-old footballer Herman Stengel. In 2013 Finansavisen said that \\"In addition the club in Oslo would have to pay Norwegian kroner 12.5 million or 15 million for the player himself, depending on when Vålerenga fetched the 16-year old.\\" Furthermore, the newspaper quoted påtalenemden: \\"Transfers with such sums are unknown in Norway, with a possible exception for John Carew's transfer from Vålerenga to RBK. - As late as a half year before the option agreement with Vålerenga was signed, Stabæk was evaluating if they 'should use Norwegian kroner 250000 on a 15-year old with a potential for being resold [with a profit] (salgspotensial),' according to a report from the athletic committee of the team from Bærum. Thereafter Stengel is mentioned only once—that he is considering signing on to Stabæk—in the styreprotokoller (recorded notes of the board of directors) and in the referater (recorded notes of meetings) of the athletic commission, according to påtalenemda.\\" Furthermore, \\"Påtalenemnda finds this 'remarkable' since the option agreement in the short term resulted in an infusion (to the economically troubled Stabæk)—four times as much as the Gunnarson transfer, which has been recorded in the notes of the board of directors (styrets protokoll)\\" Transfer fees offered by Rosenborg TV 2 also claimed that Stabæk turned down an offer from Rosenborg on 5 million NOK for Gunnarsson. On 8 November 2011, TV 2 revealed that Rosenborg offered to pay a transfer fee of Norwegian kroner 1 million for Gunnarsson, and 4,25 million for his Swedish teammate Johan Andersson which had six months left of his contract. Settlement of AS Nancy's compensation claim  It is alleged that the football transfer was implemented by officials in Stabæk and Vålerenga in order to deprive Nancy of its share of the transfer fee. In October 2011, Nancy asked for a resolution in trying to reclaim €250,000, since Rosenborg BK had put an option for 5 million NOK (€500,000). Nancy settled their civil claim with Stabæk on 17 November 2011. Nomination of fines by Football Association of Norway A committee of Football Association of Norway(NFF) — nominated clubs Stabæk and Vålerenga to fines of Norwegian kroner 500 000 and 350 000 respectively, while Erik Loe, Inge André Olsen and Truls Haakonsen were nominated to be banned from holding positions within NFF for a period of 18 months, 18 months and 12 months respectively. Police investigation Police started an investigation against clubs Stabæk, Vålerenga and Rosenborg in November 2011, after having interviewed NFF's påtalenemnda. Olsen and Haakonsen were arrested and charged with aggravated breach of trust - grov økonomisk utroskap - on 30 November. On the same day, The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim) was securing evidences at both Vålerenga's and Stabæk's offices. On 16 December 2011, the police also charged Erik Loe, former chairman of Stabæk Fotball, and Lars Holter-Sørensen, chairman of Stabæk AS, with breach of trust. The police announced on 3 January 2012 that they had charged a fifth person, a lawyer which is a board member of Stabæk Fotball ASA. Criticism of Stabæk's ranking on the Fair Play table On 2 December 2011, NFF released the Fair Play table for the 2011 Tippeligaen with Stabæk positioned on a fourth place, behind Tromsø, Molde and Rosenborg. Since the three first teams on the Norwegian Fair Play rank already have qualified for European competition, Stabæk will receive a berth in the first qualifying round of 2012–13 UEFA Europa League if Norway are among the top three nations on UEFA Fair Play ranking which will be released in May 2012. Roald Bruun-Hansen, the managing director of Brann stated that it does not match his perception of Fair Play when a club investigated for corruption get a Fair Play-berth, and suggested that Sarpsborg 08 gets the Fair Play-berth if Stabæk are convicted. Svein Graff, \\"informasjonsjef\\" in NFF, told TV2 that NFF are open to reconsider Stabæks Fair Play-berth, and that there are examples from other European nations where clubs have been excluded from UEFA competition because they have committed administrative criminal violations. The Stabæk-player Mikkel Diskerud stated that Stabæk have become objects of bullying by NFF. Trial The trial is scheduled to start on 19 August 2013 with four defendants: Inge André Olsen, Truls Haakonsen, Lars Holter Sørensen (a former chairman of the board of Stabæk Fotball AS) and Tor Qvarfordt Aaserød (a former member of the board of directors Stabæk Fotball AS). The fines (from the police) which have not been accepted will be a part of the trial: Stabæk Fotball (Norwegian kroner 100.000) and Stabæk Fotball AS (200.000). No one was convicted in the trial.http://www.dagsavisen.no/oslo/gunnarsson-tida-i-v%C3%A5lerenga-var-et- helvete-1.683873 Reactions to the case In a 2016 Dagbladet article Håvard Melnæs, the chief editor of Josimar (a football magazine), said that when Josimar started scrutinizing the transfer case in 2015, \\"we did not know that Jim Solbakken had such a central role. Solbakken said to TV that he did not take a part in the Veigar Páll Gunnarsson transfer to Vålerenga. But the more we investigated, and the more information we got a hold of, the more often Solbakken's name popped up. And during the work with the documentary, it became more and more clear that Jim Solbakken played a central role in the transfer. He acted as agent for Veigar Pall Gunnarson's agent for a while, he was Herman Stengel's agent, he represented Vålerenga in Gunnarsson's transfer from Stabæk, he was Stabæk's agent for a possible future transfer of Stengel, he was a go-between on Stabæk's behalf when they wanted to settle with Nancy, and he represented Nancy when Stabæk wanted to settle with the French club\\".http://www.dagbladet.no/2016/02/12/sport/meninger/josimar/43131697/ Furthermore, Melnæs says that \\"In 2014 we wrote that Solbakken was on both sides of the table during several transfers, something that is a violation of the rules for agents, and documented this\\". 2016 documentary film The 2016 documentary film, Frifinnelsen, said that lawyer Erik Flågan in 2011 threatened lawyer Gunnar Martin Kjenner and sport blogger Andreas Selliaas, in connection with the transfer case; in 2016 media said that Flågan does not want to say who he was working for.http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/overgangssaken/kjenner-og-selliaas-mener- advokat-flaagan-kom-med-trusler/a/23722062/ Film On 23 June 2016, a television documentary, Frifinnelsen, was shown on TV2.

He rose to the rank of admiral and became a Privy Counselor during the period of Denmark's policy of \\"armed neutrality\\" following the Gunboat War.The Gunboat War was part of the Napoleonic Wars, which the Danes refer to as the English Wars. He was instrumental in the rebuilding of the Danish Navy after 1814. Early life Steen Andersen Bille was born on 22 August 1751 in Assens, on the Funen coast of the Little Belt, where his father Rear Admiral Daniel Ernst Bille was then stationed. Steen Andersen Bille became a cadet at the age of eleven, despite being of poor physique, having already experienced a trial voyage in the previous year. In 1765, as a cadet, Bille was in the frigate Hvide Ørns when storms and contrary winds held the ship in the Baltic for so long that it was feared the ship would founder – prayers were said in churches around the land for the ship's safety (to good effect, seemingly). As one of the most able cadets of his year, he was promoted to Junior Lieutenant on 16 March 1768, serving then, and again in 1773, in the ship-of-the-line Norske Løve under his father's command. On 22 March 1773 he was promoted to Senior Lieutenant. In 1775 he had an independent armed command in the merchant ship Mercurius preventing smuggling to enforce control measures against an outbreak of Rinderpest (Cattle Plague) in Schleswig Holstein. The Indies – West and East In 1777 he was posted to the Danish West Indies (DWI) for two years where he became close friends with the Governor General Peter Clausen and two future Governors, Ernst Walterstorff and Peter Oxholm. On his return to Denmark he became second-in-command of the frigate Bornholm, which returned almost immediately to the DWI. Sixty of the crew, including Bille, became sick and were left on St Thomas as the ship escorted a convoy to Guadeloupe. On the way the convoy encountered three British privateers (or pirates) and all the merchant vessels were lost. This upset Bille for a long time afterwards, despite his not being responsible for the loss. Bille was promoted to Commander on 18 October 1781 and he was immediately permitted to go on a trading voyage in the Danish East Indiaman Copenhagen, one of the poorest sailing ships the company owned. After a difficult voyage to Holland, Norway and the East Indies he returned successful, but had suffered many fatalities among his crew. On the outward voyage, scurvy had broken out and not one seaman was fit for duty by the time he reached Cape Town. There Bille also broke an arm, which was not set properly and which gave him problems for the rest of his life. Arriving in Bengal, he sent his second officer home in disgrace, for embezzlement! For a few years after his return, Bille was in poor health and without a command. During this time he traveled privately to Germany and Paris. Then he received a few commands and at the age of 38 he was promoted to Captain on 6 March 1789. He became flag captain to Admiral von Schindel in Den Prægtige. Later, he commanded Havfruen and other ships. As head of cadet training in the frigate Fredericksværn in 1795, he earned his students' undying loyalty by allowing them to eat all they wanted each day. In a test in 1796, racing the old Cronborg against the newly built Najaden, Bille's Cronborg was always the victor. That same year, Bille was flag captain in the squadron of Vice-Admiral F C Kaas. In The Mediterranean In the spring of 1797, whilst most of Europe was at war, neutral Denmark had expanded its trade in the Mediterranean and it was necessary for the country's interests to protect this. The Moors had until now been appeased with annual gifts of tribute, but Tripoli now declared war on Denmark, seizing a merchant ship – the Providentia from Bergen – and selling the crew into slavery. Bille was given the task of solving the situation and he set sail in Najaden, arriving on 2 May in Malta, where the brig Sarpen and a hired armed xebec were waiting. These ships proceeded to Tripoli harbour where, on 16 May 1797, they successfully fought the Bey of Tunis's ships. The ensuing peace treaty was favourable to the Danes, and Bille's squadron continued to provide naval cover for all Danish merchant ships in the Mediterranean. Bille himself was promoted on New Years Day 1798 to senior captain (Danish – KomKapt) and honoured with an appointment as Gentleman-in-waiting to the Danish Court. Diplomacy was high on his agenda (he became the ambassador to Morocco), to protect Danish convoys and to negotiate with the British naval forces and avoid conflict when these forces demanded inspection rights whilst maintaining Denmark's policy of armed neutrality. Bille was recalled from the Mediterranean early in 1801, just as war was about to break out again between Tunis and Denmark. Battles of Copenhagen  At Toldboden (The Customs House), Major General Heinrich Ernst Peymann says goodbye to Vice Admiral Steen Andersen Bille, who is heading out for an attack on the British Navy on 17 August, 1807. On return to Denmark in 1801, Bille was again in action in the Battle of Copenhagen. His position was on the left, i.e. northern, end of the line, which included the ships-of-the- line Danmark and Trekroner, the frigate Iris, brigs Sarpen and Nidelven and a large contingent of gunboats – none of which saw serious action that day. After the battle had been raging on the southern end for close on four hours, the British Rear Admiral Thomas Graves came north with his five ships-of-the- line and three of them ran aground. The British having negotiated a ceasefire after their victory over the Danes, refloated their ships and withdrew. On 28 December 1804, with further promotion to Commodore (Kommandør), Bille became deputy in the Admiralty College. He also held positions on the African Consulate Commission, the Quarantine Commission and the Naval Defence Commission. After war flared with Britain again in 1807, Bille was named as commander of Danish naval defence under the overall command of Ernst Peymann. Peymann performed poorly against the British army that had landed near Svannemølle and capitulation of Copenhagen became unavoidable. Preparations to sink or burn the Danish fleet at anchor were made, but the expected orders were never received. At the capitulation on 7 September 1807, Bille refused to append his signature and sought permission from the crown prince (later Frederick VI) to launch what would be a suicide attack with all available weapons. He is quoted (in translation) as saying \\"I foresaw that my suggestion would achieve nothing other than my own and my naval warriors honourable deaths. In the meantime we could have won enough time that the Fleet might have been destroyed at its anchorage.\\"Compare this with the actual actions of 29 August 1943 in the same harbour. See Scuttling. On 9 October 1809 Bille was promoted to rear admiral. After the Gunboat War After the British captured the entire Danish fleet, Bille was central in organising gunboat patrols to engage British naval elements in the Baltic, and corresponded with many of the naval officers involved. In 1811 he received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog for his efforts. When Denmark-Norway dissolved after the Treaty of Kiel, it was Bille who led the attempts to establish a Danish navy and with careful financial management establish a reserve fund for the naval service. In 1825 he was promoted to vice admiral, and on 1 August 1829 to full admiral. In 1831 Bille was appointed to the Danish Privy Council. Personal life Frederikke Vilhelmine Bille Steen Andersen Bille's grave at the Cemetery of Holmen He married Frederikke Vilhelmine Charlotte Bornemann on 6 December 1790. She was the youngest daughter of Vilhelm Hansen Bornemann (1731-1801) and Talche (Thalia) Storm /1738-1779). His wife bore him three four children, Thalia Amalia Bille (1792-1820), Sophie Steensdatter Bille (1794-97), Ernst Wilhelm Bille (1795-1821), and Steen Andersen Bille (1797-1883) who became a vice admiral in the Royal Danish Nacy.. “Do right, and fear nobody\\" was his life's motto. He died on 15 April 1833 and is buried in the Cemetery of Holmen, Copenhagen. Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References *T. A.

FEM and BEM mesh refinement In recent decades the finite element and boundary element methods (FEM and BEM) have become a mainstay for industrial engineering design and analysis. Increasingly larger and more complex designs are being simulated using the FEM or BEM. However, some problems of FEM and BEM engineering analysis are still on the cutting edge. The first problem is a reliability of engineering analysis that strongly depends upon the quality of initial data generated at the pre-processing stage. It is known that automatic element mesh generation techniques at this stage have become commonly used tools for the analysis of complex real-world models.Zienkiewicz O. C., Kelly D.W., Bettes P. The coupling of the finite element method and boundary solution procedure. // International journal of Numerical Methods in Engineering, vol. 11, N 12, 1977. pp. 355–375. With FEM and BEM increasing in popularity comes the incentive to improve automatic meshing algorithms. However, all of these algorithms can create distorted and even unusable grid elements. Several techniques exist which can take an existing mesh and improve its quality. For instance smoothing (also referred to as mesh refinement) is one such method, which repositions nodal locations, so as to minimize element distortion. The Stretched Grid Method (SGM) allows the obtaining of pseudo-regular meshes very easily and quickly in a one-step solution(see Popov E.V.,On Some Variational Formulations for Minimum Surface. Transactions of Canadian Society of Mechanics for Engineering, Univ. of Alberta, vol.20, N 4, 1997, pp. 391–400.). Let one assume that there is an arbitrary triangle grid embedded into plane polygonal single-coherent contour and produced by an automeshing procedure (see fig. 1) It may be assumed further that the grid considered as a physical nodal system is distorted by a number of distortions. It is supposed that the total potential energy of this system is proportional to the length of some \\\\ n-dimensional vector with all network segments as its components. Fig. 1 A triangle grid bounded by plane polygonal single-coherent contour Thus, the potential energy takes the following form :\\\\Pi = D\\\\sum_{j=1}^n {R_j}^2 where *\\\\ n \\\\- total number of segments in the network, *\\\\ R_j \\\\- The length of segment number \\\\ j, *\\\\ D \\\\- an arbitrary constant. The length of segment number \\\\ j may be expressed by two nodal co-ordinates as :\\\\ R = \\\\sqrt{(X_{12} - X_{11})^2 + (X_{22} - X_{21})^2} It may also be supposed that co-ordinate vector \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X\\\\\\\\} of all nodes is associated with non-distorted network and co- ordinate vector \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X'\\\\\\\\} is associated with the distorted network. The expression for vector \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X\\\\\\\\} may be written as :\\\\\\\\{\\\\ X\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X'\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta \\\\ X\\\\\\\\} The vector \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X\\\\\\\\} determination is related to minimization of the quadratic form \\\\ \\\\Pi by incremental vector \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta\\\\ X\\\\\\\\}, i.e. : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Pi}{\\\\partial \\\\Delta X_{kl}} = 0 where *\\\\ l \\\\- is the number of interior node of the area, *\\\\ k \\\\- the number of co-ordinate After all transformations we may write the following two independent systems of linear algebraic equations :[\\\\ A] \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta X_1\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_1\\\\\\\\} :[\\\\ A] \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta X_2\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_2\\\\\\\\} where *[\\\\ A] \\\\- symmetrical matrix in the banded form similar to global stiffness matrix of FEM assemblage, *\\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta \\\\ X_1\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta \\\\ X_2\\\\\\\\}\\\\- incremental vectors of co-ordinates of all nodes at axes 1, 2, *\\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_1\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_2\\\\\\\\} \\\\- the right part vectors that are combined by co-ordinates of all nodes in axes 1, 2. Fig. 2 Left: distorted 2D grid, right: corrected grid The solution of both systems, keeping all boundary nodes conservative, obtains new interior node positions corresponding to a non- distorted mesh with pseudo-regular elements. For example, Fig. 2 presents the rectangular area covered by a triangular mesh. The initial auto mesh possesses some degenerative triangles (left mesh). The final mesh (right mesh) produced by the SGM procedure is pseudo-regular without any distorted elements. As above systems are linear, the procedure elapses very quickly to a one-step solution. Moreover, each final interior node position meets the requirement of co-ordinate arithmetic mean of nodes surrounding it and meets the Delaunay criteria too. Therefore, the SGM has all the positive values peculiar to Laplacian and other kinds of smoothing approaches but much easier and reliable because of integer-valued final matrices representation. Finally, the described above SGM is perfectly applicable not only to 2D meshes but to 3D meshes consisting of any uniform cells as well as to mixed or transient meshes. Minimum surface problem solution Mathematically the surface embedded into a non-plane closed curve is called minimum if its area is minimal amongst all the surfaces passing through this curve. The best-known minimum surface sample is a soap film bounded by wire frame. Usually to create a minimum surface, a fictitious constitutive law, which maintains a constant prestress, independent of any changes in strain, is used.Tabarrok, Y.Xiong. Some Variational Formulations for minimum surface. Acta Mechanica, vol.89/1–4, 1991, pp. 33–43. The alternative approximated approach to the minimum surface problem solution is based on SGM. This formulation allows one to minimize the surface embedded into non-plane and plane closed contours. Fig 3. Catenoidal surface The idea is to approximate a surface part embedded into 3D non-plane contour by an arbitrary triangle grid. To converge such triangle grid to grid with minimum area one should solve the same two systems described above. Increments of the third nodal co-ordinates may be determined additionally by similar system at axis 3 in the following way :[\\\\ A] \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta X_3\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_3\\\\\\\\} Solving all three systems simultaneously one can obtain a new grid that will be the approximating minimal surface embedded into non-plane closed curve because of the minimum of the function \\\\ \\\\Pi where parameter \\\\ j = 1,2,3. As an example the surface of catenoid which is calculated by the described above approach is presented in Fig 3. The radii of rings and the height of catenoid are equal to 1.0. The numerical area of catenoidal surface determined by SGM is equal to 2,9967189 (exact value is 2.992). Tensile fabric structures form finding Fig. 4 Hypar (hyperbolic paraboloid) Fig. 5 Saddle-type awning For structural analysis, the configuration of the structure is generally known à priori. This is not the case for tensile structures such as tension fabric structures. Since the membrane in a tension structure possesses no flexural stiffness, its form or configuration depends upon initial prestressing and the loads to which it is subjected. Thus, the load-bearing behaviour and the shape of the membrane cannot be separated and cannot be generally described by simple geometric models only. The membrane shape, the loads on the structure and the internal stresses interact in a non-linear manner to satisfy the equilibrium equations. Fig. 6 The dancefloor cover grid model Fig. 7 Render of the dancefloor cover Fig. 8 Real dancefloor cover The preliminary design of tension structures involves the determination of an initial configuration referred to as form finding. In addition to satisfying the equilibrium conditions, the initial configuration must accommodate both architectural (aesthetics) and structural (strength and stability) requirements. Further, the requirements of space and clearance should be met, the membrane principal stresses must be tensile to avoid wrinkling, and the radii of the double- curved surface should be small enough to resist out-of-plane loads and to insure structural stability (work B.Tabarrok, Z.Qin. Form Finding and Cutting Pattern Generation for Fabric Tension Structures, -Microcomputers in Civil Engineering J., № 8, 1993, pp. 377–384).). Several variations on form finding approaches based on FEM have been developed to assist engineers in the design of tension fabric structures. All of them are based on the same assumption as that used for analysing the behaviour of tension structures under various loads. However, as it is noted by some researchers it might sometimes be preferable to use the so-called ‘minimal surfaces’ in the design of tension structures. The physical meaning of SGM consists in convergence of the energy of an arbitrary grid structure embedded into rigid (or elastic) 3D contour to minimum that is equivalent to minimum sum distances between arbitrary pairs of grid nodes. It allows the minimum surface energy problem solution substituting for finding grid structure sum energy minimum finding that provides much more plain final algebraic equation system than the usual FEM formulation. The generalized formulation of SGM presupposes a possibility to apply a set of outer forces and rigid or elastic constrains to grid structure nodes that allows the modelling of various outer effects. We may obtain the following expression for such SGM formulation :\\\\Pi = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n D_j R_j^2 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^m C_{ik} \\\\Delta X_{ik}^2 - \\\\sum_{k=1}^m P_{ik} \\\\Delta X_{ik}\\\\right) where *\\\\ n \\\\- total number of grid segments, *\\\\ m \\\\- total number of nodes, *\\\\ R_j \\\\- length of segment number \\\\ j, *\\\\ D_j \\\\- stiffness of segment number \\\\ j, *\\\\ \\\\Delta X_{ik} \\\\- coordinate increment of node \\\\ k at axis \\\\ i, *\\\\ C _{ik} \\\\- stiffness of an elastic constrain in node \\\\ k at axis \\\\ i, *\\\\ P _{ik} \\\\- outer force in node \\\\ k at axis \\\\ i. Unfolding problem and cutting pattern generation Once a satisfactory shape has been found, a cutting pattern may be generated. Tension structures are highly varied in their size, curvature and material stiffness. Cutting pattern approximation is strongly related to each of these factors. It is essential for a cutting pattern generation method to minimize possible approximation and to produce reliable plane cloth data. The objective is to develop the shapes described by these data, as close as possible to the ideal doubly curved strips. In general, cutting pattern generation involves two steps. First, the global surface of a tension structure is divided into individual cloths. The corresponding cutting pattern at the second step can be found by simply taking each cloth strip and unfolding it on a planar area. In the case of the ideal doubly curved membrane surface the subsurface cannot be simply unfolded and they must be flattened. For example, in,Popov E.V. Geometrical Modeling of Tent Fabric Structures with the Stretched Grid Method. (written in Russian) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Computer Graphics&Vision; GRAPHICON’2001, UNN, Nizhny Novgorod, 2001. pp. 138–143.Popov, E.V. Cutting pattern generation for tent type structures represented by minimum surfaces. The Transactions of the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Alberta, vol. 22, N 4A, 1999, pp. 369–377. SGM has been used for the flattening problem solution. The cutting pattern generation problem is actually subdivided into two independent formulations. These are the generation of a distortion-free plane form unfolding each cloth strip and flattening double-curved surfaces that cannot be simply unfolded. Studying the problem carefully one can notice that from the position of differential geometry both formulations are the same. We may consider it as an isometric mapping of a surface onto the plane area that will be conformal mapping and equiareal mapping simultaneously because of invariant angles between any curves and invariance of any pieces of area. In the case of single-curved surface that can be unfolded precisely equi-areal mapping allows one to obtain a cutting pattern for fabric structure without any distortions. The second type of surfaces can be equi-areal mapped only approximately with some distortions of linear surface elements limited by the fabric properties. Let us assume that two surfaces are parameterized so that their first quadratic forms may be written as follows :I_1 = E_1(u, v) \\\\operatorname{d}u^2 + 2F_1(u, v) \\\\operatorname{d}u \\\\operatorname{d}v + G_1(u, v) \\\\operatorname{d}v^2 :I_2 = E_2(u, v) \\\\operatorname{d}u^2 + 2F_2(u, v) \\\\operatorname{d}u \\\\operatorname{d}v + G_2(u, v) \\\\operatorname{d}v^2 The condition of conformal mapping for two surfaces as is formulated in differential geometry requires that :\\\\sqrt{I_2} = \\\\lambda \\\\sqrt{I_1} where \\\\ \\\\lambda is the ratio of the surface distortion due to conformal mapping. It is known that the first quadratic form reflects the distance between two surface points \\\\ (u,v) and \\\\ (u + \\\\operatorname{d}u, v + \\\\operatorname{d}v). When \\\\ \\\\lambda-ratio is close to 1 the above eqn converges to condition of isometric mapping and to equi-areal mapping respectively because of invariant angles between any curves and invariance of any pieces of area. Remembering that the first stage of form finding is based on triangular mesh of a surface and using the method of weighted residuals for the description of isometric and equi-areal mapping of the minimum surface onto a plane area we may write the following function which is defined by the sum of integrals along segments of curved triangles :\\\\Pi = D\\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\oint_{S_j} w_j \\\\left(\\\\lambda \\\\sqrt{I_1} - \\\\sqrt{I_2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\operatorname{d}s where *\\\\ n \\\\- total number of grid cells, *\\\\ w_j \\\\- weight ratios, *\\\\ \\\\Pi \\\\- the total mapping residual, *\\\\ D \\\\- the constant that does not influence the final result and may be used as a scale ratio. Considering further weight ratios \\\\ w_j = 1 we may transform eqn. into approximate finite sum that is a combination of linear distances between nodes of the surface grid and write the basic condition of equi-areal surface mapping as a minimum of following non-linear function :\\\\Pi = D\\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\oint_{S_j} w_j \\\\left(\\\\lambda R_j - L_j\\\\right)^2 \\\\operatorname{d}s where *\\\\ R_j \\\\- initial length of linear segment number \\\\ j, *\\\\ L_j \\\\- final length of segment number \\\\ j, *\\\\ \\\\lambda \\\\- distortion ratio close to 1 and may be different for each segment. The initial and final lengths of segment number \\\\ j may be expressed as usual by two nodal co-ordinates as : R = \\\\sqrt{(X_{12} - X_{11})^2 + (X_{22} - X_{21})^2 + (X_{32} - X_{31})^2} : L = \\\\sqrt{(x_{12} - x_{11})^2 + (x_{22} - x_{21})^2} where *\\\\ X_{ik} \\\\- co-ordinates of nodes of the initial segment, *\\\\ x_{ik} \\\\- co-ordinates of nodes of the final segment. According to the initial assumption we can write \\\\ x_{32} = x_{31} = 0 for the plane surface mapping. The expression for vectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\ x\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X\\\\\\\\} with co-ordinate increments term use may be written as :\\\\\\\\{\\\\ x\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ X\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta \\\\ X\\\\\\\\} Fig. 9 Cut out of the twin-peaks awning Fig. 10 Initial form of the patch Fig. 11 Plane patch pattern The vector \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta \\\\ X\\\\\\\\} definition is made as previously : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Pi}{\\\\partial \\\\Delta X_{kl}} = 0 After transformations we may write the following two independent systems of non- linear algebraic equations :[\\\\ A] \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta X_1\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_1\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta P_1\\\\\\\\} :[\\\\ A] \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta X_2\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ B_2\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta P_2\\\\\\\\} where all the parts of the system can be expressed as previously and \\\\\\\\{\\\\ \\\\Delta P_1\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\ \\\\Delta P_2\\\\\\\\} are vectors of pseudo-stresses at axes 1, 2 that has the following form :\\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta P_{lt}\\\\\\\\} = -\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\lambda \\\\frac {R_m}{L_m} (x_{lm} - x_{lt}) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where *\\\\ N \\\\- total number of nodes that surround node number \\\\ t, *\\\\ l \\\\- the number of global axes. The above approach is another form of SGM and allows the obtaining of two independent systems of non-linear algebraic equations that can be solved by any standard iteration procedure. The less Gaussian curvature of the surface is the higher the accuracy of the plane mapping is. As a rule, the plane mapping allows to obtain a pattern with linear dimensions 1–2% less than corresponding spatial lines of a final surface. That is why it is necessary to provide the appropriate margins while patterning. The typical sample of cut out — also called a cutout, a gore (segment), or a patch — is presented in Figs. 9, 10, 11.

The film stars pornographic actress Samantha Fox as a psychotic young woman, recently released from a psychiatric institution, who is driven to kill by an ancestral curse. It was the first and only foray into the horror genre for Wishman, who mainly directed and produced sexploitation films. Inspired by the success of slasher films such as Halloween (1978), Wishman signed on to direct and produce the film, derived from a screenplay by Judith J. Kushner. Principal photography took place in New York in 1979, with the bulk of filming taking place at the homes of Wishman and her friends. The film had a troubled production history: Wishman alleged that multiple reels were destroyed in the photo processing lab, resulting in her having to re-film sequences to graft onto the existing footage, as well as adding in stock material in order to make the film into a releasable final product. The film was completed in 1983 after four years of post-production, and subsequently released on VHS by MPI Media Group in 1989. In 2001, it was released on DVD by Elite Entertainment. In August 2018, a video master of the original cut of the filmpreviously thought lostwas discovered in the possession of the film's cinematographer, C. Davis Smith, and uploaded on YouTube. This cut of the film features actress Diana Cummings in the lead role, as well as an entirely different plot; Cummings had been replaced by Fox after the purported destruction of Wishman's film reels. Plot The Kent family of Woodmire Lake is thought to be subject to an ancestral curse that causes each of them to be murdered or commit familicide. Bonnie Kent is among the first, found hacked to death with an axe by her sister Susan; after committing the murder, Susan slips in the bathroom and falls on the blade, killing herself. Later, Broderick Kent's wife Lola is found murdered in her bathtub; he initially denies involvement, but soon confesses to the murder before hanging himself. Broderick's niece, Vicki Kent, had been sent to an asylum in the years prior for murdering two neighborhood boys in August 1981. Six years later, Vicki is released from the asylum, apparently cured of her homicidal tendencies. Her release is against the behest of her brother, Billy, and sister, Mary, both of whom want her recommitted. Upon returning home, Vicki's parents, Adam and Blanche, struggle to help her assimilate. Vicki attempts to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend, Frankie, and is soon plagued by hallucinations. At his home, Frankie and his new girlfriend are killed in the midst of a sexual tryst, the killer decapitating him and burning his head in the fireplace. With her home life turbulent, Vicki attempts to visit her uncle Sebastian and Aunt Ann; her great aunt Bea is also staying at the home. They turn her away, however, deeming her and her siblings all insane and unsafe to be around. The next morning, when they attempt to leave their house, Sebastian is murdered with a hatchet before Ann is run over with a car. Bea is pursued inside the house and decapitated, and the killer wraps her head in a cloth before storing it in a cupboard. Later while ruminating at the lake, Vicki is chased by a zombie-like male figure who emerges from the water, only later to find it was Billy attempting to scare her. Later, Vicki attempts to seduce Tim O'Malley, a detective investigating the murders of Sebastian, Ann, and Bea, by performing a striptease. She subsequently hallucinates a sexual encounter between the two. Billy again attempts to torment Vicki, stalking her in a Halloween mask in hopes of driving her back into madness. That night, Mary awakens from a nightmare in which her entire family takes turns stabbing her to death. While Adam and Blanche attempt to console Mary, the home's electricity suddenly shuts off. Adam goes to check the main braker, and is stabbed to death with an ice pick by an unseen assailant. Shortly after, Blanche is brutally murdered in her bed. Billy finds his parents' bodies and flees the house, only to be clobbered to death with a rock by Mary, who, convinced her family had tried to kill her, murdered him out of fear. Back in the house, she hears a voice beckoning her, and traces it to a hat box, in which she has a vision of Vicki's severed head. Realizing she is in fact responsible for the murders, Mary retreats to the basement where she continues to hear disembodied voices calling her name. She flees outside into the woods, where the voices continue to taunt her. O'Malley arrives at the house and finds the numerous bodies, along with Vicki, who appears to be in a fugue state, and holding a bloody hatchet. He chases her through the house and the two engage in a physical fight. She strikes him several times with the hatchet, but he manages to overpower her and strangle her to death. In voiceover narration, O'Malley recounts his discovery of diaries from each of the family members, which reveal that Mary committed all the murders Vicki had been accused of, including the murder of the two boys that warranted her psychiatric confinement. Meanwhile, Mary departs Woodmire Lake in a taxi, and murders the cab driver with a hatchet. Cast Production Conception The screenplay for A Night to Dismember was written by Judith J. Kushner, and the film conceived by Wishman in the wake of the success of slasher films such as Halloween. In order to secure financing, Wishman made a trailer for the film using stock footage and snippets shot specifically for advertising. A financer from Chicago agreed to fund the production based on Wishman's trailer, giving her what she described as \\"a hefty deposit to finish the film.\\" Casting and filming Filming took place in New York in 1979, with many of the locations being the private residences of Wishman and her friends and family. Portions of exterior filming (such as the forest scenes, and the sequence in which the two boys are murdered in the graveyard) in Westchester County. Additional exterior footage was shot outside Wishman's apartment in Queens along the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, while rooms in Wishman's apartment were used to film several interior scenes. The final scene in which Mary's character is picked up by a taxi was shot in a rural area on Long Island. According to Wishman, she paid the taxi driver $25 to shoot footage of the car's advertisement that read \\"Get it done! America.\\" Some of the cast members were friends or family of Wishman; Miriam Meth, who portrayed Vicki's mother, was Wishman's cousin, who later worked as a makeup artist on Days of Our Lives. Miriam's house was used as a filming location as well, with her own character's death sequence being filmed in her garage. According to Wishman, pornographic actress Samantha Fox was cast as Vicki after sending a headshot and \\"writing really nice things\\" in a letter addressed to Wishman. Louis Birdi, an editor who had worked with Wishman on previous film projects, appears as a stand-in for Billy during the sequences in which the character wears a Halloween mask. The special effects were provided by Les Lorrain, visual effects by John A. Bezich; cinematographer Smith's son, Chris, also helped contribute special effects. Post-production According to Wishman, several reels of the film were destroyed while in the possession of Movielab, a photo processing studio Wishman had hired to process the film. By some accounts, the reels were destroyed in a fire, while Wishman claimed that a \\"disgruntled employee\\" destroyed them when the company went bankrupt. Wishman estimated that the incident left her with \\"less than half-a negative\\" of film. \\"I had about sixty percent of the original film, and the rest were outtakes,\\" she recalled. \\"It was very difficult to concoct another story that made any sense.\\" As a result, Wishman was forced to piece the film together with outtakes and footage from other projects. She spent eight months entirely rewriting the screenplay, followed by four years of editing the film into a releasable final product. Wishman cut the film together herself, having recently learned the basic elements of film editing. Release Distribution The film was advertised for sale in Variety in 1983. Though some contemporary scholars have alleged the film was not released, it was given a release in the United States directly to video on June 14, 1989 by MPI Media Group. The following year, the VHS was suspended from production along with several other MPI-owned titles, such as Faces of Death, Horror Hospital, and Twitch of the Death Nerve, due to rights issues. Elite Entertainment released a special edition DVD of the film in 2001, which featured an audio commentary with Wishman and cinematographer C. Davis Smith. On December 17, 2019, Frolic Pictures released the film on DVD as a double feature with Effects (1980). On January 1, 2011, the Blue Sunshine film center in Montreal screened a digitally-restored print of the film. On June 4, 2016, the film was screened at the Film Forum in New York City as part of the \\"Genre is Woman\\" film festival, and featured an introduction by Wishman biographer Michael Bowen. Critical response Buzz McClain of AllMovie called the film \\"insultingly bad, infuriating (sic) terrible, and, worse, it's somehow managed to achieve cult status over the years.\\" Author Brian Albright noted that the film is an \\"incomprehensible, yet compelling, post-modern mish-mash of gore and nudity.\\" Michael Weldon in The Psychotronic Video Guide (1996) noted the film as \\"a disastrous meeting of Wishman and H.G. Lewis\\" accentuated by \\"gore, lots of it.\\" Paper magazine, in a 1998 review, referred to the film as \\"a baffling utterly fascinating mess.\\" In a review published by Tim Lucas of Video Watchdog, it was noted: \\"A Night to Dismember is to narrative film what falling down the stairs is to walking erect.\\" Lucas specifically lambasted the film's narrative structure, and its tendency for events to be described via audio narration rather than shown. James Craddock in the Video Sourcebook gave the film its lowest rating (a \\"bomb\\"), noting: \\"Wishman has the reputation that equals Ed Wood Jr.'s as an auteur of alternative classics. This piece of junk cements her place in the cinematic hall of shame.\\" Todd Martin from HorrorNews.net panned the film, calling it \\"pointless\\", also stating that the film \\"doesn’t have anything going for it whatsoever\\". DVD Talk awarded the film two out of five stars, writing, \\"if there is such a thing as BAD bloodletting this is certainly it.\\" Mick Martin of Video Movie Guide wrote: \\"A must for bad-movie buffs, this insanely disjointed slasher movie features almost no dialogue, actors whose clothes and hairstyles change in mid-scene, and a tacked-on narration desperately trying to make sense of it all.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club wrote of the film: \\"Between the artful nature scenes, the ugly interiors, and the kitchen-sink soundtrack, A Night To Dismember could almost be an avant-garde Guy Maddin homage to wincingly awful cinema. Instead, it's likely sheer coincidence that A Night To Dismember has become its own entity, a convoluted exercise in viewer endurance that perfectly evokes its title.\\" Discovery of lost print On August 9, 2018, Bloody Disgusting reported that the extended cut of the film, previously thought destroyed, had been posted on YouTube. The print was discovered when Ben Ruffett, the founder of the Hamilton Trash Cinema, inquired to cinematographer C. Davis Smith about acquiring a copy of the film to screen. Smith did not own the film's official VHS release, but did have a copy of the original extended cut on tape. This version features actress Diana Cummings in the lead role, and runs nine minutes longer than the previously-released version. In letter correspondence, Smith noted: Smith also divulged in the letter that he had been hired as a replacement cinematographer, and that Wishman recast Fox in the lead role as she needed revenue to \\"salvage\\" the remaining footage after the reels had purportedly been destroyed. He also alleged that Fox paid Wishman $2,000 to appear in the film.

He accepted Ramanujan National Fellowship by the Government of India at the Indian Institute of Science in 2009 and now works at the new centre initiated on Earth Science there. He is married to Prof. Kusala Rajendran, currently in the faculty at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Dr. Rajendran is one of India's foremost expert in paleoseismology. He has contributed to the development of this field for the last three decades by his research contributions in seismo-tectonics, earthquake geology, paleoseismology, and tsunami geology in India. His efforts have provided insights into the earthquake recurrence and fault zone deformation in various seismotectonic provinces of India. He initiated paleoseismological work at various parts of the country including Killari (Latur), Kerala, Rann of Kachchh, Saurashtra, Cambay, Panvel (Maharashtra), Assam, Central Himalaya and Andaman-Nicobar region. His work prior to 2001 Gujarat earthquake on the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake and the linear elevated tract of land called \\"Allahbund\\" in the low-lying Rann in the northwest India has led to basic understanding on earthquake processes in the north western part of India. His search in the epicentral area of the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake led to the identification of another event between 800 and 1,000 years B.P. Based on the relative size and frequency of 2001 and older sandblows, he interpreted that the earlier earthquake may have also originated from the same source.

He was one of the first American psychologists to connect psychology with psychic phenomena. In 1906 he helped reorganize the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) in New York City and served as the secretary-treasurer for the organization until his death. Education and academic career Hyslop was educated at Wooster College, Ohio (B.A., 1877), the University of Leipzig (1882–84), and Johns Hopkins University (Ph.D., 1877). He served as an instructor in Philosophy in Lake Forest University in Illinois during 1880–82 and 1884–85, as the head of Department of Philosophy in Smith College in Massachusetts during 1885–86, and as a faculty member in Bucknell University in Pennsylvania during 1888–89. From 1889–91 he worked as a tutor in philosophy, ethics and psychology. From 1891–95 he worked as an instructor in ethics and from 1895–1902 as the professor of logic and ethics in Columbia University. During his years at Columbia University Hyslop wrote several textbooks, including The Elements of Logic (1892), Elements of Ethics (1895), and Problems of Philosophy (1905), and also became deeply involved with psychical research. In 1902 he received an honorary degree (LL.D) from the University of Wooster. Psychical research Hyslop took interest in psychical research in the 1880s. After retiring from his teaching post due to ill health, Hyslop founded the American Institute for Scientific Research in 1904 to stir interest and raise funds for psychical research.\\"American Institute for Scientific Research\\". Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. He had initially planned one section of it to be devoted to the study of abnormal psychology and another section to psychic research, believing, as he said, that \\"at certain points the two fields tend to merge and at others they are widely separated\\". He became an active member of the Society for Psychical Research and of its American branch, working closely with the secretary of the American group, Richard Hodgson, and with William James. However, the year following Richard Hodgson's death in 1905, the American Society for Psychical Research was dissolved. Hyslop revived ASPR as a section of his institute, and it soon absorbed and replaced the institute altogether. He assumed Hodgson's role as chief investigator of Leonora Piper's mediumship. He issued the first Journal in January 1907. He recruited both Hereward Carrington and Walter Franklin Prince to assist in the work. Hyslop was the secretary-treasurer and director of the organization from 1907–1920. Hyslop's first book on psychical research, Science and a Future Life, was published in 1905, and many more followed, including Enigmas of Psychic Research (1906), Borderland of Psychical Research (1906), Psychical Research and the Resurrection (1908), Psychical Research and Survival (1913), Life After Death (1918), and Contact with the Other World (1919). He wrote for the Journal and Proceedings of the ASPR and the SPR and for such publications as Mind, The Philosophical Review, and The Nation. He became convinced in the existence of an afterlife. Mental mediumship Originally an agnostic and materialist, Hyslop's interest in psychic investigation increased after sessions with the Boston medium Leonora Piper, whom he first met as early as 1888. Hyslop's first major experimental account of personal settings he had with Mrs. Piper was published in 1901 in the English proceedings. The issue as he saw it in this report was whether spiritism or telepathy exclusively from living people was the most rational explanation for the piper phenomenon, in particular, messages allegedly received from his deceased relatives. He concluded his lengthy account by saying that these messages forced him to ”give my adhesion to the theory that there is a future life and persistence of personal identity.... [and] to tolerate the spiritistic theory as rationally possible and respectable, as against stretching telepathy and its adjuncts into infinity and omniscience.” He believed that through her he had received messages from his father, his wife, and other members of his family, about which he reported in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (London, 1901). In his book Science and a Future Life (1905), Hyslop wrote of his séance sittings with the medium Leonora Piper and suggested they could only be explained by spirits or telepathy. Hyslop favoured the spiritualist hypothesis.Henry W. Wright. (1907). Some Interpretations of the Supernatural. Le divin experience et hypothèse by Marcel Hébert; L'infinité divine depuis Philon le Juif jusqu'à Plotin by Henri Guyot; Science and a Future Life by James H. Hyslop; Borderland of Psychical Research by James H. Hyslop; The Spirit World by Joseph Hamilton. The American Journal of Theology. Vol. 11, No. 2. pp. 358-362. However, Frank Podmore wrote that Hyslop's séance sittings with Piper \\"do not obviously call for any supernormal explanation\\" and \\"I cannot point to a single instance in which a precise and unambiguous piece of information has been furnished of a kind which could not have proceeded from the medium's own mind, working upon the materials provided and the hints let drop by the sitter.\\"Frank Podmore. (1902). Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism. Volume 2. p. 345 Beginning in 1907, he worked with different mediums to investigate spirit possession and obsession. He made a deep study of multiple personalities and of obsession, and came to the conclusion that in many cases it could be attributed to spirit possession. Hyslop investigated the alleged spirit possession case of Doris Fischer. After investigation, Hyslop began to believe that the personalities of Fischer were discarnate spirits. Hyslop claimed that a spirit known as Count \\"Cagliostro\\" was the leader of the possessing spirits and performed an exorcism. Hyslop quit the case hoping Fischer had been cured, however, she died in a mental hospital years later.Rosemary Guiley. (2009). The Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology. Checkmark Books. p. 69. . In 1913, Edwin William Friend was employed by Hyslop as his assistant and with help of Theodate Pope became the editor for the Journal of American Society for Psychical Research. Friend was sent articles that were to be published in the journal but instead decided to write his own articles. In response, Hyslop repossessed the editorship of the journal and both Friend and Pope resigned from the ASPR in 1915.Arthur Berger. (1988). Lives and Letters in American Parapsychology: A Biographical History, 1850-1987. McFarland. p. 62. . The charges made against Hyslop by Pope and Friend when they resigned from the ASPR in 1915 have been reechoed recently by the historian R. Laurence Moore: Hyslop ran the ASPR \\"like a dictator\\". It was a one-man rule and Hyslop was no angel. James thought him crude. Funk told Hyslop bluntly: \\"[Y]ou antagonize.\\" Hyslop's conduct in the Palladino case seems to have been costly to the ASPR. Hyslop's writings were criticized not only for their inadequacies but for his convoluted style. James's letters in 1901 and 1902 are full of complaints about it. To Hodgson he remarked: \\"I think Hyslop's discussions and methods admirable in all but literary style,\\" and in his correspondence with Flournoy, he said: \\"[Hyslop's] report is intolerably ill written and I have not been able to read the whole of it. Sir Oliver Lodge deplored the fact that Hyslop did not have \\"the gift of expressing himself in clear and simple English. Throughout his voluminous writings the sentences are frequently involved, and sometimes so curiously constructed that it is difficult to disentangle their meaning.\\" Sir William Barrett lamented similarly: \\"Hyslop would have gained a wider and more respectful hearing had he cultivated a better and more restrained style of writing, and been less dogmatic and combative in the expression of his opinions.\\"\\"Professor Edwin William Friend\\". The Lusitania Resource. On May 1, 1915 both Friend and Pope set sail on the British passenger ship RMS Lusitania with plans of forming a new psychical organization with cooperation from the British Society for Psychical Research. On May 7, the ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat. Three days after the loss of the ship, Hyslop held séance sittings with the medium Mrs. Chenoweth in an attempt to contact Friend.Michael Goss, George Behe. (1994). Lost at Sea: Ghost Ships and Other Mysteries. Prometheus Books. pp. 268-274. .Diana Preston. (2002). Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy. Walker Publishing Company. p. 105. . In 1916, Hyslop wrote that the whole case for Pearl Curran's mediumship was based on fraud. Hyslop in the Journal for the American Society for Psychical Research claimed that Curran had known people from the Ozarks who spoke a dialect reminiscent of Patience Worth and Curran's husband had studied Chaucer and educated her on the subject.Alfred Douglas. (1982). Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research. Overlook Press. pp. 170-171. . According to Hyslop the case of Patience Worth was \\"a fraud and delusion for any person who wishes to treat it seriously.\\" Hyslop also accused Casper Yost and the publisher of his book Henry Holt of knowing about the fraud but covering it up to increase sales of the book. In the Mirror articles appeared by Emily Hutchings and Yost defending Curran against allegations of fraud. In response, Hyslop wrote a letter to the Mirror which claimed he had been told of Curran's knowledge of Chaucer by a \\"scientific man\\" who had heard it from Mr Curran himself. In 1938 the ASPR journal published an anonymous article which refuted all of Hyslop's accusations. According to the article the Ozark dialect did not resemble the language of Patience Worth and knowledge of Chaucer would not have given Curran the vocabulary to compose the Patience Worth literature. Physical mediumship Although a believer in mental mediumship, Hyslop is said to have found the physical phenomena of spiritualism \\"repulsive\\".Jenny Hazelgrove. (2000). Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars. Manchester University Press. p. 163. . In 1906, Hyslop criticized the famous experiments of Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner with the medium Henry Slade and pointed out eleven possible sources of error. Psychical researcher Hereward Carrington described Hyslop's criticisms as \\"very fine\\".Hereward Carrington. (1907). The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism. Herbert B. Turner & Co. Chapter The Slade- Zöllner Investigation. pp. 19-47 In a review for the Journal of American Society for Psychical Research in 1917, Hyslop wrote that various occurrences of levitation could have been faked by trickery. He also reviewed the psychical researcher William Jackson Crawford's experiments with the medium Kathleen Goligher and suggested that reported physical phenomena in the séance room could be unreliable.Peter Aykroyd. (2009). A History of Ghosts: The True Story of Séances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters. Rodale. p. 124. . \\"A review written by James H. Hyslop and published in a 1917 issue of the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research suggests that several occurrences of levitation at séances could, in fact, have been staged. In his review of W. J. Crawford's three titles covering his experiments with the Goligher cicle... Hyslop suggests that tampering and embellishment are all too possible in a séance situation, particularly where physical phenomena are involved.\\" Personal life and family Hyslop's twin sister, Sarah Luella, died when she was four months old. His three-year-old sister, Anna Laura; and his four-year-old brother, Charles both died of scarlet fever when Hyslop was ten. His parents were devout Presbyterians. As a youth he intended to enter the ministry as his parents expected, but while in college he went through a crisis of faith and became a materialist. In 1891 he married Mary Fry Hall (1860–1900), an American woman who he had met while in Germany. A year after her death he suffered a nervous breakdown. They had one son, George H. Hyslop, and two daughters, Beatrice Fry Hyslop and Mary Winifred Hyslop. Hyslop was a friend of psychologist William James. Hyslop died of thrombosis on June 17, 1920 at age 65, after a long illness. In 1922, William van der Weyde produced an alleged spirit photograph of Hyslop during a séance at the house of Edwin F. Bowers. The photograph impressed members of Hyslop's family.Anonymous. (1922). The House that is to be Dedicated to Ghosts. South Bend News-Times. According to Fulton Oursler the photograph was a fake. Weyde had taken a photograph of Hyslop before his death and had a plate in his possession that had never been developed.Rinn, Joseph. (1950). Sixty Years of Psychical Research: Houdini and I Among the Spiritualists. Truth Seeker Company. pp. 421-422. For some time after his death his research assistant and longtime secretary, Gertrude O. Tubby, received what she believed were communications from Hyslop through many mediums in the United States, France and Britain. \\"I find it difficult to assume that I am dead,\\" he allegedly said to Gertrude, through the medium, Mrs Chenoweth (1920). Messages such as this, frequently containing apparent cross references to one another, were published in her collection entitled James H. Hyslop - X His Book: A Cross Reference Record (1929). Reception Biographer Arthur Berger has noted that Hyslop's writings were \\"criticized not only for their inadequacies but for his convoluted style.\\" Psychical researchers such as William James, Richard Hodgson and Oliver Lodge had all complained that Hyslop could not express himself in clear and simple English and some of his psychical reports were ill written. There was also hostility towards Hyslop from other psychical researchers. Historian Robert Laurence Moore has written that \\"In large measure Hyslop had only himself to blame. He found it almost impossible to cooperate with people who could not be made to share his point of view.\\"Moore, Robert Laurence. (1977). In Search of White Crows: Spiritualism, Parapsychology, and American Culture. Oxford University Press. p. 161 Psychologist Joseph Jastrow criticized Hyslop's book Enigmas of Psychical Research as he was not \\"in any scientific sense investigating the residual phenomena of psychology\\" but searching for \\"another world\\" beyond the realm of science.Jastrow, Joseph. (1906). Enigmas of Psychical Research by James H. Hyslop. The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods. Vol. 3, No. 18. pp. 498-500. Physiologist Ivor Lloyd Tuckett criticized Hyslop's interpretation of Piper's mediumship and gave an example of a mistake her control had made which was alleged to be the spirit of Hyslop's father. The control when asked if he had remembered a \\"Samuel Cooper\\" responded that he was old friend in the West, and that they used to discuss philosophy on long walks together, but the statement was proven to be false. Tuckett came to the conclusion that Piper's controls were fictitious creations and her mediumship could best be explained without recourse to the paranormal.Tuckett, Ivor Lloyd. (1911). The Evidence for the Supernatural: A Critical Study Made with \\"Uncommon Sense\\". K. Paul, Trench, Trübner. pp. 321-395. Science writer Martin Gardner described Hyslop as \\"gullible and ignorant of magic\\". According to Gardner, Piper's trance control failed to guess correctly what Hyslop's uncle died from and took twenty séance sittings to guess his uncle's name. Gardner also wrote that \\"Hyslop had been introduced to Mrs. Piper by Hodgson, who could have provided the medium with all sorts of facts about him.\\"Gardner, Martin. (1996). The Night Is Large: Collected Essays, 1938-1995. Chapter William James and Mrs. Piper. St. Martin's Press. pp. 213-243. . Psychologist H. N. Gardiner (1920) stated, \\"Hyslop cared little about style; what he cared greatly about was thoroughness\\" and, indeed, the cases reported in his bulky reports were described down to the minutest detail so that the facts could be studied. He felt \\"that the American public did not like brevity, but wanted full measure and overflowing in the discussion of any subject\\". Philosopher Josiah Royce in a review for Hyslop's The Elements of Ethics wrote that \\"[His] conscientious and detailed analysis do honor to his fairness, and make his work an extremely thoughtful one; but in matters that concern speculative skill of a constructive type this book is often, to the present reader's mind, distinctly unsatisfactory.\\"Royce, Josiah. (1895). The Elements of Ethics. by James H. Hyslop. International Journal of Ethics. Vol. 6, No. 1. pp. 113-117. In the preface to Gertrude Ogden's book James H. Hyslop - X His Book: A Cross Reference Record, physician Weston D. Bayley wrote that \\"Professor Hyslop, had, with wonderful persistence, patience and precision, placed on record a vast amount of experimental material, fully accredited and exactly sustained in accordance with the standards of evidence. His data, together with his detailed commentaries and observations, are a matter of public record. What he thus accomplished is his greatest monument; and no marble shaft could be more imperishable.\\" Hyslop in his book Life After Death. Problems of the Future Life and Its Nature argued for survival after bodily death. A review in The Monist wrote that he seemed too readily accepting of a spirit's personal identity from the alleged spirit possession case of Doris Fischer and \\"his attitude throughout is uncompromising.\\"Anonymous. (1920). Life After Death. Problems of the Future Life and Its Nature by James H. Hyslop. The Monist. Vol. 30, No. 4. pp. 639-640.

It is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn and the archdeaconry of Blackburn. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The church has a seating capacity of 191. History The church probably dates from the 14th century, rebuilt about 1513 by the Molyneux family. Originally known as Burgh Chapel, the church was a chapel of ease to St Andrew's Church, Leyland and was used as a Roman Catholic chapel until the late 17th or early 18th century, when it was transferred to the Church of England. The church was originally built as a chapel for Euxton Hall and bears a date stone with the initials of one of the Molyneux family who were the owners of the chapel and Euxton Hall from the 14th century. Architecture Exterior There is a commonality between the appearance of Euxton Parish Church and the oldest parts of neighbouring 14th-century church in Eccleston. Having evolved from a small family chapel into a local parish church, the exterior of the church has seen several stages of modifications, the most recent being the addition of a porch, which was built at the front of the church in 1998 using a similar red sandstone taken from the barn of Eli Heaton (who had served as church verger for over 40 years). Interior Notably, in the nave there is a double piscina and sedilia which have been dated from around the first 50 years of the 14th century. External features The churchyard contains the war grave of an airman of World War II.

History  It was first known as Carissa Grace Mission School, Inc., offering a preschool course for children 3½–6 years old. Rev. David Jhung, a Korean missionary, founded the school in November 1999 as a free kindergarten. To respond to the needs of Christian families in the community, he decided to continue the program in June 2000 as formal educational institution for nursery, kindergarten, and preparatory levels registered with the Department of Trade and Industry. He aimed for a school geared to the attainment of the highest academic standards for the development of personality in a Christian environment. Due to parental demand, the school started operating grade 1 in June 2001, an additional level for 2002, and two more levels for 2003. The school registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2001. Pursuant to the provision of Act #2706, as amended, and Batas Pambansa Bilang 232 (Educational Act of 1982), DepEd granted the Government Permit to operate the complete pre-school and elementary courses (grades 1-4). In March 2003, the institution bought a plot in Bagtas and started the construction of the new school building. In March 2003, the school board amended its articles of incorporation and by-laws, changing the name from Carissa Grace Mission School, Inc., to Good Tree International School, Inc., and transferred the newly named school from Carissa to Bagtas, Tanza, Cavite. At the same time, Good Tree International School acquired another lot and started the construction of the preschool building. In 2006, the school started its high school level with recognition from the DepEd. The three-storey high school building was completed during that year.

Discovery and naming Pterofiltrus was named by Jiang Shunxing and Wang Xiaolin in 2011. The type species is Pterofiltrus qiui. The generic name is derived from Greek πτερόν, pteron, \\"wing\\", and a Mediaeval Latin filtrum, \\"felt\\" or \\"filter\\", in reference to the dentition. The specific name honours Professor Qiu Zhanxiang. The holotype of Pterofiltrus, IVPP V12339, was early 21st century discovered at Zhangjiagou in Liaoning Province in a layer of the Jianshangou Beds of the lower Yixian Formation dating from the early Aptian, about 125 million years old. It consists of a disarticulated skull compressed on a slab together with two rami of a hyoid and the first two neck vertebrae. Description The skull of Pterofiltrus is very elongated, with an estimated length of 208 millimetres. It has a smooth, slightly concave, upper profile lacking any bony crests. The lower jaws too are long, and without a keel. The describers established the presence of five diagnostic traits. The total number of teeth in the head is about 112. The teeth cover more than half of the skull length, at 55.8%. The front teeth differ in length. The symphysis of the lower jaws represent more than half of the mandibular length, at 58%. The underside of this symphysis features a trough. The last two traits are autapomorphies unique to the species. The dentition consists of very elongated pointed teeth, directed partly sideways. These on average strongly increase in length to the front meanwhile becoming more anteriorly directed. Closing the beak the teeth would have meshed together, with the front teeth sticking out beyond the upper and lower margins of the head. The teeth are evenly spaced. There are twenty-nine teeth in the upper jaw with the second and fifth tooth being the longest. The 174 millimetres long lower jaw contains about twenty-seven teeth. Phylogeny The describers assigned Pterofiltrus to the Ctenochasmatidae within the larger Archaeopterodactyloidea, using the comparative method.

He attended high school in Merano and Trento, and from 1806 studied medicine in Innsbruck. On the outbreak of war in 1809 he became a secretary to Andreas Hofer, and later continued his studies in Erlangen and Vienna. In 1812 he moved to Berlin, where he met Christian Friedrich von Petersdorff and Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. In the summer of 1812, he went to London together with several Tyroleans to appeal for support in the fight against Napoleon. From 1813 he was in the Lützow Free Corps as an active leader of a group of Tyrolean marksmen which gained fame at Lauenburg and Jülich. In September 1813 he was promoted to second lieutenant. After the First Treaty of Paris in 1814, he completed his studies in Berlin and became a supporter of Franz Anton Mesmer and his theory of animal magnetism. In 1819, he became a professor of medicine in Bonn, leaving in 1837 for Innsbruck and then, in 1841, settling in Munich, where he earned a great reputation as a \\"magnetic physician.\\" He died in Egern (now Rottach-Egern) by Lake Tegernsee in southern Germany.

Service for the Japanese version ended per customary closure protocol on March 31, 2020.  Gameplay  The game is a role-playing game in the vein of the traditional Final Fantasy installments, but with a focus on social interactions. The player will be able to play with friends through multiplayer. Jobs, airships, equipment, and summon monsters typical of the Final Fantasy series will be featured. Basic job classes are fighter, monk, thief, white mage, black mage, and red mage, which can all develop into many different types of advanced classes. Players team up each other to complete missions, obtain items, grow stronger, and defeat villains. Plot Long ago, the country was protected by two crystals. However, one was broken and scattered throughout the world following a monster invasion. The other lost its glow. Only the ancient summon beasts can return the crystals to their original shine, and it's up to the player to travel to the world below on his/her air ship and show the summons his/her power. Updates to the game in Japan lets players match custom made characters and classic heroes from Final Fantasy against villains Sin and Jecht. Various crossover characters from other Final Fantasy series games appear, including Paradox from Final Fantasy XIII-2, which takes place in a special event, and success reaps a special reward. Sephiroth was introduced in the \\"Cloudy Wolf\\" event in February 2013.  Development  The game was initially hinted when Square Enix opened a teaser site as a collaboration between mobage and Square Enix. Yoichi Wada unveiled Final Fantasy Brigade on December 2, 2011. It was Square Enixs first free to play mobile game associated with the Final Fantasy series. The game is in development by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A closed beta started in mid-December 2011, before the game's official release on January 6, 2012. A smartphone version was also announced, although it had no release date. The art style of the game is similar to the one from Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. It is being distributed through DeNA in Japan and Korea: in Korea it was localized by Daum Communications and released in August 2012. On November 30, 2012, Square Enix and DeNa announced the game would be coming to North American IOS devices.

Reception The game reached over 500,000 members thirteen days afters its release. Within one month, this figure had increased to 1 million registered members. By March 2012, the game had 2 million registered members, and that July crested over 2.5 million registered users in Japan alone. In Japan, Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade Mobicoin cards are being sold.

He had some commercial success in Quebec, Canada's predominantly francophone province. Marc Aryan visited Turkey where his parents originated from. His success was huge after his release of the oriental-themed \\"Istanbul\\", one of his best known hits that became an instant classic in Turkey. He also released a number of re- arrangements of his biggest hits in Turkish language, following the example of famous European artists who had done the same like Salvatore Adamo, Johnny Hallyday, Sacha Distel, Enrico Macias and Peppino di Capri. Turkish language versions in his album Istanbul'da include 9 songs including \\"Yalancısın\\", \\"Dünya Dönüyor\\", \\"Kalbin Yok Mu?\\" and others. The Turkish lyrics were mostly written by Fecri Ebcioğlu. In 1968, he also visited the Soviet Union where he sang for tens of thousands of fans in Moscow and other cities filling stadiums. Marc Aryan also eventually visited his homeland Armenia for very successful concert tour insisting to sing some songs in Armenian including the famous \\"Yerevan\\" dedicated to the Armenian capital. Markal Record Label Marc Aryan founded his own record label named Markal where he released many of his songs. He also founded a music publishing house. Katy Studios and production work Upon his return in 1969, he established a music studio he named Katy after his successful single \\"Katy\\". Many renowned artists recorded albums in Marc Aryan's studios including Julio Iglesias, Salvatore Adamo, Michel Fugain, Frédéric François, Will Tura, Danyel Gérard, Patrick Hernandez, Toots Thielemans. Anthony Quinn recorded his successful hit \\"I Love You\\" in Marc Aryan's studio. Marvin Gaye recorded his album Midnight Love in Katy Studios in 1981. The album went on to earn Gaye two Grammy Awards. Personal life Born in an ethnic Armenian family in 1926, he was the third of seven siblings. He had great affinity for languages, and was able to speak several language (up to 9). His love for music started very early to the detriment of school. He initially helped with his father's business in selling Middle Eastern food. He fell very ill while he was just 18, and left the father's business and later on, decided to concentrate on music, particularly finding success after moving to Belgium. Marc Aryan died in 1985 in Belgium from a cardiac arrest. He was just 59. He had written more than 200 songs. There had been a confusion whether he was born in 1935 instead, but the tombstone confirms the year of birth as 1926. His best songs were released in a double CD collection in 1974 again hitting the Top 10 of sales. In 1997, a tribute concert entitled \\"Hommage à Marc Aryan\\" was held in Schaerbeek, in which his most well-known songs were interpreted by contemporary singers including Marka, Perry Rose, Dominique A, Jean-Luc of Sttellla, Be Plouvier, Zop Hophop and actor Benoit Poelvoorde.

English botanist Edward Rudge was the first to describe this species as Styphelia amplexicaulis in 1807. It was later renamed by the prolific Scottish botanist, Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The species name is Latin for \\"stem-clasping\\" and refers to the leaves. It grows as a slender plant up to 0.9 m (3 ft) high, sometimes with a scrambling habit. The small branches have fine hairs. The leaves measure 9.5 to 34 mm in length by 4.5 to 20 mm across, and are distinctively heart-shaped and surround the stem at their base. The white flowers appear from July to November, peaking over August and September. Three to twelve small tubelike flowers arise along stalks up to 3.7 cm long. These are followed by the development of fleshy fruit known as drupes which are ripe from September to December. Leucopogon amplexicaulis ranges from the Sydney Basin south to Shoalhaven on the New South Wales South Coast. It is found on sandstone soils in sclerophyll forest, where it grows in sheltered locations on sandstone outcrops and platforms, often near natural seepage. In the Sydney region it is associated with trees such as Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) and smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata), and shrubs such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral fern (Gleichenia dicarpa) and dog rose (Bauera rubioides). Plants live between twenty and thirty years, and become more common in areas long unburnt by bushfire. Leucopogon amplexicaulis is killed by fire and regenerates by seed. The seeds are thought to possibly be dispersed by ants. Members of the genus Leucopogon are seldom cultivated, as their propagation by seed or cutting can be difficult. L. amplexicaulis requires a well-drained site with ample moisture and dappled shade in a garden situation. Reproduction Beard-heath is killed by fire and regenerates by seed. The seeds are thought to possibly be dispersed by ants. These plants, which are members of the genus Leucopogon are seldom cultivated as their propagation by seed or cutting can sometimes be difficult. They can be cultivated if grown, in humus-enriched and well-drained soil. They best grown in full sun, which keeps the growth impact, and may benefit from light trimming. If they are propagated from seed, they mostly need stratification or prolonged soaking, of from layers or half- hardened tip cuttings. For growing in gardens, they must have a well-drained site with ample moisture and dappled shade with a cool root run provided by large stones. Uses It is mainly used for ornamental purposes in home gardens and public parks. They are also displayed at botanical gardens for educational purposes. It also has decorative value and can be used to make bouquets. It has various environmental beneficial effects which are similar to other plants. Its roots bind to the soil and prevent soil erosion. The plant has chlorophyll in its leaves perform photosynthesis, which means taking in the carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen and thus fighting global warming.

The play, set in ancient kingdom of Magadha, recounts how Chandragupta Maurya, with the help of his faithful minister Chanakya, ascended the throne of Magadha by defeating and subsequently killing his half-brother Nanda. It is one of the most popular plays by Ray. The story of the play is loosely borrowed from the Puranas and the Greek history. Sources The play, as Dwijendralal Ray himself cited, was drawn from the Hindu Puranas (possibly the Vishnu Purana) and Greek history. The accounts of Chandraketu and Mura is loosely borrowed from Sanskrit play Mudrarakshasa. The love affair between Chandragupta and Chhaya as well as the sub-plot regarding the story of Antigonus is Ray’s original thoughts. Characters * Nanda – King of Magadha. * Chandragupta – Nanda's half-brother, later Emperor of India. * Bachal – Nanda's brother-in-law. * Chanakya – A Brahmin, later Prime Minister of Chandragupta. * Katyayan – Nanda's minister. * Chandraketu – King of Malaya. * Sekendar Shah – Greek Emperor. * Seleucus – Greek Commander, later Greek King. *Antigonus – a Greek Commander. * Helena – Seleucus's daughter, later Empress of India. * Chhaya – Chandraketu's sister. *Mura – Chandragupta's mother. The characters Helena and Chhaya were created by Roy. Other characters appear in historical records or earlier legends, such as Mudrarakshasa. Synopsis Chandragupta, the Prince of Magadha, after being overthrown and exiled by his half-brother Nanda, joined Sekendar Shah’s army where Seleucus taught him the art of warfare. Later, with the help of Chandraketu, the young king of Malay, Chanakya, the former Royal Priest and Katyayan, the former Prime Minister of Magadha, Chandragupta defeated and overthrown Nanda who was later put to death by Chankya. Chandraketu’s sister Chhaya fell in love with Chandragupta. After Sekandar Shah’s death, Seleucus became the emperor of Asia. He appointed Antigonus, an exiled Greek legionary, as the commander of his army. Antigonus fell in love with Seleucus’s daughter Helena, who was already in love with Chandragupta, and was refused by both her and Seleucus, mentioning Antigonus was an illegitimate child. Antigonus went back to Greece and upon questioning his mother, learnt that he was a legal son of none but Seleucus himself. Later, Seleucus attacked Magadha but was defeated. As a part of the peace treaty signed between Chanakya, new Prime Minister of Magadha and Seleucus, Chandragupta married Helena. Upon learning Chhaya also loved Chandragupta, Helena helped her to marry him, too. Antigonus comes back to India and declared that he is a legal son of Seleucus, and hence Helena’s half-brother and the Chandragupta’s brother-in-law. Songs Chandragupta has eight songs, written and composed by Dwijendralal Ray himself. These are: # \\"Tumi He Praner Bnodhu\\" (\\"তুমি হে প্রাণের বঁধু\\") (Act I, Scene iii) # \\"Aay Re Basanta, Tor Kiran-Makha Pakha Tuli\\" (\\"আয় রে বসন্ত, তোর কিরণমাখা পাখা তুলি\\") (Act I, Scene iv) # \\"Jakhan Saghano Gagano Garaje Barashe Kadka Dhara\\" (\\"যখন সঘন গগন গরজে বরষে কড়কা ধারা\\") (Act III, Scene i) # \\"Aar Keno Michhe Asha, Michhe Bhalobasa, Michhe Keno Tnar Bhabana\\" (\\"আর কেন মিছে আশা, মিছে ভালবাসা, মিছে কেন তাঁঁর ভাবনা\\") (Act III, Scene v) # \\"Ghano Tamasabrito Ambaro Dharni\\" (\\"ঘন তমসাবৃত অম্বর ধরণী\\") (Act IV, Scene i) # \\"Aji Gao Mahageet\\" (\\"আজি গাও মহাগীত\\") (Act IV, Scene vi) # \\"Oi Mahasindhur Opar Theke Ki Sangeet Bhese Ase\\" (\\"ওই মহাসিন্ধুর ওপার থেকে কি সংগীত ভেসে আসে\\") (Act V, Scene ii) # \\"Sakal Byathar Byathi Ami Hoi, Tumi Hao Sab Sukher Bhagi\\" (\\"সকল ব্যথার ব্যথী আমি হই, তুমি হও সব সুখের ভাগী\\") (Act V, Scene iii) According to Sukumar Bandyopadhyay, the songs of this play were highly successful as each of the song has some special significance regarding the story of the play. Adaptations The play was adapted into a Tamil film called Mathru Bhoomi (1939) directed by H. M.
