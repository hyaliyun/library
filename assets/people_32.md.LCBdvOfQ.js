The British Columbia government's BC Names system, a subdivision of GeoBC, defines a land district as \\"a territorial division with legally defined boundaries for administrative purposes\\" BC Names/Geo BC entry \\"New Westminster Land District\\" All land titles and surveys use the Land District system as the primary point of reference, and entries in BC Names for placenames and geographical objects are so listed. Description This land district is named for the city of New Westminster, which at the time of its creation was the capital of the Mainland Colony. Greater Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, the Sunshine Coast and the Highway 99 corridor up to and including the Resort Municipality of Whistler, are all within this land district, as well as Savary, Raza, and East and West Redonda Islands. Also included are the settlements of Skookumchuck Hot Springs (Skatin) and Port Douglas on the lower Lillooet River, Long Island, which is a large island in the middle or Harrison Lake, and the Village of Harrison Hot Springs, the western half of the District of Kent, and almost all of City of Chilliwack. To the north of the New Westminster Land District are Range 1 Coast Land District and the Lillooet Land District, to its east is the Yale Division Yale Land District and for the small portion of its boundary within the Lillooet Ranges, the Kamloops Division Yale Land District. =Boundary= The land district's southern boundary lies along part of the international boundary between BC Canada and the US state of Washington. The western end of the land district's southern boundary meets the centre of the Strait of Georgia where it turns along the midline until it diverges to follow Malaspina Strait, bypasses Texada Island which has its own separate land district, then rejoins the midline of the Strait of Georgia approximately midway between Comox and Powell River to a point south of Hernando Island, then traversing the mouth of Desolation Sound following Calm Channel between Cortes Island to the west and West Redonda and Raza Islands to Pryce Channel, then following that channel and Homfray Channel to 51 degree 14 minutes north, from whence it proceeds eastward, other than two small variances around certain land parcels in the area of Homfray Channel and the Soo River, to the summit of the Garibaldi Ranges just south of Mount Currie to a point southwest of In-SHUCK- ch Mountain (Gunsight Peak), then eastward via roughly 50 degrees 7 minutes north latitude to the divide of the Lillooet Ranges, following that for a short distance, then south via an irregular line to Harrison Lake, meeting that lake's shoreline northwest of the mouth of Big Silver Creek (aka Big Silver River) and following the lake south so as to include Long Island but exclude Echo Island. Upon reaching the foot of Harrison Lake, the boundary of the land district proceeds southward so as to include the Village of Harrison Hot Springs and to bisect the District of Kent, excluding the town of Agassiz, roughly along 121 degree 17 minutes west longitude, to a point east of Rosedale to roughly 49 degrees 11 minutes north latitude, west a short distance to 121 degrees 47 minutes 38 seconds west longitude to roughly 49 degrees 10 minutes 32 seconds north latitude, east along that line which corresponds to Nevin Road to 121 degrees 9 minutes 7 second west and following that line south to 49 degrees 9 minutes 40 seconds north latitude, where it goes a short distance west to roughly 121 degrees 47 minutes 25 seconds west longitude, then south along that line to meet the eastern end of the land district boundary that lies along part of the international boundary.British Columbia Online Cadastre To use this system to view Land District boundaries, pan or zoom to the approximate location, or use [Find Location tab] to pick a Land District by name.

The paleocave formed in the Eccles Formation dolomites (Malmani Subgroup, Chuniespoort Group carbonate-banded iron formation marine platform). Gondolin is currently the only described hominin-bearing fossil site in the Northwest Province-portion of the designated Cradle of Humankind UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cave is located on privately owned land and is not accessible to the public. As is the case with other South African Paleo-cave systems with Pliocene and/or Pleistocene fossil deposits, the system was mined for lime during the early 20th century. As a result, the system has been heavily disturbed and consists of only a small active cave, a series of in situ remnant cave deposits, and extensive dumpsites of ex situ calcified sediments produced during mining activities. Site history and excavations No records of the date of lime mining activities at Gondolin, maps or photographs of the cave prior to mining are known to exist. Long-term residents near Gondolin report that the system was mined prior to the 1950s. The cave was named after J.R.R. Tolkien's Gondolin by the early 1970s. Transvaal Museum Bulletin, Issues 10-22 (1971). Exposed fossils in the cave system were noted at least as early as the 1970s and brought to the attention of Elisabeth Vrba and David Panagos at the (then) Transvaal Museum (now the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History), who initiated excavations in early 1979. The first phase of excavation addressed the extremely fossiliferous in situ remnant deposits adhering to the northern wall of the cave system (the GD 2 deposits sensu). The three-week 1979 excavation removed approximately of calcified sediments from the northern cave wall. While two distinct sediment phases were recognized during the original excavation, later work with the fossil fauna and geology of the GD 2 deposits did not find any basis for multiple depositional phases within the sampled sequence. The removed sediment blocks were organised into 43 blocks/trays and processed using acetic acid at the Transvaal Museum. A significant gap in research at Gondolin occurred in the 1980s, during which time all of the excavated blocks were processed (but no further in situ or ex situ sampling is known to have occurred). The first description of the result fossil assemblage in 1993 only partially described 4,344 individual specimens that could be assigned to a specific taxonomic levels (out of the 90,663 total specimens recovered from acetic acid processing of the 43 trays/blocks). In 1997 a survey of the sediments at Gondolin included the first sampling of the extensive ex situ dumpsite deposits at the locality via a test trench (Trench A). Materials removed from Trench A included fossiliferous breccia blocks from most, if not all, of the stratigraphic units present at the site (as well as loose fossil specimens sifted from decalcified sediments). From this sampled material (the GD A faunal assemblage), two isolated hominin teeth (representing two different individuals) were recovered. The first, GA 1, is a worn and fractured left molar that has not been confidently attributed to either genus or species (but resembles Homo in some features. In contrast, GA 2 is a complete left m2 that has been recently analysed and attributed to Paranthropus robustus (if from a large individual). The most recent excavations at Gondolin were undertaken in 2003 and 2004 to explore the largely decalcified GD 1 deposits along the northwestern rim of the Gondolin locality. A four-week excavation season produced a sample of 4,863 fossil specimens from approximately of soil overburden and naturally decalcified sediments that were screened with 1mm mesh. Critically, integration of taphonomic and geologic data from the GD 1 excavations indicated that fundamentally different processes of fossil record formation were occurring at Gondolin during the formation of the GD 1 and GD 2 fossil assemblages. This result highlighted the complex, heterogenous geologic processes that can influence fossil deposition and assemblage composition in South African cave systems during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. Fossil fauna The original description of fossil specimens from the GD 2 deposits only addressed a small portion of the assemblage. A single hominin tooth that was originally thought to have been derived from the GD 2 sampling was later determined to be an intrusive modern Homo tooth. A comprehensive reanalysis of the Gondolin GD 2 assemblage undertaken from 2002 to 2004 led to the identification of 95,549 total individual specimens (in contrast to the 90,663 specimens originally noted in 1993), of which 16,477 are identifiable craniodental (3,484) or postcranial (12,993) specimens; with the remaining 79,076 specimens being unidentifiable (primarily long bone diaphysis) fragments. The assemblage composition described from this reanalysis differs in key respects from that of the initial 1993 description, including significant shifts in the specimen counts attributed to individual taxonomic categories (both numbers of individual specimens and minimum numbers of individuals) and the removal of several species (Hippopotamus sp., Antidorcas australis/marsupialis, Procavia transvaalensis). The revised description of the GD 2 assemblage also reinforced several unique features of the collection compared to other South African late Pliocene and Pleistocene: * The numerical dominance of two rarely encountered antelope species - klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) and a species of reduncin (Redunca sp.) similar to the extant mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula). * The first described occurrence of the extinct porcupine (Hystrix makapanensis) from an assemblage other than the Makapansgat Member 3 deposits (including the first postcrania attributed to the species). * The first comprehensive taphonomic analysis of a South African early Pleistocene assemblage solely derived from in situ deposits. * A robust sample of directly associated cranial and postcranial remains for many fossil species, including several groupings of articulated fossils. * The recovery of fragile elements including hyoids and fetal/neonatal remains. * The absence of any identificable primate remains within the assemblage. Age of the deposits The Gondolin Palaeo-cave deposits have been dated using a combination of biostratigraphy and palaeomagnetism which indicate an age of around 1.8 million years.

The wedding ceremony, hosted by Miller's father, billionaire Robert Warren Miller, reportedly cost US$1.5 million and was attended by 1,400 guests. The wedding ceremony, receptions, and celebrations combined reportedly cost Miller $8 million. The wedding of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal brought together the largest gathering of royalty in London since Queen Elizabeth II married Prince Philip in 1947 and more crowned heads were in attendance than at the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. Pavlos, the eldest son of King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, was one of the first European heirs apparent of his generation to marry a commoner, which began a trend then followed by Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway; Willem- Alexander, Prince of Orange; Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden; Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice and Piedmont; and Pavlos's first cousins, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark and Felipe, Prince of Asturias. Background Pavlos and Marie-Chantal Miller were first introduced in 1992 on a blind date arranged by Alexander \\"Alecko\\" Papamarkou, a New York investment banker billionaire and the son of a former aide to Pavlos's grandfather King Paul of Greece. Prior to this encounter, Papamarkou had told Pavlos of Marie-Chantal, who was the daughter of his client, Robert Warren Miller. Papamarkou introduced the couple at the 40th birthday party for Philip Niarchos in New Orleans, which was given by Philip's father, Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos. According to Marie-Chantal in a 2008 Vanity Fair interview, \\"It was love at first sight. I knew that [Pavlos] was the person I would marry.‚Äù Papamarkou has traditionally been credited with \\"engineering\\" their marriage. Engagement Dual monogram of the couple Pavlos proposed marriage to Marie-Chantal on a ski lift in Gstaad, Switzerland over the Christmas holiday in 1994. Following the proposal, Pavlos formally asked Marie-Chantal's parents for their permission. King Constantine and Queen Anne- Marie officially announced the engagement from their residence in London on 11 January 1995. In his announcement, King Constantine added, \\"I am over the moon about this.\\" The same week as King Constantine's announcement, Pavlos and Marie-Chantal traveled to Fener in Istanbul, Turkey to be blessed by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople. Prior to their meeting with the Ecumenical Patriarch, Marie-Chantal announced that she would be converting from the Roman Catholic to the Greek Orthodox Church. Marie-Chantal was received into the Greek Orthodox Church on 22 May 1995 at St. Paul's Chapel in New York with Alecko Papamarkou acting as her godfather. Both the Greek Royal Family and the Miller family were in attendance. During their engagement, Pavlos was attending the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. where he received a master's degree in international relations and economics in May. While at Georgetown, Pavlos's roommate was his first cousin, Felipe, Prince of Asturias. Marie- Chantal was on leave as an art history major at New York University and attended courses at the Corcoran College of Art and Design to be closer to Pavlos. Celebrations and events The week before the wedding, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a tea party reception at Claridge's in Mayfair. Marie- Chantal's parents, Robert Warren Miller and his wife Chantal, hosted an extravagant pre-wedding champagne reception, dinner, and ball for between 1,200 and 1,300 guests two nights before the wedding at Wrotham Park, a Palladian mansion in Butter Green near Sevenoaks, Kent. Two giant marquees were erected on the grounds at Wrotham Park to resemble the Parthenon, which were decorated in blue and white, the national colors of Greece. The tent and marquees were designed by Robert Isabell, a last-minute addition to the wedding planning team when he was invited by Marie-Chantal's mother to save the Parthenon tent after a miscalculation in the amount of fabric. Chantal Miller asked, \\"Could [Isabell] come right away?\\" to which Isabell responded, \\"I‚Äôll take the Concorde and be there tomorrow. Get me a room at Claridge's, and we‚Äôll put this thing together.\\" For the party, Isabell conceived of the marquee steel structure with a floor of hand-stamped cork, a false linen ceiling, and pillars and a cornice that looked as if they were made of marble. After cocktails were finished, a white curtain behind the pillars was pulled back, and the guests walked through the arch to dinner, where large urns on laurel-wrapped pedestals each contained thousands of yellow and orange Ecuadoran roses. 100,000 flowers were flown in from Ecuador for the event. The lights that illuminated the field behind the tent were so extensive that they had to be cleared with London Heathrow Airport. Much of the scenery was fabricated in the United States and transported to England by an art shipper. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, drove himself to the reception in a Land Rover. Albert, Hereditary Prince of Monaco was also in attendance, but was unable to attend the wedding due to the private wedding ceremony for his younger sister, Princess St√©phanie of Monaco, and Daniel Ducruet in Monte Carlo on the same day. The reception continued until 4:00 a.m. when most of the remaining guests enjoyed a champagne breakfast. Pavlos's aunt Queen Margrethe II of Denmark traveled to London aboard Denmark's royal yacht, Dannebrog, which was moored on the River Thames at the Tower of London for the duration of her visit. Margrethe hosted a luncheon for Pavlos and Marie- Chantal aboard the Dannebrog with 100 guests in attendance. Before the couple's wedding, Marie-Chantal's father provided her with a ¬£200 million dowry. Wedding service The heavily publicized Greek Orthodox wedding ceremony, organized by Lady Elizabeth Anson, took place six months after the proposal on 1 July 1995 at St Sophia's Cathedral in Bayswater, London. The wedding ceremony was conducted in the Greek language and was led by Gregorios Theocharous, Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, and officiated by ten prelates. Lasting more than one hour, the wedding ceremony was attended by over 450 guests seated within the cathedral and another 850 guests, including the Queen Mother, seated at Hampton Court Palace where the ceremony was broadcast via satellite. The personal florist of the Danish Royal Family, Erik Bering, and six assistants decorated St Sophia's Cathedral with 30,000 pink flowers (lilies, peonies, and carnations) hung in garlands. =Clothing= Marie-Chantal's pearl-encrusted ivory silk wedding dress with a tulip-shaped front and 4.5 meter Chantilly lace train was made by Valentino Garavani and reportedly cost $225,000, as did her mother's and sisters' ensembles. Twenty-five people worked on Marie-Chantal's dress, which took four months and 12 different kinds of lace to complete. Valentino's Roman ateliers made 62 outfits for the wedding, including the dresses for Queen Sof√≠a of Spain, Infanta Cristina of Spain, Rosario, Princess of Preslav, and Empress Farah Pahlavi of Iran. Marie-Chantal also wore a diamond tiara lent to her by Pavlos's mother, Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. Pavlos and his groomsmen wore hand-tailored suits by Brioni of Rome.

In addition to the wedding service, Lady Elizabeth Anson also organized the catering, just as she did at the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981. Her brother, Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield, was the official photographer, as he had been for Charles and Diana. Colette Peters created the eight-tiered wedding cake, which was accompanied by 300 additional cakes, one per table. The cake's design was inspired by a china pattern from the Royal Collection. Valentino Garavani, the designer of Marie-Chantal's wedding dress, remarked \\"I have never been to such a beautifully arranged wedding--the flowers, the tables, the tent.\\" The cost of the dinner at Wortham Park and the Hampton Court Palace luncheon reception was reportedly $5 million. Political controversy in Greece Ten conservative New Democracy members of the Hellenic Parliament accepted invitations and attended the wedding ceremony, which sparked fierce controversy in Athens. Prime Minister of Greece Andreas Papandreou, a member of Greece's Panhellenic Socialist Movement political party, asked for the resignation of each member of Parliament who traveled to the wedding. Papandreou claimed that by attending the wedding, members of Parliament lent \\"tacit support\\" for the abolition of the Hellenic Republic and the restoration of the Kingdom of Greece. The wedding ceremony was televised live in Greece and attracted significant audiences on Greece's two leading channels. Opinion polls taken after the wedding revealed a boost in the popularity of the Greek Royal Family.

It has also been called mesenteric lipodystrophy, or retractile mesenteritis.  Signs and symptoms  Sclerosing mesenteritis may present with no or nearly no signs or symptoms, but many people have chronic and severe pain in the abdomen as the most common chief complaint. Other people have chronic problems with bowel movements, resulting in diarrhea, bloating, gas, and cramping which can range from severe to mild. The disorder is identified by histopathology showing fat necrosis, fibrosis and chronic inflammation of the small intestine. Examination of the mesentery may indicate a solitary mass, but diffuse mesentery thickening is common. It often mimics other abdominal diseases such as pancreatic or disseminated cancer. CT scanning is important for making the initial diagnosis. Mechanism Several causes of sclerosing mesenteritis have been suggested such as trauma, prior surgical procedures, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, IgG4-related disease, rheumatoid arthritis, infections such as tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, schistosomiasis, HIV and medicines such as paroxetine and pergolide but their associations with sclerosing mesenteritis are largely speculative with high degree of bias. Diagnosis CTscan In regards to the diagnosis of idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis, a CT scan which creates cross-section pictures of the affected individuals body, can help in the assessment of the disease. ‚ÄúMisty mesentery‚Äù is often used to describe increase in mesenteric fat density in sclerosing mesenteritis. Howver, it is not specific and can be found in other conditions such as mesenteric oedema, lymphedema, haemorrhage, and presence of neoplastic and inflammatory cells must be excluded. Mesenteric lymph nodes are rarely larger than 10 mm in sclerosing mesenteritis. Larger lymph nodes should prompt further investigations with PET scan or biopsy. MRI scan may show an intermediate T1 intensity and variable T2 intensity depending on degree of oedema and fibrosis. Presence of oedema causes high T2 signal while fibrosis causes low T2 signal. Treatment In terms of possible treatment for the condition of idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis, medications such as corticosteroids, tamoxifen and thalidomide have been used.  Epidemiology  The epidemiology of Idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis disease is extremely rare and has only been diagnosed in about an estimated 300 patients worldwide to date (as of 2014), it is probably under diagnosed. It can occur in children.  Research  Tamoxifen The Mayo Clinic in Rochester reported a large study of 92 patients, with widely ranging severity of their symptoms. The majority were male, with an average age of 65 years. They commonly had abdominal pain (70%), diarrhea (25%), and weight loss (23%). Depending on the stage of the scarring and fibrosis, several different treatments, including surgery for bowel obstruction, or drugs were used to halt the progression of the disease. In that case series, 56% of patients received only pharmacological therapy, most often receiving tamoxifen with a reducing dose of reducing prednisone, or also had colchicine, azathioprine or thalidomide. Their findings suggest that sclerosing mesenteritis can be debilitating although relatively benign. Symptomatic patients benefited from medical therapy, usually tamoxifen and prednisone, but further follow-up information would strengthen these results.

The company was founded in 1889 as Cameron Flavorings. In the early 1900s, the company began a relationship with Coca- Cola. The company had plants in Washington, Pennsylvania, Houston, Pennsylvania, Wheeling, West Virginia, and Canton, Ohio. In 1996, the company's facilities were converted to natural gas with a $124,000 grant by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The company operated by purchasing the syrup from Coca-Cola, mixing it, and distributing it to the surrounding areas. By the late 1990s, Cameron Coca-Cola was 10th largest Coke bottler and the second longest family-run Coke bottler in the nation. The company had a number of deals with local school districts where they paid thousands of dollars for exclusive rights to sell Coke on school premises. The deal with Hampton Township School District paid the district $40,000 ove seven years. The deal with Upper St. Clair School District paid the district $50,000 over five years. In the deal with Quaker Valley School District, Cameron agreed to buy several new scoreboards in exchange for the right to have their logo on the scoreboard and for exclusive rights to sell Coke on school premises. There was another exclusive deal with Woodland Hills School District. Cameron Coca-Cola sponsored championship harness racing at The Meadows Racetrack and Casino. The company was also a namesake sponsor of the Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Fair. Family and philanthropy The patriarch of the Cameron Family, Wilfred Cameron, died in 1999. The Cameron family have been closely connected to Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania for several decade. A number of Camerons attended the college, with three individuals serving on the Board of Trustees. Winnie Cameron, who served on the board of trustees, has been awarded the Alumni Distinguished Service Award and an honorary degree. In 1999, the family donated $2.65 million, one of the top 5 donations in the college history, to redesign and expand College Field, which was renamed Cameron Stadium. They also funded the digital scoreboard at Henry Memorial Center and Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium. In 2006, the family was awarded the Robert M. Murphy Award and inducted into the W&J; Athletic Hall of Fame. Sale to Coca-Cola Enterprises in 1998 In 1998, Cameron Coca-Cola Bottling was purchased by Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest Coke bottling company in the world. The deal, which coincided with the purchase of five other Coke bottlers, was part of a play by Coca-Cola Enterprises to consolidate Coke's distribution chain amid the Cola Wars against Pepsi. All told, the six deals cost Coca-Cola Enterprises $770 million in stock, cash, debt, and assumed debt. Later operations In 2008, following the sale, the Cameron operation moved to Kalama ‚Äì in Washington state but on the Columbia River near Portland, Oregon ‚Äì and was re-christened the Cameron Family Glass Packaging LLC, with the goal of producing wine bottles for the wine industry in the Western United States. There, the company built a wine bottling plant. The facility, which cost $109M to build, became the first new glass plant built in the nation in over 30 years to exclusively produce wine bottles. It became the largest such plant to be operated on an \\"eco-friendly\\" basis, with an electric furnace using hydroelectricity generated by the Columbia River. The plant provided wine bottles for a number of Washington wines, but had to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2009 due to a furnace failure that caused $12M in damages within a month of startup.

Sailing orders were open on the journey and as the large invasion convoy passed Ireland it made a turn towards the Mediterranean Sea to land troops at Bon (now Annaba), Tunisia, right on the doorstep of Axis held North Africa. However, at 2230hrs Friday 4 December whilst zig-zagging in the darkness as she entered the Mediterranean, she was involved in a serious collision and Boat Stations were immediately sounded and all troops onboard made preparations for the lifeboats. It was soon learned she had seriously damaged her bows and forty-five minutes later at 0015hrs on Saturday morning the all clear was given. However it was soon obvious she was unable to continue her journey to Bon. Instead she put into the nearest friendly port, arriving several hours later in Gibraltar at 0730hrs. The Lothians and Border Horse Yeomanry hastily unloaded their heavy armoured cargo at 2100hrs on the evening of 5 December. Under great pressure to keep up with the Allied invasion fleet, of which they were to be the spearhead of the invasion force at Bon, four and half hours later had fully loaded all their tanks and equipment in the Llanstephan Castle.

The Constitution created a unitary state governed by three branches of government: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The executive branch was led by the President of Liberia, elected by popular vote of all land-owning citizens to a two-year term. Legislative power was held by the Legislature of Liberia, a bicameral body made up of a House of Representatives and a Senate. The judicial branch consisted of the Supreme Court of Liberia, made up of a chief justice and four associate justices, and circuit courts created by the Legislature. Article One of the Constitution enshrined civil liberties similar to those protected by the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution. Approved in a referendum on 27 September 1847, the Constitution was amended several times from 1847 to 1980.

In Hollywood he began to be cast in Commercials and Music videos such as Reebok, David Guetta, and many more. Also for \\"The Giant Mechanical Man\\" a NYC Tribeca Festival movie as a choreographer and dance stunt. In 2010, he became more widely known to American audiences when he was selected as one of the semi-finalists for the fifth season of the NBC television program America's Got Talent. He is also one of the finalists for the 5th season of the French television program \\"La France a un Incroyable talent\\" airing on M6. In 2011 and 2012 Haspop appeared on many Tv shows around the world such as \\"Beat the Best\\", \\" Arabs Got Talent\\", \\"La Meilleure Danse\\", \\"Istanbul Cabaret Show\\" In 2012 Haspop started the 9th season of the French tv show Star Academy as the choreographer. Star Academy is a three-month competition in which Haspop had a pivotal role as a judge and teacher counselor. In early 2013 Haspop began the creation of the new Cirque Du Soleil Las Vegas project called \\"LIGHT\\", as the Artistic director and choreographer. Until early 2015 Haspop worked with a cast of 20 dancers and aerialists creating new shows every other season, with the groundbreaking technology of 3D Mapping Led screens and interactive video, at LIGHT he worked closely with DJs such as Alesso, Nicky Romero, Disclosure & Skrillex, former members of Swedish House Mafia: Axwell & Ingrosso, video content producers Moment Factory. Producing events for Iheart Radio, Beats by DRE, Dreamworks, Baauer Studio B. In 2015 until March 2016 took a vital role in addressing one of the world‚Äôs most important causes‚Äîsafe and sustainable water access‚Äîby assuming the position of Conceptor and Creator for the 4th annual show One Night for ONE DROP imagined by Cirque du Soleil. The show \\"Amanzi\\" was based on his own personal story and was performed for 2 preview performances and one night only Gala on March 18th 2016 at the Smith Center for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas. With more than 7000 spectators and more than 100 performing artists volunteering their time and artistry, the show event was a success, as US$ 6.5 million were raised for the One Drop organization. Early life He was born Hassan El Hajjami on August 1, 1977, in Lyon, France, to a family of modest means. From the ages of ten to twenty, he pursued the career of boxing, while at the same time earning a Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle in plastering and masonry. After asking a friend who was a street dancer to teach him some dance moves, Haspop turned his attention to dance. In 1999, he founded the hip-hop dance group, the Pockemon Crew, and went on to win a series of competitions, both on his own and with his group. In 2003, he was the individual champion in France for Popping, and then in 2004, he won the European title. In 2003 and 2004, the Pockemon Crew won French, world and European championships in hip-hop, including first place at Battle of the Year 2003. In 2005, he was invited by Cirque du Soleil to audition and was accepted. Unable to bring his two children (whom as of 2010 he visited routinely), he performed in the United States for Cirque du Soleil from 2005 to 2009 in the Love show in Las Vegas in the role of the \\"Walrus.\\" In 2009, he decided to leave the Cirque, but with the challenges of the economic recession returned to street performance, residing in Santa Monica, until, in June 2010, he began his participation in America's Got Talent. Career Hassan began to box at a young age at his father's request. He quickly excelled at the sport, going on to become an inter-club champion in France. One lazy afternoon he went to see a friend of his, a hip hop dancer who had performed in the town square in Lyon. Hassan became intrigued by the wild style of hip hop dancing. He was immediately addicted. His parents are devout Muslims and dancing is frowned upon in his culture, but it was something Hassan couldn't ignore. He began to learn from his friends and was a natural, quickly becoming a popping sensation. He became the Popping Champion of France, then Europe, then the World, as he created his own self-taught style he called Has-Pop Style. One day at work, a colleague brought his father a newspaper stating that Hassan was Champion of France. Hassan's father immediately thought it was for boxing, until his colleague corrected him. It was for dancing. Hassan's father was less than thrilled until he spoke to his son and learned that Hassan was making a very nice living from dance, while helping to support his parents and three brothers. A friend who had auditioned for Cirque du Soleil in Paris was asked if he knew anyone that specialized in popping. Hassan was summoned, completely baffled as to why a circus would want a popping dancer to perform among their animals. After the audition, he went back to France to be with his wife, who was giving birth to his daughter. While she was in labor, he received a call from Cirque. The doctor went ballistic, but Hassan knew it was the call he'd been waiting for. He was cast as The Walrus, the lead dancer and principal character for \\"Love.\\" The birth of his daughter Ines and his career happened at the same time. Hassan and family moved to Montreal to prep the show, and then to Las Vegas, where he became the star of \\"Love.\\" Hassan infuses his dance style with a signature undercurrent of comedy and playfulness, which not only wows audiences but entertains in a way that straight dancing rarely does. Whether performing across the globe for Cirque Du Soleil or busking on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, Hassan has never forgotten his humble beginning, his simple roots, nor his passion for hip hop dancing. America's Got Talent Haspop auditioned for the fifth season of America's Got Talent in Los Angeles, which aired on June 1, 2010. The three judges, Howie Mandel, Piers Morgan, and Sharon Osbourne, unanimously voted him forward to the next round in Las Vegas. Once he reached Las Vegas, the judges selected him as among the 10 acts to move directly to the quarterfinals in Hollywood without having to compete in another round of eliminations. A total of 48 acts were ultimately selected for the quarterfinals in Hollywood. In Hollywood, he was in the third batch of 12 quarter finalists who performed live on July 27, 2010. The judges gave him positive reviews, with Howie Mandel commenting that \\"That is what I'm talking about. That is wow! It really is wow, Haspop!\\" Piers Morgan added that he thought Haspop's was \\"the performance of the night, so far.\\" Sharon Osbourne agreed with the other two judges, stating that the performance was \\"spectacular, absolutely spectacular.\\" On July 28, 2010, Haspop was voted by the viewers to move to the semifinals.

History In 1900, Josiah White III bought a parcel of land between Ohio Avenue and Park Place on the Boardwalk, and built the Queen Anne style Marlborough House. The hotel was financially successful and, in 1905, he chose to expand. White hired Philadelphia architect Will Price of Price and McLanahan to design a new, separate tower to be called the Blenheim. \\"Blenheim\\" refers to Blenheim Palace in England, the ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill, a grandson of the Duke of Marlborough. Recent hotel fires in and around Atlantic City, Price's recent experience of designing the all- concrete Jacob Reed store in Philadelphia, and a steel strike in the fall of 1905 influenced Price's choice of reinforced concrete for the tower. It opened in 1906. It was not the first reinforced concrete hotel in the world, as French concrete pioneer Fran√ßois Hennebique had designed the Imperial Palace Hotel in Nice five years previously. But it was the largest reinforced concrete building in the world.Concrete: the vision of a new architecture By Peter Collins The hotel's Spanish and Moorish themes, capped off with its signature dome and chimneys, represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence. In 1916, Winston Churchill was a guest of the hotel. In 1977 Reese Palley and local attorney and businessman Martin Blatt bought the Marlborough-Blenheim and planned to preserve the Blenheim half of the hotel, along with adjacent Dennis Hotel for his Park Place Casino. Palley was successful in getting the Blenheim part of the hotel placed on the National Register of Historic Buildings, while planning to raze the Marlborough to make way for a new modern hotel. Ten days later, he stepped aside when Bally Manufacturing purchased a controlling interest in the project. After Bally took control, they announced plans to raze the Marlborough-Blenheim and the adjacent Dennis Hotel, despite protests, to make way for the new \\"Bally's Park Place Casino and Hotel\\". However, in an effort to offset costs and get the casino opened as fast as they could they chose to keep the Dennis Hotel, which would serve as the temporary hotel for Bally's until a new tower was built. Bally demolished the wood-framed Marlborough with the conventional wrecking ball. For the Blenheim the company hired Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) and Winzinger Incorporated of Hainesport New Jersey, which had taken down the Traymore Hotel, to implode the structure. A preservation group which had sought historic status for the building won a stay of execution for the Blenheim's rotunda portion on the Boardwalk. It was separated from the rest of the hotel, which was imploded in the fall of 1978. Several months later its historic status was denied, the stay was lifted, and CDI finished the demolition January 4, 1979. It is not known if they sold the name Marlborough-Blenheim as well. Bally's Park Place now stands at this location. In culture The hotel features prominently in the 1972 Bob Rafelson film The King of Marvin Gardens, starring Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern and Ellen Burstyn. In the Garry Marshall film Beaches, a young Hillary Whitney stays with her family at the hotel, where she treats a young C. C. Bloom to chocolate sodas in the Garden Court. The scene was filmed at the Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles). In the HBO television show Boardwalk Empire, the fictionalized Nucky Thompson lives on the 8th floor of a Ritz-Carlton whose architecture is based on the Marlborough-Blenheim's, rather than that of the actual Ritz-Carlton in Atlantic City that the real Nucky Johnson had lived in. The Blenheim hotel is mentioned throughout the series. A clip of the demolition of the main dome of the hotel is featured in the video for Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Atlantic City.\\" See also *List of tallest buildings in Atlantic City Winzinger Inc. of Hainesport, New Jersey was the demolition contractor of the hotels along with CDI who controlled and planned the explosives. Heidi Winzinger's song \\"Queen of Atlantic City\\" is a folk rock song dedicated to the Blenheim Hotel's memory.

One example of the success of this policy is Great Britain defender Emily Maguire, who learned her hockey with the club over 15 years from the age of 5, before moving south to train full-time with the GB squad. The men's first team was the team of the 1990s, winning GB and Ireland Championship, four National League titles, Scottish Cup and European competitions.

Square Mile India  During his time as Vice-Chancellor Shellard conceived and oversaw the launch of Square Mile India, an initiative created to ‚Äúhelp improve the lives of thousands of India‚Äôs poorest and most vulnerable families‚Äù. To do this, many students from the university would travel to Ahmedebad, Gujarat, to work with the community in the city‚Äôs largest slum, home to 160,000 people. Whilst they were there, the students focussed on improving the infrastructure of the slum sustainably, by introducing the use of solar power and intelligent electricity systems to ensure energy would be used efficiently. They also worked closely with these communities to ‚Äúhelp people needing treatment for eyesight and hearing problems, and to use art, education and psychology training to improve community life‚Äù, as well as building homes for families affected by leprosy, work on projects to improve sanitation, design anti-microbial pillows for children to sleep on and help improve literacy and numeracy skills. In 2013, the Gandhi Global Family, a United Nations NGO, presented Prof Shellard with the Mahatma Gandhi Seva Medal for services to society.

The campus transformation included the new Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Leisure Centre, a new complex for the Faculty of Art and Design, the Vijay Patel Building, a conference centre, a new sportsground and a new ‚Äògreen lung‚Äô, a large series of landscaped open spaces at the heart of the university. Pay and benefits In January 2019, Shellard came under public scrutiny regarding a 22.3 percent increase in his remuneration over that of the previous year, following the award of the prestigious TEF Gold status for the university. His remuneration for the academic year 2017-18 consisted of a ¬£350,000 salary (2016‚Äì17; ¬£286,000), ¬£1,000 in health benefits, and ¬£6,000 in pension contributions. Other benefits included Ivy Club membership. In 2018 it emerged that Shellard had business links with the Chair of The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Governors Shellard was paid an additional ¬£270,000, the equivalent of 9 months pay, when he resigned from the university in 2019. The Office for Students launched a formal investigation of De Montfort University following the resignation; the report concluded that there had been serious failings in governance, including oversight of The Vice-Chancellor.  Business interests  Shellard is a Director of Theseus Global Limited, Theseus Global (Education) Limited, and Acetute Limited. Personal life Shellard was one of the very few openly gay Vice-Chancellors. He is also a fan of QPR, an English Football League club.

Founded in 1984, MUT's main campus is located at Tehran, the capital of Iran. Its other campuses are located in Isfahan and Urmia. The university is named after Malik al-Ashtar, one of the most loyal companions of Ali Ibn Abi Talib. MUT provides both undergraduate and graduate programs. It is organized into more than twenty schools, colleges, and institutes, located in six centers throughout Lavizan in Tehran, Shahin Shahr in Isfahan province, Karaj in Alborz province, Fereydunkenar in Mazandaran province, Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan province and Urmia. The United Nations, the European UnionCouncil Regulation (EU) No 267/2012 of 23 March 2012 concerning restrictive measures against Iran and repealing Regulation (EU) No 961/2010 and American officials believe the university is involved in the nuclear program of Iran and that it has served as a cover for the organization responsible for the manufacturing of nuclear warheads. The university is not open to visitors and inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency have not been allowed to interview staff. The university has been under sanctions from the United Nations and from the European Union. Exiled Iranian opposition groups have claimed the university has assisted in developing biological weapons. History In late 1981, the Iranian government brought together all military-industrial units and placed them under the Defense Industries Organization (DIO). By 1984, a large number of infantry rifles, machine guns, and mortars and some small-arms ammunition were being manufactured locally. They also established three universities to educate experts for Iran's industrial and research centers: Imam Hossein University, Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University, and Malek- Ashtar University. Malek Ashtar University of Technology was approved in 1984 by the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. It was then recognized as a university in 1984. Campuses MUT had only one campus in Shahinshahr, Isfahan. In 1999, another campus was established in Tehran and known as main campus. Its faculties include aerospace engineering, applied sciences, electrical engineering, management and industrial engineering, marine sciences and engineering, materials and manufacturing technologies and information, communications and security technologies, and rector as of 2006. Research = Aerospace research = Malek Ashtar University of Technology is among top five public universities in Iran that provide aerospace research and programs at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. (These universities includes K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Malek-Ashtar University of Technology. The Sharif University of Technology was the first university with an Aerospace Engineering degree since 1987. The K.N. Toosi University of Technology offered Ph.D in Aerospace Engineering in a joint program with Moscow State Aviation Technological University in Russia. In 2003, Iranian Space Agency was established in an uninhabited desert area in Semnan Province, southeast of Tehran. The Aerospace Research Institute affiliated to the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology is active organization in the space science and technology applications. Five public universities, one private university (Azad University Science and Research Branch), and one college (Civil Aviation Technology College) provide higher education and research in aerospace engineering. Since the 1990s, Iran started to develop a launch vehicle based on Shahab-3. The Iran Space Research Center started testing launch capabilities since early 2007 reaching 150‚Äì200 km altitude based on Shahab-3 series. In 2008, they developed a two-stage launch vehicle Safir-1. In 2009, they launched a satellite named Omid into orbit using the domestically built launch vehicle Safir-2. = Biological research = According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report on the biological activities in Iran, genetic cloning is being carried out at the Malek Ashtar University of Technology. The Iran's activities about biological weapons began in 1985. By 1986, they established a research center in Tehran's Pasteur Institute to work on toxic fungus and microbial substances. The center succeeded in producing toxic fungus, and aflatoxin. In 1987, they moved the facilities to the Imam Hossein University. A number of foreign experts from China, North Korea, India, and Russia have cooperated with the Ministry of Defense of Iran. The Research Center for Direct Biotechnology, which does not directly work on microbial weapons, is used as the center for biological researches and actively works with the Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, and Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University. However, the Centers for Science and Technological Growth of the Biological Research Center of the Malek-Ashtar University of Technology, affiliated with the defense industries, are in charge of mass production of biological weapons. =Chemical research= According to Iranian opposition groups, Malek Ashtar University of Technology uses the center for chemical research and chemical engineering located in west of Tehran for a joint study with Imam Hossein University. The opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran (affiliated with People's Mujahedin of Iran, a.k.a. MKO) has claimed that since 1999, Imam Hossein University has been involved in chemical research in a much larger scale. One of groups linked to this university produces a significant amount of nerve gas in liquid, vapor, and powder form. According to the opposition group, Sina Industry (Vira Laboratories) with more than 4,000 employees is another Organization run by the Defense Ministry. It is involved in producing chemical products. The Parchin Chemical Industries located in south of Tehran, is another center of chemical products. Another complex manufacturer near the city of Semnan is also engaged in producing nerve gas.

It is a horizontally scrolling shooter which borrows gameplay from Defender re-themed to involve sheep. The title screen features an arrangement of Bach's \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" by pianist James Lisney. Gameplay The player controls a small flying sheep and has the task of defending the planet by shooting down aliens, and preventing them from charging up their \\"planet buster\\" gun. Like Llamasoft's 1984 release Ancipital, the game makes use of multiple gravitational fields - there is a landscape across the bottom of the screen as per a normal shoot 'em up, but also an inverted one across the top. If the player is in the centre of the screen, the projectiles the sheep fires fly straight. Getting closer to the land at the top or the bottom of the screen will cause the projectiles to curve up or down respectively, allowing the shooting of aliens close to the surface. Proximity to the upper and lower surfaces also affects movement speed which becomes slower when near either surface. The player can land the sheep on areas of grass on either the top or bottom of the screen, in order to reduce its hunger. A stomach meter shows the player's current state of hunger - overfeeding or allowing the sheep to starve will result in the loss of a life. Feeding also replenishes the sheep's shields. Destroying all of the aliens advances the player to the next level, which has different topography and is slightly more difficult. There are 48 levels in total. Influenced games and clones Just as Sheep in Space was influenced by Defender, it in turn inspired the Sensible Software title Insects in Space.

The character is an ancient cosmic evil which preys upon the children of Derry, Maine, roughly every 27 years, using a variety of powers that include the ability to shapeshift, manipulate reality, and go unnoticed by adults. During the course of the story, It primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown. King stated in a 2013 interview that he came up with the idea for Pennywise after asking himself what scared children \\"more than anything else in the world\\", and feeling that the answer was clowns. King thought of a troll like the one in the children's tale \\"Three Billy Goats Gruff\\", who inhabited a sewer system. The character was portrayed in its Pennywise form by Tim Curry in the 1990 television adaptation, in the 1998 television adaptation by Lilliput, and by Bill Skarsg√•rd in the 2017 film adaptation and its 2019 sequel It Chapter Two, which was released on September 6, 2019. Appearances =Literature= In the novel, It is a shapeshifting monster who usually takes the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, originating in a void containing and surrounding the Universe‚Äîa place referred to in the novel as the \\"Macroverse\\". It arrived on Earth during an asteroid impact and made its home under the land that Derry would be built on, initially preying on indigenous tribes. It would sleep for millions of years, then, when humans appeared in Derry, would fall into a 27-year slumber and wake for about a year in order to feed on human fear, often assuming the shape of what its prey fear the most. It has a preference for children since their fears are easier to interpret and adults are harder to scare, in a physical form. It can manipulate people with weaker wills, making them indifferent to the horrific events that unfold or even serve as accomplices. In the novel, It claims that its true name is Robert \\"Bob\\" Gray, and is named \\"It\\" by the Losers Club. Throughout the book, It is generally referred to as male due to usually appearing as Pennywise. The Losers come to believe It may be female (because it lays eggs), and perceiving It's true form as a monstrous giant spider. However, It's true appearance is briefly observed by Bill Denbrough via the Ritual of Ch√ºd as a mass of swirling destructive orange lights known as \\"deadlights\\", which inflict insanity or death on any living being that sees them directly. The only person to survive the ordeal is Bill's wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered temporarily catatonic by the experience. It's natural enemy is the \\"Space Turtle\\" or \\"Maturin\\", another ancient dweller of King's \\"Macroverse\\" who, eons ago, created the known universe and possibly others by vomiting them out as the result of a stomachache. The Turtle appears again in King's series The Dark Tower. Wizard and Glass, one of the novels in the series, suggests that It, along with the Turtle, are themselves creations of a separate, omnipotent creator referred to as \\"the Other\\" (possibly Gan, who is said to have created the various universes where King's novels take place). Throughout the novel It, some events are depicted from Pennywise's point of view, describing itself as a \\"superior\\" being, with the Turtle as an equal and humans as mere \\"toys\\". It's hibernation begins and ends with horrific events, like the mysterious disappearance of the Derry Township's 300 settlers in 1740-43 or the ironworks explosion. It awoke during a great storm that flooded part of the city in 1957, with Bill's younger brother Georgie the first in a line of killings before the Losers Club fight the monster, a confrontation culminating in Bill using the Ritual of Ch√ºd to severely wound It and force It into hibernation. Continually surprised by the Losers' victory, It briefly questions its superiority before claiming that they were only lucky, as the Turtle is working through them. It is finally destroyed 27 years later in the second Ritual of Ch√ºd, and an enormous storm damages the downtown part of Derry to symbolize It's death. Pennywise makes a tangential appearance in King's 2011 novel 11/22/63, in which protagonist Jake Epping meets a couple of the children from It, asks them about a recent murder in their town, and learns that the murderer apparently \\"wasn't the clown.\\" It also appears to Jake in the old ironworks, where it taunts Jake about \\"the rabbit-hole,\\" referring to the time portal in which Jake moves from one time to another. =Film and television= In the 1990 miniseries, Pennywise is portrayed by English actor Tim Curry. One original guise is made for the miniseries: Ben Hanscom's deceased father (played by Steve Makaj). In the 2017 film adaptation and its 2019 sequel It Chapter Two, Pennywise is portrayed by Swedish actor Bill Skarsg√•rd. The second movie slightly deviates from the book in It's final form being a drider-version of Pennywise and is motivated by revenge on the Losers Club. Will Poulter was originally cast as Pennywise, with Curry describing the role as a \\"wonderful part\\" and wishing Poulter the best of luck, but dropped out of the production due to scheduling conflicts and first film's original director Cary Fukunaga leaving the project. Spanish actor Javier Botet was cast as the Hobo leper in both movies and the monstrous form of Ms. Kersh in the second film. Two original guises were made for the first film: the Headless Boy, a burnt victim of the Kitchener Ironworks incident (played by Carter Musselman), and the Amedeo Modigliani‚Äìbased painting Judith (played by Tatum Lee). Pennywise is loosely adapted in the 1998 Indian television series Woh as a specter who was originally an outcast named Vikram, portrayed by actor Lilliput. Pennywise will also appear as a supporting character in the upcoming live-action/animated film Space Jam: A New Legacy, which will also be distributed by Warner Bros. Reception and legacy Several media outlets such as The Guardian have spoken of the character, ranking it as one of the scariest clowns in film or pop culture. The Atlantic said of the character; \\"the scariest thing about Pennywise, though, is how he preys on children's deepest fears, manifesting the monsters they're most petrified by (something J. K. Rowling would later emulate with boggarts).\\" British scholar Mikita Brottman has also said of the miniseries version of Pennywise; \\"one of the most frightening of evil clowns to appear on the small screen\\" and that it \\"reflects every social and familial horror known to contemporary America\\". Author Darren Shan cited Pennywise as an inspiration behind the character Mr. Dowling in his 12.5 book serial Zom-B. Critics such as Mark Dery have drawn connections between the character of Pennywise and serial killer John Wayne Gacy, who would dress up at community children's parties as \\"Pogo the Clown\\"; Dery has stated that the character \\"[embodied] our primal fears in a sociopathic Ronald McDonald who oozes honeyed guile\\". King, however makes no mention of Gacy in discussing his inspiration for It. The American punk rock band Pennywise took its name from the character. =Association with 2016 clown sightings= The character was suggested as a possible inspiration for two incidents of people dressing up as clowns in Northampton, England and Staten Island, New York, both during 2014. In 2016, appearances of \\"evil clowns\\" were reported by the media, including nine people in Alabama charged with \\"clown-related activity\\". Several newspaper articles suggested that the character of Pennywise was an influence, which led to King commenting that people should react less hysterically to the sightings and not take his work seriously. The first reported sighting of people dressed as evil clowns in Greenville, South Carolina was by a small boy spoke to his mother of a pair of clowns that had attempted to lure him away. Additional creepy clown sightings were reported in other parts of South Carolina. Evil clowns were reported in several other U.S. states including North Carolina, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming Later the same year, \\"clown sightings\\" were reported in Great Britain, Australia, and Latin America. One hypothesis for the wave of 2016 clown sightings was a viral marketing campaign, possibly for the Rob Zombie film 31 (2016). A spokesperson for New Line Cinema (distributor of the 2017 film adaptation of It) released a statement claiming that \\"New Line is absolutely not involved in the rash of clown sightings.\\" See also *Apex predator *Evil clown *Joker *Monster *Tsuchigumo References External links *It on IMDb Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century Category:Literary characters introduced in 1986 Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities Category:Fictional child killers Category:Fictional clowns Category:Fictional extraterrestrial characters Category:Fictional monsters Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional shapeshifters Category:Fictional spiders Category:Fictional anthropophages Category:Fictional telepaths Category:Fictional torturers Category:Horror television characters Category:Stephen King characters Category:Literary villains Category:Horror film villains Category:It (novel) Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017 Category:Psychopathy in fiction ","title":"It (character)"},{"id":"28220631","title":"Venues of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics"},{"id":"28220633","text":"In physiology, aldosterone escape is a term that has been used to refer to two distinct phenomena involving aldosterone that are exactly opposite each other: #Escape from the sodium-retaining effects of excess aldosterone (or other mineralocorticoids) in primary hyperaldosteronism, manifested by volume and/or pressure natriuresis. #The inability of ACE inhibitor therapy to reliably suppress aldosterone release, for example, in patients with heart failure or diabetes, usually manifested by increased salt and water retention. This latter sense may rather be termed refractory hyperaldosteronism. In patients with hyperaldosteronism, chronic exposure to excess aldosterone does not cause edema as might be expected. Aldosterone initially results in an increase in Na+ reabsorption in these patients through stimulation of ENaC channels in principal cells of the renal collecting tubules. Increased ENaC channels situated in the apical membranes of the principal cells allow for more Na+ reabsorption, which may cause a transient increase in fluid reabsorption as well. However, within a few days, Na+ reabsorption returns to normal as evidenced by normal urinary Na+ levels in these patients. The proposed mechanism for this phenomenon does not include a reduced sensitivity of mineralocorticoid receptors to aldosterone, because low serum potassium is often seen in these patients, which is the direct result of aldosterone- induced expression of ENaC channels. Furthermore, electrolyte homeostasis is maintained in these patients, which excludes the possibility that other Na+ transporters elsewhere in the kidney are being shut down. If, in fact, other transporters such as the Na+-H+ antiporter in the proximal tubule or the Na+/K+/2Cl‚àí symporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle were being blocked, other electrolyte disturbances would be expected, such as seen during use of diuretics. Instead, experiments isolating the perfusion pressures seen by glomerular capillaries from heightened systemic pressures due to hyperaldosteronism have shown that Na+ excretion remains minimal until the kidney is exposed to heightened perfusion pressures. These experiments brought about the proposition that initially high perfusion pressures due to increased Na+ and water reabsorption in a hyperaldosterone state actually causes \\"backflow\\" of Na+ and water into the tubules. Normally Na+ and water are reabsorbed from the tubules and dumped into the interstitium. From there, Starling forces dictate the gradient for movement of water and Na+ into the peritubular capillaries. Because hydrostatic pressures in the tubules, interstitium and peritubular capillaries are normally equivalent, oncotic pressures govern flow. Typically, oncotic pressures are higher in the peritubular capillaries, because protein composition in the interstitium is nominal; therefore, Na+ and water leave the interstitial space and enter the capillaries. When hydrostatic pressures are raised in the peritubular capillaries such as seen in hyperaldosteronism, Starling forces begin to favor \\"backflow\\" of Na+ and water from the interstitium into the tubules‚Äîthus, increasing Na+ excretion. This is the proposed mechanism of \\"mineralocorticoid escape\\" for how patients with increased levels of aldosterone are able to maintain Na+ balance and avoid an edematous state.

He owned his ship until it was captured by the British, following which he became a sealer and adventurer. Captain P√©ron reports that he was marooned three years (from 1792 to 1795) on New Amsterdam Island or √éle Amsterdam. He wrote an account about being marooned for 40 months gathering sealskins on that lonely Southern Indian Ocean island. There was confusion in the early days between Amsterdam and Saint Paul Islands. In February 1793 Sir George Staunton was on his way to China on as secretary to the Macartney embassy on the East Indiaman Hindostan. At √éle Amsterdam they found a sealer named Perron and 4 others on the southern of the two islands, now called Saint Paul Island. Later, Lion captured the French ship Em√©lie, the vessel that had landed the sealers. Deprived of the ship that had landed them, P√©ron and his men spent some 40 months marooned on the island until Captain Thomas Hadley, in , rescued them in late 1795 and took them to Port Jackson.Earnshaw (1959), pp.23-24. After being rescued, P√©ron travelled via Tasmania to the convict settlement at Sydney Cove. While in Sydney P√©ron found that the store of seal skins he left behind had been brought in the American maritime fur trade ship . He negotiated with the captain, Ebenezer Dorr (\\"Dawes\\") and was given the post of first officer until the skins were sold in China. Otter then engaged in the sealskin and fur transport from the American Pacific coast to China. While leaving Sydney, P√©ron assisted in the escape of Thomas Muir of Huntershill, a Scottish lawyer tried in 1793 in Edinburgh for sedition and sentenced to transportation to New South Wales in 1794. P√©ron's chronicles describe the escape and the voyage across the Pacific. The Otter then became the first known European merchant vessel to visit Tonga where several escaped convicts landed. After sighting Niue, the Otter reached Pukapuka on 3 April 1796. Peron, Thomas Muir and a small party landed ashore but the inhabitants did not allow them to inspect the island. Trading later took place near the ship as adzes, mats and other artifacts were exchanged for knives and European goods. Thomas Muir This island was given the name \\"Isles de la Loutre\\" (Otter Islands) by P√©ron: \\"Everything united to convince us that we had the right to attribute to ourselves the honour of having discovered three new islands; and with this conviction I gave them the name of Otter Islands [Isles de la Loutre] which was the name of our vessel. In order to distinguish them we named the eastern one 'Peron and Muir' (Motu Ko), the one to the north 'Dorr' (Pukapuka), and the name of 'Brown' (Motu Kotowa) was given to the third, after one of our officers.\\" Peron From Pukapuka the Otter sailed to Nootka Sound where furs were obtained and Muir was transferred to the Spanish vessel Sutil under Jos√© Tobar y Tamariz and taken to Monterey where he was received by governor Diego Borica. In his accounts, P√©ron writes about the Pacific Northwest and its natives, as well as an interesting account about the Hawaiian Islands. Most notable is a visit to California, by then a Spanish colony, including a stay at Monterey in 1796. This was the first time an American ship stopped in California. P√©ron found Monterey somewhat backward at the time. P√©ron then travelled to San Blas, Mexico City, Veracruz, Havana, and C√°diz, finally reaching France. In 1804 P√©ron retired to his chateau in Piage. He was appointed mayor in 1805 and again in 1815, but in 1825 he settled in Saumur, where he became first deputy mayor until 1830. P√©ron's Memoires, in which he describes his survival alone on √éle Amsterdam, were published in a limited edition and are now an expensive collectors' item. His account contains notes on British Columbia, Vancouver Island, and the Queen Charlotte Islands, descriptions of California, particularly of his visit to Monterey in 1796, Tasmania and New South Wales in Australia, Hawaii and Sumatra. His memoires include descriptions of storms, shipwrecks, as well as situations of misery and hardship of all kinds. P√©ron‚Äôs memoirs are well- written and described many interesting events in the life of a sea captain who travelled in most of the then still little-known world where Western commerce was fast developing. P√©ron died in 1846 at Luynes.Archives d√©partementales d'Indre-et-Loire, numerised vital records of Luynes, death act N¬∞60, 25 october 1846.

Mosman is located 8 kilometres north-east of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Municipality of Mosman. Localities In February 1997, a notice was published in the Government Gazette by Mosman Council advising that they had assigned Mosman as the only suburb in the Mosman Local Government Area. However, Mosman Council decided that residents should continue to be allowed to use the following traditional locality names if they wished:Mosman Municipal Council - Ordinary Meeting Agenda - Meeting Date: 29 November 2005 pg 83. * Balmoral * Beauty Point * Clifton Gardens * Georges Heights * Spit Junction * The Spit History Mosman is named after Archibald Mosman (1799-1863) and his twin brother George, who moved onto a land grant in the area in 1831. They were involved in shipping, and founded a whaling station on a bay in the harbour, which became known as Mosman's Bay. George subsequently became involved in grazing, but Archibald continued with whaling activities. By 1838, he owned along the Mosman waterfront.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 181 Archibald was buried in the cemetery of St Jude's Church, Randwick. His grave is maintained by Mosman Council. Arthur Streeton, Mosman's Bay, 1914 =Aboriginal culture= Mosman was originally inhabited by the Borogegal tribe. Bungaree (c. 1775-1830) was a well known Aboriginal who joined British explorers on voyages, including circumnavigating Australia with Matthew Flinders when he was 26. He later became leader of his tribe, was given land at Georges Head, and enjoyed the patronage of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He greeted newcomers whose ships entered Port Jackson, and became acquainted with Russian and French explorers. His image was painted many times and shown in London, Paris, and Moscow. =European settlement= A gun emplacement at Middle Head Fort In 1789 --the flagship of the First Fleet--entered what is now known as Mosman Bay or Great Sirius Cove. Mosman has been the site of important maritime and defence installations for Sydney since 1801, especially when Sydney's Harbour defences were expanded with the construction of Middle Head Fort, Georges Head Battery and Bradleys Head Fortification Complex. In 1871 the Beehive Casemate was constructed into the cliff side on Obelisk Bay. A Submarine Miners‚Äô Depot was constructed at Chowder Bay (Georges Head) in the 1880s. In 1888 the site was modified for the latest in harbour defences. The site was a strategic position and considered the best place to observe and fire mines which were laid underwater. Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners (Clifton Gardens). From Georges Head, miners watched for ships entering the harbour. Their job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship. Each underwater mine was attached to an electric cable that ran up the cliff to the firing post.Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Sites - Headland Park Army - The Soldiers' Newspaper During a demonstration in 1891, a crowd of several thousand people watched as a fatal accident killed four miners and injured another eight. John Mather, 1889 In the 1880s and 1890s, as a result of the enthusiasm for painting en plein air fostered by the Barbizon and Impressionist movements in France, art colonies known as the Sydney artists' camps flourished around the Harbour, mainly in the Mosman area.Robin Tranter, Artists' camps, Dictionary of Sydney, 2008. Retrieved 9 May 2011 As a result, Mosman became known as \\"Australia's most painted suburb\\".John Huxley, Back to the wellspring of inspiration, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 December 2005. Retrieved 14 January 2010 Notable painters in this community included Julian Ashton, Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and John Mather. One such camp was known as Curlew Camp and was situated in Little Sirius Cove. An inscription on a rock can still be seen on the east side of the cove: Curlew 1890. In 1942 during the Second World War the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was constructed on Georges Head and was designed to prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a boom net winch house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay. On the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines attempted to enter Sydney Harbour in what became known as the Attack on Sydney Harbour.Gill, George Hermon (1968). Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, p 65Stevens, David (2005). A Critical Vulnerability, p 193 One of the Japanese midget submarines became entangled in the boom net and after unsuccessful attempts by the crew to free the submarine they detonated charges within the sub, killing themselves and destroying their sub in the process. The 1916 James Barry Zoo entrance building Chowder Bay was used in the late 1820s as an anchorage for visiting American whaling ships. In 1831 Archibald Mosman and John Bell were allotted grants of land in Mosman Bay to establish a whaling station. The only remaining building of the original whaling station is The Barn in Avenue Road. The Barn was a store and sail drying house. It is now the home of the 1st Mosman 1908 Scout Group. Mosman War Memorial, designed by Peter Kaad, and Allan Border Oval A foot track ran from North Sydney to Middle Head in the 1840s. Avenue Road which ran from Mosman Bay to Mosman Junction was constructed in 1860 with Military Road, Middle Head Road, and Bradleys Head Road all constructed ten years later. From the 1870s, land development spread settlement east from Milson's Point, including to the Mosman area, which was boosted with a regular ferry service around the same time. Richard Harnett Senior purchased Archibald Mosman's original in 1859 and in 1878 established a sandstone quarry at Mosman Bay. In 1871, he built a wharf and subsidised a ferry service between Mosman Bay, Neutral Bay, and Circular Quay. He promoted a land development known as the Mosman Bay Estate; when the land was sold, the ferry service was cancelled, much to the annoyance of the new landowners. . His son, Richard Harnett Junior, was the first Mayor elected when Mosman became a municipality in 1893 with 1,600 residents, breaking away from the North Sydney municipality. Both men were major influences in Mosman and were responsible for building many roads, a horse-drawn bus service and ferry services linking Mosman to the city. Mosman Public School opened in 1880. Around the start of the 20th century, rows of shops and Federation architecture homes were built. Taronga Zoo opened in 1916, moving from a site at Moore Park that had been in use since 1884. Taronga is an Aboriginal word for 'beautiful view'. From the late 1950s, multi-storey flat developments began and became a public concern, leading to controls and restrictions being introduced. Spit Bridge, Mosman. Landmarks Balmoral Beach Mosman forms a peninsula between Sydney Harbour and Middle Harbour. It features a number of harbour beaches, including Balmoral, Chinamans, Obelisk and Cobblers Beaches. Other attractions include Taronga Zoo, Bradleys Head and sections of Sydney Harbour National Park.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.123-128 Overlooking the harbour, in Rawson Park, is the Scotland Australia Cairn comprising a stone sourced from every parish in Scotland. It is a memorial to the Scottish pioneers who contributed much to Australia and was a gift from Scotland at the time of the Bicentennial Celebrations in 1988. Highland games are held there, usually the day after St Andrew's Day celebrations. On the eastern shore of Sirius Cove is the site of Curlew Camp where artists such as Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts once resided. The Council has recently constructed the Curlew Camp Artists Walk. Ashton Park is a popular attraction and includes Athol Hall which provides a venue for events and has a caf√© which is open seven days a week.

Mosman's shopping centre is located along Military Road, which features many boutiques, cafes and restaurants. The shopping centre extends from the intersection with Bradley's Head Road and Middle Head Road and continues north up past the intersection with Spit Road at Spit Junction. It continues for some distance along both Spit Road and Military Road and extends down some of the side streets. Mosman Council has identified the early 20th century shopping strip along Military Road as a conservation area. The awnings along the street were originally column-supported. A small shopping mall called Bridgepoint is located at Spit Junction. The Military Road Conservation Area also includes the row of shops at 581-595 Military Road, on the southern side of Military Road between the Town Hall and the Library Walk shopping complex.

He spent forty years studying tribal cultures in Northeast India, in the central region of what is now the state of Telangana and in Nepal. Biography Christoph von F√ºrer-Haimendorf was born in an Austrian aristocratic family. Very early he developed an interest in Indian culture, having read Rabindranath Tagore as a young man. He studied anthropology and archaeology in Vienna and there he was most influenced by Robert von Heine-Geldern. He wrote his thesis on the tribal social organization of the peoples of Assam and NW Burma (Staat und Gesellschaft bei den V√∂lkern Assams und des nordwestlichen Birmas) and in later years was inspired by John Henry Hutton, a fellow researcher of the tribal communities in that region. After his thesis, von F√ºrer-Haimendorf moved to London in order to establish contact with the main anthropologists of his time, such as Bronislaw Malinowski. By 1936 he traveled to India, where he worked among the Naga people and established good friendships among the local administrators of the British Raj. After five months and great effort, he succeeded in learning the local language and was able to do without an interpreter. From then onwards, von F√ºrer-Haimendorf would insist that it was of the utmost importance for an ethnologist or ethnographer to learn well the language of the people who were the subject of the fieldwork in order to be competent in his or her studies. In 1938, von F√ºrer-Haimendorf married Betty Barnado, a colleague. At the time he only made a brief visit to Europe and returned to India, so that at the outbreak of World War II he found himself in British territory holding a Third Reich passport. He was arrested by the colonial authorities, but with a great degree of politeness and sadness, for they were good friends of his. Thus he was confined to Hyderabad State in South India. As time went by von F√ºrer-Haimendorf earned the trust of the local authorities, who could see that he had no Nazi sympathies. He was then able to do some of his best fieldwork ever while living among the Chenchu, Bhil, Reddi and the Raj Gond Adivasi of present-day interior Telangana. Thanks to friendly government officers, which included fellow ethnologist Verrier Elwin, von F√ºrer-Haimendorf was able to obtain a post as Special Officer and Assistant Political Officer to the North East Frontier Agency, so he could move back to Northeast India. He studied the Apatanis in 1944‚Äì45, when there were tensions in the area owing to the Japanese conquest of Burma. When the war was over von F√ºrer-Haimendorf was named Advisor for Tribes and Backward Classes to the Nizam's Government of Hyderabad and returned to the South where he continued to do ethnographic fieldwork while he was engaged as government officer. In 1953, when the Kingdom of Nepal opened to the outside world, von F√ºrer-Haimendorf did not want to lose the opportunity to visit the then little-known country and became the first foreigner who was able to do research among the peoples of Nepal. Christoph von F√ºrer-Haimendorf lived his old age in London, where he became professor of anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies. In 1987, following the death of his wife, his health suffered a decline from which he did not recover. He died on 11 June 1995 and was buried in London.

(Archived by the Wayback Machine: Introduction, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) It is thought that Boneseed had become naturalised in Australia, with self-sustaining populations, from around 1910. Bitou Bush arrived slightly later in around 1908, most likely in the ballast of a South African ship docked off New South Wales. Thereafter both subspecies were planted extensively to stabilise coastal sand dunes and control erosion, particularly from the mid-1940s to the 1960s, with Boneseed more commonly planted in Victoria and Bitou Bush more commonly planted in NSW and Southern Queensland. Boneseed was introduced to the You Yangs, south west of Melbourne, Victoria, to control soil erosion. By the late-1960s both species of C. monilifera had come to be recognised as significant weeds. Boneseed was proclaimed a noxious weed in Victoria in 1969. Not long thereafter, the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science (AIAS) suggested that Boneseed could potentially be \\"the most important weed on public land in southern Victoria\\" due to its ability to colonise areas of bushland without the level of significant disturbance often required by other weedy species. In fact, the AIAS estimated that by 1976 Boneseed had colonised around 405 hectares in the You Yangs, with an even larger area affected on the Mornington Peninsula. Since then the population's expansion has been dramatic, and in the You Yangs, by 2003 it was estimated that Boneseed had extended its presence to around 1300 hectares of the 2000-hectare park. (Archived by the Wayback Machine) It was listed on the Weeds of National Significance in 2000 and is one of the 20 most significant weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and environmental and economic impacts. (Archived by WebCite) C. monilifera has a particularly wide potential range. It is predicted that over time C. monilifera could significantly expand its current distribution to almost all of South Eastern Australia apart from the Alps. Impact C. monilifera has been particularly successful in invading natural bushland. In part, this is due to the species' ability to establish on relatively nutrient- poor soils and in areas exposed to salt such as coastlines, as well as the ability of the seeds to germinate readily. Disturbances such as fire can assist C. monilifera to spread as the plant produces a large amount of seed that can persist in the soil seed bank for 10 years or more, and this reserve in turn enables the species to quickly recolonize a burnt area.

Early life Price was born into a Quaker family in Wallingford, Pennsylvania where his father, James Martin Price, was a moderately successful nurseryman. James had previously taught at the Quaker Westtown School and later became an insurance salesman for the Provident Life and Trust Company. Career Price designed \\"Kelty\\" (1897) for himself and his family. Later owned by author Chaim Potok At age 17, Price began work in the offices of architect Addison Hutton. He subsequently joined his brother Frank in the offices of architect Frank Furness. The brothers opened their own office in 1881. Their first major commission came in 1888, to design suburban houses in Wayne, Pennsylvania for real estate developers Wendell & Smith. The brothers' partnership lasted until 1893. Price designed suburban houses for another Wendell & Smith development, \\"Overbrook Farms,\\" including his own house, \\"Kelty\\" (1894). In 1903, he formed a partnership with M. Hawley McClanahan, that lasted until his death. Price was a Quaker, and his early commissions may have come through religious ties. The owners of Philadelphia's Strawbridge & Clothier Department Store were investors with George W. Vanderbilt in a proposed resort hotel in Ashville, North Carolina, and may have recommended Price to design the Kenilworth Inn (1890‚Äì91, burned 1909). Price's familiarity with Vanderbilt's then-under- construction chateau and estate, \\"Biltmore,\\" seems to have gotten him his next major commission, \\"Woodmont.\\" \\"Woodmont,\\" Alan Wood, Jr. mansion, Gladwyne, PA (1892-94). For steel magnate and former U.S. Congressman Alan Wood, Jr., Price designed \\"Woodmont\\" (1892‚Äì94), a chateauesque mansion built on the highest point in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a bluff overlooking the Schuylkill River, the industrial town of Conshohocken, and the Alan Wood Iron & Steel Company Plant. Price would design other palatial residences, but never again on this scale. Price experimented with new materials, especially reinforced concrete, that were cheaper for constructing hotels and industrial buildings, and allowed wide spans and soaring spaces. At Rose Valley, a utopian community he co-founded, he built new buildings and altered existing ones, creating an Arts & Crafts village. Price's most famous building was the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel (1905‚Äì06), on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Following the 1976 legalization of gambling in the city, architect Robert Venturi hoped to make the building the centerpiece of a casino-hotel, but its reinforced concrete had deteriorated so much that it could not be saved. It was demolished in 1979. Georgism \\"Rest Cottage\\" (1910), a Price- designed house in Arden, DE Will was an ardent Georgist and a believer in the economic philosophy of Henry George. The Arden, Delaware website (www.theardens.com) writes that \\"Arden was founded in 1900 by sculptor Frank Stephens and architect Will Price based on the Single Tax philosophy of Henry George, a political economist whose ideas were popular in America in the late 1800s. The land was and still is owned in common.\\"Arden Craft Shop Museum, Delaware at www.theardens.com Additionally, the Historic Society of Delaware notes: \\"Stephens and Price first came to Delaware in 1895-1896 during the single-tax campaign to win political control of the state. The Single-Taxers hoped that by gaining control of a small political entity they could put their principles into action and show that they could really work. The exhibit will show a rare copy of Justice, a single-tax newspaper published in Wilmington in April 1896. The campaign failed‚Äîmany of the activists were jailed‚Äîbut Price and Stephens did not give up their dream. In 1900, they purchased the Derrickson farm in northern New Castle County. Price designed a town plan that preserved communal open space and encouraged people to mingle with their neighbors. Stephens and Price adopted \\"You are welcome hither\\" as the community motto because they wanted Arden to be a place open to people of all economic levels and political views, a new departure in an era when restrictions were the norm. Price never lived in Arden, but built and owned a handful of cottages;‚Äîhe was more deeply involved in Rose Valley, another idealistic community nearby in Pennsylvania‚Äîbut Frank Stephens did. (Stephens's) enthusiasm, leadership, and ideas guided Arden from a dream to reality. His son Donald also played a vital role in the community.\\"Arden, DE at www.hsd.org Rose Valley \\"Bishop White House,\\" Rose Valley, PA (altered 1902). Price added the 2-story porch and tile roof. The Rose Valley Museum and Historical Society writes the following about Will Price: \\"Will Price died in 1916 at 55. It has been argued that, had he had as long a career as his contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959), Price might also have been a giant among the world‚Äôs architects. There is certainly much about his later work like the Atlantic City hotels and the Chicago Freight Terminal to indicate a radically modern direction. And modernism exists in his earlier work, but it is now more difficult to see or understand. The houses he built before founding Rose Valley are made from the same hodge-podge of materials as any other turn-of-the-century American architect used for the show places of rich clients: cut and rough stone, cedar and slate shingles, Gothic and half- timber wood work, red brick and buff stucco. All of this historicism hid modern systems like electricity, steam heat, and interior plumbing.\\" When Will Price came to Rose Valley there were twelve small houses, two old mills, and a historic stone house once occupied by Bishop White . Price rehabilitated some buildings; slip covered others and, eventually, put up completely new houses. The old bobbin mill was given a quaint rustic porch. A farmhouse above the Bishop White house was encased in stucco and tile and expanded to become the grandest house in the valley, ‚ÄúSch√∂nhaus.‚Äù =House of the Democrat= \\"House of the Democrat,\\" Rose Valley, PA (1911-12). An unpretentious cottage went up on Price‚Äôs Lane, House of the Democrat, which became one of the most influential buildings of the American Arts and Crafts movement. Before it was built, Price published designs for this house in several influential magazines with a national circulation like Ladies‚Äô Home Journal. Along with other Arts and Crafts proselytizers like Gustav Stickley, Price sought to convince Americans that they didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúkeep up with the Joneses.‚Äù He admonished both rich and poor to ‚Äú‚Ä¶dispense with the plush albums and tea-store chromos and self-playing melodeons and comic operas and the daily installment of wood- pulp which calls itself the modern newspaper. Resigning these luxuries, they will get what in return? They will still have the necessaries of life and some of the comforts.‚Äù In 1903 Price wrote a book called Home Building and Furnishing. Being a Combined New Edition of Model Houses for Little Money published together with Inside of 100 Homes by W. M. Johnson in which they made an effort to distill his idea about how anyone‚Äôs home could have everything it needed to live the art that is life without costly materials and elaborate detail. The mere consideration of the quality of housing for the average person was a modern notion. Earlier architects may have designed small houses, but they were for the relatively rich. If and when housing was contemplated for anyone else, it was usually in terms of cheap, exploitative development. =Thunderbird Lodge= Thunderbird Lodge\\" (1904). \\"Thunderbird Lodge,\\" is the studio house of Charles and Alice Barber Stephens designed by Price. His idea of a modern home is one that fits the life its owners lived. He was very much against copying historical styles because not everyone lived like Roman emperors or French royalty. He thought beauty would come not from the architect‚Äôs design but from the fitness of purpose, place, and materials. The most eloquent example of this ideal is found in Rose Valley's Thunderbird Lodge. The structure grew from an existing stone bank barn. The second floor of the barn became a studio for Charles while the first was shaped into another for Alice. The name of the house derived from Charles Stephens‚Äôs passionate interest in Native American artifacts. His collection eventually became the core of the University of Pennsylvania museum collection. The fireplace in the upstairs studio is said to have the form of a Thunderbird, a symbol that also appears on the studio exterior, this time made of Henry Mercer‚Äôs Moravian tiles. Price described the house: ‚ÄúThe old barn standing near the road was converted into first and second floor studios, the old timber roof being rebuilt for the upper studio, and large windows and fireplaces being built into the old walls. The house rambles off from the fireplace and off the studios and is connected to them by an octagonal stair hall. It is built in part of fieldstone so like that in the old barn that it is almost impossible to tell old work from new. The upper part is of warm gray plaster, and the roof of red tile. All of the detail is as simple and direct as possible, and the interior is finished in cypress stained to soft browns and grays and guilty of no finish other than wax or oil.‚Äù Citing the way the house fit its site, the way the pergola helped integrate the building and gardens, the use of local materials, and the references to indigenous architecture, magazines compared it to the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright who was then just beginning to develop his signature Prairie School style. Thunderbird lodge later became the home of the Olmsteds: Judge Allen and Mildred Scott Olmsted, both well-known social activists. He was instrumental in the founding of the American Civil Liberties Union, and she was a tireless proponent of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.\\" From the websiteArchitecture and The Crafts at The Rose Valley Museum & Historical Society Architecture at www.rosevalleymuseum.org Photographs of Will's buildings are available at this website. Under the terms of Mildred Scott Olmsted's will, Thunderbird Lodge was donated to the Rose Valley Centennial Foundation in 2015 to preserve the property in perpetuity.

On November 4, 2010, Six Flags had an investor meeting webcast where they released the new name for the kid's coaster and location in Bugs Bunny World. By April 2011, the entire coaster has finished construction on site. The ride opened on May 28, 2011, for Memorial Day Weekend. History =Six Flags New Orleans (2000‚Äî2010)= Road Runner Express originally opened at Jazzland in New Orleans on May 20, 2000. It operated under the name Rex's Rail Runner in the Kid's Carnival section of the park. Six Flags took over the lease of Jazzland in 2002 and changed the park's name to Six Flags New Orleans the following year. The ride was renamed to Road Runner Express in the \\"Looney Tunes Adventures\\" section of the park. When Hurricane Katrina hit the park on August 29, 2005, severe flooding caused the park and its rides to shut down. In 2007, Six Flags began the process of moving rides from the park to their other properties. For example, Batman: The Ride was taken to Six Flags Fiesta Texas where it was refurbished and renamed Goliath in 2008. In 2008, Bayou Blaster and Sonic Slam were removed and taken to Great Escape where it was refurbished and renamed Sasquatch in 2009. In 2009, Road Runner Express was removed and relocated to Six Flags Magic Mountain. =Six Flags Magic Mountain (2010‚Äîpresent)= Road Runner Express was dismantled and moved in 2009 to its current location at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The ride was due to open for their 2010 season under the name Mr. Six's Dance Coaster in the Cyclone Bay section of the park, however, the opening was delayed for a year. On August 3, 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported \\"the junior coaster will keep the current red and black color scheme and stay in the same planned location in the northwest corner of the park but will likely receive a new name and theme.\\" On November 4, 2010, Six Flags announced that the ride will not use the originally planned Mr. Six's Dance Coaster name and theme, but will operate from early May 2011 as Little Flash which is, themed to the DC Comics superhero sidekicks in Bugs Bunny World. On January 18, 2011, the LA Times reported after considering a new theme based on DC Comics superhero sidekicks, the park opted for simplicity and would name the coaster Road Runner Express. Two days later, Six Flags Magic Mountain confirmed that the kid's coaster would be called Road Runner Express and that it would open on March 19, along with the revamped Superman: Escape from Krypton. However, the construction of the ride was delayed forcing the opening day to be bumped back. On April 25, 2011, the construction of Road Runner Express was complete and is expected to open for Memorial Day Weekend. The coaster officially opened on May 28, 2011. This resulted with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote theme, rockets on the roller blade-style train, and Arizona desert background. Ride Track layout Guests board a train which seat 16 riders. The train is taken up using a drive tire system to a height of . of twists, turns and elevation changes follow, before the ride comes to a halt in the brake run. Riders will reach a top speed of on the one-minute ride. The background blends in with the ride's Road Runner theming.

The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s. Due to its rapid spread and ecological impact it has classified as one of the most damaging invasive species in Australia. Although they are legal to hunt, they may be domesticated in New South Wales. Introduction and spread Red Foxes were introduced to the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District and Sydney Regions of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. Curiously a permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia, another invasive species also introduced in the 19th century that is a key prey of the red fox. Current distribution An exotic fox in Mornington Peninsula National Park with Mange. Established populations of red fox are found in all states and are widespread throughout the country with the exception of tropical areas of northern Queensland, the Kimberley and the Top End of the Northern Territory. From 2010, confirmed evidence of foxes in Tasmania has been reported by the state's Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment. Foxes are found in ever higher concentrations in densely populated suburban areas and in large cities such as Melbourne. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent; however, it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. Ecological damage The West Australian conservation department, CALM, estimates introduced predators are responsible for the extinction of ten native species in that state. The species has been directly implicated in the extinction and decline of populations of the family Potoroidae including the extinction of the Desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of the red fox population corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbies, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabies and quokkas. Most of these species now only live in limited areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. In 2016 researchers documented that some red foxes in Australia had learned to climb trees to look for baby koalas and other unsuspecting creatures such as gliders, dispelling the long-held belief that tree-dwelling creatures were safe from them. Management and control Dead foxes displayed along a fence at alt=fox fence of Balliang, Victoria Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. (Refers to the book Australia's Mammal Extinctions: a 50,000 year history. Christopher N. Johnson. . The main form of control is baits, typically containing 1080 poison. Fox hunting is legal in all states and they are typically shot with the aid of spotlighting at night or attracted using fox whistles during the day. The eyeshine signature (from the tapetum lucidum in the eye) of foxes, and body shape and silhouette are used to identify them. The reintroduction of competitive species has also been suggested as a method of control. Research by the CSIRO concluded that the presence of dingos not only decrease the presence of foxes, but increase native fauna. (Refers to the book Australia's Mammal Extinctions: a 50,000 year history. Christopher N. Johnson. . Professor Chris Johnson of James Cook University and Dr Euan Ritchie of Deakin University have advocated the reintroduction of Tasmanian Devils to the mainland to perform a similar role as evidenced by past eradication of foxes from Tasmania as well as to ensure the ongoing survival of that native species. =Western Shield Program= Western Australian state government authorities conduct aerial and hand baiting on almost to control foxes (and feral cats) as part of the Western Shield pest management program. =Fox Free Tasmania program= According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established. An independent member of the Tasmanian state Parliament, Ivan Dean, has claimed that the fox introductions are a hoax, a claim the Minister for Primary Industry, David Llewellyn described as a \\"load of rubbish\\". Tasmania is estimated to have the carrying capacity to support a population of up to foxes.

It is surrounded three sides by the largest fresh water lake of Kerala, Sasthamkotta lake. The temple here is well known for the inhabitance of monkeys. The temple monkeys are believed to be the divine retinue of the prime deity. The Sasthamcotta temple is one among the five ancient Sastha temples in Kerala - AchanKoil, Aryankavu, Kulathupuzha, Sasthamcotta and Sabarimala. The concept of Dharma Sastha represents the unison of Vaishnava and Saiva beliefs. The presiding deity of the temple is Shri Dharma Sastha, accompanied by his consort ‚ÄòPrabha‚Äô and son ‚ÄòSathyaka‚Äô. Legend The legend of this temple stretches beyond the period of the Ramayana (Treta Yuga). It is believed that Shri Rama along with his wife Sita, brother Lakshmana and the whole vaanara sena, on their way back to Ayodhya after the victory over Ravana, visited Sasthamcotta to pay their reverence to Shri Dharma Sastha. Shri Rama offered pithru tharpan on the banks of the Sasthamcotta Lake, the water of which is supposed to be identical to Surya Raga Theertha of Manasa Sarovar. Lord Rama then deputed the chief architect of his vanara (monkey) team, Neelan to serve his host. Neelan is believed to be the predecessor of the prevailing monkey clan in this temple. Festivals =Utsavam (annual festival)= The utsavam lasts for ten days. The flag is hoisted on the first day heralding the utsavam. The utsavam culminates with the ‚Äòaraattu‚Äô on ‚ÄòUtram‚Äô in the month of Kumbham (February‚ÄìMarch). The tenth day hosts the ‚ÄòKettukazhcha‚Äô-- a procession of various effigies of bullocks, horses, decorated chariots, etc. -- A number of elephants with their nettipattam (decorative head-dress) also come to the temple to pay reverence to the prime deity, who sits atop a caparisoned elephant at the temple courtyard, escorted with many other decorated elephants. =Religious Festivals= * Thiruvonam * Navaratri * Mandala Mahotsav (41 days) * Makara Sankrama pooja * Sivaratri * Painkuni Utram * Pathamudayam * Karkidaka Vavu References * Kottarathil Shankunni (1909). \\"Itheehyamala\\", Sasthamcottayum Kuranganmarum.

Furthermore, the anonymity provided by the forum atmosphere encourages voicing out political opinions and critiques that are not usually expressed in the public arena due to fear of persecution. Censorship and access disruptions The first censorship action was carried out by UAE authorities in November 2009. The action specifically targeted an article entitled ‚ÄúBeyond the Biography of Allah‚Äù which offered an atheistic critique of monotheistic divinity, a taboo topic in the religiously conservative UAE society. However, since February 7, 2010, access to the website has been completely disrupted in the UAE; visitors receive a network error message. The US company that hosts the site, Host Rocket, confirmed that the inaccessibility in the UAE is not due to any technical problem.http://en.rsf.org/united-arab-emirates-access-to-independent- online-24-02-2010,36525.html The unconventional method of blocking by the TRA has been interpreted by many as a plan to identify the owners of the website.http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=156 On 14 March 2010, the Emirati lawyer and human rights activist Abdul Hamid Alkamiti filed a complaint to the prosecutor general in Dubai against the Telecomm Regulatory Authority demanding the disclosure of reasons behind the censorship action.http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=156 As of May 2017, the website account had been suspended and not accessible to anyone in any part of the world.

Interior of the church. Exterior of the basilica The Basilica di San Gavino (Basilica of Saint Gabinus) is a proto- Romanesque church in Porto Torres, Sardinia, Italy. A former cathedral, it is now a place for the veneration of local martyrs and a parish church. History Turris Libisonis (Latin:Turris Libyssonis, present day:Porto Torres) was a bishopric seat from 489 until 1441, when the see was moved to nearby Sassari. The basilica is located in the Monte Angellu section of Porto Torres; an area where archaeological excavations have found a Paleo-Christian necropolis and two ancient basilicas, dating to the 5th ‚Äì 7th centuries AD; one of which was built over the tomb of Saint Gabinus whose remains are interred in the present church. Coat of arms of the Giudicato of Torres, in the church exterior. The earliest known document mentioning the church dates to 1065. According to it, the church was founded in the early 11th century by Gonario I, giudice (duke) of Torres and Arborea, who commissioned the work to Pisan masters. The construction continued under his son Barisone I, and was inaugurated by the giudice Marianus I of Arborea and archbishop Constantine of Castra in 1080. An epigraph in the Romanesque portal testifies restoration work in the 15th century, which introduced Catalan-Gothic elements. In the 18th century the crypt was renovated to house the remains of Torres' martyrs found in 1614. Description =Exterior= The church is located between two courtyards, known as atrio Comita and atrio Metropoli. In the southern side is the main entrance, a 15th-century portal in Catalan Gothic style. It is surmounted by a rounded arch supported by two columns, whose capitals have angels with coats of arms. The church has two apses, one on each shorter side of the rectangular plan. The exterior is decorated by blind columns and Lombard bands. The ceiling is covered with lead plates. =Interior= The interior has a nave and two aisles separated by two series of rounded arches which are supported by twenty-two columns, taken from ancient edifices, in gray marble and pink granite, and three pairs of cruciform pilasters. Most of the capitals are of Roman origin. The nave is some three time wider than the aisles, and is covered by wooden trusses; the aisles have instead cross vaults. Roman sarcophagi housing the alleged remains of St. Gabinus and St. Ianuarius. The high altar, which until the 19th century was in the middle of the nave, is now in the south-western apse; the opposing apse has a wooden catafalque of the 17th century, housing polychrome statues of the martyrs Gabinus, Protus and Ianuarius. The aisles led to the anti-crypt, in Renaissance style with statues of martyrs, and the crypt, which houses ancient Roman sarcophagi; the latter in turn house remains attributed to the Turres' martyrs.

Both High Courts function both as a civil and criminal court of first instance and a civil and criminal appellate court for cases from the subordinate courts. The Vestre Landsret sits in Viborg but has chambers in larger western cities, used only for criminal cases. It has jurisdiction over all County Courts in Jutland. A County Court decision can always be appealed to a High Court - if the disputed claim exceeds DKK 10.000. First instance civil cases may only be brought before the High Court if the disputed claim exceeds DKK 1.000.000. The Vestre Landsret has one President and 38 judges. Like the √òstre Landsret, it is split into chambers, each consisting of three High Court judges. Though the President of the High Court appoints a presiding judge for each chamber, all decisions are reached by a simple majority, in all types of cases. Vestre High Court was established in 1919, replacing the Landsoverretten for N√∏rrejylland (Country superior court for Northern Jutland). The court's main building in Viborg was built and commissioned in January 1920. It is located on St√¶nderpladsen in Viborg and was designed by architect Christopher Varming. In front of the main entrance to the Vestre High Court stands a bust of lawyer Anders Sand√∏e √òrsted. In the middle of St√¶nderpladsen is a statue by sculptor Anker Hoffmann. At St√¶nderpladsen is another monument associated with Vestre High Court, namely the memorial stone for Royal Law, arranged in connection with 700 anniversary of the introduction of the Law of Jutland in 1241. Over time it became necessary to add premises elsewhere, in line with increased activity. In criminal cases by jury or Lay Assessors the court also uses courtrooms in Aalborg, Aarhus, Kolding, Esbjerg and S√∏nderborg. Construction of a new courthouse in Viborg was decided by the Danish Parliament in 2010; it was inaugurated in 2014.

It was taught to him at school by his teacher called Tortoise.  Context  The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon and Alice \\"The Lobster Quadrille\\" is a song written by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll). It is a parody of \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" by Mary Botham Howitt. It appeared in Chapter 10 of Carroll's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and was sung by a character in the book, the Mock Turtle. The poem is very similar to \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" in its rhyme scheme, meter, and tone. The first lines of the two songs are as follows: Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail... (The Lobster Quadrille) Will you walk into my parlour said a spider to a fly... (The Spider and the Fly) The song fits into the flow of chapters 9 and 10, \\"The Mock Turtle's Story\\" and \\"The Lobster Quadrille\\", which are about the Mock Turtle's life and schooling under the sea. The whimsical lyrics feature animals such as porpoises, snails and lobsters. The snail is invited to join a dance in which he would be cast into the English channel towards France, but he fearfully declines. The reason is left unspoken in the song, but France is known for its consumption of escargot.  Lyrics   Settings  The song was done by Franz Ferdinand (band) for the 2010 film Alice in Wonderland. The song was featured in the film's soundtrack. The song was done by the band The Four Postmen on their 1997 album Looking for Grandpa in an upbeat modern style. The song was done by the punk rock band Feederz on their 1986 album Teachers in Space. The song was performed by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker (with Becker doing the lead vocals) as part of a number of demo songs recorded before they formed the band Steely Dan. The song was set for chorus by Irving Fine in his \\"Three Choruses from Alice in Wonderland\\" (1942). The poem was set to music by Gy√∂rgy Ligeti in his \\"Nonsense Madrigals\\" (1988/93). The song is sung by a chorus to the \\"real\\" Alice in the 1985 film Dreamchild.

Onstad played football for SFK Lyn in his younger days. He played as defender on the club's first- team, including a feature in the 1928 Norwegian Football Cup final. In 1935, together with his brother Haakon Onstad (1901-1980), he started the shipping company, Niels Onstad Tank Rederi A / S, which later was named Niels Onstads Tankrederi with headquarters in Oslo. Haakon Onstad had entered ship owning in 1932 with the Pan Gothia but because of the uncertain financial times the ship was given Swedish registry under Rederi A/B Pagota. In 1940, during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Niels Onstad moved to New York City where he worked for the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission (Nortraship).

In the face of the car ferry revolution, in 1972, she was converted to a 15-car ferry for the Dunoon to Gourock crossing. Sold to Italian owners in 1978, she operated, as Capri Express in the Bay of Naples until 2006, when she was scrapped. History Maid of Cumbrae was the last of a quartet of passenger vessels ordered in 1951 to modernise the Clyde fleet. She was built by Ardrossan Dockyard Ltd.. As demand switched from short cruises to car ferries, in 1972, she was converted to operate as a 15-car ferry. She operated in this configuration for three years and was then sold in 1978, for a new career in the Adriatic. Layout MV Maid of Cumbrae had a forward observation lounge and an aft tearoom, both with large windows. Open deck space available for passengers was limited. The bridge was forward on the promenade deck, with a landing platform above, for use at very low tides. She had two masts and a single funnel, above the central engines, with the galley aft. To operate as a car ferry, the superstructure aft of her funnel was removed and two side-ramps, a stern ramp and a deck-turntable were fitted. Her passenger facilities were re-arranged. These modifications reduced her passenger certificate (Class V) to 310. By the time she operated in the Bay of Naples, she had an inflatable swimming pool on the vehicle deck and a forward passenger lounge. Service MV Maid of Cumbrae initially gave short cruises, including from Glasgow. On Saturdays she generally assisted on the hard- pressed Gourock - Dunoon service. In the late 1950s, the Maids lost their fixed routes and all operated across the Clyde network. They became progressively redundant as the car ferry revolution swept all before it. Maid of Cumbrae was withdrawn at the end of the 1971 season and laid-up in Glasgow's Princes Dock. Plans to move to Dunoon were thwarted and she was required to stay on the Islay service. To provide much needed vehicle capacity, in early 1972, Maid of Cumbrae was rapidly converted to a vehicle ferry and gave three years of reliable service, supporting at Dunoon, until the arrival of the in December 1974. She then became a spare vessel, relieving and taking charters until 20 May 1978, when she was laid up in the James Watt Dock, Greenock. On 25 August 1978, complete with a spare propeller and shaft, she left the Clyde for the Adriatic. In 1979, as Noce di Cocco (\\"Coconut\\"), she entered service between Trieste and Muggia, operated by Navigazione Alto Adriatico, but still in Caledonian MacBrayne livery. She spent less than a year on this run, before moving to the Bay of Naples, as Capri Express. At first she cruised between Capri and Positano, later as a car ferry between Naples and Sorrento and from 2000, between Pozzuoli and Procida, in the company of her old sister Ala (ex ). Withdrawn in 2006, she was towed to Aliaƒüa for scrapping and beached in March.

Each class studies the following subjects, designed from the British and International Curriculum: Art, Information & Communication Technology (ICT), Literacy (reading, writing, grammar, spelling), Mathematics, Music, Personal, Social & Health Education (PSHE), Physical Education (PE), Religious Education (RE), Science and World Around Us (Geography, History, Cultural Studies). KISC Primary seeks to engage student through creative and active learning while affirming all learning styles. We aim to not only develop academically, but value the emotional, physical and spiritual growth of each student.  Secondary Curriculum  11-14 yrs Students from 11 to 14 years of age are grouped into 3 age level classes of approximately 15 to 20 students and study Art and Design, English, Geography, History, ICT, Mathematics, Music, Nepali Language and Culture, Personal and Social Education, Physical Education, Religious Education, Science and usually one foreign language from a choice of French, German and Spanish. In these subjects, a common curriculum is used, with text materials from the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and other English speaking countries making it as international in content as possible. All courses stress the basic subject skills required in most countries. Specific work on many of the home countries from which our students come is covered in Personal, Health and Social Education (PSHE), as is keeping abreast of what's going on in the world around them. Sports and other Elective courses are also offered with the selection varying from term to term. The medium of instruction at KISC is English. However, if teachers are available, students whose native language is not English may have the opportunity to do some studies in their own language. Students whose English is particularly weak may be given individual or small-group Study Support lessons to help them develop their English skills as quickly as possible. 14-16 yrs Students from 14‚Äì18 years are studying along an international education path made up of 2 facets. The first is the American High School Diploma. The second is the International Certificate in Education (ICE) which students work towards in the first 2 years and the AICE Diploma in the second 2 years. The ICE is achieved by studying a selection of subjects most of which students will sit IGCSE exams in at the end of year 11. Students usually study 8 IGCSE subjects at KISC in Year 10-11 as well as 5 other compulsory non-IGCSE subjects for which they receive credits towards the American High School Diploma. The International General Certificate of Secondary Education is a two-year course culminating in external assessment by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate in the UK. A student may study individual IGCSE subjects or work towards the International Certificate in Education (ICE). The ICE is earned by achieving satisfactory grades in seven IGCSE subjects, which must include at least one subject from each of five groups of subjects, including a language other than English. Most IGCSE students study eight subjects, five of which are compulsory and three of which are options. All students also attend compulsory non-IGCSE classes in Physical Education, Religious Education, ICT, PSE and Electives. All subjects studied count towards credits required for the USA. Below are the IGCSE Subject options in their appropriate groupings. Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Group 5 *English Language *English Literature *Co- ord. Science (2) *Mathematics Business Studies French Geography Art & Design German History Music Spanish Subjects marked * are compulsory. Co-ordinated Science, covering Physics, Chemistry and Biology, counts as two subjects at IGCSE. Future Options Students must study most subjects at IGCSE Level and pass with a Grade C or above in order to take that subject at AS (Advanced Subsidiary Level) in Year 12-13. Students wishing to go to College in the US must take American History and Government (1 credit course) at some point in Year 10-13. Students wishing to take AS English must pass IGCSE English Language and English Literature. Note Courses for Year 10-11 are two-year courses and it is very difficult for students to catch up on their work if they are absent. KISC therefore recommends that students should not be absent for extended periods of time and that furloughs/Home Leave are avoided where possible or else taken during school holidays. 16-18 yrs During Term 3 at KISC all Year 11 students who would like to study in Year 12 and 13 are asked to make choices regarding the courses they wish to follow. AICE Diploma (Equivalent to 3 British A levels or 6 British AS Levels) The Advanced International Certificate of Secondary Education Diploma is a two-year pre- university course. It progresses from IGCSE and culminates in external assessment by the University of Cambridge International Examinations center in the UK. A student may study individual AS (Advance Subsidiary) subjects or work towards the Advanced International Certificate in Education (AICE) Diploma. The AICE Diploma is earned by achieving satisfactory grades in six AS subjects, which must include at least one subject from each of the three groups of subjects Below are the AS Subject options in their appropriate groupings. Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Biology English Art and Design Chemistry Foreign Language - French Business Studies Computing Foreign Language - German Geography Mathematics History Physics NB: Geography and Business Studies do not need to be studied at IGCSE level to do the AS level. A Levels are offered in some subjects according to student requirements. Additional Curriculum All students also have classes in Information and Communication Technology, Physical Education, Religious Education, Personal and Social Education and Electives.

Location Guardamar Cal√≠ope (G-40) near the CCS in Almer√≠a, owned by the Sociedad de Salvamento y Seguridad Mar√≠tima. The port is located in the center of the city, and serves primarily as a ferry terminal. Crossings to destinations in North Africa take approximately 6 hours (normal ferry to Nador or Melilla). This is a much longer (and more expensive) crossing than the short crossings from Algeciras to Tangier, but it is more convenient for people traveling to the Rif area or Algeria. Almeria offers also a marina and a normal commercial port: it can receive cargo ships and cruise ships. The Royal Navy uses the port. Ferry terminal The ferry terminal is busy. Moroccan nationals living in Western Europe use the crossings from Almeria to visit relatives in the summer. The port offers several sailings each day to different destinations in northern Morocco and Algeria. The port has a large waiting and sorting area for cars. As people have oftem traveled a very long distance, they tend to arrive hours before departure of the ship. To prevent overheating, most waiting areas for the cars are under a roof to protect the car and its passengers from the sun. The main terminal building has the offices of all the operating companies where they sell the tickets or exchange your prepaid tickets for a boarding pass. The terminal building is open 24 hours a day and includes a cafe and a small shop/kiosk for refreshments and a call-shop. Foot passengers can wait inside the terminal building for their ship. Embarkation for foot passengers is situated on the first floor of the terminal building. After the Spanish immigration checks, a network of footbridges lead to the ship. These footbridges can reach each quay and via moving 'last metres', so that one can board the ships without having to touch the ground. The loading and unloading of cars does not interfere with the embarkation or disembarkation of foot passengers. Outside the main terminal building there are a few restaurants, offering passengers a simple menu or drinks. There is also a small supermarket that is open 24 hours and facilities like toilets and showers. Vessel Traffic Services As Almeria is a busy port where ships tend to constantly arrive and/or sail, all ships have to use a harbour pilot. On arrival, the pilot boards the ship when it arrives at the piers and leaves the ship when the first warp is fastened. On departure, the pilot leaves the ferry just before it passes the pier-head. A complicating factor for arriving ships is that all ferries have to swing round before docking: as the ships moor in Africa with the bow towards the key they have to dock in Almeria with the stern facing the key or cars would have to turn on the ships or disembark driving backwards. At the entrance of the port is a large tower for the officers of the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). The tower provides the staff with a good view over the harbour entrance and the entire port area. The VTS is fitted with radar on top of the tower.

Lateral view. The Episcopal Palace of Astorga (Leonese: Palacio Episcopal d'Estorga) is a building by Spanish Catalan architect Antoni Gaud√≠. It was built between 1889 and 1913. Designed in the Catalan Modernisme style, it is one of only three buildings by Gaud√≠ outside Catalonia. History When the original Episcopal Palace was destroyed by a fire in the 19th century, Bishop Juan Bautista Grau y Vallespinos of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Astorga decided to assign the design of the new building to his friend Antoni Gaud√≠. The two had become friends when Grau was Vicar- General in the Archdiocese of Tarragona and had inaugurated a church for which the architect had designed the high altar. When Gaud√≠ received the commission, he was still working at the Palau G√ºell in Barcelona, and thus he could not move to Astorga to study the terrain and the area of the new construction. He therefore asked the bishop to send him photographs so Gaud√≠ could plan the new project. Gaud√≠ sent back his design, and it was approved in February 1889. The first stone was placed in June the following year. The edifice, built in gray granite from El Bierzo, is in a neo-medieval style harmonizing with its location, including the cathedral in particular. It does, however, also feature some of the elements typical of the later Gaud√≠, such as the arches of the entrance with buttresses, and the chimneys integrated in the side fa√ßades. Gaud√≠ had devised a five-meter tall angel to crown the fa√ßade, but it was never mounted. The fa√ßade has four cylindrical towers and is surrounded by a ditch. In 1893, after the death of Bishop Grau, Gaud√≠ resigned over disagreements with the council, halting the construction for several years. The palace was completed between 1907 and 1915 by Ricardo Garcia Guereta. During the Spanish Civil War, the building served as the local headquarters of the Falange. In 1956 Juli√† Castelltort, a Catalan, began restoration works to adapt the building as a bishop's residence. Later, Bishop Marcelo Gonz√°lez Mart√≠n promoted the conversion to the current role of the palace, a museum of religious art called Museo de los Caminos, dedicated to the Way of Santiago.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. It is considered to be one of the finest Arts and Crafts churches in Wales. History The building of the church started in 1895; it was completed in 1898 and was consecrated on 26 April. The church was designed by Henry Wilson who was a \\"leading figure of the Arts and Crafts Movement\\". It was commissioned by Mrs Louisa Tooth in memory of her second husband Charles Tooth, who had been chaplain and founder of the Anglican St Mark's English Church, Florence and a brother of Arthur Tooth. Since being declared redundant, it has been in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in brick, and faced with local grey-green ashlar stone; it has slate roofs. The \\"external stonework was intended to be left 'untooled' (rough)\\", because the architect \\"wished the church to appear as if it had sprung out of the soil, instead of being planted down on it\\". Its plan consists of a nave with north and south porches, and a chancel with north and south transepts. In the west end are two tiers of ogee-headed windows. Between the windows in the upper tier is a cross in relief. There are similar windows, asymmetrically placed, on the north and south sides of the church. On the roof, in a position to the west of the transepts, is a two-tier bellcote. In its lower tier is a round-headed arch containing the bell, with a smaller round-arched opening above. At the east end is a stepped buttress containing a round-arched lancet window, on each side of which is an ogee-headed window. =Interior= The interior of the church is rendered and painted, with \\"rich warm red\\" nave walls, a blue nave roof and \\"warm cream, almost a yellow\\" colour for the chancel. The nave has three-bay roof; its ceiling is canted and has a plain cornice. The north and south doors are in Art Nouveau style. These are constructed in oak and teak in chevron designs, and have mother-of-pearl decoration at the points of the chevrons. The lead font has a circular bowl carried on an octagonal column. It was cast at the Central School of Art and Design in London, and is decorated with leaf patterns and Christian monograms. The pulpit and retable were designed by Wilson, and are constructed from beaten and moulded copper. They are in Arts and Crafts style, the pulpit being decorated with grapes and texts from the Vulgate. The chancel is groin vaulted. The north transept contains an organ and in the south transept is a gallery. The stalls in the chancel are made from Spanish chestnut; they were designed by Wilson and carved by Arthur Grove with zoomorphic images. These include a hare, a tortoise, squirrels, rabbits, an owl, a mouse, a kingfisher, and a dolphin. The altar rails contain panels between large posts. The altar frontal was designed by Wilson; it is in cast copper and contains figurative panels. These depict, on the left, the Annunciation with the Virgin Mary and a dove facing a kneeling angel and, on the extreme right, the Rev Tooth and his guardian angel. The reredos is also in beaten copper; it depicts a vine springing from a chalice, and at the sides are bluebells springing from the monogram \\"IHS\\". The single-manual organ was built by Peter Conacher of Huddersfield in 1901. =Churchyard= The churchyard contains the Commonwealth war grave of a Royal Flying Corps officer of World War I. CWGC Casualty record. Critique The church is listed Grade I by Cadw because it is \\"a highly important and unaltered example of the work of Henry Wilson, a leading figure of the Arts and Crafts Movement. St Mary's [sic], Brithdir ranks amongst his major works in Britain\\". It is \\"an exceptionally important and advanced work for its date\\". The church is considered to be \\"one of the few full blooded Arts and Crafts churches in Wales\\", and \\"one of the pre- eminent churches of the Arts and Crafts Movement\\". \\"The interior decoration and fittings are arguably the most complete and high-quality Arts and Crafts work in Wales.\\" Gallery ;Inside File:Interior of St Mark's Church, Brithdir, Gwynedd.JPGInterior File:Font in St Mark's Church, Brithdir, Gwynedd.JPGFont File:Left side of the altar of St Mark's Church, Brithdir, Gwynedd.JPGLeft side of altar panel about Charles Tooth, brother of Arthur Tooth File:Altar panel in St Mark's Church, Brithdir, Gwynedd.JPGAltar panel showing its relation to Arthur Tooth ;Outside Eglwys Sant Marc Brithdir ger Dolgellau Gwynedd St Mark's Church, Brithdir Gwynedd Wales 02.JPGChurch front Eglwys Sant Marc Brithdir ger Dolgellau Gwynedd St Mark's Church, Brithdir Gwynedd Wales 07.JPGArts and Crafts style on straps Eglwys Sant Marc Brithdir ger Dolgellau Gwynedd St Mark's Church, Brithdir Gwynedd Wales 100.JPGOld yew tree with new growth Eglwys Sant Marc Brithdir ger Dolgellau Gwynedd St Mark's Church, Brithdir Gwynedd Wales 102.tifBack Eglwys Sant Marc Brithdir ger Dolgellau Gwynedd St Mark's Church, Brithdir Gwynedd Wales 105.JPGBell tower and back of church Eglwys Sant Marc Brithdir ger Dolgellau Gwynedd St Mark's Church, Brithdir Gwynedd Wales 16.JPGPorch References External links * Artwork at St Mark's Church, Brithdir Brithdir, St Mark Brithdir, St Mark Category:Arts and Crafts architecture in Wales Category:Churches completed in 1898 Category:Churches preserved by the Friends of Friendless Churches Category:Brithdir and Llanfachreth Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Wales Category:1898 establishments in Wales Brithdir Brithdir Category:Art Nouveau church buildings in the United Kingdom ","title":"St Mark's Church, Brithdir"},{"id":"28221167","text":"Danny Ernesto T√©llez Murillo (born 16 August 1974) is a retired Nicaraguan footballer.

It is operated today as a museum. It is part of the Colonial Germantown Historic District which was named a National Historic Landmark District in 1965. View from northwest Built in 1775 by Jacob Knorr (or Knor), Concord was the first English-language school in Germantown, which was then a separate town about six miles northwest of Philadelphia. It is built on the corner of the Upper Burial Ground at Washington Lane and Germantown Avenue. It opened to students in October 1775, and served as a school room until at least 1889. Architecture Site plan from the Historic American Buildings Survey The school is , two bays by three bays, and was originally one story with a cellar. In 1818 a second floor was added as a town meeting room which was long used as a library. A square open belfry with a spire tops the roof. The walls are made of rough random rubble which was once stuccoed. Both entrance doors are on the south side of the building. The cellar is accessed from two stairways, one from the outside in front of the school, and the other from the back of the classroom. The teacher stood on a raised platform on the west side of the classroom. The building retains its original bell and belfry, schoolmaster's desk, books, and even a stool and dunce cap. The schoolhouse sits on a raised lot about above and about east of Germantown Avenue. Seven stairs ascend from the street leading to the school which is on the same level as the Upper Burial Ground. A short retaining wall on Germantown Avenue, may have been built in 1777, when the much taller wall around the Upper Burial Ground was built. Knorr, a master builder, is buried in the burial ground. He also constructed the John Johnson House across the street, Cliveden, and the original Germantown Academy. History At a meeting on March 24, 1775, the residents of the upper part of Germantown decided that the Union School was too far for their children to travel, and they needed a schoolhouse of their own. The Union School was perhaps the largest non-religious building in Germantown at the time. German was its main language of instruction. It was later known as the Germantown Academy and is located one mile south of the Concord School House. Other nearby schools were single rooms, including the Harmony School in Chestnut Hill and the Lutheran School, both founded in 1745. See page 33. Instruction in Germantown schools at this period was not based on religion but concentrated more on reading, writing, spelling, and arithmetic. Students generally attended the closest school. Schools were not seen as competitors, for example 14 trustees of the Union School donated to the Concord School, and the two schools shared two building managers. About 17% of the Concord Schools students were Dunkards, who are believed to have enrolled only because so many Dunkards lived in the immediate area. See pp.240-241. The school's record book covers the founding through the early twentieth century and is held by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. It lists 122 original subscribers. Concord Schoolhouse c.1897 Samuel Fitch Hochkin quotes the record of the first meeting extensively. Jacob Engle, Peter Keyser, Peter Leibert, and Jacob Knorr were chosen to be the managers of the building. Knorr \\"nearly completed\\" the building in October 1775. The total money subscribed was 245 pounds, 1 shilling, and 2 pence, but the record notes \\"the Continental that came to nothing 2 pounds. Real amount 243 pounds 1 shilling 2 pence.\\" The site beside the Upper Burial Ground was chosen, construction began, and in October 1775, the Concord School was nearly completed and opened. John Grimes was the first schoolmaster and instruction was entirely in English. Based on an article by William N. Johnson in Germantown Magazine, December 1925. Marker in the Upper Burial Ground, just a few feet north of the school, on the presumed site of the mass grave of 58 American soldiers killed in the Battle of Germantown On October 4, 1777 the Battle of Germantown was fought outside the school, with a key action fought at Cliveden, just a block north. During the period of the Revolutionary War it is not clear whether the school was open, as no records were kept from 1776-1783. The Union School, located further south, was closed during this period. On April 15, 1783 six trustees were appointed including the four original managers Jacob Engle, Peter Keyser, Peter Leibert, and Jacob Knorr, as well as John Johnson, Jr. and Winard Nice. The school was supported by subscription and neighbors contributed to the fund, allowing any family that could afford the fee to enroll its children (around $2 per quarter, plus .25 for spelling books), including families of African descent who rented the school house in the 1850s. When Pennsylvania's public school system was established in 1840, the local township school board rented the building through 1842, marking the end of Concord School's use as an independent school. The building was however, rented out to other schools and social groups after this date. West wall of the school. The datestone at the peak of the gable reads \\"Concord School, 1775.\\" The stone on the second floor reads \\"Charter Oak Library, Nov. 22, 1855.\\" The Hiram Lodge of the Masonic Order rented the upper floor from 1821 to 1823. The Senior Order of United American Mechanics rented the upper floor from 1847 until at least 1853, when the Junior Order was established at the schoolhouse. The Charter Oak Library was established in the upper floor in 1855. The predecessor of the Germantown Historical Society, then known as the Site and Relic Society, used the lower floor as a museum from 1903 to 1908. In 1889 the first floor housed a private school run by Miss Annie McMurtrie and the room of Mrs. Diilon, the janitor. The Charter Oak Library still occupied the second floor, See p. 169 and did so until at least 1902. The origin of the school's name is uncertain. It was perhaps named after the ship Concord which brought the first Dutch and German immigrants to America. An alternate theory is that its foundations were built at the time of the first shot of the American Revolution fired in Concord, Massachusetts. Concord School House is a contributing property of the Colonial Germantown Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a National Historic Landmark. Several buildings within the district are also separately listed. These include the John Johnson House, across the street, and Cliveden, a block north of the school house, both National Historic Landmarks. The Germantown Mennonite Meetinghouse, Upsala, Michael Billmeyer House and Daniel Billmeyer House, all within three blocks of the school house, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Description E. lineatus has a total of 10-15 spines in its dorsal fins with the anterior spines of the first dorsal fin being much taller than the middle spines which gives this fin a concave outline. The anal fin has 11 - 12 soft rays and it has a vertebra count of 37. Its body is almost entirely scaleless except for the lateral line and a \\"corselet\\" and there is no swim bladder. It is generally iridescent blue in colour with black markings on its back made up of 3 to 5 horizontal stripes, as well as a variable amount of black or dark grey spots above the pelvic fins. Occasional specimens have extensive longitudinal stripes of light grey on their belly while other individuals have few or no such markings. Distribution Eastern tropical Pacific from San Simeon, California to northern Peru and the Gal√°pagos Islands. Fisheries No targeted fishery exists for this species, though it is taken incidentally in the course of other fishery operations.\\" Biology Eithynnus lineatus is a pelagic and oceanodromous species which is rarely recorded where the surface temperature falls below . The larvae are most commonly found at temperatures higher than . It is generally distributed in surface waters which are no more than from land.

A variety of wetland habitats occur, ranging from open water to tall herb communities. The eastern side of the ditch, which embanks the railway, is formed of railway ballast, over which a dry herb vegetation has developed. The western bank is relatively undisturbed and supports a richer assemblage, in which the locally scarce common meadow rue, Thalictrum flavum, is abundant. Where the ditch has been recently cleared, there are patches of open water, in which water crowfoot, Ranunculus aquatilis, water plantain, Alisma plantago-aquatica, and similar species are dominant; water violet, Hottonia palustris, which is at its northern limit in Britain at this site, is locally abundant. Around the open water, and in parts of the ditch that are silting-up, a tall fen vegetation occurs.

His name has been applied to various landmarks and geographical features in the Milford and Fiordland area including Mackinnon Pass, Lake Mackinnon, the Quintin Huts on Milford Track, and the St. Quintin Falls in Clinton Valley. In 1887 McKinnon was employed by the Otago Survey Department to try to find a tourist route into Milford Sound. He was unsuccessful in this first attempt but hopeful that a pass could be discovered. In 1888 the Otago Survey Department again employed McKinnon, this time with Ernest Mitchell. They were instructed to cut a track up the river and to find a pass while C.W. Adams, the chief surveyor, took a party to survey the country fringing Milford Sound. Included in the party were Thomas Mackenzie, William Soltau Pillans, and the commercial photographer, Fred Muir. McKinnon was successful and discovered a passage between the head of Lake Te Anau and Milford Sound. He and Mitchell crossed the pass and joined the surveying party on the other side. The pass was named Mackinnon Pass. The route became known as the Milford Track and this was the first practicable overland route across the South Island. After the discovery of the pass McKinnon spent time improving the track and taking regular parties of sightseers and tourists through the area. He offered a guided tour from Lake Te Anau to Sutherland Falls. He was also contracted to carry the mail between Te Anau and Milford Sound. Memorial Cairn on Mackinnon Pass On 29 November 1892 McKinnon departed to cross Lake Te Anau to go to Milford but never arrived. He was last seen sailing with a fair wind on Lake Te Anau by a hand from the Te Anau station. A search party was sent to the area in January 1893 but did not find any trace of him. His wrecked boat and belongings were discovered but his body was never recovered. He was presumed drowned in Lake Te Anau. A public subscription was raised to build the Quintin MacKinnon Memorial Cairn which stands at the summit of Mackinnon Pass.

Founded in 1997 by Mark Neale; Mountain Warehouse has grown from a single outlet store to over 330 stores in the UK, Europe, New Zealand and North America. History In 1997 Mountain Warehouse was founded as the retail partner of Karrimor International, the UK based outdoor clothing and equipment manufacturer. Investment company 21 Invest (now Investindustrial) were Karrimor's lead investor. 21 Invest sold Karrimor's core business to South African leisure group Cullinan Holdings in February 1999. The stores, that were initially branded Karrimor, were subsequently re-branded to Mountain Warehouse. Mountain Warehouse sold multi-branded outdoor clothing and equipment as well as its recently launched own brand of clothing. In August 2002 NBGI Private Equity acquired the business from 21 Invest and managing Director Mark Neale buying a majority stake in the company. CEO Neale reinvested most of his proceeds into the new acquisition. In the years that NBGI worked with Mountain Warehouse their own brand product offering increased from 5% to 80%. In July 2007 Arev, via KCAJ, its Icelandic investment fund, acquired a ¬£15m business stake in a tertiary buyout from NBGI Private Equity. A majority shareholding was procured by Mountain Warehouse management. In August 2010 the private-equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, LDC, took a 23% minority stake in the business as part of a ¬£47m buyout. The mid-market private equity division more than doubled its original investment. In November 2013 the management team led by founder and CEO Mark Neale bought out minority shareholder LDC to take full ownership of the retail chain. Mr Neale personally owns 85% of the business. The ¬£85m deal was backed by the Royal Bank of Scotland and asset management firm Alcentra. in 2017 Mountain Warehouse Holdings Limited, set up a new company ‚ÄòZakti Activeware‚Äô which was the new name for ‚ÄòMountain Warehouse Active‚Äô range, and transferred a lot of stock to the new stores. In 2018 Mountain Warehouse Holdings Limited, set up another new company ‚ÄòNeon Sheep‚Äô to break into the accessories market and so far is doing much better than Zakti Activeware. Stores Mountain Warehouse has over 330 stores in the UK, North America, Europe and New Zealand, including stores in Dublin, Ireland, Vienna, Austria, and stores in Poland including Warsaw. The first Mountain Warehouse store opened in 1997. By August 2002 Mountain Warehouse had opened a further 13 stores in factory outlet centres in the UK and one in Vienna, as well as three concession stores in UK garden centres. The London Covent Garden store was the first of Mountain Warehouse's high street stores. By 2019 Mountain Warehouse opened a further 9 stores in London, located in popular areas such as Regent Street, Fulham and Wimbledon. Mountain Warehouse purchased six of former Woolworths sites, including Fort William, Scotland, St Ives, Cornwall and Buxton, Derbyshire. Mountain Warehouse has continued to secure premises in market towns and locations popular with walkers and holidaymakers. Mountain Warehouse opened its first North America outlet store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada early 2014. It has since further expanded to other North American locations including New Jersey, United States, Burlington, Canada and Vancouver, Canada. Mountain Warehouse's headquarters are located in Victoria, London. A store is also located nearby in Victoria Place in London Victoria station. Products Mountain Warehouse has grown from a stock clearance business selling only branded products to a business that sells mainly own brand clothing, footwear and equipment. In 2004 own brands including Mountain Life, Parallel and Snapdragon made up 10% off the businesses products but by 2007 own brand products made up 65%. In 2010 the retailer introduced a more technical clothing range, Mountainlife Extreme. The Mountainlife Extreme clothing range was designed to compete with higher end brands such as The North Face and Berghaus. The Mountainlife and Parallel branding has gradually been phased out with all clothing, footwear and equipment now branded with Mountain Warehouse. Mountainlife Extreme was replaced by Mountain Warehouse Extreme, with footwear, accessories and equipment also included in the range.

Alternative names used in modern scholarship include √ìttar of the Isles and √ìttar √ìttarsson. Life √ìttar was a powerful man from the Norse-Gaelic territory of the Western Isles of Scotland, known as the Sudreyjar to the Vikings. He seized control of the Kingdom of Dublin in 1142, according to Clare Downham after having been invited by the townspeople to become their king.Downham 2007 p. 39 He is described as the grandson of √ìttar in the Annals of the Four Masters and as the son of √ìttar (McOtyr) in the Annals of Clonmacnoise. It is possible that both records are correct and that √ìttar of Dublin was the son of a man named √ìttar whose own father was also √ìttar. Either his father or grandfather was the Jarl √ìttar, killed in 1098, who is recorded as controlling half of the Isle of Man.Williams, p. 142 One source unambiguously names Jarl √ìttar of Man as the father of √ìttar of Dublin, and also names his mother, one Svanhilda \\"a Danish lady.\\"Cotter 1938, p. 24 Before his takeover of Dublin he is not specifically mentioned as holding the title jarl, but his evident access to substantial military resources and the use of the title by both his forebears and descendants suggests that he was of that rank.

Several versions of the Brut y Tywysogion record that an √ìttar based in Dublin, and described as the \\"son of the other √ìttar,\\" was active fighting as a mercenary in Wales in 1144. This √ìttar was either the king or, possibly, a son of the same name.Williams, p. 143 The expedition to Wales was intended to support Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd against his brother Owain, king of Gwynedd.

Relations with Cadwaladr apparently deteriorated and √ìttar's men eventually took him hostage and demanded a ransom, the ransom being \\"two thousand slaves.\\" Cadwaladr escaped from his erstwhile allies and made peace with his brother, who then forcibly induced the Dubliners to leave.Duffy, p. 122 Contemporary annals suggest that √ìttar was co-king with Ragnall mac Torcaill, until Ragnall was killed in a battle against the forces of Midhe (Meath) in 1145 or 1146: \\"A slaughter was made of the foreigners of Ath-cliath [Dublin] by the people of East Meath, where two hundred persons were slain, together with Raghnall Mac Torcaill, Mormaer of Ath-cliath, and Jufraigh, and many others of their chieftains.\\"Annals of the Four Masters 1146.3[1148] Raghnall was probably subordinate to √ìttar.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, p. 871 This is supported by the use of the title mormaer to describe Ragnall in the Annals of the Four Masters, though other annals call him king (in Irish \\"r√≠\\"). √ìttar retained control of Dublin until 1148 when he was \\"treacherously killed\\" by the Meic Torcaill, the kin of Ragnall mac Torcaill.Annals of Tigernach (T1148.3) According to Downham, √ìttar and the sons of Torcall initially co-operated, \\"...but a succession dispute emerged which led to √ìttar's death in 1148\\". Posterity He was married to Helga daughter of Tolokunger, a Danish commander, and was the father of Thorfinus filius Oter, who was described as the most powerful jarl (princeps) in the Western Isles.Cotter 1938, p. 25 He is claimed as an ancestor by the Cotter family of County Cork, Ireland, whose original name was Mac Oitir (son of √ìttar), 'through √ìttar's son Thorfin and grandson Therulfe.'√ì Murchadha, p. 261 Fiction √ìttar, the variant Irish spelling Otir is used, appears as a character in The Summer of the Danes by Ellis Peters in the Brother Cadfael series. The book uses Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd's attempt to reclaim his lands with the help of a \\"Danish\\" fleet as the background to the plot. Notes References * Cotter, G. de P.

Formerly covering an area of around 3000 square kilometres, they were almost completely drained following the 1991 uprisings in Iraq and have in recent years been reflooded. Characteristics The Central Marshes stretched between Nasiriyah, Al-'Uzair (Ezra's Tomb) and Al-Qurnah and were mainly fed by the Tigris and its distributaries (the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir). They were drained by the (partially artificial) Prosperity Canal, and by the Glory River. The Central Marshes were characterised by tall qasab reeds but included a number of freshwater lakes, of which the largest were the Haur az-Zikri and Umm al-Binni (literally \\"mother of binni\\", the latter being a species of barbel.)The Physical Characteristics of the Mesopotamian Marshlands, edenagain.org The marshes support breeding populations of the Basra reed-warbler and marbled teal, along with several other species of non-breeding birds.Central Marshes, birdlife.org It was feared that the Levant darter (Anhinga rufa chantrei), a subspecies of the African darter, and the maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter had disappeared entirely, but small and threatened populations remain of both.Abed, J.M.

The Status of the Iraq Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli Hayman 1956 and Eurasian Otter Lutra lutra Linnaeus 1758 in Iraq. IUCN Otter Spec. Group Bull. 30(1). It is feared that the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat (Nesokia bunnii, syn. Erythronesokia bunnii), which had only been described from specimens obtained in the Central Marshes, is extinct. The area was formerly populated by the Marsh Arabs or Ma'dan, who grazed buffalo on the natural vegetation and carried out cultivation of rice. Draining By the early 1980s, it was evident that irrigation projects were already affecting water levels in the marshes.Spencer, M. The Marsh Arabs Revisited Saudi Aramco World, April 1982 In the early 1990s, the government of Iraq undertook a series of major drainage projects, at least partly in retribution for the events of the 1991 uprisings, and to prevent the area being used as a refuge by militias. The flow southwards from the distributary streams of the Tigris was blocked by large embankments and discharged into the Al-Amarah or Glory Canal, resulting in the loss of two-thirds of the Central Marshes by as early as 1993. A further canal, the Prosperity Canal, was constructed to prevent any overflow into the marsh from the main channel of the Tigris as it ran southwards from Qalat Saleh.The Physical Characteristics of the Mesopotamian Marshlands, edenagain.org By the late 1990s, the Central Marsh had become completely desiccated, suffering the most severe damage of the three main areas of wetland. By 2000, United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared. Reflooding Following the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, embankments and drainage works were broken open, and the marshes began to reflood. The Central Marshes showed little recovery through 2003, but by early 2004 a patchwork of lakes had appeared in northern areas; there was flooding in southern areas which had previously been dry since the early 1990s.Iraq Marshlands Restoration Program, iraqmarshes.org, p.6 There has been some corresponding recolonisation by the natural marsh vegetation since that time, and return of some species of fish and birds, although recovery of the Central Marshes has been much slower compared to the Huwaizah and Hammar Marshes; the most severely damaged sections of the wetlands have yet to show any signs of regeneration.Missan Governorate Assessment Report, UNHCR, 2006, p.44 Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat is suspected to have become extinct.

In its heyday, Denison Town consisted of an inn, post office, church and cemetery, and was the occasional venue for sittings of the Local Court. Local industries included the farming of wheat, sheep and cattle, alongside sporadic prospecting for silver ore. In 1861 the inn, named the Denison Hotel, was the scene of an attempted robbery by bushrangers who had carried out previous attacks around Mudgee. The innkeeper and patrons fought off the robbers, but the incident led to calls for a permanent police presence in the town. Denison Town Post Office opened on 1 January 1860 and closed in 1893. A request for a local school was rejected in 1906. Eventually the opening of lead mines at nearby Leadville, as well as being bypassed by the main local railway, resulted in Denison Town becoming a ghost town. One building and the pioneer cemetery remained. Newspaper reports from the 1930s indicated that the cemetery, which contained around 50 graves, was neglected and used for grazing by local livestock.

Background The story is based on an Indian urban legend that tells of a Muslim who was forced to have his arm amputated after an accident, and died a few months later, but after death became a ghost and began wandering about in search of his limb. Plot The central character of the story is a doctor, Sir Dominic Holden, who has had a long spell of service in British India first as a military doctor and then as a private surgeon in Bombay. Once when he was posted at Peshawar, then a main city of undivided Punjab (hence a part of India), he had to attend a poor Afghan whose one hand was in such a bad state due to the growth of a gangrene, that the only way to save his life was to amputate it. The operation was performed and Dr. Holden asked for the amputated hand as his fees. Dr. Holden had a hobby of collecting discarded limbs, organs, cysts from living and dead humans and thus wanted to add the \\"brown hand\\" to his collection. The Afghan being Islamic, refused to part with his amputated hand, as it breached the rule of his religion which stated amputated body parts to be kept with the owner himself. But Dr. Holden promised to return the Afghan his hand before his death and took the hand with him to his house in Bombay. Dr. Holden retired soon after and settled in Wiltshire. Then one night he was awakened by someone pulling his clothes - the ghost of his old Afghan patient. Dr. Holden understood that the Afghan had died and his ghost wanted back the amputated hand. From then onwards, the ghost haunted the doctor's lab every night for four years looking for his hand. But the ghost failed to find the hand since it had been damaged in a fire that broke out at the doctor's house in Bombay. The recurring visit of the ghost, however, had made the life of Dr. Holden and his wife, Lady Holden, miserable and the effect on their health was prominent. A doctor known for his steel nerves had now become a scared individual. The protagonist of the story, Dr. Holden's nephew, Hardecar decided to solve this problem. He spent his first night in the lab and saw the Afghan searching for his hand. The next day, Dr. Holden explained him everything in details and Hardecar left for London. Hardecar, a doctor himself, went through a book on spirits and found that certain spirits could not leave the living world because of them being strongly attached to something or someone existing in this world. Hardecar decided to try his luck and left for Chadwell where a friend of his was the home surgeon at a hospital for sailors. The home surgeon provided Hardecar with an amputated hand of an Indian sailor as the requirement was a \\"brown hand\\". Hardecar returned to Wiltshire and placed the hand in a jar and placed it in his uncle's lab. Hardecar stayed awake as the Afghan ghost came visiting as usual. But Hardecar's experiment failed as the Afghan on seeing the hand, wailed in agony and smashed the jar on the floor before disappearing. Next morning, Hardecar realised his mistake as he had brought the left hand of the sailor while the Afghan had had his right hand separated. Hardecar rushed back to Chadwell and luckily got the right hand of the sailor. He returned and placed the hand in a jar in the lab just like the previous day. Dr. Holden forbade Hardecar from sleeping in the lab as he feared risking his nephew's life. That night, Hardecar again saw somebody approaching him while he tried to sleep. But it wasn't any ghost but his uncle who seemed overwhelmed with joy and had suddenly regained some of the energy he possessed earlier. Dr. Holden stated that the ghost had finally found his amputated hand and before leaving, he had bowed thrice in front of him, in a way similar to how Afghans pay respect. The Holdens lived on peacefully and consulted Hardecar for every major decisions they took thereafter. Before he died, Dr. Holden named Hardecar as the heir to his property.

He is buried at the Luga≈æi Cemetery.  Early life  Cimze was born at the Rauna Manor's Cimze dairy farm (hoflage) in the family of a manor's dairy farm overseer Andreas (Ansis) Cimze and his wife Anne as the first child of 8 for his parents. His initial education came from Rauna Parish School where he also learned to play the organ. From the age of sixteen he worked as a private tutor; later he was a teacher at Valmiera Parish School and an organist.  Education  In 1836 Cimze went to Germany to study at Weissenfels Teachers' Seminary which he finished in 1838. This was where he learned to play the violin and piano and improved his skills as an organist. In 1838‚Äî39 he was an external student at Berlin University where he attended lectures on mathematics, didactics and the theory of music. His music professor was Ludwig Christian Erk, a collector, harmoniser, publisher and researcher of German folk songs.  Vidzeme Teachers' Seminary  Upon returning from Germany, from 1839 and to the end of his life, Cimze headed Vidzeme Teachers' Seminary where he taught future teachers the conducting of choirs and harmonisation of folk songs. Cimze followed the principles of Johann Pestalozzi and Adolph Diesterweg and all education was conducted in German. During his forty-two years of work at the Teachers' Seminary Cimze educated more than four hundred students who subsequently became Latvian and Estonian teachers. Being a teacher in the 19th century meant being also an educator, a musician, a literary and public figure. In the second half of the 19th century teachers organised choirs and worked with them and cultural societies.  Musical legacy  Cimze on a 2014 Latvian stamp JƒÅnis Cimze promoted the development of Latvian choral singing and the cultivation of a cappella performance. His collection of songs for choirs \\"Dziesmu rota\\" (A Garland of Songs) was published in eight parts in 1872‚Äî84. This first ever professional collection of songs for choirs in Latvia formed the foundation of Latvian choir culture. Parts II (1872), III (1874), IV (1875) and VII (1884) of \\"Dziesmu rota\\", which go under the title of \\"Lauku puƒ∑es\\" (Wild Flowers), are the first collections of Latvian folk songs arrangements and represent a number of folk song genres: songs of seasons and family customs, work songs, farewell songs of recruits and conscripts, songs of orphans as well as songs for games and lullabies. JƒÅnis Cimze was the first prominent Latvian figure in music, whose example inspired extensive collection, publishing, arrangement and research of folk music. It fostered the development of the choir-singing movement and the creation of new original compositions. Thanks to the activities of Cimze and his students, the first All-Estonian (1869) and All-Latvian (1873) Song Festivals were held. Cimze was among those who conceived the idea of the event, while his student and associate Indriƒ∑is Zƒ´le was one of the chief conductors at the Song Festival. The programme of the Song Festival included several arrangements of folk songs by Cimze and his brother DƒÅvid. Cimze's German sentiments surfaced as he compared the three brothers making the dowry- chest for their sister in the song \\"Rƒ´ga dimd\\" (Riga resounds) to the German nobility, the Lutheran Church and the German Riga. For this he was severely criticised by Atis Kronvalds.

The film stars Emraan Hashmi, Neha Sharma and Arjan Bajwa in the lead. It was released on 8 October 2010. Mostly shot in Australia and South Africa, the film is based on the controversy regarding the allegedly racial attacks on Indian students in Australia between 2007 and 2010.

One day, his uncle Joseph (Gulshan Grover) catches him and this changes his personality completely, he changes his name to Suraj Bhardwaj and his uncle sends him to Australia. At the airport, he meets Romi Latti, a teenager who got a scholarship to a University College. He also meets Suhani (Neha Sharma), a young girl who has come to pick Romi up. Suraj gets attracted to Suhani, and therefore he pretends to be Romi and leaves with Suhani. When Suhani finds out that he is not the real Romi, Suraj makes a run for it. Suraj then stays with Goldie (Mashhoor Amrohi), a responsible adult living with his brothers. While Suraj is at a grocery store, on phone with his uncle Joseph, he finds that Australians are attacking the shopkeeper because he is a Muslim, so Suraj finds a gun and comes out. He has the Australians on the gunpoint as the police arrive. Suraj remembers that his uncle told him not to get in any type of trouble with the police, so Suraj runs away. Suraj hides in Nicole's car, although he finds out Nicole is the younger sister of the Attackers. Nicole works in a strip club named 'Duke's Club'. Suraj and Suhani had a dispute due to which he makes out with Nicole in a club. Nicole proposes Jai and he reciprocates, due to being aroused. But later, when Suraj has to pick between Suhani and Nicole, he picks Suhani and takes the duty to be Suhani's brother, Samarth's (Arjan Bajwa) driver.

When Suraj comes to know about Samarth's plan, Samarth beats Suraj and tells him that he is doing all this because his sister Sheena (Smiley Suri) was also murdered by the Australians once(Actually Sheena was in love with an Australian and she became pregnant with his child, which infuriated Samarth and he decides to abort the child, despite knowing the fact that she will die because of it, due to the abortion she ends up dead). But when he accidentally shoots Suraj, Romi comes up behind him with a shovel and hits it on Samarth's head and he dies.

All the songs were very popular on release, with the songs \\"Challa\\", \\"Mere Bina\\" and \\"Tujhi Mein\\" topping the charts everywhere. The Film's background score was composed by Raju Singh. =Track listing= =Reception= Atta Khan from planet Bollywood rated the album 7/10 and said \\"The music of Crook is another rendezvous to Pritam's rock annals and the first album to do that since last year‚Äôs awesome Tum Mile. But it's a much shorter album with only four original songs and only two of these being rock anthems so it doesn't quite match Tum Mile's soundtrack for depth, quality, and consistency. However whilst \\"Challa\\" and \\"Kya\\" will not be missed, \\"Mere Bina\\" and \\"Tujhi Mein\\" are a MUST listen for fans and you know who you are. Furthermore, the remixes at Tracks 5-8 are simply superb! So forget about the prospects of Crook as a film- when you have music that sounds this enjoyable you can only call this (Bhatt/Pritam) collaboration special and we await their next soundtrack with breath. And yes, Pritam has satisfied once again.\\" NDTV India quoted, \\"Music composer Pritam Chakraborty, who is a favourite of the Bhatt camp, brings forth another likable soundtrack in forthcoming film Crook. Even though the compositions fall under his signature style and not much experimentation is involved, the tracks do have the potential of getting noticed.\\" Critical reception =India= The reception of the film in India has been mixed. The critics praised the story and music but criticized the execution. However, many of them praised the erotic scenes between Emraan Hashmi and Shella Allen. The scenes have become quite popular as well. One critic writes praises the music, writing: \\"this along with its already popular songs makes Crook a full on entertainment package that should not be missed when it releases all over on 8 October\\". Movie critic Taran Adarsh, criticized the film as a \\"half-hearted effort\\", but praises Mohit Suri's handling of the subject during the second hour of the film. Another critic praised the film for presenting \\"an altogether different approach to the situation and (the director) takes both the sides and speaks in favour of Indians and as well as the Australians. Among negative reviews, a critic at India Today complained that the film racially vilifies Australians as: Also that \\"it is badly directed and doesn't even have that one redeeming feature of all\\" A critic at Rediff.com complained of a weak script and story line. A reviewer at bollyspice.com said that the film was \\"too insensitive\\" and \\"superficial\\". =Australia= One media outlet in Australia voiced concern about the film, repeating Indian newspaper reviews that Crook portrayed Australia as \\"A country of ex-convicts. A country where they sleep with each other without marrying. A country where they don't take care of their families. Yes that's the sort of venom that's spewed against the Australians in Crook.\\" Among Australia's local Indian population, Gautam Gupta, spokesman for the Federation of Indian Students criticized the piece, saying: \\"They have performed their research so badly, it's shocking.\\" He also complained that, far from helping the situation, that the film could help inflame tensions. Director Mohit Suri responded to these charges, rejecting the claims of bias. The Hindustan Times quoted Suri saying: Responding to allegations that the film is \\"poorly researched\\", Suri says, \\"I have just made a film. At 28, don‚Äôt expect me to have a cure for racism worldwide. I have just expressed my opinion.\\" Suri also complained that during the production of the film: Awards and nominations ;6th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards Nominated * Apsara Award for Best Music - Pritam * Apsara Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role - Arjan Bajwa ;3rd Mirchi Music Awards Nominated * Best Programmer & Arranger of the Year - Jim Satya, Johan Folke and DJ Phukan - \\"Mere Bina\\" References External links * Category:2010 films Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:2010 action thriller films Category:Indian films Category:Hindi-language films Category:Indian action thriller films Category:Films shot in Australia Category:Films featuring songs by Pritam Category:Films about racism Category:Films set in Australia Category:Films directed by Mohit Suri ","title":"Crook (film)"},{"id":"28221672","title":"Claus J√∏rgensen (racewalker)"},{"id":"28221683","text":"Joshua Chiu Ban It (; ‚Äì 2016) was the Bishop of Singapore from 1966 to 1981,Bishops of Singapore and was the first indigenous Bishop of Singapore.

It is the smallest suburb in the city of Ballarat in terms of both area and population, which at the was just 164 people. The area is a mix of residential and commercial, as it has been since it came into existence at the beginning of the gold rush. In the present time it is mainly known for its restaurants and pubs, as well as fast food. The suburb boundaries are that of Mair, East, Barkly, Steinfield and Peel Streets. Bakery Hill is one of the most historic places in Ballarat and is culturally important to the city. At what is now 29 St. Paul's Way, several large public meetings were held before and after the Eureka Stockade. It is most likely to be the site that insurgents swore the Eureka oath while pledging allegiance to the Southern Cross on 1 December 1854. It was also one of the richest mining leads in Australia and was the site where the Welcome Nugget was discovered on 9 June 1858. Topography The suburb is located on a hill named for the bakery that existed on the site from the 1850s. The boundary of Bakery Hill is Peel Street to the west; Mair Street to the north; East Street to the east and Steinfield Street to the south. It was officially gazetted from Ballarat in 1992. History Swearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross on 1 December 1854 on Bakery Hill -- watercolour by Charles Doudiet Bakery Hill dates back to the foundation of Ballarat and the town of East Ballarat. The suburb is located to the East of Ballarat, which known for its lack of town planning. East Ballarat developed organically around the site of gold mines. The Eureka Stockade began when insurgents swore the Eureka oath, their allegiance to the Southern Cross on 1 December 1854. Today, a flag pole flies the Eureka Flag to welcome those who arrive at the city from the East. The area was of prime importance to commerce and the early inhabitants of Ballarat because it was the location where Victoria Street (the road to Melbourne) met Main Road (the road to Geelong). Bridge Mall and Street are named after the first bridge to cross the Yarrowee River, which existed until the river was directed underground. The street's width reflects the width of the original bridge.http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/140650/download-report The street is six feet higher than it was in the 1850s and 1860s after it was built up to avoid flooding, which had become frequent due to extensive mining on the Black Hill Flats.Ibid. Heritage The site of the Eureka Stockade meetings is now a parcel of land which subject to a major new residential complex, which is currently being constructed.http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/3390872/landscaping.pdf For a hundred years the site had a school positioned on it, Ballarat East State School No.1919 (St. Paul's) from 1877, which was demolished in the 1960s and turned into a carpark.http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/School_Records_- _Haymes_Children There are a number of heritage buildings which date back to the 1850s. The area is known for its unique architecture, including an old three-storey pub located at 3 Peel Street, formerly North Grand Hotel, and a series of semi-detached shops at 26 Bridge Mall. The hotel was famous for the murder of a barmaid, Winifred Brooks, on 29 December 1932 for which Patrick Sheedy was convicted and executed.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/68011804 St. Paul's Anglican Church, built in 1865, is significant for its architecture because of a series of changes made to the building to cope with mining activity. It was built on top of an earlier church which had collapsed because of mining activity. The old school located at the corner of Humffray Street and Mair Street was built in 1876.https://victoriancollections.net.au/items/55d57cb92162f40c70ee25f5 It operated as a primary school, Humffrey Street State School (No. 34), until the 1990s during the Kennett Government's rationalisation of the education system.

It now houses the Lincoln Park Historical Museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History In the late 1930s, the city of Lincoln Park had a need for a new post office building. Congressional approval was obtained in 1938, and the land where this building stands was obtained for $15,000. The design of this building, created by supervising architect of the treasury Louis A. Simon, was used for a number of other post offices in the state of Michigan. The building was constructed by the Henry Dattner Co., who began construction in December 1938. The final cost of construction was $80,000. The Lincoln Park Post Office was dedicated on August 5, 1939, serving as a branch of the Detroit Post Office. Lincoln Park Post Office began operating as an independent post office in 1954. However, the Postal Service's Lincoln Park operations eventually outgrew the size of the building. The Post Office left the building in 1991. The Lincoln Park Historical Society purchased the building, renovated it, and opened it to the public. The building is now the home of the Lincoln Park Historical Museum. Description The former Lincoln Park Post Office is a one-story, flat-roofed building built of concrete and steel and faced with tan brick. St sits on a raised basement faced with limestone; limestone is also used for the parapet cap and a stringcourse below. he main facade is symmetrical, with a center entrance and two windows on each side. The outer windows are atop limestone panels. The inner window openings are broader and higher, rising to the stringcourse beneath the parapet, with the windows vertically centered between limestone panels. The front entrance is reached by a flight of stairs, and stone carvings on a panel over the entryway represent three modes of mail transportation: air, rail, and ship. The simpler side elevations have six windows apiece. One side has a basement access stairs. The rear loading dock area has been renovated with vinyl siding. The interior one- and-one-half-story main floor contains a lobby, Postmater's office, and mail workroom. The public lobby measures approximately 45 feet by 13 feet, and has a terrazzo floor with marble wainscoting. The lobby originally housed a mural, Hauling in the Nets, by Zoltan Sepeshy. The mural is now located in the Marine Museum on Beaver Island. The postmaster's office measures approximately 12 feet by 14 feet, and the mail workroom approximately 40 feet by 59 feet. The basement contains three storage rooms.

Etymology The name Froggatt could take its name from several derivations including Frog Cottage (Old English Frogga Cot), and in 1203 a document recorded the settlement here as being Froggegate. History In the thirteenth century the manor of Baslow was divided into two moieties, one going to the Vernons and the other to the Bassetts. Froggatt or Froggecotes as it was at that time was held by the Bassets. About 1290 John Froggecotes of Froggecotes bought land and property including a grove of trees from Simon Bassett. This land, plus more that was purchased from time to time, remained in the family until 1752 when the senior branch of the family died out. John Froggecotes has many living descendants from a junior branch of the family headed by Thomas Froggott of Folds Farm, Calver. Culture and community Froggatt has a place of worship, a Wesleyan chapel and a pub, the Chequers Inn. Landmarks The village has a quaint seventeenth-century bridge, unusual in that it has two different shaped and sized arches. There is a gritstone escarpment called Froggatt Edge nearby.

Name The Latin name of this species, cruxmelitensis, refers to the arrangement of the white nematocyst capsules (stinging organs) in the distinctive pattern of a Maltese Cross. In 2010, Natural England, the Guardian and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History ran a competition asking members of the public to provide a common name for this species. The name St John's jellyfish was eventually chosen. Runner up names included Marmalade shred jellyfish and Maltese cross medusa. Description C. cruxmelitensis is the smallest member of the stalked jellyfishes growing to a maximum of 1.2 cm in diameter and 0.8 cm in height. It characteristically appears 'stalkless', although in fact it attaches to its location via a short stalk that terminates in a broad basal disc. It appears to have the unusual capacity to hold itself very rigidly in this posture, even when subjected to agitation caused by tidal flow. Calvadosia cruxmelitensis has a translucent, maroon, broad funnel-shaped bell which is divided by hollow septa. The septa walls contain the gonads, which are thick, linear and Y-shaped, joining at the base of the bell and then extending outwards to the arms. It has eight arms which are arranged in a circle. On the end of each arm is a cluster of up to thirty five tentacles, each of which has a rounded head. Unlike Haliclystus salpinx, C. cruxmelitensis does not have tentacle anchors. Distribution Originally identified inhabiting Wembury Bay, Devon, C. cruxmelitensis is now known to live on the Atlantic coasts of Ireland and the south-west coast of England, specifically from Swanage to North Devon. The English population has undergone a severe reduction in size in recent years, its numbers dropping by 90% from the 1970s to 2005. Habitat It is found on rocky shores which are exposed to moderately strong currents and waves. It lives in shallow water (sublittorally) or close the low tide mark (intertidally). Unlike most stalked jellyfish it does not attach itself to marine eelgrass, preferring to inhabit Irish moss and false Irish moss. Lifecycle Members of this species are gonochoristic, that is they are either male or female in gender. Individuals are believed to reach sexual maturity at about half of their maximum size. Gametes are produced from the gonads, which are located on the sepal walls, and shed into the surrounding water where fertilisation takes place. The resultant zygote develops into a free swimming planula larva before attaching itself to a suitable site. Once attached the larva encysts before developing into a small polyp followed by the adult form.Saskiya Richards 2008. Lucernariopsis cruxmelitensis. A stalked jellyfish. Marine Life Information Network: Biology and Sensitivity Key Information Sub-programme [on-line]. Plymouth: Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. [cited 29 July 2010]. Available from: http://www.marlin.ac.uk/speciesinformation.php?speciesID=3734 Like all stalked jellyfish, a single C. cruximelitensis individual is believed to live for only one year. Numbers of this species in a given location are greatest in mid- winter and lowest in mid-summer. Genome and phylogenetic position A draft genome has been published and its phylogenetic position relative to other Cnidaria has been determined using genome-scale data . Its genome is relatively compact (~210 megabases) compared to other cnidarians and other animals .

It was founded in 1850 on the site of a medieval Byzantine monastery where the relics of St. Clement were supposedly kept before their removal to San Clemente by Saints Cyril and Methodius. The early Christians are supposed to have kept the relics in a grotto which could be visited only on the anniversary of his death. William Rubruck described it as a church \\"built by the hands of angels\\". The Byzantine monastery, probably founded in the 8th century by icon-venerators fleeing persecution in their homeland, had eight chapels of several storeys and an inn accessed by a stairway. The caves of Inkerman were surveyed by Peter Simon Pallas in 1793 and looted by the British in the 1850s. The Russians added two churches, commemorating the Borki Incident (1895) and the Crimean War (1905). The monastery was damaged by the 1927 Crimean earthquakes and was closed between 1931 and 1991. During World War II the caves housed the officers of a Soviet army defending Sevastopol. Several churches were taken down by the Soviets.

There was already a station on the Erewash Line, known as Langley Mill and Eastwood, and a Great Northern station called Eastwood and Langley Mill, which opened in 1847 and 1876 respectively. Because this branch station had no passenger connection to the earlier one, it was regarded by the railway as a separate station and was even shown as such on Ordnance Survey maps even though the platforms were adjacent.This unusual state of affairs is present with Manchester Victoria and Exchange stations, where a platform met end to end, but these were opened by different companies Snip from Nineteenth Century Ordnance Survey map showing two stations. This carried on until at least 1940 History The line came into being as competition for the GNR's branch. It was completed as far as Heanor by 1890, but took another five years to reach Langley Mill where it joined a line called the Heanor Goods Branch which actually connected to a Butterley Company line to a group of collieries around Heanor.Midland Railway System Maps,(The Distance Diagrams) Volume 2 (1998) Teignmouth: Peter Kay It then passed along a short tightly curved spur to reach the platform with its own waiting room and toilet.

It is near the River Dove and the town of Ashbourne. Mapleton has a post office, a pub called the Okeover Arms and a church. In 2011, according to census data, the Parish had a population of 147 people. There is an annual event in which people jump off of the Mapleton Bridge to raise money for charity.  Etymology of the toponym  The name Mapleton is derived from the old English words of maple and t≈´n. The word maple plainly refers to the deciduous species of tree native to the area, with t≈´n being a descriptive term for an enclosure, a farmstead, a village or an estate.  History  In the early 1870s, John Marius Wilson described the village in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales. This is the description he gave the village: :\\"MAPPLETON, a village and a parish in Ashborne district, Derby. The village stands on the River Dove, at the boundary with Stafford, 1¬æ mile NW of Ashborne r. station; is a pleasant place; has a post office under Ashbourne, a bridge over the Dove, and a good inn; and is a resort of anglers. The parish comprises 778 acres. Real property, ¬£2,202. Pop., 185. Houses, 39. The property is subdivided. The manor belongs to J. G. Johnson, Esq.\\" Transcripts from Kelly's Directory of the Counties of Derby, Notts, Leicester and Rutland described both a post office and a school as follows; :\\"POST OFFICE.‚ÄîMrs. Fanny Grindey, sub-postmistress. Letters arrive from Ashborne at 7 a.m. ; dispatched at 5.40 p.m. ; there is no Sunday delivery. Ashborne is the nearest money order & telegraph office\\" :\\"National School (mixed), erected in 1876, for 50 children; average attendance, 30; Miss Amelia Hooper, mistress\\" However, both of the above have since been closed.  Places of interest  = Mapleton Church = Mapleton has one church, the Church of St. Mary. It was first mentioned in records in the reign of Edward I. Further information on the church after that point was relatively scarce until a survey was conducted in the reign of Edward VI in 1547. The current building was built in the mid-18th century, one hundred years after the Parliamentary Commissioners declared that the church was 'fit to be disused' in 1650. James Gibbs, the architect who designed the church, was a pupil of Sir Christopher Wren. He also designed the nave of Derby Cathedral. The Church is a Grade II* listed building.  Demographics  = Population = A graph to show the variations in population over time in the parish of Mapleton, Derbyshire The first national census was held in 1801. At the time of this census the population of the parish of Mapleton stood at 162 people. Subsequent Census data showed an increase of population until the 1821 census in which the population grew to 201 people. However, a population decrease was seen in the 1831 census when the population fell to just 180 people. The following three censuses (1841‚Äì81) record a population of around 200 people within the parish (give or take four people). The population of Mapleton peaked in the next census in 1891 to 225 within the parish, an increase of 29 people. Thereafter, with the exception of two small increases in population in 1921 and 1961, the population of the village remained in decline until the present day in which the most recent census showed a population of 147 in 2011. = Population's occupation = A pie chart to show the occupational statistics of the people in the Parish of Mapleton, Derbyshire as reported by the 2011 Census.A pie chart to show the occupational statistics of the people in the Parish of Mapleton, Derbyshire as reported by the 1881 Census.The most popular occupational group is that of people in \\"professional occupations\\" with 17 of the people in the parish employed in this sector.

Unfortunately, a large portion of the parish's occupations are unknown. \\"domestic offices or services\\" and \\"general commodities\\" are the next two biggest sectors, each with 26 people from the parish recording these as their occupations.

It gives an example of the serious problems in UK labour law at the beginning of the 20th century. Scope =Type of workplace= The workplaces to which the act applies are, first, \\" factories \\" and \\" workshops \\"; secondly, laundries, docks, wharves, &c.;, enumerated above as introduced and regulated partially only by the act of 1895 and subsequent acts. Apart from this secondary list, and having regard to workplaces which remain undefined by the law, the act may broadly be said to apply to premises, rooms or places in which manual labour, with or without the aid of mechanical power, is exercised for gain in or incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, washing, cleaning or finishing or adapting for sale of any article or part of any article. If steam, water or other mechanical power is used in aid of the manufacturing process, the workplace is a factory; if not, it is a workshop. There is, however, a list of eighteen classes of works (brought under the factory law for reasons of safety, etc., before workshops generally were regulated) which are defined as factories whether power is used in them or not. Factories are, again, subdivided into textile and non-textile: they are textile if the machinery is employed in preparing, manufacturing or finishing cotton, wool, hair, silk, flax, hemp, jute, tow, China grass, coconut fibre or other like material either separately or mixed together, or mixed with any other material, or any fabric made thereof; all other factories are non-textile. The distinction turns on the historical origin of factory regulation and the regulations in textile factories remain in some respects slightly more stringent than in the non-textile factories and workshops, though the general provisions are almost the same. Three special classes of workshops have for certain purposes to be distinguished from ordinary workshops, which include tenement workshops: :(a) Domestic workshops, i.e. any private house, room or place, which, though used as a dwelling, is by reason of the work carried on there a workshop, and in which the only persons employed are members of the same family, dwelling there alone‚Äîin these women's hours are unrestricted; :(b) Women's workshops, in which neither children nor young persons are employed‚Äîin these a more elastic arrangement of hours is permissible than in ordinary workshops; :(c) Workshops in which men only are employed‚Äîthese come under the same general regulations in regard to sanitation as other workshops, also under the provisions of the Factory Act as regards security, and, if certified by the secretary of state, may be brought under special regulations. They are otherwise outside the scope of the act of 1901. =People protected= The person to whom the regulations apply in the above- defined workplaces are children, i.e. persons between the ages of twelve and fourteen, young persons, i.e. boys or girls between the ages of fourteen (or if an educational certificate has been obtained, thirteen) and eighteen years of age, and women, i.e. females above the age of eighteen; these are all \\"protected\\" persons to whom the general provisions of the act, inclusive of the regulation of hours and times of employment, apply. To adult men generally those provisions broadly only apply which are aimed at securing sanitation and safety in the conduct of the manufacturing process. The person generally responsible for observance of the provisions of the law, whether these relate to health, safety, limitation of the hours of labour or other matters, is the occupier (a term undefined in the act) of the factory, workshop or laundry. There are, however, limits to his responsibility, :(a) generally, where the occupier has used due diligence to enforce the execution of the act, and can show that another person, whether agent, servant, workman or other person, is the real offender; :(b) specially in a factory the sections relating to employment of protected persons, where the owner or hirer of a machine or implement driven by mechanical power is some person other than the occupier of the factory, the owner or hirer, so far as respects any offence against the act committed in relation to a person who is employed in connexion with the machine or implement, and is in the employment or pay of the owner or hirer, shall be deemed to be the occupier of the factory; :(c) for the one purpose of reporting accidents, the actual employer of the person injured in any factory or workshop is bound under penalty immediately to report the same to the occupier; :(d) so far as relates to sanitary conditions, fencing of machinery, affixing of notices in tenement factories, the owner (as defined by the Public Health Act 1875), generally speaking, takes the place of the occupier. Employment in a factory or workshop includes work whether for wages or not: :(a) in a manufacturing process or handicraft, :(b) in cleaning any place used for the same, :(c) in cleaning or oiling any part of the machinery, :(d) any work whatsoever incidental to the process or handicraft, or connected with the article made. Persons found in any part of the factory or workshop, where machinery is used or manufacture carried on, except at meal-times, or when machinery is stopped, are deemed to be employed until the contrary is proved. The act, however, does not apply to employment for the sole purpose of repairing the premises or machinery, nor to the process of preserving and curing fish immediately upon its arrival in the fishing boats in order to prevent the fish from being destroyed or spoiled, nor to the process of cleaning and preparing fruit so far as is necessary to prevent it from spoiling during the months of June, July, August and September. Certain light handicrafts carried on by a family only in a private house or room at irregular intervals are also outside the scope of the act. Health and safety The foremost provisions are those relating to the sanitary condition of the workplaces and the general security of every class of worker. Every factory must be kept in a cleanly condition, free from noxious effluvia, ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, gases, vapours, dust or other impurities generated in the manufacture; must be provided with sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences separate for the sexes; must not be overcrowded (not less than . during the day, 400 during overtime, for each worker). In these matters the law of public health takes in workshops the place of the Factory Act, the requirements being substantially the same. Although, however, primarily the officers of the district council enforce the sanitary provisions in workshops, the government factory inspectors may give notice of any defect in them to the district council in whose district they are situate; and if proceedings are not taken within one month by the latter, the factory inspector may act in default and recover expenses from the district council. This power does not extend to domestic workshops which are under the law relating to public health so far as general sanitation is concerned. General powers are reserved to the secretary of state, where he is satisfied that the Factory Act or law relating to public health as regards workplaces has not been carried out by any district council, to authorize a factory inspector during a period named in his order to act instead of the district council. Other general sanitary provisions administered by the government inspectors are the requirement in factories and workshops of washing conveniences where poisonous substances are used; adequate measures for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature of such a kind as will not interfere with the purity of the air in each room in which any person is employed; maintenance of sufficient means of ventilation in every room in a factory or workshop (in conformity with such standard as may be prescribed by order of the secretary of state); provision of a fan to carry off injurious dust, gas or other impurity, and prevent their inhalation in any factory or workshop; drainage of floors where wet processes are carried on. For laundries and bakehouses there are further sanitary regulations; e.g. in laundries all stoves for heating irons shall be sufficiently separated from any ironing-room or ironing-table, and the floors shall be \\" drained in such a manner as will allow the water to flow off freely \\"; and in bakehouses a cistern supplying water to a bakehouse must be quite separate from that supplying water to a water-closet, and the latter may not communicate directly with the bakehouse. Use of underground bakehouses (i.e. a baking room with floor more than . below the ground adjoining) is prohibited, except where already used at the passing of the act; further, in these cases, after 1 January 1904, a certificate as to suitability in light, ventilation, &c.;, must be obtained from the district council. In other trades certified by the secretary of state further sanitary regulations may be made to increase security for health by special rules to be presently touched on. The secretary of state may also make sanitary requirements a condition of granting such exceptions to the general law as he is empowered to grant. In factories, as distinct from workshops, a periodical lime washing (or washing with hot water and soap where paint and varnish have been used) of all inside walls and ceilings once at least in every fourteen months is generally required (in bakehouses once in six months). As regards sufficiency and suitability of sanitary accommodation, the standards determined by order of the secretary of state shall be observed in the districts to which it is made applicable. An order was made called the Sanitary Accommodation Order, on 4 February 1903, the definitions and standards in which have also been widely adopted by local sanitary authorities in districts where the Order itself has no legal force, the local authority having parallel power under the Public Health Act of 1890. Machinery Security in the use of machinery is provided for by precautions as regards the cleaning of machinery in motion and working between the fixed and traversing parts of self-acting machines driven by power, by fencing of machinery, and by empowering inspectors to obtain an order from a court of summary jurisdiction to prohibit the use, temporarily or absolutely, of machinery, ways, works or plant, including use of a steam boiler, which cannot be used without danger to life and limb. Every hoist and fly-wheel directly connected with mechanical power, and every part of a water-wheel or engine worked by mechanical power, and every wheel race, must be fenced, whatever its position, and every part of mill-gearing or dangerous machinery must either be fenced or be in such position that it is as safe as if fenced. No protected persons may clean any part of mill-gearing in motion, and children may further not clean any part of or below manufacturing machinery in motion by aid of mechanical power; young persons further may not clean any machinery if the inspector notifies it to the occupier as dangerous. Security as regards the use of dangerous premises is provided for by empowering courts of summary jurisdiction, on the application of an inspector, to prohibit their use until the danger has been removed. The district council, or, in London, the county council, or in case of their default the factory inspector, can require certain provisions for escape in case of fire in factories and workshops in which more than forty persons are employed; special powers to make by-laws for means of escape from fire in any factory or workshop are, in addition to any powers for prevention of fire that they possess, given to every district council, in London to the county council. The means of escape must be kept free from obstruction. Provisions are made for doors to open outwards in each room in which more than ten persons are employed, and to prevent the locking, bolting or fastening of doors so that they cannot easily be opened from inside when any person is employed or at meals inside the workplace. Further, provisions for security may be provided in special regulations. Every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop or place where the act applies must have a proper safety valve, a steam gauge, and a water gauge, and every such boiler, valve and gauge must be maintained in proper condition. Examination by a competent person must take place at least once in every fourteen months. The occupier of any factory or workshop may be liable for penal compensation not exceeding ¬£Ioo in case of injury or death due to neglect of any provision or special rule, the whole or any part of which may be applied for the benefit of the injured person or his family, as the secretary of state determines. When a death has occurred by accident in a factory or workshop, the coroner must advise the factory inspector for the district of the place and time of the inquest. The secretary of state may order a formal investigation of the circumstances of any accident as in the case of mines. Careful and detailed provisions are made for the reporting by occupiers to inspectors, and entry in the registers at factories and workshops of accidents which occur in a factory or workshop and (a) cause loss of life to a person employed there, or (b) are due to machinery moved by mechanical power, molten metal, hot liquid, explosion, escape of gas or steam, electricity, so disabling any person employed in the factory or workshop as to cause him to be absent throughout at least one whole day from his ordinary work, (c) are due to any other special cause which the secretary of state may determine, (d) not falling under the previous heads and yet cause disablement for more than seven days' ordinary work to any person working in the factory or workshop. In the case of (a) or (b) notice has also to be sent to the certifying surgeon by the occupier. Cases of lead, phosphorus, arsenical and mercurial poisoning, or anthrax, contracted in any factory or workshop must similarly be reported and registered by the occupier, and the duty of reporting these cases is also laid on medical practitioners under whose observation they come. The list of classes of poisoning can be extended by the secretary of state's order. Certificates of physical fitness for employment must be obtained by the occupier from the certifying surgeon for the district for all persons under sixteen years of age employed in a factory, and in any class of workshops to which the requirement has been extended by order of the secretary of state, and an inspector may suspend any such persons for re- examination in a factory, or for examination in a workshop, when \\" disease or bodily infirmity \\" unfits the person, in his opinion, for the work of the place. The certifying surgeon may examine the process as well as the person submitted, and may qualify the certificate he grants by conditions as to the work on which the person is fit to be employed. An occupier of a factory or workshop or laundry shall not knowingly allow a woman to be employed therein within four weeks after childbirth. Children and women The employment of children, young persons and women is regulated as regards ordinary and exceptional hours of work, ordinary and exceptional meal-times, length of spells and holidays. The outside limits of ordinary periods of employment and holidays are, broadly, the same for textile factories as for non-textile factories and workshops; the main difference lies in the requirement of not less than a total two hours' interval for meals out of the twelve, and a limit of four and a half hours for any spell of work, a longer weekly half holiday, and a prohibition of overtime, in textile factories, as compared with a total one and a half hours' interval for meals and a limit of five hours for spells and (conditional) permission of overtime in non-textile factories. The hours of work must be specified, and from Monday to Friday may be between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., or 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.; in non-textile factories and workshops the hours also may be taken between 8 A.M. and 8 P.M. or by order of the secretary of state for special industries 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Between these outside limits, with the proviso that mealtimes must be fixed and limits as to spells observed, women and young persons may be employed the full-time, children on the contrary only half time, on alternate days, or in alternate sets attending school half time regularly. On Saturdays, in textile factories in which the period commences at 6 A.M. all manufacturing work must cease at 12 if not less than one hour is given for meals, or I I.30 if less than one hour is given for meals (half an hour extra allowed for cleaning), and in non-textile factories and workshops at 2 P.M., 3 P.M. or 4 P.M., according as the hour of beginning is 6 A.M., 7 A.M. or 8 A.M. In \\" domestic workshops \\" the total number of hours for young persons and children must not exceed those allowed in ordinary workshops, but the outside limits for beginning and ending are wider; and the case is similar as regards hours of women in \\" women's workshops.\\" Employment outside a factory or workshop in the business of the same is limited in a manner similar to that laid down in the Shop Hours Act, to be touched on presently. Overtime in certain classes of factories, workshops and warehouses attached to them is permitted, under conditions specified in the acts, for women, to meet seasonal or unforeseen pressure of business, or where goods of a perishable nature are dealt with, for young persons only in a very limited degree in factories liable to stoppage for drought or flood, or for an unfinished process. These and other cases of exceptional working are under minute and careful administrative regulations. Broadly these same regulations as to exceptional overtime may apply in laundries but the act of 1907 granted to laundries not merely ancillary to the manufacture carried on in a factory or workshop (e.g. shirt and collar factories), additional power to fix different periods of employment for different days of the week, and to make use of one or other of two exceptional methods of arranging the daily periods so as to permit of periods of different length on different days; these exceptional periods cannot be worked in addition to overtime permissible under the general law. Laundries carried on in connexion with charitable or reformatory institutions were brought in 1907 within the scope of the law, but special schemes for regulation as to hours, meals, holidays, &c.;, may be submitted by the managers to the secretary of state, who is empowered to approve them if he is satisfied that they are not less favourable than the corresponding provisions of the principal act; such schemes shall be laid as soon as possible before both Houses of Parliament. Night work Night work is allowed in certain specified industries, under conditions, for male young persons, but for no other workers under eighteen, and overtime for women may never be later than 10 P.M. or before 6 A.M. Sunday work is prohibited except, under conditions, for Jews; and in factories, workshops and laundries six holidays (generally the bank holidays) must be allowed in the year. In creameries in which women and young persons are employed the secretary of state may by special order vary the beginning and end of the daily period of employment, and allow employment for not more than three hours on Sundays and holidays. Statutory instruments The general provisions of the act may be supplemented where specially dangerous or unhealthy trades are carried on, by special regulations. This was provided for in the law in force until 31 December 1901, as in the existing principal act, and the power to establish rules had been exercised between 1892 and 1901 in twenty two trades or processes where injury arose either from handling of dangerous substances, such as lead and lead compounds, phosphorus, arsenic or various chemicals, or where there is inhalation of irritant dust or noxious fumes, or where there is danger of explosion or infection of anthrax. Before the rule could be drawn up under the acts of 1891 to 1895, the secretary of state had to certify that in the particular case or class of cases in question (e.g. process or machinery), there was, in his opinion, danger to life or limb or risk of injury to health; thereupon the chief inspector might propose to the occupier of the factory or workshop such special rules or measures as he thought necessary to meet the circumstances. The occupier might object or propose modifications, but if he did not the rules became binding in twenty-one days; if he objected, and the secretary of state did not assent to any proposed modification, the matters in difference had to be referred to arbitration, the award in which finally settled the rules or requirement to be observed. In November 1901, in the case of the earthenware and china industry, the last arbitration of the kind was opened and was finally concluded in 1903. The parties to the arbitration were the chief inspector, on behalf of the secretary of state, and the occupier or occupiers, but the workmen interested might be and were represented on the arbitration. In the establishing of the twenty-two sets of existing special rules only thrice has arbitration been resorted to, and only on two of these occasions were workmen represented. The provisions as to the arbitration were laid down in the first schedule to the Act of 1891, and were similar to those under the Coal Mines Regulation Acts. Many of these codes have still the force of law and will continue until in due course revised under the amended procedure of the act of 1901. They might not only regulate conditions of employment, but also restrict or prohibit employment of any class of workers; where such restriction or prohibition affected adult workers the rules had to be laid for forty days before both Houses of Parliament before coming into operation. The obligation to observe the rules in detail lies on workers as well as on occupiers, and the section in the act of 1891 providing a penalty for non-observance was drafted, as in the case of the mines, so as to provide for a simultaneous fine for each (not exceeding two pounds for the worker, not exceeding ten pounds for the employer). The provisions as to special regulations of the act of 1901 touch primarily the method of procedure for making the regulations, but they also covered for the first time domestic workshops and added a power as to the kind of regulations that may be made; further, they strengthened the sanction for observance of any rules that may be established, by placing the occupier in the same general position as regards penalty for non-observance as in other matters under the act. On the certificate of the secretary of state that any manufacture, machinery, plant, process or manual labour used in factories or workshops is dangerous or injurious to life, health or limb, such regulations as appear to the secretary of state to meet the necessity of the case may be made by him after he has duly published notice: (1) of his intention; (2) of the place where copies of the draft regulations can be obtained; and (3) of the time during which objections to them can be made by persons affected. The secretary of state may modify the regulations to meet the objections made. If not, unless the objection is withdrawn or appears to him frivolous, he shall, before making the regulations, appoint a competent person to hold a public inquiry with regard to the draft regulations and to report to him thereon. The inquiry is to be made under such rules as the secretary of state may lay down, and when the regulations are made, they must be laid as soon as possible before parliament. Either House may annul these regulations or any of them, without prejudice to the power of the secretary of state to make new regulations. The regulations may apply to all factories or workshops in which the certified manufacture, process, &c.;, is used, or to a specified class. They may, among other things, (a) prohibit or limit employment of any person or class of persons; (b) prohibit, limit, or control use of any material or process; (c) modify or extend special regulations contained in the Act. Regulations have been established among others in the following trades and processes: felt hat- making where any inflammable solvent is used; file-cutting by hand; manufacture of electric accumulators; docks, processes of loading, unloading, &c.; tar distilling; factories in which self-acting mules are used; use of locomotives; spinning and weaving of flax, hemp and jute; manufacture of paints and colours; heading of yarn dyed by means of lead compounds. Wages and inspections Although the Factory and Workshop Acts have not directly regulated wages, they have made certain provision for securing to the worker that the amount agreed upon shall be received, :(a) by extending every act in force relating to the inspection of weights and measures and weighing machines for use in the sale of goods to those used in a factory or workshop for checking or ascertaining the wages of persons employed; :(b) by ensuring that piece-workers in the textile trades (and other trades specified by the secretary of state) shall receive, before commencing any piece of work, clear particulars of the wages applicable to the work to be done and of the work to which that rate is to be applied. Unless the particulars of work are ascertainable by an automatic indicator, they must be given to textile workers in writing, and in the case of weavers in the cotton, worsted and woollen trades the particulars of wages must be supplied separately to each worker, and also shown on a placard in a conspicuous position. In other textile processes, it is sufficient to furnish the particulars separately to each worker. The secretary of state has used his powers to extend this protection to non-textile workers, with suitable modifications, in various hardware industries, including pen-making, locks, chains, in wholesale tailoring and making of wearing apparel, in fustian cutting, umbrella-making, brush-making and a number of other piece-work trades. He further has in most of these and other trades used his power to extend this protection to outworkers. With a view to efficient administration of the act, :(a) certain notices have to be conspicuously exhibited at the factory or workshop, :(b) registers and lists kept, and :(c) notices sent Administo the inspector by the occupier. Among the first the most important are the prescribed abstract of the act, the names and addresses of the inspector and certifying surgeon, the period of employment, and specified meal-times (which may not be changed without fresh notice to the inspector), the air space and number of persons who may legally be employed in each room, and prescribed particulars of exceptional employment; among the second are the general registers of children and young persons employed, of accidents, of limewashing, of overtime, and lists of outworkers; among the third are the notice of beginning to occupy a factory or workshop, which the occupier must send within one month, report of overtime employment, notice of accident, poisoning or anthrax, and returns of persons employed, with such other particulars as may be prescribed. These must be sent to the chief inspector at intervals of not less than one and not more than three years, as may be directed by the secretary of state. The Secretary of State for the Home Department controls the administration of the acts, appoints the inspectors referred to in the acts, assigns to them their duties, and regulates the manner and cases in which they are to exercise the powers of inspectors. The act, however, expressly assigns certain duties and powers to a chief inspector and certain to district inspectors. Many provisions of the acts depend as to their operation on the making of orders by the secretary of state. These orders may impose special obligations on occupiers and increase the stringency of regulations, may apply exceptions as to employment, and may modify or relax regulations to meet special classes of circumstances. In certain cases, already indicated, his orders guide or determine the action of district councils, and, generally, in case of default by a council he may empower his inspectors to act as regards workplaces, instead of the council, both under the Factory Acts and Public Health Acts. The powers of an inspector are to enter, inspect and examine, by day or by night, at any reasonable time, any factory or workshop (or laundry, dock, &c.;), or part of one, when he has reason to believe that any person is employed there; to take with him a constable if he has reasonable cause to expect obstruction; to require production of registers, certificates, &c.;, under the acts; to examine, alone or in the presence of any other person, as he sees fit, every person in the factory or workshop, or in a school where the children employed are being educated; to prosecute, conduct or defend before a court of summary jurisdiction any proceeding under the acts; and to exercise such other powers as are necessary for carrying the act into effect. The inspector has also the duty of enforcing the Truck Acts in places, and in respect of persons, under the Factory Acts. Certifying surgeons are appointed by the chief inspector subject to the regulations of the secretary of state, and their chief duties are :(a) to examine workers under sixteen, and persons under special rules, as to physical fitness for the daily work during legal periods, with power to grant qualified certificates as to the work for which the young worker is fit, and :(b) to investigate and report on accidents and cases of lead, phosphorus or other poisoning and anthrax. In 1907 there were registered as under inspection 110,276 factories, including laundries with power, 146,917 workshops (other than men's workshops), including laundries without power; of works under special rules or regulations (included in the figures just given) there were 10,586 and 19,687 non-textile works under orders for supply of particulars to pieceworkers. Of notices of accidents received there were 124,325, of which 1179 were fatal; of reported cases of poisoning there were 653, of which 40 were fatal. Prosecutions were taken by inspectors in 4474 cases and convictions obtained in 4211 cases. Of persons employed there were, according to returns of occupiers in 1904, 4,165,791 in factories and 688,756 in workshops.

A garden square is a type of communal garden in an urban area wholly or substantially surrounded by buildings and, commonly, continues to be applied to public and private parks formed after such a garden becomes accessible to the public at large. The archetypal garden square is surrounded by tall terraced houses and other types of townhouse. It is subtly distinguished from a public-access version throughout the existence of the square - the town square. Due to its inherent private history it may have a pattern of dedicated footpaths and tends to have considerably more plants than hard surfaces and/or large monuments. Propagation At their conception in the early 17th century each such garden was a private communal amenity for the residents of the overlooking houses akin to a garden courtyard within a palace or community. Such community courtyards date back to at least Ur in 2000 BC where two-storey houses were built of fired brick around an open square. Kitchen, working, and public spaces were located on the ground floor, with private rooms located upstairs.Tim McNeese (1999), History of Civilization - The Ancient World, Lorenz Educational Press, p. 10 The conversion of many during the 20th century into public parks renders those garden squares a subset of town squares, that is those with a garden square heritage. Some remain private ‚Äì they may open intermittently or regularly ‚Äì but many today are open to the public at least during part of every day, serving as small parks. Occurrence =Europe= United Kingdom London is famous for them; they are described as one of the glories of the capital.\\"Court denies couple use of garden square\\", Martin Evans, The Daily Telegraph, 10 July 2010. Many were built or rebuilt during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, at the height of Georgian architecture, and are surrounded by elegant townhouses. Large projects, such as the Bedford Estate, included garden squares in their development. The Notting Hill and Bloomsbury neighbourhoods both have many garden squares, with the former mostly still restricted to residents, and the latter open to all. Other UK cities prominent in the Georgian era such as Edinburgh, Bath, Bristol and Leeds have several garden squares. Householders with access to a private garden square are commonly required to pay a maintenance levy.Council tax and garden square levies, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, UK. Normally the charge is set annually by a garden committee. Sometimes private garden squares are opened to the public, such as during Open Garden Squares Weekend.Open Garden Squares Weekend, London, UK. France =In Paris= Privately owned squares which survived the decades after the French Revolution and 19th century Haussmann's renovation of Paris include the Place des Vosges and Square des √âpinettes in Paris. It was a fashionable and expensive square to live in during the 17th and 18th centuries, and one of the central reasons that Le Marais district became so fashionable for French nobility. It was inaugurated in 1612 with a grand carrousel to celebrate the engagement of Louis XIII to Anne of Austria and is a prototype of the residential squares of European cities that were to come. What was new about the Place Royale as it was known in 1612 was that the house fronts were all built to the same design, probably by Baptiste du Cerceau. In town squares, similarly green but publicly accessible from the outset, is the Square Ren√© Viviani. Gardens substantially cover a few of the famous Places in the capital; instead the majority are paved and replete with profoundly hard materials such as Place de la Concorde. Inspired by ecological interests and a 21st-century focus on pollution mitigation, an increasing number of the Places in Paris today many have a focal tree, or surrounding raised flower beds/and or rows of trees such as the Place de la R√©publique. The enclosed garden terraces (French: jardins en terrain) and courtyards (French: cours) of some French former palaces have resulted in redevelopments into spaces equivalent to garden squares. The same former single-owner scenario applies to at least one garden square in London (Coleridge Square). =Outside of Paris= Grandiose instances of garden- use town squares are a part of many French cities, others opt for solid material town squares. =Belgium= The Square de Mee√ªs and Square Orban are notable examples in Brussels. =Ireland= Dublin has several Georgian examples, including Merrion Square, Fitzwilliam Square, Mountjoy Square, St Stephens Green and Parnell Square. =The Americas= United States Perhaps the most famous garden square in the United States is Gramercy Park in southern Midtown Manhattan. Famously, it has remained private and gated throughout its existence; possession of a key to the park is a jealously guarded privilege. The tradition of fee simple land ownership in American cities has made collective amenities such as garden squares comparatively rare. Very few subdividers and developers included them in plats during the 19th century, with notable exceptions below. Rittenhouse Square in the Center City, Philadelphia encases a public garden, one of the five original open- space parks planned by William Penn and his surveyor Thomas Holme during the late 17th century. It was first named Southwest Square. Nearby Fitler Square is a similar garden square named for late 19th century Philadelphia mayor Edwin Henry Fitler shortly after his death in 1896. The Square, cared for through a public private partnership between the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Fitler Square Improvement Association. In Boston tens of squares exist, some having a mainly residential use. The Kingstowne development in Fairfax County, Virginia, near Washington, DC, contains several townhouse complexes built around garden squares.

The novel is also one of the first of her books to be translated into English. Life Han Kang is the daughter of novelist Han Seung-won. She was born in Gwangju and at the age of 10, moved to Suyuri (of which she speaks affectionately in her novel Greek Lessons) in Seoul. She studied Korean literature at Yonsei University. Her brother Han Dong Rim is also a writer. She began her writing career when one of her poems was featured in the winter issue of the quarterly Literature and Society. She made her official literary debut in the following year when her short story \\"The Scarlet Anchor\\" was the winning entry in the daily Seoul Shinmun spring literary contest. Since then, she has gone on to win the Yi Sang Literary Prize (2005), Today's Young Artist Award, and the Korean Literature Novel Award. As of summer 2013, Han teaches creative writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts while writing stories and novels and is currently working on her sixth novel. Han has stated that she suffers from migraines, and credits these migraines with \\"keeping her humble.\\" Work Han's debut work, A Love of Yeosu, was published in 1995 and attracted attention because it was precisely and tightly narrated.Korean Writers: The Novelists, Minumsa Publishing p. 78 Han wrote The Vegetarian, and its sister-work, Mongolian Mark by hand, as overuse of the computer keyboard had damaged her wrist. It has been reported that in her college years Han became obsessed with a line of poetry from Yi Sang: \\"I believe that humans should be plants.\\" and that Han interpreted this to be a defensive stance against the violence of the colonial period and took this as an inspiration to write her most successful work, The Vegetarian. The Vegetarian was Han's first novel translated into English, though Han had already attracted worldwide attention by the time Deborah Smith translated the novel. There has been some controversy over the translation of the novel, as mistakes have been found. There is concern that Smith may have attributed some of the dialogue to the wrong characters. The translated work won the Man Booker International Prize 2016 for them both. She is the first Korean to be nominated for the award. The work was also chosen as one of \\"The 10 Best Books of 2016\\" from NYTimes Book Review. Han's third novel, The White Book, was shortlisted for the 2018 International Booker Prize. Han's literary career began when she published five poems including ‚ÄúWinter in Seoul\\", in the winter issue of Literature and Society in 1993. Her career in fiction began the following year when her work \\"Red Anchor\\" won the Seoul Shinmun Spring Literary Contest. Her first collection, Love of Yeosu, was published in 1995. In 1998, Han participated in a program at the University of Iowa International Writing Program. Her works published in Korea include Fruits of My Woman (2000) and Fire Salamander (2012); novels including The Black Deer (1998), Your Cold Hand (2002), The Vegetarian (2007), Breath Fighting (2010), Greek Lessons (2011), Human Acts (2014) and The White Book (2016); poetry I Put the Evening in the Drawer (2013); essay books including Love, and the Things Around the Love (2003), Quietly Sung Songs (2007). Han is also a musician and interested in art, and her work often reflects this. \\"Your Cold Hand (2002)\\" revolves around the story of a sculptor and his model. When she published an essay book Quietly Sung Songs (2007), she released a CD with ten songs that she composed, wrote lyrics for and recorded. At first she was not intending to sing, but Han Jung Rim, a musician and music director, insisted Han should record the songs herself. Han won the 25th Korean Novel Award with her novella Baby Buddha in 1999, the 2000 Today‚Äôs Young Artist Award, the 2005 Yi-Sang Literary Award with Mongolian Mark, and the 2010 Dong-ni Literary Award with Breath Fighting. Baby Buddha and The Vegetarian have been made into films. The Vegetarian was turned into a movie that was one of only 14 selections (out of 1,022 submissions) for inclusion in the World Narrative Competition of the prestigious North American Film Fest. The film was also a critical success at the Busan International Film Festival. Mongolian Mark won the Yi Sang Literary Award. The rest of the series (The Vegetarian and Fire Tree) were delayed by contractual problems. Han was the youngest to receive Yi Sang Literary Award in 2005 until 2013 when Kim Aeran received it at the age of 32. Her Human Acts was released in January 2016 from Portobello Books. Han has been chosen to win the Malaparte Prize 2017 with the Italian translation of Human Acts, \\"Atti Umani\\" from Adelphi Edizioni, 2017 in Italy on 1 October 2017. Han Kang's 2017 book, an autobiography called The White Book, centers on the loss of her older sister, a baby who died two hours after her birth.

Born and ordained in Ireland, Killian moved to Australia, where he became Bishop of Port Augusta before succeeding Robert Spence as Archbishop of Adelaide.  Early life  Andrew Killian was born on 26 October 1872 in Edenderry, County Offaly, Ireland. Son of Nicholas Killian and his wife Eliza Josephine, n√©e Ryan, Killian was educated at Mungret College, Limerick and St Patrick's College, Carlow. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Royal University of Ireland in 1894, and was ordained a Catholic priest on 4 June 1898. In late 1898, Killian came to Australia where his first appointment was as an assistant priest in Bourke, New South Wales. In 1907, he was transferred to Broken Hill where he demonstrated abilities as a parish administrator, clearing the debt of the parish, overseeing the construction of a school and eventually becoming Vicar General of the diocese. Killian was made a domestic prelate (monsignor) in 1919, and in 1924 was consecrated as bishop of Port Augusta,The Diocese of Port Augusta became the Diocese of Port Pirie in 1951. a position he held until 1933. During his time as Bishop of Port Augusta, Killian would travel over large distances to visit the scattered parishes of the rural diocese.  Archbishop of Adelaide  In July 1933, Killian was appointed as coadjutor archbishop of Adelaide where he assisted the ailing Robert Spence, and after Spence died on 5 November 1934, Killian became Archbishop of Adelaide. Killian's tenure as archbishop saw Adelaide host the National Catholic Education Congress in 1936, in part as a contribution to the celebrations of the South Australian colony's centenary. While Bishop of Port Augusta, Killian had attended Catholic conferences in Chicago and Dublin, and endeavoured to use the Congress to project South Australian Catholic enthusiasm and make a case for increased public funding of Catholic education. The event took place over one week in November 1936 and hosted bishops and archbishops from Australia and New Zealand, as well as the apostolic delegate to Australia Giovanni Panico. Leading Catholic educators presented papers, and the Congress concluded with a procession of 100,000 people along King William Street. When reflecting on his time as archbishop, Killian listed the conference as one of his proudest achievements, along with the re-opening of Mary MacKillop's school and convent in Penola. In the last year of his life, Killian suffered from cancer, and on 28 June 1939 he died while undergoing surgeryLaffin 2008, p 98. in St Vincent's Private Hospital Melbourne.

Career Born in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire, Benning started his youth career as an amateur in the nearby area, with Watford Schools, Luton Town and Croxley Boys Club. He also joined Watford as an amateur in July 1956. He became semi-professional a few months later, retaining a part-time job in the print industry. Competing with full- time professionals for a place in the team, he did not make a single appearance under Neil McBain, the manager who signed him. Benning had to wait until Ron Burgess's first game in charge on 14 February 1959 for his debut; a 3‚Äì2 defeat to York City at Vicarage Road. He retained his place for Watford's next two matches. Benning became a regular first-team player for Watford in 1959‚Äì60, missing the club's second league game of the season and their sole fixture in the Southern Floodlit Cup; only Cliff Holton played more matches. His first professional goal came on 12 September 1959 in a 6‚Äì0 win over Oldham Athletic. Watford finished the season in fourth position in the Football League Fourth Division, securing promotion to the Third Division. He was a regular in their first season in the division, as Watford again finished fourth. He faced increased competition in 1961‚Äì62, making only 18 of a possible 46 league appearances. In July 1962, Benning joined Cambridge City of the Southern League. In his first season, he helped City win the league over their rivals Cambridge United.

Coal mines The mode of progress to be recorded in the regulation of coal mines since 1872 can be contrasted in one aspect with the progress just recorded of factory legislation since 1878. Consolidation was again earlier adopted when large amendments were found necessary, with the result that by far the greater part of the law is to be found in the act of 1887, which repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, the Coal Mines Acts of 1872 and 1886, and the Stratified Ironstone Mines (Gunpowder) Act 1881. The act of 1881 was simply concerned with rules relating to the use of explosives underground. The act of 1886 dealt with three questions: (a) The election and payment of checkweighers (i.e. the persons appointed and paid by miners in pursuance of section 13 of the act of 1887 for the purpose of taking a correct account on their behalf of the weight of the mineral gotten by them, and for the correct determination of certain deductions for which they may be liable); (6) provision for new powers of the secretary of state to direct a formal investigation of any explosion or accident, and its causes and circumstances, a provision which was later adopted in the law relating to factories; (c) provision enabling any relatives of persons whose death may have been caused by explosions or accidents in or about mines to attend in person, or by agent, coroners' inquests thereon, and to examine witnesses. The act of 1887, which amended, strengthened and consolidated these acts and the earlier Consolidating Act of 1872, may also be contrasted in another aspect with the general acts of factory legislation. In scope it formed, as its principal forerunner had done, a general code; and in some measure it went farther in the way of consolidation than the Factory Acts had done, inasmuch as certain questions, which in factories are dealt with by statutes distinct from the Factory Acts, have been included in the Mines Regulation Acts, e.g. the prohibition of the payment of wages in public- houses, and the machinery relating to weights and measures whereby miners control their payment; further, partly from the less changing nature of the industry, but probably mainly from the power of expression gained for miners by their organisation, the code, so far as it went, at each stage answered apparently on the whole more nearly to the views and needs of the persons protected than the parallel law relating to factories. This was strikingly seen in the evidence before the Royal Commission on Labour in 1892-1894, where the repeated expression of satisfaction on the part of the miners with the provisions as distinct from the administration of the code (\\" with a few trifling exceptions \\") is in marked contrast with the long and varied series of claims and contentions put forward for amendment of the Factory Acts. Since the act of 1887, there have followed five minor acts, based on the recommendation of the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (\\" owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager \\") to make the removal of a particular checkweigher a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the district inspector of accidents under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines. While the classes of mines regulated by the act of 1887 are the same as those regulated by the act of 1872 (i.e. mines of coal, of Act of stratified ironstone, of shale and of fire-clay, including, works above ground where the minerals are prepared for 1887 use by screening, washing, &c.;) the interpretation of the term \\" mine \\" is wider and simpler, including \\" every shaft in the course of being sunk, and every level and inclined plane in the course of being driven, and all the shafts, levels, planes, works, tramways and sidings, both below ground and above ground, in and adjacent to and belonging to the mine.\\" Of the persons responsible under penalty for the observance of the acts the term \\" owner \\" is defined precisely as in the act of 1872, but the term \\" agent \\" is modified to mean \\" any person appointed as the representative of the owner in respect of any mine or any part thereof, and, as such, superior to a manager appointed in pursuance of this act.\\" Of the persons protected, the term \\" young person \\" disappeared from the act, and \\" boy,\\" i.e. \\" a male under the age of sixteen years,\\" and \\" girl,\\" i.e. \\" a female under the age of sixteen years,\\" take their place, and the term \\" woman \\" means, as before, \\" a female of the age of sixteen years and upwards.\\" The prohibition of employment underground of women and girls remains untouched, and the pro hibition of employment underground of boys has been successively extended from boys of the age of ten in 1872 to boys of twelve in 1887 and to boys of thirteen in 1900. The age of employment of boys and girls above ground in connexion with any mine is raised from ten years in 1872 to twelve years since 1887. The hours of employment of a boy below ground may not exceed fifty-four in any one week, nor ten in any one day from the time of leaving the surface to the time of returning to the surface. Above ground any boy or girl under thirteen (and over twelve) may not be employed on more than six days in any one week; if employed on more than three days in one week, the daily total must not exceed six hours, or in any other case ten hours. Protected persons above thirteen are limited to the same daily and weekly total of hours as boys below ground, but there are further provisions with regard to intervals for meals and prohibiting employment for more than five hours without an interval of at least half an hour for a meal. Registers must be kept of all protected persons, whether employed above or below ground. Section 38 of the Public Health Act 1875, which requires separate and sufficient sanitary conveniences for persons of each sex, was first extended by the act of 1887 to the portions of mines above ground in which girls and women are employed; underground this matter is in metalliferous mines in Cornwall now provided for by special rules. Ventilation, the only other requirement in the acts that can be classed as sanitary, is provided for in every mine in the \\" general rules \\" which are aimed at securing safety of mines, and which, so far as ventilation is concerned, seek to dilute and render harmless noxious or inflammable gases. The provision which prohibits employment of any persons in mines not provided with at least two shafts is made much more stringent by the act of 1887 than in the previous code, by increasing the distance between the two shafts from 10 to 15 yds., and increasing the height of communications between them. Other provisions amended or strengthened are those relating to the following points: (a) Daily personal supervision of the mine by the certificated manager; (b) classes of certificates and constitution of board for granting certificates of competency; (c) plan of workings of any mine to be kept up to a date not more than three months previously at the office of the mine; (d) notice to be given to the inspector of the district by the owner, agent or manager, of accidents in or about any mine which cause loss of life or serious personal injury, or are caused by explosion of coal or coal dust or any explosive or electricity or any other special cause that the secretary of state specifies by order, and which causes any personal injury to any person employed in or about the mine; it is provided that the place where an explosion or accident occurs causing loss of life or serious personal injury shall be left for inspection for at least three days, unless this would tend to increase or continue a danger or impede working of the mine: this was new in the act of 1887; (e) notice to be given of opening and abandonment of any mine: this was extended to the opening or abandonment of any seam; (f) plan of an abandoned mine or seam to be sent within three months; (g) formal investigation of any explosion or accident by direction of the secretary of state: this provision, first introduced by the act of 1886, was modified in 1887 to admit the appointment by the secretary of state of \\" any competent person \\" to hold the investigation, whereas under the earlier section only an inspector could be appointed. The \\"general rules\\" for safety in mines have been strengthened in many ways since the act of 1872. Particular mention may be made of rule 4 of the act of 1887, relating to the inspection of conditions as to gas ventilation beyond appointed stations Gencrar at the entrance to the mine or different parts of the mine; this rule generally removed the earlier distinction between mines in which inflammable gas has been found within the preceding twelve months, and mines in which it has not been so found; of rules 8, 9, 10 and 11, relating to the construction, use, &c.;, of safety lamps, which are more detailed and stringent than rule 7 of the act of 1872, which they replaced; of rule 12, relating to the use of explosives below ground; of rule 24, which requires the appointment of a competent male person not less than twenty-two years of age for working the machinery for lowering and raising persons at the mine; of rule 34, which first required provision of ambulances or stretchers with splints and bandages at the mine ready for immediate use; of rule 38, which strengthened the provision for periodical inspection of the mine by practical miners on behalf of the workmen at their own cost. With reference to the last-cited rule, during 1898 a Prussian mining commission visited Great Britain, France and Belgium, to study and compare the various methods of inspection by working miners established in these three countries. They found that, so far as the method had been applied, it was most satisfactory in Great Britain, where the whole cost is borne by the workers' own organisations, and they attributed part of the decrease in number of accidents per thousand employed since 1872 to the inauguration of this system. The provisions as to the proposal, amendment and modification of \\" special rules,\\" last extended by the act of 1896, may be contrasted with those of the Factory Act. In the latter Special it is not until an industry or process has been scheduled p as dangerous or injurious by the secretary of state's order that occasion arises for the formation of special rules, and then the initiative rests with the Factory Department whereas in mines it is incumbent in every case on the owner, agent or manager to propose within three months of the commencement of any working, for the approval of the secretary of state, special rules best calculated to prevent dangerous accidents, and to provide for the safety, convenience and proper discipline of the persons employed in or about the mine. These rules may, if they relate to lights and lamps used in the mine, description of explosives, watering and damping of the mine, or prevention of accidents from inflammable gas or coal dust, supersede any general rule in the principal act. Apart from the initiation of the rules, the methods of establishing them, whether by agreement or by resort to arbitration of the parties (i.e. the mine owners and the secretary of state), are practically the same as under the Factory Act, but there is special provision in the Mines Acts for enabling the persons working in the mine to transmit objections to the proposed rules, in addition to their subsequent right to be represented on the arbitration, if any. Of the sections touching on wages questions, the prohibition of the payment of wages in public-houses remains unaltered, being re-enacted in 1887; the sections relating to payment by weight for amount of mineral gotten by persons employed, and for checkweighing the amount by a \\" checkweigher \\" stationed by the majority of workers at each place appointed for the weighing of the material, were revised, particularly as to the determination of deductions by the act of 1887, with a view to meeting some problems raised by decisions on cases under the act of 1872. The attempt seems not to have been wholly successful, the highest legal authorities having expressed conflicting opinions on the precise meaning of the terms \\" mineral contracted to be gotten.\\" The whole history of the development of this means of securing the fulfilment of wage contract to the workers may be compared with the history of the sections affording protection to piece-workers by particulars of work and wages in the textile trades since the Factory Act of 1891. As regards legal proceedings, the chief amendments of the act of 1872 are: the extension of the provision that the \\" owner, agent, Adminis- or manager \\" charged in respect of any contravention. by another person might be sworn and examined as an tratioa ordinary witness, to any person charged with any offence under the act. The result of the proceedings against workmen by the owner, agent or manager in respect of an offence under the act is to be reported within twenty-one days to the inspector of the district. The powers of inspectors were extended to cover an inquiry as to the care and treatment of horses and other animals in the mine, and as to the control, management or direction of the mine by the manager. The Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908 limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman was not to be below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance in the event of an accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term \\" workman \\" in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, onsetter, pump minder, fanman or furnace man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A registry must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office of checkweigher or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910. In 1905 the number of coal-mines reported on was 3126, and the number of persons employed below ground was 691,112 of whom 43,443 were under 16 years of age. Above ground 167,261 were employed, of whom 6154 were women and girls. The number of separate fatal accidents was 1006, causing the loss of 1205 lives. Of prosecutions by far the greater number were against workmen, numbering in coal and metalliferous mines 953; owners and managers were prosecuted in 72 cases, and convictions obtained in 43 cases. Quarries From 1878 until 1894 open quarries (as distinct from underground quarries regulated by the Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act) were regulated only by the Factory Acts so far as they then applied. It was laid down in section 93 of the act of 1878 (41 Vict. c. 16), that \\" any premises or place shall not be excluded from the definition of a factory or workshop by reason only that such premises, &c.;, are or is in the open air,\\" thereby overruling the decision in Kent v. Astley that quarries in which the work, as a whole, was carried on in the open air were not factories; in a schedule to the same act quarries were defined as \\" any place not being a mine in which persons work in getting slate, stone, coprolites or other minerals.\\" The Factory Act of 1891 made it possible to bring these places in part under \\" special rules \\" adapted to meet the special risks and dangers of the operations carried on in them, and by order of the secretary of state they were certified, December 1892, as dangerous, and thereby subject to special rules. Until then, as reported by one of the inspectors of factories, quarries had been placed under the Factory Acts without insertion of appropriate rules for their safe working, and many of them were \\" developed in a most dangerous manner without any regard for safety, but merely for economy,\\" and managers of many had \\" scarcely seen a quarry until they became managers.\\" In his report for 1892 it was recommended by the chief inspector of factories that quarries should be subject to the jurisdiction of the government inspectors of mines. At the same time currency was given, by the published reports of the evidence before the Royal Commission on Labour, to the wish of large numbers of quarrymen that open as well as underground quarries should come under more specialised government inspection. In 1893 a committee of experts, including inspectors of mines and of factories, was appointed by the Home Office to investigate the conditions of labour in open quarries, and in 1894 the Quarries Act brought every quarry, as defined in the Factory Act 1878, any part of which is more than 20 ft. deep, under certain of the provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts, and under the inspection of the inspectors appointed under those acts; further, it transferred the duty of enforcing the Factory and Workshop Acts, so far as they apply in quarries over 20 ft. deep, from the Factory to the Metalliferous Mines inspectors. The provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts 1872 and 1875, applied to quarries, are those relating to payment of wages in public-houses, notice of accidents to the inspector, appointment and powers of inspectors, arbitration, coroners' inquests, special rules, penalties, certain of the definitions, and the powers of the secretary of state finally to decide disputed questions whether places come within the application of the acts. For other matters, and in particular fencing of machinery and employment of women and young persons, the Factory Acts apply, with a proviso that nothing shall prevent the employment of young persons (boys) in three shifts for not more than eight hours each. In 1899 it was reported by the inspectors of mines that special rules for safety had been established in over 2000 quarries. In the reports for 1905 it was reported that the accounts of blasting accidents indicated that there was \\" still much laxity in observance of the Special rules, and that many irregular and dangerous practices are in vogue.\\" The absence or deficiency of external fencing to a quarry dangerous to the public has been since 1887 (50 & 51 Vict. c. 19) deemed a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily in the manner provided by the Public Health Act 1875. In 1905, 94,819 persons were employed, of whom 59,978 worked inside the actual pits or excavations, and 34,841 outside. Compared with 1900, there was a total increase of 924 in the number of persons employed. Fatal accidents resulted in 1900 in 127 deaths; compared with 1899 there was an increase of To in the number of deaths, and, as Professor Le Neve Foster pointed out, this exceeded the average death-rate of underground workers at mines under the Coal Mines Acts during the previous ten years, in spite of the quarrier \\" having nothing to fear from explosions of gas, underground fires or inundations.\\" He attributed the difference to a lax observance of precautions which might in time be remedied by stringent administration of the law. In 1905 there were 97 fatal accidents resulting in 99 deaths. In 1900 there were 92 prosecutions against owners or agents, with 67 convictions, and 13 prosecutions of workers, with 12 convictions, and in 1905 there were 45 prosecutions of owners or agents with 43 convictions and 9 prosecutions of workmen with 5 convictions. In 1883 a short act extended to all \\" workmen \\" who are manual labourers other than miners, with the exception of domestic or menial servants, the prohibition of payment of wages in public- houses, beer-shops and other places for the sale of spirituous or fermented liquor, laid down in the Coal. Mines Regulations and Metalliferous Mines Regulation Acts. The places covered by the prohibition include any office, garden or place belonging to or occupied with the places named, but the act does not apply to such wages as are paid by the resident, owner or occupier of the public house, beer-shop and other places included in the prohibition to any workman bona fide employed by him. The penalty for an offence against this act is one not exceeding to (compare the limit of 20 for the corresponding,offence under the Coal Mines Act), and all offences may be prosecuted and penalties recovered in England and Scotland under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The act does not apply to Ireland, and no special inspectorate is charged with the duty of enforcing its provisions.

They produced the range of agricultural equipment, skimmers, excavators, cranes and draglines that were renowned for high quality and long life, typically over 20 years. Many NCK machines continue to operate worldwide. History The company started as iron founders in 1794 and expanded in Victorian times to include coal and iron mining. They diversified into equipment manufacture and in 1947 the company started producing the American brands of Koehring excavators under the Newton Chambers Koehring name,Historical Construction Equipment Association (2010) accessed on 2 August 2010 from: http://archives.hcea.net/?p=core/search&creatorid;=365 and in 1958 they took over Ransomes & Rapier building excavators, drag-lines, port cranes and other construction equipment under the NCK-Rapier brand. With the decline in coal and the improvements in hydraulic machines, the company diversified into light fabrication. The company was taken over in 1972 by the holding company Central and Sheerwood. NCK later was sold to Robert Maxwell's media group as part of a wider deal, but Maxwell was not interested in cranes and NCK became inactive. Cliffe Holdings then bought the company, later Staffordshire Public Works bought the company in 1997 after it fell again into receivership.

While I Live is best remembered for its musical theme \\"The Dream of Olwen\\" composed by Charles Williams, reprised at intervals throughout the film, which became hugely popular in its time and is still regularly performed. The film itself became widely known as The Dream of Olwen. It was based on a play by Robert Bell, in which Sonia Dresdel also starred. Plot In Cornwall in 1922, young pianist and composer Olwen Trevelyan (Audrey Fildes) is struggling with the ending of a piano tone poem she is composing. Driven to complete the piece by her domineering elder sister Julia (Sonia Dresdel), Olwen becomes agitated and despondent, and one night sleepwalks to the edge of a cliff near their home. Julia follows her and shouts her name but Olwen, abruptly awakened, loses her balance and falls to her death on the rocks below. Julia is unable to come to terms with Olwen's death and the guilt of her own role in it, over the years becoming a reclusive, obsessive figure whose main raison d'√™tre is to keep Olwen's memory alive. Olwen's final composition gains her posthumous recognition, and each year on the anniversary of her death it is broadcast on the radio. On the 25th anniversary of Olwen's death, Julia is listening to the broadcast when she hears a frantic knocking at the door and opens it to admit an unknown young woman (Carol Raye), who immediately walks up to the piano and begins expertly playing along with the piece on the radio. The young woman claims to have lost her memory and to have no idea of who she is or how she came to chance upon the isolated house, yet she seems to have a familiarity with the surroundings and the history of the Trevelyan family. Struck by her physical resemblance to Olwen, Julia offers her refuge and, also seeing behavioural traits reminiscent of Olwen, becomes convinced that the woman is the reincarnation of her dead sister. A local faith healer, Nehemiah (Tom Walls), who also claims second sight, becomes involved and it seems increasingly as though history is repeating itself, culminating when the young woman too is found standing precariously on the edge of the cliff from which Olwen fell.

Cast * Nino Taranto as Orazio Babilia * Vivi Gioi as Pepita * Natalino Otto as Natalino * I 3 Bonos (Gianni Bonos, Luigi Bonos, Vittorio Bonos) as themselves * Nanda Primavera as first aunt * Maria Pia Arcangeli as second aunt * Piero Carnabuci as the theatre owner * Umberto Silvestri as the butler * Giuseppe Addobbati as the hotel receptionist (uncredited) Production =Pre-production= Tutta la citt√† canta was director Riccardo Freda's third film as a director. The film was influenced by Hollywood films with the idea of putting a \\"revue\\" film on which featured the period's major singers and film stars, similar to that of The Hollywood Revue of 1929. Among the people in the film included Nino Taranto, a Neapolitan stage and radio comedian, Natalino Otto, a jazz singer, and singer and actress Vivi Gioi, and the three Bono brothers: Gianni, Vittorio and Luigi who were comedians somewhat similar to the Marx Brothers. During the script writing period, Freda met the then cartoonist Federico Fellini who was 23 years old at the time. According to Freda, Fellini was introduced to him by Vittorio Metz and took part in the screenwriting process, which Freda described Fellini's contributions as being \\"scrippling on sheet after sheet of paper with a pen. Thos were neither suggestions nor notes; Federico just kept drawing, and he drew huge naked women, real giangtesses, I think paroxsymally fat women were one of his hidden obsessions. Then, probably rightly so, he disappeared.\\" Recording music for the film had to be done discreetly as by 1938 in Italy, Jazz was labeled as \\"Negroid music\\" an banished from the radio and American music was forbidden by 1940. When performing songs such as \\"Louisiana blues\\", guards were placed outside the recording studio to make sure Blackshirts would not catch them. =Filming= Shooting on the film began in 1943 at Pisorno studios in Tirrenia under the title 6 x 8 / 48, based on one of the musical numbers in the film. Within a few weeks, filming was cancelled due to the escalation of World War II in Italy. Production on the film only began again on in 1945. Much of the cast was unavailable at the timeand the Vivi Gioi had gained a significant amount of weight. Freda chose to simply replace actors with doubles and used quick cutting to hide the actors being different from the audience. Release The film's title was changed to Tutta la citt√† canta, a title that echos the film The Whole Town's Talking. It was distributed in Italy by Effebi and was released on 15 August 1945. The film had little success in Italy as jazz music was no longer a hot topic as it had become legal once again. Freda spoke negatively about the film, stating that it was \\"a terrible turnip of a film\\" and that \\"the attempt at jazz was amusing. It was a 'spaghetti musical\\" The film was restored by the Cineteca of Milan and shown as part of a retrospective on Italian comedy at the 67th Venice International Film Festival in 2010.

Described as both a thriller and a horror film, it is based on the BBC's science fiction television series Doomwatch which ran between 1970 and 1972. The screenplay was written by Clive Exton. In the United States it was released by Embassy Pictures with the alternative title Island of the Ghouls. In the film, the waters surrounding an island become contaminated by chemical dumping, and people who eat fish caught in those waters become deformed and violent. The film was made at Pinewood Studios and location shooting took place around Polkerris, Mevagissey and Polperro in Cornwall, as well as the London Heliport in Battersea. The sets were designed by the art director Colin Grimes. Plot An outsider visits a remote isolated village that has seemingly shunned the modern life. Doctor Del Shaw, an investigator from the British ecological watchdog group nicknamed Doomwatch, is sent to the island of Balfe, to file a report on the effects of a recent oil tanker spill. He becomes fascinated with the mysterious behavioural disorders of the locals who display rudeness and random aggression and a strange genetic prevalence of thick lips and sloping brows. Investigation shows that the villagers have been suffering over a prolonged period from hormonal disorders, which are being caused by leaking drums of growth stimulants that have been dumped offshore. The islanders have been eating contaminated fish and develop a disorder of excessive hormonal growth, which produces aggression and eventually madness, attributed to a form of acromegaly. Rather than seek help from the mainland they hide those who are deformed from any newcomers.

Designed by the architect Edward Blore, the Court is described by Pevsner as a \\"fantastic and enormous tower-bedecked house.\\" The Court's situation, on a hilltop facing Goodrich Castle, so offended the poet William Wordsworth that he wished \\"to blow away Sir Samuel Meyrick's impertinent structure and all the possessions it contained.\\" Meyrick built the Court to house his very significant collection of armour and antiquities, much of which subsequently passed to the British Museum and to the Wallace Collection. In the years following its construction, Meyrick's house and its collections became a notable element of the Wye Tour. Meyrick's son predeceased him and after Meyrick's death, the Court passed through a number of hands, housing pupils from Felsted School during the Second World War. When the school left, the building was stripped of its contents, furnishings and fixtures, and completely demolished in 1949‚Äì50. Today, apart from a small lodge and the stables, the only significant remainder is the Monmouth Gatehouse, which stands on the Monmouth to Ross-on-Wye Road. History The Monmouth Gate: The main surviving fragment of Goodrich Court Samuel Meyrick was an antiquarian with an interest in Welsh history who claimed, incorrectly, to be related to the Welsh prince Owain Gwynedd. Meyrick originally intended to buy and restore a genuine Marches castle as his ancestral home, but was unable to acquire one. He explored the possibility of buying Goodrich Castle after a visit in 1823; \\"the very thing to suit us, so exactly that it seems to have been made on purpose\\"; but was unable to complete negotiations. Instead he decided to build his own new castle alongside the ruined castle which he named Goodrich Court. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner called it a \\"fantastic and enormous castellated tower-bedecked house\\", whilst its siting, directly opposite the genuine Norman castle, a positioning which foreshadowed that of Peckforton Castle and Beeston Castle, caused William Wordsworth to condemn it as \\"impertinent\\". After Meyrick's death in 1848, Goodrich Court was bought by George Moffatt, a Liberal party Member of Parliament. The Moffatts extended the castle, including building new stables in the same style as the original property. During the Second World War the castle was used by Felsted School, which was evacuated from Essex to the area. The broadcaster Kenneth Kendall recalled life at the Court during the evacuation; \\"The house was furnished with amazing furniture and paintings (with) armour everywhere. I remember one boy got struck inside a Jacobean helmet and had to be rescued by the headmaster.\\" When the school relocated at the end of the war the court was stripped of its fittings in 1946 and demolished in 1949. The Monmouth Gate, on the road to Ross-on-Wye, is the only significant surviving remnant of the Court. The site of the building is now a nature reserve. Architecture Designed by the Gothic Revival architect Edward Blore to Meyrick's instructions, Goodrich Court was built of local red sandstone in the neo- gothic style, and although based on the Edwardian architecture seen at Goodrich Castle, to some it more resembled a French chateau. Enjoying a gatehouse, portcullis, battlements, a moat and towers, it was also noted for the Armoury, a large hall which contained Meyrick's famous collection of armour. Many of the details of the castle utilised the heraldic symbols of Alymer de Valence, a medieval lord at Goodrich Castle in the early 14th century. The Monmouth Gate, which remains intact, is described by Pevsner as of \\"red stone with round towers and machicoulis.\\" It is a Grade II listed building.

Elizabeth suspects that Professor Delacroix (Lloyd Bochner) is responsible, considering his eccentric and mildly sadistic behavior. Elizabeth bursts into his office, finding him in a deranged state with a gun in his hand. He fears something supernatural is stalking him, and he jumps through the window. After running for some time, he ends up mired in a swamp, where he is beaten with sticks by several students including Jody. Meanwhile, the otherwise popular Dr. Joseph Clampett (Roy Thinnes) reveals to Williams that he is responsible for all the murders. He orders the headmistress to evacuate the school. Elizabeth and Roberta are unaware of the evacuation. They discover the body of Delacroix, who has been brutally murdered. Elizabeth and Roberta turn to Williams for help, but she has gone insane. When they are unsuccessful in calling the police, Elizabeth and Roberta go to the cellar to find a gun. Instead, they find Clampett leading a Satanic cult. His followers (including Jody) believe that he is Satan incarnate, and Roberta reveals herself as his loyal servant. Elizabeth is able to escape when Clampett sets the school on fire, and she takes Williams with her. However, the other girls stay behind. The entire building is engulfed in flames. Clampett, who is actually supernatural, survives the fire and is shown outdoors, where he mysteriously disappears, leaving only a patch of charred grass where he stood.

NISAC Port Operations Simulator Flowchart of NISAC's Port Operations Simulator inputs The National Infrastructure Simulation Analysis Center, a program within the Department of Homeland Security, has developed a Port Operations Simulator, which is designed to model, simulate, and analyze the effects on port economic health as a result of potential shipping container and port security policies. There is also a companion program, the Economic Simulator, which analyzes the long-term economic impact of security policies in the port. The simulator was originally designed specifically for ports in Portland, Seattle, and Houston, but it can be modified to apply to other ports as well. The Houston adaptation has built-in scenarios, including loss of electric power, loss of telecommunications, labor disruptions, and major security threats. Users have the ability to direct controls in order to determine the best response and recovery plans to these types of scenarios. SimPort SimPort is a serious game simulation in which the users must plan and manage a port expansion called the Second Maasvlakte at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Each team in the game is given three laptops and each user is given a role from the options of General Director, Commercial Director, or Director of Infrastructure and Management. The game consists of four one-hour rounds: Round 1 consists of defining strategies and creating an allocation plan; the subsequent rounds each represent ten years of management of the site. The game is targeted primarily at actual Port of Rotterdam staff, but is considered applicable to others in training and education settings. According to the official website, the Port of Rotterdam has three aims in the use of this game: # Gain better insight into any unforeseen, undesirable and unintentional effects of one or more development strategies and design variations in the medium term (10‚Äì30 years) as a result of exogenous uncertainties (economic, market, technological) and due to strategic behavior of the parties involved. # Stimulate holistic and multidisciplinary thinking within the Port of Rotterdam on commercial and technical/infrastructural considerations, interests and choices. # Improve the results of negotiations with respect to contracts (customers) and equipment (infrastructure) in the port area.http://www.simport.eu/index.php See also * Simulation * Military simulation * Simulated reality * Serious game References Category:Ports and harbours Category:Simulation ","title":"Port operations simulator"},{"id":"28222439","text":"National Research Institute for Panchakarma (NRIP) at Cheruthuruthy in Thrissur district, is the only organisation in the public sector for research and development in Indian systems of medicine, especially Panchakarma related to ayurvedic system.

His father was the famous General Jo√£o Nepomuceno de Medeiros Mallet, and his grandfather was the French-born Marshal √âmile Mallet. He was also of Portuguese and Irish descent. From childhood, he had a strong affinity for literature. He also learned to speak English and French. After completing his primary studies, he moved to Rio de Janeiro in order to study medicine at the Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, but he would not finish the course, because his teacher, the Viscount of Saboia, threatened to expel him because of his Republican ideals. He then abandoned medicine to devote himself to literature and journalism. He then moved to S√£o Paulo, to study law at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S√£o Paulo, but finished his course in Recife, Pernambuco. There, when he was receiving his diploma, he refused to take an oath because of his Republican ideals. The situation was circumvented thanks to Joaquim Nabuco.

Background As the Bankura district and adjoining areas, forming a part of ancient Rarh, were inhabited from pre-historic times by Austroloid and Dravidian tribes who were subsequently assimilated with the people and culture of the Indo-Europeans or Aryans, who prevailed in northern India, cultural traces of all these groups are visible in Bankura district to the present day.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, (in Bengali), part I, 1976 edition, pp. 62-65, Prakash BhabanRay, Nihar Ranjan, Bangalir Itihas Adi Parba, (in Bengali), 1980 edition, pp. 276-281, Paschim Banga Niraksharata Durikaran Samiti Initially, there were two primary groups, the Nishadas (who were Proto-Australoid tribes) and Dasa-dasyus (related to Dravidians). Amongst the subgroups were Bagdi, Bauri, Jele, Hari, Dom, and others. Around three-fourths of the Santals living in West Bengal, live in the Rarh region. Many of these peoples were initially martial races and were great heroes at some point of history. It is not that they form a majority in the district or region but they are substantial in numbers and probably were comparatively more numerous as a proportion of the total population in earlier days. Over the ages these people have exerted tremendous influence in shaping the folk culture of the region.Ghosh, Binoy, pp. 328-331 The area was widely influenced by Jainism, Buddhism and Shaivite thinking prior to the conversion of Bir Hambir to Vaishnavism. There were traces of Vaishnavism even in earlier days but since Bir Hambir's conversion it became the dominant influence in the region. Thus various historical factors have shaped the culture of Bankura district.Ghosh, Binoy, pp. 331-342 Temples Shyam Ray Temple, Bishnupur. Bankura district is a land of temples. There are more historical temples in Bishnupur than in any other place in West Bengal. There are several aspects of temple art, architecture and construction that need to be considered.Ghosh, Binoy, pp. 337-346 Almost all temples in Bishnupur town are Vaishnavite, but many of those scattered in different areas of the district spread outside the town are Shaivite, with traces of Jainism and Buddhism. While some of the older temples were built of laterite the area has numerous brick built temples, some with exquisite terracotta carvings. Terracotta carvings are also found in some temples outside the district, as for example at Jaydev Kenduli or Antpur, but the art of terracotta carvings seems to have flourished with the rise of the Rajas of Bishnupur and virtually died out with the fading of their supremacy. Some of the earlier temples built by the Bardhaman Raj have terracotta carvings, possibly by artisans from Bankura district, but by the time Rani Rashmoni decided to construct the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, in the mid nineteenth century, the art of terracotta carvings had obviously faded out. While Bankura district has some fine examples of rekha deul temples built in what is popularly known as the Kalinga architecture of Orissa, as for example at Bahulara, but it is the Bengal style of architecture that attracts attention in the district. The Shyamrai temple built by Raghunath Singh in 1643 is perhaps the oldest pancharatna temple in Bengal. With curved roofs in thatched style, it has one deul in the centre and one in each corner. The Jor Bangla temple was built in 1655 also by Raghunath Singh. It is a fine example of the Bengal style of temple architecture. Gods and goddesses were thought of as being close to human beings and as such placed in temples that resembled human habitation, the hut with thatched roof. Four distinct types of temples may be distinguished in Bishnupur. The first has a single square on a curved roof and is represented by Malleswar temple. The second has a single tower on a curved roof. The best examples of this are Madan Mohan temple in brick and in laterite Lalji and Radha Shyam temples. The pancharatna temple has five towers on a curved roof. The best examples are Shyam Rai temple in brick and Madan Gopal temple in laterite. The fourth type is the Jor Bangla type with two buildings shaped like a typical Bengal hut joined together with a small tower on top. It is the most interesting one from the architectural point of view. The Shyam Rai temple has the finest specimens of carved tiles.O‚ÄôMalley, L.S.S., ICS, Bankura, Bengal District Gazetteers, pp. 183-191, 1995 reprint, first published 1908, Government of West Bengal It needs to be mentioned that the powerful Rajas of Bishnupur had a non-descript single storied palace, not even comparable to the Rajbaris of many a somewhat ordinary zamindar in Bengal. Even the fort at Bishnupur seems to have been constructed for the protection of temples. Fort and Rasmancha Rasmancha The fort has a high earthen wall and a moat around it. The approach is through the Pathar Darja, a large laterite gateway with arrow slits. In the western part of the fort is a building with four solid walls and no entrance except from top. It has no roof. It is believed to have been a dungeon where criminals were thrown in. There are a number of cannons, including the famous Dalmardan (commonly pronounced Dalmadal). The Rasmancha consists of a square chamber surrounded on each side by three galleries with ten, eight and five arched openings respectively, covered by a pyramidal roof. It was earlier used for putting up idols during the Ras festival. Handicrafts Bankura horses Bankura district produces a number of terracotta handicrafts, the most popular being the Bankura horse. It has been praised for \\"its elegant stance and unique abstraction of basic values\\". Originally used for village rituals, it now adorns drawing rooms across the world as symbols of Indian folk-art. It is the logo of All India Handicrafts. The principal centres where the terracotta horses and elephants are produced are Panchmura, Rajagram, Sonamukhi and Hamirpur. Each place has its local style. The Panchmura-style of pottery is considered the best and the finest of all the four types. Another popular product is the manasachali. The potters of Sonamukhi and Panchmura turn out thousands of manasachali for worshipping Manasa or the snake goddess. Among other forms of handicrafts prevalent in Bankura are: dhokra, wood carving, conch-shell, stone carving, bamboo craft, bell metal, bel mala, dasabatar playing cards, and lanterns. Handloom textiles One of the most expensive saris in India, called the Baluchari Saris, are created by craftsmen of Bishnupur. When, with the advent of the British, the Baluchari started declining in Murshidadabad, its original home, Subho Tagore, painter, art- collector and nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, invited Akshay Kumar Das, a master weaver of Bishnupur to learn the intricacies of jacquard weaving. The latter infused the Baluchari into the rich traditions of silk weaving at Bishnupur. The silk strands are dyed separately and then put into a loom. Designs are woven with the help of a series of punch cards that are hung from the top of the loom. Mythological stories that formed the wall sculpture in many a temple in Bishnupur, found their way on to the body of the sari. One sari may have an entire episode from the Mahabharata woven into its border and pallu. Apart from Baluchari and Swarnachuri saris, which are often produced with tussar silk, the main cotton products of Bankura district are bed sheets, bed covers, gamchha, towels, window and door curtains, kachha dhuti and saris of coarser variety. Fairs and festivals Dharma worship in a Bankura village. The fairs of Bankura are often organised in consonance with religious festivities. Examples of such fairs and festivities are Choitro Gajan of Ekteswar and Dharmarajer Gajan of Beliatore. The major Hindu festivals such as Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Lakshmi Puja and Saraswati Puja are celebrated with pomp and grandeur. Major festivals of other religions, such as Eid al-Adha, Eid ul-Fitr, Vaisakhi, Budha Purnima, and Christmas are also celebrated. Other important fairs and festivals are ‚Äì Ras Utsab of Bishnupur, Kaliyadaman of Jagadallah and Purandarpur, Pirer Utsab of Indas, Basuli Mela of Chhatna and Dhara Utsab of Susunia. Bhadu Puja and Tusu Puja find wide participation of women. Jhapan festival, dedicated to the snake goddess Manasa, is observed on the last day of Srabon in the western fringe of the state with a high concentration of tribal population. Idols of Manasa, specially made for the occasion, are carried round the village. The day is also of great significance for snake charmers in the region with some kissing their snakes. Bishnupur Mela is being organised by the state government from 23 to 27 December from 1988, near the Madanmohana Temple. About 3-400,000 people visit the mela. Besides display and sale of handicraft items, cultural programmes including folk songs, are organized on three stages simultaneously, portraying the rich cultural heritage of this part of Rarh Bhumi. Bankura Book Fair is organised in December every year. See also - Bankura Book Fair 2008 pictures See also - Bishnupur Fair 2008 pictures Music The Bishnupur Gharana follows the Dhrupad tradition of Hindustani classical music. The gharana originated amongst the court musicians of the Rajas of Bishnupur, around the 14th century. It is said to be the only gharana developed exclusively in West Bengal. During the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb, the oppressive environment in field of art and culture, lead many musicians to the court at Bishnupur. Amongst them was the famous Dhrupad vocalist and dextrous instrumentalist Bahadur Khan, who was welcomed by Raghunath Singh Deo II and honoured as a court musician. Historical evidence points to Pt. Ramachandra Bhattacharya, a disciple of Ud. Bahadur Khan, as the founder of the Bishnupur Gharana. In the later part of the eighteenth century and towards the early and mid-nineteenth century, when music of different gharanas was gradually veering around the Khyal style Indian classical music, the Dhrupad style continued flourishing in Bishnupur. It is simple, and devoid of heavy and complicated ornamentation. It has developed its own style with regard to rhythm. A number of musicians played a role in the evolution and development of the gharana, namely Gadadhar Chakraborty, Krishna Mohan Goswami, Ram Sankar Bhattacharya and his son Ram Keshab Bhattacharya. They were some of the early exponents. Then appeared Jadu Bhatta (Jadunath Bhattacharya), who raised this music to a higher level and made it well known throughout India. Dinabandhu Goswami, Ananta Lal Bandyopadhyay. Rama Prasanna Bandyopadhyay, Radhika Prasad Goswami, Gopeshwar Bandyopadhyay, Surendranath Bandyopadhyay were the next generation musicians, all of whom were great exponents of Bishnupur Gharana. The disciples of Rama Prasanna Bandyopadhyay, Gokul Nag (sitar) and Asesh Chandra Bandyopadhyay (esraj) carried the reputation of Bishnupur Gharana to a higher standard. Bankura do known for its Rock music love, Events like Rock Fest 2011-2013, Valentine Fever 1-4(2014-2017, Project Agomoni 2014-2017, Noise Reduction 2017 & many more are there.

Located in a building dating to the late 18th century, it is the oldest known property to have regularly had summer boarders, with a documented history of doing so dating to 1840. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Old Orchard Beach Inn is prominently located in the center of Old Orchard Beach, on the west side of Portland Avenue (Maine State Route 8), opposite the town hall. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with two large blocks, that on the left offset to the rear. Both have side gable roofs and are finished in clapboard siding. The right block has a hip-roofed porch extending across its width, and both sections have gabled dormers projecting from the roof. The right block's interior includes 18th-century features such as a narrow winding staircase, low ceiling, and fireplace mantel. The house's oldest portion was built sometime in the 18th century, possibly as early as 1730. Initially a one-story farmhouse, it was bought by Elisha Staples in 1790 and enlarged by raising the roof. About 1840 his grandson Ebenezer began taking on summer visitors, who began arriving in the area in larger numbers after railroad access to the area increased in the 1840s and 1850s. By the 1870s, the establishment was one of the largest in Old Orchard Beach, with 300 beds. Much of the complex, remarkably sparing the original farmhouse, was destroyed by fire in 1875. A new, larger hotel was built adjacent, that was demolished in the 20th century. The exterior of the surviving house, now the Old Orchard Beach Inn, is much as it might have appeared late in the 19th century, and its upstairs rooms appear as they might have been in the mid-19th century.

M√°niƒçka (in plural: M√°niƒçky) is a Czech term used for young people with long hair, typically men, in Czechoslovakia through the 1960s and 1970s. Long hair for males during this time was considered an expression of political and social attitudes in communist Czechoslovakia.  Background  Long hair was associated with the subcultures and youth movements that arose in the Western world during the mid-1960s, such as Hippies and rock music. Following the February coup d'√©tat of 1948, the new communist r√©gime condemned some elements of the Western culture as an inherently decadent imperialist \\"import\\" into the socialist world. At first, communists persecuted sympathizers of rock 'n' roll and bebop, and later they focused on supporters of rock music. Their methods were compared with the campaigns of Nazi r√©gime against the supporters of jazz and swing during the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The term \\"m√°niƒçky\\" is also generally associated with the generation gap that increased around the world during the 1960s. Male long hair in the Czechoslovak society of the 1960s and 1970s was partially regarded as a matter of image and style, but the main reason for having long hair was usually different. The young people attempted to express openly their political attitude, independence, freedom and protest. However, the revolt symbolized by extravagant appearance was not tolerated by communists and young rebels were often forced to cut their hair. From the mid-1960s, \\"m√°niƒçky\\" became a target of continuous interest of the state security apparatus.Pokorn√° (2010) The activities of the alternative youth culture were not only and primarily political; therefore it was difficult for communists to grasp their intentions. A large number of young people attempting to live outside of the influence and control of the state was disturbing for the regime, as these people represented a potential danger for the communist system. Through the coordinated pressure of various levels of the state administration, the totalitarian power attempted to force young people to change their appearance, or to displace from the public sphere people who were not \\"socially acceptable\\".  Persecution  From the mid-1960s, the long-haired and \\"untidy\\" persons (so called \\"m√°niƒçky\\" or \\"vlasatci\\" (in English: Mops)) were banned from entering pubs, cinema halls, theatres and using public transportation in several Czech cities and towns. In 1964, the public transportation regulations in Most and Litv√≠nov excluded long-haired \\"m√°niƒçky\\" as displeasure-evoking persons. Two years later, the municipal council in Podƒõbrady banned \\"m√°niƒçky\\" from entering cultural institutions in the town. In August 1966, Rud√© pr√°vo informed that \\"m√°niƒçky\\" in Prague were banned from visiting restaurants of the I. and II. price category. In 1966, during a big campaign coordinated by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, around 4,000 young males were forced to cut their hair, often in the cells with the assistance of the state police. On 19 August 1966, during a \\"safety intervention\\" organized by the state police, 140 long-haired people were arrested. As a response, the \\"community of long-haired\\" organized a protest in Prague. More than 100 people cheered slogans such as \\"Give us back our hair!\\" or \\"Away with hairdressers!\\". The state police arrested the organizers and several participants of the meeting. Some of them were given prison sentences. According to the newspaper Mlad√° fronta Dnes, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior in 1966 even compiled a detailed map of the frequency of occurrence of long-haired males in Czechoslovakia. The Plastic People of the Universe, veterans of the Czech cultural underground scene. Their performances were regularly visited by the long-haired \\"m√°niƒçky\\" in the 1960s and 1970s. In August, 1969, during the first anniversary of the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, the long-haired youth were one of the most active voices in the state protesting against the occupation. Youth protesters have been labeled as \\"vagabonds\\" and \\"slackers\\" by the official normalized press. The discriminatory campaign against long-haired males called \\"M√°≈°-li dlouh√Ω vlas, nechoƒè mezi n√°s!\\" (If you have long hair, do not walk among us!) was supported by the state television, and major newspapers and magazines. The campaign consisted of a series of TV spots showing detection and conviction of a long-haired person in a public place. Each spot ended with the trademark slogan: \\"If you have long hair, do not walk among us!\\" Similarly, an episode of the popular propagandistic TV series Thirty Cases of Major Zeman showed \\"m√°niƒçky\\" as a harmful, criminal and drug-using social element. Long-haired and intoxicated individuals in the episode called \\"Mimikry\\" (Mimicry, 1972) smuggle drugs with suspicious dealers from the Western imperialist world, they cause the death of a girl, and finally they attempt to flee to the West with a hijacked plane. The performances of the Czech underground bands The Plastic People of the Universe and DG 307 were regularly visited by the long-haired \\"m√°niƒçky\\". In 1974, a concert of The Plastic People of the Universe in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice was broken up by police. The participants were brought to hearings and trials and forced to cut their hair. Many of them were harassed and some of them were fired from their jobs. In 1976, during a politicized trial with the members of the Plastic People, m√°niƒçky publicly supported the accused artists. The repression against long-haired people by the socialist system continued up to 1989, though in a moderate form. The Velvet Revolution and subsequent transformation of the Czechoslovak society into a democratic system caused significant changes, and long hair as a manifestation of defiance has gradually lost the previous meaning of a \\"protest\\" act. \\"M√°niƒçky\\" have been supported by numerous personalities of the public life in Czechoslovakia: former Czech President V√°clav Havel, poet Ivan Martin Jirous, musician Milan Hlavsa and politician Alexandr Vondra among others.

History The church probably originated in the 12th century, and later served as the village school. However, by the 1840s it was a ruin. It was rebuilt in 1926‚Äì27 from the ruins, and was designed by the architect John Coates Carter. The design followed Arts and Crafts principles, that is, to use the simplest available local materials, without attempting to copy the style of any particular period. After the church was closed in 2002, it was taken into the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. Architecture =Exterior= St Teilo's is constructed in stone rubble with a slate roof.

Biography Rottenberg came from a German-speaking Jewish family in Czernowitz, the then-capital of Bukovina, which at the time was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy. He studied music in his birthplace, and later at the Vienna Conservatory. During his studies he conducted an amateur orchestra and worked as a Lieder accompanist. He started his professional conducting career at the Brno opera house. In 1892 he succeeded Felix Dessoff as Erster Kapellmeister at the Frankfurt Opera. He was recommended for the position by Johannes Brahms and Hans von B√ºlow, being preferred to two other famous applicants, Richard Strauss and Felix Mottl. He held this position until 1926. During his tenure he worked with six different artistic directors, and helped establish the Frankfurt Opera as one of the leading opera houses of its time. Numerous contemporary operas were staged there during this period, among others the world premiere performances of Der ferne Klang (1912), Die Gezeichneten (1918) and Der Schatzgr√§ber (1920) by Franz Schreker. Other important performances, partly German premieres, included Hans Pfitzner's Der arme Heinrich (1897), Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1907), Richard Strauss‚Äô Elektra (1909) and further operas by Ferruccio Busoni, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek, B√©la Bart√≥k and Paul Hindemith.

His father Bruce Rothwell was a prominent journalist, and the family resided in Australia, Washington DC, and New York among other places. Rothwell attended boarding school in Switzerland and France, and graduated from the University of Oxford. In the 1980s and early 1990s he was a foreign correspondent for The Australian and reported from the Americas, the Pacific and Western and Eastern Europe, latterly during the Yugoslav conflict.

Born in Ireland, Spence became a Dominican priest, and after serving as a prior in Kilkenny, moved to Adelaide, Australia in 1898. In 1915, he became Archbishop of Adelaide, a position he held until his death in 1934. Early life Robert Spence was born on 13 January 1860 in Cork, Ireland. The son of Robert Spence and his wife Ellen, n√©e Sullivan, he received his education from the Christian Brothers and Vincentian Fathers before entering the Dominican novitiate in Tallaght, outside Dublin. Having professed in 1878, Spence moved to Lisbon, where he studied for the priesthood at Corpo Santo College. He was ordained a priest on 23 December 1882, and two days later, at Bom Sucesso convent he celebrated the first Dominican high mass in Portugal since religious orders were suppressed there in 1833. Returning to Ireland in 1885, he served in Cork and Newry, and ran retreats throughout Ireland, earning a reputation as a zealous and forceful preacher. In 1892, he became prior of the Black Abbey priory in Kilkenny, a position he held for six years. In 1898, Spence travelled to Adelaide, Australia as prior of the first Dominican house of friars in Australia until 1901. Spence constructed a priory at St Laurence's Church in North Adelaide, and ran retreats ministering to religious. In 1899, he founded the Adelaide Catholic Club (intended as a Catholic version of the Adelaide Club), and throughout his time in Adelaide he continued to participate in Catholic associations, serving as president of the state branch of the Australian Catholic Federation and reviving the North Adelaide branch of the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society. While serving as a prior in North Adelaide from 1908, Spence became more involved in the administration of the Archdiocese, advising then Archbishop John O'Reily, and often accompanying him when the Archbishop travelled.Press 1991, p 155.  Episcopacy  By the 1910s, Archbishop O'Reily was growing frail, with many of his pastoral duties having to be filled by Bishop of Port Augusta John Norton,.Press 1991, p 74. In 1913, O'Reily requested a coadjutor, indicating his preference for Spence to be appointed. Despite some Australian bishops raising objections to a religious becoming a bishop, Spence was appointed coadjutor archbishop on 13 July 1914. He was consecrated on 16 August of the same year, and when O'Reily died on 6 July 1915, Spence became Archbishop. While Archbishop, Spence continued to wear the plain clothes of his Dominican order rather than the purple soutane of an archbishop. He carried on O'Reily's efforts to restructure the diocesan finances, removing much of the diocese debt. After returning from an ad limina visit to Rome in 1921, he travelled through the archdiocese to raise funds for the completion and transformation of St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, with the new building opened in 1926. While in Ireland in 1920, Spence gave a controversial speech in Newry where he saluted the Irish flag and alleged that \\"soldiers of the British Government were committing atrocities in Ireland.\\" The incident was controversial in Australia, with Adelaide newspapers accusing him of disloyalty.Press 1991, p 89. In July 1933, in the same month as he was made a count of the Holy Roman Empire, an assistant at the pontifical throne and a companion to Pius XI, Andrew Killian was appointed to serve as Spence's coadjutor. Spence died in Adelaide on 5 November 1934, with the Adelaide City Council adjourning as a sign of respect for the late Archbishop.

The resolution, drafted by the United Kingdom, was adopted during a rise in attacks on United Nations peacekeepers and civilians, including ambushes and the holding of a UNAMID helicopter pilot by local groups. The Council also heard that fighting between rebel groups and the government had intensified. The following day after the adoption of Resolution 1935, the Sudanese government requested UNAMID peacekeepers to inform it of its movements, after accusing the United Nations of failing to keep the peace at refugee camps in the west of the country. Resolution =Observations= The Security Council expressed its support to the political process in the Darfur region of Sudan and welcomed dialogue between the Sudanese government and Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM), deploring that some groups refused to join the political process. It underlined co-operation between the United Nations and African Union consistent with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, and the need for a rigorous, strategic approach to peacekeeping deployments in order to improve their effectiveness. Meanwhile, there was concern at the deterioration of the security situation in Darfur through violations of the ceasefire, rebel attacks, intertribal fighting, aerial bombardment by the Sudanese government and attacks on humanitarian personnel. Furthermore, all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur were condemned by the Council, while the resumption of diplomatic relations between Sudan and Chad on January 15, 2010 was welcomed. =Acts= Extending UNAMID's mandate for a year, the Council urged the operation to make the full use of its mandate to protect civilians and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. It urged for the promotion of the African Union-United Nations led political process in Darfur. All attacks on and threats against UNAMID were strongly condemned as unacceptable and the Council demanded that such incidents cease immediately. Additionally, there was concern at restrictions placed on UNAMID's freedom of movement and operations, and the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was required to report every 90 days on the implementation of its mandate. The resolution demanded that all parties to the conflict end violence, attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel immediately and comply with international obligations relating to human rights and humanitarian law. In this regard, a more effective ceasefire monitoring mechanism was suggested. The Council was seriously concerned at the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and threats to humanitarian organisations. It reiterated that there would be no military solution to the Darfur conflict and that a political settlement was essential; all parties, including rebel groups, were urged to participate in the process. The Security Council noted that the conflict in Darfur had consequences on the rest of Sudan and the wider region, and UNAMID was urged to co-operate with the United Nations Mission in Sudan and United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad. The operation was also asked to assist in preparations for the independence referendum in Southern Sudan. The Council further stressed solutions to the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons and recovery initiatives. It was concerned at continuing localised conflicts and the proliferation of weapons, demanding that all parties to the conflict take measures to protect civilians. Finally, the Secretary-General was called upon to ensure continuing dialogue and reporting on the situation of children in the conflict, including the use of child soldiers and violations of human rights.

Companies are also often called issuers (issuing or contemplating issuing shares), filers (entities that must file reports with the SEC) or registrants (entities that must register (usually shares) with the SEC). Regulation S-K is generally focused on qualitative descriptions while the related Regulation S-X focuses on financial statements. Applicability In a company's history, Regulation S-K first applies with the Form S-1 that companies use to register their securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the \\"registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933\\". Thereafter, Regulation S-K applies to the ongoing reporting requirements in documents such as forms 10-K and 8-K. Regulation S-K applies to: * registration statements under the Securities Act to the extent provided in the forms to be used for registration under that Act; * registration statements under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, also known as subpart C of part 249 of this chapter (17 CFR Part 229); * annual or other reports under sections 13 and 15(d); * going-private transaction statements under section 13; * tender offer statements under sections 13 and 14; * annual reports to security holders and proxy and information statements under section 14; and * any other documents required to be filed under the Exchange Act, to the extent provided in the forms and rules under that Act. A public company is initially impacted by Regulation S-K with its IPO (initial public offering of shares). Form S-1 contains the basic business and financial information on an issuer with respect to a specific securities offering. Investors may use the prospectus to consider the merits of an offering and make educated investment decisions. A prospectus is one of the main documents used by an investor to research a company prior to an initial public offering. Form S-1 has an OMB approval number of 3235‚Äì0065 and the online form is only 8 pages. However, the simplicity of the form's design is belied by the OMB Office's figure of the estimated average burden ‚Äì 972 hours. Regulation S-K (the \\"K\\" can be thought of as a reporting classification as for Form 10-K) cannot be considered in a vacuum, and indeed all the securities regulations and associated law may form a very large body of information. Professionals in the field of securities compliance reporting will need to be aware of other rules and regulations as noted at the Division of Corporation Finance. Rules, regulations, and schedules commonly associated with Regulation S-K * Regulation S-X [17 CFR Part 210]: Form and content of and requirements for financial statements * Regulation M-A [17 CFR 229.1000 ‚Äì 229.1016]: Mergers and acquisitions * Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1100 ‚Äì 229.1123]: Asset-backed securities * Industry Guides: Securities Act and Exchange Act Industry Guides * General Rules and Regulations from the Securities Act of 1933 [17 CFR Part 230] * Rule 144 [17 CFR 230.144]: Defines persons legally deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not treated as underwriters * Regulation C [17 CFR 230.401 ‚Äì 230.498]: Registration and filing requirements * Regulation D [17 CFR 230.501 ‚Äì 230.508]: Rules for limited offer and sale of securities without registration * Regulation S [17 CFR 230.901 ‚Äì 230.905]: Rules governing offers and sales made outside the United States Regulation S-K: Highlights by item =Item 10: General= Item 10 suggests management make reasonable projections for the future. Security ratings are voluntarily permitted for classes of debt securities, convertible debt securities, and preferred stock. Incorporation by reference is defined; no piggy-back referencing (no reference to a reference in another filed document) is allowed. Non-GAAP financial measures are discouraged. Smaller companies are allowed to only fill in items 101, 201, 301, 302, 303, 305, 402, 404, 407, 503, 504, and 601. =Business= Item 101: Description of Business The initial portion of this information is relatively simple ‚Äì e.g., incorporation and address ‚Äì but item 101 then asks for how the company is doing in its various industry segments and a thorough description of both the company's current business and how it intends to do business in future. These requirements have been criticized for their potential assistance to the company's competitors. Some requirements for reports to shareholders are also stated. Item 102: Description of Property This section requires disclosure of information on physical property, such as land, buildings such as plants, mines, oil, and gas reserves; this requirement has likewise been criticized, by some commenters to the December 12, 2007 concept releasehttp://www.sullcrom.com/siteFiles/Publications/SC_Publication_Oil_and_Gas_Reserves_Disclosure_42C1.pdf for potentially assisting a company's competitors. Industry Guides sometimes indicate what must be disclosed. Item 103: Legal Proceedings This section requires disclosure of any material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, such as lawsuits against an insurance company's customers) to which the registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject; this especially includes \\"environmental actions\\" and any (other) proceedings known to be under contemplation by governmental authorities. This section must include a description of the factual basis alleged to underlie the proceedings and the court action(s) sought. =Securities of the registrant= Sample Market for Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters Item 201: Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters While this information is usually available through Internet search engines, it must still be disclosed in detail. This disclosure is especially important for smaller companies whose stocks trade infrequently and for companies trading on multiple markets (including more than one market per type of common stock). The number of shareholders and all holders of five percent or more of shares must be revealed. Dividend history and intent to pay or not pay dividends must be discussed. Securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans must be revealed; this also involves Regulation S-X. A performance graph that shows the \\"yearly percentage change in the registrant's cumulative total shareholder return on a class of common stock\\" is required. Figures must also be compared with one or more \\"peer issuer(s) selected in good faith\\". Item 202: Description of Registrant's Securities This section involves describing different share classes and any provisions of the registrant's charter or by-laws that affect them, such as any clauses that may act as a \\"poison pill\\". In addition, such factors as liability of shares to foreign tax must be disclosed. =Financial information= Sample Item 6 of Form 10-K Item 301: Selected Financial Data This item asks for selected financial data to be presented, in a comparative columnar form, for each of the last five fiscal years and any additional fiscal years necessary to prevent the information from being misleading.17 C.F.R. ¬ß229.301 Such financial data should include net sales or operating revenues, income (loss) from continuing operations, income (loss) from continuing operations per common share, total assets, long-term obligations and redeemable preferred stock, and cash dividends declared per common share.See S-K Item 301, Instructions 1 and 2 The financial data can also include any additional items that would help with understanding the financial condition and results of operations.See S-K Item 301, Instruction 2. Item 302: Supplementary Financial Information Regarding quarterly financial data, this item looks for changes caused by such events as: disposals of business segments; extraordinary, unusual or infrequently occurring items; and matters related to gas and oil. Regulation S-X is relevant to this item. Item 303: Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A;) of financial condition and results of operations Item 303 requires a narrative explanation of any changes in the financial condition or results of operation of a company. The SEC expects that the MD&A; meaningfully reflects the results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, and the impact of inflation.See Reg S-K, Item 303 Its objectives are: to provide in one section of a filing, material historical and prospective textual disclosure enabling investors and others to assess the financial condition and result of operations of the registrant, with particular emphasis on the registrant's prospects for the future.Securities Act Release No. 6835 (May 18, 1989) Because the registrant must disclose a known trend or uncertainty that would likely have a material effect on the registrant's financial condition or result of operations, the MD&A; should include management's identification and evaluation of the information important to providing investors and others an accurate understanding of the company's current and prospective financial position and operating results.See Securities Act Release No. 6835 (May 18, 1989); Instructions to Item 303 Per Regulation S-K, in the MD&A; companies are required to disclose any known trends, events, or uncertainties that are \\"reasonably likely to result in a registrant's liquidity increasing or decreasing in a material way\\". This section can be lengthy. E.g., in Google, Inc.'s 2009 10-K filing, the \\"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\\" section was 20 pages long.Google's 2009 10-K filing Item 304: Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure This item highlights any disagreements between the company and its auditors and accountants. Such disagreements can cause difficulties with the validity of financial statements and with Regulation S-X, so are rarely reported under this item. Item 305: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Companies are given a choice of three disclosure alternatives: # Tabular presentation of information related to market risk sensitive instruments; # Sensitivity analysis of potential loss in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments; or # Value-at-risk disclosures of the potential loss in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from relevant market rates or prices. This disclosure may be done either mathematically or with a narrative explanation within, for instance, the company's Annual Report.Wal-Mart Market risk assessment Item 307: Disclosure Controls and Procedures This extremely brief item asks \\"Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers ... regarding the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures ... as of the end of the period covered by the report, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures\\". Despite its brevity, this item requires significant auditing and other work. Item 308: Internal Control over Financial Reporting As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted the rule that is now Item 308, requiring subject companies to include in their annual reports a report of management on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include: * A statement of management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company; * Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the company's most recent fiscal year; * A statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting; and * A statement that the registered public accounting firm that audited the company's financial statements included in the annual report has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of the company's internal control over financial reporting. This attestation report must likewise be filed as part of the annual report, and management must make certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. =Management and \\"Certain Security Holders\\"= Item 401: Directors, Executive Officers, Promoters and Control Persons This item indicates who is running the company and what financial stake they have in it. Also required to be disclosed are relationships such as family members; significant employees who are not directors or officers; backgrounds and experience in business of all parties; other directorships; and promoters and control persons. Item 402: Executive Compensation Sample 2009 Compensation ReportPfizer Inc.(Schedule 14A) While this disclosure is required in Form 10-K, it is often performed in the Annual Report and incorporated by reference in Form 10-K by large companies such as Pfizer.Pfizer Inc. Form 10-K Item 403: Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management The company must carefully furnish, to the very best of its knowledge, information about major shareholders in tabular format, as of the most recent practicable date, with respect to any person or \\"group\\" (see section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act for the definition of a \\"group\\") who is the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of the registrant's voting securities, the total number of shares beneficially owned and the amount the owner has the right to acquire, plus the address of each person or entity. This information may be found in form 10-K or in other places referred to in that form, such as the proxy statement; the latter is, like form 10-K, filed with the SEC's EDGAR system, entitled \\"DEF 14 A (Definitive Proxy Statement)\\".Ford Proxy Statement Item 404: Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons This item requires the disclosure of any conflicts or potential conflicts of interests, with a cut-off lower limit of $US120,000. What is required to be disclosed includes \\"any other information regarding the transaction or the related person in the context of the transaction that is material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction.\\" The parties in question include multiple possible parties, such as directors, nominees for directorship, relatives, and all entities with indirect interests. Item 405: Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act Under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directors, officers, and principal stockholders must file reports and must do so within certain time deadlines. Item 405 requires the company to examine these filings and, if any were late, to reveal this in a report in this section. Item 406: Code of ethics A company need not have a code of ethics; however, if they do not, they are required to explain why not, and most publicly traded companies have such a code.Sarbannes-Oxley Act and Codes of Ethics for Corporate Governance If the company has a website then the code must be on it, although not necessarily on the front page. Item 407: Corporate Governance This has seven clauses: # Director independence # Board meetings and committees # Annual meeting attendance # Nominating committee # Audit committee # Audit committee financial expert # Compensation committee # Communications from shareholders Other than the third, which is an attendance check with the count to be publicly reported, the other clauses allow significant flexibility in implementation (or even non-compliance, if an explanation is given). Most major corporations have adopted similar measures; as a result it is more easy to see, as compared to the era before passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, how companies comparatively implement corporate governance. =Registration Statement and Prospectus Provisions= This section has a well-established regulatory history and is not prone to sudden large changes. Its main use is to cleanly and clearly specify, first, a consistent format that can be used to define the material needed for a prospectus and, second, how to assemble the material together. Items 501 and 502: Cover pages * Item 501: Forepart of Registration Statement and Outside Front Cover Page of Prospectus * Item 502: Inside Front and Outside Back Cover Pages of Prospectus A physical paper prospectus may be printed and handed or given to potential investors, or (more commonly today) an online prospectus may be used; both versions must contain essentially the same information, in plain English. The information in the prospectus must agree with the information in Form S-1. Some specifications of 501 and 502 clearly apply to paper prospectuses but the same format can be used for online prospectuses. Some basic information is required: Name (and explanation if the name is similar to a well-known name), address, and phone number; title and amount of securities; offering price of the securities; whether there is already a market for the securities; name(s) of the lead or managing underwriter(s), if any, and the underwriting arrangements; and date of the prospectus. Beyond these basics, the following are also required as prominent \\"legends\\" (text boxes): A statement of market risk (which must be clearly indicated in the table of contents); a \\"State legend\\" (any legend or statement required by the law of any state in which securities are to be offered); and the \\"Commission legend\\" (indicating that \\"neither the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures in the prospectus and that any contrary representation is a criminal offense\\"). It is possible to make available an incomplete prospectus, provided that there is a \\"Subject to Completion\\" legend prominently displayed and no sales effort is made. Item 503: Prospectus Summary, Risk Factors, and Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges Item 503 requires a summary of the company, including any problems, in addition to a discussion of risks (especially those that are specific to the company). Among the frequent risk factors for new companies are: lack of an operating history; lack of profitable operations in recent periods; weak financial position; weaknesses in the business or proposed business; or even a lack of a market for their common equity securities. Item 503 also requires a disclosure of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, for companies that register debt securities. Item 504: Use of Proceeds This item requires disclosure of the purposes for which the proceeds from the securities to be offered should be used and the approximate amount intended for each purpose. Additional information is required if the proceeds for the offering are insufficient for the intended purpose or if the proceeds will be used for repaying indebtedness, buying non-ordinary course assets, or buying a business. If there are no clear plans for the proceeds, then this must be stated and reasons given for the stock offering. 504(7) notes that \\"[t]he registrant may reserve the right to change the use of proceeds, provided that such reservation is due to certain contingencies that are discussed specifically and the alternatives to such use in that event are indicated\\". Item 505: Determination of Offering Price This item has remained unchanged since passed into law on 16 March 1982. For common equity, where common equity is being registered when there is no established public trading market, or where there is a gap between the offering price and the market price, the various factors considered in determining such an offering price must be described. It may be specified that there is no rational means for determining a price. Item 506: Dilution This item requires the calculation and disclosure of how much dilution (a loss in value per share due to share issuance) will take place upon the stock distribution. The company must display: * The net tangible book value per share before and after the distribution; * The increase in such net tangible book value per share attributable to the cash paid by purchasers of the shares being offered; and * The amount of the immediate dilution to be suffered by the purchasers. Item 507: Selling Security Holders Along with offering new shares in the Form S-1 prospectus, prior shareholders may also register some or all of their shares for sale. This item requires disclosure of any such share amounts, who is intending to sell, and how many shares they will have left over after the sale. Item 508: Plan of Distribution The distribution is the shares to be sold and the way and manner in which they will be sold. If the securities will be underwritten, this item requires the company to: identify the underwriters; identify any relationships with the underwriters; note if the underwriting is committed (the underwriter must buy all the securities) or best-efforts (the underwriter only buys the amount of securities needed for sale to the public); and note any market-out clauses (which allow the underwriter to abandon the offering under certain stock- market conditions). The company must also disclose any other types of underwriting, such as interest or dividend reinvestment plans, that will be involved. Any plans for non-cash outlays such as acquisition, reorganization, readjustment, or succession must be noted. The details of any distributions through broker-dealers must be disclosed. If the securities are to be offered on an exchange, the exchange must be indicated. If the registered securities are to be offered in connection with the writing of call options traded (or to be traded) on an exchange, such transactions must be described. The company must provide a table that sets out the nature of the underwriters' compensation and the amount of discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriter for each security and in total. The table must show the separate amounts to be paid by the company and any current shareholders selling their shares as part of the distribution. Offering expenses must be disclosed in the manner specified in item 511. All discounts and commissions to be allowed or paid to dealers must be disclosed. If an underwriter has or may place a member on the company's board of directors, this must be disclosed. Any indemnification of underwriters must also be disclosed; moreover, if the underwriting agreement provides for indemnification of the underwriters or their controlling persons against any liability arising under the Securities Act, a brief description must be given of such indemnification provisions. The company must identify any finders (persons or entities who connect two parties for a fee) and, if applicable, describe the relationship between such finders and the company or any underwriter. Any principal underwriter that intends to sell to any accounts over which it exercises discretionary authority must be disclosed, including an estimate of the amount of securities intended to be thus sold. If the underwriters or any selling group members intend to engage in passive market making, the company must describe this. Any transaction that the underwriter intends to conduct or has conducted during or before the offering that stabilizes, maintains, or otherwise affects the market price of the offered securities must also be disclosed. Item 508 also specifies disclosure requirements for some warrant and rights offerings. Item 509: Interests of Named Experts and Counsel This item covers any kind of expert that might prepare a report to be included in or referenced by a registration statement, including lawyers and accountants. Accountants, moreover, \\"should note Rule 2‚Äì01 of Regulation S-X for the Commission's requirements regarding 'Qualification of Accountants' [that] discusses disqualifying interests\\". For example, in a registration statement it is reasonable that the company's lawyer will offer an expert opinion on the validity of the shares to be issued and the accountants will offer an expert opinion that the financial statements are correct. In general all material connections between the expert and the company and its principals must be disclosed, but such connections (other than employment for this purpose) are not common. Item 510: Disclosure of Commission Position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities Item 510 demands that boilerplate be included in registration statements to the effect that \\"Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable.\\" This wording is not absolute; alternate phrasing can be found that adds statements such as: \\"in the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director or officer of ours in the successful defense of the action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by the director or officer in connection with securities which may have been registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court or appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issues.\\" Item 511: Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution Item 511 requires an itemized statement of all expenses for the issuance and distribution of the securities to be registered. Typical expenses to be included are registration fees, Federal taxes, States taxes and fees, trustees' and transfer agents' fees, costs of printing and engraving, legal fees, accounting fees, and engineering fees. Item 512: Undertakings This item includes formal pledges (undertakings) that are applicable to whichever of 12 types of offering is being registered: Rule 415 offerings; subsequent Exchange Act documents by reference; warrants and rights offerings; competitive bids; incorporated annual and quarterly reports; equity offerings of nonreporting registrants; registration on Form S-4 or F-4 of securities offered for resale; accelerated becoming effective of registration statement; qualification of trust indentures under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 for delayed offerings; registration statements permitted by Rule 430A; filings regarding asset-backed securities incorporating by reference subsequent Exchange Act documents by third parties; and filings regarding asset-backed securities that provide certain information through an Internet Web site. =Exhibits= Item 601: Exhibits Registration statements filed online with EDGAR will invariably require the attachment of exhibits. These filings include ongoing reporting requirements, so exhibits usually accompany filings of S-1, 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K forms. The following Securities Act forms commonly have exhibits: S-1, S-3, S-4, S-8, S-11, F-1, F-3 and F-4. The following Exchange Act forms commonly have exhibits: 10, 8-K, 10-D, 10-Q, and 10-K. A complete list of exhibits is in item 601. Exhibits are not 'merely exhibits' or accessories but are important documents in their own right and must include proper, complete disclosure. Also critical are director and officer certifications and any Codes of Ethics. A filer may add more exhibits (frequently news items) under Exhibit 99 \\"Additional Exhibits\\". These are often to be found in form 8-Ks, which are very broad forms used to notify investors of any unscheduled material event that is important to shareholders, but Exhibit 99 may show up in other places. =Items 801‚Äì802: Industry Guides= Securities Act Industry Guides (Item 801) and Exchange Act Industry Guides (Item 802) provide instruction sets on disclosure compliance for particular industries. Primarily affected are companies with oil and gas operations, interests in oil and gas, and programs or companies that are engaged or to be engaged in significant mining operations. Aside from mining and petroleum, guidance is also given on statistical disclosure by bank holding companies, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of property and casualty insurance underwriters, and interests in real estate limited partnerships. The guides are divided into compliance with the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act but included in one PDF document, the SEC Industry Guides. =Items 901‚Äì915: Roll-up Transactions= In these transactions, small, private firms merge into a shell company, which goes public at the same time as the merger; this has the effect of several small competitors merging into a (theoretically) larger and more competitive entity. The resulting companies have not succeeded in general.Corporate Governance, Incentives, and Industry Consolidations These items are thus rarely seen in filings. The sections involved are: * Item 901: Definitions * Item 902: Individual Partnership Supplements * Item 903: Summary * Item 904: Risk Factors and Other Considerations * Item 905: Comparative Information * Item 906: Allocation of Roll-up Consideration * Item 907: Background of the Roll-up Transaction * Item 908: Reasons for and Alternatives to the Roll-up Transaction * Item 909: Conflicts of Interest * Item 910: Fairness of the Transaction * Item 911: Reports, Opinions and Appraisals * Item 912: Source and Amount of Funds and Transactional Expenses * Item 913: Other Provisions of the Transaction * Item 914: Pro Forma Financial Statements; Selected Financial Data * Item 915: Federal Income Tax Consequences Interpretations and Extensions of Regulation S-K =Environmental Law and Climate Change Disclosure= Although never explicitly mentioned in Regulation S-K, SEC Guidance points to the four most pertinent sources of climate change-related disclosure requirements, all contained in Regulation S-K: Item 101, Description of Business; Item 103, Legal Proceedings; Item 503(c), Risk Factors; and Item 303, Management's Discussion and Analysis (\\"MD&A;\\"). These are also the items concerned with environmental laws and environmental impact. Item 101 expressly requires disclosures of certain costs of complying with environmental laws. Item 101(c)(1)(xii) requires that appropriate disclosures be made as to the material effects that compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, may have upon the expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the registrant and its subsidiaries. Item 103 requires a registrant to briefly describe pending legal proceedings to which it or its property is a party, in particular any environmental impact litigation. A registrant also must describe material pending legal actions in which its property is the subject of the litigation. If a registrant is aware of similar actions contemplated by governmental authorities, Item 103 requires disclosure of those proceedings as well. Instruction 5 to Item 103 requires the disclosure of certain environmental litigation. Proceedings arising under any Federal, State or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment must be described if material, i.e., exceed 10 percent of the current assets of the registrant; they must also be described if a governmental authority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, unless monetary sanctions are to be less than $100,000. Climate change disclosure remains a fuzzy topic but four principal themes are discussed in SEC guidance:Disclosure topics, SEC Climate change guidance the impact of legislation and regulation; the impact of international accords; the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends; and the physical impacts of climate change.  History  The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS) Act required a review of Regulation S-K, which was published in 2013. The regulation was created in 1982 as the foundation of an \\"integrated disclosure system\\" to replace a duplicative patchwork of forms and introduce uniformity registration forms (such as the S-1) and periodic forms such as the 10-K. The SEC has periodically made updates, especially since the JOBS Act; in 2020, the SEC proposed eliminating 301, 302(a) and 302(b), and updating 303.

She spent fifteen years on the Upper Clyde crossings, followed by five years at Islay. Initially hoist-loading, via side ramps, these were replaced by a stern ramp in 1973. During her final years with CalMac, she relieved across the network. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to turn her into a floating restaurant, before she was scrapped in 1993. History MV Arran was the first of a trio of vehicle vessels ordered in 1951 to modernise the Firth of Clyde fleet. Three \\"general purpose\\" vessels were planned for the Clyde routes of their names, Arran, and . It rapidly became apparent that greater capacity was required in the summer and winter relief. was launched in 1957. Built by William Denny, she was launched from their Dumbarton yard on 22 September 1953, the last Clyde vessel to be launched there.General Purpose Ship for Clyde Services Railway Gazette 9 October 1953 page 417 The previous Arran of 1933 was renamed Kildonan, to release the name - she was scrapped on arrival of in 1957. Layout MV Arrans passenger accommodation consisted of a large lounge and a tearoom above, and a bar below, the car deck. The bridge was above the upper deck, allowing passengers unobstructed views forward. Officer and crew accommodation was below the bridge and at the stern. She was initially fitted with electric hoists and side-ramps to allow the loading of vehicles from conventional piers and at any state of tide. The 14-ton cargo lift had space for five average cars, which were turned on two 14-foot turntables on the lift and a further one at the front of the \\"garage\\". An aft cargo hold had two 7-ton derricks for cargo handling. These were removed in 1958 and the hold plated over, to provide additional car deck area. In November 1969, she underwent a ¬£40,000-refit at Lamont's. The tearoom was upgraded to a cafeteria/restaurant with a proper galley. The observation lounge was refurbished and additional crew cabins were provided. Watertight doors were fitted forward of the hoist and the side ramps were remodelled to better fit piers on her new service at Islay. She lost her Caley lions and was repainted in MacBrayne colours, although only briefly operated by that company. At her next major refit, costing ¬£100,000, in April 1973 she took the new CalMac colour-scheme and a stern-loading configuration. A new stern ramp replaced the hoist and side- ramps. The aft crew accommodation was transferred below-decks, displacing the bar into the lounge. Service MV Arran entered service on the Gourock to Dunoon crossing on 4 January 1954.New Vessel on Clyde Service Railway Gazette 15 January 1954 page 78 For fifteen years, she remained in the upper Clyde: Gourock to Dunoon; Wemyss Bay to Rothesay and Wemyss Bay (or Largs) to Millport. She relieved as the Arran car ferry. From January 1970, Arran was based at West Loch Tarbert and gave two weekday return sailings daily, one each to Port Ellen and Port Askaig. She also called at Craighouse (Jura) (until October 1970), Gigha and Colonsay. Once in stern-loading layout, she assumed three double crossings a day between modified at terminals at Port Ellen and West Loch Tarbert. Port Askaig was abandoned to Western Ferries. In West Loch Tarbert, she was able to stern load off a mild concrete slope with no linkspan, as tides are so slight. took over the Islay service on 14 August 1974, and Arran became a spare vessel, relieving regularly on both the Clyde and the Western Isles. A starboard side-ramp was re-fitted at the 1975 overhaul, so she could relieve at Dunoon. She was in service throughout the winters, relieving at Oban, Mallaig and Islay. She spent her final summers on standby at Gourock, frequently carrying gas tankers to Rothesay. The arrival of the new effectively made Arran (and ) redundant. , and were all available for relief. Arran made her last CalMac sailing, from Tiree to Tobermory on 19 July 1979, and was laid up in the East India Harbour, Greenock. She was sold to Orisot Ltd on 2 September 1981 as a floating restaurant-nightclub. She was berthed in Dublin, and underwent a refit costing ¬£750,000. Superstructure, including a helicopter pad, was built up aft, over the former car deck. In 1983, the enterprise was abandoned. In December 1986 she was towed to Salford Quays, Manchester, for a similar venture (possibly as Resolution), again without success. It was broken up in January 1993.

The series revolves around household robot Robotan, who is created By Kan-chan and lives with an everyday Japanese family as a domestic servant and friend to the children. Like Doraemon, his good intentions don't always work out, with comic consequences. The original series was produced by Daiko Advertising. Production moved to Tokyo Movie Shinsha for the 20th-anniversary color remake New Robotan (1986) under director Masaharu Okuwaki. Plot Robotan is a robot made by a school boy named Kan-chan, a nerd. He has special abilities like \\"Robotan Copter\\", \\"Robotan Punch\\" etc. His arch Rival is Botchi, a small kid who dislikes Robotan and makes several plans to destroy him or make him a slave, but Robotan destroys all his plans.

The studios providing the animation were Puppe Production, A Production, Sun Production, and Nakamura Production, all of which would take turns producing the episodes. All the stories were handled at Daiko Advertising, which would then be sent the four studios. The film would then be sent back to Daiko for editing and dubbing work. The series was aired on Fuji Television from October 4, 1966 to September 27, 1968 for 104 episodes. To this day, it's unknown how many episodes still survive.

The passport was first issued in 1987 after the Hong Kong Act 1985, from which this new class of British nationality was created. Holders of BN(O) passports are permanent residents of Hong Kong who were British Dependent Territories citizens until 30 June 1997 and had registered as BN(O)s. On 1 July 2020, it was announced that plans to grant BN(O) passport holders limited leave to remain allowing them to work or study in the UK for 5 years, and then apply for settled status after that. The holders can then apply for citizenship after 12 more months. This came as a result of the imposition on Hong Kong, by the Chinese central government, of the controversial national security law. This is something the UK considers a violation of the principle of 'One country, two systems' as set out by the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, an internationally binding treaty. Physical appearance =Cover= BN(O) passports are currently issued in their latest biometric versions (as of 2020) and they bear the \\"electronic travel document symbol\\" (20px) on the navy blue coloured cover. The text United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is present below the coat of arms of the United Kingdom; the wording British Passport is printed above the coat of arms. =Holder's page= The holder's page is identical to the identification page of British Citizen passports with the nationality being indicated as British National (Overseas). The machine-readable zone starts with P The request page, made in the name of the 'Secretary of State' (currently the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs), is also identical to that of a British Citizen passport. The nationality on the machine readable zone, however, is GBN rather than GBR. Each biometric BN(O) passport contains a contactless chip, which stores digital data and includes the holder's personal data, on the Endorsement page.Biometric-Passports , British Consulate-General Hong Kong, retrieved in 2008. Popularity =Initial rollout= Since the start of registration for the British National (Overseas) nationality on 1 July 1987, permanent residents of Hong Kong who were British Dependent Territories Citizens could either remain as BDTCs or register for the new type of nationality. People who chose to remain as BDTCs, however, would only be able to renew their BDTC passports for a restricted validity until 30 June 1997, while those who registered as BN(O)s would receive BN(O) passports valid for a full ten years. Registration for the BN(O) passports was not regarded as a popular, practical option during the early years (e.g. from 1 July 1987 to 21 December 1989, only 15% of newly issued passports were of the BN(O) type; the majority still held the British Dependent Territories Citizen passports). Permanent residents of Hong Kong had until 30 June 1997 to voluntarily register themselves as a British National (Overseas). =After the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong= After the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997, the British National (Overseas) passport became the most popular travel document among the people of Hong Kong. From April 1997 to the end of 2006, the British government has issued a total of 794,457 BN(O) passports. The peak was reached in 2001, when 170,000 were issued in a single year. Hong Kong permanent residents who are Chinese nationals can also opt for the Hong Kong SAR passport. By 2015, the less-expensive Hong Kong SAR passport has been granted visa-free access to more than 150 countries and territories. This makes the number of visa-free countries of the BN(O) passport comparatively smaller. As a result, only 30,000 BN(O) passports were issued in 2006 against an expectation of a peak in passport renewals. =From 2007 onwards= As of May 2007, there were 800,000 holders of valid BN(O) passports. Some 2.6 million out of the 3.4 million British Nationals (Overseas) did not renew their passports upon expiry.Lords Hansard, British House of Lords, 22 March 2007 As of 31 December 2015, there were only about 143,200 holders of BN(O) passports.Number of valid British passports by type, WhatDoTheyKnow, 11 January 2016 As British National (Overseas) cannot be passed through jus sanguinis to children of current BN(O)s, any children born on or after 1 July 1997 to parents with British National (Overseas) status only acquired either Chinese nationality or British Overseas Citizen status on birth (although it is possible for a BOC with no other nationalities to be registered as a British citizen). Any British Dependent Territory Citizens with connections to Hong Kong who had failed to register themselves as British Nationals (Overseas) by the end of 30 June 1997 would also be ineligible to make further claims for BN(O) from 1 July 1997, and those people would either become Chinese nationals or British Overseas Citizens. During and after the 2014 Hong Kong Protests, many BN(O) holders began to renew their passports with 22,022 renewals in 2014, this was up from 7,654 in 2011. As of 24 February 2020, there were 349,881 holders of BN(O) passports and the UK Home office estimates that there are around 2.9m BN(O)s in Hong Kong. As of 17 April 2020, the number of valid British National (Overseas) passports in circulation was 357,156. As of 2 October 2020, the number of valid British National (Overseas) passports in circulation was 469,416. Based on existing restrictions, as current passport holders die, the number of British National (Overseas) passports in circulation will continue to decline over the next decades and eventually will fall to zero. Previous versions of BN(O) passports Three black British (Hong Kong) passports (British Dependent Territories) issued prior to its replacement by the machine-readable passports in 1990. The cover of British National (Overseas) passport was originally navy blue, as in all other types of British passport. Earlier, residents of Hong Kong were Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies and their relevant passports bore the texts 'British Passport' at the top and 'Hong Kong' at the bottom of the cover. BN(O) passports sported a burgundy red cover, identical to that of the British Citizen passports, albeit without the words \\"European Union\\" text at the top part of the cover between 1990 and March 2020. When machine-readable passports were introduced on 1 June 1990, the cover colour was changed to burgundy. Between 1990 and March 2020, all BN(O) passports sported a burgundy red cover identical to that of the British Citizen passports, albeit without the words \\"European Union\\" text at the top part of the cover. These words were featured in the latter until April 2019, when the words were removed, causing their front covers to become identical in appearance to those of BN(O) passports, British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person and British Subject passports: the text United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland above the coat of arms of the United Kingdom; the word Passport printed below the coat of arms, and the \\"electronic travel document symbol\\" (20px) at the bottom. Endorsements The British National (Overseas) status itself does not automatically grant the right of abode anywhere (including the United Kingdom and Hong Kong). However, all BN(O)s possess the right of abode or right to land in Hong Kong by virtue of their previous British Dependent Territories Citizen status with connection to British Hong Kong. In this case, the following statement is printed in their BN(O) passport: British Nationals (Overseas) enjoy visa-free access for up to six months as a visitor entering the United Kingdom, however this limit may be extended in 12 months stints in the aftermath of the People's Republic of China's controversial passage of the May 2020 National Security Law and potentially lead to a future pathway to citizenship. The following statement is printed in each British National (Overseas) passport: British passports issued to British citizens after 29 March 2019 no longer carry the words \\"European Union\\" on the cover, making them identical to BN(O) passports in appearance. To further differentiate British Nationals (Overseas) from British citizens regarding EU freedom of movement rights, BN(O) passports renewed after 29 March 2019 carry the additional endorsement: This endorsement is identical to the one appearing on passports of British citizens from Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man without a qualifying connection, for more than five years, to the United Kingdom by descent or residency. Criticism The British National (Overseas) passports have been criticised for being too expensive, as compared to the HKSAR Passport, which has so far gained visa-free access from a similar number of countries as has the BN(O). In December 2013, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom announced backsourcing of overseas passport processing to their HM Passport Services in Liverpool. As a result, the fee for renewing BN(O) passports was reduced by 35% as of April 2014.Passport fees for British nationals overseas reduced by 35%, GOV.UK, 17 March 2014 =Counterfeit scandal in the 1990s= In the early years after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, the issue of counterfeit British National (Overseas) passports aroused international attention and government scrutiny, as such passports were being manufactured and used by illegal immigrants from the mainland of the People's Republic of China, who wished to gain direct access to the United Kingdom by way of Hong Kong.Hong Kong smugglers rely on UK passports, Daily Telegraph, 23 July 2000 Upon crossing the Hong Kong- Mainland China border, those illegal immigrants were easily detected by Hong Kong immigration officers, since the Mandarin-speaking immigrants invariably failed to understand or respond to officers communicating in Cantonese, the first language among Hong Kong's native population.Hong Kong: Gateway to the West, BBC News, 5 July 2000 With the introduction of biometric passports, the BN(O) passport has recovered credibility among the international community. Most immigration officers at major British and European ports of entry have been briefed on the six different classes of British nationality, so that they do not confuse a person using his or her BN(O) passport to cross the borders with other types of British nationals.. Use in the United Kingdom British Nationals (Overseas) are British nationals but not British citizens, and have not had the right of abode in the UK. After the passage of the Hong Kong national security law, the UK government made it possible for BN(O) holders to move to the UK permanently through a series of steps. Before July 2020, holders of BN(O) passports could only visit UK for no more than six months (or three months when arriving from the Republic of Ireland). For longer stays or other purposes of visit, holders of BN(O) passports needed to apply for the appropriate visas at the UK diplomatic missions overseas. Holders of BN(O) passports are ineligible to register for the Registered Traveller service for clearing immigration. They can, however, register with a HKSAR passport if they have one. On 1 July 2020, the UK government announced it would soon extend to BN(O) holders the right to work and study in the UK for a period of up to five years with limited leave to remain. After five years they could apply for \\"settled status\\" and then to be a British citizen after another year. Immigration, borders and visas = Hong Kong = BN(O) passport holders who possess right of abode in Hong Kong normally use their permanent identity cards to enter Hong Kong. For those who do not possess right of abode but right to land, they can present their BN(O) passport with non-permanent identity card for clearance. = Macau = Holders of the British National (Overseas) passport are allowed visa-free access for 6 months upon entering Macau. If the holder of BN(O) passport presents his or her Hong Kong Identity Card to enter Macao, the visa-free access period is lengthened to one year (12 months). = China = British National (Overseas) status is not recognized by the Government of China, so BN(O) passports are not recognized by Mainland China ports of entry controlled by Ministry of Public Security. In addition, the Government of Hong Kong does not allow BN(O)s to renounce their Chinese citizenship pursuant to the nationality law of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, BN(O)s who wish to visit Mainland China must obtain Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents in advance. = Taiwan= Like Hong Kong SAR passport holders, BN(O)s must obtain ‚Ä≥Exit & Entry Permit‚Ä≥ which can be obtained either online at no cost or for a fee on arrival, to enter Taiwan.\\"Entry requirements \\" Taiwan, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, retrieved in 2008.

Born and educated on Long Island, New York, Pomposello had an early affinity towards music, eventually teaching himself the guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, mandolin, dulcimer, and dobro. Getting caught up in the pop music revolution that swept the world in the wake of The Beatles, he had a particular interest in blues- based English bands like The Animals and The Rolling Stones, which led to a lifelong passion for American blues. After a brief thought of joining a seminary, Pomposello married young and had a son, Travis. Needing to earn a living without a college education, he teamed up with a close friend, Rob Witter, and opened a \\"hippie\\" record store in Huntington, New York. Emblematic of the times, the two named their business 'Kropotkin Records' (for anarchist Peter Kropotkin), and it distinguished itself from other, similar stores of the era for avoiding the sale of marijuana paraphernalia and concentrated instead on its owners enthusiasm for the rise of the album era of music, rock and otherwise.

Magnified crystals of iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4), the end-product of the Schikorr reaction along with hydrogen gas. The Schikorr reaction formally describes the conversion of the iron(II) hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) into iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4). This transformation reaction was first studied by Gerhard Schikorr. The global reaction follows: :\\\\underset{ferrous\\\\ hydroxide}{3Fe(OH)2} -> \\\\underset{magnetite}{Fe3O4} + \\\\underset{hydrogen}{H2} + \\\\underset{water}{2H2O} It is of special interest in the context of the serpentinization, the formation of hydrogen by the action of water on a common mineral.  Reaction mechanism  The Schikorr reaction can be viewed as two distinct processes: * the anaerobic oxidation of two Fe(II) (Fe2+) into Fe(III) (Fe3+) by the protons of water. The reduction of two water protons is accompanied by the production of molecular hydrogen (H2), and; * the loss of two water molecules from the iron(II) and iron(III) hydroxides giving rise to its dehydration and to the formation of a thermodynamically more stable phase iron(II,III) oxide. The global reaction can thus be decomposed in half redox reactions as follows: :2 (Fe2+ ‚Üí Fe3+ \\\\+ e‚àí) (oxidation of 2 iron(II) ions) :2 (H2O + e‚àí ‚Üí ¬Ω H2 \\\\+ OH‚àí) (reduction of 2 water protons) to give: :2 Fe2+ \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 Fe3+ \\\\+ H2 \\\\+ 2 OH‚àí Adding to this reaction one intact iron(II) ion for each two oxidized iron(II) ions leads to: :3 Fe2+ \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí Fe2+ \\\\+ 2 Fe3+ \\\\+ H2 \\\\+ 2 OH‚àí Electroneutrality requires the iron cations on both sides of the equation to be counterbalanced by 6 hydroxyl anions (OH‚àí): :3 Fe2+ \\\\+ 6 OH‚àí \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí Fe2+ \\\\+ 2 Fe3+ \\\\+ H2 \\\\+ 8 OH‚àí :3 Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 Fe(OH)3 \\\\+ H2 For completing the main reaction, two companion reactions have still to be taken into account: The autoprotolysis of the hydroxyl anions; a proton exchange between two OH‚àí, like in a classical acid-base reaction: :OH‚àí \\\\+ OH‚àí ‚Üí O2‚àí \\\\+ H2O :acid 1 + base 2 ‚Üí base 1 + acid 2, or also, :2 OH‚àí ‚Üí O2‚àí \\\\+ H2O it is then possible to reorganize the global reaction as: :3 Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí (FeO + H2O) + (Fe2O3 \\\\+ 3 H2O) + H2 :3 Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí FeO + Fe2O3 \\\\+ 4 H2O + H2 :3 Fe(OH)2 ‚Üí FeO + Fe2O3 \\\\+ 2 H2O + H2 Considering then the formation reaction of iron(II,III) oxide: :Fe^{II}O + Fe^{III}2O3 -> Fe3O4 it is possible to write the balanced global reaction: :3 Fe(OH)2 ‚Üí (FeO¬∑Fe2O3) + 2 H2O + H2 in its final form, known as the Schikorr reaction: :3 Fe(OH)2 ‚Üí Fe3O4 \\\\+ 2 H2O + H2  Occurrences  The Schikorr reaction can occur in the process of anaerobic corrosion of iron and carbon steel in various conditions. Anaerobic corrosion of metallic iron to give iron(II) hydroxide and hydrogen: :3 (Fe + 2 H2O ‚Üí Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ H2) followed by the Schikorr reaction: :3 Fe(OH)2 ‚Üí Fe3O4 \\\\+ 2 H2O + H2 give the following global reaction: :3 Fe + 6 H2O ‚Üí Fe3O4 \\\\+ 2 H2O + 4 H2 :3 Fe + 4 H2O ‚Üí Fe3O4 \\\\+ 4 H2 At low temperature, the anaerobic corrosion of iron can give rise to the formation of \\"green rust\\" (fougerite) an unstable layered double hydroxide (LDH). In function of the geochemical conditions prevailing in the environment of the corroding steel, iron(II) hydroxide and green rust can progressively transform in iron(II,III) oxide, or if bicarbonate ions are present in solution, they can also evolve towards more stable carbonate phases such as iron carbonate (FeCO3), or iron(II) hydroxycarbonate (Fe2(OH)2(CO3), chukanovite) isomorphic to copper(II) hydroxycarbonate (Cu2(OH)2(CO3), malachite) in the copper system.  Application fields  Anaerobic oxidation of iron and steel commonly finds place in oxygen-depleted environments, such as in permanently water-saturated soils, peat bogs or wetlands in which archaeological iron artefacts are often found. Anaerobic oxidation of carbon steel of canisters and overpacks is also expected to occur in deep geological formations in which high-level radioactive waste and spent fuels should be ultimately disposed. Nowadays, in the frame of the corrosion studies related to HLW disposal, anaerobic corrosion of steel is receiving a renewed and continued attention. Indeed, it is essential to understand this process to guarantee the total containment of HLW waste in an engineered barrier during the first centuries or millennia when the radiotoxicity of the waste is high and when it emits a significant quantity of heat. The question is also relevant for the corrosion of the reinforcement bars (rebars) in concrete (Aligizaki et al., 2000). This deals then with the service life of concrete structures, amongst others the near- surface vaults intended for hosting low-level radioactive waste.  Hydrogen evolution  The slow but continuous production of hydrogen in deep low- permeability argillaceous formations could represent a problem for the long- term disposal of radioactive waste (Ortiz et al., 2001; Nagra, 2008; recent Nagra NTB reports). Indeed, a gas pressure build-up could occur if the rate of hydrogen production by the anaerobic corrosion of carbon-steel and by the subsequent transformation of green rust into magnetite should exceed the rate of diffusion of dissolved H2 in the pore water of the formation. The question is presently the object of many studies (King, 2008; King and Kolar, 2009; Nagra Technical Reports 2000‚Äì2009) in the countries (Belgium, Switzerland, France, Canada) envisaging the option of disposal in clay formation.  Hydrogen embrittlement of steel alloys  When nascent hydrogen is produced by anaerobic corrosion of iron by the protons of water, the atomic hydrogen can diffuse into the metal crystal lattice because of the existing concentration gradient. After diffusion, hydrogen atoms can recombine into molecular hydrogen giving rise to the formation of high-pressure micro-bubbles of H2 in the metallic lattice. The trends to expansion of H2 bubbles and the resulting tensile stress can generate cracks in the metallic alloys sensitive to this effect also known as hydrogen embrittlement. Several recent studies (Turnbull, 2009; King, 2008; King and Kolar, 2009) address this question in the frame of the radioactive waste disposal in Switzerland and Canada.

The Babar diasporas is spread across Pakistan, and Afghanistan.  History  In the First World War 78 people of the Babar tribe from Pirpiai went to the war as Indian Army men and four were killed. Hence, Pirpiai is one of the very few villages which has an official plaque commemorating its First World War contribution. Babar, the ancestor of the Babar tribe was born at Takht-e- Sulaiman in 1175; six generations after Qais Abdur Rashid. The Babars were initially the same tribe as the Shiranis, also settled in and around the same region as the Babars. As far as the pedigrees show, Shirani was the father of Babar. The Shiranis have three sub-tribes, namely:[citation needed] * Marani * Miani * Babar Maranis still refer to themselves as 'Shirani' as they are the main sub-tribe, but Babars and Mianis identify themselves as completely separate tribes. The Babars are treated by some genealogists as a section of the Shirani Tribe. They are, in fact, the latter's neighbours in the Zhob District of Pakistan, but so distinct that neither has any sense of common tribal solidarity; the Babars even collaborated with a British punitive expedition against the Sherani in 1853. Hence showing, they never speak of such a kinship. In the 12th Century there was an initial settlement of a few Babar families in Chaudhwan, in the modern day district of Dera Ismail Khan in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. By the 14th Century, they had moved entirely from the Sulaiman Mountains. In the early 16th Century the tribe had moved to Chaudhwan and some to Zhob. In c.1534, some migrated on to Kandahar in present-day Afghanistan from Zhob. Meanwhile, in Chaudhwan, the Babars fought a battle against a local tribe and emerged victorious. In 1628, they fought another battle against the Gandapur tribe. Soon after, in 1647, the Babars fought off the Marwat tribe in order to gain full command of Chaudhwan by the mid-17th Century. Around the year 1700 or so, some Babars migrated up north to Pirpiai, which they established and held control of. In the reign of Ahmad Shah Durrani many moved east to Multan as well from Chaudhwan. By 1783, others had moved south to Shikarpur in Sindh. This is why the Babar diaspora is spread across Pakistan and Afghanistan today. However, the most prominent communities remain the same, the most notable of which is in Pirpiai. Chaudhwan still has a large number of Babars living there. Other communities include, Zhob, Quetta, Multan, Kandahar, Shikarpur and Karachi.  Structural Division of the Babar Tribe  The further subdivision of the Babar Tribe has been debated frequently in many genealogical books but the ground reality is very clear. The tribe is divided into sub-tribes based on the offsprings of four sons: * Maswad Khel * Gora Khel * Ibrahim Khel * Marwat Khel (Later modified as Mara Khel) = Maswad Khel = Maswad Khel is further divided into the following sub-sections: * Ahmed Khel * Mardanzai * Musazai * Bahadinzai * Ghorazai * Mochizai These Maswad Khel reside in Chaudhwan, Qila Saifullah (Pakistan) and Sheberghan (Afghanistan). The Ahmed Khel, however, mainly reside in Shikarpur (Pakistan) = Gora Khel = Gora Khel is further divided into the following sub-sections: * Yasinzai * Safarzai * Shakarzai * Khidarzai * Mangalzai Gora Khel reside in Chaudhwan, Qila Saifullah (Pakistan), Kandahar and Sheberghan (Afghanistan). The Yasinzai primarily live in Khangarh (Pakistan). = Ibrahim Khel = The Ibrahim Khel are known to be the most prevalent sub-tribe of the Babars. They primarily reside in Pirpiai, Mardan, toru, Chaudhwan, Multan, Ibrahim Khel Kot, Zhob, Chaman, Quetta, Qila Saifullah, Qilla Abdullah, Dera Ghazi Khan and Karachi in Pakistan. In Afghanistan, they have communities in Kandahar and Sheberghan, Paghman-kabul, . = Marwat Khel / Mara Khel = Mara Khel is further divided into the following sub-sections: * Mirzai * Sulaimanzai They reside in * Garda Babar * Lighat * shadezai babar.Zhob * sub section Mirzai babar are living in Shadezai Note: All sub-tribes of Babars except Mara Khel are present at Chaudhwan, that is why this town is labelled by English historians as a center of command and authority of Babar tribe.  Migration of Babars  = Pirpiai = Amanullah Khan Babar (Also known by his nickname 'Manu Khan') is the forefather of all the Pirpiai Babars. He was the first well known personality from the Babar tribe. Amanullah Khan belonged to the Ibrahim Khel sub-tribe and, hence, all Babars from Pirpiai belong the same sub-tribe. = Multan = Khan Bahadar Rub Nawaz Khan Babar was a famous Babar Pathan in Multan. He was appointed as a political agent by the British government, during their rule in the South Asia, in Chitral. Khan Bahadar Rub Nawaz Khan was a brave man. He fought a battle in Chitral for which the British government gave him the title of Khan Bahadar. When Rub Nawaz Khan came back to Multan he was appointed the honorary magistrate. And Ghulam Qadir Khan Babar was also a famous Babar in Multan. By profession, Ghulam Qadir Khan Babar was a great businessman, leading the Babar Khadi starting from Multan, Dera Ismail Khan, Calcutta and Bombay (India). = Muzaffargarh = Khangin Shumali It is a village situited 12KM from main city. Here large number of Babars live there. Descendants of Abdul Karim Khan Babar . 2\\\\. Khangarh: Khangarh is a town/tehsil of Muzzafargarh District. The Babars here belong to the Yasinzai sub-section of Ghora Khel sub-tribe of Babars. Initially from Chaudhwan, the family of Naik Qadam Khan Babar moved to Ghazni and settled there. The tomb of Naik Qadam Khan Babar can still be found there. From Ghazni, they moved to Bannu and then back to Chaudhwan. From Chaudhwan, their family head, Muhammad Hussain, moved to Multan. His son, Abdul Samad Khan settled in Multan. Allah Dad Khan, son of Abdul Samad Khan, moved on request of Khan Bibi (sister of Nawab Shuja Khan) to Khangarh as the administrator of Khangarh. His mango plantations of the time were famous. Saifullah Khan, son of Allah Dad Khan, was awarded the title of ‚ÄúNawab‚Äù and Honorary Majistrate during the British era. Nawab Saifullah Khan has six sons, among them Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan is a big name in Pakistani politics. = Sheberghan = Babars are widely scattered in Afghanistan, but the biggest community resides in the city of Sheberghan. It is the provincial capital of Jowzjan Province. Before the reign of Sardar Daud, four thousand families of Babars were living in Sheberghan. During his time, upon the arrival of the Soviet Army, the Babar tribe supported Mujahideen. As a consequence, the lives of Babars there became miserable and their killing and looting started. In 1953, 2000 Babar families moved further up to the mountainous areas while the remaining 2000 families moved to Balochistan (Pakistan). Pakistan arranged a camp for them in Loralai (Pakistan). A few years back, Loralai camp was abolished. One thousand Babars families moved back to Sheberghan, 400 families are scattered throughout Balochistan and 600 families or so, live as a community in Qila Saifullah. Babars from all four sub-tribes are found here.But 600 families are Moved to Kundahar ,Zairai Dashtah now they are there for 8 years. = Afghanistan = There is a rough estimate of 70,000 Babars living in Afghanistan presently, in very scattered places. The major settlements of Babars in Afghanistan includes: Sheberghan (capital of Jowzjan province) - 9000 families Kandahar (capital of Kandahar province) - 2000 families Minor settlements include: Maymana (capital of Faryab province) - 1500 families Other settlements can be found throughout Afghanistan including, Kunar province, Herat province, Kundus province, Lugar province and Baghlan province, Parwan province and town of Pule Khumri.Babar communities can also be found in the cities of Kabul and Ghazni. In the 16th century, a lot of Babar families migrated to Afghanistan from Chaudhwan and Zhob. They were tired of the high death toll resulting from bloody fights with neighbouring tribes for the sake of survival, water and lands. They were mainly rich people due to trading involvement. A majority of them settled in Kandahar, because Kandahar was a major economic and political center at that time in the region. Gul Mohammad Khan was the chief of the tribe here and he was a member of the Loya Jirga during Mirwais Hotak's reign. He was also appointed as the Finance Minister during the era of Ahmad Shah Durrani. In the 18th century, Nur Mohammad Khan, son of Gul Muhammad Khan was the Finance Minister during the era of Timur Shah Durrani and Zaman Shah Durrani. He did a lot for the Babar community in this whole region. In the 19th century, in the time of Sher Ali Khan, Amir of Afghanistan, Pakhtun tribes from South Afghanistan were motivated to settle in the North. The same policy continued till King Zahir Shah. This policy stimulated another big migration of Babars from Kandahar to Northern Afghanistan, mainly to Sheberghan. Nowadays, the main trade in Sheberghan belongs to Babar tribe. Tor Abbas Khan is chief of the Babar tribe at Sheberghan. The District Governor of Faizabad, Gohar Khan is also from the Babar community. The elders of these Babars still remember Chaudhwan as their native village. Mehboob Ali Babar belongs to grand grand Son of Haji Gul Babar, gul babar is a Zamindar of his village = Dera Ghazi Khan = Babars here descendants of two families: 1\\\\. Madu Khan He belonged to the Maswad Khel Babar sub-tribe and resided in Chaudhwan. He murdered his tribesman in the village. The Jirga decided to provide 200 animals and 2 women for marriage to the affected family in compensation. Madu Khan decided to leave the village. He travelled on the right bank of the Indus River and reached Dera Ghazi Khan, where he settled. His grandson, Abdul Karim, joined the British Police. Today, the majority of this family serves in the Police Department. 2\\\\. Charsham Khan He belonged to the Ibrahim Khel Babar sub-tribe and also resided in Chaudhwan. Charsham Khan Babar was a follower of Pir Khwaja Sulaiman. He moved to Druk, District Musa Khel, Balochistan to live with Pir Sahib. When Pir Sahib shifted to Taunsa in Punjab, this Babar family also accompanied him. From Taunsa Sharif, this family, later on shifted to Dera Ghazi Khan.  Notable people  Sardar Shadi Khan, Zakaria Khan Babar - Director FIA (Garda Babar), Malik zahir khan & Malak Kamal khan Babar (Aligadh) Notable People Amanullah Khan Babar (Manu Khan) Amanullah Khan Babar (Also known by his nickname 'Manu Khan') is the forefather of all the Pirpiai Babars. He was the first well known personality from the Babar tribe. Amanullah Khan belonged to the Ibrahim Khel sub-tribe and, hence, all Babars from Pirpiai belong the same sub-tribe. Initially, he belonged to Ibrahim Khel Kot, situated near Zhob. The remnants of the great fort built there by him still exist. The date inscribed on this fort is of AD 1650 (era of King Shah Jahan). By profession, Amanullah Khan was a great trader, leading the Babar caravan starting from Calcutta all the way to Bukhara. He was also a renowned as being a great warrior, protecting the caravans from being looted. Many heroic stories are told about his fights with different tribes. By the end of his life, Amanullah Khan moved to Pirpiai along with his family, the main reason for which was to save his children from his enemies. This migration towards Pirpiai is well known and remembered by all the Babars in Zhob and Ibrahim Khel Kot. His name is included in all the Shajra (Family Tree) collected from the Pirpiai Babars. With the arrival of Amanullah Khan, the Babars settled in the Pirpiai region, in the beginning of the 18th century (era of King Aurangzeb). All the Babars there today are his descendants. Gul Mohammad Khan Babar AD (1709¬ñ1747) Gul Mohammad Khan Babar belonged to the Gora Khel sub-tribe and used to live in Kandahar. There, he was the chief of the Babar tribe and Member of the Loya Jirga in the era of Mir Wais Hotak. Gul Mohammad Khan Babar was also the Finance Minister in the reign of Ahmad Shah Durrani (AD 1737-1747). He is also remembered most for his participation in the Third Battle of Panipat against the Marathas. Nur Mohammad Khan Babar AD (1747¬ñ1798) Nur Mohammad Khan Babar was a famous personality of his time. He belonged to the Gora Khel sub-tribe and was also from Kandahar. He was the son of Gul Mohammad Khan Babar and like his father, he was appointed as Finance Minister in the reign of Timur Shah Durrani. He later on continued with the same post in Zaman Shah Durrani's time. He was also the father-in-law of Zaman Shah Durrani. Nur Mohammad Khan Babar served and helped his tribesmen in Shikarpur, Multan and Chaudhwan. Due to his efforts, the Babar tribe was exempted from taxes and compulsory recruitment in the army during the Durrani Empire. Sadly, in AD 1798, Nur Mohammad Khan Babar was murdered on the order of Zaman Shah Durrani, his own son-in-law and Shah of Afghanistan. Abdul Kareem Khan Babar He belonged to the Ibrahim Khel sub- tribe from Multan. Abdul Kareem Khan served as Chief of the Multan Provincial Army in the Sadozai and Sikh regimes. He was famous as a great administrator. Sultan Mohammad Khan Babar AD (1795¬ñ1822) Another famous personality of his time, Sultan Mohammad Khan Babar belonged to the Gora Khel sub-tribe from Shikarpur. He was the grandson of Nur Mohammad Khan Babar. He was appointed as the Governor of Jalalabad in the era of Zaman Shah Durrani. He gave up his post and relocated to Shikarpur, upon the wish of his grandfather. Here, Sultan Mohammad Khan Babar purchased 50000 acres of land and also, a canal, from Dost Khan. He used to reside in Sultan Kot, just outside Shikarpur. Sultan Mohammad Khan Babar was also on really good terms with Shuja Shah Durrani since his daughter was married to Shuja Shah Durrani's son, Fateh Jung. Shuja Shah Durrani stayed at his settlement in Shikarpur for many months.he also help him in his last attempt for throne of Afghanistan in 1838. Sultan Mohammed Khan Babar was son of Behrose khan Babar governor of jalalabad in Tamoor Shah era. Zaman Khan Babar AD (1849¬ñ1901) Zaman Khan Babar was a Maswad Khel babar from Chaudhwan. He served as a Commander in the army of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. He also led the fight against the invaders from neighbouring tribes in order to protect Zam Chaudhwan (the only drinking water and irrigation source to Chaudhwan). Zaman Khan Babar was known as a brilliant warrior, leader and tactician. He also built a fort at Zam Chaudhwan. Allama Abdul Shakoor Rashad AD (1921¬ñ2004) Allama Abdul Shakoor Rashad was an Ibrahim Khel Babar from Kandahar. He served as the Deputy Mayor of Kandahar and later on in life was a Professor at Kabul University. He has written a total of 139 books. 59 out of which have been published and 80 are unpublished. One of his unpublished books, \\"Aminul Mulk and Babar Clan\\" is the leading source on the history of Babars. Colonel Mir Haider Khan AD (?-1973) One of the first Pukhtun officers in the British Army, he was a much respected village elder from Pirpiai, a man of distinction. He served as the last Defence Minister of Kalat before its accession to Pakistan. A major landlord of Pirpiai and a notable person of the Babar tribe, he was a man known for his flair and principles. He was an avid antique collector. Col. Mir Haider Khan was also the one who, for a large sum of money, purchased Peshawar Zoo and shifted it to Pirpiai. Famous British generals were known to have been invited to Pirpiai Fort by him, which included Field Marshal Gracy, Field Marshal Roos Capel, General Hastings, the Governor General of India and many more notables of the time. The barbecues and shooting parties of the time were famous. Most remember him as the man that put a face to Pirpiai and probably is the architect of making the village what it is today. Major General Adam Khan AD (1910¬ñ1973) A Sandhurst returned army officer, Maj. Gen. Adam Khan served in the British Indian Army and was later one of the first five Major-Generals in Pakistan. He was the nephew of Col. Mir Haider Khan and the son of Mir Safdar Khan. A distinguished officer of his time, he is still known in the Pakistan Army for his strong personality and principles. He was also appointed as the head of Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation. Maj. Gen. Adam Khan was a reputed landlord of Pirpiai, but in his later years chose to settle in the nearby village of Amangarh, where his sons and their families still reside. He was a recipient of the Military Cross, a British Military decoration, for \\"acts of exemplary gallantry\\". Major General Naseerullah Khan Babar AD (1928¬ñ2011) A very well known personality in Pirpiai, Maj. Gen. Naseerullah Khan Babar served in the Pakistan Army. Throughout his life he remained an important political figure in Pirpiai and enjoyed several other posts. He was appointed the Inspector General of the Frontier Corps and was a senior central leader of Pakistan Peoples Party. He served as Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from 1975¬ñ1977 under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government as well as the Interior Minister of Pakistan during Benazir Bhutto's second government from 1993¬ñ1996. He was a Special Assistant in Benazir Bhutto's first government from 1988¬ñ1990. He was awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat for single-handedly capturing an entire Indian company of soldiers during the 1965 war, and also the Hilal-e- Jurat, which he famously threw away along with other army medals at the presiding officer of a military tribunal, when Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged by the military regime of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Major Farouk Adam Khan AD (1940-) One of the most prominent lawyers in Pakistan today, Maj. Farouk Adam Khan is the son of Maj. Gen. Adam Khan. Like his father, he was also a Sandhurst officer and was the architect of The Attock Conspiracy, whereby with the help of his brother Maj. Iftikhar Adam Khan and other army officers, he hatched a conspiracy in the 1970s to topple the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. They were apprehended by the then serving General Zia ul Haq and tried in the famous Attock Fort, after one of their own lost his nerve and went to report the entire scheme directly to the Prime Minister. Hence, naming the conspiracy by the same name and sentenced to life imprisonment later commuted to 5 years each, which they served.

It is used to estimate the free energy and other state functions of a system, where ergodicity is hindered by the form of the system's energy landscape. It was first suggested by Alessandro Laio and Michele Parrinello in 2002 and is usually applied within molecular dynamics simulations. MTD closely resembles a number of recent methods such as adaptively biased molecular dynamics, adaptive reaction coordinate forces and local elevation umbrella sampling. More recently, both the original and well-tempered metadynamics were derived in the context of importance sampling and shown to be a special case of the adaptive biasing potential setting. MTD is related to the Wang-Landau sampling.Christoph Junghans, Danny Perez, and Thomas Vogel. \\"Molecular Dynamics in the Multicanonical Ensemble: Equivalence of Wang‚ÄìLandau Sampling, Statistical Temperature Molecular Dynamics, and Metadynamics.\\" Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 10.5 (2014): 1843-1847. doi:10.1021/ct500077d Introduction The technique builds on a large number of related methods including (in a chronological order) the deflation, tunneling, tabu search, local elevation, conformational flooding, Engkvist-Karlstr√∂m and Adaptive Biasing Force methods. Metadynamics has been informally described as \\"filling the free energy wells with computational sand\\".http://www.grs- sim.de/cms/upload/Carloni/Presentations/Marinelli.ppt The algorithm assumes that the system can be described by a few collective variables. During the simulation, the location of the system in the space determined by the collective variables is calculated and a positive Gaussian potential is added to the real energy landscape of the system. In this way the system is discouraged to come back to the previous point. During the evolution of the simulation, more and more Gaussians sum up, thus discouraging more and more the system to go back to its previous steps, until the system explores the full energy landscape -at this point the modified free energy becomes a constant as a function of the collective variables which is the reason for the collective variables to start fluctuating heavily. At this point the energy landscape can be recovered as the opposite of the sum of all Gaussians. The time interval between the addition of two Gaussian functions, as well as the Gaussian height and Gaussian width, are tuned to optimize the ratio between accuracy and computational cost. By simply changing the size of the Gaussian, metadynamics can be fitted to yield very quickly a rough map of the energy landscape by using large Gaussians, or can be used for a finer grained description by using smaller Gaussians. Usually, the well-tempered metadynamics is used to change the Gaussian size adaptively. Also, the Gaussian width can be adapted with the adaptive Gaussian metadynamics. Metadynamics has the advantage, upon methods like adaptive umbrella sampling, of not requiring an initial estimate of the energy landscape to explore. However, it is not trivial to choose proper collective variables for a complex simulation. Typically, it requires several trials to find a good set of collective variables, but there are several automatic procedure proposed: essential coordinates, Sketch-Map, and non-linear data-driven collective variables. =Multi-replica approach= Independent metadynamics simulations (replicas) can be coupled together to improve usability and parallel performance. There are several such methods proposed: the multiple walker MTD, the parallel tempering MTD, the bias-exchange MTD, and the collective-variable tempering MTD. The last three are similar to the parallel tempering method and use replica exchanges to improve sampling. Typically, the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm is used for replica exchanges, but the infinite swapping and Suwa- Todo algorithms give better replica exchange rates. = High-dimensional approach = Typical (single-replica) MTD simulations can include up to 3 CVs, even using the multi-replica approach, it is hard to exceed 8 CVs, in practice. This limitation comes from the bias potential, constructed by adding Gaussian functions (kernels). It is a special case of the kernel density estimator (KDE). The number of required kernels, for a constant KDE accuracy, increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. So MTD simulation length has to increase exponentially with the number of CVs to maintain the same accuracy of the bias potential. Also, the bias potential, for fast evaluation, is typically approximated with a regular grid. The required memory to store the grid increases exponentially with the number of dimensions (CVs) too. A high-dimensional generalization of metadynamics is NN2B. It is based on two machine learning algorithms: the nearest-neighbor density estimator (NNDE) and the artificial neural network (ANN). NNDE replaces KDE to estimate the updates of bias potential from short biased simulations, while ANN is used to approximate the resulting bias potential. ANN is a memory-efficient representation of high-dimensional functions, where derivatives (biasing forces) are effectively computed with the backpropagation algorithm. An alternative method, exploiting ANN for the adaptive bias potential, uses mean potential forces for the estimation. This method is also a high-dimensional generalization of the Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) method. Additionally, the training of ANN is improved using the Bayesian regularization, and the error of approximation can be inferred by training an ensemble of ANNs.  Algorithm  Assume, we have a classical N-particle system with positions at \\\\\\\\{ \\\\vec r_i \\\\\\\\} (i \\\\in 1...N) in the Cartesian coordinates (\\\\vec r_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^3). The particle interaction are described with a potential function V \\\\equiv V(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\vec r_i \\\\\\\\}). The potential function form (e.g. two local minima separated by a high-energy barrier) prevents an ergodic sampling with molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods. = Original metadynamics = A general idea of MTD is to enhance the system sampling by discouraging revisiting of sampled states. It is achieved by augmenting the system Hamiltonian H with a bias potential V_\\\\text{bias}: :H = T + V + V_\\\\text{bias}. The bias potential is a function of collective variables (V_\\\\text{bias} \\\\equiv V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,)). A collective variable is a function of the particle positions (\\\\vec s \\\\equiv \\\\vec s(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\vec r_i\\\\\\\\})). The bias potential is continuously updated by adding bias at rate \\\\omega, where \\\\vec s_t is an instantaneous collective variable value at time t : :\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\omega\\\\, \\\\delta(\\\\vec s - \\\\vec s_t) . At infinitely long simulation time t_\\\\text{sim}, the accumulated bias potential converges to free energy with opposite sign (and irrelevant constant C): :V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) = \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_0^{t_\\\\text{sim}} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\omega\\\\, \\\\delta(\\\\vec s - \\\\vec s_t)\\\\; dt \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad F(\\\\vec s\\\\,) = -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\lim_{t_\\\\text{sim} \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) + C For a computationally efficient implementation, the update process is discretised into \\\\tau time intervals (\\\\lfloor\\\\;\\\\rfloor denotes the floor function) and \\\\delta-function is replaced with a localized positive kernel function K. The bias potential becomes a sum of the kernel functions centred at the instantaneous collective variable values \\\\vec s_j at time \\\\tau j : :V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) \\\\approx \\\\tau \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{t_\\\\text{sim}}{\\\\tau} \\\\right\\\\rfloor}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\omega\\\\, K(\\\\vec s - \\\\vec s_j) . Typically, the kernel is a multi-dimensional Gaussian function, whose covariance matrix has diagonal non-zero elements only: :V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) \\\\approx \\\\tau \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{t_\\\\text{sim}}{\\\\tau} \\\\right\\\\rfloor}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\omega \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\left(\\\\\\\\! -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\vec s - \\\\vec s_j}{\\\\vec \\\\sigma} \\\\right^2 \\\\right) . The parameter \\\\tau, \\\\omega, and \\\\vec \\\\sigma are determined a priori and kept constant during the simulation.  Implementation  Below there is a pseudocode of MTD base on molecular dynamics (MD), where \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec r\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec v\\\\\\\\} are the N-particle system positions and velocities, respectively. The bias V_\\\\text{bias} is updated every n = \\\\tau/\\\\Delta t MD steps, and its contribution to the system forces \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec F\\\\,\\\\\\\\} is \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec F_\\\\text{bias}\\\\\\\\}. set initial \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec r\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec v\\\\\\\\} set V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) := 0 every MD step: compute CV values: \\\\vec s_t := \\\\vec s(\\\\\\\\{\\\\vec r\\\\\\\\}) every n MD steps: update bias potential: V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) := V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,) \\\\+ \\\\tau \\\\omega \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\left(\\\\\\\\! -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\vec s - \\\\vec s_t}{\\\\vec \\\\sigma} \\\\right^2 \\\\right) compute atomic forces: \\\\vec F_i := -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V(\\\\\\\\{\\\\vec r\\\\,\\\\\\\\})}{\\\\partial \\\\vec r_i} \\\\overbrace{\\\\left. -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s\\\\,)}{\\\\partial\\\\vec s} \\\\right_{\\\\vec s_t}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec s(\\\\\\\\{\\\\vec r\\\\,\\\\\\\\})}{\\\\partial \\\\vec r_i}}^{\\\\vec F_{\\\\text{bias},i}} propagate \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec r\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec v\\\\\\\\} by \\\\Delta t  Free energy estimator  The finite size of the kernel makes the bias potential to fluctuate around a mean value. A converged free energy can be obtained by averaging the bias potential. The averaging is started from t_\\\\text{diff}, when the motion along the collective variable becomes diffusive: :\\\\bar F(\\\\vec s) = - \\\\frac{1}{t_\\\\text{sim} - t_\\\\text{diff}} \\\\int^{t_\\\\text{sim}}_{t_\\\\text{diff}} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!V_\\\\text{bias}(\\\\vec s, t)\\\\, dt + C Applications Metadynamics has been used to study: * protein folding * chemical reactions * molecular docking * phase transitions. * encapsulation of DNA onto hydrophobic and hydrophilic single-walled carbon nanotubes.

He played for his local club Rower-Inistioge and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1963 until 1969. Playing career =Rower-Inistioge= Murphy began his hurling career at club level with Rower-Inistioge. After coming to prominence as an 11-year-old member of the club's successful under-14 team, he progressed through the juvenile and underage ranks before eventually joining the club's senior team. The high point of Murphy's club career occurred on 27 April 1969 when he claimed a Kilkenny Senior Championship title after a 3-09 to 3-07 defeat of Bennettsbridge in the 1968 final. =Kilkenny= Minor and intermediate Murphy first played for Kilkenny as a 16-year-old when he was drafted onto the minor team for the 1960 Leinster Championship. He won a Leinster Minor Championship medal in his debut year after the 6-14 to 5-05 win over Wexford. Murphy later won an All-Ireland medal after scoring a hat-trick of goals in the 7-12 to 1-11 final defeat of Tipperary. After missing the following year's minor championship due to his priesthood studies, Murphy was drafted onto the Kilkenny intermediate team for the 1963 Leinster Championship. Senior Murphy's performance in the intermediate grade drew the attention of the senior selectors and he was one of a number of players promoted to the Kilkenny senior team prior to the start of the 1963 Leinster Championship. He made his first appearance in the senior ranks on 7 July 1963 when he scored a goal in a 4-09 to 3-08 defeat of Wexford. Murphy subsequently lined out in his first Leinster final and claimed his first winners' medal after the 2-10 to 0-09 defeat of Dublin. On 1 September 1963, he was selected at left corner-forward against Waterford in an All-Ireland final. He scored 2-01 from play and claimed his first All-Ireland medal after the 4-17 to 6-08 victory. After collecting a second consecutive provincial title after the 4-11 to 1-08 defeat of Dublin in the 1964 Leinster final, Murphy lined out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964. In spite of being regarded as the favourites, Kilkenny ended the game as runners-up after a 5-13 to 2-08 defeat by Tipperary. Murphy claimed his third provincial winners' medal as a substitute after a 1-15 to 2-06 defeat of Wexford in the 1966 Leinster final. On 4 September 1966, he again started the game on the bench when Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Murphy was introduced as a substitute for Pa Dillon at full-forward but ended on the losing side after a 3-09 to 1-10 defeat. Murphy's priesthood studies impacted on his hurling career on a number of occasions over the following years, however, he claimed his fourth provincial winners' medal after lining out as a substitute in the 3-09 to 0-16 defeat of Offaly in the final. On 7 September 1969, Murphy was again included amongst the substitutes when he claimed his second All-Ireland winners' medal after the 2-15 to 2-09 victory over Cork. It was his last major game with the Kilkenny senior team.

Closely associated with goddess Sankattarani and considered as one of the 108 Avatars of the goddess Durga, Bidaptarini is prayed to for help in overcoming troubles. Her legends are recounted during the annual festival associated with her, the Bipadtarini Vrata, observed by women, on the Between Dwitiya (Ratha Yatra) to Dashami {(Ulta Ratha Yatra ) or (Bahuda Jatra)} or Between 2nd day to 10th Day of the Shukla paksha (waxing moon) Tuesday or Saturday in month of Ashada according to the Hindu Calendar. Her legends established her name, Bipada ‚Äì Tarini, which literally means deliverer from troubles. Legend The hibiscus flower, holds a key place in the legend of Bipadtarini The puja (ritual worship) of Bipodtarini - a vrata (vow) performed by women - is followed or preceded by the telling of the legend of the goddess. The legend is set in Vishnupur or Bishnupur (in the present West Bengal), the seat of the Mallabhum kingdom from 7th century AD to 19th century during the period of Malla kings who belonged to Bagdi caste (Barga Kshatriya). The queen had a friend belonging to Mochi caste who ate beef. The queen was horrified to learn this, out of curiosity the queen wanted to see the meat. One day, the queen asked her friend to show it to her. The girl initially refused, fearing the wrath of the pious Hindu king, however later she complied with the queen's request. However, the queen got betrayed and the furious king rushed to kill her. The queen hid the meat in her clothes and prayed to goddess Durga for help. Subsequently when the king tore her clothes to find what was hidden beneath them, all he could find there was a red jaba flower (hibiscus). Even today the goddess's puja remains part of women‚Äôs rites and is performed for the goddess' intervention during a family crisis. Like some other manifestations of Durga, who are invoked during time of specific crisis, or to help an ailing family member, Bipadtarini is also prayed as \\"cure deity\\". The annual Bipadtarini-Puja is an important event in the religious calendar of most temples in the region. Worship Act of performing Dandi considered a significant ritual during the Bipadtarini puja at Asansol Bipodtarini is worshiped annually at Mahishilla Colony, Asansol, West Bengal. The ceremony or puja for Bipodtarini was first performed 20 years ago by Phani Bhusan Goswami and his wife Sabitri Goswami. The ceremony is attended by people from the Durgapur, Asansol, Burdwan and Birbhum areas. The celebration goes on for four days. The first day is the aradhana (\\"worship\\") of the goddess, followed by two nights of celebrations which include performances of traditional Bengali folk songs, bhajans and kirtans by artists from Bolpur (Shantiniketan) and the Birbhum district. On the fourth day the traditional bisorjon or immersion of the goddess in water is performed. Bipodtarini puja includes many rituals like the fasting observed by majority of women on the day of the puja. The tying of the red colored taga on the wrist is also one of the significant customs. The taga is a kind of thread considered to be made sacred through the various rituals on the event of the puja. The puja at Asansol also constitutes the performance of Dandi. While performing this act first the devotees have to take a holy bath, to cleanse of sin and purify themselves. Then from the place of holy bath to the place of worship, the devotees repeatedly prostrate before the goddess by lying down their full body on the ground with their arms on top and cover the full distance without walking. Later, a famous gurudev [Baba Dulal] saw a new avatar of Bipadtarini Ma not in his dreams but with open eyes in disguise of a beautiful teen_aged girl and then he started Bipadtarini Brata in a new manner. He always told the devotees to Worship Ma Bipadtraini as Ma and not as any goddess. Whenever you are in trouble just utter these words \\"Jay Ma Bipadtarini Chandir Jay\\" 3 times and Ma will protect you from that trouble. The Bipadtarini Temple in Rajpur(West Bengal) holds a top position as one of the most holy temples of India. The bipadtarini puja is also held annually in kfs kali mandir( bani mandir club ) by Falguni mohan ghosh & ABHIJIT GHOSH &with; the help of all the club members. This puja is special because it is held in the kalimandir from early 1950s. It is situated in Kumardhubi, Jharkhand.

It caused severe damage in Ierissos and the surrounding part of the Chalkidiki peninsula, with 491 casualties reported. Tectonic setting The Aegean Sea is an area of mainly extensional tectonics caused by the subduction of the African Plate beneath Aegean Sea Plate. In the northwest Aegean, extension on approximately W-E trending extensional faults is accompanied by dextral (right lateral) strike-slip on SW-NE trending faults, and minor sinistral (left lateral) movement on NW-SE trending faults, accommodating the diffuse plate boundary zone between the Eurasian Plate and the Aegean Sea Plate. The earthquake has been attributed to movement on the Stratoni fault, one of the W-E trending faults that shows predominantly dip-slip extension. Damage The earthquake destroyed the town of Ierissos and several villages in the surrounding area. 10,000 people were left homeless. The cost of the damage was estimated as 5 million drachmas. The minor tsunami caused no damage. Characteristics The Stratoni fault was identified as the fault responsible for the 1932 event because of evidence of surface ruptures recorded soon after the earthquake and from the pattern of isoseismals, which were elongated in a W-E to NW-SE orientation and similarly orientated volume of recently observed seismicity. From the observation of slickensides along exposed fault planes, the movement along the fault is dip-slip extensional with local areas of oblique slip with a component of sinistral (left-lateral) strike-slip. The extension direction is currently oriented north-south but, when the fault was formed, was oriented NNE-SSW, perpendicular to the fault trace, possibly due to subsequent clockwise rotation of the area. The earthquake was followed by three strong aftershocks (M=6.0, 5.7 & 6.2) in the period 26-29 September, and the largest (M6.3) on 11 May of the following year. A minor tsunami was reported, which was recorded by a temporary tide gauge, giving a maximum height of 1 m. The movement awoke the operator of a dredger, who saw a current spreading up the Strimonas River about an hour after the earthquake.

Career In his early career he was a motor cycle racer for motorcycle manufacturers such as Brough Superior, McEvoy and the Belgian arms company FN. At Pendine, Wales he won the Welsh TT in 1925 and the Welsh TT sidecar in 1927 on Brough machines. In 1930 he was recruited by the Czech arms manufacturer Frantisek Janecek, founder of the JAWA motorcycle company. Janecek wanted to build a cheaper motor cycle than their current model. Patchett's contacts with the Villiers company enabled a new JAWA model to be designed around the Villiers 175cc two-stroke engine which proved very popular. 9mm Sterling machine-gun Mark IV On the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Patchett returned to England and started work under the auto-engineer George Lanchester at the Sterling Armaments Company in Dagenham, Essex, helping to gear up manufacture of the Lanchester sub-machine gun. On his way out of Prague he managed to throw prototype samples of Janeƒçek's new anti-tank device over the wall of the British Embassy. By 1942, he was leading a design team to design a new sub- machine gun to the army's specification which was referred to as the \\"Patchett Machine Carbine\\". After successfully taking part in extensive army trials in the mid to late 1940s it was adopted by the British Army to replace the Sten gun and known by them as the 9mm Sterling sub-machine gun L2A1. A modified version, the L2A3, was the very popular Sterling Mk IV which saw service until the 1990s. In 1966, the British High Court awarded Patchett ¬£116,975 (¬£ as of ) for the British government's use of the machine gun he patented. The same amount was awarded to Sterling, which had sued for half a million pounds.

Facing ruin, he reluctantly approaches a wealthy aunt for assistance but is met with a stony- faced refusal. Returning home in a taxi, he finds a wallet containing ¬£2,000 left behind by a previous passenger. He takes the wallet, but rather than confiding in his wife he rents a room in which he secretes the money, telling her he needs the room for business purposes. Shortly afterwards his aunt is found murdered, with her safe having been broken into and robbed. Gillespie is the prime suspect, and wary of incriminating himself with regard to the ¬£2,000 and unwilling to face having to surrender the cash, his story is deemed unsatisfactory and he is arrested and charged with murder.

They lay eggs singly on various species of wild buckwheat leaves. The eggs are flattened and hemispherical in shape, and very pale green in color. The larvae range from a green to pink color and feed on buckwheat. The caterpillars are a light green to pink color, and are covered with bunches of short stiff pines. They have two rows of white spots running down the back. They eat the leaves, but some prefer to eat the flowers and young fruits. Chrysalids then hibernate. In Washington, the caterpillars feed on sulphur umbrella plants (Eriogonum umbellatum). In adulthood, males perch looking for female mates in depressions or gulch bottoms.

History It was the first local authority boarding school to be set up, following the recommendations of the 1943 Fleming Report, which were implemented in the Butler Education Act, of the following year.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/butler-education- act-1944 The David Fleming, Lord Fleming parliamentary committee, explored ways in which the benefits of a public school education could be made more widely available to those young people whose financial means and backgrounds made it difficult for them to enter what was an exclusive and expensive system. Ottershaw had no entrance examination or financial barrier for students to be accepted as boarders. School fees were subject to a means test, the poorest students receiving a bursary from the county council if their parents applied for one. The criterion for entry was a boy's \\"boarding school need\\", in other words, those students most likely to benefit from a residential education away from their home. Thus, many students came from families broken up by the Second World War, other such dire circumstances, or from environments that were not conducive to academic or personal development. There was, too, a proportion of entrants who wished to attend a boarding school but whose parents could not afford the fees at a traditional public school (United Kingdom). Entry was not totally restricted to children of Surrey residents. Ottershaw was established by Surrey County Council (SCC) in 1948, as a boarding school for boys aged 12 to 18. It was the first of its kind in the country to be entirely in the hands of a Local Education Authority. SCC had purchased the estate in 1945, after the war, during which time much of it had been used by the Ministry of Defence, as a vehicle park, and, for a while, the giant US Mobil petroleum company had its UK headquarters in the imposing mansion building, with its magnificent formal gardens. Prior to the war, Ottershaw had also been a boarding school for boys, when it was known as Ottershaw College. The first boys and school masters arrived in 1948 and were led by headmaster Arthur Foot. He was related to lawyer and Liberal and Labour politician Dingle Foot and Lord Caradon, the last English governor of Jamaica. Arthur Foot had taught at The Doon School in India, which some commentators called the country's Eton. He had made an outstanding contribution there, for which he was appointed a CBE. Ottershaw sat in of landscaped grounds that contained classrooms, laboratories, workshops, playing fields and the mansion itself. Arthur Foot based Ottershaw on Winchester College, his old public school. For instance, he introduced small desks called \\"toyes\\", with a backboard and cupboard, which each student had as their own property each term. Just like at Winchester College, every evening, students would sit at their toyes to study, in a large room, watched over by a prefect. Ottershaw was an unusual school because of the \\"character building\\" as well as academic achievement ethos on which it was founded, similar to Gordonstoun public school. But Ottershaw's curriculum, teaching methods, and school routine, were otherwise conventional. It had two streams; one with an academic, the other with a technical emphasis. Ottershaw had an organised games programme, with its soccer, rugby and cricket teams playing public school sides, including Eton, a wide choice of clubs and societies and an Air Training Corps, later the Combined Cadet Corps, with an Army section linked to the Queens Regiment. In addition, Ottershaw offered all activities available in public and grammar schools, including camps built by its student in woodlands in the school's grounds, during their spare time. Expansion The growing number of boarders at Ottershaw School meant the Mansion could not cope and in the 1950s this led to the building of what is now Tulk House. This was built in two stages, the first block, West House, being completed in 1952 to accommodate about 60 boys, followed in 1961 by a connecting block, Tulk House (named after the first Chairman of the Governors, Mr J A Tulk). The school was divided into four Houses (North, East, West & Tulk) of approximately 60 boys each. The four Housemasters looked after the boys' welfare and in addition each boy was also allotted a Tutor whose duty it was to look after the boys' academic work. Mostly, the school was only open to boys resident in Surrey. But boys who were a sons of a member of the British Armed Forces, or, whose parents were normally resident abroad, could also attend. Extra-curricular activities In addition to normal academic work and sport, boys also had to perform daily duties around the school via Duty Squads. These included Servers (who laid tables and brought in food at meals), Clearers (who cleared tables after meals) and Sweepers (who swept floors, changing areas and stairs). Outdoor squads took care of pitches and playing fields, gardening and paths. Others took care of workshops and other school buildings or collected laundry, rang school bells, delivered post or took care of sports equipment. Community responsibility was taken much further than duties within the school. Pupils undertook an extensive range of projects within the local community and further afield. They renovated classrooms for local Primary Schools, erected bus shelters, built accommodation for the Cheshire Foundation, helped on the newly formed Ockenden Venture and constructed a Youth Club building in Camberwell. Within the school itself, pupils built the cricket pavilion, the Staff Room and the Sixth Form Centre all under the supervision of the school's technical staff.  Headmasters  In 1964, Arthur Foot retired and Allan Dodds was appointed as the new headmaster. Dodds was a Cambridge graduate, previously a housemaster at St Peter's York, a justice of the peace, Samaritan and founder of the Boarding Schools Association. He successfully saw the school, of just 250 students, through a rapidly changing educational climate. But, at that size, which gave it a lower student to teacher ratio than the most exclusive public schools, the Conservative Party (UK) politicians who ran Surrey county council, did not think it represented value for money. After Ottershaw School closed, Dodds first became a Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) civil servant, before being appointed personal assistant to the Bishop of Southwark, the Right Reverend Ronald Bowlby. Dodds died in March 2016. His son Richard Dodds OBE, who grew up at the school, is a former English field hockey player and was captain of the gold medal-winning Great Britain squad in the 1988 Summer Seoul Olympics. He is currently a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in Berkshire, UK. Closure Financial considerations were always a concern for the cost- cutting Surrey County Council chiefs, despite the economies achieved by the school's frugal organisation. A substantial increase in student numbers might have made Ottershaw more cost effective, and various measures were proposed by campaigners to achieve this. However, despite vigorous political lobbying taken to the House of Commons by students, staff, parents and friends of Ottershaw, the county council took the decision to close the school in 1980. Since 1981, the site has been redeveloped as an upmarket residential estate. There is an active Old Boys Society.

Born in Waterford, Dunphy first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel after the 1964 championship. Dunphy immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won one Leinster medal and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions Dunphy won one Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute. At club level he is a one-time championship medallist with Mooncoin. Dunphy's father, Eddie, his uncles, Joe, William and Wattie, and his brother, Dick, all played for Kilkenny at different stages. Throughout his career Dunphy made 5 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1967 championship. In retirement from playing Dunphy became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with the Kilkenny All-Ireland-winning minor team in 2003. Playing career =Club= After a glittering underage career that yielded four minor championship medals in five years, Dunphy was still eligible for the minor team when he was added to the Mooncoin junior team in 1961. A huge 4‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì2 defeat of Coon gave him a championship medal in that grade. By 1965 Dunphy was a key fixture on the Mooncoin senior team that qualified for the decider for the first time in a decade. Reigning champions Bennettsbridge provided the opposition, however, a narrow 2‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì8 victory gave Dunphy a Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship medal. =Inter-county= Dunphy first played for Kilkenny in 1961 when he had the honour of captaining the team. A huge 4‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì7 defeat of Dublin gave him his first Leinster medal. The subsequent All- Ireland decider pitted Tipperary against Kilkenny. A 3‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì15 victory gave Dunphy an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Irish Press Cup. In 1962 Dunphy was captain of the minor team once again. A narrow 5‚Äì7 to 5‚Äì4 defeat of Wexford gave him a second successive Leinster medal. For the second successive year Tipperary provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Goals were key as a 3‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Dunphy his second All-Ireland medal. He remains the only player to captain back-to-back All-Ireland-winning teams. Dunphy first joined the Kilkenny senior team in late 1964 during the Oireachtas Tournament. He was a regular during the subsequent National Hurling League campaign and made his senior championship debut on 27 June 1965 in a 1‚Äì20 to 3‚Äì8 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin. In 1966 Dunphy collected his first silverware with the Kilkenny senior team. An aggregate 10‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì15 defeat of New York in the league decider gave him a National Hurling League medal. Dunphy later won a Leinster medal following a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of reigning provincial champions Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against Cork for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the red hot favourites, however, a hat-trick of goals by Colm Sheehan gave Cork a merited 3‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì10 victory. =Inter-provincial= Dunphy was added to the Leinster inter-provincial team in 1965. He was an unused substitute as Leinster beat arch rivals Munster by 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9. Coaching career In 2003 Dunphy was part of the selection team to the Kilkenny minor team. That year he helped steer the team to the Leinster title following an 0‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì13 defeat of Offaly. Kilkenny subsequently faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider. Richie Power gave a masterclass of hurling, including scoring the winning point deep into injury time, to secure a 2‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì15 victory. Dunphy was still part of the managerial team again in 2004. Kilkenny retained the Leinster title that year following a heavy 1‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì4 defeat of Dublin. The subsequent All- Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against Galway. Richie Hogan proved to be the hero for Kilkenny, as his point, a minute into injury time, earned \\"the Cats\\" a 1‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì12 draw. The replay a week later was also a close affair, with Galway just about holding off the Kilkenny challenge to win by 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12.

Protests and campaigns In recent times, most of its campaigns were against the plans privatization of education institutions and claiming they are destroying the free education which existed in the country since 1 October 1945. Notable leaders * Shantha Bandara - Founding leader and the first convener of IUSF. Drop-out of University of Peradeniya and a prominent leader of JVP. Involved in the unsuccessful JVP insurrection during 1987-1989. Killed in January 1990. * Sunil Handunnetti - Former convener of the IUSF, member of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, member of the central committee of JVP and contested the 2010 Sri Lanka Parliamentary elections under the Democratic National Alliance (DNA), which is led by former army chief Sarath Fonseka and was re-elected to Parliament from the Colombo District. * Ranjitham Gunaratnam - Former convener of the IUSF and a drop out of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. He was the leader of the Peradeniya AC (Action Committee) in 1985, a JVP Central Committee Member and its Kurunegala District leader. Gunaratnam was abducted in December 1989, detained, tortured and killed at Wehera, Kurunegala. Corrections required here: Ranjtham Gunaratnam was not the leader of Peradeniya AC in 1985. The leader (we called the position as convener) of Peradeniya AC in 1985 was Gunapala Gajanayake, a student from the Faculty of Engineering. He was not a member of the JVP or its student arm, Samajavadee Sishya Sangamaya (Socialist Student Union) like Ranjitham. * Ravindra Mudalige - Former convener of the IUSF. * Chameera Koswatta - Former convener of the IUSF, JVP Chief Ministerial candidate for Sabaragamuwa Province at the provincial elections 2008. * Duminda Nagamuwa - Former convener of the IUSF (May 2004 to February 2008), drop-out of the Faculty of Science, University of Peradeniya and JVP Chief Ministerial candidate for Western Province at the provincial elections 2009. * Udul Premaratne - Former convener of the IUSF (February 2008 to January 2011), drop-out of the Faculty of Dental Sciences, University of Peradeniya. * Sanjeewa Bandara - Former convener of the IUSF. A student of University of Ruhuna. * Najith Indika - Former convener of the IUSF. A student of Colombo University Medical Faculty *Lahiru Weerasekara - Former the convener of IUSF (2015-November 2018). Political affiliation The IUSF is formally affiliated to Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Criticism Conduct of the student union has drawn much criticism in media and university administrations. As a result, University of Jaffna banned IUSF from entering to the university premises in June 2010. Previously, University of Colombo and University of Moratuwa have taken steps to ban the student group from the university. IUSF has been accused of the murder of Samantha Vithanage, a third year Management student of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, who pioneered an anti-ragging campaign in the university. =Strikes= IUSF admits that it uses strikes as the primary method to meet their demands as it sees no other plausible way. This has raised number of issues regarding the student discipline. Boycotting lectures has caused delays in student graduation time and cancellation of studentships in number of occasions. =Ragging= IUSF is also criticized for not being able to take necessary action to prevent ragging in Sri Lankan universities. Instead, rival groups such as International Students for Social Equality have suggested that IUSF uses ragging as a means of attracting a following among more backward students. At the beginning, senior students alleged that ragging served as a social equalizer in the universities. But with the emergence of JVP-backed student unions such as IUSF, ragging has served primarily to ensure the continuing domination of JVP political power within the universities, academics suggest. =Political intolerance= Violence inside universities has steadily increased due to political intolerance. IUSF has been accused of obstructing and engineering clashes with rival political groups inside universities. In 2009, Prof. Nalin de Silva - Dean of the faculty of Science at the University of Kelaniya - complained that pro-JVP IUSF students have threatened him with death for not agreeing to their political ideologies. =Picketings= Picketing is another form of protest employed by IUSF to meet their demands by forcing the government. The purpose of most of those protests refer to the protection of \\"Free Education System\\" and protecting the student rights. Picketings around Lipton Circus, Maradana and the country's busiest urbs has become common in the recent times. These picketings usually cause traffic jams and chaos in the city with police using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the gathering. This has resulted in public inconvenience.

The line was promoted by the Buckinghamshire Railway which was formed in 1847 to construct two routes: one from Bletchley to Oxford, later known as the Varsity Line, and another to Banbury. The line to Banbury was opened in May 1850 and the Oxford section followed in October of the same year. The line was worked by the London and North Western Railway, which absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1879. In 1923, the London and North Western became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping. The line became part of British Railways upon nationalisation on 1 January 1948. Increasing competition from motor transport and dwindling receipts after the Second World War led to the line being chosen in 1956 for an experiment with British Rail Derby Lightweight diesel multiple units in an attempt to stem the losses. Although the units were well-patronised, the deficit was not reduced sufficiently to justify keeping the line open. The section between Banbury and Buckingham closed on 2 January 1961, with the section Buckingham-Verney Jn abandoned on 5 December 1966. None of the station buildings have survived, although some sections of the line are now public footpaths. Authorisation and opening The Buckinghamshire Railway was formed in 1847 to construct a line from to , with a branch to from Bletchley. The scheme was designed to foil the Great Western Railway's (GWR) attempts to reach Birmingham. The Buckinghamshire Railway was backed by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) which provided ¬£450,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) towards costs. Construction began in July 1847, but financial difficulties meant that the single-track line from Bletchley to Banbury was only completed three years later on 30 March 1850; it opened to passengers on 1 May that year. Goods and coal traffic was accepted from 15 May 1850. The line to Oxford did not open throughout until 20 May 1851 and was later known as the Varsity Line. The line's northern terminus at Merton Street in Banbury was a modest structure to the east of the GWR's own station. Originally intended as a temporary building, the station's timber construction gave the arriving passenger the feeling of arriving at a frontier and would not have been out of place on the Union Pacific Railroad. Intermediate stations were provided at , and . Services ran straight through to until 1868 when was opened to create an interchange with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. Operations =Passenger traffic= The original service provided four up and down trains, all worked by the LNWR, which had leased the line for 999 years from 1 July 1851, finally absorbing it in 1879. Most services from Bletchley to Oxford carried coaches for Banbury, although in some years the service terminated at Brackley. One or two services generally ran on Sundays, but these were not usually part of an Oxford service. From 1905, four services were running from Bletchley to Banbury, with one additional train terminating at Brackley. By 1920, an additional Brackley service had been laid on. Between 1901 and 1916 a through service from operated, which slipped a coach at Bletchley in the down direction. This practice was restored after the 1923 grouping, though initially the coach slipped only ran as far as Buckingham. Farthinghoe became a junction station on 1 June 1872 with the opening of the Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway, which joined the branch at Cockley Brake and allowed connections to , and Stratford. The section from Banbury to Cockley Brake was to become the busiest part of the line. New stations opened at in March 1878 and in August 1879. Passenger traffic was relatively light and peaked just before the First World War, although the LNWR tried to develop with specials and excursion trains. In 1889, a special service ran to from Buckingham upon the death of the third Duke of Buckingham for mourners to attend the funeral at . Another was operated in 1894 upon the death of the Comte de Paris who had rented Stowe House. Stowe House was later to bring new traffic to the line when it became Stowe School in 1923 and special trains brought the boys to and from the school. In the same year, the LNWR became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway upon the railway grouping. =Goods traffic= Freight consisted mainly of agricultural produce, milk and cattle for Banbury where there was a market next to Merton Street station. Ironstone was also carried from Wroxton via the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway and the GWR's Banbury station; coal and building materials were also transported. Final years =Decline= The single-track branch line from Banbury to Verney Junction possessed none of the strategic advantages of the east-west link between Oxford and Cambridge and even though efforts were made to save it, closure was inevitable. The line's principal objective was Buckingham, which had declined steeply since a disastrous fire in 1725 and the collapse of the wool trade. The first Duke of Buckingham altered the course of Buckingham's history when he opposed the proposed route of the London and Birmingham Railway through the town, with the result that it failed to attract early development and was overtaken by Aylesbury. Neither Buckingham nor Brackley benefited significantly from the railway, and population levels of both remained less than 2,500. Banbury by contrast did expand, but was better served by the GWR's main line from 1852. Passenger receipts were never high after 1923 and the coming of the motor vehicle had made serious inroads into traffic between the two wars, which was halted by the Second World War. The end of the war saw the railways nationalised and the line becoming part of the London Midland Region of British Railways. With the end of fuel rationing, passenger numbers began to decline again and the line's future was called into question from the mid-1950s after the ASLEF strike of 1955 when much of the milk traffic was lost. Sunday passenger services were withdrawn in the late 1940s and by now only four trains in each direction ran on weekdays. The first threat to the line came in 1952 when BR, having closed the line from Cockley Brake to Towcester from 2 July 1951, reduced services to three trains each way. The demise of the Towcester line resulted in the closure of Farthinghoe on 3 November 1952. By this time, the line was hanging by a thread, with a reported ¬£14,000 annual deficit (equivalent to ¬£ in ) and monthly receipts of no more than ¬£50. = DMU experiment = M79900 on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway In 1956, the branch was chosen for a pilot single-car diesel multiple unit scheme as part of the Modernisation Plan. Two experimental olive green British Rail Derby Lightweight units nos. M79900 and M79901 entered service on 13 August and operated a service between Banbury and Buckingham, connecting with a steam push-pull service to Bletchley. Eighteen months after their introduction, the need to change at Buckingham was eliminated when the units ran straight through to Bletchley. Two new halts were opened at Radclive and Water Stratford and Merton Street received a facelift. The units, which had a seating capacity of 52 (M79900) and 61 (M79901), resulted in a reported traffic increase of 400%. Such was their popularity that both were operated in tandem on Banbury market days (Thursdays) and Saturdays. In 1958‚Äì59, seven up trains and eight down ran on weekdays, with two extra evening services each way on Saturdays. The journey time to Verney Junction was 41 minutes, with a further 17 minutes to Bletchley. In 1959, British Railways announced that although the units were well-patronised at peak times, they tended to be empty during other periods. There was demand for the service from Buckingham, Fulwell and Westbury and Brackley, and almost none at Banbury where some people thought that the line had already closed. The units had increased passenger receipts by ¬£250-¬£300 per month and reduced operating costs by ¬£300, but this still resulted in an annual deficit of ¬£4,700 (equivalent to ¬£). =Closure= Closure notices were published in December 1959 with the final date of service given as 2 January 1960, but this was delayed due to failure to agree subsidy terms with Midland Red which was to provide a replacement bus service. The agreement reached would see two buses a day ply the route: one at 07.25 and the other at 15.31. The last service between Banbury and Buckingham ran on 31 December 1960, with official closure of the section coming on 2 January 1961. Goods facilities were withdrawn from 2 December 1963 and passenger services on the truncated Buckingham branch continued until 7 September 1964. The line to Buckingham was visited by the Queen on 4 April, when the Royal Train was stabled overnight at Padbury. Her father had previously visited Brackley station in May 1950 en route to the first British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The freight service to Buckingham was withdrawn on 5 December 1966 and the line was abandoned. Track lifting was undertaken in 1967. The line today Merton Street was demolished after closure and the site used for road haulage and livestock marketing purposes, before being occupied by a company providing temporary buildings. It is now covered by a residential development. Farthinghoe housed a railwayman until 1963, after which it became derelict and was demolished. No trace remains of the station, the site of which was used as a municipal waste tip by Northamptonshire County Council from 1968, before being closed and reopened by a private company as a recycling and refuse centre; the site comprises a large concrete hangar and a single-storey office and toilet block. The railway alignment to the west, south and east of the site formerly ran through a shallow cutting which was used as a landfill site in the 1970s and is now part of Farthinghoe Nature Reserve. Just beyond the site to the north, a stone five-arch viaduct has survived. Brackley station was abandoned after closure and after damage by vandals, it was demolished in the 1970s. St. James Road now occupies the site which is surrounded by a light industrial estate and residential housing. Some of the trackbed to the south-east is taken into Pocket Farm Walk before the route is severed by the A43 Brackley Bypass. At Fulwell and Westbury, the ruins of the main station buildings can be seen. The stationhouse is in residential use after having been restored from a derelict state. The station buildings at Buckingham were also demolished after closure and the site taken over by the Countryside Services of Buckinghamshire County Council; the site, including degraded platform remains, was returned to nature and a footpath now runs as far as the location of the goods shed. Padbury station was demolished in 1968 and houses were built on the site in 1975. The line through Verney Junction was mothballed in 1993, leaving the stationmaster's house as a private residence and the platform edges in an overgrown state. , the Government has funded works to reopen the main line between Oxford and Cambridge through Verney Junction (by 2025),Autumn statement: Chancellor invests in new transport links for the regionITV Anglia, 23 November 2016 but there are no known plans to reopen this branch. In January 2019, advocacy group the Campaign for Better Transport released a report in which they listed the line as Priority 2 for reopening.

Lister was the political editor and wanted to give SWAPO, Namibia's liberation movement, \\"a 'human face', showing the people, including whites, that they were not the 'terrorists' and 'communists' and the 'black threat' that the colonial regime made them out to be through their blanket propaganda.\\" The newspaper was officially banned in May 1984 after Lister travelled to Zambia to report on Namibian independence talks. Though the ban was lifted after an appeal to Pretoria's Publications Appeal Board, Observer management demoted her for having brought it on, triggering Lister's resignation and a walkout of the newspaper's staff. The following year, Lister began a new independent newspaper, The Namibian. Smith then ran the Windhoek Observer as a one-man operation, calling himself \\"reporter-in-chief\\". His daughter, Yanna Erasmus, later joined him at the newspaper. Smith adopted a \\"hard-line editorial stance against those in authority\\" and \\"did not bow to the South African nor the SWAPO government.\\" After Smith's death in 2008, Erasmus took over as editor.

The site has both biological and geological interest and has been designated of national importance in the Geological Conservation Review. The gorge is incised through the Namurian Great Limestone and is of particular interest because beds of sandstone in the middle of the section show structures characteristic of a shoreline, with the features of a river delta and barrier bar. The shallow soils that have developed on ledges and crevices in the limestone and on the scree slopes support a vegetation in which ferns such as maidenhair spleenwort, Asplenium trichomanes, green spleenwort, A. viride, and brittle bladder fern, Cystopteris fragilis, are prominent. Woodland plants such as wood sorrel, Oxalis acetosella, wood millet, Milium effusum, and dog's mercury, Mercurialis perennis, have established themselves in the shadier crevices, while rue-leaved saxifrage, Saxifraga tridactylites, shining cranesbill Geranium lucidum, and common whitlow grass, Erophila verna, occur in the most exposed situations. On the most inaccessible valley slopes, there is open woodland in which yew, Taxus baccata, is abundant. Dipper and common sandpiper have been recorded from the site and probably breed in the area.

While enjoying the independent way of life in the wilderness, he is also desperately longing for the woman \\"Ingrid √òdden\\", whom he knew from their childhood, and who later has married. After various conflicts with the village people Hans eventually ends up being caught and brought to prison.F√∏nhus, Skoggangsmand (1917) Hedal stave church in Valdres The legend about the Hedal Church is embedded in the story. During the Black Death, in the middle of the 14th century, the valley Hedal was depopulated, and the valley became a wilderness. A hunter, an outlaw living and hiding in the forest, one day shot an arrow after a capercaillie, but missed and instead struck the church bell, after which the hunter discovered the old church. Entering the church, there was bear at the altar, and the hunter shot and skinned the bear. The hunter subsequently settled at a deserted farm south of the church. The gathering Hedalsmessa, held at Michaelmas, is a central event in the novel. Reception The book received little attention by contemporary critics in Norway. It was received with enthusiasm by the later Danish Nobel laureate Johannes V. Jensen, literary critic for the newspaper Politiken. Jensen pointed at the similarities between F√∏nhus' picturing of the wilderness, and the international genre of wilderness writing. Follow-up F√∏nhus' literary breakthrough came with his next books, first the story collection Der Vildmarken suser, and the subsequent novels Det skriker fra Kverrvilljuvet and Troll-Elgen.

Plot Artemio (Pozzetto) is annoyed by his monotonous life as a farmer in the countryside of Lombardy. On his 40th birthday, he decides to move to the big city of Milan and look for a job and a new life there. There he meets his cousin Severino (Massimo Boldi), who is supposed to help him familiarize with the city, but actually turns out to be a trickster and purse snatcher. Having realized the illicitness of Severino's businesses, Artemio quits him. He later falls in love with a victim of Severino's snatching, a career girl named Angela. The gap between his countryman mentality and her modern and dynamic lifestyle leads to a number of comical misunderstandings, but also provides a basis for their friendship to grow. Meanwhile, Artemio's attempts at finding a job are impeded by his naivety and candor. The love affair with Angela seems to be taking a good fold, until Artemio understands that Angela is not interested in a stable relationship as that would interfere with her job. Disenchanted and disappointed, Artemio finally resolves to go back to his country town. There, he is welcomed by his long time admirer, Maria Rosa, who has in the meantime grown to a beautiful girl. When Angela unexpectedly visits Artemio, he rejects her in favor of Maria Rosa.

A meal replacement is a drink, bar, soup, etc. intended as a substitute for a solid food meal, usually with controlled quantities of calories and nutrients. Some drinks are in the form of a health shake. Medically prescribed meal replacement drinks include the required vitamins and minerals. Bodybuilders sometimes use meal replacements, not formulated for weight loss, to save food preparation time when they are eating 5 to 6 meals a day. In the European Union, weight-reduction meal replacements intended either to supplement (\\"Meal replacement for weight control\\") or to replace totally (\\"Total diet replacement for weight control\\") normal meals are regulated as to their energy content, the nutrients they must provide, and information and advice on packaging by EU Directive 96/8/EC of 26 February 1996 on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction.EC Directive 96/8/EC on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction For example, a meal replacement must provide between 200 and 400 food calories of energy, of which not more than 30% from fat, and not less than specified amounts for various vitamins and minerals. Labeling information is prescribed, and packaging must provide information such as a statement that the product should not be used for more than three weeks without medical advice. This protects users of meal replacements without other food from inadvertent malnutrition. In the United States, the term \\"meal replacement\\" is not defined in federal Food and Drug Administration regulations, but generally refers to a calorie-controlled, prepackaged product in the form of a bar or beverage (ready to drink or powder), that replaces a regular meal. Meal- replacement products usually provide 200 to 250 calories per serving, are fortified with more than 20 vitamins and minerals at \\"good\\" or \\"excellent source\\" levels and often bear nutrient content claims, such as percent fat free and reduced sugar. Meal replacement products can be regulated as conventional or functional foods. In Canada, meal replacements are regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and must meet minimum calorie, protein and vitamin requirements, causing some American products to be rejected.  In popular culture  Meal replacements have been a regular feature of science fiction, especially the space travel genre, at least since the film Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964) and TV's Lost in Space (1965).  Regulations  = EU = In the EU countries, meal replacements are divided into two categories: food supplements for weight control and preparations that completely replace conventional food for the same purpose. The nutrients that make up the mixtures are regulated by Directive 96/8 / EC of February 26, 1996, \\"About food products intended for use in low-calorie diets to reduce weight\\" EC Directive 96/8/EC on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction. For example, meal replacements should provide between 200 and 400 calories of food energy, of which fats account for no more than 30%, and should contain at least a specified amount of various vitamins and minerals. The label should be an indication of the inadmissibility of use for more than three weeks without consulting a doctor, which protects consumers from accidental malnutrition. = USA = In the US, the concept of \\"meal replacement\\" is not defined by the rules of the Food and Drug Administration. As a rule, this concept refers to controlled-calorie foods marketed as bars, beverages or powders. Meal replacements usually contain from 200 to 250 calories per serving with the addition of 20 or more vitamins and minerals and low fat and sugar. = Canada = In Canada, food substitutes are governed by Canadian food inspection standards and must meet minimum calorie, protein, and vitamin requirements. Therefore, some American products are not allowed to be sold in Canada.The popular American meal replacement brand Soylent was blocked in Canada in 2017 after selling the product there for two years.In 2020, Soylent became available in Canada once more. = Asia = Meal replacements are not strictly regulated in Asia. However, some countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia are stringent on claims meal replacement companies make, relating to health benefits and weight losshttps://www.hsa.gov.sg/health-supplements/overview. Meal replacements have not gained as much popularity as in the USA or Europe, they are largely still only used for clinical cases. Despite this, there have been local start-ups focusing solely on meal replacements. Some prominent companies in the region include Sustenance and Nestle's Optifast.  Effectiveness  There is some evidence that the meal replacement diet are effective for weight loss of obese individuals. Lean body mass is better preserved than with very-low-calorie diets, a related kind of diet but unregulated and potentially with unbalanced and insufficient nutrients formulations. Meal replacements can be used to treat diabetes by maintaining weight loss. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), meal replacement products can be used once or twice a day, in lieu of regular meals, to maintain weight loss for individuals with diabetes. However, that weight loss can only be maintained as long as the individual keeps up with the meal replacement plan. The effects of meal replacements on weight loss for individuals with mental illness, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, are inconclusive.

The Admiral began on April 27, 1941, when the Pennsylvania renamed the eastbound Advance General. Advance General The Advance General was a train operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). It was inaugurated in 1940, and was a second section of the PRRs popular General, and was meant to take the coaches, then only being carried eastbound, and make that train an all-Pullman train. In 1941, it was renamed the Admiral. Admiral The new train was eastbound-only until a year later on April 26, 1942, when the Pennsylvania added a westbound counterpart. The Admiral carried both sleepers and coaches plus a diner. After World War II the Pennsylvania put the Admiral on a 17-hour schedule between Chicago and New York along with the Broadway Limited, Trail Blazer, General and Pennsylvanian. At the time the Admiral carried transcontinental sleeping cars which it exchanged in Chicago with the California Zephyr and other California-bound trains. Mounting losses on its passenger operations led the Pennsylvania to reduce service on the Admiral. From April 29, 1956, onwards the Admiral operated as a local, making more intermediate stops with a longer overall running time. The westbound train ended altogether in 1958. The remaining eastbound Admiral lost its dining car in 1966 and the last of its sleeping cars in 1967, leaving it with mail and express cars, coaches and a snack bar. The eastbound Admiral remained after the merger of the Pennsylvania with the New York Central Railroad as the Penn Central and the train was discontinued on the formation of Amtrak on May 1, 1971.

The park includes a working farm, Dame Farm, and is largely undeveloped with limited recreational opportunities. The Rhode Island Division of Parks and Recreation is headquartered in the former, 22-room Palazzi family farmhouse. The park is named for a canyon-like fissure on the park grounds. History The farm was previously owned by the Steere and Dame families of Johnston. A Steere family cemetery lies within the park. The state purchased the property in 1969 from the Palazzi family, who had preserved the farm in a historic condition that dates back to the 18th century. The park was established to rescue open space in the greater Providence metropolitan area and to preserve part of the state's farming history. A 2005 plan by the state to develop a waterpark at the park was defeated by the citizens of Johnston over traffic concerns. Park plans call for the development of picnic areas and playing fields. Recreation The park is open year-round and features walking trails that provide visitors with opportunities to view the farm, foliage, and wildlife of the park.

She was born in New Orleans, to an African American mother and a white father.Yardley, William (May 29, 2014) \\"Storme DeLarverie, Early Leader in the Gay Rights Movement, Dies at 93\\" in The New York Times. She is remembered as a gay civil rights icon and entertainer, who performed and hosted at the Apollo Theater and Radio City Music Hall. She worked for much of her life as an MC, singer, bouncer, bodyguard and volunteer street patrol worker, the \\"guardian of lesbians in the Village.\\" She is known as \\"the Rosa Parks of the gay community.\\"Luce, James (07/12/2010) \\"Gay Community's Rosa Parks Faces Death, Impoverished and Alone\\" in the Huffington Post. Retrieved 3/22/15  Before Stonewall  DeLarverie's father was White; her mother was African American, and worked as a servant for his family. According to DeLarverie, she was never given a birth certificate and was not certain of her actual date of birth. She celebrated her birthday on December 24. As a child, DeLarverie faced bullying and harassment. She rode jumping horses with the Ringling Brothers Circus when she was a teenager. She stopped riding horses after being injured in a fall. She realized she was lesbian near the age of eighteen. Her partner, a dancer named Diana, lived with her for about 25 years until Diana died in the 1970s. According to friend Lisa Cannistraci, DeLarverie carried a photograph of Diana with her at all times.  Stonewall uprising  A parade banner that says \\"Everybody knows black lesbian female homosexual Storm√© started Stonewall,\\" Europride 2019, Vienna, Austria Fifty years later, the events of June 28, 1969, have been called \\"the Stonewall riots.\\" However, DeLarverie was very clear that \\"riot\\" is a misleading description: At the Stonewall rebellion, a scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs, who may have been Storm√©, was roughly escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon. She was brought through the crowd by police several times, as she escaped repeatedly. She fought with at least four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described by a witness as \\"a typical New York City butch\\" and \\"a dyke-stone butch,\\" she had been hit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness stated, announcing that her handcuffs were too tight. She was bleeding from a head wound as she fought back. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains uncertain (Storm√© has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \\"Why don't you guys do something?\\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon, the crowd became a mob and went \\"berserk\\": \\"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\\" Some have referred to that woman as \\"the gay community's Rosa Parks\\". \\"'Nobody knows who threw the first punch, but it's rumored that she did, and she said she did,' said Lisa Cannistraci, a friend of DeLarverie and owner of the Village lesbian bar Henrietta Hudson. 'She told me she did.'\\" Whether or not DeLarverie was the woman who fought her way out of the police wagon, all accounts agree that she was one of several butch lesbians who fought back against the police during the uprising. The Jewel Box Revue From 1955 to 1969 DeLarverie toured the black theater circuit as the MC (and only drag king) of the Jewel Box Revue, North America's first racially integrated drag revue. The revue regularly played the Apollo Theater in Harlem, as well as to mixed-race audiences, something that was still rare during the era of Racial segregation in the United States. She performed as a baritone. During shows audience members would try to guess who the \\"one girl\\" was, among the revue performers, and at the end Storm√© would reveal herself as a woman during a musical number called, \\"A Surprise with a Song,\\" often wearing tailored suits and sometimes a moustache that made her \\"unidentifiable\\" to audience members. As a singer, she drew inspiration from Dinah Washington and Billie Holiday (both of whom she knew in person). During this era when there were very few drag kings performing, her unique drag style and subversive performances became celebrated, influential, and are now known to have set a historic precedent. In 1987 Michelle Parkerson released the first cut of the movie, Storm√©: The Lady of the Jewel Box, about DeLarverie and her time with the revue. Influence on fashion With her theatrical experience in costuming, performance and makeup, biracial DeLarverie could pass as either a man or a woman, Black or white. Offstage, she cut a striking, handsome, androgynous presence, and inspired other lesbians to adopt what had formerly been considered \\"men's\\" clothing as street wear. She was photographed by renowned artist Diane Arbus, as well as other friends and lovers in the arts community, in three piece suits and \\"men's\\" hats. She is now considered to have been an influence on gender-nonconforming women's fashion decades before unisex styles became accepted. Life after Stonewall  DeLarverie's role in the Gay liberation movement lasted long after the uprisings of 1969. In the 1980s and 1990s she worked as a bouncer for several lesbian bars in New York City. She was a member of the Stonewall Veterans' Association, holding the offices of Chief of Security, Ambassador and, in 1998 to 2000, Vice President. She was a regular at the gay pride parade. For decades Delarverie served the community as a volunteer street patrol worker, the \\"guardian of lesbians in the Village.\\" In addition to her work for the LGBT community, she also organized and performed at benefits for battered women and children. When asked about why she chose to do this work, she replied, \\"Somebody has to care. People say, 'Why do you still do that?' I said, 'It's very simple. If people didn't care about me when I was growing up, with my mother being black, raised in the south.' I said, 'I wouldn't be here.'\\" For several decades, DeLarverie lived at New York City's famous Hotel Chelsea, where she \\"thrived on the atmosphere created by the many writers, musicians, artists, and actors.\\" Cannistraci says that DeLarverie continued working as a bouncer until age 85. In June 2019, DeLarvarie was one of the inaugural fifty American \\"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\\" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.  Illness and death  DeLarverie suffered from dementia in her later years. From 2010 to 2014, she lived in a nursing home in Brooklyn. Though she seemingly did not recognize she was in a nursing home, her memories of her childhood and the Stonewall Uprisings remained strong. On June 7, 2012, Brooklyn Pride, Inc. honored Storm√© DeLarverie at the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture. Michelle Parkerson's film. Storm√©: The Lady of the Jewel Box, was screened. On April 24, 2014, DeLarverie was honored alongside Edith Windsor by the Brooklyn Community Pride Center, \\"for her fearlessness and bravery\\" and was also presented with a proclamation from New York City Public Advocate, Letitia James. She died in her sleep on May 24, 2014, in Brooklyn. No immediate family members were alive at her time of death. Lisa Cannistraci, who became one of DeLarverie's legal guardians, stated that the cause of death was a heart attack. She remembers DeLarverie as \\"a very serious woman when it came to protecting people she loved.\\" A funeral was held May 29, 2014, at the Greenwich Village Funeral Home.
