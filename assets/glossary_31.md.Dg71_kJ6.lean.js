It is part of the Chiltepe pyroclastic shield volcano, one of three ignimbrite shields on the Nicaraguan volcanic front.. The lake at its center, Apoyeque lake (Spanish: Laguna de Apoyeque, also called Laguna de Apoyaque,.), its shore 100 meters below the peak of the caldera, at its bottom reaches down to sea level. Apoyeque, as well as the entire Chiltepe peninsula are part of the Managua administrative region, in close proximity to city of Managua, Nicaragua's capital.. Immediately southeast of Apoyeque peak is the 2.5 × 3 kilometer-wide lake-filled Xiloá (Jiloá) maar, a part of the Apoyeque complex. Volcanology The last eruption of Apoyeque, in about 50 BC (+/- 100 years), was one of the largest explosions known in history, and it had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6. In addition to the Chiltepe dome (volcán Chiltepe), which is used synonymously with Apoyeque, the Apoyeque complex contains the Jiloa caldera (Laguna de Jiloa aka Xiloá), the Miraflores dome and the Cerro Talpetate dome. An eruption of Laguna Xiloá 6100 years ago produced pumiceous pyroclastic flows that overlay similar deposits of similar age from Masaya. Apoyeque has been identified as a particular dangerous volcano, due to its history of major eruptions separated by 2000 years, proximity to Managua, and the risks of generating lake tsunamis.

Its body is up to wide. Description Hermit crabs are usually easy to identify because of the colouration of their antenna and their antennules (a small structure resembling antennae which sits in front of the actual antennae). The hermit crab is approximately about the size of a coin and on average about 56mm in length, but this is slightly limited by the size of the shells available. The crab abdomen is spiral shaped, and can twist and is flexible, so they can fit easily and comfortably into the different shells they take on throughout their life.http://merc.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hermit-Crab.pdf The crab protects and shields itself from predators and potential danger by contracting rapidly back into its shell out of reach, it uses its large chela as a door which protects it once it has retreated back into the safety of its shell. Throughout their lifetime hermit crabs use and adopt empty mollusk and gastropod shells, such as cats eyes, snails and periwinkles to protect their soft and vulnerable abdomens. The crabs carry their shells around on their backs with small legs which are modified so that there back end can grip into the shell, they use their abdominal muscles to hold the themselves securely in place. Over time, as hermit crabs grow they must switch shells to accommodate their expanding bodies as they need to find larger shells for protection. Distribution =Natural global range= The Pagurus novizealandiae has not been identified to naturally occur anywhere else in the world as the species is endemic to New Zealand. =New Zealand range= In New Zealand there are more than 60 known species of hermit crab, predominantly found along the coastline in tidal rock pools and estuaries. Pagurus novizealandiae is mainly found in the intertidal zones right throughout both the North and South Island, however this species is mostly found in the South Island, or on the Auckland Islands 465 km south-east of New Zealand. = Habitat preferences = The Pagurus novizealandiae is found only in marine environments, around rocky intertidal shorelines or rocky sub tidal reefs. This species of hermit crab cannot tolerate high dilution of seawater at all, therefore cannot survive in freshwater habitats. They are generally restricted to areas, usually the estuary where strong tidal activity takes place and the salinity of the water remains continuously high enough to support the crab's requirements. The crab's tidal habitat means that it can be found at depths ranging from low tide to approximately 15m. Life cycle/phenology Moulting is a vital part of the Pagurus novizealandiae life cycle in order to grow and develop, for the repair of any damaged limbs or other body parts on its abdomen and in the process of preparing for reproduction. Moulting has to occur so that the crab can mature, the hermit crab sheds its exoskeleton, while the crab is still inside of the small, enclosed space of its shell. Underneath is its new soft shell, it must wait until this has hardened so that it can protect its abdomen for when it leaves to find a new shell. The hardening and thickening process only takes a few days. After the moult this results in an increase in the hermit crabs size so it must find a larger shell to house its body. There shells also just wear out naturally over time, are damaged by predators or become overgrown. During the searching process there is very high demand for shells as the crabs want to find a new home as quickly as they can so that they are safe from predators. Timing and location is a very important part in determining where to go to undergo the moulting procedure. Both the male and female hermit crab produce inviting sex pheromones. The males are very aggressive during breeding and are known do be quite dominant over the females. The Pagurus novizealandiaes behaviours around the transfer of sperm will be unique to the species but the process will still involve lining up gonopores on the crab's legs and transferring the sperm from the male to female. In terms of egg laying, the female New Zealand hermit crab has two to three pleopods. These carry the fertilised eggs, which are covered in a glue like substance that helps them to stick onto her abdomen. The hermit crab protects the eggs inside of its shell out of dangers reach until the embryo development is fully complete. When the time has come for the eggs to be hatched and released the eggs let off a pheromone that stimulates the female, her movements help to hatch the eggs and they are delivered to the plankton. The larvae take weeks to months to grow, going through several different larval processes until they reach the final stages where they can occupy a small part of a broken snail shell. Eventually they become a juvenile hermit crab and start there hunt for a suitable shell. Diet and foraging Hermit crabs are scavengers, they will forage during the night for dead or injured animals and feed off their remains. They can also be found moving about in rock pools during the day. They sometimes partially bury themselves into the sediment and feed on the organic matter, as well as algae, immobile invertebrates and filtered plankton and food particles. They are detritus feeders and eat a fairly broad and assorted diet. The hermit crab has one large powerful pincer/ claw and one small one. The large pincer is strong enough to rip apart the hard outer parts and armour on some of its prey such as tough fish scales, and skeletons so that it can access the soft fleshy parts within and break them into small enough pieces to eat.http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/getting-involved/students-and- teachers/field-trips-by-region/120-the-hermit-crab-model-study.pdf Its large pincer tends to remove the food then the smaller chela acts as a scoop which collects up the organic or animal material, which is then transported to the mouth with the crabs third maxillipeds (the outermost mouth parts, they hold the food until its ready to be pushed into the mouth). This is because often the larger pincer is too big to complete this process. Hermit crabs sometimes brace themselves over there prey using there walking legs to make it easier to rip pieces of flesh away from the animal. They are real scavengers in the sense that they will try and consume as much as they can in a short period of time before larger scavengers come along and steal their food from them. Predators, parasites and diseases Because the hermit crab lives in the bottom of rock pools and ocean floors, and due to its size, its predator list is long. It is easy prey for the likes of fish, and octopus. Other crabs are also known to eat the smaller and more unprotected species, like the hermit crab, hence the need for shells to protect the soft body. Because the hermit crab \\"sifts\\" through the sediment at the bottom of the ocean, smaller invertebrates are known to utilize this as an opportunity for themselves. Shell trading Hermit crabs display quite interesting behaviours during the shell trading process. The trade usually involves two crabs, they engage in a sort of physical fight probing, rocking and knocking each other's shells around. This type of behaviour gives the crabs the chance to check out the quality and size of one another's shells and actually usually results in both crabs benefitting from the trade. Large numbers of crabs can trade shells at once and it can take place in a very short period of time. Once they have traded it will not take the crab long to decide whether or not the shell is suitable.

It allowed paper documents to be scanned, electronically edited, and then printed on demand. DocuTech systems were the last known to use the XNS protocol for networking. The very first DocuTech system, known as the DocuTech Production Publisher was announced on October 2, 1990. Its 135 page-per minute, black and white, xerographic print engine and attached finisher module were largely based on ones previously developed for the Xerox 5090 Duplicator system (announced by Xerox in 1988). However, image generation in the DocuTech was performed using a digitally driven, dual-beam, Laser ROS (Raster Output Scanner) rather than by the light- lens optics and exposure lamps found in the \\"analog\\" 5090 system. The system's scanner module allowed document scanning in a number of modes including manually from the platen or automatically using a 23 page-per-minute recirculating document feeder. The scanner also had a semi-automatic side feeder which could be used to scan large originals and computer fan-fold (CFF) input. The entire system was controlled by an electronic sub-system (ESS) of a proprietary Xerox design. The ESS incorporated a large number of Xerox proprietary Mesa processors which were specifically designed for high-speed image processing, 32 MegaBytes of RAM, I/O control interfaces for communicating with the Printer and Scanner modules, as well as 3 disk drives which contained system software and space for storing images (including those for saved jobs). With its ability to digitally scan, edit and store documents for later retrieval, and also its ability to output stitched or tape-bound books, the DocuTech Production Publisher was arguably the first fully integrated \\"print-on-demand\\" publishing system. In fact, the Xerox DocuTech line of publishing systems is largely credited with establishing the \\"print- on-demand\\" industry. In late 1991, Xerox re-branded the original DocuTech Production Publisher as the DocuTech Production Publisher Model 135 (DT135). This was done to distinguish it from the DocuTech Production Publisher Model 90 which the company anticipated announcing in 1992. The model numbers were chosen to reflect the page-per-minute print speeds of the two models. The controller and scanner where common for both models, but the Model 90 used a different print engine based on one developed for the previously announced Xerox 4090 printer. The original DocuTech Production Publisher was capable of scanning and then printing black-and-white pages at up to 135 pages per minutes (for letter or A4 sizes) with an output resolution of 600 x 600 dots per inch (dpi). Scanned documents could be saved to a special memory area on disk known as the \\"Save Queue\\" where they could be retained, edited if desired (using the built in editor), and later printed \\"on demand\\". The system was also capable of printing on sheet sizes up to 14x17 inches. Another important feature of this earliest DocuTech was its ability to perform signature imposition and generate \\"2-up signatures\\" (later 4-up was added) in the proper page imposition order to create signature booklets. (note: Folding, trimming, and stitching of booklets was done by an optional accessory known as a C.P. Bourg Signature Booklet Maker or SBM-1, which could be attached in-line to the system's output finisher.) In June 1992 Xerox announced the DocuTech 135 Network Publisher which augmented the earlier DocuTech's capability by enabling it to receive and print documents transmitted over a network. Although this system's network connectivity was limited to Xerox's proprietary XNS network, a DocuTech Network Server was also offered which enabled the now growing family of DocuTech Publishing Systems to be utilized with a broader set of networks. The DocuTech 6135 is an improved version of the DT135, with a Sun Microsystems workstation controller replacing the original controller and scanner. Additional improvements include an optional VLD laser assembly, which uses sub-pixel dot positioning, while not truly increasing the print resolution to 600 x 1200 dpi, improves the halftone quality. The DocuTech system's main competitor in the field of print-on-demand production plant is IBM's InfoPrint system. In addition, there are a number of other competitors in the field, led by the Kodak Digimaster Production Printer, which is sold under a number of different brand names. Xerox retired the original DocuTech 1xx platform in favor of the DocuTech 61xx and Nuvera systems (originally introduced as the DocuTech 100/120 Copier/Printer).

The town was built by the Lőrinci- Rózsaszentmárton highway, not far from the River Zagyva. History Petőfibánya is a small planned city established between 1945 and 1965. Originally there was a small settlement on the site called Pernyepuszta. A coal mine was established in 1942 and exploitation of the local lignite reserves began in October 1945. The settlement was renamed to Pernyebánya that year, and Petőfibánya in 1948 (bánya means \\"mine\\" in Hungarian). The mine was operated by the Petőfi Mining Company that built a power plant in nearby Lőrinci. Petőfibánya was part of Lőrinci until 1989 when it became an independent municipality. The mining company also established a mining machine plant in Petőfibánya. Other industrial activities appeared later. The town was given its present name after the state owned company which bore the name of Sándor Petőfi, the national poet of Hungarians. In the 1950s and 1960s block houses and public buildings were erected in the typical Socialist realist style of the era. Petőfibánya never became an important industrial city because lignite mining halted in the middle of the 1960s. The development of the town came to an abrupt end. The economic consequences of the 1989 change hit Petőfibánya hard. In the 1990s unemployment was more than 30 percent and many people left the town.

The present Act was originally enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia as the Internal Security Act 1960 (No. 18 of 1960), and extended to Singapore on 16 September 1963 when Singapore was a state of the Federation of Malaysia. Before a person can be detained under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention is necessary for the purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA. The ISA also empowers the authorities to prohibit political and quasi-military organizations, ban subversive documents and publications, shut down entertainments and exhibitions that are or are likely to be detrimental to the national interest, and to suppress organized violence by declaring parts of Singapore to be security areas. History and developments British colonial Malaya introduced the Emergency Regulations Ordinance 1948Emergency Regulations Ordinance 1948 (No. 17 of 1948). on 7 July 1948 during the Malayan Emergency in response to a Communist uprising and guerrilla war. The regulations allowed the police to arrest anybody suspected of having acted or being likely to act in a way that would threaten security without evidence or a warrant, hold them incommunicado for investigation, and detain them indefinitely without the detainee ever being charged with a crime or tried in a court of law.. The successor to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance 1955 (\\"PPSO\\"),Preservation of Public Security Ordinance 1955 (No. 25 of 1955) (\\"PPSO\\"). was introduced a result of the 1955 Hock Lee bus riots by the Labour Party government in Singapore. There was strong opposition to the PPSO by the party then in opposition, the People's Action Party (\\"PAP\\"). In 1958, Lee Kuan Yew of the PAP accused the Lim Yew Hock government of using the PPSO to stifle political dissent.. In 1960, three years after Malaya's independence, the Emergency was declared over. However, the Malayan Internal Security Act 1960 (\\"ISA\\")Internal Security Act 1960 (No. 18 of 1960, Malaya) (\\"ISA\\"). was passed in place of the PPSO with much of the same powers. During parliamentary debates on the Act, Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stated that the ISA would only be applied against only the remaining Communist insurgents. The Malayan Communist Party and its insurgents eventually surrendered in 1989. Nonetheless, the ISA was retained in Malaysia. The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling, a British lawyer, author and professor. In 1989, he commented that he \\"could not imagine then that the time would come when the power of detention, carefully and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities\\".. Nonetheless, he commented that he supported review of the ISA but it was not for him to say if the law should be scrapped, as \\"you've got a multi-racial society [in Malaysia] in which emotions can run high very quickly\\".. When Singapore joined the Federation of Malaya in 1963, the Malayan ISA was extended to Singapore. The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965. The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition. (\\"ISA\\"). In September 2011, the debate over whether the ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia announced that it was considering repealing the ISA.. Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the Act would be abolished and replaced by new laws to safeguard peace and order.. Teo Chee Hean, the Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs in the 12th Parliament of Singapore, justified the Internal Security Act in Parliament in October 2011 The legitimacy and relevance of the ISA were subsequently debated by former ISA detainees, the Singapore Government, and others.; . Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris–Punggol Group Representation Constituency, Dr. Janil Puthucheary, commented in Parliament on 18 August 2011 that \\"while he felt it inappropriate to detain a citizen without trial, he is convinced by the hard logic that the safety and security of Singapore must be paramount\\". However, he agreed that there needed to be more safeguards to prevent abuse of the ISA and that \\"the ISA needs to be discussed in a more transparent manner, even as the facts associated with a given detainee need to be kept secret\\".. The following day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean explained the relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations as part of a broader network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.. Opposition political parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished. In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, which allow arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions, should be enacted to replace the ISA.. The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013.. Legislative authority for enactment The legislative authority for the enactment of the ISA is Article 149 of the Constitution of Singapore,. which appears in Part XII (\\"Special Powers against Subversion and Emergency Powers\\").See . Entitled \\"Legislation against subversion\\", Article 149 states: To satisfy the requirements of Article 149(1), the preamble to the Malaysian ISA, which has been retained in Singapore's ISA, contains the following recital: Provisions relating to internal security Part II of the ISA, the first substantive part of the Act, contains provisions relating to internal security.Part I is entitled \\"Preliminary\\" and contains the short title of the Act and an interpretation section. It is divided into six chapters: :I. Prohibition of organisations and associations of a political or quasi-military character and uniforms, etc. :II. Powers of preventive detention. :III. Special powers relating to subversive publications, etc. :IV. Control of entertainments and exhibitions. :V. Other powers for the prevention of subversion. :VI. Miscellaneous. =Prohibition of political or quasi-military organizations= Chapter I of Part II of the ISA empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to take action against political or quasi-military organizations and associations. It is a criminal offence to be a member or adherent of any association of persons who are organized, trained or equipped to enable them to be employed \\"in usurping the functions of the police or of the Singapore Armed Forces\\" or \\"for the purpose of enabling them to be employed for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political or other object, or in such a manner as to arouse reasonable apprehension that they are organised or trained or equipped for that purpose\\". It is a more serious crime to promote or conspire with someone else to promote, or to participate in the control or management of, the association, or to organize or train any member or adherent of the association.ISA, s. 5(1). symbols of Communism – the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle – are prohibited if used in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's interests The Minister is empowered to prohibit any uniform or dress to be worn in public by members or adherents of a political or quasi- military association involved in the activities mentioned in the previous paragraph, or any uniform or dress indicating an association with a political organization or with the promotion of a political object.ISA, s. 3. Wearing such a uniform or dress in contravention of the Minister's order is an offence.ISA, s. 4. In addition, if the Minister considers it to be in the national interest to do, he may prohibit the \\"manufacture, sale, use, wearing, display or possession of any flag, banner, badge, emblem, device, uniform or distinctive dress or any part thereof\\".ISA, s. 7(1). Currently, the only emblem or device that is prohibited is one \\"in the form of a 5-pointed red star or a hammer and sickle in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that the emblem or device was intended or was likely to be used in a manner prejudicial to the interests of Singapore or to promote or foster a purpose prejudicial to or incompatible with peace, welfare or good order in Singapore\\".. It is a crime for a person to be present at or to attend any meeting or assembly organized for the participants to train or drill themselves or to be trained or drilled \\"in the use of arms ... or for the purpose of practising military exercises, movements or evolutions\\". It is also a crime to train or drill other people in these manners or to take part in the control or management of an association whose members are so trained. The prohibition does not apply to members of the Singapore Armed Forces, the police, a legally constituted volunteer or local force, a visiting force lawfully present in the country, or any organization or association exempted by the Minister.ISA, s. 6. =Preventive detention= Chapter II of Part II of the ISA, which allows for preventive detention (also known as detention without trial), is the most conspicuous feature of the Act. It confers on the executive a discretionary power to arrest and detain without trial, when necessary, a person with a view to prevent \\"that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein\\".ISA, s. 8(1)(a). For the purposes of this provision, essential services means services relating to water, electricity, public health, fire, prisons, post, telephony, telegraphy, radiocommunication (including broadcasting and television), ports, docks, harbours, public transport, and the bulk distribution of fuel and lubricants.ISA, s. 8(3) and the 3rd Schedule. Instead of detaining a person for the purposes mentioned above, the executive may impose other restrictions upon the person's liberty such as curfews, requiring the reporting of his or her movements, prohibiting the person from speaking at public meetings or taking part in political activities, and travelling beyond Singapore or any part of the country.ISA, s. 8(1)(b). Procedure =Before detention= A summary of the procedure for preventive detention under the Internal Security Act Before a person can be detained under the ISA, the President must be satisfied that such detention is necessary for the purposes of national security or public order.ISA, s. 8(1). This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention.Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] SGCA 16, [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 525 at 537, para. 30, Court of Appeal (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.ISA, s. 74(a). =Initial detention= Once an individual has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. The detainee is to be informed of the grounds of detention as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest.ISA, ss. 9(a) and (b); Constitution, Art. 151(3). He or she is to be served with a copy of the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made.ISA, s. 11(2)(b). The detainee is also to be informed within 14 days of his or her right to make representations against the order to an advisory board,ISA, ss. 11(1) and 11(2)(a). which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations.ISA, s. 12(1). Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice.Constitution, Art. 151(2). The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced.ISA, s. 14. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretionConstitution, Art. 21(2)(g). whether the detainee should be released.ISA, ss. 12(2) and 13A; Constitution, Art. 151(4). Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.Constitution, Art. 21(4). Non-citizens detained under the ISA do not have a right to make representations to an advisory board., reg. 3. They may, within two months from the date of the detention order, make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court.Essential (Detained Non- Citizens) Regulations, regs. 5–7. The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.Essential (Detained Non-Citizens) Regulations, reg. 8. =Extension and suspension of detention= The initial order of the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an individual be detained for up to two years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time.ISA, s. 8(2). The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a detention order, but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the detention order.ISA, s. 10. Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister.ISA, s. 13. If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release.ISA, s. 13A; Constitution, Art. 151(4). The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens.Essential (Detained Non-Citizens) Regulations, reg. 4. When a detention order is extended, the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension.Emergency (Internal Security and Detention Orders) Regulations 1964 (L.N. 335/64, Malaysia; G.N. Sp. No. S 174/1964, Singapore), reg. 3 (now the , as amended by the Emergency (Internal Security and Detention Orders) (Amendment) Regulations 1965 (L.N. 110/65, Malaysia)); Emergency (Internal Security and Detention Orders) Regulations 1965, reg. 2(a). Scope of judicial review of ISA orders Under administrative law, judicial review is an exercise in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them.; . Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid., citing the following paper by the former Chief Justice of Australia: . With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments. =Before 1988: Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs= Timeline of legal developments concerning the exercise of discretion under the ISA Prior to 1988, the Singapore case of Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971)Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs [1971] SGHC 10, [1971–1973] S.L.R.(R.) 135, H.C. (Singapore), archived from the original on 5 January 2012. was authority for the application of the subjective discretion test for judicial review of executive power exercised under the ISA.Lee Mau Seng, p. 157, para. 60. The subjective test precludes the court from inquiring into the facts and grounds that are relied upon by the executive body in exercising its discretion. It is based on the literal interpretation of the words \\"[i]f the President is satisfied\\" that appear in section 8 of the ISA, such that no more is required than the subjective satisfaction of the President.. This reasoning applies similarly to section 10 of the ISA, which requires the Minister's satisfaction for the suspension of detention orders. =1988–1989: Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs= In the case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal expanded the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion.Chng Suan Tze, p. 545, para. 56. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell within the scope of the purposes specified by the ISA.Chng Suan Tze, p. 556, para. 93. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.Chng Suan Tze, p. 541, para. 39. The subjective test was rejected for several reasons by the Court of Appeal.Chng Suan Tze, p. 568, para. 139. It held that applying the subjective test to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980). to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice.Ong Ah Chuan, p. 722, para. 26. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections 8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article 12(1).Chng Suan Tze, pp. 551–552, paras. 79 and 82. When the case was decided, Article 149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article 12., Art. 149(1). Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test would be consistent with Article 93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts.Chng Suan Tze, p. 553, para. 86. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article 93.Yee, Ho & Seng, p. 96. Further, the Court rejected the subjective test on the basis that \\"the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law\\". The rule of law requires the courts to examine the exercise of discretionary power and ensure that executive power is exercised within its legal limits. The Court of Appeal also held that legal precedents from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported a rejection of the subjective test in favour of the objective test. The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941). and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941).Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs [1942] A.C. 284, H.L. (UK). However, these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected the subjective test applied by the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969),Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia [1969] 2 M.L.J. 129, Federal Court (Malaysia). which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on in support of the subjective test, could no longer be considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978). decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 545–549, paras. 56–70, and pp. 552–553, paras. 83–85; Yee, Ho & Seng, pp. 71–72. Although sections 8 and 10 of the ISA concern matters of national security, the Court held that this concern does not preclude the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983),. the Court of Appeal decided that it is up to the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections 8 and 10.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 554–556, paras. 89–93. =1989 amendments and Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs= Parliament subsequently passed the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989.. They took effect on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Section 8B(1) of the amended ISA provides that the law pertaining to the judicial review of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971, the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided. In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990),Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 347, C.A. (Singapore) (\\"Teo Soh Lung (C.A.)\\"). the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the applicable law governing judicial review in Singapore, thus prompting a return to the subjective test in reviewing the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA.Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), pp. 359–360, paras. 20–21. Teo Soh Lung in 2011. Upon an appeal brought by her, the Court of Appeal held that the 1989 amendments to the Constitution and ISA had reimposed the subjective test for the exercise of discretion under the ISA. The possible inconsistencies the subjective test had with respect to Articles 12 and 93Chng Suan Tze, p. 551, para. 79. of the Constitution were sought to be resolved with the passing of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article 149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles 11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article 149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article 149(3) provided that nothing in Article 93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article 149\\\\. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the subjective test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore. The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also introduced section 8B(2), which is an ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section 8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), p. 367, paras. 43–44. Parliament also introduced into the ISA section 8D, which dictates that the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 is to be applied retrospectively to proceedings instituted \\"before or after\\" 30 January 1989. Article 11(1) of the Constitution states: \\"No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.\\" Though the 1989 amendments to the ISA did not retrospectively introduce any criminal offences, the legislature saw fit to amend Article 149(1) by inserting a reference to Article 11 to forestall any possible arguments on section 8D's inconsistency with the Article. As the Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said in Parliament: \\"The reference to Article 11 is necessary to ensure the retrospective application of the Internal Security (Amendment) Bill is not challenged.\\". The test for judicial review on matters not relating to the ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992),Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 352, H.C. (Singapore). the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. is not dependent on the Minister's subjective satisfaction. Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities.Kamal Jit Singh, pp. 359–360, paras. 21–22. Academic views =Mala fides situations= While the current law in Singapore holds that the Home Affairs Minister's decision is subjective and not judicially reviewable, there is uncertainty whether there are exceptional situations in which the courts may still step in to practice judicial review even though the ISA deals with national security matters. A possible exception is when the Minister's decision was made mala fides, that is, in bad faith. Such decisions would involve the clear abuse of power, such as being \\"detained solely for having red hair or for failing a professional examination or for having acted as a lawyer against the Government\\".Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), p. 356, para. 13. However, the law on this issue is presently unclear. In Lee Mau Seng, the High Court said that mala fides was not a justiciable issue in relation to the ISA. A similar stance was taken in Malaysia in Karam Singh. However, in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in mala fides situations until a case with a mala fides factual situation arises.Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), p. 367, para. 43. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of Malaysian cases reflecting \\"a gradual recognition that ... indicate a retreat from the purely subjective approach\\".Yee, Ho & Seng, p. 91. In response to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng, academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it. One is that the definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith.. In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly (1977),Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1, Court of Appeal (England and Wales). Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is \\"dishonesty\\" and \\"always involves a grave charge\\".Cannock Chase, p. 6. This contrasts with the meaning of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness. Thus, an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts.; Tham, p. 83. =Freezing of the common law= After the 1989 amendments to the Constitution and the ISA, there was academic discourse on the effect of section 8B(1) on the future development of the common law. The amendments merely caused a time warp in the common law, taking it back to 1971. As they did not amount to a codifying or declaratory Act seeking to replace the common law of judicial review, there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng. Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law can indeed continue to change. While the Parliament has the power to turn the clock back, \\"the Parliament is powerless to stop the clock from running\\" and \\"as soon as the clock is placed back in the hands of the judiciary, the hands might race forward again\\".. Such a stance has wide implications: the High Court and Court of Appeal would not be bound by Lee Mau Seng.Tham, p. 24. They could rule that situations involving mala fides are judicially reviewable, or completely re-adopt the legal position stated in Chng Suan Tze. The justification is that \\"if Parliament intended to render judiciary law impossible, it has only to issue its laws in a more detailed shape, so that in the vast complexity of human affairs there may always be at hand a rule sufficiently precise and definite to meet each particular case\\".. =Validity of ouster clause= Another issue that has undergone academic scrutiny is the nature of section 8B(2) as an ouster clause. An ouster clause is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.Leyland & Anthony, \\"Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review: Ouster and Time Limit Clauses, the Prerogative Power, Public Interest Immunity\\", Administrative Law, pp. 392–437 at 392. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal declined to address the constitutionality of section 8B and, in particular, how section 8B(2) should be interpreted. Michael Hor has described the judiciary's reluctance to address these points as \\"an elegant piece of judicial 'kung fu'\\" in which it chose to evade the problem.. In a lecture to law students in 2010, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong commented that, in general, \\"ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Constitution, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the Supreme Court\\", though he expressed no concluded opinion on the matter.. However, it seems unlikely that Article 93 can be relied on to invalidate section 8B(2) since Parliament specifically enacted Article 149(3) to protect the 1989 amendments to the ISA from inconsistency with Article 93.. Tham Chee Ho has opined that where a jurisdictional error of law is involved, judicial review will be available despite the presence of an ouster clause.Tham, p. 82. However, an ouster clause still precludes judicial review of non- jurisdictional errors of law.Leyland & Anthony, p. 210. If this distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law exists, section 8B(2) will preclude judicial review of non-jurisdictional errors of law but not jurisdictional errors. Notably, there is a difference between English and Singapore law as regards this issue. In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992),. Lord Browne-Wilkinson commented that the case of Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968). had the effect of rendering the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law obsolete.Ex parte Page, p. 701. This has limited the effect of ouster clauses in the United Kingdom since all errors of law are considered as jurisdictional. However, the Singapore courts have not yet adopted this legal position, and there are cases indicating that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law still exists.Re Application by Yee Yut Ee [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) 490, High Court (Singapore); Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister of Manpower [1999] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 866, H.C. (Singapore). =Basic features doctrine= The basic features doctrine developed in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala (1973). and Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1980). by the Supreme Court of India rests on the notion that there are certain elements of the nation's constitutional structure which cannot be amended by Parliament.Teo Soh Lung v. Ministry for Home Affairs [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 461 at 475, para. 33, H.C. (Singapore) (\\"Teo Soh Lung (H.C.)\\"). In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the plaintiff argued that the 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law.Teo Soh Lung (H.C.), p. 474, para. 31. The Court rejected the application of the basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, and the fact that the framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of the case.Teo Soh Lung (H.C.), p. 479, para. 47. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), p. 368, para. 44. =Role of the judiciary in national security matters= The courtroom of the Court of Appeal in the Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore There are competing views over the appropriate role of the judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA. A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters. The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit the role of the courts in national security matters.Jayakumar, speech during the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill (25 January 1989), col. 525. In 1989, Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts would effectively be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted. The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters, and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats.Jayakumar, speech during the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill (25 January 1989), col. 470. Tham Chee Ho contends that, based on the objective test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues.Tham, p. 76. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment. Another reason that was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the judiciary was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped to determine whether there are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.Tham, p. 78. Thio Li-ann has opined that the 1989 measures taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate a preference for non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article 149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints should be placed on the wide discretionary powers under the ISA.. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.Chng Suan Tze, p. 554, para. 86. Eunice Chua argues against adopting the subjective test and limiting judicial review to breaches of the procedures stated in the ISA. Her argument is based on the premise that courts should consider notions of substantive democracy in performing their judicial role. Chua argues that in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal should have considered whether there were sufficient safeguards for the protection of detainees after the curtailment of judicial review through constitutional and legislative amendments. She suggests that Article 151, which provides for restrictions on preventive detention, should be read liberally in favour of detainees, bearing in mind the exclusion of fundamental liberties by Article 149\\\\. In her view, the curtailment of judicial review should therefore be rejected, as it does not accord with the \\"spirit\\" of Article 151 of the Constitution which ensures safeguards for detainees.. Conversely, Jayakumar argued in 1989 that judicial review is an inappropriate safeguard in preventing abuse of the detention powers under the ISA in the situation where a dishonest government is in power. He argued that judicial safeguards are illusory because such a dishonest government would \\"pack the courts\\" and appoint judges which would rule in their favour. He regarded the best safeguard to be for voters to elect honest and incorruptible men into the Government.Jayakumar, speech during the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill (25 January 1989), col. 524. Criticisms of preventive detention In 2006, the United States Department of State noted that although the ISA had not been used against the Singapore Government's political opponents for some years, \\"political opposition and criticism remained restricted by the government's authority to define these powers broadly. In the past, occasional government references to speech that it considered 'out-of-bounds' were understood to be implicit threats to invoke the ISA.\\". The Singapore Government itself has regularly raised the need to prevent national security threats from materializing as a justification for preventive detention.Teo Chee Hean, \\"Debate on President's Address\\" (19 October 2011), cols. 61–73. However, there have been suggestions that the criminal law is apt for dealing with this matter as well.. Crimes of accessory liability such as abetment, conspiracy and unlawful assembly in the Penal Code. may apply even if harm has not actualized. Furthermore, restrictions imposed by the Societies Act,. as well as the offences in the Sedition Act,. may be viable alternatives to preventive detention. Preventive detention has been preferred over open court trials, as it has been suggested that the criminal trial could be used as a platform for radicals to publicize their views, and that it might confer the honour of martyrdom on accused persons.Hor, p. 49. However, it has been suggested that an open trial which details the evils of terrorism and the indiscriminate destruction that it causes could educate the public and potentially unite the various communities in the country.. Under the framework of the ISA, detainees are theoretically accorded due process. For instance, detainees have a right to make representations against their detention to an advisory board. However, Article 151(3) of the Constitution prevents any government authority from disclosing any information which would, \\"in its own opinion, be against national interest\\". Therefore, there is no means to compel the authorities to disclose information which may be pertinent for the detainee to make a proper representation to an advisory board, thus compromising due process.Yang, p. 31. Moreover, the secrecy of advisory board hearings has been criticized as it may lead to the public questioning the legitimacy of the hearings, and to an impression that justice has not manifestly been done.Hor, p. 44. Due to the limited form of judicial review available under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately in a manner that cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.Yang, p. 32. Instances of the application of the PPSO and ISA According to The Sunday Times of 28 October 1956, 234 people, including trade union leaders Lim Chin Siong, James Puthucheary and C. V. Devan Nair, were detained under the PPSO as suspected Communist subversives.. On 2 February 1963 Operation Coldstore, a joint Malaysian–Singaporean anti- Communist operation, led to the arrest of 133 people. As of 5 April 1963, 17 were being detained in the Federation of Malaya and 107 in Singapore, while the remaining nine had been released.; see also . On 30 October 1966, Chia Thye Poh, leader of the leftist Barisan Sosialis political party, was detained.. He was subsequently held for 32 years pursuant to the ISA, the last nine of which under forms of house arrest and civil rights restrictions, including confinement on the island of Sentosa. All such restrictions were finally lifted on 27 November 1998.; ; . As of that date, the South China Morning Post referred to him as \\"the world's second longest serving prisoner- of-conscience after South Africa's Nelson Mandela\\".. The Straits Times of 28 May 1976 reported that 50 people allegedly involved in a Communist plot had been arrested. Among them were the playwright and theatre director Kuo Pao Kun, then a secretary for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and his wife Goh Lay Kuan.. Kuo was detained under the ISA for four years and seven months, and his citizenship was revoked. Following his release he was placed under residence and travel restrictions until 1983. His citizenship was reinstated in 1992.. In 1987, in a security operation known as Operation Spectrum, 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals were detained under the ISA. They were accused of being members of a dangerous Marxist conspiracy bent on subverting the government by force and replacing it with a Marxist state.; . The detentions led to, among others, the Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases. Two people were arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities. Of those arrested in 1997, one was a male permanent resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who had used the other person, a female Singaporean, as a collaborator. Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.; ; . From 2001, the ISA was mainly used against al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in Singapore. In December that year, 15 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant group were arrested for involvement in the Singapore embassies attack plot.. JI member Mohamed Khalim bin Jaffar was detained in January 2002 (and later released in September 2011),. and another 21 members were arrested and detained in August 2002.. In February 2006, alleged JI head Mas Selamat bin Kastari was extradited from Indonesia and detained under the ISA.

He was transferred back to Singapore for detention under the ISA on 24 September 2010.; . Between November 2006 and April 2007, four Singaporean JI members were detained under the ISA while one had a restriction order issued against him. In addition, lawyer and lecturer Abdul Basheer s/o Abdul Kader, who radicalized himself by reading extremist propaganda on the Internet, was detained in February 2007 for preparing to engage in militant activities in Afghanistan. He was released on 21 February 2010,; ; ; . but rearrested in September 2012 and detained under the ISA the following month for planning to resume jihadist terrorism against foreign military operations abroad, including leaving Singapore – illegally, if necessary – to do so.; . Full-time National Serviceman Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was detained on 4 April 2010. He was described by the media as self-radicalized, having been deeply influenced by the lectures of Feiz Mohammad and Anwar al-Aulaqi which he had accessed online. Around this time, two other people influenced by al-Aulaqi were placed under restriction orders.; ; . Between January and July 2011, three Muslim radicals were deported to Singapore from other countries and detained. JI members Jumari bin Kamdi and Samad bin Subari were arrested in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively; while Abdul Majid s/o Kunji Mohammad, a member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), was arrested in Malaysia. As of 13 September 2011, there were 17 people on orders of detention, one whose detention had been suspended, and 49 people on restriction orders.. On 7 March 2013, it was mentioned in Parliament that 64 people had been detained under the ISA for activities related to terrorism since 2002. In September 2013, the Singapore media reported that Asyrani Hussaini had been detained in March that year and was the fifth Singaporean to have been influenced by radical ideology he had read online. Asyrani had entered Thailand illegally to take part in the armed insurgency in Southern Thailand, but was arrested and deported to Singapore. Another Singaporean, Mustafa Kamal Mohammad, was placed on a two-year restriction order from September 2013 for being a member of the MILF in the Philippines. Three Singaporean former JI members had their restriction orders lifted; they were Jahpar Osman and Samad Subari, and Abdul Majid Kunji Mohamad who had trained with the MILF.. =Subversive documents= Under Chapter III of Part II of the ISA, the minister responsible for printing presses and publications – currently the Minister for Communications and Information. – is authorized to ban documents and publications that are subversive or otherwise undesirable. For instance, the Minister may prohibit (absolutely or conditionally) the printing, publication, sale, issue, circulation or possession of a document or publication that:ISA, s. 20(1). Such a prohibition order can extend to any past or future issue of a periodical publication, and to other publications which have been issued or appear to have been issued by the publishing house, agency or other source which issued the prohibited publication.ISA, s. 20(2). The proprietor of a prohibited publication can lodge an objection to a prohibition order within a month of the date when the order is published in the Government Gazette to the President, whose decision on the matter is \\"final and shall not be called in question in any court\\".ISA, s. 21. When exercising this discretion, the President is required to follow the advice of the Cabinet.Constitution, Art. 21(1). It is a criminal offence to print, publish, sell, issue, circulate, reproduce or possess a prohibited publication or an extract from it;ISA, s. 22.ISA, s. 23(1). and to import, abet the importation of, or have in one's possession any imported prohibited publication.ISA, s. 24. There is a rebuttable presumption a person knows the contents of a publication and their nature immediately after the publication comes into his or her possession.ISA, s. 23(2). However, it is a defence for a person to demonstrate that the publication was \\"printed, published, sold, issued, circulated or reproduced, as the case may be, without his authority, consent and knowledge, and without any want of due care or caution on his part, and that he did not know and had no reason to suspect the nature of the document or publication\\". The masthead of a 1950s issue of the Russian newspaper Pravda, which is a periodical publication prohibited under the ISA Among the publications that have been interdicted under the Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong, and the Russian political newspaper Pravda.. For prohibited documents, see the . A crime is committed if any person posts or distributes a placard, circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence, counsels disobedience to the law or a lawful order, or is likely to lead to a breach of the peace.ISA, s. 25. Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally, in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.ISA, s. 26. Finally, it is an offence to carry or have in one's possession or under one's control a subversive document.ISA, s. 27(1). A document is deemed to be subversive if, in whole or in part, it has a tendency:ISA, s. 27(3). A document that purports to be a subversive document is presumed to be one until the contrary has been proved, and if it is proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents and the nature of the contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive.ISA, s. 27(4). The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.ISA, s. 27(2). =Control of entertainments and exhibitions= The Home Affairs Minister may, under Chapter IV of Part II of the ISA, order that any entertainment or exhibition be closed if satisfied if it \\"is or is likely to be in any way detrimental to the national interest\\".ISA, s. 33(1)(a). Entertainment is defined by the Act as \\"any game, sport, diversion, concert or amusement of any kind to which the public has or is intended to have access and in which members of the public may or may not take part, whether on payment or otherwise\\", while exhibition \\"includes every display of goods, books, pictures, films or articles to which the public has or is intended to have access, whether on payment or otherwise\\".ISA, s. 2. It is an offence to be the promoter of or a person concerned in the promotion of an entertainment or exhibition held or continued in contravention of an order requiring it to be closed, or the proprietor of the premises on which such an event is held. However, it is a defence to show that the event was \\"promoted or continued without his authority, consent and knowledge and without any want of due care or caution on his part\\".ISA, ss. 33(2) and 39. Alternatively, to ensure that an entertainment or exhibition is not detrimental to the public interest, the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter, every person involved in its promotion, and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held.ISA, s. 31(1). Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence, unless the person involved is able to show he or she was not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution.ISA, ss. 31(2) and 39. The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition, or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister.ISA, ss. 33(1)(c) and 37. To enable the Minister to determine whether an entertainment or exhibition should be banned or allowed to be held subject to conditions, the Minister can require that its promoter, any person involved in its promotion, or the proprietor of the premises on which it is to be held to provide information on the following matters:ISA, s. 30(1). Furnishing false or incomplete information is an offence,ISA, ss. 30(2) and 39. and also entitles the Minister to prohibit an event from being held or direct it to be closed.ISA, s. 33(1)(b). The person providing the information also commits a crime if the event is held in a manner contrary to the information provided.ISA, ss. 30(3) and 39. =Other powers= Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers additional powers on the Minister for Home Affairs to prevent subversion. If a written law confers power on a person, body or authority to appoint people to positions, the Minister can order that he or she be provided with a list of the people from which the appointment will be made, and other information. The Minister can then direct that people whose appointment would be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore shall not be appointed or recruited. Furthermore, no person is permitted to disclose any communication received from the Minister except in the course of official duty.ISA, s. 40. The Minister, if satisfied that a school or educational institution is being used for a purpose detrimental to the interests of Singapore or the public, for instruction that is detrimental to the interests of the public or pupils, or as a meeting-place of an unlawful society, can order that it be closed for a period not exceeding six months at a time. The board of managers or governors of an affected school or educational institution can lodge an objection against an order with the President, whose decision on the matter is final and may not be questioned in any court.ISA, ss. 41(1) and (2). The Minister's power does not extend to places where the teaching \\"is of a purely religious character, or for a purely religious purpose\\".ISA, s. 41(3). Faculty of Law of the National University of Singapore. Under the ISA, people can be required to obtain certificates of suitability for admission to institutions of higher learning. A person who requires a certificate of suitability for admission to an institution of higher education must apply to the Director of Education, who must not issue a certificate if \\"there appear to him to be reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant, if admitted to the institution in question, would be likely to promote, or otherwise participate in, action prejudicial to the interests or security of Singapore or any part thereof\\".ISA, s. 42(2). A person who does not hold a certificate of suitability may not be admitted to an institution of higher learning as a student.ISA, s. 42(1). A person who has been refused a certificate may appeal to the Home Affairs Minister, whose decision on the matter is final and cannot be called into question in any court.ISA, ss. 42(3) and (4). The Minister can forbid pupils, students, teachers or members; any class of pupils, students, teachers or members; or any named pupil, student, teacher or member of any school, college, educational institution or students' union or association situated or established outside Singapore to enter into or travel within Singapore as a group unless they first obtain permission from the police to do so. An individual pupil, student, teacher or member can also be barred from Singapore if he or she intends to carry out within the country some common object of the group to which he or she belongs.ISA, s. 43(1). The police can grant permission for such travel subject to conditions.ISA, s. 43(2). If there is a reason for the Commissioner of Police to believe that any person:ISA, s. 43(3)(a). or any person has breached any conditions imposed,ISA, s. 43(3)(b). the Commissioner can require that the person leave Singapore within a certain time and remain abroad for six months or a lesser period; or take the person into custody and remove him or her from Singapore, whereupon the person must remain out of Singapore for six months.ISA, ss. 43(i) and (ii). Failure to comply with any order by the Minister or a breach of the conditions of any permission to travel to Singapore is an offence.ISA, s. 43(4). The above provisions do not authorize the removal from Singapore of any citizen of Singapore ordinarily resident in the country.ISA, s. 43(5). The Constitution, Art. 13(1), states: \\"No citizen of Singapore shall be banished or excluded from Singapore.\\" Provisions relating to security areas Part III of the ISA deals with security areas. Section 48, which is the only provision in Chapter I of Part III, empowers the President, acting on the Cabinet's advice, to proclaim any area in Singapore a security area if in his opinion public security in the area \\"is seriously disturbed or threatened by reason of any action taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside Singapore, to cause or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear organised violence against persons or property\\" and \\"he considers it to be necessary for the purpose of suppressing such organised violence\\".ISA, s. 48(1). A proclamation of a security area must be published by the Home Affairs Minister in any way that the Minister thinks necessary for bringing it to the notice of all persons who, in the Minister's view, should have notice of it. It comes into effect once notice has been given, even if it has not yet been published in the Government Gazette.ISA, s. 48(3). Proclamations are required to be published in the Government Gazette and presented to Parliament as soon as possible after they have been made: s. 48(4). A proclamation remains in force until the President revokes it or Parliament annuls it by passing a resolution.ISA, s. 48(2). =Preservation of public security= Chapter II of Part III of the ISA empowers the Minister to take various steps to preserve public security. Within a security area, the Minister may declare areas to be danger areas, controlled areas or protected places. No person is allowed to enter or remain in a danger area unless escorted by a member of a security force, and to enforce this prohibition security forces can take all necessary measures, including those that are \\"dangerous or fatal to human life\\".ISA, ss. 49(3) and (4). A person who is injured while in a danger area unlawfully cannot make any legal claim for it, though compensation may be awarded if a compensation board thinks it is equitable to do so.ISA, s. 49(5); . The declaration of an area as a controlled area enables the Minister to order that people within the area may only reside within that portion of the area declared to be the \\"residential part\\", and that they may not venture beyond the residential part during certain hours. Failure to comply with such orders is a criminal offence.ISA, ss. 50(1)–(3). An order relating to a controlled area does not apply to the President, members of security forces acting in the course of their duty, or persons exempted from the order by the Commissioner of Police or the officer in charge of the division which the controlled area is in: s. 50(4). Hill Street. These premises were declared to be a protected place under the rather than the ISA.See the , the Schedule, para. 1. If the Commissioner of Police is of the view that it is \\"necessary or expedient in the interests of public security or order, for the maintenance of supplies or services essential to the life of the community, that special precautions should be taken to prevent the entry of unauthorised persons\\", he may declare a place or premises within a security area to be a protected place. While such a declaration is in force, no person is permitted to enter or remain in the place without the permission of the authority or person stated in the declaration.ISA, s. 51(1). Persons wishing to enter a protected place must submit to being searched by police officers and other authorized persons,ISA, s. 51(3). Under s. 51, a police officer includes a member of the security forces, a prison officer, and any person authorized by the Commissioner of Police to be a guard or watchman in a protected place: s. 51(8). and must comply with directions concerning their conduct.ISA, s. 51(2). A failure to do so can result in their removal from the protected place.ISA, s. 51(4). It is an offence to be present in a protected place without permission, and to wilfully fail to stop after being challenged by a police officer or unlawfully refuse to submit to a search.ISA, s. 51(5). The Commissioner of Police can take steps that he considers necessary to secure a protected place, including those that endanger the life of anyone entering the place. If the Commissioner employs such steps, he must take precautions (including displaying prominent warning notices) that he considers reasonably necessary to prevent accidental entry into the place. Once such precautions have been put in place, if any person enters the protected place without permission and is injured or killed, he or she is not entitled to receive any compensation or damages.ISA, ss. 51(6) and (7). The Minister can declare any fence or barrier surrounding a part of a security area to be a perimeter fence. (\\"ISGR\\"), reg. 3(1). The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area.ISGR, reg. 3(6). If anyone is injured or dies as a result of a defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid.ISGR, reg. 3(9). It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.ISGR, regs. 3(5) and (7). In the interests of public safety, the Minister can make a \\"clearance order\\" concerning land that is within of any railway, public road or perimeter fence within a security area, or land in a security area that is \\"used for or in connection with the cultivation of rubber, oil palm, gutta-percha, coconut, bananas or any other fruit growing on trees, or any other agricultural or food crops\\". Such an order directs the owner or occupier of the land, their agent, or any person living in the area surrounded by a perimeter fence to clear away \\"all herbage, bush and undergrowth and any other object mentioned in the order, other than permanent buildings\\", prevent the undergrowth from growing higher than , and maintain the cleanliness of the land.ISGR, reg. 4(1). Failure to comply with a clearance order is a criminal offence.ISGR, regs. 4(5) and (7). The officer in charge of a police division that forms part of a security area can do the following: *Exclusion of persons. Give a written order excluding any person or persons from the police division.ISA, s. 52. *Curfew. Impose a curfew on specified persons, designating that they stay indoors or within a particular area between certain hours, unless they obtain a permit to the contrary issued by a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant.ISA, s. 53(1). Such an order does not apply to the President, a member of the security forces acting in the course of his or her duty, or any person or class of persons exempted from the order by the Commissioner of Police or the office in charge of the police division: s. 53(2). *Control of roads. Regulate, restrict, control or prohibit the use of a road or waterway by any person or class of persons; or any vehicle or vessel, or type or description of vehicle or vessel.ISA, s. 56(1). The officer in charge may authorize another person to exercise this power. In addition, can issue permits to regulate, restrict, control or prohibit persons or classes of persons from travelling in any bus, car, train or other vehicle, or in a vessel.ISA, s. 56(2). A police officer or member of the security forces who is of or above the rating of leading rate or rank of non-commissioned officer and on duty, or a person authorized by the officer in charge of a police division, is empowered to seize any rice or other food if, because of its quantity or situation, it \\"is likely to or may become available to any persons who intend or are about to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or to the maintenance of public order\\".ISA, s. 57(1). In support of this power, people, premises, vehicles and vessels can be searched without a warrant.ISA, ss. 57(2)–(4). If it appears to the Minister to be \\"necessary or expedient ... in the interests of public security, or for the accommodation of any security forces\\", he or she may take possession of any land or building (or part of a building) in a security area.ISA, s. 54(1). The provision also allows the Minister to give directions that appear necessary or expedient in connection with the taking of possession of the land or building. Police officers are permitted to use reasonable force when effecting the taking of possession,ISA, s. 54(2). and the Minister can require the owner or occupier of the land or building to provide information relating to it.ISA, s. 54(4). Once the land or building is in the Minister's possession, he or she has wide power to determine how to use it. The Minister is entitled to disregard any legal restrictions on how it may be utilized, authorize other persons to do with the property anything which the owner or occupier is entitled to do, and ban or limit anyone from exercising rights of way over, and other rights relating to, the land or building.ISA, s. 54.(3). Anyone who feels aggrieved by the Minister taking possession of land or a building can lodge an objection with an advisory committee. The committee is required to consider the objections and any grounds against the objections put forward by the person given possession of the property, and make recommendations to the Minister.ISA, ss. 54(5)–(7). The Minister can give \\"such directions [on the recommendations] as he may think fit\\",ISA, s. 54(8). and award compensation.ISA, s. 69. If a building or structure in a security area is left unoccupied due to an order relating to the security area, and the officer in charge of the police division in which the building or structure is situated takes the view that it may be used by \\"any person or persons who intend, or are about, to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or by any other person who is likely to harbour any such persons\\", and it is not practical to prevent such use, the officer can authorize the destruction of the building or structure. Compensation is payable for such destruction to a person if he or she can demonstrate to the Minister that the building or structure was constructed with the consent of the person lawfully entitled to the land on which it stood, and it was not liable to be forfeited. Even if the building or structure was subject to forfeiture, the Minister can still pay compensation to the owner or occupier if the latter person can prove that it was used by persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public security or for harbouring such persons without his or her knowledge or consent, and that he or she exercised due diligence to ensure that the building would not be used in this manner.ISA, s. 55(2). =Offences= Chapter III of Part III of the ISA creates a number of criminal offences relating to security areas. Firearms, ammunition and explosives It is an offence to carry, or have in one's possession or under one's control in a security area without lawful excuse, any firearm, ammunition or explosive without lawful authority. The penalty for the offence is death.ISA, s. 58(1). No bail may be granted to any person charged with the offence: s. 58(4). The onus is on the person charged to prove that he or she has a lawful excuse for having the item, and this can only be done by demonstrating that he or she acquired the item in a lawful manner for a lawful purpose, and did not act \\"in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order\\" while in possession of or having control of it.ISA, s. 58(3). Furthermore, the person charged has lawful authority to have the item only if he or she:ISA, s. 58(2). *is a police officer, member of the security forces, or person employed in the Prisons Department, and has the item in connection with the performance of his or her duty; *is licensed, or authorized without a licence, to have the item; or *has been granted an exemption by an officer in charge of a police division, or is a member of a class of persons exempted by the Commissioner of Police. However, even if any of the above situations applies to a person, he or she will not be regarded as having lawful authority if he or she has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. In Liew Sai Wah v. Public Prosecutor (1968),. the appellant was arrested at the Singapore train station for having six grenade bodies in his bag. He was charged and found guilty of possession of ammunition by the High Court, and sentenced to death. The conviction was upheld by the Federal Court of Malaysia (then part of Singapore's court hierarchy). However, on further appeal to the Privy Council, their Lordships held that grenade bodies did not come within the term ammunition,Liew Sai Wah, p. 12, para. 16. which was defined as \\"ammunition for any fire-arm as hereafter defined and includes grenades, bombs and other like missiles whether capable of use with such a fire-arm or not and any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any noxious liquid, gas or other thing\\".This is still the definition of ammunition in the current version of s. 2 of the ISA. Counsel for the Public Prosecutor suggested that grenade bodies might fall within the definition of explosive, which includes \\"any material for making an explosive and any apparatus, machine, implement or material used or intended to be used or adapted for causing or aiding in causing any explosion in or with any explosive, and any part of any such apparatus, machine or implement\\".ISA, s. 2. However, the Privy Council declined to allow this submission as it involved the presentation of a case completely different to the one that the appellant was required to meet during his trial and the appeal before the Federal Court. The appellant was therefore acquitted.Liew Sai Wah, pp. 12–13, paras. 17–21. It is a crime, while in a security area, to consort with or to be found in the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment.ISA, s. 59(1). It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years.ISA, s. 59(2). If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.ISA, s. 59(3). Supplies It is an offence for a person, whether inside or outside a security area, to demand, collect or receive suppliesDefined in the ISA, s. 2, as including \\"ammunition, explosives, firearms, money, food, drink, clothing, medicines, drugs or any other stores, instruments, commodities, articles or things whatsoever\\". from another person under circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that:ISA, s. 60(1). *the first person intends or is about to act, or has recently acted, in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order; or *the supplies are intended for someone who intends or is about to act, or has recently acted in such a manner, or are for a terrorist to use.According to the ISA, s. 2, a terrorist is any person who \\"(a) by the use of any firearm, explosive or ammunition acts in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or to the maintenance of public order or incites to violence or counsels disobedience to the law or to any lawful order; (b) carries or has in his possession or under his control any firearm, ammunition or explosive without lawful authority therefor; or (c) demands, collects or receives any supplies for the use of any person who intends or is about to act, or has recently acted, in a manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order.\\" It is also an offence, inside or outside a security area, to be found in possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for,ISA, s. 60(2). or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person, in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above.ISA, s. 60(3). The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence. Other offences A person inside or outside a security area who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA, or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist, but who fails to report the matter to a police officer, commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years. However, if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence, he or she will not be convicted.ISA, s. 61. It is also an offence to attempt to commit an offence under Part III;ISA, s. 62. to assist someone that one knows or has reasonable cause to believe has committed an offence to prevent, hinder or interfere with that person's arrest, trial or punishment;ISA, s. 63. or generally to contravene or fail to comply with any provision of Part III or any order made, direction given or requirement imposed under Part III, or to abet any contravention or failure by another person.ISA, s. 64. Miscellaneous provisions The final part of the ISA, Part IV, contains various miscellaneous provisions. Some notable provisions are described in this section. A police officer is entitled to use such force as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances, including lethal weapons:ISA, s. 75(1). *to arrest a person subject to a detention order; *to arrest a person in respect of whom the officer has reason to believe that there are grounds justifying his or her preventive detention, or that he or she has acted or is about to act or is likely to act in a manner prejudicial to national security; *to arrest a person suspected of having committed an offence under the ISA, the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act,, ss. 3–5. or sections 435 or 436 of the Penal Code which criminalize the commission of mischief by fire or an explosive substance to damage property or destroy a building;ISA, s. 75(1)(c) and the 1st Schedule. *to overcome forcible resistance by a person to such an arrest; or *to prevent an arrested person from escaping or being rescued from arrest. A person who has been arrested for any of the offences mentioned above must, as soon as possible after arrest, be \\"clearly warned of his liability to be shot at if he endeavours to escape from custody\\".ISA, s. 75(2). In addition to a police officer, the power to use force can be exercised by a member of the security forces, any guard or watchman in a protected place, and any person authorized by the Commissioner of Police.ISA, s. 75(3). Provisions exist in the ISA to make it easier to admit statements made by people charged with offences under the Act or certain offences under other laws specified in the Second Schedule to the Act.The laws are the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, the , the , the Sedition Act and the Societies Act. Abetments of or attempts to commit offences under those Acts are also included: ISA, 2nd Schedule. A statement is admissible in evidence in a trial and, if the person who made the statement chooses to testify during a trial, it may be used in cross-examination and to impeach his or her credit, \\"whether the statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant and whether or not interpreted to him by any other police officer or any other person concerned, or not, in the arrest\\".ISA, s. 76(1). This is subject to two limitations:ISA, ss. 76(1)(a) and (b). *A statement is not admissible \\"if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against that person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give that person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him\\". *If a statement has been made by a person after being arrested, it is only admissible if the court is satisfied that a caution along the following lines was administered: \\"It is my duty to warn you that you are not obliged to say anything or to answer any question, but anything you say, whether in answer to a question or not, may be given in evidence.\\" However, if a person makes a statement before there is time to administer a caution, the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible. Once a person has been cautioned, he or she has a right to remain silent and is not required to answer any questions.ISA, s. 76(2).

The entry won that representation by an absolute majority, winning the 20% televote, 20% SMS vote, 20% pre-vote and the 40% jury vote. Teapacks had been selected as the Israeli representative by the Israel Broadcasting Authority and invited to perform four songs at the national final to determine which one would be performed in Helsinki. Style and lyrics The song is an up-tempo number, featuring many changes in tempo and style. Lead singer Kobi Oz begins by singing in English over a steady accordion beat, explaining that \\"The world is full of terror\\" and singing about the risk posed by \\"some crazy rulers\\" who are bent on destruction. At this point, the song moves to the chorus, featuring a guitar riff and the repeated phrase \\"They're gonna push the button\\". The second verse begins in a similar style to the first, with the exception that the lyrics are delivered in French. Oz sings that there is \\"too much violence\\" due to the fanatics he described earlier. The accordion beat is then replaced once again as Oz switches back to English to sing that he does not want to die and that \\"I wanna see the flowers bloom/Don't wanna go kaput kaboom\\" in a more dramatic manner. The chorus (complete with guitar riff) is then repeated (with \\"He's gonna...\\" instead of \\"They're gonna...\\"). Following the chorus, the song changes tempo entirely, as Oz begins to rap in Hebrew. He expands on his earlier description of the risk of fanaticism, describing a nightmarish situation in which nobody else seems aware of, or concerned about, what is happening. The tempo then switches back to the steady beat of the earlier verses, but with Oz still singing in Hebrew describing the people in his situation as \\"pawns\\". He switches further to his dramatic vocals, wondering if perhaps the song is altogether \\"too sharp\\", and suggesting that \\"We should sing palm tree songs, desert songs with no flags\\", referring to an older, romantic (and apolitical) style of Israeli song. The next line -- \\"Ani od khay, khay, khay\\" (\\"I'm still alive, alive, alive\\") -- is a direct quote of the hook from Israel's upbeat (and apolitical) second-place-winning 1983 Eurovision entry, \\"Khay\\". But this quote, exuberant and triumphant in Khay, here is (perhaps slyly) repurposed as just part of the nervous narrator's thought-- \\"I'm still alive, alive, alive\\" it begins, then concludes (no longer apolitical), \\"And if the situation remains as frightening as it has been, only then I will say / I'm gonna push the button\\" (i.e. \\"I'm gonna push the button\\" in the final chorus, a response to \\"They're gonna push the button\\" (in the first chorus) and \\"He's gonna push the button\\" (in the second chorus) ). The politically charged lyrical content caused some controversy. While the message of the song is unclear, some suggest that the song is a reflection of the anxiety of some Israelis about the threat of nuclear war with Iran. This interpretation assumes that the lyrics \\"He's gonna push the button\\" refer to the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Despite earlier statements that it had an inappropriate message and might be banned from the 2007 contest, Eurovision Song Contest organizers approved the Israeli entry.Associated Press (March 14, 2007) Eurovision song organizers approve \` Push the Button ,' this year's contested Israeli entry. The song (and the controversy) was reported in BBC News due to its content.Eurovision 'Armageddon' in Israel, BBC News, 2007-02-28 As Israel had not finished the previous Contest in the top 10, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed second, following Bulgaria's Elitsa Todorova and Stoyan Yankoulov with \\"Water\\" and preceding Cyprus' Evridiki with \\"Comme Ci, Comme Ça\\". At the close of voting, it had received 17 points, placing 24th in a field of 28 and thus missing out on qualification for the final and requiring Israel to qualify through the semi- final at the next Contest.Burstein, Nathan. (May 13, 2007) Jerusalem Post. Teapacks fails to push button in Eurovision semifinals. Section: News; Page 3.  Commercial releases  There are three commercial releases of the song in Israel with various B-sides. The first is a promotional CD called \\"Kdam Erovizyon 2007\\" with the B-sides \\"Salaam Salami\\", \\"12 Points\\", \\"Voulez Vous\\" and \\"Yoshvim bebeit kafe\\" (the title track from their 2001 album), distributed to Eurovision selectors. The second was also a promotional release, with the B-sides \\"Money Trees Forever\\" (an English version of the track \\"Hora nadlanim\\" from the group's then-recent album Radio/Musika/Ivrit) and \\"Croque Madame Croque Monsieur\\". The third was a commercial CD single with the instrumental and vocal tracks as separate B-sides. During Kobi Oz' solo career and after Teapacks' reunion, the song's arrangement was changed: it was played in C instead of A and the Hebrew-language rap was instead read out as a spoken word piece before the beginning of the song.

Synopsis The book presents readable and often humorous descriptions of the Krupp family and its businesses from the Thirty Years' War to the Kaisers, the Weimar Republic, the Nazis, the American occupation, and finally the Bonn government. The book describes how the family and its business received generally favorable treatment from the government, culminating in a special law Lex Krupp. Manchester's book describes family members in detail from the first Krupp (circa 1500) \\"a shrewd chandler with a keen eye for the main chance,\\" through the family's incarnation by the sixth generation as \\"Essen's uncrowned kings,\\" to the powerful weapons company that armed Germany for three major wars, and finally the dissolution of the business. Manchester biases his story; he describes every member as having some unfortunate trait, and all as somewhat malevolent. Review, Horne, Alistair. New York Times Book Review, Kirkus Reviews (Nov. 25th, 1968) The book examines to what extent German industry has part of the moral responsibility for the acts of the German state during the World War II. Krupp profited directly from requisitions of industrial capacities in occupied Europe. The Nazi war effort created a huge demand for workers in the armament industry; a mobilization of women into the labor force was ruled out due to ideological reasons. Instead the Nazis opted to meet the demand for workers by slave laborers. The Krupp AG owned private concentration camps and leased slaves from the SS at the cost of one Reichsmark per day; Slaves for the industry were transferred directly from extermination camps or from POWs, were drafted during the Nacht und Nebel program, or civilians recruited from occupied countries as ostarbeiters. The surviving former slaves were not compensated adequately after the war for their sufferings; after the war Alfried Krupp was convicted of crimes against humanity  Critical response  Time Magazine gave the book a mixed review stating: > The result is an often flawed, some times naive but largely fascinating > chronicle whose inflated pretensions as a work of real scholarship are > punctured by swarms of errors. As a work of history, the book is marred, > too, by an overwrought style and an unbecomingly snide use of irony. > Manchester is not fond of the Germans, and he caricatures them either as > superefficient and slavishly obedient or as a folk barely removed from > dwarfs and dragons, blood feuds and bags of tainted gold.

More recently, their track \\"General Davis\\" was featured in the opening credits of Jonathan Demme's 2004 film, The Manchurian Candidate. History The group was founded in 1977 at St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Comprehensive by Paul McLaughlin, David Maguire, Greg Maguire, and Tom Robinson, whose ages at the time ranged from 12 to 15.Ogg, Alex (2006) No More Heroes: a Complete History of UK Punk from 1976 to 1980, Cherry Red Books, , p. 430-1 While their instruments were basic - including a cardboard drum kit - they were able to quickly produce a demo tape which they sent to a local indie label Fast Product, who also produced the Human League. Inspired by The Slits and Mekons, the Prats debuted with three tracks on the Fast EP Earcom 1. In 1979, the band recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. Peel also offered his fee from a DJing appearance in Edinburgh to finance a single release by the band. A series of singles then followed, including \\"General Davis\\" and \\"Die Todten Reyten Schnell,\\" which was released on a German indie label. A number of line- up changes saw Elspeth McLeod joining to provide additional guitar (including on the single \\"General Davis\\") and Jeff Maguire taking over bass duties from Tom Robinson. In 1980, the EP \\"The 1990s Pop\\" was released on Rough Trade Music. This record contained four tracks: \\"Disco Pope\\", \\"Nothing\\", \\"TV Set\\", and \\"Noboty Noticed\\". \\"Disco Pope\\" received significant airplay under John Peel and was re-released in 2003 on Rough Trade Shops' compilation CD Post Punk Volume 1. The end of school in 1981 meant the end of the Prats. Paul McLaughlin was quoted as saying “Bands are like marriages between four people. You just stop getting on with each other.” McLaughlin, now living in Chelmsford, has released one solo single, \\"Party Girl\\". He has since then given up on music and is currently an employment law executive with Acas; Dave, Jeff, Greg, Tom and Elspeth all live in the Edinburgh area. Sadly, Jeff Maguire (guitarist) passed away from stage 4 cancer in July. One of his last days was spent with his band singing ‘Disco Pope’. He had a wonderful life and will be missed, remembered, and forever loved. The Manchurian Candidate soundtrack With the appearance of the song \\"General Davis\\" on the soundtrack of Jonathan Demme's 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate, starring Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, there has been a resurgence of interest in the Prats, resulting in the release of a compilation CD, Now That's What I Call Prats Music released by One Little Indian in 2005.

He also played in the Canadian Football League for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1964 and 1965. Hackbart initially focused on baseball. He spent a season playing baseball for the Grand Forks Chiefs; a Class C minor league team in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Bud Grant convinced Hackbart to drop baseball and concentrate on a career in the National Football League.Bud Grant On Losing 4 Super Bowls Hackbart was drafted by the Minnesota franchise in the inaugural 1960 American Football League Draft as a quarterback and \\"territorial selection.\\" He was drafted in the fifth round of the 1960 NFL draft as a generic \\"back\\" by the Packers. As Minnesota would never play in the AFL (the group instead joined the NFL as the Minnesota Vikings), Hackbart joined the Packers. Hackbart would eventually join the Vikings in 1966, by this point solely as a defensive back. In 1973, Hackbart was involved in an on-field transgression that he eventually took to court. He asserted that a late hit by Cincinnati Bengals running back Boobie Clark was an intentional tort. He was with the Denver Broncos and was their starting safety in 1973. In the first 1973 regular season game against the Cincinnati Bengals Hackbart's neck was fractured. \\"It was just before halftime and the Bengals had the ball at around the 45 yard line going in. Boobie Clark came out of a split backfield and ran down the hash marks. I was playing free safety so I dropped back to the center of the field. The ball went up in the air and I converged into the endzone. Billy Thompson, who was playing left corner for the Broncos, jumped in front of me and Boobie Clark and intercepted the pass. I tried to block Boobie and landed on the ground. When I came up on to one knee watching Thompson run the ball, Boobie came up from behind me and whacked me in the back of the head, with a right fore-arm and drove me into the ground, after the Play was finished. My left arm went numb ! At halftime in the locker room I couldn’t take off my helmet so I was packed in ice around my neck and helmet.\\" Hackbart did not at the time report the happening to his coaches or to anyone else during the game. However, because of the pain which he experienced he was unable to play golf the next day. He did not seek medical attention, but the continued pain caused him to report this fact and the incident to the Bronco trainer who gave him treatment. Apparently he played on the specialty teams for two successive Sundays, but after that the Broncos released him on waivers. (He was in his thirteenth year as a player.) He sought medical help and it was then that X-rays were taken, which revealed that the C4, 5, 6, and 7 vertebrae on his neck were fractured. This injury ended his football career. In 1974 neurosurgeons told Hackbart that if he didn't have surgery to repair the damage, he would lose use of his left arm, shoulder, and any muscles involved with the damaged vertebrae. The Broncos claimed they were not liable. Hackbart hired an attorney, Rodger Johnson of Johnson & Mahony, and brought a suit against the Bengals. Hackbart v. the Cincinnati Bengals became a precedent setting case. In the case the courts ruled that in the course of a professional football game an intentional infliction of an injury by one player upon another might constitute a tort. As a result of the lawsuit, the National Football League mandated that all stadiums had to be equipped with X-ray machines. The head slap maneuver which injured Hackbart was banned. Later, rules against spearing with the helmet and helmet to helmet contact were created. Hackbart settled with the Bengals and the Broncos filed a Workman's Compensation claim which paid for the surgery that was performed in 1976. The case was eventually appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1979 and has become a key point of discussion in several first year law school tort classes. Hackbart v.

Their friend, Emmett, is preparing the props to scare Jessie when he and his dog, Dutchess, are attacked by a ghost. Meanwhile, Allan is searching for his sister, Meg, who went missing with her friend, Kathleen, in the hospital a few days ago. His father's old friend, former actor-turned-cop Arlo Ray Baines, initially refuses his plea to accompany him to the hospital, but changes his mind and trails him anyway. Allan finds Dutchess horribly mutilated, but she suddenly rises up and attacks him until he shoots and blows her to bits. Upon entering the third floor, he reunites with Meg, who says that she got separated from Kathleen. Arriving at the hospital, the four friends begin searching for Emmett. When they are alone, Kevin cheats on Jessie by having sex with Marie. Meanwhile, Jessie, who is revealed to be spiritually aware, tells Freddy the story of her late mother, who died due to disease years ago but is still calling her every Halloween. The two stumble upon a terrified Emmett in the locker room. When the five meet up, Emmett suddenly begins attacking them. Allan and Meg arrive in time and Meg uses Allan's gun to shoot Emmett to bits. She tells the group that everyone who die in the hospital are reanimated; Emmett and Dutchess are among them. A paranoid Kevin, suspecting that Marie is becoming a ghost, grabs Allan's gun and shoots her dead. Since Meg refuses to use the elevator, the group split up, with Jessie, Kevin, and Freddy taking Marie's body to the elevator and Allan and Meg using the stairs. The former three are transported to the third floor, where Jessie has a series of premonitions involving a child murderer named Jacob. Jacob was committed to the hospital's third floor that was specifically reserved for mental patients. Despite this, he managed to murder a little girl in the hospital's premises anyway. When he tried to run away by burning the hospital as distraction, Nurse Russell threw away the door keys, trapping both of them in the fire. Jacob has been killing and reanimating people in the hospital so he can possess them, but all have failed so far. While inspecting the floor, Kevin goes missing. Jessie and Freddy reunite with Allan, Meg, and Arlo, who has killed a reanimated Kathleen and decided to save them all. They find Kevin trapped by the little girl's spirit and manage to free him, but in the process, Freddy is revealed to have died and was reanimated, forcing Arlo to shoot him. The rest try to escape through the stairs, however, Jessie eventually realizes that until they are able to beat Jacob, he will never allow them to leave. To do it, she impersonates Nurse Russell, intending to scare him from the living world. The plan works. Nevertheless, Jacob uses a reanimated Marie to kill Kevin. Kevin is reanimated, but shows no symptom of a normal ghost. It is revealed that he is directly possessed by Jacob, who finds Kevin, a sociopath, to be a perfect vessel. At the same time, Meg shows herself to be a reanimation; she had died alongside Kathleen back then. However, she is possessed by Russell and retains her control. Russell tells the group to leave while she confronts and successfully subdues Jacob. Jessie, Allan, and Arlo leave the premises safely, finding out that it is already the noon of All Saint's Day outside. Back at the hospital, Jacob vows to escape, but Russell casually states that he will have to get through her first before turning off the lights. Cast *Trish Coren as Jessie Holden *M.

Plot summary  Set in puritan Kent in 1657, the story focuses on the intrigues of Sir Marmaduke de Chevasse \\"as stiff a Roundhead as ever upheld my Lord Protector and his Puritanic government\\", who is determined to secure the vast fortunes of his lovely ward, Lady Sue, for himself. Sue presents a girlish figure; she is young, alert and vigorous. The charm of her own youth and freshness even means she looks dainty and graceful in clothes that disfigure her elders. She enjoys the adulation which her appearance guarantees, laughing and chattering with the women and teasing the men. She does of course have plenty of admirers, including young Richard Lambert who worships her with protective reverence. Sir Marmaduke who has plans to woo and win Lady Sue disguised as the exiled French Prince of Orléans, resents this faithful espionage and lays a plot to lure young Lambert to a gaming-house in London. Richard knows that gambling is an illicit pastime and that he is breaking the law, but is compelled to take his seat at the table by his employer. Richard is then duped into taking part in a brawl and is summarily arrested leaving the way open for Marmaduke to carry out his cowardly deception and he soon tricks Sue into marrying him. Sir Marmaduke persuades his widowed sister-in-law to abet him in this plot, in which she unwittingly disgraces one of her long lost sons and finds the other murdered by the villain. Though set in a completely different kind of background, the plot has some resemblance with the Sherlock Holmes story \\"A Case of Identity\\".

The Story of the Dingley Island Causeway Project. The island was until recently connected to adjacent Great Island by a solid, . causeway that had been constructed around 1954. However, the resulting buildup of silt in Dingley Cove, in the area adjacent to the causeway, was by the mid 1990s threatening to turn the area into a salt marsh. Such a transformation would have significantly reduced the important clam harvest in this area and on associated livelihoods. The island's of clam flats generate an average annual harvest of some $225,000.Corporate Wetlands Restoration Partnership - Projects In response to this growing environmental concern, residents and neighbors of Dingley Island began in 1996 to investigate the possibility of replacing a portion of the causeway with a bridge that would allow the restoration of normal tidal flows to the cove. Over the next several years, various partners were brought on board, including the Town of Harpswell, the US Navy Innovative Readiness Training Program (IRT), Bowdoin College students and faculty, the New Meadows River Watershed Project, the Maine Corporate Wetlands Restoration Partnership and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These partners, led by Harpswell Resident Elsa Martz, worked together to develop and finance the bridge construction project, which cost approximately $174,000.

Plot synopsis  Mr. Artur Sammler, Holocaust survivor, intellectual, and occasional lecturer at Columbia University in 1960s New York City, is a \\"registrar of madness\\", a refined and civilized being caught among people crazy with the promises of the future (moon landings, endless possibilities). \\"Sorry for all and sore at heart\\", he observes how greater luxury and leisure have only led to more human suffering. To Mr. Sammler—who by the end of the novel has found the compassionate consciousness necessary to bridge the gap between himself and his fellow beings—a good life is one in which a person does what is \\"required of him\\". To know and to meet the \\"terms of the contract\\" was as true a life as one could live. Literary significance and criticism Though some critics have pigeonholed the novel as a response to the HolocaustDittmar, The end of enlightenment: Bellow's universal view of the Holocaust in \\"Sammler's Planet\\" or as a Jeremiad against 1960s social moresCambridge History of American Literature, p.256 — and it is true that Sammler is horrified by those mores because, as Philip Roth pointed out, he views them as \\"the betrayal by the crazy species of the civilized ideal\\"Roth, Rereading Saul Bellow — others have noted that the novel revolves, as does Herzog, around Sammler's conflicts between intellect and intuition, between acting in the world and standing aside to observe it.Pifer, Saul Bellow against the Grain, p.11 In a slowly building epiphany at the novel's end, Sammler finds a balance; Joyce Carol Oates wrote that she admired \\"the conclusion of Mr. Sammler's Planet, which is so powerful that it forces us to immediately reread the entire novel, because we have been altered in the process of reading it and are now, at its conclusion, ready to begin reading it.\\"Oates, Whose Side Are You On At the conclusion, Sammler speaks to God. Referring either to the existence of objective moral truths or to the existence of God Himself, he says: \\"For that is the truth of it--that we all know, God, that we know, that we know, we know, we know.\\"Bellow, Mr. Sammler's Planet, page 313 In a lecture a few years later, asked to explain those lines, Bellow said this: \\"You read the New Testament and the assumption Jesus makes continually is that people know the difference immediately between good and evil...

He holds the record for the most time spent by an Allied POW in solitary confinement. Early life Tunstall was born in Chadwell St Mary, Essex, in 1918 and moved to the nearby village of Orsett at the age of three. As a schoolboy he took his first flying lesson from a local airfield, paid for by shooting and selling rabbits to his local butcher. He joined the RAF in 1937 and trained at No 61 Squadron at Hemswell in Lincolnshire and eventually became a Hampden pilot. During his RAF training he was told by A.J. Evans – a World War I Royal Flying Corps pilot and double prisoner-of-war escapee – that if he was captured, \\"Your first duty was to try to escape. Your second duty was to be as big a bloody nuisance as possible to the enemy.\\" Tunstall took the advice to heart. Second World War Tunstall flew combat missions over France during and after the British retreat to Dunkirk. He was captured on the night of 26/27 August 1940, when, due to a wireless failure, his aircraft became lost and crash-landed on the Dutch coast. As a prisoner of war, he was initially sent to a POW camp in Poland. After trying to escape from the camp dressed as a German NCO he was transferred to Spangenberg Castle. It was during his incarceration at Spangenberg Castle that Tunstall, along with Eustace Newborn and Dominic Bruce came up with the escape plan known as \\"the Swiss Commission\\". The escape attempt has gone down as one of the most audacious of the war. Using uniforms found in the castle and suits made from uniforms, the three POWs simply walked out of the camp during an inspection by the Swiss Red Cross. They spent ten days at large before being recaptured. Tunstall was then moved to Oflag VIB, where he tried again to escape dressed as a German soldier. Following this attempt, he was shipped to Colditz Castle on 15 March 1942. Here Tunstall perfected his \\"goon-baiting\\" (activities to distract and annoy the German guards). At Colditz, he also developed methods of getting information back to Britain inside photographs and letters. At the end of the war, he was recommended for an award by MI9, but it was turned down by the Colonel Willie Tod, the senior British officer at Colditz. Tunstall disputes some of the stories about Colditz. He did work with Escape Officers to cause diversions when an escape was \\"on\\". He did pull stunts and spoil roll calls at other times, otherwise the Germans would have known an escape was being covered up. However, he disputes that POWs threw \\"excrement\\" bombs or blew \\"raspberries\\" at the Germans. Nor does he know of anyone who did such things. Tunstall was liberated by American troops on 16 April 1945 and returned to Britain shortly afterwards. Post war After the war, Tunstall continued to serve in the RAF until 1958 as a flying instructor on Meteor and Vampire jets. He also served at the Advanced Flying Training School (No. 5 FTS) at Oakington in Cambridgeshire as a chief flying instructor. After leaving the RAF, he joined Laker Airways before emigrating to South Africa, where he worked as an actor as well as continuing to fly. His autobiography, The Last Escaper, was published in 2014. Death Tunstall died on 27 July 2013 at his home in South Africa.

It is dedicated to the study of archaeology, art history, anthropology and epigraphy. Admission is based on a competitive entrance exam after high school (lycée), though candidates may also apply after two or three years of university studies in the subjects of history, classics, literature, geography, philosophy and art. The school offers an undergraduate program, a master's program and a doctoral program as well as a preparation class for civil service entrance exams.  History  The École du Louvre was created in 1882 with the mission to \\"extract from the collections the knowledge they contain, and to train curators, missionaries and excavators\\". The school was originally dedicated to archaeology, but soon expanded to related disciplines, such as history of art, anthropology and ancient languages. The school was created in a context of expansion of higher education in Europe, and in France in particular, which was reflected by providing lectures to the general public in addition to providing an education to students. Public lectures and conferences aimed at fee-paying \\"auditors\\", and summer school, continues the tradition on which the school was based. Other prestigious institutions were created during the same period in France, such as the Institut d'études politiques de Paris (Sciences-Po) or the École des Hautes Études Commerciales (HEC). In 1920, the school established the General Art History course (known as HGA), that became the foundation for the curriculum. This course would develop into the current graduate program over the following years. In 1927, the school was innovative by creating the chair of museology, the first such in the world. In 1998, following the development of the Grand Louvre, the school moved to its present location in the Aile de Flore, the river-facing wing of the museum. The École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts or the Ecole Boulle are also well known art institutions in France. Teaching The entrance hall in the École du Louvre. As of 2006, the École du Louvre complies with the Bologna process and offers an undergraduate degree after three years (Premier Cycle), a master's degree after two years (Deuxième cycle) and a research degree in three years (Troisième Cycle). It also provides preparation classes for some civil service exams as well as conferences for a wider public. Altogether, there are about 700 teaching staff. =Premier cycle= Undergraduate students follow a core course called HGA (General Art History studying various periods and areas). Lectures are held in an amphitheatre, and tutorials are held in various museums providing a \\"hands-on\\" experience with the material. The first year is dedicated to the Antiquity, with an emphasis on Prehistoric, Classical and Oriental Archaeology. The second year focuses on the History of Art and Archaeology of the non-Western world, as well as the study of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The final year focuses on the History of Art in modern times, and African and Oceana Art including Anthropology. In addition to the core course, in their first year students choose a specialisation area to study for the duration of the degree, known as cours organiques or spé. Currently 31 specialisations (or cours organiques) exist such as painting, drawing, sculpture, engraving, furniture, architecture, industrial design, cinema, fashion, photography created in various areas all over the world such as in Europe, Africa, America, Oceania or Middle and Far East. Students also take courses in Epigraphy, Numismatics or Modern Languages. =Deuxième cycle= The Aile de Flore, the Ecole du Louvre's frontage. The master's program is composed of two years. During the first year, students study museology and research methods. At the end of the second year, students submit a master's thesis highlighting research and work experience. =Troisième cycle= Although the research program is not formally a doctoral program, delivering a diplôme de recherche approfondie instead, students spend the three or more years conducting extensive academic research under the direction of a supervisor from the École du Louvre. Academic partnerships The École du Louvre has exchange agreements with the Université de Montréal in Quebec, the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti in Venice, Italy and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. In October 2014, a new dual degree Master's program between the Ecole du Louvre and Sciences Po was announced. Library and publications The École du Louvre possesses one of the largest Art History and Archeology collections, which is made available to academics and students. The École du Louvre regularly publishes books, manuals and academic research, often in conjunction with an external publishing house.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Voždovac. It has a distinction of being \\"the largest village of Serbia\\" taking in account its number of population, but also because it has the largest area of all rural settlements in the country.  Location  Ripanj is located some 25 kilometers south of Belgrade, on the southern slopes of the Avala mountain, in the valley of the Topčiderka river. It is the southernmost settlement in the municipality, on the northern side of the Lipovica woods, near the tripoint of the municipalities of Voždovac, Barajevo and Sopot.  History  It is believed that settlement got its name from the large rock in the vicinity, called Ripa. Slopes of the Avala were already inhabioted in Neolithic. The location is an old mining area as it is known that already Romans were extracting mercury and silver and the tradition was later continued by the medieval Saxon miners. One of the major Serbian industrialists in the early 20th century, Đorđe Vajfert, also owned several mining fields. The mercury extraction from the Avala mountain ended in the second half of the 20th century. The village got its first school in 1824, the same year when the first church was built. The small, wooden church (crkva-brvanara) was later replaced with the large Church of the Holy Trinity in 1892. There was a spring of mineral water in the village. The water was sour (kisela voda). It was located in the Tupovac locality which doesn't exist anymore. The spring was recorded in the 1892 papers published by the state government.  Administration  Ripanj used to be a separate municipality which originally comprised only the village of Ripanj. It had a population of 7,475 in 1948 and 8,255 in 1953. In 1956, Brđani and Bošnjaci were detached from the settlement of Ripanj into separate settlements, but within the municipality. Ripanj was then annexed to the municipality of Voždovac, but if it had continued to exist it would have a population of 10,533 in 1961 and 10,673 in 1971. Brđani, in 1977, and Bošnjaci, in 1979, were abolished as a separate statistical entities, becoming part of the village of Ripanj again, which, since then corresponds to the area and population of the former municipality.  Population  Ripanj is still statistically classified as a rural settlement (village). Population has been stagnating for the last several decades, according to the official censuses of population: * 1863 - 1,839 * 1921 - 5,012 * 1948 - 7,475 * 1953 - 8,255 * 1961 - 7,610 (settlement); 10,533 (ex-municipal) * 1971 - 7,873 (settlement); 10,673 (ex-municipal) * 1981 - 10,463 * 1991 - 10,320 * 2002 - 10,741 * 2011 - 11,088  Characteristics  Ripanj is still largely agricultural settlement. The electrotechnics factory \\"Elektrosrbija\\" is located in Ripanj, so as the three \\"Minel\\" factory departments. Ripanj is located in the northern, low Šumadija and the neighboring plateau is named after the settlement (Ripanj plateau), south of the Pinosava plateau. A railway Belgrade-Niš (both parallel lines) passes next to the settlement and the tunnel south of Ripanj is named the \\"Ripanj tunnel\\". Former mine, Crveni Breg (\\"Red Hill\\"), is located in the northernmost section of Ripanj. Lead, zinc, silver and gold were extracted from the Roman period until 1953 when the mine was closed. It has seven levels, out of which four are flooded, and the stalactites are being formed inside. By 2009 upper level was prepared for the visitors, being cleaned and lighted for some but the project of turning it into the tourist attraction failed. Ripanj is location of the closed Tešićev Majdan (\\"Tešić Quarry\\"). The stone pit was privately owned, but was confiscated by the state after World War II and stopped operating before 1960. In the process of the restitution after 2000, the quarry was returned to the surviving owners, but they live abroad so the quarry is still not operational. It is the only known location of kersantite in Serbia, a worldwide rare type of greenish granite. For decades, kersantite was used for the Belgrade buildings, including some of the most representative ones. Features built with this stone include the fountain between the Novi Dvor and Stari Dvor, bordure of the Hotel Bristol, Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, pedestal of the Play of Black Horses statues in front of the House of the National Assembly of Serbia and buildings of Belgrade Cooperative, Elementary School King Petar I, Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel and Main Post Office Building. As the buildings began to deteriorate in time, city authorities showed interest in the quarry, not only for the repairs but also for the future construction. For now, when some deteriorated kersantine feature has to be replaced, the artificial stone is used (as in the case of the pedestal of the Play of Black Horses). Geologists suggested to the city to obtain the ownership over the land on which the pit is located and to reopen it. City government announced in 2012 that it will unilaterally explore the pit until it gets reopened and inspected it in 2013. They found still existing large amounts of already cut kersantite and that locals illegally extract the stone and crush it to cover the roads with it. After the political change in Belgrade in the late 2013, the motion was dropped. In the hamlet od Drobnjaci, there is a dedicated to the Bogorodica Trojeručica. Construction began in 2012 and the foundations were consecrated on 1 April 2015. Monastery is built from wood and since 2016 it hosts a copy of the Bogorodica Trojeručica icon, sent from the Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos. Within the complex, the log church was built from 2013 to 2017. Walls are made of silicate bricks, coated with white pine wood. The church covers and contains two thrones made of cooked walnut wood. Both host icons, of the Bogorodica Trojeručica, and of . One of only three officially designated campsites in Belgrade by 2018 is located in Ripanj. A small camping ground, it is situated on the slopes in the Avala mountain.  Boroughs  As a large and elongated settlement, stretched along the road and railway (there are five railway stations within the Ripanj area), it developed outer boroughs or comprised the formerly separate settlements. Some of the largest are: * Bela Reka, north-west of downtown Ripanj; itself, sub-part of Kolonija and location of the Bela Reka artificial lake, created on the creek of the same name in 1988; the lake also receives water from two wells which are now submerged. The lake is located south of downtown Belgrade. Average depth is and the summer water temperature is about , but after 2006, when a boy drowned in the lake, the swimming is forbidden. Surrounding area is adapted as an excursion site with the former mine shaft in the vicinity used for the parties. The lake is a popular fishing spot as it is inhabited with common carp, wels catfish, grass carp, zander, European chub and Prussian carp. The catch is limited to per fisherman daily. * Bela Zemlja, east; * Bošnjaci, south-west; in 1956-79 detached from Ripanj as a separate settlement with the population of 881 in 1961 and 742 in 1971; from detachment to 1959 officially named Bošnjaci- Stublovi; * Brđani, south-east; in 1956-77 detached from Ripanj as a separate settlement with the population of 2,042 in 1961 and 2,058 in 1971. * Čaršija, on the foothills of the Avala, it is a location of an archeological site The most important artefact from this Neolithic find is the \\"Ripanj statuette\\", a female deity, dated to 4th or 3rd millennium B.C., represented as sitting on a throne. Figurine is made of terra cotta, 16 centimeters high and missing head, arms and feet. * Drobnjaci; * Kablar, informal settlement, mostly inhabited by the Romani people. In June 2008 old shacks were replaced with the new mobile homes and water and sewage systems were introduced; * Kolonija; The Minel factory is stationed here. The football club FC Minel is also located here. * Prnjavor, east of Bela Zemlja; it had an estimated population of over 1,000 in 2017; * Stepašinovac; * Stražarija; = Trešnja = Lake Trešnja Trešnja is the easternmost settlement of Ripanj, a popular picnic area located north of the Ralja river, on the northern slopes of the high Koviona hill, along the Belgrade-Kragujevac road. It is south-east of Belgrade and closer to Vrčin in the municipality of Grocka than to Ripanj and the village of Mala Ivanča is just south of it. Parts of the settlement, forest and the lake belong to Mala Ivanča in the municipality of Sopot. It is located in the afforested valley, rich in big game (mouflon, roe deer, fallow deer), which was turned into an official fenced hunting ground which spreads between the altitudes of . The surrounding area, which covers an area of , comprises a small artificial pond, two cold water springs, a restaurant, weekend-settlement and a car camping park. The pond is long, wide and up to deep and populated with the Prussian carp, common carp and asp. One side of the lake is surrounded with the oak wood and the other with the conifers. Popular among the visitors in the 1970s and 1980s, Trešnja is largely neglected today. A motel on the shore was burned in a fire in the late 2000s and left in ruins. The shore is unkempt so as the access paths to the lake while the quality of water hasn't been tested for years, though a crayfish, known to live only in the non-polluted waters, lives in the lake. The lake is still visited by the fishermen and has a reputation of a lover's lane. One of the classical works of Serbian filmmaking, The Marathon Family by Slobodan Šijan, was partially filmed on the lake in 1981. Public transportation line, bus No 408, connects Trešnja with Belgrade. In order to make water less polluted, Belgrade administration and Forestry Institute jointly organized a project of naturally cleaning the lake water using floating islands. First group of floating islands was placed on the lake surface in May 2019. They are to be removed in September 2019 and will be replaced with a new group of plant islands in 2020. In the meantime, the testing of the water will show how successful the project is. If the results are positive, and with the additional beneficial influence of such islands on the restoration of biodiversity and visual enhancement of the landscape, the project will be used for other bodies of water on the city's administrative territory.

The limestone feature, which was in Dwejra Bay close to the Inland Sea and Fungus Rock, was one of the island's major tourist attractions until it collapsed in stormy weather on 8 March 2017. The small rock over the water is no longer accessible by walking. The arch, together with other natural features in the area, has appeared in a number of international films and media productions. The rock formation, which consisted of a pillar rising from the sea joined to the cliff by a horizontal slab, was created by the collapse of a sea cave, probably during the 19th century. The final collapse followed a century of natural erosion, during which large sections of the limestone arch had broken off and fallen into the sea. History Richard Ellis, around 1890 =Formation= The entrance to the Inland Sea, which is referred to as the Tieka Szerka (Azure Window) in 17th- and 18th-century sources. The natural arch may have inherited its name from this cave The Azure Window developed through sea erosion of a cliff face. The progress starts with an initial notch resulting from wave action. This space devoid of rock then causes tensile stresses that lead to the formation of a vertical joint extending upwards from the notch. This joint would progressively become wider, first forming a cave and eventually an arch. The end of the lifecycle of the arch is reached when erosion finally progressed so far that the roof of the arch gets heavier than the pillars can support. It is not known exactly when the arch came to being, but the entire process is believed to have taken around 500 years. The arch is not mentioned in 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of the Dwejra area, which was already famous due to the nearby Fungus Rock, so it probably did not exist then. Giovanni Francesco Abela's 1647 book Della Descrizione di Malta and De Soldanis' 1746 manuscript Il Gozo Antico-Moderno e Sacro-Profano both mention a Tieqa Żerqa (written archaically as Tieka Szerka) or Għar iż-Żerqa, but this referred to the cave entrance to the nearby Inland Sea. Therefore, it is likely that when the Azure Window formed it inherited its name from this other cave. The earliest known record of the Azure Window is in an 1824 illustration of the nearby Dwejra Tower. However, it is shown in the background of the image, and it is unclear whether it was still a cave or if it had already developed into an arch. A pencil drawing by Lt Col. Richard Irton of a fully formed Azure Window probably dates to 1830. In 1866, artist Edward Lear visited Dwejra and stated in his journal that \\"the coast scenery is not nearly as fine as that of Malta.\\" The earliest recorded photographs of the natural arch were probably taken by Richard Ellis, and they are found in an album belonging to Michael Dundon dated 26 July 1879. The photo by Ellis was published in a book in 2011, showing contrasting difference with 20th and 21st century photos. Throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries, the arch was one of Malta's main tourist landmarks, and it was a popular backdrop in photographs. It was included in a Special Area of Conservation, and in 1998, included on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, along with the rest of Dwejra Bay. =Deterioration and partial collapses= Between the 1980s and the 2000s, parts of the top slab of the arch collapsed, significantly widening the arch. A large slab of rock on the outer edge of the cavity collapsed in April 2012, further increasing the size of the window. Another rock fall occurred in March 2013. Four months later a geological and geotechnical report was prepared by consultant Peter Gatt, who represented local firm Geoscience Consulting Ltd, and it determined that the arch was \\"relatively stable and will continue to remain so for a number of years\\", and that there was no \\"imminent\\" risk of collapse, although it warned that rock falls will continue and it might be hazardous for people to go close to the arch. Further rock falls and fissures were reported in subsequent years. Fishermen avoided going near the arch with their boats, and warning signs were put up to discourage people from walking on top. However, many people still went on the arch regularly, and videos were uploaded on YouTube of people cliff diving from the window as rocks were falling down. In March 2016, Gatt warned that the illegal use of explosives at the nearby Inland Sea could have an effect on the already weak structure of the nearby Azure Window. These comments were made in the wake of an investigation by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority which revealed that explosive material was \\"probably used\\" to do rock cutting in the tunnel leading to the Inland Sea. It was suspected that the illegal cutting was aimed at widening the entrance to allow larger boats to sail through. In December 2016, an emergency order was published prohibiting people from going on the arch, trespassers facing a fine of €1500. However, this law was not enforced, and visitors were still walking on top of the arch days before it collapsed in March 2017. =Final collapse= The arch collapsed at about 9:40 am local time (8:40 am UTC) on 8 March 2017 after a period of heavy storms, leaving nothing visible above the water. The pillar gave way first, causing the top part of the arch to collapse along with it. The pillar shattered into large chunks of rock as it collapsed. The collapse was said to have been inevitable. Azure Window before and after collapse in 2017 The collapse was reported in both local and international media. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil both tweeted about the collapse of the Azure Window, and it also became the subject of many Internet memes on Maltese social media. The Environment and Resources Authority called the collapse a major loss to Malta's natural heritage. The Church's Environment Commission said that the collapse should make the Maltese people reflect on their national heritage. The San Lawrenz local council urged the government to establish a management plan for the entire Dwejra area, which includes several other notable features despite the loss of the Azure Window. On the day of the collapse, police appealed to the public not to visit the area. Diving in the area was temporarily banned, although this was not enforced and footage of the remains of the arch underwater emerged a few days after the collapse. The remains of the arch have formed a number of features which have been called a \\"divers' paradise\\", although Transport Malta and the Environment and Resources Authority still advised the public to keep away from the area until surveys and inspections are carried out. Following the collapse, Gatt said that following his report, he had requested the arch and pillar to be monitored over a long period of time, in a bid to study the area and establish whether the pillar supporting the arch was moving, \\"but there wasn't any follow-up and the condition of the pillar remained unknown.\\" =Aftermath= On 9 March 2017, the government announced that it would launch an international initiative on the future of Dwejra. The options being considered include leaving the site as is, retrieving the remains of the window from the seabed and exhibiting them, creating an artificial or an augmented reality reconstruction of the window, establishing an interpretation centre or creating an art installation at the site. The government stated that the rock formation will not be rebuilt. The only response to this international call was by Gozitan developer Joseph Portelli, proposing to construct a hotel within a quarry close to the site of the Azure Window. The project would also include an interpretation area, a diving centre, an interactive museum, a sky observation centre and transport facilities. In August 2018 it was announced that the government does not plan to proceed with this proposal. In late 2018, the Russian architect Svetozar Andreev of Hoteì Russia, in collaboration with Elena Britanishskaya, announced a proposal to construct a steel structure on the site of the Azure Window. Entitled The Heart of Malta, the project consists of a structure with polygonal mirrored steel faces, having its size and proportions based on that of the former natural arch. The structure is to include five floors containing over of exhibition space, with each floor representing a period of Maltese history. A central spiral will connect the floors together. This proposal drew mixed reactions from the public. Most respondents to online polls were in favour. However, the project has also been criticized since the area is a marine park and the intervention would destroy the underwater remains of the original Azure Window. Moreover, the foundations would have to rest in the sea at a depth of over , and the site is prone to heavy storms. In August 2019, a new street in the nearby village of San Lawrenz was named Triq it-Tieqa tad-Dwejra (Dwejra Window Street) in memory of the natural landmark. Geology The Azure Window was a natural arch with a height of about and a span of around . It was at the tip of a headland known as Dwejra Point. The arch was within the Lower Coralline Limestone Formation, a succession of sedimentary rocks that is widespread on the Maltese Islands and was deposited during the Oligocene. The Formation is subdivided into two Members, Member A and Member B. Member A formed the arch's base and pillars, and Member B formed much of the unsupported top of the arch. Member A, ca. 20 m in thickness, mainly consists of the fossils of coralline red algae within a calcite cement. At the arch, it included four facies, numbered A-1 to A-4, with A-2 being the thickest. Deposition of these sediments was slow and occurred in water depths > with moderate currents. Member B was ca. in thickness and included five facies, numbered B-1 to B-5. B-1 forms a thin layer of white limestone between Member A and the rest of Member B which is rather soft and therefore more easily eroded, it therefore formed a depression around the window. It was deposited in shallow water with high wave action. B-2 and B-3 formed a -thick bed of horizontal and cross-bedded packstone to grainstone, which are porous and therefore less compact. B-5 was a -thick layer of packstone to wackestone limestone, and formed the upper unsupported part of the arch. The facies of Member B contained a number of fossils, including Scutella, Pecten, large echinoid spines and large benthic foraminifera. All of the beds of Member B were penetrated by two joints. A hybrid layer overlaid by Globigerina Limestone was found on top of facies B-5, but this was heavily eroded. The arch was near the Inland Sea, a large circular sinkhole reached by a small arch that developed along a joint in the rocks. Fungus Rock, an islet that was formed when the bridge of a natural arch collapsed leaving a stack, is also nearby. The area also contains the Dwejra Tower, a 17th-century coastal watchtower built by the Order of St. John. Another natural arch, the Wied il-Mielaħ Window, is about northeast of Dwejra. It is, however, less known than the Azure Window. Media appearances The Azure Window features in a number of films, including Clash of the Titans (1981), The Count of Monte Cristo (2002) and the 2010 Tamil language Indian film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya. It can also be seen in the television miniseries The Odyssey (1997). It was used as a filming location for the Dothraki wedding scene in the first season of HBO's TV series Game of Thrones. The filming of Game of Thrones resulted in controversy when a protected ecosystem was damaged by a subcontractor. Cliff diver David Colturi is featured in a 2017 Hugo Boss advert video at the Azure Window and the Wied il-Mielaħ Window.

It is one of the Chilean volcanoes of the Andes, and more specifically the Chilean segment of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the four volcanic belts which make up the Andean Volcanic Belt. The Central Volcanic Zone spans Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and includes 44 active volcanoes as well as the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, a system of large calderas and ignimbrites of which Purico is a member of. Licancabur to the north, La Pacana southeast and Guayaques to the east are separate volcanic systems. The Purico complex consists of a shield shaped volcanic structure consisting of the Purico ignimbrite and a number of secondary volcanoes that are emplaced on this volcanic shield. During the ice ages, the shield was in part covered by glaciers which have left moraines. Purico is the source of the Purico ignimbrite, a moderately large ignimbrite with a volume of about . After the emplacement of the Purico ignimbrite, a number of lava domes and stratovolcanoes developed on the ignimbrite shield. The maar of Alitar is still fumarolically active. In historical times, sulfur was mined on Purico, and presently the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory lies on the ignimbrite shield.  Geography and structure  The Purico complex lies in Chile close to the border between Bolivia and Chile, east of the town of San Pedro de Atacama and northeast of Toconao. The volcanic complex can be seen from San Pedro de Atacama. A road runs along the northern and eastern margin of the Purico complex, and a gas pipeline crosses the complex as well. The existence of the Purico complex was established on the basis of Landsat images. = Regional = Licancabur volcano was constructed on ignimbrites from Purico just north of the complex. Guayaques lies east of Purico, the La Pacana caldera is located southeast of the complex, and La Pacana's Filo Delgado ignimbrite has buried part of the Purico ignimbrite. The known volcanoes Lascár and El Tatio are found at larger distances from Purico. Purico is part of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), a belt of volcanoes that runs along the western margin of South America between 14° and 28° southern latitude. This belt is one of four separate volcanic belts that make up the Andean Volcanic Belt and which are separated from each other by gaps where no recent volcanism occurs. The CVZ segment includes 44 active systems, 18 minor volcanic centres and over 6 large ignimbrite or caldera systems. One of these volcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the highest volcano in the world. The largest historical eruption in the CVZ occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina in Peru. = Local = A view across the Purico complex The Purico shield seen from Cerro Toco Purico is a circular shield with a diameter of , whose slopes descend away from a centre at an elevation of . This shield forms a plateau, which is known as the Chajnantor Plateau, and which contains further flat areas such as Llano de Chajnantor, Pampa El Vallecito and Pampa La Bola. There is no evidence that a caldera exists there, unlike in many other volcanoes of this type. To the west, close to the margin of the Salar de Atacama, the shield drops down to a bajada. A north-south trending system of fractures and conspicuous normal faults cuts across the western margin of the Purico complex. On top of this shield, a complex of lava domes and lavas reaches elevations of over above sea level; the vent of the ignimbrite may be buried beneath this complex. This complex forms approximately a wide semicircle open to the southwest around the centre of the shield, which may reflect the existence of a ring fault on which the individual centres were emplaced. Clockwise starting from the west this semicircle includes high Cerro Negro (), Cerro Purico, \\"dacite dome D\\" and high El Cerillo which is also known as Cerro Chajnantor (), high Cerro El Chascon (), the high Cerro Aspero ( and the high Cerro Putas () to the south. All these domes (with the exception of the pancake-like \\"dacite dome D\\") have conical shapes, and Aspero, El Cerillo and El Chascon appear to be post- glacial in age. The Chascon dome is constructed by lava flows and has a well preserved summit crater, while Cerro Purico is a stratovolcano and also known as Cerro Toco (). Additional more subdued structures in the principal complex are high Cerro Agua Amarga () just southwest of El Chascon and the Cordon Honor with Cerro Purico Sur in the \\"opening\\" of the semicircle. Lahars and debris flows from the volcanoes have covered parts of the ignimbrite shield with gravels. A meltwater-fed spring on Cerro Toco is known as Aguada Pajaritos, and a small lake Laguna de Agua Amarga is found south of Chascon. Presently, the Purico complex forms the drainage divide between the Salar de Atacama and the Salar de Pujsa. The high Macon stratovolcano () and the Alitar maar () lie to the south of the main complex. 1000x1000px  Geology  West of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at rates of . This subduction process along with that of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South American Plate farther south is responsible for volcanism in the Andean Volcanic Belt. Volcanic activity in the region of the Central Volcanic Zone has been ongoing for 200 million years, but with temporal and local variations; 25 million years ago for example it was centered farther east and later moved west. About 23 million years ago, large scale ignimbritic activity commenced in the region with the emplacement of the Oxaya Formation, followed by the Altos de Pica Formation 17-15 million years ago. However, effusive activity of andesitic composition dominated volcanism until the late Miocene. = Regional = Purico appears to be part of a group of large, caldera-forming volcanic centres that erupted dacitic ignimbrites, a group that is known as the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. This group includes the Cerro Guacha, Cerro Panizos, Coranzulí, La Pacana, Pastos Grandes and Vilama centres that cluster around the tripoint between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. The arid climate of this region means that most volcanic systems are well preserved with little erosion. This complex is underpinned by a magma body at depths of , where arc magmas interact with the crust to form the secondary magmas later erupted by the volcanoes of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. This magma body has been imaged with seismic tomography as a sill-like body and has been named the \\"Altiplano-Puna magma body\\". Ignimbritic activity in such systems is episodic, being interrupted by periods with lower volume \\"steady state\\" volcanism. The eruption of the Purico ignimbrite is the youngest large ignimbrite eruption in the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex; the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex presently is in such a \\"steady state\\" stage, but the presence of active geothermal system indicates that magmatic activity is still ongoing. = Local = Outcrops in the region range in age from Paleozoic to Holocene. The Purico complex formed on top of older ignimbrites such as the Atana ignimbrite in the south and the Puripicar ignimbrite farther north; the neighbouring La Pacana caldera between 4.5 and 4.1 million years ago erupted some of these ignimbrites including the Atana ignimbrite. Occasionally Purico is considered part of the La Pacana system. = Composition = The Purico complex has erupted various different magmas, ranging from the dacitic Purico ignimbrite over rhyolitic pumices contained in the ignimbrite to the andesitic-dacitic post-ignimbrite volcanics. Dacite is the dominant component and forms a crystal-rich potassium-rich suite. Varying amounts of phenocrysts occur in the Purico complex rocks; the minerals they are formed of include augite, biotite, clinopyroxene, hornblende, hypersthene, iron oxides, oligoclase, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, quartz and titanium oxides. Additionally, mafic xenoliths are found in the Purico ignimbrite; such xenoliths are a common finding in volcanic arc rocks. They are even more common in Chascon rocks, where they might reflect the occurrence of mafic magma in the feeder system prior to the formation of Chascon. Some physical properties of the Purico magmas have been inferred from the chemistry and petrology of the erupted rocks. The dacites had temperatures of about while the andesites and rhyolites reached higher temperatures, up to . Water contents ranged from 3.2 to 4.8% by weight, while carbon dioxide concentrations were low throughout.  Climate and vegetation  The climate at Purico is cold (mean temperatures ), the air thin because of the high elevation and ultraviolet radiation is high. There is little precipitation in the area (about on the upper parts of the shield, decreasing to less than close to the Salar de Atacama), which mainly happens during the summer months as a consequence of the South American monsoon. This dry climate is due to the combined effects of the subtropical ridge, the Humboldt Current in the Pacific Ocean and the rain shadow exercised by the Andes, but it was in the past interrupted by wet periods. The dry climate and high elevation mean that vegetation is scarce in the region, with cacti such as Echinopsis atacamensis and grasses occurring at lower elevations. The little vegetation that is present displays an altitudinal zonation with a lower \\"Prepuna\\" with shrubs and succulents, a middle \\"Puna\\" with grasses and shrubs and a \\"high Andean steppe\\" with bunch grass. A report in 1993 stated that red-brown cacti and brown grass grew around the foot of Purico. Conversely, the soils on the Purico complex contain a diverse population of microbes which have to tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Among these are the bacteria Amycolatopsis vastitatis, Lentzea chajnantorensis and Streptomyces aridus which were first isolated at the Purico complex. Penitentes on Purico Increased moisture availability during the ice ages caused the development of glaciers on Purico; at times, an ice cap with outlet glaciers covered an area of about at elevation on Purico. Apparently three different stages of glaciation occurred, the third between 30,000–25,000 years ago, the second between 50,000–60,000 years ago and the first over 100,000 years ago. These glaciations have left moraines on Purico which extend for many kilometres at altitudes of , sometimes descending as far down as . The moraines reach heights of on the eastern side of Purico and on its western side. These moraines are covered with boulders and accompanied by striated surfaces and erratics. Penitentes still occur on Purico to this day.  Eruptive history  The Purico complex is the source of the major Purico ignimbrite. It was originally called Cajon ignimbrite and attributed to an area northwest of Purico known as Chaxas. Also, the Toconao ignimbrite was originally attributed to the Purico complex, but now the La Pacana caldera is considered to be its source. The Purico ignimbrite itself covers a surface area of over the whole complex, and its volume has been estimated to be with an additional contributed by tephra fall deposits. The ignimbrite is thick and becomes thinner westward, with more distal sectors reaching thicknesses of . Potassium-argon dating has yielded ages between 1,380,000 ± 70,000 and 870,000 ± 520,000 years ago for the Purico ignimbrite. The large \\"dacitic dome D\\" has an age of 980,000 ± 50,000 and may thus have formed at the same time as the ignimbrites. The emplacement of the Purico ignimbrite was part of a pulse of activity in the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex 1 million years ago. The Purico ignimbrite contains three flow units, the two Lower Purico Ignimbrites and the Upper Purico Ignimbrite. Their thicknesses differ; the Upper ignimbrite is thick while the two lower ones together reach an average thickness of , with a maximum of . The lowermost Lower Purico Ignimbrite is one single flow. The upper Lower Purico Ignimbrite is more heterogeneous, starting with a base surge, a pumice layer and then another flow unit, which is volumetrically the largest part. The Lower Purico Ignimbrite covers a surface of primarily on the western side of the Purico complex. Finally, the Upper Purico Ignimbrite is a moderately to densely welded flow that occurs particularly close to the summit of the Purico complex, where it forms six flow units that contain fiamme textures. Characteristic for the Purico ignimbrite is the so-called \\"banded\\" pumice, which consist of alternating darker mafic and brighter components, in the upper 33% of the ignimbrite. The extrusion of the Purico ignimbrite was accompanied by the eruption of large amounts of tephra, some of which fell as far as the Coastal Cordillera west of Purico. After emplacement, the ignimbrites were modified by fluvial erosion, which formed curvilinear channels in the ignimbrites. In contrast to other ignimbrites in the region, there is little evidence of eolian erosion of the Purico ignimbrite. Eolian erosion takes much longer than fluvial erosion and it is possible that the Purico ignimbrite is too young to have been modified by wind action. Some surfaces of the ignimbrite have been affected by glaciation, giving them a smooth surface. This structure of the ignimbrite has been explained by magma chamber processes. Prior to the Purico ignimbrite eruption, a dacitic magma chamber already existed beneath the volcano. Probably after an injection of andesitic magma, dacitic contents of the magma chamber escaped upwards and formed the lowermost Lower Purico Ignimbrite. This injection of mafic magma rapidly increased the temperature and gas content of the dacite, causing the eruption to become a violent Plinian eruption with the development of an eruption column. This phase then drew onto denser dacitic magma, causing the column to collapse and the Upper Purico Ignimbrite and the \\"dacite dome D\\" to form. = Post-ignimbrite activity = Cerro Toco Volcanic activity after the eruption of the ignimbrite has been subdivided into the older andesitic Purico group and the younger Chascon group. The first includes Cerro Negro, Cerro Purico, Putas and Cerro Toco which assume the structure of polygenetic volcanoes, while the latter is taken to include Aspero, El Cerillo/Chajnantor and El Chascon which are lava dome-lava flow structures. The Chascon group of domes is also the only one which contains mafic xenoliths. The Cerro Purico and Macon volcanoes formed a short time after, and possibly even before, the ignimbrites. They are thus old volcanic centres and deeply eroded, displaying moraine deposits from glaciation and rocks which have been subject to hydrothermal alteration from fumarolic activity. Such hydrothermal alteration processes are also the origin of the sulfur deposits at Purico. Aspero, Cerro El Chascon, Cerros El Negro and Putas are younger and show no evidence of glaciation. El Chascon especially may be only tens of thousands of years old, seeing as it displays both a summit crater and pristine lava flow structures. Aspero was once considered to be of Holocene age; later, dates of 180,000 ± 20,000 years ago were obtained on Aspero and Chascon. Apart from these, there are no radiometric dates for post-ignimbrite volcanic structures at Purico. The eruptive episode that formed these centres is thus more recent than the Purico ignimbrite and may have been triggered by mafic magma being injected into the Purico system. It is also much smaller, with volumes ranging . This change in the pattern of eruptive activity from large ignimbrites to smaller domes reflects a change in the nature of the magma supply, from large volume flow that heavily interacted with the crust and gave rise to the ignimbrites to smaller volume flows in a colder and thus brittler crust and did not accumulate or interact with it in a significant way. Thus the later eruption products appear to be more primitive and less affected by crustal contamination. The Macon stratovolcano is considered to be of Holocene age, and Alitar maar displays active fumaroles. Presently, there is no indication of seismic activity in the Purico area.  Other  A CGI of the ALMA telescope site Purico has been quarried for building materials, and many buildings in San Pedro de Atacama were built from rocks quarried there. As recently as 1993, sulfur was mined on Purico and transported by truck to San Pedro de Atacama where it was processed. In that year, production of sulfur amounted to . The Purico complex is the site of a number of astronomical observatories, including but not limited to the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. In 1998, the Cerro Chascón Science Preserve was established on Purico, which among other things disallows mining in the area of the preserve. This Science Preserve covers most of the Purico complex.

These were the ‘condition of England’ questions\\".John Prest, ‘Peel, Sir Robert, second baronet (1788–1850)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009, accessed 30 Dec 2013. Background The phrase \\"Condition of England Question\\" was first used by Carlyle in Chartism (1839), which significantly contributed to the emergence of a series of debates about the spiritual and material foundations of England and it had a great effect on a number of writers of fiction in the Victorian era and after. Carlyle was concerned with the \\"two nations theme\\", the rich and the poor. Likewise, a number of Victorian condition-of England novelists, particularly Benjamin Disraeli, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens, and Charles Kingsley, attempted with varying effect, to persuade the reading public to look for ways of reducing the gap between the \\"two nations\\". Carlyle contributed to the awakening of social conscience among the reading public and understood the social and political importance of literature. He attacked the growing materialism of Victorian society and its laissez-faire doctrine. In his attacks on the wealthy, Carlyle anticipated some of the ideas of the condition-of England novels. He also inspired social reformers, such as John Ruskin and William Morris. \\"Signs of the Times\\" and the Condition of England question In June 1829, the Edinburgh Review published Carlyle's \\"Signs of the Times\\", in which he anticipates the Condition of England Question he raised a decade later in Chartism (1839) and Past and Present (1843). G. B. Tennyson notes: \\"Carlyle more than any man before him perceived the changes being wrought by the Industrial Revolution.\\" He criticised the ethos of the Industrial Revolution, which, he believed, was destroying human individuality. He expressed his distrust of the spirit of the \\"mechanical age\\", which was manifested not only in the technical progress of English society but also in an overwhelming feeling of lack of mental or spiritual vigour and enthusiasm: \\"The King has virtually abdicated; the Church is a widow, without jointure; public principle is gone; private honesty is going; society, in short, is in fact falling to pieces; and a time of unmixed evil is come on us.\\" The essay was aimed to draw the attention of the reading public to the spiritual price of social change, caused particularly by the frenetic industrialisation. In \\"Signs of the Times\\", Carlyle warned that the Industrial Revolution was turning people into mechanical automatons devoid of individuality and spirituality. For Carlyle, machine and mechanisation had double meaning: they meant literally new technical devices, but also metaphorically mechanistic thought that suppresses human freedom. Carlyle strongly criticised the mechanisation of the human spirit and indicated the high moral costs of industrial change. In this sermon-like essay, Carlyle led a crusade against scientific materialism, Utilitarianism and the laissez-faire system. He believed that the freedom of the emerging mechanical society in England was a delusion because it made workers into greater slaves than their ancient counterparts had been and because mechanization of society threatened the human ability to think and act creatively. In \\"Signs of the Times\\", Carlyle tried to reshape public opinion about the present Condition of England, which he found unbearable. His criticism of the \\"mechanical society\\" produced a memorable narrative in Charles Dickens's novel Hard Times, whose subtitle For These Times is indebted to Carlyle's essay. Chartism Carlyle raised the condition of England question in Chartism, in which he expressed his sympathy for the poor and the industrial class in England and argued the need for a more profound reform. He noticed a discrepancy between a new form of economic activity called “industrialism”, which promised general welfare, and a dramatic degradation in the living conditions of the urban poor. Carlyle, who had studied extensively the causes of the French Revolution, was apprehensive about England’s future. He presented Chartism as a symptom of a disease that affected England. The effect of it could be a revolution if government did not improve the living conditions of the labouring classes. A cure for this disease is, according to Carlyle, a \\"real aristocracy\\" which can lead the working class through the vicissitudes of modern history. Carlyle looked for a new type of “unclassed” aristocracy because he was critical about both an idle landowning aristocracy and a working aristocracy submerged in Mammonism, who instead of being \\"captains of industry\\", are \\"a gang of industrial buccaneers and pirates.\\" Past and Present Past and Present (1843) was written as a response to the economic crisis which began in the early 1840s. This book, like its predecessor Chartism and The Latter-Day Pamphlets (1850), presents a further analysis of the condition of England question. Carlyle contrasted the medieval past and the turbulent Victorian present of the 1830s and 1840s. For him, the latter was a time of uncontrolled industrialisation, worship of money, exploitation of the weak, low wages, poverty, unemployment and riots, which would bring England to self-destruction. Carlyle expresses his critical opinion about the present Condition of England in an elevated, prophetic language. Despite England’s abundant resources, the poor classes are living in deprivation. He shows a depressing picture of the daily life of the workers, many of whom are unable to find meaningful work. Carlyle’s solution was the same as that proposed in Sartor Resartus (1832)—a spiritual rebirth of both the individual and society. The two sections of the book show the contrasting visions of the past and the present. His idealised vision of the past is based on the chronicle of the English monk Jocelyn de Brakelond (died 1211), who described the life of the abbot Samson of Tottington and his monks of Bury St. Edmund’s monastery. Carlyle shows the organisation of life and work of the medieval monks as an authentic idyll, whereas he finds contemporary life increasingly unbearable due to the lack of true leadership. Carlyle argues that a new \\"Aristocracy of Talent\\" should take the lead in the country, and the English people must themselves choose true heroes and not sham-heroes or quacks. In the third chapter of the fourth book of Past and Present, Carlyle makes three practical suggestions for the improvement of social conditions in England. He calls for the introduction of legal hygienic measures, improvement of education and promotion of emigration. Although the first two proposals were soon adopted, the third proposal affected mainly the Irish and Scottish people, and, in a smaller degree, the English population.

The area has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, and the site now occupied by the Cittadella is believed to have been the acropolis of the Punic-Roman city of Gaulos or Glauconis Civitas. During the medieval period, the acropolis was converted into a castle which served as a refuge for Gozo's population. A suburb began to develop outside its walls by the 15th century, and this area now forms the historic core of Victoria. The castle's defences were obsolete by the 16th century, and in 1551 an Ottoman force invaded Gozo and sacked the Cittadella. A major reconstruction of the southern walls of the Cittadella was undertaken between 1599 and 1622, transforming it into a gunpowder fortress. The northern walls were left intact, and today they still retain a largely medieval form. The new fortifications were criticized in later decades, and plans to demolish the entire citadel were made multiple times in the 17th and 18th centuries, but were never carried out. The Cittadella briefly saw action during the French invasion and subsequent uprising in 1798; in both cases the fortress surrendered without much of a fight. It remained a military installation until it was decommissioned by the British on 1 April 1868. The Cittadella contains churches and other historic buildings, including the Cathedral of the Assumption, which was built between 1697 and 1711 on the site of an earlier church. The citadel has been included on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998. History =Prehistory and antiquity= Although there is only limited evidence of Neolithic remains in the Cittadella or Victoria, it is likely that the area has been inhabited since the Stone Age, given its size and strategic position. Ceramics discovered inside the Cittadella suggest that the area was a settlement in prehistory. Archaeological remains such as pottery show that the site of the Cittadella was definitely inhabited during the Bronze Age, in the Tarxien Cemetery and Borġ in-Nadur phases of Maltese prehistory. Bronze Age silos were discovered outside the Cittadella in the 19th century, suggesting that during this period the settlement was larger than the present-day citadel. Roman period remains at the Gozitan Museum of Archeology. The statue in the middle was found attached to the walls of the Cittadella. 2nd-century Latin inscription on a stone block which was reused within the Main Gate The Victoria area remained the main settlement on Gozo throughout the Phoenician and Roman periods, and it became a settlement known as Gaulos or Glauconis Civitas. The city consisted of an acropolis on the site of the Cittadella, and a fortified town in an area now occupied by part of Victoria. A temple dedicated to Juno is said to have stood on the site now occupied by the cathedral. A few inscriptions and architectural fragments from Gaulos have survived, including a 2nd-century AD Latin inscription on a limestone block that was reused in the main gate of the Cittadella. Remains of walls which might have formed part of the Punic-Roman fortifications of Gaulos have been discovered. In 1969, traces of massive walls were discovered during building works in Main Gate Street (), to the south of the Cittadella. Further remains were discovered close to the Cittadella during an archaeological excavation in 2017. =Medieval period= The medieval northern walls of the Cittadella During the medieval period, the Roman town was abandoned, and the acropolis was transformed into a castle. The first reference to the castrum of Gozo dates back to 1241. It was sacked by the Genoese in 1274, and a report on its fortifications was ordered two years later. At this point, one-third of Gozo's population lived in or around the Cittadella, and the island's inhabitants were required to spend the night within the citadel. By the end of the 13th century, the Cittadella housed noblemen from Sicily and mainland Italy who represented the Count of Malta. The Cittadella was called terra by the mid-14th century, and an administrative council known as the Università was founded in 1350. In a testament of 1299 it was called castri Gaudisii. Over time, the Cittadella became too small for the growing population, and by the 15th century the suburb of Rabat began to develop on the site of the Roman town. This settlement was surrounded by a wall with three gates known as Putirjal, Bieb il-Għajn and Bieb il-Għarb. At this point Malta and Gozo were ruled by the Crown of Aragon, and the Cittadella's fortifications were strengthened. The oldest surviving parts of the walls date back from this period. =Hospitaller rule= Mdina. Emperor Charles V handed over Malta and Gozo to the Order of St. John in 1530. The Order was in a state of perpetual war against the Ottoman Empire, which had expelled it from its previous base at Rhodes in 1522. At the time the Cittadella was still a medieval castle, and it provided refuge for the Gozitans during Ottoman or Barbary attacks. The largest attack on the Cittadella took place in July 1551, when a large Ottoman force, led by admiral Sinan Pasha, invaded Gozo and besieged the Cittadella. Governor Gelatian de Sessa offered terms of surrender, but they were refused, and the castle fell within a matter of days. The castle was then sacked, and most of the 6,000 Gozitans, who took refuge there, were taken as slaves. The attack left the castle in ruins, but it was rebuilt soon afterwards, although, initially, no efforts were made to modernize it. The Cittadella was undamaged during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. Although there had been proposals to demolish the castle and evacuate its inhabitants to Sicily, the castle served an important role during the siege, as it maintained a communication link between besieged Birgu and Christian vessels, and it also reported Ottoman movements to the Order. After the siege, Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette and military engineer Francesco Laparelli visited the Cittadella in order to modernize it, but nothing materialized since at the time the Order was busy constructing its new capital Valletta on mainland Malta. The Cittadella was attacked again by corsairs in 1583. St. John's Bastion as seen from the ditch In 1599, a major reconstruction of the Cittadella begun, under designs of the military engineer Giovanni Rinaldini and under the direction of Vittorio Cassar. The southern walls of the city were completely rebuilt as a bastioned enceinte with a single bastion and two demi-bastions linked by curtain walls, along with two cavaliers, a ditch and outworks. Parts of the northern walls were also rebuilt by the Hospitallers, although they retained a medieval form. The walls surrounding the suburb Rabat were probably demolished at this point. The reconstruction to Rinaldini's and Cassar's designs was completed in around 1622. Gozo's population stayed within the walls of the Cittadella between dusk and dawn until this curfew was lifted on 15 April 1637. The castle remained the only fortified refuge against attack for the island's inhabitants until Fort Chambray was built in the mid-18th century. Soon after the reconstruction was complete, the Cittadella's defences were again criticized. In the 1640s, plans were made to demolish the citadel and build a new fortress at Marsalforn. Mines were actually built under the bastions to destroy them, if necessary, but the demolition was never done. The engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga suggested to rebuild the wall around the suburb and further strengthen the Cittadella, but there were no funds for this proposal. By the early 18th century the Cittadella had assumed the role of a fortress, with a significant proportion of its houses falling into ruin or being in a poor state. An attack on Gozo took place in 1708, and, in 1715, the engineer Louis François d'Aubigné de Tigné made the same suggestions as Valperga, but a lack of funds prevented any work from being carried out. =French occupation and British rule= Gozo Aqueduct obelisk near the Cittadella On 10 June 1798, the Maltese Islands were invaded by the French. Troops led by Jean Reynier landed near Ramla in the early afternoon, and part of the 95th Demi-Brigade marched to the Cittadella. The fortress held out for some time, but by nightfall it fell to the invaders. The invasion was followed by a French military occupation, but within three months discontent among the population led to revolt on the main island of Malta. The Gozitans rebelled on 3 September, and the French garrison withdrew to the Cittadella, until they capitulated on 28 October after some negotiations. A day later, the British transferred control of the Cittadella to the Gozitans, who set up a provisional government led by Saverio Cassar and briefly administered the island as the independent state La Nazione Gozitana. When the Gozo Aqueduct was built between 1839 and 1843, a water reservoir was constructed in the Cittadella's ditch. A commemorative obelisk was also built near the reservoir. A road leading from it-Tokk to the Cittadella was constructed in 1854, allowing easier access to the fortified city. The Royal Malta Fencible Regiment moved its Gozo headquarters from the Cittadella to Fort Chambray in 1856, and the fortifications of the Cittadella were decommissioned by the British on 1 April 1868. The Cittadella's fortifications and the ruined buildings within the city were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. During World War II, air raid shelters were dug under the bastions of the Cittadella. =Recent history= Restoration works at the Cittadella in 2015 The Cittadella's fortifications, including part of the medieval enceinte, are intact. The southern part of the city, where the cathedral and other buildings are located, is in good condition, but the buildings in the northern part are largely in ruins. Most of these ruins date back to the medieval period, and they contain archaeological deposits. Since 1998, the citadel has been included on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2006, the first plans were made to restore the Cittadella, as part of a project that also included the restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu and Mdina on mainland Malta. The restoration of the Cittadella consisted of two projects which were co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund. The first was aimed at stabilizing and consolidating the fortifications and their underlying bedrock, and it began in 2008. This project was undertaken by the Restoration Unit at a cost of around €7 million. Entrance to the Cittadella Visitors' Centre. Remains of medieval walls can be seen on the lower left The second project was undertaken by the Ministry for Gozo between 2014 and 2016 at a cost of €14 million. The façades of the main buildings in the Cittadella were restored, while the ruins were acquired by the government and were cleaned and consolidated. The piazza and streets were paved, and the ditch was rehabilitated as a leisure area. A breach in the bastions was closed off with a door, and accessibility and safety measures were undertaken. The 19th-century reservoir in the ditch was also converted into the Cittadella Visitors' Centre, with this project being entrusted to Martin Xuereb & Associates and Sarner International. The restored Cittadella was inaugurated on 30 June 2016. The Cittadella Visitors' Centre has won multiple local and international awards since its inauguration. During the course of restoration, various architectural features and archaeological remains were unearthed. A small structure consisting of two sets of stones in circular arrangements was discovered in Cathedral Square in December 2014. Its age and purpose are unknown. Bronze Age silos were also rediscovered. Parts of the Hospitaller fortifications which had been obscured by British interventions in the mid-19th century were also rediscovered during the restoration works. These include a ramp with a drawbridge which served as the original entrance to the fortress, and a sally port within a flank of St. Michael's Bastion. The archaeological discoveries were incorporated into the final design of the project. Architecture View of the Cittadella from the east The Cittadella is built on a promontory overlooking the present day city of Victoria. This location was originally chosen because it is a naturally defensible hill, dominating the surrounding countryside and having views of large parts of the coastline. =Fortifications= The fortifications of the Cittadella consist of a semi-circular enceinte in the northern end of the city, and bastions linked together with curtain walls in the south. The northern walls are built on the perimeter of the natural plateau, so they were difficult to attack. They were originally built in the 15th century, although large portions of the walls were rebuilt by the Hospitallers or in modern times. The northern walls include the remains of a collapsed medieval wall tower, a blocked-up sally port, a lookout post and some walled-up windows. Masonry revetments are built in depressions within the cliff face below the northern walls. The medieval sally port on northern enceinte of the Cittadella The southern perimeter of the city consists of a 17th-century bastioned enceinte which was built by the Hospitallers. A large arrowhead-shaped bastion known as St. Michael's Bastion is built at the southernmost end of the city, while two demi-bastions – St. Martin's and St. John's Demi-Bastions – are located at the west and east ends of the city. Flat-roofed échauguettes are built on the salient of each demi-bastion. St. Michael's Bastion also had an echaugette but this was replaced by a clock tower in 1858. A small gunpowder magazine is located at the junction between St. John's Demi-Bastion and the medieval enceinte. St. Martin's Demi-Bastion The bastions are linked together by curtain walls. The one between St. Martin's Demi-Bastion and St. Michael's Bastion contains the Main Gate, a modern arched opening and a clock tower. The wall between St. Michael's Bastion and St. John's Demi-Bastion is known as St. Philip's Curtain, and its upper part contains slit-like openings which open into a series of magazines which are now used as craft shops. These rooms support a walkway along the ramparts. St. John's Cavalier and the cathedral Cavaliers were also built close to each demi-bastion. St. Martin's Cavalier is located between the medieval enceinte and St. Martin's Demi-Bastion, and it is only partially intact, its upper portions having been pulled down. St. John's Cavalier, which is found near St. John's Demi-Bastion and the rear of the cathedral, was completed in 1614. A freestanding room was constructed on its roof in 1701 for use as a gunpowder magazine. A pentagonal artillery battery known as the Low Battery is grafted below the walls at the easternmost extremity of the fortress, close to St. John's Demi-Bastion. The southern perimeter of the Cittadella is surrounded by a ditch, which originally extended from St. Martin's Demi-Bastion to the Low Battery but now begins at St. Michael's Bastion due to 19th-century alterations. A covertway with a single place-of-arms runs along the ditch. A steep glacis was located outside the covertway, but this has been built up. A small triangular ravelin stands near the entrance to the city, but this has lost most of its original stonework and has been converted into a garden, losing its legibility as part of the fortress in the process. =Churches= Cathedral of the Assumption One of the major landmarks in the Cittadella is the Cathedral of the Assumption, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gozo. According to tradition, it stands on the site of a Roman temple dedicated to Juno, which was eventually converted to a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The cathedral is believed to have been destroyed after the Maltese islands fell to the Arabs. A second church was built in the medieval period, and the earliest mentions of a parish church within the Cittadella date back to the 13th century. This church was enlarged in the 15th and 16th centuries, and it was damaged in the 1551 attack, although it was repaired within a few years. The building was damaged during the 1693 Sicily earthquake, and it was subsequently demolished to make way for the present structure, which is a Baroque building constructed between 1697 and 1711 to designs of Lorenzo Gafà, a Maltese architect who also built the Cathedral of Mdina on mainland Malta. Extensive remains of a Roman temple were found during construction, and some remains from this era still survive beneath the cathedral. The church became a cathedral with the establishment of the diocese of Gozo in 1864. Today, the building is most famous for a remarkable trompe l'oeil on its ceiling, which depicts the interior of a dome that was never built. This was painted by the Sicilian artist Antonio Manuele. A small building behind the cathedral houses the Cathedral Museum. The Chapel of St. Joseph and the Cagliares Palace, as seen from the ruins in the northern part of the Cittadella Two chapels are also found inside the Cittadella. The Chapel of St. Joseph, known as ta' fuq is-sur (\\"on the bastions\\"), was originally built in around the 11th century, and it was dedicated to Nicholas of Bari. The present building was built in 1625, possibly to designs of Vittorio Cassar, and it might incorporate parts of the original chapel. The other chapel is dedicated to Saint Barbara, and it is known as \\"within the Walls\\". Its site was originally occupied by a chapel dedicated to John the Baptist, but this was deconsecrated in 1575. The site was given to the Confraternity of St. Barbara in 1598, who built the existing chapel in the early 17th century, during the magistracy of Alof de Wignacourt and around the same time when the fortifications were being reconstructed. This chapel is annexed to the cathedral. Other chapels dedicated to Saint Lawrence and Our Saviour existed within the Cittadella during the medieval period. These were deconsecrated following Inquisitor Pietro Dusina's visit in 1575, and no remains have survived today. =Other buildings= The Law Courts, formerly the Governor's Palace, with the Old Prison visible to the left The main square of the Cittadella, which is known as Pjazza tal-Katidral (Cathedral Square), contains the Law Courts. These are housed in two buildings, one of which was purpose-built as a courthouse, and another, which was formerly the Governor's Palace, built in the early 17th century. Opposite the Governor's Palace is the Bishop's Palace. Adjoining the Chapel of St. Joseph, there is a residential palace that was built by Bishop Baldassare Cagliares in 1620. A fountain against a wall is a commemoration of the naming of the city as Victoria, the then Queen of Great Britain, on 10 June 1887. The following buildings are now open to the public as museums: *The Old Prison, located behind the Law Courts, which was used as a prison from the 16th century to 1962. It contains well-preserved prison cells and other exhibitions. *The Gozo Nature Museum, which is dedicated to Gozo's geography, geology and natural science. It is located within a group of 17th-century houses which, at times, had been used as an inn. *The Gozo Museum of Archaeology, which is dedicated to Gozitan history from the prehistoric to medieval periods, is located within a 17th-century house that was originally known as Casa Bondi. *Gran Castello Historic House, which is dedicated to Gozitan folklore. It is housed in a cluster of early 16th-century houses. These four museums are run by Heritage Malta.

It takes the form of a parable about forgiveness. Synopsis The story opens at the beginning of Holy Week, when there was still melting snow on the ground. An older girl, Akulya, and a younger girl, Malasha, go outside to play. They both have just been given new frocks, but they insist on wading through one of the puddles from the melting snow. They both take off their shoes to keep them dry, and Akulya warns Malasha against splashing the water on her new frock. Malasha splashes Akulya despite her warning, and Akulya runs home in tears. Her mother is furious at the ruined frock, and she spanks Malasha in the middle of the street. Soon Malasha's mother emerges from her home, and the mothers begin arguing. The shouts brought the peasants into the street, who also begin arguing with each other. The peasants start pushing each other, and Akulya's grandmother urges everyone to stop, but to no avail. In the meantime, Akulya had washed off her frock, and she and Malasha returned to the pool. The two girls make a small boat out of bark, and they make a stream from the puddle. They go chasing after the boat together, as happy as ever. Akulya's grandmother urges everyone to follow the example of the children, and take their spirit of forgiveness into their own hearts.

The use of the forward measure was pioneered by Farshid Jamshidian (1987), and later used as a means of calculating the price of options on bonds.

If Q_* is the risk neutral measure, then the forward measure Q_T is defined via the Radon–Nikodym derivative given by :\\\\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} = \\\\frac{1}{B(T) E_{Q_*}[1/B(T)]} = \\\\frac{D(T)}{E_{Q_*}[D(T)]}. Note that this implies that the forward measure and the risk neutral measure coincide when interest rates are deterministic. Also, this is a particular form of the change of numeraire formula by changing the numeraire from the money market or bank account B(t) to a T-maturity bond P(t,T). Indeed, if in general :P(t,T) = E_{Q_*}\\\\left[\\\\frac{B(t)}{B(T)}\\\\mathcal{F}(t)\\\\right] = E_{Q_*}\\\\left[\\\\frac{D(T)}{D(t)}\\\\mathcal{F}(t)\\\\right] is the price of a zero coupon bond at time t for maturity T, where \\\\mathcal{F}(t) is the filtration denoting market information at time t, then we can write :\\\\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} = \\\\frac{B(0) P(T,T)}{B(T) P(0,T)} from which it is indeed clear that the forward T measure is associated to the T-maturity zero coupon bond as numeraire.

For example, the discounted stock price is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure: :S(t) D(t) = E_{Q_*}[D(T)S(T)  \\\\mathcal{F}(t)].\\\\, The forward price is given by F_S(t,T) = \\\\frac{S(t)}{P(t,T)}. Thus, we have F_S(T,T)=S(T) :F_S(t,T) = \\\\frac{E_{Q_*}[D(T)S(T)  \\\\mathcal{F}(t)]}{D(t) P(t,T)}= E_{Q_T}[F_S(T,T)  \\\\mathcal{F}(t)]\\\\frac{E_{Q_*}[D(T)\\\\mathcal{F}(t)]}{D(t) P(t,T)} by using the Radon-Nikodym derivative \\\\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} and the equality F_S(T,T)=S(T). The last term is equal to unity by definition of the bond price so that we get :F_S(t,T) = E_{Q_T}[F_S(T,T)\\\\mathcal{F}(t)].\\\\, References * See also *Risk-neutral measure *Forward price Category:Finance theories Category:Mathematical finance Category:Martingale theory ","title":"Forward measure"},{"id":"9795291","text":"Written by Baroness Orczy and first published in 1915, The Bronze Eagle: A Story of the Hundred Days, is a romance set in France following the period of the Revolution and the expulsion of the Bourbons. Its central plot lies in the intrigues of their followers and those of Napoleon Bonaparte. The novel was also published serially under the title of Waterloo. Plot summary Crystal, the only daughter of the old, long-exiled haughty royalist, the Comte de Cambray, is on the eve of betrothal to de Marmont, (secretly an ardent Bonapartist). Bobby Clyffurde, the Englishman, who is in love with Crystal, confronts Victor de Marmont about why he is pretending to be a royalist. De Marmont replies that he has never led the Comte to suppose anything, the Comte has merely taken de Marmont’s political convictions for granted. As if two potential suitors weren’t enough, Crystal has yet another admirer, Maurice de St. Genis, whose impecunious state (her father sees him as a penniless, out- at-elbows, good for nothing) has precluded him from obtaining her hand in marriage. However at the moment of Crystal’s betrothal to de Marmont, Maurice finally gets his revenge upon his rival. Once the guests have assembled for the ceremony, there is a disturbance from the end of the corridor and St. Genis enters the room, his rough clothes and muddy boots providing a contrast to the immaculate get-up of the Comte’s guests. Looking flushed and clutching his cane he announces that he has only come to avert the awful catastrophe that is about to fall on the Comte and his family. At the young man’s ominous words, M. le Comte goes pale and demands to know what catastrophe could be worse than twenty years of exile? \\"An alliance with a traitor, M. le Comte\\" he replies. St. Genis goes on to accuse his rival of pinning Napoleon’s proclamation on the walls of Grenoble. Yet, rather than deny the accusation de Marmont defends his actions with fervor, pulling a copy of the declaration from his pocket and waving it at the assembled group while shouting “Vive l’Empereur”. Despite the sudden rupture of her engagement, Crystal‘s heart is by no means broken, but it is not St. Genis who in the end wins her love, for we are left with the understanding that it is Clyffurde, the English merchant who eventually overrides the prejudices of the old French count. Clyffurde laughingly asks Crystal’s aunt, Mme. la Duchesse “Do you think that if I promise never to buy or sell gloves again, but in future to try and live like a gentleman-he will consent?” External links Category:1915 British novels Category:Historical novels Category:Novels by Baroness Emma Orczy Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ","title":"The Bronze Eagle"},{"id":"9795315","text":"In 1983, Facets Multi-Media founded the Chicago International Children's Film Festival (CICFF), the first competitive festival of films for children in the U.S. The impetus for the Festival came from a need to introduce new, culturally diverse films for children to American children's audiences, and to recognize excellence in children's filmmaking. In addition, the Festival sought to empower children by involving them directly in the jurying process. From its inception, the Festival has had independent juries of children and adult media professionals awarding prizes in multiple categories. The Chicago International Children's Film Festival is the largest annual festival of films for children (ages 2–16) in the world, programming 250 films and videos from 40 countries. With 25,000 children, adults and educators and over 100 filmmakers, programmers and celebrities each year, the Festival is one of the only Academy Award-qualifying children's film festivals. The Festival is held every October at various theatrical venues around Chicago, Illinois. Activities *Facets Kids Film Camp *Year-round Screenings Facets Children's Programs feature year-round screenings for parents and groups, presenting unique multicultural short films for children as catalysts for improving fundamental skills such as literacy, writing, critical thinking and inference. *Dream Screen Dream Screen is a workshop that teaches children to create their own stories and to animate them using drawn and cutout animation.

Born to a noble Gallo-Roman family at Vannes, Brittany, St. Albinus was a monk and from 504 C.E. Abbot of Tintillac (which no longer stands; its location has not been satisfactorily identified). His reputation spread during the twenty-five years in which he served as abbot. In 529, St. Albinus was elected, against his wishes, Bishop of Angers.* Episcopate He campaigned against incestuous weddings, such as those that occurred between members of the nobility.* He participated in the Third Council of Orléans (538) after King Childebert granted permission for this council to take place. Albinus sought advice from St. Caesarius of Arles after seeing laxity in other bishops. Tradition states that he helped all in distress, using diocesan funds to free hostages from pirates. Another tradition states that he clashed with King Childebert, who had imprisoned a woman called Etherie, from Douille near Angers. Unable to secure her release Albinus visited her in prison, and the soldier who tried to resist him fell dead at his feet. This so impressed the king that he allowed St. Albinus to bail her out.*\\"A Life of St. Aubin and His Times\\" by Rosemary Hampton Another legend relates that St. Albinus once prayed far into the night for some men imprisoned in the Tower of Angers. Suddenly a great stone collapsed from the wall, allowing their escape.*Venantius Fortunatus \\"The Life of St. Aubin\\" Death and burial St. Albinus died in 550 and was buried in the church of Saint-Pierre at Angers. In 556, a church was dedicated to him and his body was buried in its crypt. Near this church an abbey arose, called Saint-Aubin.* Veneration Saint-Aubin, Angers. St. Gregory of Tours remarks on the cult of St. Albinus, which later became diffused in Germany, England, and Poland, making St. Albinus a popular saint during the Middle Ages.* St. Venantius Fortunatus, a near contemporary, wrote a life of this saint.* Churches were dedicated to him right across the continent as far as Poland, and he was sometimes seen as the patron saint for protection from pirate attack. This may have been based on the tradition that he bought back parishioners who had been taken captive by pirates sailing up the Loire river. Later the tradition was reinforced by a miracle recorded in the 10th century, when the walled town of Guérande, near the mouth of the Loire, prayed to St. Albinus for help and found their attackers miraculously defeated. In the Middle Ages, Nicholas Belfort notably wrote describing miracles performed at the tomb of St. Aubin after the year 1000 AD. Belfort was a Regular Canon in the monastery of St John the Baptist by the city of Soissons.*John Dodd \\"The Life of St. Aubin\\" Thus, his fame increased and many coastal villages chose Aubin as their patron saint. Presumably this is the reason why St. Aubin in Jersey bears his name, preserving the name of an ancient chapel that has long since disappeared. St. Aubin is venerated there in the Anglican church of St Aubin on the Hill. (See Saint-Aubin for other places named for him.)

Nguyen (born May 1, 1976) is an American politician who served in the California State Senate. A Republican, she represented the 34th district, encompassing parts of Long Beach and Orange County. She is the first Vietnamese-American state senator in the United States and the country's first Vietnamese-American woman state legislator. Prior to being elected to the state senate, she was an Orange County Supervisor, representing the First District. At the age of 30, she was the youngest person to be elected to the board of supervisors, the first woman to be elected from the First District, and the first Vietnamese-American county supervisor in the United States. She won her supervisor seat following a historic special election where two Vietnamese-American candidates received half of the total votes cast in a field of 10, separated from each other by only 7 votes. She was sworn in on March 27, 2007, after a lengthy court battle. She won a full, four-year term in 2008 in another historic election when all three major candidates were Vietnamese Americans. She was reelected to a third term in 2012. In a major upset, she was narrowly defeated by former Assemblyman Tom Umberg in the 2018 elections. Prior to her election to the Board of Supervisors, she served as a Garden Grove City Council Member and at age 28, was the youngest person ever elected to that body, until Kim Nguyen (no relation) was elected at 25 in 2016. Personal life Nguyen was born in Saigon, South Vietnam, on May 1, 1976, roughly one year after the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. Her family joined millions of others in becoming boat people when she was five, coming to California in 1981. They first lived in San Bernardino, but settled in Garden Grove in early 1990s. She attended the University of California, Irvine, at first to become a doctor but later majored in political science after she was inspired by then-Supervisor Bill Steiner. She is married to Tom Bonikowski, Jr., with whom she has two sons, Thomas III and Timothy. 2007 special election The election of Supervisor Lou Correa to the California State Senate in the 2006 election left his supervisorial seat vacant. Ten candidates filed for the seat in the February 6, 2007 special election, including three Vietnamese Americans, who were all Republicans. While the 1st District Supervisorial seat is officially non-partisan, the leading candidate was California State Assemblyman Tom Umberg (who had just left office two months before), a Democrat who had the full support of the labor unions. While the Republican Party did not officially endorse a candidate, most party leaders were backing Santa Ana City Councilman Carlos Bustamante. With three Vietnamese-American candidates, the large Vietnamese-American community who comprise a quarter of registered voters in the First District was galvanized. Janet Nguyen's main opponent, Garden Grove Unified School District Trustee Trung Nguyen, had the support of State Assemblyman Van Tran. Issues that the candidates discussed included illegal immigration to the United States, one that county supervisors do not have the authority to affect. The debate was particularly heated within the Vietnamese-American community, with accusations flying back and forth between the two Nguyen camps. Trung Nguyen was insulted as a \\"fob\\" and his campaign photoshopped Trung Nguyen in a photo next to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger while Janet Nguyen was criticized for not being fluent in Vietnamese. Pundits speculated that the three Vietnamese-American candidates would split the Vietnamese-American vote, allowing Umberg to easily win the election. With high absentee voter turnout among the Vietnamese- American community, it became clear on election night that Janet Nguyen and Trung Nguyen were leading. Umberg and Bustamante were in third and fourth place, respectively, and quickly conceded defeat. At the end of the night, Janet Nguyen was leading by 52 votes. When all the votes were counted on the following day, however, Trung Nguyen was leading by seven votes. Janet Nguyen requested a recount, and the final result was 10,919 votes for Janet Nguyen and 10,912 votes for Trung Nguyen. Janet Nguyen was certified the winner. However, Trung Nguyen's lawyers filed lawsuit challenging the recount, alleging that the Registrar of Voters improperly voided votes for him and awarded votes to Janet Nguyen in the recount. The Board of Supervisors postponed inaugurating Janet Nguyen pending the lawsuit. On March 26, she was named the winner, winning by just 3 votes. She was sworn into office on March 27, 2007. After losing the lawsuit in the Orange County Superior Court, Trung Nguyen's lawyers filed an appeal to the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth District, Division Three. The Court of Appeal ruled against Trung Nguyen and upheld the Superior Court's decision. Refusing to stop there, Trung Nguyen's lawyers filed an appeal to the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court denied to hear the appeal. 2008 election While special elections for Orange County Supervisor are decided by plurality vote, regular elections for Orange County Supervisor are decided by majority vote. Should no candidate capture a majority of the vote, then the top two candidates advance to a run-off election. In light of the closeness of her initial election in 2007, it was widely expected that Janet Nguyen would be forced into a November 2008 run-off election. However, Janet Nguyen won 56.6% of the vote in the June 2008 election, avoiding a November run-off. Garden Grove Councilwoman Dina Nguyen, a fellow Republican who received the strong support of Assemblyman Van Tran and his machine (including former candidate, Trung Nguyen), won only 27.7% of the vote while Democratic activist Hoa Van Tran won 15.7% of the vote. 2014 State Senate election In 2014, incumbent Democratic state Senator Lou Correa was term-limited, creating a vacancy. Republican leaders quickly rallied around Nguyen while the state Democratic establishment rallied around former state Assemblyman Jose Solorio. The ensuing election was the most expensive in the state, and at times featured accusations and aggressive negative advertising. The vote was expected to be close, but Nguyen won the November election by a 58% to 42% margin, surprising even her fellow Republicans. She became the first State Senator of Vietnamese ancestry in American history. Removal from California Senate floor after criticizing Tom Hayden On February 23, 2017, Senator Nguyen was forcibly removed from the Senate floor on Thursday morning during an attempt to criticize the late California Sen. Tom Hayden and called him a communist. She rose to criticize his stance as \\"an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War [who] made celebrated trips to North Vietnam and Cambodia, offering to help broker a peaceful end.\\" She spoke first in Vietnamese and then in English, all whilst repeatedly being told by presiding Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, that she was out of order. After she continued speaking her microphone was turned off. Senator Nguyen continued anyway, and Lara later ordered a sergeant-at-arms to escort her out of the room. The entire episode was caught on video, and elicited serious criticism from the Senate GOP Caucus, particularly in the shadow of a similar censure of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren during the confirmation hearings of Jeff Sessions.

Pickard (June 25, 1913 - August 4, 1993) was an American actor who appeared primarily in television westerns. Early life Pickard was born in Lascassas in Rutherford County, near Murfreesboro in Middle Tennessee. He graduated from the Nashville Conservatory in Nashville, Tennessee. His first acting roles were small parts in films, mostly uncredited, beginning in 1936 as a dueling soldier in the picture Mary of Scotland, based on the 16th century queen, Mary of Scotland. From 1942 to 1946, Pickard served in the United States Navy, having been the model for naval recruitment posters during World War II. Career Pickard returned to acting after the war and appeared in supporting roles in scores of westerns and action dramas before landing the starring role in the syndicated television series, Boots and Saddles, set on an Arizona fort in the late 19th century. His second film role, also uncredited, came in John Wayne's Wake of the Red Witch (1948). Pickard's first television guest-starring roles were in crime dramas in 1951 and 1952, respectively -- Racket Squad, with Reed Hadley, and Boston Blackie. In 1954, he guest starred on the legal drama, The Public Defender, again with Reed Hadley.

Pickard appeared on Hopalong Cassidy and in 1956 on the CBS children’s western My Friend Flicka. That same year he was cast in another anthology series, Navy Log, and in an episode of Jack Webb's NBC series, Dragnet. He appeared in a 1956 episode of the TV Series The Lone Ranger entitled \\"Trouble at Tylerville\\". From 1957 to 1958, he filled the lead role of Captain Shank Adams on Boots and Saddles, with episodes set in the Arizona Territory on a United States Army fort. Afterwards, Pickard guest starred in many more westerns including the role of the gunfighter Johnny Ringo on The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, starring Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp.

While in an ordinary town anyone may buy property, in a community settlement the village's residents are organized in a cooperative. They have the power to approve or veto a sale of a house or a business to any buyer. Residents of a community settlement may have a particular shared ideology, religious perspective, or desired lifestyle which they wish to perpetuate by accepting only like-minded individuals. For example, a family-oriented community settlement that wishes to avoid becoming a retirement community may choose to accept only young married couples as new residents. As distinct from the traditional Israeli development village, typified by the kibbutz and moshav, the community settlement emerged in the 1970s as a non-political movement for new urban settlements in Israel.Aharon Kellerman, Society and Settlement: Jewish Land of Israel in the Twentieth Century, SUNY Press 2012 pp.94-102. But it essentially took shape as a new typology for settling the West Bank and the Galilee as part of the goal of establishing a 'demographic balance' between Jews and Arabs. In 2013, there were 118 community settlements with total population of 84,800 residents. History View of Mikhmanim View of Ahuzat Barak The first community settlement in Israel was Neve Monosson, in the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area, which was established in 1953. From 1977, the Likud led government supported expansion of Israeli Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Within a few years, community settlements were the most common localities in those regions. In 1981, the first such town, Timrat was established in the Galilee region. According to Gershom Gorenberg, the term was adopted for a type of West Bank Israeli settlement by a 'maverick planner' in the Gush Emunim movement. The settlement of Ofra was to form the model for later community settlements, whose founders wished to create a community that broke with the socialist model, one where people could farm privately, run businesses, or use the exclusive exurb village to commute to work in the metropolis. All residents were to share an \\"ideological-social background. The planning envisaged nuclear family housing in an amenable natural ambiance. The sum total of people in any such community was planned to be restricted to no more than a few hundred families.Gershom Gorenberg, Occupied Territories: The Untold Story of Israel's Settlements, I.B.Tauris, 2006 pp.353,368. A seminal role in the extension of the model into the Palestinian territories was played by the World Zionist Organization (WZO) and Amanah, Gush Emunim's settlement branch in the West Bank.Eyal Weizman, Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation, Verso Books, 2012 pp.125-130. Recognition of these exurbs as community settlements developed only gradually, since they differed from the standard norms of being 'cooperative' and 'productive'. Gush Emunim pushed this type of settlement, designed in dense networks, because it was best suited to hilly terrain, where agricultural and water resources were poor, and where the density of Palestinian habitation high. Life was based on family networks and partial cooperation, adapted to housing white-collar people with jobs in Israel.Elisha Efrat, The West Bank and Gaza Strip: A Geography of Occupation and Disengagement, Routledge 2006 pp.31,37-8, pp95-6. According to Elisha Efrat, Gush Emunim intended to establish Israeli Jewish settlement as an irreversible reality in the Palestinian territories. The mountain strip community settlements were developed in two strategically parallel lines: the first central string of settlements runs parallel to the main road connecting the five major Arab cities of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem and Hebron, while the second, east to the watershed, runs parallel to the Allon Highway. The objective of this design is to create blockages hindering Palestinians from expanding their towns in the direction of the road, and impeding the conurbation of their communities lying on either sides of the road. The concept was institutionalized in the Drobless Plan (1978) drawn up by the WZO, which set down the guidelines for thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank.Leila Farsakh, Palestinian Labour Migration to Israel: Labour, Land and Occupation, Routledge 2005 pp.48-51. The first community settlement, Ofra, was established in 1975, and four of the first five settlements were unauthorized. The reevaluation and recognition of such settlements as cooperative associations was based on the ascendancy to government of the Likud party, which seconded the rapid growth of closed exurbs in which religious nationalists played a dominant role. The Gush Emunim plan was eventually adopted by both the World Zionist Organization and Israel's Ministry of Agriculture. With the ascendancy of the Likud Party, community settlements rapidly expanded in number: by 1987, there were a total of 95 and two years later, most of the 115 settlements established were of this kind. Such settlements were also attractive as destinations for \\"quality of life\\" secularists, for whom easy commuting to their metropolitan workplaces and the low cost of housing in settlements were notable incentives. Community settlements are in Israeli legal terms cooperative associations: in practice they have been defined as 'private, members-only suburban village(s)'. While in an ordinary village anyone may buy property, in a community settlement the village's residents, who are organized in a cooperative, have approval (or veto power) over any sale of a house or a business. Each community settlement has its own selection process for admitting residents, together with mechanisms for monitoring all aspects of communal life, from religious observance and ideological rigour, to how one uses the land outside one's home. Warnings accompany observed failures to live up to the principles of the community, and, if not taken into account, can lead to expulsion. The design of these principles arose out of a perceived necessity of impeding Palestinian Israelis from residing in such settlements. Monitoring may have a particular shared ideology, religious perspective, or desired lifestyle which they wish to perpetuate by accepting only like-minded individuals. In West Bank community settlements, single-family housing with private yards, which are emblems of status, are the most common residential type. Unlike kibbutzim and moshavim, community settlements generally lack any agriculture and depend on residents commuting elsewhere for employment. In this sense, they serve primarily as dormitory towns or quarters. Legal structure View of Eshhar Legally, a community settlement operates as a cooperative in which all property-owning residents must be members. To enforce the restrictions on reselling property, property on a community settlement is formally not sold, but rather leased. The land of the entire settlement is owned by one entity (usually the Jewish National Fund through the Israel Land Administration), which leases out individual plots only to members of the cooperative. In that sense, a community settlement is much like a village-sized housing cooperative. Israeli law bans the allocation of land resources on a preferential basis. According to Eyal Weizman, the community settlement system developed techniques to bypass those laws by having state land, either in Israel or in the Palestinian territories, placed in the custody of legal bodies registered in the United States, Jewish Agency or the World Zionist Organization. By this means, he asserts, the state of Israel was 'enabled to circumvent its own laws'. The residents cooperative may also own private businesses and service industries within or in proximity to the settlement. These are often used for keeping certain public facilities, such as preschool, synagogues, grocery stores, sport facilities, youth clubs, swimming pools, etc., in the hands of the entire community. However, unlike a kibbutz or a moshav, the economic cooperation between residents is very loose - most residents work outside the settlement, and residents only pay minimal property taxes to the cooperative to help maintain the village and its public facilities. Note that despite a popular misconception, the mere existence of community-owned facilities is not what differentiates community settlements from ordinary villages, as most ordinary villages also have the same types of facilities - preschool, synagogues, sport centers and sometimes even swimming pools - owned and operated by the village. Likewise, the mere existence of a democratic body of residents which makes decisions and organizes events for the whole community is not a defining feature of community settlements: Ordinary villages also have their own local governments which are democratically elected by their residents. Most community settlements are small, typically amounting to communities of 50-500 families, and are therefore too small to form their own separate formal municipalities. Instead, the residents' cooperative is recognized by the state of Israel as a local committee. Several such local committees can, for example, form together a regional council, which is one of the three types of local government in Israel. In practice, the regional council often has more impact on the resident's life than the cooperative of their own settlement: It is the regional council which will normally run schools, build roads, collect property taxes, and even run its own screening process. Controversy To permanently move to a community settlement, potential residents must join the cooperative. An interview and acceptance process is often required to join the cooperative and move into the community. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has claimed that this screening process is designed to deny membership to Arabs, and that sometimes Jews of specific ethnic or socio-economic groups are also discriminated against.

It was issued in a revised edition by Ballantine Books as the twenty-fourth volume of their Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in January 1971. The original text was returned to print by Gollancz in 2002. Plot The book tells the story of Skafloc, elven-fosterling and originally son of Orm the Strong. The story begins with the marriage of Orm the Strong and Aelfrida of the English. Orm kills a witch's family on the land and later half-converts to Christianity, but quarrels with the local priest and sends him off the land. Meanwhile, an elf named Imric, with the help of the witch, seeks to capture the newly born son of Orm. In his place, Imric leaves a changeling called Valgard. The real son of Orm is taken away to elven lands and named Skafloc by the elves who raise him. As the story continues, both Skafloc and Valgard have significant roles in the war between the trolls and the elves. Reception Anthony Boucher praised the original edition as \\"a magnificent saga of the interplay of gods, demigods, faerie, heroes and men.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, February 1955, pp.97. Groff Conklin described the novel as \\"a rip-snorting, bloody, imitation-Norse epic containing all the elements of faerie\\".\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, May 1955, p.115 Michael Moorcock declared The Broken Sword superior to Tolkien, calling it \\"a fast-paced doom-drenched tragedy in which human heroism, love and ambition, manipulated by amoral gods, elves and trolls, led inevitably to tragic consequences.\\" E. F. Bleiler, commenting on the revised edition, declared that \\"The first portion of this novel is perhaps the finest American heroic fantasy, with good characterizations, excellent surface detail, good plotting, and an admirable recreation of the mood of the Old Norse literature. But the story ends in a mad scramble and unconvincing slaughter\\".E. F. Bleiler, The Guide to Supernatural Fiction, Kent State University Press, 1983, pp .5-6 Influences and adaptation The novel is set during the Viking Age and the story contains many references to the Norse mythology. It is often described as a successor to the 1891 novel The Saga of Eric Brighteyes, by H. Rider Haggard. A partial adaptation of the novel, done as a serialized black-and-white graphic novel, was adapted by fantasy writer Tom Reamy and illustrated by professional fantasy artist George Barr. This was published during the mid-to-late 1960s over several issues of Reamy's twice Hugo Award-nominated science fiction fanzine Trumpet; the adaptation was never completed, though there were revived plans underway to do so at the time of Reamy's death in late 1977. British fantasy writer Michael Moorcock has written that The Broken Sword greatly influenced his stories; Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné series features a magic sword, Stormbringer, which has many similarities to Skafloc's sword.

He was officially inducted on February 13, 2017. In his induction speech, Goebel spoke about the difficult decision to become a full-time touring pro: :\\"In 1988, I had been a pro bowler for eight years and didn't have a title. I quit my job and decided if I was ever going to be a pro, I had to do it now. I missed a cut and came home whining. My wife Kelly said, 'well, you quit your job; you’d better go out and bowl better.’\\" PBA50 Tour After participating in 50 tournaments on the PBA50 Tour without a win, Goebel won his first PBA50 Tour title on May 16, 2017 at the PBA50 Miller Lite Players Championship in Indianapolis. This is considered a major title for PBA50 players. Qualifying as the #2 seed, Goebel defeated top seed and fellow PBA Hall of Famer Parker Bohn III in the final match.

This law of motion is most commonly paraphrased as: \\"For every action force there is an equal, but opposite, reaction force.\\" Examples include jet engines, rocket engines, pump-jet, and more uncommon variations such as Hall effect thrusters, ion drives, mass drivers, and nuclear pulse propulsion. Energy use =Propulsive efficiency= For all reaction engines that carry on-board propellant (such as rocket engines and electric propulsion drives) some energy must go into accelerating the reaction mass. Every engine wastes some energy, but even assuming 100% efficiency, the engine needs energy amounting to :\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\end{matrix} MV_e^2 (where M is the mass of propellent expended and V_e is the exhaust velocity), which is simply the energy to accelerate the exhaust. Due to energy carried away in the exhaust the energy efficiency of a reaction engine varies with the speed of the exhaust relative to the speed of the vehicle, this is called propulsive efficiency, blue is the curve for rocket-like reaction engines, red is for air-breathing (duct) reaction engines Comparing the rocket equation (which shows how much energy ends up in the final vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows that even with 100% engine efficiency, certainly not all energy supplied ends up in the vehicle – some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic energy of the exhaust. If the specific impulse (I_{sp}) is fixed, for a mission delta-v, there is a particular I_{sp} that minimises the overall energy used by the rocket. This comes to an exhaust velocity of about ⅔ of the mission delta-v (see the energy computed from the rocket equation). Drives with a specific impulse that is both high and fixed such as Ion thrusters have exhaust velocities that can be enormously higher than this ideal, and thus end up powersource limited and give very low thrust. Where the vehicle performance is power limited, e.g. if solar power or nuclear power is used, then in the case of a large v_{e} the maximum acceleration is inversely proportional to it. Hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to v_{e}. Thus the latter should not be too large. On the other hand, if the exhaust velocity can be made to vary so that at each instant it is equal and opposite to the vehicle velocity then the absolute minimum energy usage is achieved. When this is achieved, the exhaust stops in space and has no kinetic energy; and the propulsive efficiency is 100% all the energy ends up in the vehicle (in principle such a drive would be 100% efficient, in practice there would be thermal losses from within the drive system and residual heat in the exhaust). However, in most cases this uses an impractical quantity of propellant, but is a useful theoretical consideration. Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless plasma thruster) actually can significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This can help reduce propellant usage and improve acceleration at different stages of the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15 km/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4 km/s). For a mission, for example, when launching from or landing on a planet, the effects of gravitational attraction and any atmospheric drag must be overcome by using fuel. It is typical to combine the effects of these and other effects into an effective mission delta-v. For example, a launch mission to low Earth orbit requires about 9.3–10 km/s delta-v. These mission delta-vs are typically numerically integrated on a computer. =Cycle efficiency= All reaction engines lose some energy, mostly as heat. Different reaction engines have different efficiencies and losses. For example, rocket engines can be up to 60–70% energy efficient in terms of accelerating the propellant. The rest is lost as heat and thermal radiation, primarily in the exhaust. =Oberth effect= Reaction engines are more energy efficient when they emit their reaction mass when the vehicle is travelling at high speed. This is because the useful mechanical energy generated is simply force times distance, and when a thrust force is generated while the vehicle moves, then: :E = F \\\\times d \\\\; where F is the force and d is the distance moved. Dividing by length of time of motion we get: : \\\\frac E t = P = \\\\frac {F \\\\times d} t = F \\\\times v Hence: : P = F \\\\times v \\\\; where P is the useful power and v is the speed. Hence, v should be as high as possible, and a stationary engine does no useful work.Note, that might seem to suggest that a stationary engine would not start to move. However, at low speeds the amount of energy needed to start to move tends to zero faster than the power does. So in practice it does move, as you would expect.

This is a useful data transformation technique used to stabilize variance, make the data more normal distribution-like, improve the validity of measures of association such as the Pearson correlation between variables and for other data stabilization procedures. Power transforms are ubiquitously used in various fields. For example, multi-resolution and wavelet analysis, statistical data analysis, medical research, modeling of physical processes, geochemical data analysis, epidemiology and many other clinical, environmental and social research areas. Definition The power transformation is defined as a continuously varying function, with respect to the power parameter λ, in a piece-wise function form that makes it continuous at the point of singularity (λ = 0). For data vectors (y1,..., yn) in which each yi > 0, the power transform is : y_i^{(\\\\lambda)} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{y_i^\\\\lambda-1}{\\\\lambda(\\\\operatorname{GM}(y))^{\\\\lambda -1}} , &\\\\text{if } \\\\lambda eq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[12pt] \\\\operatorname{GM}(y)\\\\ln{y_i} , &\\\\text{if } \\\\lambda = 0 \\\\end{cases} where : \\\\operatorname{GM}(y) = \\\\left(\\\\prod_{i=1}^n y_i\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{n} = \\\\sqrt[n]{y_1 y_2 \\\\cdots y_n} \\\\, is the geometric mean of the observations y1, ..., yn. The case for \\\\lambda = 0 is the limit as \\\\lambda approaches 0. To see this, note that y_i^{\\\\lambda} = \\\\operatorname{exp}({\\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{log}(y_i)}) = 1 + \\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{log}(y_i) + O((\\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{log}(y_i))^2). Then \\\\dfrac{y_i^\\\\lambda-1}\\\\lambda = \\\\operatorname{log}(y_i) + O(\\\\lambda), and everything but \\\\operatorname{log}(y_i) becomes negligible for \\\\lambda sufficiently small. The inclusion of the (λ − 1)th power of the geometric mean in the denominator simplifies the scientific interpretation of any equation involving y_i^{(\\\\lambda)}, because the units of measurement do not change as λ changes. Box and Cox (1964) introduced the geometric mean into this transformation by first including the Jacobian of rescaled power transformation : \\\\dfrac{y^\\\\lambda-1}{\\\\lambda} . with the likelihood. This Jacobian is as follows: : J(\\\\lambda; y_1, ..., y_n) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n d y_i^{(\\\\lambda)} / dy = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n y_i^{\\\\lambda-1} = \\\\operatorname{GM}(y)^{n(\\\\lambda-1)} This allows the normal log likelihood at its maximum to be written as follows: : \\\\log ( \\\\mathcal{L} (\\\\hat\\\\mu,\\\\hat\\\\sigma)) = (-n/2)(\\\\log(2\\\\pi\\\\hat\\\\sigma^2) +1) + n(\\\\lambda-1) \\\\log(\\\\operatorname{GM}(y)) :: = (-n/2)(\\\\log(2\\\\pi\\\\hat\\\\sigma^2 / \\\\operatorname{GM}(y)^{2(\\\\lambda-1)}) + 1). From here, absorbing \\\\operatorname{GM}(y)^{2(\\\\lambda-1)} into the expression for \\\\hat\\\\sigma^2 produces an expression that establishes that minimizing the sum of squares of residuals from y_i^{(\\\\lambda)}is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the normal log likelihood of deviations from (y^\\\\lambda-1)/\\\\lambda and the log of the Jacobian of the transformation. The value at Y = 1 for any λ is 0, and the derivative with respect to Y there is 1 for any λ. Sometimes Y is a version of some other variable scaled to give Y = 1 at some sort of average value. The transformation is a power transformation, but done in such a way as to make it continuous with the parameter λ at λ = 0. It has proved popular in regression analysis, including econometrics. Box and Cox also proposed a more general form of the transformation that incorporates a shift parameter. :\\\\tau(y_i;\\\\lambda, \\\\alpha) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{(y_i + \\\\alpha)^\\\\lambda - 1}{\\\\lambda (\\\\operatorname{GM}(y+\\\\alpha))^{\\\\lambda - 1}} & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda eq 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{GM}(y+\\\\alpha)\\\\ln(y_i + \\\\alpha)& \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda=0,\\\\end{cases} which holds if yi + α > 0 for all i. If τ(Y, λ, α) follows a truncated normal distribution, then Y is said to follow a Box–Cox distribution. Bickel and Doksum eliminated the need to use a truncated distribution by extending the range of the transformation to all y, as follows: :\\\\tau(y_i;\\\\lambda, \\\\alpha) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{\\\\operatorname{sgn}(y_i + \\\\alpha)y_i + \\\\alpha^\\\\lambda - 1}{\\\\lambda (\\\\operatorname{GM}(y+\\\\alpha))^{\\\\lambda - 1}} & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda eq 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{GM}(y+\\\\alpha)\\\\operatorname{sgn}(y+\\\\alpha)\\\\ln(y_i + \\\\alpha)& \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda=0,\\\\end{cases}, where sgn(.) is the sign function. This change in definition has little practical import as long as \\\\alpha is less than \\\\operatorname{min}(y_i), which it usually is. Bickel and Doksum also proved that the parameter estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal under appropriate regularity conditions, though the standard Cramér–Rao lower bound can substantially underestimate the variance when parameter values are small relative to the noise variance. However, this problem of underestimating the variance may not be a substantive problem in many applications. Box–Cox transformation The one-parameter Box–Cox transformations are defined as : y_i^{(\\\\lambda)} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{y_i^\\\\lambda - 1}{\\\\lambda} & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda eq 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln y_i & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda = 0, \\\\end{cases} and the two-parameter Box–Cox transformations as : y_i^{(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda})} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{(y_i + \\\\lambda_2)^{\\\\lambda_1} - 1}{\\\\lambda_1} & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda_1 eq 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln (y_i + \\\\lambda_2) & \\\\text{if } \\\\lambda_1 = 0, \\\\end{cases} as described in the original article. Moreover, the first transformations hold for y_i > 0, and the second for y_i > -\\\\lambda_2. The parameter \\\\lambda is estimated using the profile likelihood function. =Confidence interval= Confidence interval for the Box–Cox transformation can be asymptotically constructed using Wilks's theorem on the profile likelihood function to find all the possible values of \\\\lambda that fulfill the following restriction: :\\\\ln \\\\big(L(\\\\lambda)\\\\big) \\\\ge \\\\ln \\\\big(L(\\\\hat\\\\lambda)\\\\big) - \\\\frac{1}{2} {\\\\chi^2}_{1,1 - \\\\alpha}. =Example= The BUPA liver data setBUPA liver disorder dataset contains data on liver enzymes ALT and γGT. Suppose we are interested in using log(γGT) to predict ALT. A plot of the data appears in panel (a) of the figure. There appears to be non-constant variance, and a Box–Cox transformation might help. image:BUPA BoxCox.JPG The log-likelihood of the power parameter appears in panel (b). The horizontal reference line is at a distance of χ12/2 from the maximum and can be used to read off an approximate 95% confidence interval for λ. It appears as though a value close to zero would be good, so we take logs. Possibly, the transformation could be improved by adding a shift parameter to the log transformation. Panel (c) of the figure shows the log-likelihood. In this case, the maximum of the likelihood is close to zero suggesting that a shift parameter is not needed. The final panel shows the transformed data with a superimposed regression line. Note that although Box–Cox transformations can make big improvements in model fit, there are some issues that the transformation cannot help with. In the current example, the data are rather heavy-tailed so that the assumption of normality is not realistic and a robust regression approach leads to a more precise model. =Econometric application= Economists often characterize production relationships by some variant of the Box–Cox transformation. Consider a common representation of production Q as dependent on services provided by a capital stock K and by labor hours N: :\\\\tau(Q)=\\\\alpha \\\\tau(K)+ (1-\\\\alpha)\\\\tau(N).\\\\, Solving for Q by inverting the Box–Cox transformation we find :Q=\\\\big(\\\\alpha K^\\\\lambda + (1-\\\\alpha) N^\\\\lambda\\\\big)^{1/\\\\lambda},\\\\, which is known as the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. The CES production function is a homogeneous function of degree one. When λ = 1, this produces the linear production function: : Q=\\\\alpha K + (1-\\\\alpha)N.\\\\, When λ → 0 this produces the famous Cobb–Douglas production function: : Q=K^\\\\alpha N^{1-\\\\alpha}.\\\\, =Activities and demonstrations= The SOCR resource pages contain a number of hands-on interactive activitiesPower Transform Family Graphs, SOCR webpages demonstrating the Box–Cox (power) transformation using Java applets and charts. These directly illustrate the effects of this transform on Q-Q plots, X-Y scatterplots, time-series plots and histograms. Yeo–Johnson transformation The Yeo–Johnson transformation allows also for zero and negative values of y. \\\\lambda can be any real number, where \\\\lambda = 1 produces the identity transformation.

One of the men, Nico (Jeffrey Hunter), is a seasoned, decorated sergeant; the second, Frankie (Robert Wagner), is a perennial goof-off, who drinks too much; and the third, Alan (Bradford Dillman), is an intellectual from a wealthy family. He has joined the Marines, despite his father's protests. Nico, Frankie and Alan come to San Francisco on a furlough from the war. Nico proposes and marries his pregnant girlfriend Andrea (Hope Lange). A drunken Frankie fights with Charlie Stanton, his hateful stepfather, who thinks him a coward. The wealthy Alan catches his fiancée, Sue (Dana Wynter), with another man. Lorraine (Sheree North), who is in love with Frankie, has joined the military as a WAVE. She introduces his friend Alan to her roommate Kalai (France Nuyen), a nurse of Hawaiian-French heritage. They all go to Lorraine's apartment, where Frankie first passes out, then wakes up screaming at the thought of returning to the war. Lorraine decides to leave him. Kalai professes her love for Alan. The three men return to the Pacific front. Frankie initially shows cowardice and Nico slaps some sense into him. Later, Frankie saves Alan and is honored for his heroism. Alan becomes ill with malaria and when a wounded Japanese soldier calls out to him for help, he tries to give the Japanese soldier some water but Nico shoots the wounded soldier and reveals to Alan and the other marines that a grenade was hidden under the wounded soldier as a trap. Alan then begins to question the futility of the war. When an advancing enemy tank threatens the platoon, Nico singlehandedly blows up the tank, but dies from his wounds. Back home, Kalai visits Sue in the hospital after she tries to commit suicide. Suffering from alcohol withdrawal, Sue dies during Kali's visit. The war ends and Alan returns to Kalai and becomes a professor at the local university. Frankie, now promoted to sergeant, brings Nico's last love letter home to Andrea, who has given birth to their child. Andrea tells Frankie that she would like to see him again.

The recently restored interior of the building represents various historic epochs and styles. History Bogdan Khanenko was a famous patron of arts, and during his forty-year collection activity he purchased works from art auctions in Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and Madrid. His most valuable purchases resulted from his trips to Italy where he obtained approximately 100 pieces through Rome and Florence auctions.

The school houses grades 9-12. 2010 building The city of Enterprise approved the rebuilding of Enterprise High School at a new location on the northwestern side of town off of Boll Weevil Circle, the city's main bypass. The school was constructed with more than $45 million in FEMA, insurance settlements, and state approved grant money. The town also approved a sales tax increase to collect funds for school construction. Overall, The result was construction of an $86 million replacement school. The new Enterprise High, at 525,000 square feet, is one of the largest schools in the Southeast. On August 23, 2010, the doors of the new Enterprise High School opened to students. It was the first time in more than three years that High School students in Enterprise had been able to attend school in a High School building. Since March 2007, they had been sharing the campus of Enterprise State Community College with the local college students. The start of school year for all schools in the City of Enterprise had been delayed for two weeks to ensure that the High School building (the only public High School in town) would be ready for the first day of school. The streets surrounding the campus were named just prior to the first day of school. Woodham Drive was named after John W. Woodham, an architect who worked with the school system for 25 years. Ralls drive was named after John G. Ralls, who sold more than of land to the school system for the construction of the new school, and then donated a portion of the sale price back to the school. A third road was named after Webe Curenton, who sold his property to the school so that a driveway could be built connecting the school with Main Street. Wild Cat Way, the road surrounding the perimeter of the school, was named after the school's \\"Wildcat\\" mascot. March 2007 tornado President Bush talks with the media after walking through the tornado damage at Enterprise High School. On March 1, 2007, Enterprise High School was hit by an EF4 tornado during the February–March 2007 Tornado Outbreak. The twister collapsed parts of the building's science wing, third hallway and new gym, while causing severe damage in other areas of the school after impacting near Enterprise's municipal airport. The parking lot designated \\"Blue\\" was severely damaged, with cars stacked on each other. Cars in the other school parking lots were also damaged. Early news reports indicated that 20% of the building was damaged, and numerous students were injured. reported eight fatalities at the school as of 8:30 p.m. CST on the evening of the storm; earlier reports had set the death toll as high as 22, later scaled back to five. The death toll was increased again the following day to eight as recovery efforts went onward. The final death toll was set at nine, including Ryan Mohler, Peter Dunn, AJ Jackson, Jamie Vidensek, Michael Bowen, Mikey Tompkins, Katie Strunk, Michelle Wilson, and an elderly woman named Edna Strickland. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since 1990. After the tornado, the school was relocated to Enterprise-Ozark Community College (later renamed Enterprise State Community College), where it remained until the new school building was completed in August 2010. The song \\"Held In His Love\\" by The Springs was written by Stewart Halcomb, a student inside Enterprise High School (Alabama) on March 1, 2007 and dedicated to the eight friends he lost that day.

Desegregation Enterprise High School was affected historically by desegregation efforts within Alabama. Six families in Enterprise integrated the public schools in the 1966 school year. Children were given \\"Freedom of Choice forms\\" to bring home for their parents to complete the year before. These six families chose the white schools. The first year was peaceful without incident. A few years later the all black elementary school was closed and the all black high school was changed to 7th grade only. By the Fall of 1970, the school's total enrollment of 1,131 numbered 182 African-American and 949 other students. At the same time, the school had eight African-American teachers and 45 other teachers on its 53-member faculty.United States Department of Health Education and Welfare (HEW) Office for Civil Rights, Directory of Public Secondary and Elementary Schools in Selected Districts: Fall 1970, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1972, p. 10.

Open E tuning is a tuning for guitar: low to high, E-B-E-G-B-E. Compared to standard tuning, two strings are two semitones higher and one string is one semitone higher. The intervals are identical to those found in open D tuning. In fact, it is common for players to keep their guitar tuned to open d and place a capo over the second fret. This use of a capo allows for quickly changing between open d and open e without having to manipulate the guitar's tuning pegs.http://opendtuning.com/open-e-tuning/ Familiar examples of Open E tuning include the distinctive song \\"Bo Diddley\\" by Bo Diddley, the beginning guitar part on the song \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" the rhythm guitar on \\"Gimme Shelter\\" by The Rolling Stones, as well as their distinctly earthy blues song \\"Prodigal Son\\" from the Beggars Banquet album, originally by Robert Wilkins. The whole of Bob Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" album was recorded in open E tuning, although some of the songs have been re-recorded in standard tuning prior to the album's release. The tuning is also used in The Black Crowes' \\"She Talks to Angels\\", Glen Hansard's \\"Say It To Me Now\\", Joe Walsh's \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", Rush's \\"Headlong Flight\\", Dave Mason's \\"We Just Disagree\\", The Faces' \\"Stay With Me\\", Billy F.

Open E tuning also lends itself to easy barre-chording as heard in some of these songs. Chris Martin of Coldplay also uses this tuning live in the song Hurts Like Heaven, but puts a capo on sixth fret. Open E tuning is often used for slide guitar, as it constitutes an open chord, which can be raised by moving the slide further up the neck. Most notably Duane Allman used Open E for the majority of his slide work, such as in \\"Statesboro Blues\\". 1980s session guitarist David Persons experimented by using multiple tunings in the same recordings, and he pioneered several revolutionary tuning techniques, including using standard six string and open tuning together (for instance, standard tuning playing in E major and Open E tuning), which produced, due to the natural intervals involved, complementary counterpoints, which produced unique harmonies and dissonance. This can be heard on several of his early recordings.Christian Musician Interview article with Persons, January 1986.

For his contributions to music, he was decorated with the Légion d'honneur in 1884.Culture.gouv.fr Life and career Born in Lille, Franchomme studied at the local conservatoire with M. Mas and Pierre Baumann, before continuing his education with Jean-Henri Levasseur and Louis-Pierre Norblin at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he won his first prize only after one year. He began his career playing with various orchestras and was appointed solo cello at the Sainte-Chapelle in 1828. Along with the violinist Jean-Delphin Alard, teacher of Pablo de Sarasate, and the pianist Charles Hallé, creator of the Hallé Orchestra, he was a founder and member of the Alard Quartet. The Quartet was rare for a chamber ensemble of its time because it consisted of professional musicians. Franchomme also belonged to the founding ranks of the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire. Franchomme forged close friendships with Felix Mendelssohn, when the latter visited Paris in 1831, and with Frédéric Chopin. In 1833, Chopin and Franchomme collaborated to write a Grand Duo concertant for piano and cello, based on themes from Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable. Franchomme also rewrote the cello parts for Chopin's Polonaise Brillante, Op. 3, and was the dedicatee of Chopin's Cello Sonata, Op. 65. Franchomme was also the dedicatee of the cello sonata of Charles-Valentin Alkan. With the exception of a trip to England in 1856, Franchomme hardly left Paris, where he became a central figure of the city's musical life. In 1843, he acquired the Duport Stradivarius from the son of Jean-Louis Duport for the then-record sum of 22,000 French francs. He also owned the De Munck Stradivarius of 1730. Franchomme succeeded Norblin as the head professor of cello at the Paris Conservatory in 1846, and his class included Jules Delsart (who succeeded his master), Louis Hegyesi, and Ernest Gillet. He died in his sleep of a massive heart attack on 21 January 1884 at the age of 75, just four days after he was decorated with the Légion d'honneur. Legacy Franchomme was the most celebrated cellist of his time and contributed to the refinement of the bowing technique—elegant, sweet, and light—which distinguished the French school developed by Jean-Pierre and Jean- Louis Duport. His left hand was renowned for its deft, precise, and expressive powers of execution. On 3 May 1856, the Weekly Chronicle and Register noted that he \\"carefully abstains from all abuse of the tremolo and of the exaggerated expression which are the distinguishing features in most modern violoncello playing\\". As a composer, Franchomme published some fifty-five works for cello, including the Twelve Caprices, Op. 7, and the Twelve Études, with optional second cello, Op. 35; one cello concerto, Op. 33; as well as numerous other pieces with piano, orchestral, or chamber accompaniment.

It is produced by Bike New York. Conducted on the first Sunday of May, the ride includes over 30,000 riders. The route takes riders through all five of New York's boroughs and across five major bridges. The entire route, including bridges and expressways which normally prohibit cyclists, is closed to automobile traffic for the ride.  History  The event began on June 12, 1977 as the Five Boro Challenge with about 250 participants on an 80-mile course. The goal of the first tour was to provide training in bicycle safety for high school students. Then New York City Mayor Ed Koch promoted the idea of a citywide bike tour and the distance was shortened. From 1979 to 1990, Citibank was the primary sponsor of the event. Citibank withdrew as sponsor in 1991. Unable to find a replacement sponsor in time, the event was not held that year. It returned in 1992 when TD Bank bought naming rights to the tour. In 2013 the City proposed to charge the Tour nearly a million dollars for police services, claiming Bike New York does not qualify as a charity; after Bike New York filed a lawsuit, Judge Margaret Chan ruled that NYPD does not have the right to make that determination. The Tour had been managed by the New York Council of American Youth Hostels (AYH), for many years by tour director Paul Sullivan,http://www.transalt.org/files/news/magazine/995OctNov/21sullivan.html who died in 1999. That same year, AYH spun off the event into a new nonprofit called Bike New York.  Route  The route begins in Lower Manhattan, heads north via Sixth Avenue through the interior of Central Park and continues into Harlem and the Bronx via the Madison Avenue Bridge. Re-entering Manhattan, it travels south along the East River on the FDR Drive. The route crosses the Queensboro Bridge into Queens before heading south across the Pulaski Bridge into Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into Staten Island. Many people rent bikes in order to participate in the ride. There are several local bike shops that rent bikes in NYC. Unlimited Biking is the official bike rental partner for Bike New York, the event producer.

He has taught courses on painting at the Academy of Art of Rome and Catania and Perception and Visual Communication at Suor Orsola Benincasa of Naples, the Italian Institute for Philosophical Studies. Both his life and his art have been greatly influenced by his intellectual exchanges with Hermann Nitsch, Peter Kubelka, Antonio Gargano, Buz Barclay, Jonas Mekas and Bernard Heidsieck. Likewise, his decade of work in the Historical Archives of the Institute of the Banco of Naples Foundation yielded numerous works, the most important of which is his volume prefaced by Ernst H. Gombrich, The Pleasures of Boredom: Four Centuries of Doodles in the Historical Archives of the Bank of Naples.The preface was later reprinted in Gombrich's The uses of images: studies in the social function of art and visual communication In 1998 the antique yacht Halloween became his home, laboratory and oratorio, inspiring his poem Prisoner of Freedom, which was translated into Japanese by Moto Hashiramoto. The book was presented at the Twelfth Congress of the Society for the Philosophy of Language (Piano di Sorrento, October 2005) as the first symmetrical book in the tradition of the illustrated poem. In 2003 Zevola created an installation in the Certosa of Padula entitled The Rule and the Exception: The All Too Human Cry of Giordano Bruno Responds to the Contemplative Silence of San Bruno, which is still on view. In 2004 he founded the publishing house Position Plotting Book which publishes in editions of 500 without a copyright the works of various international authors with translations in numerous languages. Recitations of these works have been the occasion for several performances around the world (Kyoto, Tokyo, Vilnius, Vienna, Berlin, Budapest, Paris, Naples, Rome and New York City). In 2005 Zevola was the chief assistant to Hermann Nitsch in his 122nd Aktion al Burgtheater of Vienna, thus celebrating their more than thirty-year intellectual and artistic friendship. The Sacred Forest of Bomarzo, an ancient place of inspiration, has now taken the place of Zevola’s yacht Halloween. There, he has launched new projects such as Art Real Estate: Center for the Free Circulation of People and Ideas Across the Planet. Among his most recent installations and exhibitions are Naples Calls New York: Mystic Teresa (Anthology Film Archives, November 2005, New York), Naples Calls Kyoto: 33 Photocollages for a Book (University of Art and Design, Kyoto, October 2005), Works and Days: The Rule (Certosa di San Lorenzo, Padula, June 2003), and currently Prince Antonio de Curtis Calls Daedalus: First Experiment of the Cosmographic Imagination (Kaplan’s Project, Palazzo Spinelli, Naples).

He engaged in a series of controversial court cases against Thaksin, who by that time had become Prime Minister of Thailand, during the height of the 2005–06 Thai political crisis.

In 2002, a court threw out the breach of contract charges after finding that the contract between Monson and Thaksin had never taken effect. The court ruled that the contract between Monson and CTVC of Hawaii (USA), on one side, and Thaksin, his wife, and Shinawatra Computer, on the other side, to set up Video Link Co Ltd was void from the beginning; Monson's resignation from Video Link's board of directors voided the contract.

Her mother, Hortense Kalisher Kleinberg, was a commercial artist and a fierce proponent of women's rights who imbued her daughter with a sense of independence. Her father, Lester Kleinberg, was a successful commodities broker in hay and grain. Baer studied art as a child at the Cornish College of the Arts, but because her mother wanted her to become a medical illustrator, she majored in biology at the University of Washington in Seattle, which she attended from 1946-1949. She dropped out of school in her junior year to marry a fellow-student at the University, Gerard L. Hanauer. The marriage was over quickly, and in 1950, Baer went to Israel to explore the realities of rural socialism on various kibbutzim for a few months. Returning to New York City, from 1950–53 she did the course work for a master's degree in psychology at The New School for Social Research.Judith Stein, \\"The Adventures of Jo Baer,\\" Art in America, May 2003, 104-111, 157; reprinted in 'Broadsides & Belles Lettres: Selected Writings and Interviews 1965–2010, pp. 13–26. Baer went to school at night, while during the day she was employed by an interior design studio as a draftsperson and secretary. Baer moved to Los Angeles in 1953 and shortly afterwards married Richard Baer, a television writer. Their son, Joshua Baer, who became an art dealer, writer, and consultant, was born in 1955; the couple was divorced in the late 1950s. During this time Baer began to paint and draw for the first time since adolescence, becoming friends with Edward Kienholz and other local artists in the orbit of the Ferus Gallery. She met the painter John Wesley, to whom she was married from 1960-1970. She, Wesley, and Joshua moved to New York in 1960, where Baer lived until 1975. After separating from Wesley, she was in a long-term relationship with the sculptor Robert Lawrance Lobe.\\"Biography,\\" in 'Broadsides & Belles Lettres: Selected Writings and Interviews 1965–2010, p. 9.

Rothko, she observed, \\"gave me permission to work with a format.\\" Jasper Johns's paintings and sculpture also made an immediate impression, because they suggested \\"how a work should be the thing itself.\\"Jo Baer, oral history interview with Avis Berman, 2010 Oct. 5-7, Smithsonian Archives of American Art.  Life and career, 1960-1975  =Paintings and exhibitions= Right: Korean (1963). Left: Korean (1962). In 1960 Baer rejected Abstract Expressionism for spare, hard-edge non-objective painting.Online bio retrieved October 3, 2009 Two early important paintings in this style were Untitled (Black Star) (1960-1961; Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo) and Untitled (White Star) (1960-1961; Kröller- Müller Museum, Otterlo). She then introduced an even more pared-down format: the image was excised and the central area of the canvas became completely white. In 1962 Baer began the Korean series, a group of sixteen canvases. The Koreans were given their name by the art dealer Richard Bellamy, who said that Baer's paintings were just as unknown as Korean art was to most Westerners. The Koreans were composed of a dominant field of densely painted white enclosed by bands of sky blue and black that seem to shimmer and move: this optical illusion underscored Baer's focus on \\"the notion of light.\\" Baer ascribed her inspiration for the Koreans to Samuel Beckett's novel The Unnamable, which she was reading at the time. His observations about osmosis and diffusion through membranes influenced her to examine the properties of boundaries between spaces. In many works that Baer created between 1964 and 1966, the peripheries and edges of the canvas continued to be marked by two square or rectangular bands of color. The outer, thicker border was black; inside it, a thinner band was painted in another color, such as red, green, lavender, or blue. Baer summed up the artistic concerns of her own work in 1971, writing, \\"Non-objective painting's language is rooted, nowadays, in edges and boundaries, contours and gradients, brightness, darkness and color reflections. Its syntax is motion and change.\\"Jo Baer, \\"On Painting,\\" Flash Art 37 (November 1972), pp. 6–7, reprinted in Broadsides & Belles Lettres, p. 70. Baer was accepted as a peer in the burgeoning Minimalist movement by such artists as Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, and Dan Flavin.\\"Jo Baer\\", Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Retrieved online 14 October 2018. In 1964 Flavin organized \\"Eleven Artists,\\" an exhibition that was an important step in defining the key figures of Minimalism. He included Baer, along with Judd, Flavin, LeWitt, Ward Jackson, Frank Stella, Irwin Fleminger, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Robert Ryman, Leo Valledor, and himself. In 1966 Baer's first one-person show took place at the Fischbach Gallery, then a center for avant-garde art. That year she was also represented in both \\"Systemic Painting,\\" a survey exhibition of contemporary geometric abstraction at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\\"Systemic Painting\\", Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, Retrieved online 14 October 2018. She also participated in \\"10,\\" a group exhibition at the Virginia Dwan Gallery co-curated by Ad Reinhardt and Robert Smithson that further enshrined its participants as canonical for Minimalism. Besides Baer, Reinhardt, and Smithson, the other artists selected were Carl Andre, Judd, LeWitt, Flavin, Robert Morris, Michael Steiner, and Agnes Martin.Lucy R. Lippard, \\"Out of the Past: Lucy R. Lippard talks about Eva Hesse with Nancy Holt and Robert Smithson,\\" Artforum, February 2008, findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_6_46/ai_n31297522/?tag=content;col1 Accessed July 10, 2012; \\"Jo Baer interviewed by Mark Godfrey,\\" 2004, reprinted in Broadsides & Belles Lettres, p. 26. Baer's works shown in these exhibitions, which included vertical and horizontal single, diptych, and triptych paintings, established her avant-garde reputation in the New York art world. The Old Year (1974-1975) In the late 1960s, Baer was experimenting with color and shifting the visual focus of her work. While working on the series The Stations of the Spectrum (1967-1969), Baer painted over their white surfaces to make them gray. She then turned them into triptychs because she saw that these paintings had more wall power when they were hung together. Next, as she said, \\"I wanted to know what happens around a corner – that interested me as an optical thing.\\" The result was the Wraparound paintings, where-in which Baer painted thick black bands edged by blues, greens, oranges, and lavenders that went around the sides of the canvas – areas that artists customarily ignore, overlook, or cover with a frame. More than ever, the action was at the edges: \\"Sensation,\\" Baer wrote, \\"is the edge of things. Where there are no edges, there are no places—a uniform visual field quickly disappears.\\"Jo Baer, \\"On Seeing,\\" unpublished text, late 1960s-1970s, printed in Broadsides & Belles Lettres, p. 51. Further challenging the notion of where a painting begins or ends, Baer added sweeping diagonal and curved paths of color that streaked across her once-inviolate white fields and down the sides of the canvas. These canvases bore titles like H. Arcuata (1971; coll. Daimler Corporation, Zurich) and V. Lurida (1971, Levi-Strauss Collection, San Francisco). The titles were orotund flights of fancy – they identified fictitious specious of plants that she extrapolated from a book of botanical Latin she owned.

In letters to editors, articles, and statements in art magazines, she defended the integrity and continuing importance of painting from attacks on it by Minimalist sculptors, who insisted that it had become an irrelevant art form that should be renounced in favor of the production of three-dimensional objects.See, for example, \\"Letter to the editor,\\" Artforum, 6 (September 1967), pp. 5–6, reprinted in Broadsides & Belles Lettres, pp. 42–44. Because she publicly questioned the tenets of a powerful pantheon of artists that included Judd and Morris, Baer was ostracized by a number of her former colleagues. Oil on Canvas.(1963) Among Baer's most ambitious essays, for she which was able to employ her scientific training, was \\"Art & Vision: Mach Bands,\\" published in 1970.Jo Baer, \\"Art & Vision: Mach Bands,\\" Aspen Magazine, 8 (Fall-Winter 1970), section 9, reprinted in Broadsides & Belles Lettres, pp. 54–63. She tackled the physics and psychology of visual perception in her discussion of Mach bands, an optical illusion named after Ernest Mach, a nineteenth-century physicist who discovered that light-dark contrasts will intensify when opposing colors are placed next to each other: light areas will appear lighter and dark areas will seem darker. She linked this investigation into subjective sensations of the beholder to how edges, boundaries, and contours are experienced in modern art.  Life and career, 1975-present  In 1975 Baer was the subject of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, showcasing her Minimalist work. However, Baer reached an impasse with non-objective painting. Sensing that her format had become a formula, she could go no further with it. Two transitional canvases –- M. Refractarius (1974–75; private collection, Paris) and The Old Year (1974–75; private collection, United States) – record her desire to break away from Minimalism. Baer needed a distance from New York's art world, and in June 1975 she moved to Smarmore Castle, a manor and working farm with a Norman keep, in County Louth, Ireland.Smarmorecastle.com, Accessed July 26, 2012 In this new environment, the reality of horses, birds and other animals as well as the ways of country people informed her paintings. She began to paint quasi- figuratively, layering fragments of images of animal, human bodies and objects in muted, translucent colors. Baer also drew on erotic images found in early cave paintings, Paleolithic sculptures and fertility objects to create compositions that suggested palimpsests. Testament of the Powers That Be (Where Trees Turn to Sand, Residual Colours Stain the Lands) (2001) In 1977 Baer had a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and during the course of it she met the British artist Bruce Robbins. The two lived and worked together from 1978-1984, first in Ireland and then from 1982-1984 in London, creating paintings, drawings, and texts. Their collaborations were shown in eight two-person exhibitions.Jobaer.net Accessed July 10, 2012 While in London, Baer wrote one of her best-known articles, \\"I am no longer an abstract artist,\\" a manifesto published in Art in America in October 1983.Jo Baer, \\"I am no longer an abstract artist,\\" Art in America 71 (October 1983), pp. 136–137, reprinted in Broadsiders & Belles Lettres, pp. 111–112. Baer chronicled \\"abstraction's demise,\\" and in characterizing its meaninglessness in a vastly changed world, claimed openness, ambiguity, \\"metaphor, symbolism, and hierarchical relationships\\" as necessary building blocks of modern works. Baer announced that she and Robbins were working toward a \\"radical figuration\\" based on those constructs. Dusk (Bands and End- Points) (2012) was part of the exhibition \\"In the Land of the Giants\\" at Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam In 1984, Baer moved by herself to Amsterdam, where she has lived ever since.\\"Biography,\\" in Broadsides & Belles Lettres, p. 10. In the 1990s Baer's paintings became, in her words, \\"more declarative,\\" with richer colors, sharper light-dark contrasts, and more ambitious cultural and social criticism. Disparate images and symbols from American, European, Asian, and classical civilizations are fused with quotations from literature and densely layered allusions to the themes of war, sexuality, the destruction of the natural world, greed, injustice, repression, transience, and death. Two paintings in this style are Shrine of the Piggies (The Pigs Hog it All and Defacate and Piss on Where From They Get It and With Whom They Will Not Share.

She was a British Protestant Christian missionary in China, serving with the China Inland Mission. Early life and career The daughter of John Cable, a prosperous draper in Guildford, Cable early decided to become a missionary and studied pharmacy and human sciences at London University. She was engaged to a man who had also declared his intention to become a missionary, but he changed his mind and said he would not marry her unless she abandoned her ambition. She broke off the engagement, declined to take her final examination to graduate, and joined the China Inland Mission in 1901, meeting Evangeline (Eva) French who was returning to China following her first home leave. They worked together for the rest of their lives.\\"Women Missionaries.\\" Cable and French were stationed in Huozhou, Shanxi, and often traveled in the surrounding area. Eva's younger sister, Francesca, joined them in 1910 (although some sources say 1908), and they became known as the \\"trio.\\"Anderson, Gerald H. Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, , 1999. After 20 years in Huozhou, they believed that the mission should be turned over to Chinese leaders and the three applied to work in relatively unknown, largely Muslim western China. Although there were doubts that women should be assigned to this region, their proposal was accepted in 1923.Benson, Linda. \\"Missionaries with Attitude: A Women's Mission in Northwestern China.\\" International Bulletin of Missionary Research Vol. 29, No. 4, 2005, p. 183 The trio's base was Jiaquan, in the far western part of Gansu province Travels in Central Asia For most of the next 12 years, in the words of Mildred Cable: > \\"From Etzingol to Turpan, from Spring of Wine to Chuguchak, we ... spent > long years in following trade-routes, tracing faint caravan tracks, > searching out innumerable by-paths and exploring the most hidden oases. ... > Five times we traversed the whole length of the desert, and in the process > we had become part of its life.\\"Mildred Cable, The Gobi Desert, p. 276. A reviewer said of Cable and French's book, The Gobi Desert, that \\"this may be the best of many good books about Central Asia and the old Silk Road through the deserts of Western China.\\"accessed 14 Apr 2011 In June 1923, all three set out for Central Asia from Huozhou. Traveling 1,500 miles (2,414 km) over the next eight months, evangelizing as they went, they reached Zhangye (then referred to as Kanchow). Zhangye was the last city inside of the Great Wall. A Chinese evangelist was working there and, at his request, they set up a Bible school over the winter. When summer came they were on the road again, following the Hexi Corridor westward, this time with some of the Chinese believers they had trained. They rented houses and a building for a church in Jiuquan that thereafter would be their base. From Jiuquan they traveled extensively, selling and giving away Bibles and Christian literature and extending their range to Tibetan villages in Qinghai province, Mongol encampments, and Muslim towns in Xinjiang province. They studied the Uighur language to communicate with Muslim women, the top priority of their missionary efforts, although it appears that they made very few converts among the Muslims.Benson, pp. 185-186 Crescent Lake was one of the oases visited by Cable and the French sisters. The trio were independent, strong-willed, and bold women. Eva French was criticized for giving Communion to her Chinese congregation on Christmas Eve 1924, celebrating Communion being considered a male prerogative. Uncowed by the criticism, Mildred Cable celebrated Communion the following Easter. Their mode of travel in Central Asia differed from the contemporary expeditions of explorers such as Aurel Stein and Sven Hedin who often traveled in large caravans with armed guards. The three loaded their cart with religious literature and traversed the Silk Road alone or with a few Chinese colleagues.Benson, p. 185 The interpersonal relations among the \\"trio\\" were that \\"Mildred was the 'father figure,' Francesca the mother, and Eva the strong-willed, puckish and wonderful child.\\" Mildred was called \\"Napoleon\\" by some of her co-workers.Warner, Marina. \\"Introduction\\" to The Gobi Desert. Boston: Beacon Press, 1984, pp. xi, xix To return to England on home leave in 1926, they traveled via Russian Siberia. After their return in 1928, they took a year-long journey into Xinjiang (then known as Chinese Turkestan), on the way being detained by a Dongan leader, Ma Zhongying, to tend his wounds. In 1932, they made their first journey into the Gobi, where Cable was badly injured by a kick from a donkey. The trio left China for the last time in 1936 and were unable to return because, in August 1938, all foreigners were ordered to leave Gansu and Xinjiang by the local warlord. Cable and the French sisters retired to Dorset.Benson, 186 During her retirement, Cable was much in demand as a speaker, making several international tours. She and French continued writing. Mildred Cable served as a vice president for the British and Foreign Bible Society until her death in London in 1952.\\"Miss Mildred Cable.\\" Times [London, England] 2 May 1952: 8.

In this June 2016 photo, Matherly is shown speaking with a pair of youngsters while campaigning for the office at a street fair in downtown Fairbanks. The following provides a listing of the individuals who have served as mayor of Fairbanks, Alaska, as well as the ten mayors of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, a county equivalent which includes the city. Fairbanks, a home rule city in the U.S. state of Alaska, was founded in 1901. Fairbanks incorporated as a town on November 10, 1903, pursuant to the original laws allowing for communities in Alaska to incorporate. Following changes in those laws during the latter territorial era, Fairbanks began its current designation as a city ca. 1950. When statehood became effective for Alaska in 1959, the Alaska Constitution provided for home rule, a status the citizens of Fairbanks ratified the following year. The Fairbanks North Star Borough, which encompasses the city and several surrounding towns and villages, was established by an act of the Alaska State Legislature in 1963 (Chapter 52, Session Laws of Alaska 1963), and incorporated on January 1, 1964. The borough seat is in Fairbanks. Mayors of City of Fairbanks Steve Thompson (2010) H. A. Boucher (1973) Douglas Preston (1953) Maurice Johnson (1960) The city mayor was originally elected from amongst the council. This was later changed to the mayor being elected separately by voters for a two-year term, but serving as a figurehead, as the city was administered by a manager. The mayor began serving as the chief administrator of city government, serving a three-year term, in 1992. *2016–present: Jim Matherly *2013–2016: John Eberhart *2010–2013: Jerry Cleworth *2007–2010: Terry Strle *2001–2007: Steve M.

A community settlement, it had a population of in . It is administered by the Gush Etzion Regional Council. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, although the Israeli government disputes this. Netiv HaAvot outpost The Netiv HaAvot outpost, officially an expansion of Elazar, 500 meters beyond the Elzar settlement's jurisdiction,5 May '10: A license to loot: the Derekh Ha’avot outpost B'tselem, 25 April 2010. and adjacent to Alon Shvut is built on land which some human rights organizations consider privately owned Palestinian agricultural land, the former property of the Mussa family of al- Khader. Local Palestinian villagers say they owned and worked the land until military curfews and closures in the wake of the Al-Aqsa Intifada forced them to abandon it, whereupon settlers moved onto the land to build there in February 2001. An assistant to the Minister of Defence at that time, Brig. Gen. Baruch Spiegel, stated that the outpost was built on privately owned Palestinian land and on “survey land”, meaning land whose ownership was still subject to determination. Netiv HaAvot subsequently figured among 105 outposts listed in the Sasson Report submitted to the Israel cabinet in 2005, and the report noted that Israeli Ministry of Housing and Construction had by that date spent NIS 300,000 to develop the outpost. Netiv HaAvot has since been the subject of two High Court of Justice petitions. The court ordered the government to form a committee to examine the land ownership issue after 8 Palestinian farmers from al-Khader petitioned for the demolition of the outpost in 2002 on the basis that it was built on their privately owned land. No committee was constituted however. In 2008, a second petition to demolish the outpost was filed by Peace Now, and the state said a committee would be formed to examine land ownership. The office of the State Attorney responded by concurring that the outpost was unauthorized and that action, stop-work orders an demolitions, was being taken. In July 2009, justices ordered the state to provide a “clear timetable for carrying out the orders.” The timetable was never produced, On being told by Israeli Labor MP Yuli Tamir, who confronted the residents, that the outpost had been built without permits, the Gush Etzion Council head Shaul Goldstein replied:\\"I have examined 200 locales around Israel, and they were all erected this way. This is the building culture in Israel.\\" Tovah Lazaroff and Dan Izenberg Settlers lift Gush from consensus Jerusalem Post, 23 September 2009. The state, though having repeated for 9 years that the outpost had been built illegally, stated through the Attorney General on the 25 April 2010, in a notification to the High Court of Justice that the government was considering approving the settlement, subject to determining what buildings stood on state ground and which constructions were built on private Palestinian land. If cases were found reflecting the latter circumstance, then demolitions would proceed. B'tselem, the Israeli Human Rights organization argued that any such government approval would constitute approval of looting and unlawful construction, and implied that the state was ignoring obligations undertaking in the Road map for peace. The Peace Now petition was rejected in October 2010 by Justice Edmond Levy because the land survey had not been carried out. The survey, completed a month later, found that 60% of the outpost was built on privately owned Palestinian farmland. On April 13, 2014, Israel announced its intention to retroactively declare 983 dunams around Netiv HaAvot state land, marking the largest expropriation of West Bank territory in recent times. Palestinian village leaders were given notice of the state's intention to appropriate the land, and have 45 days to appeal the decision. According to Haaretz the \\"planned appropriation of land far exceeds the size of Netiv Ha’avot, which is built on just a few dozen dunams\\". About 50 families live in the outpost, including the secretary of Amana described by Haaretz as \\"the organization that is the driving force behind all the illegal outposts\\". Palestinians living in nearby villages were given 45 days to appeal the decision. Dror Etkes, head of the Peace Now settlement tracking project, described the decision as \\"a faithful reflection of the Netanyahu government’s policy\\" intended to \\"extinguish the last embers of the negotiations with the Palestinians\\". On June 12, 2018, the outpost was evicted due to a supreme court decision.

Along with his wife Varvara, Bogdan Khanenko is known for his philanthropic activities towards art and its preservation.  Biography  In 1871 Khanenko graduated from the law department of Moscow University and served as a judge in St Petersburg and Warsaw. By the end of 1880 he retired and settled in Kyiv, marrying Varvara Tereshchenko, daughter of sugar industrialist Nikolai Tereshchenko. Khanenko was a famous patron of the arts, and during his forty-year collection activity he purchased works from art auctions in Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and Madrid. His most valuable purchases resulted from his trips to Italy where he obtained approximately 100 pieces through auctions in Rome and Florence, and with the assistance of Alexander Rizzoni, a Russian-born painter living in Rome. He built a Museum of Western and Oriental Art with his unique and private foreign art collection. After his death, the museum opened up to the public and was named after the couple. In 1906 Bogdan Khanenko was elected to the State Council of Imperial Russia.

Plot details Act 1 At the opening of the show, Austin Bennett prepares for a date with his girlfriend Catherine, but discovers her cheating on him (\\"Another Saturday Night in New York\\"). He tells his brother Jeff, who suggests that the best way to win Catherine back is by pretending not to care. Jeff volunteers to find dates for them and plans a night on the town (\\"Oh What a Difference\\"). Meanwhile, Marcy Fitzwilliams is agonizing over her breakup with a man named Larry. Her friend Diana Bingley, an actuary, suggests some \\"dating rules\\" that will determine her ideal rebound time, telling Marcy that the best way to find Mr. Right is by finding Mr. Wrong (\\"The Actuary Song\\"). Austin and Jeff end up on a double-date with Marcy and Diana after setting one up on J-Date, despite none of them being Jewish. Diana is impressed with Jeff, but Marcy and Austin don't share a connection at all. Marcy reveals that she is a photographer, while Austin tells her that he writes greeting cards, but only as a way of supporting his passion for poetry. Austin is unable to explain this without frequently mentioning Catherine, to Marcy's annoyance (\\"But I Don't Want to Talk About Her\\"). Marcy decides Austin is \\"perfectly wrong\\" for her. Meanwhile, Jeff and Diana attempt to have sex, but Jeff throws his back out. Jeff's hospitalization gives Marcy a chance to try and continue seeing Austin. Over a conversation at the coffee shop, Marcy equates Austin's coffee preferences with his rigid lifestyle choices in general, and explains her own free-spirited nature (\\"Coffee\\"). Austin tries to call Catherine and win her back with an impromptu poem, which fails, and Marcy agrees to help him write a better one. As Jeff returns from the hospital and continues casually dating Diana, Marcy and Austin continue to work on a poem for Catherine, while fighting over details along the way. A bartender and cocktail waitress muse that their differences make them a perfect couple (\\"The Perfect Romance\\"). After Austin completes the poem, Marcy tells him to wait six months before sending it, but Jeff accidentally mails it out with the bills. Catherine's negative response ends up in Marcy's hands before Austin has seen it, and she takes him to a Chinese restaurant that offers free wine, in order to get him drunk enough to break the news to him. A series of humorous conflicts with the waiter at the restaurant result in Austin and Marcy skipping out on their bill and stealing a box of wine from the restaurant. Austin is impressed with himself for standing up for Marcy, and thanks her for his acting out of character (\\"Because of You\\"). When they are about to kiss, Marcy stops him and shows him the letter from Catherine. He grows angry, and they have a heated argument, but end up having sex. Meanwhile, Jeff and Diana articulate the nature of their \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship (\\"We're Just Friends\\"). The next day, Austin is ecstatic over his night with Marcy, and has fallen in love with her, though Marcy doesn't know how she feels about what happened. Jeff tells Austin to tell himself that he doesn't love her. Austin tries, but ends up thinking their relationship might have a future (\\"Maybe We Just Made Love\\"). Austin admits his feelings to Marcy, who rejects him, telling him she isn't ready for true love (\\"Just Not Now\\"). Ashamed, Austin goes home, and finds Catherine waiting for him. Act 2 On the streets of New York, Marcy meets the bartender and cocktail waitress from her first date with Austin, and tells them what happened. They elaborate on the joys of singlehood, and assure her she's better off. Marcy agrees at first, but changes her mind after seeing a happy couple on the street (\\"Alone\\"). Meanwhile, Diana is with Austin and Jeff in their apartment, where Austin has ordered Chinese food. The delivery man turns out to be the same waiter Austin skipped out on earlier. While Austin and the delivery man are settling the bill in another room, Diana tells Jeff she wants to be exclusive. Jeff responds with fear, spelling out the negative impact that would result if they were to be a real couple (\\"That's What's Gonna Happen\\"). After the delivery man leaves, Marcy shows up and tells Austin she loves him despite all his flaws, which she mentions in great detail (\\"Even Though\\"). Austin is offended by the \\"anyway\\" aspect of her love, and rejects her, telling her Catherine has taken him back. Diana, Jeff, Marcy, and Austin sing separately about the hurt they feel from not being with the ones they love (\\"But I Do\\"). Marcy and Diana go back to the bar where they had the first double date to drink and forget. The bartender and cocktail waitress remember them, and they all tell tales of lost love in the past, vowing to give up dating. Marcy and Diana have a change of heart, and the bartender and cocktail waitress imply that they were trying to make that happen all along (\\"What Do We Do it For?\\"). Diana tries to talk to Jeff, but is interrupted by Austin, who is fretting that Catherine doesn't know how he takes his coffee, despite having dated him for five years. Diana explains to Austin that everyone needs someone to love, and Marcy is his. Jeff also admits that he loves Diana (\\"Marcy's Yours\\"). Austin vows to rid himself of his uptight nature, knowing Marcy will accept him no matter what (\\"Goodbye\\"). In the final scene, Austin is trying to write a poem for Marcy, but she arrives before he can finish it. He improvises one, spelling out the ways she is different from him, but saying that rather than loving her \\"anyway\\" (as she had said earlier), he loves her \\"because\\" (\\"I Love You Because\\").

Vibration and impact shock during shipment and loading/unloading are controlled by cushioning to reduce the chance of product damage. Cushioning is usually inside a shipping container such as a corrugated box. It is designed to absorb shock by crushing and deforming, and to dampen vibration, rather than transmitting the shock and vibration to the protected item. Depending on the specific situation, package cushioning is often between 50 and 75 millimeters (two to three inches) thick. Internal packaging materials are also used for functions other than cushioning, such as to immobilize the products in the box and lock them in place, or to fill a void. Molded expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) cushioning Design factors Transit case showing internal shock mounting When designing packaging the choice of cushioning depends on many factors, including but not limited to: * effective protection of product from shock and vibration * resilience (whether it performs for multiple impacts) * resistance to creep – cushion deformation under static load * material costs * labor costs and productivity * effects of temperature, humidity, and air pressure on cushioning * cleanliness of cushioning (dust, insects, etc.) * effect on size of external shipping container * environmental and recycling issues * sensitivity of product to static electricity Common types of cushioning End caps and corner blocks Molded pulp cushioning Thermoformed end caps for a hard drive Coiled cable mount for heavy duty reusable containers Loose fill – Some cushion products are flowable and are packed loosely around the items in the box. The box is closed to tighten the pack. This includes expanded polystyrene foam pieces (Foam peanuts), similar pieces made of starch-based foams, and common popcorn. The amount of loose fill material required and the transmitted shock levels vary with the specific type of material. Paper – Paper can be manually or mechanically wadded up and used as a cushioning material. Heavier grades of paper provide more weight-bearing ability than old newspapers. Creped cellulose wadding is also available. (Movers often wrap objects with several layers of Kraft paper or embossed pulp before putting them into boxes.) Corrugated fiberboard pads – Multi-layer or cut-and-folded shapes of corrugated board can be used as cushions. These structures are designed to crush and deform under shock stress and provide some degree of cushioning. Paperboard composite honeycomb structures are also used for cushioning. Foam structures – Several types of polymeric foams are used for cushioning. The most common are: Expanded Polystyrene (also Styrofoam), polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyurethane. These can be molded engineered shapes or sheets which are cut and glued into cushion structures. Convoluted (or finger) foams sometimes used . Some degradable foams are also available. Foam-in-place is another method of using polyurethane foams. These fill the box, fully encapsulating the product to immobilize it. It is also used to form engineered structures. Molded pulp – Pulp can be molded into shapes suitable for cushioning and for immobilizing products in a package. Molded pulp is made from recycled newsprint and is recyclable. Inflated products – Bubble wrap consists of sheets of plastic film with enclosed “bubbles” of air. These sheets can be layered or wrapped around items to be shipped. A variety of engineered inflatable air cushions are also available. Note that inflated air pillows used for void-fill are not suited for cushioning. Other – Several other types of cushioning are available including suspension cushions, thermoformed end caps , and various types of shock mounts. Design for shock protection Drop test of cushioned package to measure the transmitted shock Proper performance of cushioning is dependent on its proper design and use. It is often best to use a trained packaging engineer, reputable vendor, consultant, or independent laboratory. An engineer needs to know the severity of shock (drop height, etc.) to protect against. This can be based on an existing specification, published industry standards and publications, field studies, etc. Knowledge of the product to be packaged is critical. Field experience may indicate the types of damage previously experienced. Laboratory analysis can help quantify the fragility of the item, often reported in g's. Engineering judgment can also be an excellent starting point. Sometimes a product can be made more rugged or can be supported to make it less susceptible to breakage. The amount of shock transmitted by a particular cushioning material is largely dependent on the thickness of the cushion, the drop height, and the load-bearing area of the cushion (static loading). A cushion must deform under shock for it to function. If a product is on a large load-bearing area, the cushion may not deform and will not cushion the shock. If the load-bearing area is too small, the product may “bottom out” during a shock; the shock is not cushioned. Engineers use “cushion curves” to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a cushioning material. Often two to three inches (50 – 75 mm) of cushioning are needed to protect fragile items. Computer simulations and finite element analysis are also being used. Some correlations to laboratory drop tests have been successful. Cushion design requires care to prevent shock amplification caused by the cushioned shock pulse duration being close to the natural frequency of the cushioned item. Design for vibration protection The process for vibration protection (or isolation) involves similar considerations as that for shock. Cushions can be thought of as performing like springs. Depending on cushion thickness and load-bearing area and on the forcing vibration frequency, the cushion may 1) not have any influence on input vibration, 2) amplify the input vibration at resonance, or 3) isolate the product from the vibration. Proper design is critical for cushion performance. Evaluation of finished package Verification and validation of prototype designs are required. The design of a package and its cushioning is often an iterative process involving several designs, evaluations, redesigns, etc. Several (ASTM, ISTA, and others) published package testing protocols are available to evaluate the performance of a proposed package. Field performance should be monitored for feedback into the design process.

He was licensed to preach in 1958; and ordained in 1966 by L. A. Hamblin. Bailey, a 1970 graduate of The College of the Bible at American Baptist College in Social Science. As an undergraduate, Bailey served as the 1969–1970 co-chairman of the student- faculty relations committee, chairman of the recruitment committee of the School of Religion and the National president of Alpha Theta Nu Omega theological fraternity. He completed his master's degree at Howard University School of Religion in Practical Theology in 1971. While attending Howard, he received the Maynard award for preaching. Upon his arrival to Hartford, Bailey served as state representative for the Connecticut Convention of American Baptist Churches USA, an auditor for the Connecticut Missionary Baptist Convention, chairman of the social action committee of the Ministerial Inter- denominational Alliance of Greater Hartford, and a general member of the board of directors of The North Hartford churches for the Aging, Bellevue Square Boys Club, The Hartford Chapter of 70001 Ltd. and the Family Service Society in Hartford, Connecticut. Bailey served as the State representative for the Connecticut Convention of American Baptist Churches on the American Baptist Churches USA 'Key 73' evangelistic committee. In 1972, Bailey galvanized the church to transition from a house church to purchase its first building, register with the National Baptist Convention and the American Baptist Convention, and launch a syndicated radio broadcast. In 1975, Bailey led efforts to secure the former Agudas Achim temple in Hartford, Connecticut. The building had suffered a 'great deal' of vandalism during a ten-year tenure as a property used for civic and social functions. Bailey raised 135,000 dollars (611,000.00 in 2015) to purchase the building from the previous owners. In 1976–1977, Bailey led a congregation effort to revitalize the building, repairing the structure of the building. The revitalization was cited by a contractor to cost 400,000 dollars (1,810,000.00 in 2015), the project was competed for only 60,000. ($271,000.00 in 2015). From 1986–1999, Bailey led the church in a series of capital campaigns to construct a housing complex, secure additional properties and construct The First Cathedral, in Bloomfield, Connecticut. In 2006, Bailey, established the American chapter of The International Bishops Conference. Under Bailey's leadership, the church's membership has grown tremendously. As of 2005, the membership numbered over 11,000 making the cathedral the largest church in the New England Region.(except from Archbishop Leroy Bailey) =Ministries= * 2002, Churches Covered and Connected in Covenant (C4) a forum for churches of diverse denominations, ethnicity and geographic locations. * 2004, Began a physical and spiritual health ministry.

The high schools in Windsor, South Windsor, Enfield, East Hartford, and the Metropolitan Learning Center, a magnet school, subsequently decided against using First Cathedral. = Same-sex marriage = In 2003, Bailey and other ministers paid for an advertisement in the Hartford Courant affirming their opposition to same-sex marriage. This was part of a larger statement he and other ministers made which included the claims that, if same-sex couples are provided the same marriage rights as opposite-sex couples, ministers would be forced against their will to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. Bailey is an adviser to the Family Institute of Connecticut. =Ministry affiliations= The First Cathedral is affiliated with several Ministries: * Churches United in Global Mission Churches United in Global Mission Website \\\\- A ministry of Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. * Connecticut Coalition of Churches * Pastors in Covenant * Churches Covered and Connected in CovenantChurches Covered and Connected in Covenant official website * The Capital Region Conference of ChurchesThe Capital Region Conference of Churches official website The First Cathedral: the edifice In 1998, the ministry at the time known as The First Baptist Church of Hartford broke ground on its first custom house of worship, on a plot in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Funding for the construction was raised via stewardship campaigns over twelve years. After two years of construction the first phase of the facility was completed. In the planning phases of the building, church officials planned to remain called The First Baptist Church of Hartford while occupying the edifice called The First Cathedral. The Ministry became known as The First Cathedral as individuals within the community who were unfamiliar with these plans began confusing the two. Built with the intention of being the final Building of The First Baptist Church, The First Cathedral is full of symbolism. The Cathedral Edifice is considered a radical departure from the Greek Revival and Georgian Architectural Styles used in the construction of most New England Churches. The First Cathedral is half of the complex of what is intended to be the final location of The First Baptist Church, The First Cathedral is full of symbolism. Church officials worked with architects and engineers to create an environment that is full of theological and biblical symbolism. =Overall structure= The First Cathedral edifice is built in the shape of a dove, a reference to the Baptism of Jesus which is recorded in every canonized Gospel. External symbolism The Foundation The Doves' Feet are represented by the foundation of the Cathedral. The foundation of the Cathedral, being quite large and being located on former swampland, is a network of grade beams that equally disburse the weight of the building. The structure The structure of The Cathedral is divided into 3 levels: • The First Level is the two commercial floors, the primary representing earth, the second representing Heaven • The Second Level is located within the second of the commercial floors, The Two Balconies representing Heaven. • The Third Level is Represented in the Cupola, 8 sided, ordained with stained glass windows, symbolic of the throne room of Heaven where God is Exterior walls The immediate external wall of the Cathedral are covers with Dryvit, the dryvit wall installed in stages reminiscent of the extensive project, undertaken by Nehemiah, in the rebuilding of the city walls of Israel. Additionally the Sandstone Color of the building is a reminder of the Wilderness Experience of the Ancient Israelites before reaching their promised land. Interior elements Within the Dove shaped edifice, are three major components, The Grand Lobby, The Grand Concourse and The Sanctuary, modeled after Solomon's Temple. The Grand Lobby The Grand Lobby is the 'facade' of The First Cathedral; the lobby contains several symbolic elements: •The entrance way is a set of double doors, creating an energy saving lock. The double set of double doors are reminiscent of the main entry way into an ancient city, the doors were part of the cities defense system. •Stained glass mosaic-depicts people of all races and every ethnicity from all directions with their hands lifted in praise. •Fountain - the fountain is in the shape of a tomb, the water shooting out of the fount comes in the form of cross representing life out of death.

He batted and threw right-handed. Career Cox was selected by the Red Sox with the seventeenth pick in the first round of the 1973 draft, ahead of Fred Lynn. Listed at 6' 3\\", 195 lb., Cox played five years in the Boston minor league system, stepping up a class every year, that was hastened by a phenomenal season in 1977 with Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. In 95 games, he hit .334 with 14 home runs and 81 RBI, which was highlighted by an All-Star selection, helping Pawtucket to clinch the regular season championship. After the season, he won both the Topps Minor League Player of the Year and the International League MVP awards, and was recalled by Boston in September 1977. Cox debuted with the Red Sox on September 18, on Thanks Brooks Robinson Day at Baltimore. Cox went 4 for 4 plus a walk in his first major league game, a 10–4 Boston victory over the Orioles. After the game, reporters told Cox he had tied the American League record for most hits in a first game. Casey Stengel, Willie McCovey and Mack Jones also share the mark. Boston returned to Fenway Park to face the New York Yankees the next day. In his first at-bat against the Yankees, Cox hit a single to tie a record set in 1933 by Cecil Travis of the Washington Senators, of five consecutive hits at the start of a major league career. Then, in his second at-bat Cox singled off Ed Figueroa, giving him a 6 for 6 hitting streak. Cox ended 1977 with a .362 average (21 for 58), and drew considerable attention to himself. Before the 1978 season he was traded by Boston along with Bo Díaz, Mike Paxton, and Rick Wise to the Cleveland Indians for Dennis Eckersley and Fred Kendall. After two years in Cleveland as a backup outfielder and playing all four infield positions, Cox joined the Seattle Mariners in 1980 and the Toronto Blue Jays in 1981, his last major league season. In a five-season career, Cox was a .245 hitter with 10 home runs and 79 RBI in 272 games. Later life After his playing career, Cox operated Grand Slam batting cages in Oklahoma City. In addition he was Oklahoma baseball director for the United States Specialty Sports Association. He was also an assistant baseball coach at Midwest City High School and Oklahoma City University. Cox worked with the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association to raise money for charities and civic causes. Death In November 2019, Cox was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He died in Midwest City, Oklahoma on March 11, 2020. Cox was survived by his wife Debbie (Pulliam) Cox, mother Ernestine, and sons Billy and Joey. Highlights *On April 9, 1980, Cox became the first player in American League history to collect a game-winning RBI, a statistic that was official only from 1980-88. *As of 2020, Cox holds the major league career record for most consecutive hits to begin a career (6).

It is issued at the discretion of the forecaster composing the watch or warning and implies that there is an enhanced risk of very severe and life- threatening weather, usually a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) a long-lived, extreme derecho event, but possibly another weather hazard such as an exceptional flash flood or fire. PDS watches are quite uncommon; less than 3% of watches issued by the SPC from 1996 to 2005 were PDS watches, or an average of 24 each year. When a PDS watch is issued, there are often more PDS watches issued for the same weather system, even on the same day during major outbreaks, so the number of days per year that a PDS watch is issued is significantly lower. Background The short history of the origin of the option of issuing a tornado watch with the enhanced PDS wording occurred during the winter of 1981–82 when the Severe Local Storms (SELS) unit transitioned to a more flexible method of issuing weather products. Ed Ferguson, Deputy Director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC), suggested to Lead Forecaster Jack Hales that the guidance center could provide an opportunity to give more resolution to the tornado watch product. Hales suggested the PDS option to identify areas where, a few times each year, conditions are most likely to aid in the development of large and intense tornadoes. The first PDS tornado watch was issued by Robert H. Johns for the April 2, 1982 tornado outbreak across the southern and central Great Plains. While historically applied only to severe thunderstorm, tornado and flash flood watches (i.e., severe local storm \\"polygonal\\" events), PDS wording could theoretically be applied to other types of weather watches (such as winter storm, high wind, hurricane, or fire weather watches) when an enhanced threat for such conditions exists. These watches have generally (but not always) been issued during a high risk or an upper-end moderate risk either of severe storms from the SPC's convective outlooks or of flash flooding from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC)'s excessive rainfall outlooks. On April 24, 2011, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Memphis, Tennessee, issued the first PDS flash flood watch to highlight the threat for widespread, significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding due to repeated rounds of severe thunderstorms. On December 19, 2017, and August 3, 2018, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Reno, Nevada, issued PDS red flag warnings to highlight the threat for potentially life- threatening fire danger due to strong gusty winds and low humidity. Issuance = PDS flash flood watch = PDS flash flood watches are issued when there is a higher-than-normal risk of widespread, life-threatening flash flooding. These watches are issued by local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, not the Storm Prediction Center. Below is the first PDS flash flood watch, which was issued by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 24, 2011, as mentioned above. = PDS flash flood warning = PDS flash flood warnings are issued when there is a higher than normal risk of widespread, life-threatening flash flooding. Like PDS flash flood watches, they are issued by the local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, rather than the Storm Prediction Center. Recently, they have been issued as PDS flash flood emergencies, most notably by the National Weather Service offices in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas. This warning was issued in the morning of May 30, 2018, by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Greenville–Spartanburg, South Carolina, while Subtropical Storm Alberto was affecting the area. It also contains the flash flood emergency phrase, which further underscores the risk of life-threatening flash flooding. = PDS high wind warning = PDS high wind warnings are issued by the National Weather Service when non-convective winds are expected to be especially damaging or dangerous to people and property, beyond what would be expected of a typical high wind warning. The warning below was issued by the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 8, 2020, for an extreme downslope wind event in Salt Lake City and the northern Wasatch Front. = PDS red flag warning = PDS red flag warnings are issued by the National Weather Service to inform the public that there is an unusually high threat of wildland fire combustion, and rapid spread of wildfires, due to very dry fuels, very low humidity levels, and strong winds. The PDS red flag warning below was issued by the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, on December 19, 2017. On August 3, 2018, the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, issued another PDS red flag warning to communicate the threat of life- threatening fire danger due to strong gusty winds and low humidity. = PDS severe thunderstorm watch = PDS severe thunderstorm watches are issued when there is a higher than normal risk of severe thunderstorm winds capable of major structural damage (in addition to large hail and perhaps a few isolated tornadoes), usually due to a strong and persistent derecho. These watches are very rare (accounting an average of only two each year), as the risk for tornadoes must remain low enough to not warrant a tornado watch (a normal tornado watch would be issued if the tornado risk is significant alongside the extreme wind threat). This PDS severe thunderstorm watch shown below was issued by the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, on July 19, 2019, for an extreme wind threat in northern Wisconsin. = PDS special marine warning = PDS Special marine warnings are issued by the National Weather Service to inform mariners of weather conditions that present a considerable threat to life and property. On April 19, 2018, the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. forecast office upgraded a special marine warning to PDS status as a gust front approached Chesapeake Bay. = PDS special weather statement = PDS special weather statements are usually for issued by the NWS for hazards that do not have a specific code of their own, and pose an exceptionally high risk of damage and loss of life. The PDS special weather statement below was issued by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York, on December 11, 2013, regarding extreme amounts of lake effect snow to impact the defined area. The same office issued a PDS Special Weather Statement for hurricane-force winds forecast to hit the Buffalo area on February 24, 2019. = PDS tornado watch = PDS tornado watches are issued when there is a higher than normal risk of multiple strong to violent tornadoes – especially those that are predicted to be long-track in nature, with path lengths of more than 20 miles – in the watch area (usually amounting to damage consistent with EF4 or EF5 tornadoes at maximum), in addition to including significant wind and hail damage. This enhanced wording in a Tornado Watch is meant to alert the public of the potential for very life-threatening severe weather. While there are no set criteria for a PDS watch to be issued, they are usually issued when the potential exists for a major tornado outbreak. These types of tornado watches represent about 90% of PDS watches issued by the Storm Prediction Center. PDS Tornado Watches are often issued on high risk days for severe weather. The PDS tornado watch shown below was issued on May 20, 2019. The most recent PDS Tornado Watches were Tornado Watch 106 and 110 on April 12, 2020 covering parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle. = PDS tornado warning = PDS tornado warnings are currently issued on an experimental basis by the 38 National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices within the Central Region. The criteria for a PDS warning are when a tornado on the ground has been spotted or confirmed, or a significant tornado is expected based on radar signatures. While the intention of this experimental warning may be to replace the loosely defined tornado emergency, PDS tornado warnings are structured as the second highest level of tornado warning within the impact based warning system (an experiment – which also includes tags within warning products illustrating radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes, and damage potential – participated by the 33 Weather Forecast Offices within the Central Region, as well as eight additional offices within the Western, Eastern and Southern regions that began utilizing the system in the spring of 2014); a tornado emergency, the highest warning level, is used within the United States for destructive tornadoes approaching more densely populated areas. These are the first warnings issued with PDS wording, and like PDS flash flood watches, are issued by local forecast offices. Below is an example of a PDS Tornado Warning from the Sandy Hook, Mississippi EF4 tornado on April 19, 2020. =PDS wind chill warning= PDS wind chill warnings are issued when there is an enhanced risk of frost bite, hypothermia, and eventually death due to extremely low wind chills. These warnings are issued by the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices rather than the Storm Prediction Center. The PDS wind chill warning shown below was issued by the National Weather Service in the Twin Cities on January 5, 2014. = Other watches and warnings = While the use of PDS wording for other types of watches and warnings has not been used, PDS wording could theoretically be applied to any kind of watch or warning to alert the public to weather events where there exists an increased risk of loss of life or widespread damage to property. Such situations could include PDS watches or warnings for blizzards, ice storms, or extreme heat. For example, on October 29, 2012 in advance of Hurricane Sandy, which was expected to become post- tropical prior to making landfall, a high wind warning was issued for New Jersey stating \\"This is an extremely dangerous situation!\\" Similarly, on May 26, 2015 during the flood disaster in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana, a flood warning was issued similar to a PDS flood warning stating \\"...This is a dangerous and life-threatening situation...\\" A severe thunderstorm warning bulletin issued by the National Weather Service at Tampa Bay/Ruskin regarding a strong, tornadic storm system moving through the area contained the following: \\"This storm may cause serious injury and significant property damage.\\"  References   External links  * NOAA-NWS Storm Prediction Center Category:Weather warnings and advisories Category:National Weather Service Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 1980s ","title":"Particularly dangerous situation"},{"id":"9796270","text":"is a 1972 Japanese kaiju film.

He was a professor at the University of Geneva from 1963 to 1969 and at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich until his retirement in 1999. In December 1996, he was appointed president of the Independent Commission of Experts: Switzerland - Second World War, often referred to as the Bergier commission, which examined the relationship of Switzerland with Nazi Germany during World War II. Personal life Bergier was born on 5 December 1931 in Lausanne, the son and grandson of Protestant pastors. Both sides of his family were solid members of Swiss bourgeois society. He was married twice and had two sons from his first marriage. Education Beginning his studies at the University of Lausanne, he went in 1950 to Paris where he studied both at the Ecole des Chartes and the Sorbonne where he was deeply influenced by the French historian Fernand Braudel and others of the Annales School. He studied at Oxford University and returned to Switzerland where he took his doctorate at the University of Geneva, writing a thesis on Geneva in the European economy of the Renaissance.François Walter in Le Temps Professional life Beginning his academic career as a professor at the University of Geneva in 1963, he moved in 1969 to the prestigious History of Civilizations chair at the polytechnic in Zurich where he remained until his retirement in 1999. In 1983 he published a book, Economic History of Switzerland. In addition to his work as a medieval and economic historian, he was interested in the history of the Alps and helped to found an international association for the history of the Alps in 1995.François Walter in Le Temps Independent Commission of Experts During the post-WWII period, Switzerland came under criticism for its war-time behavior vis-a-vis the Nazi Government in Germany. In 1996 the Swiss parliament set up the Independent Commission of Experts with wide powers to examine Switzerland's role during the war. Jean- François Bergier was asked to head the commission as its president, a role which he accepted in December 1996 and carried out until the final report was issued in 2001 and the commission was dissolved.Daily Telegraph, 5 November 2009 The final report of the commission was damning, shattering many myths about the Swiss government's wartime policies and behaviour. The lengthy series of in-depth reports documented the restrictive policy of Switzerland toward Jewish refugees during the Holocaust and it identified a number of controversial relationships between Swiss and German companies and financial institutions which acted to support the German war effort. In particular, with respect to the refugees, Bergier concluded, \\"that Switzerland \\"got involved in (Nazi) crimes by abandoning refugees to their persecutors\\" – even though the Swiss government knew by 1942 of the Nazis' final solution and that rejected refugees would almost certainly face deportation and death...Large numbers of persons whose lives were in danger were turned away – needlessly,...\\"Daily Telegraph, 5 November 2009 The reports of the commission (see: https://www.uek.ch/en/) stirred up political criticism, with right-wing People's Party member Oskar Freysinger incorrectly describing it as \\"a pseudo- historical work ordered up by the World Jewish Congress\\". When asked why he accepted such an investigative and editing role, Bergier replied, \\"Above all there's the issue of Switzerland's historical responsibility. You have to be responsible for your past. On that condition you can face the future clearly and calmly.\\"Daily Telegraph, 5 November 2009 Principal writings (in French) *Histoire économique de la Suisse, Lausanne, Payot, 1984 *Hermès et Clio: essais d’histoire économique, Lausanne, Payot, 1984 *Naissance et croissance de la Suisse industrielle, Berne, Francke, 1974 *Une histoire du sel, Fribourg, Office du Livre, 1982 *Guillaume Tell, Paris, Fayard, 1988 *Europe et les Suisses.

Founded in 1992, LECOM confers degrees in osteopathic medicine (D.O.), pharmacy (PharmD), and dentistry (DMD), as well as master's degrees in Health Services Administration, Biomedical Sciences, and Medical Education. LECOM operates one of the few accelerated three-year pharmacy programs in the country, and is one of 2 pharmacy schools in the country with a distance education program. With over 2,200 enrolled medical students, the College of Osteopathic Medicine at LECOM is the largest in the United States. LECOM is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the American Osteopathic Association's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, the Commission on Dental Accreditation, and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. History Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine was founded in 1992. The first courses began in 1993, and the inaugural class of students graduated in 1997. In 2002, the school of pharmacy opened. In 2004, LECOM opened a branch campus in Bradenton, Florida, and in 2009 opened a new satellite campus in Greensburg, Pennsylvania at the site of Seton Hill University. In 2007, Lake Erie COM was the first US medical school to re-introduce a three-year medical school program, after the other 3 year programs in the nation had closed. In 2008, LECOM received approval to open an additional branch campus in Greensburg, Pennsylvania at the site of Seton Hill University. The branch campus included two additional buildings, with an overall projected cost of $4 million. In 2012, the Bradenton campus opened a new dental school. In 2020, LECOM plans to open a new medical school campus in Elmira, New York. The medical school at LECOM is the largest in the United States. The college's total enrollment now exceeds 4100 students and has more than 11,000 alumni. LECOM is a member of the LECOM Health system, an academic health center with two hospitals, physician practices, two skilled nursing centers and three independent living centers for older adults. Academics =Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine= The medical school offers three primary learning pathways: a traditional lecture discussion Program, a problem-based learning program, and a directed study program, as well as two, three-year programs, all leading to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree. The Erie campus offers all three primary pathways, while the Bradenton and Greensburg campuses offer curriculum based solely on problem-based learning. The Problem-Based Learning Pathway (PBL) emphasizes student-centered self- directed learning through small group interaction, with limited faculty involvement. The PBL pathway is the sole pathway offered at the Bradenton and Greensburg campuses. The Lecture Discussion Pathway (LDP) is a traditional curriculum where subjects are taught in a lecture format. Basic science courses include gross anatomy, biochemistry, immunology, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and physiology. Clinical sciences are taught in a systems-based format. The Directed Study Pathway (DSP) is a unique program, which begins with significant daily classroom time in the first semester, which then transitions into specific \\"directed study\\" modules for the duration of the first two years of medical school. The Erie campus offers two accelerated pathways to primary care: the Primary Care Scholars Pathway (PCSP) and the Accelerated Physician Assistant Pathway. The Primary Care Scholars program condenses four years of medical education into three years in order to graduate primary care physicians more quickly, and is intended for students interested in family medicine. The Accelerated Physician Assistant Pathway is a fast-tracked, three-year medical school curriculum, which is designed for applicants that have already completed a physician assistant program. PCSP Applicants must make a commitment to completing an primary care residency upon graduation. After two years of preclinical education on one of the LECOM campuses, third-year and fourth-year students continue their clinical education at teaching hospitals and physicians offices. To ensure quality medical training, LECOM has affiliations with more than 100 facilities in nine states. LECOM has also developed regional campuses for clinical education in Northwestern Pennsylvania, Southwestern Pennsylvania, New York City, NY Southern Tier, California/San Diego, Northeast Florida, Southeast Florida and Greater Florida regions. Post-graduate residence and fellowship training is managed by the Lake Erie Consortium for Osteopathic Medical Training. =Doctor of Pharmacy= The School of Pharmacy offers three pathways for the Doctor of Pharmacy program. One is a year-round, three-year curriculum based on the Erie campus, while another is a four-year traditional curriculum offered at the Bradenton campus. In 2014, the School of Pharmacy added a four- year distance education pathway for students across the United States. LECOM and Creighton University offer the only two distance education pathways for the primary PharmD degree in the nation. =Doctor of Dental Medicine= The School of Dental Medicine opened in mid July 2012 to its inaugural class of 100 dental students. The School of Dental Medicine (SDM) prepares students for the practice of general dentistry. First-year dental students participate in problem-based learning as they prepare for clinical training. The SDM operates full-service dental practice offices in Bradenton where third-year students treat patients under the supervision of licensed dentists. In May 2015, the School opened outreach training sites in Erie, PA and DeFuniak Springs, FL. Fourth-year dental students complete their clinical training at these offices. =Graduate Studies= LECOM offers four master's degree programs. In January 2014, the College began the Master in Health Services Administration (MHSA) program. The LECOM MHSA Program provides students with the knowledge and skills required to plan, direct, and coordinate medical and health services while working as administrators in hospital or other healthcare facilities, public health care organizations, and private practice groups. The knowledge gained from the MHSA is essential for fiscal, planning and managerial work in healthcare organizations and the establishment and management of clinical practices. In 2017, the College started the Master of Science in Biomedical Ethics degree. The MSBE helps healthcare workers develop cultural competency in today's diverse healthcare environment and demonstrates how ethics education leads to behavioral changes that result in a higher level of professionalism and the delivery of top-quality, patient-centered care. In 2018, LECOM received approval for the School of Health Services Administration (SHSA) to manage the MHSA and MSBE programs. The Master of Science in Medical Education program is designed for healthcare professionals interested in teaching at doctoral and the post-graduate medical education level. A distance option is available with online coursework. The Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences is a two-year program for students interested in careers in medicine, pharmacy and other health and science related professions. The biomedical sciences program is a graduate-level program intended for post baccalaureate students who wish to enhance their understanding of the biomedical sciences and improve their overall profile to gain admission to medical school, pharmacy school, a biomedical Ph.D. program or enter the biomedical science workplace (e.g. the pharmaceutical industry). The Master of Medical Science (MMS) program is a one-year, non-thesis program introduced in 2016 that is designed to academically, scientifically, and professionally prepare students who are interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy. This graduate program is offered exclusively at the LECOM Bradenton campus located in Bradenton, Florida. The Health Sciences Post-Baccalaureate Program is a two-semester post baccalaureate certificate program designed to enhance the basic science credentials of students interested in pharmacy or medical school. All coursework is conducted on the LECOM campus by the medical and pharmacy school facilities. Campus The main campus is located on West Grandview Blvd. in Erie, Pennsylvania, and overlooks Lake Erie. In 2002, the College expanded the main building with a three-story addition which included classroom, laboratory and office space for the School of Pharmacy. In 2011, the college purchased the LORD Corporation Technology Center on adjoining property. The purchase allowed LORD Corporation to keep its Erie operations by moving to a new location just south of the city. LECOM uses what is now the west campus for the LECOM Erie Dental Offices, research labs, and additional classroom space. The college also owns One LECOM Place overlooking Presque Isle Bay in Erie. Additional LECOM facilities in Erie include the John M. and Silvia Ferretti Medical Fitness and Wellness Center which houses a fitness center and clinical offices for Medical Associates of Erie (MAE) one of the LECOM Health affiliates along with Millcreek Community Hospital, Corry Memorial Hospital, the LECOM Senior Living Center, LECOM Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, the Independent Living Communities of Parkside Westminster, Parkside North East, and Regency at South Shore; Visiting Nurses Association of Erie County, and LifeWorks Erie. LECOM Bradenton is located in the managed community of Lakewood Ranch near Sarasota and Bradenton, Fla. The original campus building houses the College of Osteopathic Medicine and the School of Pharmacy. The School of Dental Medicine (SDM) is located just north of the original building. Half of the building houses the classrooms, laboratories and offices for the SDM and the SHSA. The other side of the building has dental offices where third-year dental students begin clinical training treating patients from the surrounding communities. LECOM at Seton Hill is an extension of the LECOM Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine classes. Classrooms, laboratories and offices are housed in two buildings on the Seton Hill University Campus. In 2018, LECOM received accreditation for a second extension in Elmira, NY for the LECOM Erie. The college will construct a new building on the Elmira College Campus with classes scheduled to start in 2020. Professional sports partnerships LECOM officially partnered with the Erie BayHawks of the NBA G (Development) League in 2008. As part of those respective deals, LECOM provides medical coverage to both teams. Additionally, the LECOM's name is featured on the BayHawks' jerseys and court design at Erie Insurance Arena. The BayHawks work out and practice at the LECOM Medical Fitness and Wellness Center. LECOM maintains a similar partnership with the Erie Commodores soccer team. In February 2017, LECOM purchased the naming rights to LECOM Park (formerly called McKechnie Field), the spring training home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and their Single-A affiliate, the Bradenton Marauders.

Initially, the road up to the settlement was unpaved, water was brought by truck, and electricity was sporadically provided by a generator. The next phase of development involved the placement of sixty caravans to serve as homes, offices, security compound, award-winning Preschool facilities, Clinic, Youth Center, Library, Weaving and Art Studios, and Computer Center. Construction of a new neighborhood of twenty-five permanent homes began in 1992. This included the building of a Family Health Center, an industrial building housing both the Weaving Studio and a Simcha Hall for special events and an outdoor basketball court.

He won the right to succeed Clyde C. Holloway, who did not seek reelection and died during the ensuing campaign to choose Holloway's successor on the commission. Earlier from 1994 to 2000, Francis was the chair of the Republican Party in Louisiana. A staunch fiscal and social conservative, Francis was an unsuccessful candidate for Secretary of State of Louisiana in the special election held on September 30, 2006. Francis indicated that he would seek the position again in the nonpartisan blanket primary on October 20, 2007, but he failed to file his qualification papers. \\"I will work to ensure the right to vote. I will fight to stop voter fraud, vote buying, and vote stealing,\\" Francis vowed in his campaign for secretary of state. As the Republican state chairman, Francis challenged the political order, including an effort to unseat most of Governor Edwin Washington Edwards' floor leaders in the Louisiana State Senate in the 1995 elections. In the 1996 Louisiana presidential caucus won by the journalist and commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, Francis supported then U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who soon left the race and deferred to the eventual nominee, former Senator Robert J. Dole of Kansas. Francis was mentioned as a potential Republican candidate for the District 4 seat on the Public Service Commission, which was filled in a special election on April 4, 2008, to replace Dale Sittig of Eunice, who resigned to become director of the Louisiana Offshore Terminal Authority. Ultimately, the Republican Clyde Holloway of Rapides Parish won the remaining nineteen months of Sittig's term. Background Born in Jena in La Salle Parish in North Louisiana, Francis became wealthy in the oil processing business from his base in Acadiana. His company is based in Crowley in Acadia Parish, a rice-growing region in southwestern Louisiana, which produced two of the state's political giants of the late 20th century, Democrats Edwin Edwards and John B. Breaux. Francis also has a residence in Lafayette. Francis is the chief executive officer for Francis Drilling Fluids, Ltd. FDF, one of the oldest drilling fluids companies on the Gulf Coast. He employs more than 350 people at locations in Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. The corporate headquarters is located in Crowley. State Senate race, 1996 When Republican Governor Murphy J. \\"Mike\\" Foster, Jr., named Democratic state Senator Cecil Picard as education secretary, a special election was held on August 24, 1996, to begin the process of choosing Picard's state senate successor. State Representative Gerald Theunissen, a Democrat who later switched to Republican affiliation, led the contest with 7,086 votes (29.5 percent). Francis, still state party chairman and the only Republican among the six candidates, finished in second place with 6,112 votes (25.5 percent). Four other Democrats shared the remaining but crucial 45 percent of the ballots cast. In the runoff election on September 21, Theunissen defeated Francis, 20,320 (55.7 percent) to 16,172 (44.3 percent). Run for secretary of state The secretary of state is Louisiana's top elections officer. The office maintains corporation and government records. \\"We have had a lot of criticism about professional politicians in this state. ... People are crying out for change. Most are demanding it. ... Our problems are not Republican or Democrat problems. They are all our problems, and we need to face them together. We need sound business principles in Baton Rouge and not more politics. To attract business, we need leaders who know how to talk business, not politics,\\" Francis said. Francis had promised, if elected, that he would take a business approach to the secretary of state's office and work to create jobs and to ensure \\"clean elections,\\" for which he noted Louisiana has often been lacking. Loss to Jay Dardenne Francis lost the race to fellow Republican Jay Dardenne, an attorney and then state senator from Baton Rouge, now the state Commissioner of Administration. The election was held to finish the fifteen months remaining in the term of Republican W. Fox McKeithen, who died in the summer of 2005. Al Ater, a former Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from Ferriday in Concordia Parish, had succeeded to the position because he was McKeithen's first deputy. The special election was held in conjunction with the nonpartisan blanket primary for other offices contested in 2006. Francis ran third in the race, based largely on his support in mostly rural and small-town parishes in his native north Louisiana. He received 26 percent of the vote. Democratic state Senator Francis C. Heitmeier polled 28 percent, and Dardenne led the field with 30 percent. None of the other four candidates had more than 9 percent. Dardenne was hence scheduled to face a runoff election with Heitmeier of New Orleans. In the meantime, Francis announced that he would not support Dardenne in the second balloting but would run again for the position in 2007. Heitmeier pulled out of the race and left Dardenne unopposed. Heitmeier and Dardenne were term-limited in the state Senate and ineligible to have sought reelection in 2007. Heitmeier was succeeded by his brother, David Heitmeier, a New Orleans optometrist. Election to the PSC Francis finally won an election when in 2016 he secured a majority in a three-candidate field to select Clyde Holloway's successor on the Public Service Commission. Francis received 175,274 votes (54 percent) to 43,106 (13 percent) for his fellow Republican businessman, Reldon R. Owens of Alexandria, and 108,243 (33 percent) for the Democrat Mary Leach Werner (born January 1968) of Lake Charles, the older daughter of former U.S. Representative Buddy Leach of Louisiana's 4th congressional district. Governor John Bel Edwards appointed his fellow Democrat, former state House Speaker Charles W. DeWitt, Jr., of Rapides Parish to fill the two months and ten days left in Holloway's term. Francis assumes the position on January 1, 2017.

Beal went missing on September 15, 1990 and was found three weeks later in two garbage bags. She had been decapitated and dismembered. Džurlić changed his name to Tulja after fleeing the U.S., with his third wife, following Beal's murder. Tulja/Džurlić is suspected of being the \\"Butcher of Mons\\", in the mid-1990s. He had fled to the Belgian city, still with his third wife, sometime after the murder of Mary Beal. The female victims in Belgium share the similarity of being found dismembered and in garbage bags scattered across the city. Two dismembered female murder victims were found in Albania in 2006. Albanian police asked the American Embassy Regional Security Office for assistance, who coordinated with the FBI resulting in a chain of events that did not solve the Albanian deaths, but did link NYPD to the FBI investigation and Tulja/Džurlić's 2007 arrest in Montenegro by local authorities. That country had just declared independence in 2006, and did not yet have an extradition treaty with the U.S. The Montenegrin court system tried him for Beal's murder in New York City, convicting him in June 2010 and sending him to jail for 12 years a few weeks later. The FBI/NYPD believe that Tulja/Džurlić may have committed at least eight total murders in Belgium (five), Albania (two) and America (Beal), though Belgian and Albanian police have not made any conclusive connections to those murders.

Life and career  = School and Youth Level = Though Edinburgh born, the earliest account of young Alan's precocious footballing talent recalls a blonde eight-year-old scoring freely for Sunnybank Primary School in Aberdeen. The family sojourn in the North East was brief, however, and back home in Edinburgh, he thrived as part of the Murrayburn Primary School which had won The School Board Cup in 1954, 1955 and 1956 and four other trophies in those three seasons. He was selected to play for Edinburgh Primary Schools and would go on to captain the team that beat Bellshill Primary Schools 3–0 in the second leg of the Scottish Cup Final for the Wilson Trophy at Tynecastle, winning 4–2 on aggregate. Gordon scored once in a match which was played on 14 May 1956, his twelfth birthday. Naturally left footed, he was by now confirmed in the inside left position. Despite winning a scholarship to the rugby union-playing George Heriot's School, and trying rugby for one season, Gordon continued to nurture his footballing prowess. Initially, for two seasons, he turned out for his local Boys Brigade 43rd Company team and then, for a single season, for Sighthill Thistle who finished second in the Lothian Amateur Under 18 League. The following season, Alan was playing for the Scottish Juvenile (Under 18) side, Edinburgh Athletic. With his awareness in the box, lethal left foot and uncanny heading ability he proved a perfect foil for the mesmeric wing play and crossing of teammate, Willie Henderson and he scored 120 goals in 80 games over two seasons. In the 1959/60 season Edinburgh Athletic won the prestigious Lord Weir Cup at New Meadowbank, beating league rivals Edina Hearts 4–1 in the final with both Gordon and Henderson on target. By the time Henderson had completed his final appearance before moving to Rangers, Gordon had scored twice and Athletic had trounced Edina Hearts again, this time 9–1 in the Insurance Cup final at Saughton Enclosure. The consolation goal for Edina near the end of the game that day was scored by John Greig, who also signed for Rangers that summer. Gordon had already signed a provisional contract with Hearts in early September 1959 at the age of 15 and, henceforth, would train twice a week at Tynecastle. = Hearts = Having scored 13 goals in eight games for the reserves, Alan made his first team debut at Hearts, whilst still a pupil at Heriots, in a 1st Division match on 21 October 1961 against reigning League champions Celtic at Tynecastle . He was now 17 and his opposite man that day was the redoubtable Scotland international \\"right half\\", Pat Crerand. In only his second match, he played in the 1961 Scottish League Cup Final against Rangers at Hampden in front of 88,000 fans . He was fouled for the penalty from which John Cumming equalised for Hearts but the game finished a draw and he did not play in the replay, which Hearts lost. Gordon scored his first goal in senior football on his fourth appearance in an away league match against Raith Rovers and it proved the winner. He scored again in the next game at home against Motherwell but Hearts lost 6–2. In that maiden season he made 22 league appearances scoring 5 goals, including a double in a 4–1 victory against Hibs at Easter Road, with a further hat-trick coming in a Scottish Cup tie against Vale of Leithen. The highlight for the schoolboy may have been turning out on several occasions alongside Hearts' idolised forward, Willie Bauld and the friendships he struck up with other teammates such as Danny Ferguson and Billy Higgins. Gordon continued his studies after leaving Heriot's and gained a Master of Arts degree in Economics from the University of Edinburgh, where he also studied Moral Philosophy and Spanish Literature. By the 1964–65 season he had developed into a first team regular, scoring 23 times as the Maroons narrowly missed out on the League title. = Dundee United = Following a spell in South Africa in 1967 and 1968, where he played for Durban United and worked as a company representative for Beare Brothers, Gordon left Tynecastle permanently in 1969 when Jerry Kerr paid £8,000 to take him to Dundee United. While with the Tannadice club he remained Edinburgh- based as he was now studying towards his professional Chartered Accountancy qualification, training twice a week with the Terrors. When Jim McLean was appointed manager a policy requiring all United players to live in Tayside was instigated, however, Gordon refused. = Hibernian = Eddie Turnbull paid £12,000 to take Gordon back to Edinburgh, but this time with Hibernian. It was with the Easter Road side that he enjoyed his career highlights. In 1972–73 he helped Hibs to victory in the League Cup and Drybrough Cup, while the following season they retained the Drybrough Cup. He also featured in one of the most celebrated matches in Hibs' history, the 7–0 victory over rivals Hearts in the 1 January 1973 derby, a match in which he scored the second and seventh goals. = Dundee = Despite this success, Gordon was sold to Dundee for £13,000 in 1974, earning the unique distinction of having represented both of Dundee and Edinburgh's senior sides. His spell with the Dark Blues was less successful, however. Following their last-day relegation in 1976, due to a goal difference inferior to his former side United, Gordon retired from football aged 32. = After football = After ending his playing career, Gordon continued to work in the accountancy profession, with his clients including Irvine Welsh. During the 1980s, he co-presented the \\"Sportsbeat\\" programme on Radio Forth. He also appeared regularly on Scotsport with Arthur Montford and continued to work as a football reporter on both radio and television. In addition, following the election of Archie McPherson as Rector, by dint of being a graduate of that establishment, he was asked to undertake a three-year period of office as Rector's Assessor at the University of Edinburgh. Gordon died on 18 February 2010, from a brain tumour, having suffered a recurrence of the cancer which had initially prompted the removal of part of his tongue eight years earlier and which curtailed his media involvement.

In 1966 he became leader of CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, taking over from James Farmer A supporter of Black Power, he turned CORE into a more radical movement. In 1968, McKissick left CORE to found Soul City in Warren County, North Carolina. He endorsed Richard Nixon for president that year, and the federal government, under President Nixon, supported Soul City. He became a state district court judge in 1990 and died on April 28, 1991.

He returned to his native state North Carolina, and applied to the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Law. He was subsequently denied admission because of his race. After his denial, he enrolled in North Carolina College (NCC) School of Law, now North Carolina Central University (NCCU), in Durham, North Carolina, which was the law school for blacks. While in NCC's Law School, the NAACP accepted McKissick's case, and filed a lawsuit against UNC School of Law. Thurgood Marshall led the NAACP defense. In 1951, a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals allowed McKissick and three other students admission to UNC's School of Law. At the time of the ruling, McKissick had nearly finished his law degree from NCC, but he took courses at UNC School of Law during the summer of 1951. McKissick was in the first group of black students to be admitted at UNC School of Law. Law efforts In 1955, McKissick established a law firm in Durham, NC. His law firm was involved with civil rights issues and his clients included the first black undergraduates to attend UNC-Chapel Hill in 1955. He successfully defended sit-in protesters of the Durham's Royal Ice Cream Parlor in 1957, and the families who integrated Durham's city school system in 1959. The lead plaintiffs in the 1959 school desegregation case were his daughter, Joycelyn, and his wife, Evelyn.\\"And Justice for All  Floyd B. McKissick, Lawyer and Nationally Recognized Civil Rights Activist.\\" Durham County Library, n.d. Web. March 8, 2013. As a lawyer, McKissick's most publicized efforts involved a segregated black local in the Tobacco Workers International, an AFL-CIO member. McKissick pressed to have black workers admitted to the skilled scale without loss of their seniority rating. Involvement with CORE Civil rights leaders meeting with President John F. Kennedy in 1963. McKissick stands at the far left. After the Greensboro sit-in at Woolworth's lunch counter on February 1, 1960 Gordon Carey and James T. McCain, CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) field secretaries, were sent to the Carolinas to help with the negotiating of department store owners and to spark interest in more sit-ins. Carey was introduced to McKissick during this time. \\"Carey helped McKissick and students organize the demonstrations that broke out on February 8th in Durham, and in the course of the next few weeks the two men travelled over the state setting up non-violent workshops.\\" McKissick handled legal affairs for both the NAACP and CORE, but he withdrew from the NAACP. After leaving the NAACP and showing loyalty to CORE, he was elected to the CORE national chairmanship at the 1963 Convention.Meier, August, and Elliott M. Rudwick. CORE: A Study in the Civil Rights Movement, 1942-1968. New York: Oxford UP, 1973. Print. When Floyd McKissick replaced James Farmer as head of CORE on January 3, 1966, the organization completed a 180-degree turn that saw it change from an interracial integrationist civil rights agency pledged to uphold nonviolence into a militant and uncompromising advocate of the ideology of black power. In 1966, James Meredith challenged America's social system of poverty, racial segregation, and white supremacy by vowing to walk alone from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi. McKissick who had not recently been elected head of CORE, promised to support Meredith in his journey. Along with Martin Luther King, Jr. and Stokely Carmichael, McKissick assisted in leading a group of demonstrators the remaining 194 miles to Jackson, Mississippi.Joseph, Peniel E. Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America. New York: Henry Holt and, 2006. Print. McKissick states, \\"We issued the call to bring all the organizations together to continue the march at the spot where he fell.\\"Interview by Jack Bas and Walter Devries. Documenting the American South: Oral Histories of the American South. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, December 6, 1973. Web. 06 Mar. 2013. McKissick and Roy Innis, who at that time was the head of the Harlem chapter of CORE, appeared to be close allies, but there were underlying tensions. When McKissick left CORE in 1968, Innis took over. Soul City Soul City, 1975 After leaving CORE, McKissick launched a plan to build a new community, Soul City, in Warren County, North Carolina on 500 acres of farmland. McKissick stated,\\" Soul City was an idea before the movement. Soul City actually started after World War II, in my mind. And it was first talked about when we saw the use of the Marshall Plan, and all like that. See, I've always been in real estate and I've always been a businessman.\\" Soul City was supposed to reverse out-migration of minorities and the poor to urban areas. Soul City was a town intended for all, but placed emphasis on providing opportunities for minorities and the poor. The venture received a $14 million bond issue guarantee from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a loan of $500,000 form the First Pennsylvania Bank. The state of North Carolina also gave $1.7 million and private donors gave about $1 million. With this funding, McKissick built a state-of-the art water system, a health care clinic, and a massive steel-and-glass factory named Soultech I. Soul City was projected to have 24,000 jobs and 44,000 inhabitants by the year 2004.McKissick, Floyd B. Soul City North Carolina. Soul City, NC, 1974. Print. Soul City, however, ran into difficulties and the project never developed as McKissick had hoped. In June 1980, the Soul City Corporation and the federal government reached an agreement that would allow the government to assume control the following January. Under the agreement, the company retained 88 acres of the project, including the site of a mobile home park and a 60,000-square-foot building that had served as the project's headquarters. The Department of Housing & Urban Development paid off $10 million in loans and agreed to pay an additional $175,000 of the project's debts. In exchange, McKissick agreed to drop a lawsuit brought to block HUD from shutting down the project. Later life and death In June 1990, Floyd McKissick was appointed a state district court judge in the Ninth Judicial District in North Carolina, by Republican Governor James G. Martin. Less than a year after being appointed, while also working as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Soul City, McKissick died of lung cancer at the age 69 on Sunday April 28, 1991. He was buried in Soul City. He was survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Williams, whom he married in 1942; a son, Floyd McKissick, Jr; three daughters, Joycelyn, Andree, and Charmaine.

Life  His parents emigrated to the United States when he was five years old. From 1895 he lived in Brooklyn and came into contact with some of the best chess players of the country. He had his first successes with simultaneous games, among other things winning in December 1894 versus the acting United States Chess Champion Jackson Whipps Showalter. At the beginning of 1896 he, despite his young age, became a member of the Brooklyn Chess Club and won the club championship later that year, at the age of 15. In the same year he defeated the later grandmaster Frank James Marshall in a match, winning 7:1 with 3 draws. 1897 saw him win a tournament game against ex-world champion Wilhelm Steinitz. At the beginning of 1899 Napier traveled to Europe, in order to study music there, and visited the chess clubs of London, Paris and Berlin. In 1900 he returned to the US and established himself in Pittsburgh. There he wrote the chess column of the newspaper Pittsburgh Dispatch. In 1901, he won a master tournament in Buffalo versus Eugene Delmar, placing behind tournament winner Harry Nelson Pillsbury, but still above Marshall. This success encouraged him to participate in the following years in some international master tournaments. He played in Monte Carlo and Hanover in 1902 as well as in Cambridge Springs in 1904. He won none of those tournaments, but in each case received a special prize for brilliantly played games, for example winning the Rothschild Brilliancy Prize for his game against Mikhail Chigorin. In July 1904, he visited Great Britain and won a well-attended tournament in London against Richard Teichmann, Joseph Henry Blackburne and Isidor Gunsberg. Subsequently, he participated in the British championship in Hastings, where he was, because of his English birth, entitled to take part, and won the tournament against Henry Atkins, whom he defeated in the pass fight with 2.5-1.5, to become the first British Chess Federation Champion. Thereafter, Atkins became the most dominant player in the history of the British Championship, winning the next nine championships in which he competed. In 1905 Napier played two matches: against Jacques Mieses the match was undecided (4-4 with 2 draws), against Teichmann he lost 1-5 with 4 draws. Afterwards Napier withdrew from the international tournament arena. He gained American citizenship in 1908 and began a career at an insurance company, becoming vice president of the Scranton Insurance Company. He married Florence Gillespie (Pillsbury's niece), with whom he later had two daughters. Although he still participated in chess, he played no more important tournaments. When he died at the age of 71, his chess career was nearly forgotten. His best historical Elo number was 2662. He was, at the time, 11th place in the world.  Lasker  Napier called a game he lost to reigning World Champion Emanuel Lasker at Cambridge Springs 1904 the best of his career. The game showed great tactical skill by both players. Napier was particularly impressed by how Lasker kept his composure in severe time pressure. Lasker said afterwards to his young opponent: \\"It is your brilliancy, even though I won it.\\" Lasker - Napier 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 g6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Bg7 6.Be3 d6 7.h3 Nf6 8.g4 O-O 9.g5 Ne8 10.h4 Nc7 11.f4 e5 12.Nde2 d5 13.exd5 Nd4 14.Nxd4 Nxd5 15.Nf5 Nxc3 16.Qxd8 Rxd8 17.Ne7+ Kh8 18.h5 Re8 19.Bc5 gxh5 20.Bc4 exf4 21.Bxf7 Ne4 22.Bxe8 Bxb2 23.Rb1 Bc3+ 24.Kf1 Bg4 25.Bxh5 Bxh5 26.Rxh5 Ng3+ 27.Kg2 Nxh5 28.Rxb7 a5 29.Rb3 Bg7 30.Rh3 Ng3 31.Kf3 Ra6 32.Kxf4 Ne2+ 33.Kf5 Nc3 34.a3 Na4 35.Be3 1-0Lasker- Napier, Cambridge Springs 1904  Quotes  * \\"Of Chess it has been said that life is not long enough for it.

TEM / TDEM methods are generally able to determine subsurface electrical properties, but are also sensitive to subsurface magnetic properties in applications like UXO detection and characterization. TEM/TDEM surveys are a very common surface EM technique for mineral exploration, groundwater exploration, and for environmental mapping, used throughout the world in both onshore and offshore applications.  Physical principles  Helicopter Conducting TDEM Survey Two fundamental electromagnetic principles are required to derive the physics behind TEM surveys: Faraday's law of induction and Lenz's Law. A loop of wire is generally energized by a direct current. At some time (t0) the current is cut off as quickly as possible. Faraday's law dictates that a nearly identical current is induced in the subsurface to preserve the magnetic field produced by the original current (eddy currents). Due to ohmic losses, the induced surface currents dissipate—this causes a change in the magnetic field, which induces subsequent eddy currents. The net result is a downward and outward diffusion of currents in the subsurface which appear as an expanding smoke ring Nabighian, M.N., 1979, Quasi-static Transient Response of a Conducting Half-Space – an Approximate Representation. Geophysics, Vol. 44, No. 10 (October 1979), pp. 1700-1705 when the current density is contoured.Nabighian, M. and J. Macnae, 1991, Time domain electromagnetic prospecting methods, Chapter 6 in Electromagnetic Methods in Applied Geophysics, Volume 2, M. Nabighian Ed., Society of Exploration Geophysicists. These currents produce a magnetic field by Faraday's law. At the surface, the change in magnetic field [flux] with time is measured. The way the currents diffuse in the subsurface is related to the conductivity distribution in the ground.J. D. McNeill, 1980, Applications of Transient Electromagnetic Techniques, Technical Note 7, Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario. This is a basic view of the physical principles involved. When conductive bodies are present, the diffusion of the transients is changed. In addition, transients are induced in the conductive bodies as well. This is only the most basic overview. The paper by McNeill is freely available from the Geonics website explaining the basics of the method.  TEM/TDEM instrumentation and sensors  TEM/TDEM systems consist of a transmitter instrument, transmitting coil or transmitting wire, receiver coil or antenna, and receiver instrument. Depending on subsurface resistivity, current induced, receiver sensitivity and transmitter-receiver geometry, TEM/TDEM measurements allow geophysical exploration from a few metres below the surface to several hundred metres of depth. Low-power TEM/TDEM instruments can operate using C-cell batteries, and mid-range systems (approx. 2.5 kW) can operate with automotive batteries; more powerful systems (20 kW~150 kW) require a separate generator usually mounted on a truck, plane, or helicopter to provide the necessary current for deep investigations.

Background Jim French was bred by Ralph Wilson, owner of the National Football League Buffalo Bills. He was by Graustark and out of Dinner Partner. Despite his first-rate pedigree, Jim French was small and dull brown. He was trained by John P. Campo, Racing career =1970: two-year-old season= As a juvenile, Jim French was put through a regimen that would be heavily criticized now. Campo put the two-year-old through 11 races in a space of four months. In November 1970 alone, he raced four times, winning the Remsen Stakes. In December, Campo took Jim French to Florida in order to prepare him for the Kentucky Derby. On December 26, 1970, Jim French fought Sir Dagonet for a win in the Miami Beach Handicap at Tropical Park. =1971: three-year-old season= In early January, Jim French won the Dade Metropolitan Handicap by a nose, carrying top weight. Eleven days later, he came fast in the Hibiscus Stakes at Hialeah, only to be beaten by Executioner. Another two weeks later, closing from 10th place, Jim French ran past His Majesty in the Bahamas Stakes. Two weeks passed, and he was only a head behind His Majesty in the Everglades Stakes. Once again, two weeks later, he finished third behind Executioner from 19 lengths in the Flamingo Stakes. Campo shipped him to New York to run 17 days later in the Bay Shore Stakes against Hoist The Flag. Jim French ran a blistering 1:21. Only one week later in Florida, he was run in the Florida Derby finishing third to Eastern Fleet, running the race a hair off the stakes record. Jim French was flown to California to run one week later in the Santa Anita Derby, which he won. Back in New York two weeks later, he ran in the Wood Memorial. Jim French had competed in 10 stakes in over four months. Now he arrived in Kentucky to race in the Kentucky Derby. In the Derby, he was a fast closing second to Canonero II, beating Bold Reason. In Canonero II's track record-breaking Preakness Stakes, Jim French was third. In the Belmont Stakes, he again came on fast to take second to Pass Catcher. Campo entered Jim French in the Arlington Classic (then called the Pontiac Grand Prix). Three weeks later, yet again shipped to California, he placed in the Hollywood Derby. He lost to Bold Reason, who carried thirteen fewer pounds. One week later in New York, Jim French won the Dwyer Stakes, giving away 12 to 15 pounds to the rest of the field. In this short time, he was never less than fourth (not counting one disqualification). He ran at 10 tracks in six states and flew across the country four times. Four weeks later, he was ninth in the Monmouth Handicap (now called the Philip H. Iselin Stakes). After the race, he was found to have a spur in his right knee. Rumors flew that Jim French had \\"been got to.\\" His owner claimed the horse had lost by \\"a nefarious act.\\" Jim French went to Saratoga, New York, for the Travers Stakes. Before he could race, he was impounded by the Saratoga County sheriff's office, and his entry was refused by the track's stewards. State steward Francis P. Dunne called it \\"...the most complex racing situation I've ever encountered.\\" \\"The Unbreakable, Indestructible Jim French\\" The Blood- Horse Magazine November 11, 2008 Jim French seemed to be owned by two people: Frank Caldwell and Etta Sarant. Caldwell proclaimed early in August 1971 that he had sold a 70% interest in the horse to Mrs. George Sarant, wife of a Long Island automobile dealer. Jim French ran in the name of Etta Sarant at Monmouth, where he finished ninth in the $100,000 Monmouth Invitational, but when the horse was shipped back to Saratoga it was revealed by New York racing officials that Mrs. Sarant did not have a New York owner's license.\\"A Thoroughbred Can of Worms\\" Sports Illustrated August 30, 1971 Campo said at the time that the Sarants, after only a few weeks of ownership, had let their 70% go to Fred R. Cole, a construction executive from Long Island. Cole wired the NYRA stewards on the eve of the Travers in an attempt to satisfy them of the legitimacy of his ownership of the horse and his eligibility to run Travers Stakes the next day. However, the appeal to the stewards was too late as entries for the Travers had closed the morning prior. When Caldwell took out a bank loan from the Citizens National Bank, he stated he was the sole owner. The bank advanced him $130,000. A director of the bank, Leslie Combs II, was also assured Jim French would stand at his Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, when his racing days were over. Citizens Bank during their course of investigation discovered that the horse's true owner was R. Robert LiButti (also known as Robert Presti). LiButti had been barred from racing in 1968. Stud record Having missed the Travers, Jim French was sold to art dealer Daniel Wildenstein for $1 million and retired to Haras de la Verrerie in France. Not proving successful at stud (although he sired Jimka, dam to Jim And Tonic, one of only ten horses ever selected for the French Horse Racing Hall of Fame), he then went to Japan in 1979.

The population of the Civil Parish at the 2011 census was 825. It is situated east from the centre of Rotherham and forms a continuous urban area with Maltby, separated from the rest of Rotherham by Junction 1 (Bramley Interchange) of the M18. It is situated by Hellaby Brook and, whilst signposted as \\"Hellaby Village\\", the parish has no school, church or post office. History The name Hellaby is formed from \\"Helgebi\\", the Domesday orthography by which Norman scribes attempted to express a sound. \\"Helgebi\\" was noted in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being within the Parish of Stainton and entrusted by Roger de Busli, who was instrumental in the founding of nearby Roche Abbey, whose foundations were laid in 1147. Although mentioned in the Domesday Book dated back nine hundred years, the ending of the name in \\"bi\\" would indicate a Scandinavian influence and settlement that would have been standing many years previous to this. \\"Bi\\" means farming land in old Norse, and so Helgebi referred to the farming land of Helge, a female name of Norse tradition. The Humber would have proved an ideal landing point with followers of the Vikings, \\"helgi\\" and \\"mault\\" (Maltby), sailing up the Rivers Trent and Idle and establishing themselves in the nearby limestone valleys with their clear waters and fertile soil. The \\"Helgebi\\" settlement would have been built around the nearby streams with land being used for cultivation, woodland and grazing and it is doubtful whether the combined population of the two settlements would have exceeded two hundred souls. Part of the present Hellaby Hall estate is listed with English Heritage as the deserted site of a Medieval village, with the remains of a well, square ditched enclosure, example of ridge and furrow ploughing method, post Medieval long house, corn drying oven and indications of metal working. Located between the highway and the hall, recent excavations revealed five plots and croft remains, which could have been used for domestic use with recovered pottery sherds identifying occupation between the 10th and 15th centuries. The crafts had been constructed of freestanding, limestone blocks, infilled with rubble. Desertion of the medieval village probably occurred in the 15th Century, though it is not known for what reason. Over two thousand abandoned villages had been recorded nationally during the 14th and 15th century with varied reasons for desertion, including economic viability, change in land use, population fluctuation or as a result of widespread epidemics such as the Black Death. (This particular epidemic accounted for the death of nearly 60% of the estimated population of the Deanery of Doncaster). As a consequence of their abandonment, many villages lay frequently undisturbed by later occupation and particularly small villages are not well represented in the archaeological record. The site here at Hellaby Hall is a rare example of such a village, which has been partially excavated and found to retain substantial remains relating to this class of listed site monument. Whilst surrounding settlements such as Maltby developed into a township, Hellaby remained a hamlet, entirely dependent on its one estate without either a church or a public house. Local entries noted that the original name of \\"Helgebi\\", which became Hellaby, had variations such as \\"helughby\\", and by 1379 the name along with its derivatives was spreading into neighbouring villages. In spite of this, by the time Parish Registers were introduced in 1538, the family name of Hellaby and all its variations had entirely died out. The last of the male line was William of Hellaby, described as a cattle dealer. The fact that he paid 12d, the maximum amount of tax due, indicated his wealth and standing in the community. It was his daughter, who as heiress to the estate married John Fretwell of Braithwell, in around 1530, during the time of Henry VIII and although the Hellaby family name ended, it survived as the name of the estate and the village. The daughter died around 1560 and the lands came into the Fretwell family. Although the Fretwell family owned the Hellaby Estate, they continued to live in the nearby village of Braithwell. The hearth tax returns of 1667 indicated that they occupied three houses in the locality. This included the vicarage at Stainton, the family home at Braithwell, which had four fireplaces and a dwelling at Hellaby with eight fireplaces. This was not the present Hall but an earlier building, probably of Tudor style and most likely built on the same site. The man responsible for the building of the Hellaby Hall was the Great, Great, Great grandson of John Fretwell, Ralph Fretwell who was baptised in Sheffield on 23 June 1631. Ralph Fretwell went to Barbados and started a sugar plantation. He became one of the pioneers who laid the foundation of British Trade and prosperity and by his industry he was granted an export licence by Charles II to export horses, bred on the Hellaby estate, to Barbados to turn the mills to crush the sugar cane and in return sugar was imported into the district through the Port of Hull. By 1700, exports from Barbados exceeded in value those of all North America together. He named the highest mount in Barbados, which happened to be on his estate, \\"Hillaby Mount\\". He is thought to have owned a large part of Philadelphia and he was appointed Chief Justice of Court Justice of Court of Common Pleas in Barbados. In 1671 he became a Quaker and in 1674 was removed from office because of his beliefs. Numerous prosecutions followed for allowing negroes to attend religious meetings in his house, for not paying church dues and for not carrying out Militia duties. Hellaby Hall, built in the late 17th century Ralph Fretwell returned to Hellaby around 1688 and commenced building of the present hall, farm and cottages. Completed in 1692, the Hall was designed in the Jacobean style. The doorway having an open segmental entablature on Tuscan Pilasters. Gables on each side with big, fleshy volutes rising in slopes and curves to a flat top. Three sides of the hall are built of coursed magnesium limestone from local quarries and the front, faced with Roche Ashlar. With a Dutch impression that was influenced by the style common in the colonies, the Hall was built on a hill and hence an extra storey was required to obtain the height at the front elevation. Ralph Fretwell did not get on well with his wife and so returned to Barbados after the Hall was finished in 1692 and died there in 1701. In the inventory of his goods at Hellaby (which accompany his will in archives at York) he left £5000 to each of his three daughters, as well as the Hellaby Estate. The younger daughter died before the age of eleven years, the youngest, Mabel, married Dr Samuel Swyfen of Lichfield in 1710. Swynfen was the godfather of Dr Samuel Johnson and Mabel eventually became the housekeeper of Dr Johnson. The eldest daughter, Dorothy married John Pyott, and it was to her that the estate and adjoining farmlands, descended. The daughter of Dorothy and John Pyott, also named Dorothy, married Peter Johnson, Recorder of York. They had one daughter only, named Dorothea, who became heir representative of the estate and when she married Sir John Eden of West Auckland, the Hellaby Estate came into the Eden family, the most prominent member of the family being Lord Avon, Sir Anthony Eden, former Prime Minister. The Eden family had no need of Hellaby Hall as their interests were in York. Much of the original staircase and oak panelling were removed and it became a farmhouse for various tenant farmers. For a while it was let to Samuel Clarke who was an active Methodist and the main introducer of Methodism into Maltby. =Morrell= Circa 1870–1918 The Hellaby Hall estate was sold by Sir William Eden to the Morrell family in 1870. Sir Anthony Eden, on his retirement, built a house on the Island of Barbados, only a few miles from where Ralph Fretwell's fortune had been made. The hall was again sold in 1918 to Cliff Carnelly. =Carnelly= Circa 1918–1994 Carnelly was the last resident of Hellaby Hall when he moved out in 1976 and a fire in July 1980 destroyed much of the original inside of the building. For many years it lay in dis – repair whilst the owners of the time and the council determined who should be responsible for the restoration of the hall. A local company finally purchased the estate and with the guidance of English Heritage went about restoring much of the original hall as well extending the facilities to become a hotel. It only opened for three months and stayed closed for nearly four years. On 14 August 1995 Tomorrows Leisure plc acquired Hellaby Hall. Hellaby Hall was expanded with modern buildings, and was reopened in 1995 as a hotel. On 23 December 2015 the hotel was acquired by AJL Hotel Holdings Ltd and is now a 4 star 89 bedroomed hotel with a pool spa and large gym. Community =Parish council= In 2011 Hellaby was split from Bramley to become a separate civil parish. A parish council was created with 5 councillors, and the first election was held on 5 May 2011. =Religion= Despite not having a parish church, Hellaby has the East Pennines Assembly hall, which serves the Jehovah's Witness community of the surrounding bay areas. =Hellaby Community Hall= There have been recent moves to sell the land where Hellaby local community hall (unused since 2007) is situated. After the 2007 closure a developer planned to demolish it. Applications for planning permission were made in 2008 and 2011. Local residents protested as it is the last of the local facilities in the village. Both applications were withdrawn. Centenary Hall is now reopened to the public following a period of repair. Sport A short lived greyhound racing track was opened south of where Cumwell Lane meets Bateman Road on 7 April 1928. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The outline of the track can still be seen from the air today, with many trees now occupying the centre of the track, despite the fact that it closed during the early 1930s.

The operation started in the 1930s, reached its peak in the 1960s, and was dismantled in the 1970s. It was responsible for providing the vast majority of the heroin used in the United States at the time. The operation was headed by Corsican criminals Paul Carbone (and his associate François Spirito) and Antoine Guérini, and also involved Auguste Ricord, Paul Mondoloni and Salvatore Greco. Most of the operation's starting capital came from assets that Ricord had stolen during World War II when he worked for Henri Lafont, one of the heads of the Carlingue (French Gestapo) during the German occupation in World War II. History =The 1930s, '40s, and '50s= Illegal heroin labs were first discovered near Marseille, France, in 1937. These labs were run by Corsican gang leader Paul Carbone. For years, the Corsican underworld had been involved in the manufacturing and trafficking of heroin, primarily to the United States.Time.com, Time, September 4, 1972 It was this heroin network that eventually became known as \\"the French Connection\\". The Corsican Gang was protected by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the SDECE after World War II in exchange for working to prevent French Communists from bringing the Old Port of Marseille under their control.Alfred W. McCoy, Cathleen B. Reach, and Leonard D. Adams, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (Harper & Row, 1972); Peter Dale Scott, The War Conspiracy (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972); Henrik Krueger, The Great Heroin Coup (South End, 1980); Leslie Cockburn, Out of Control (Atlantic Monthly, 1987). Carlo Cortes, AP, Manila, Oct. 25, 1989. Historically, the raw material for most of the heroin consumed in the United States came from Indochina, then Turkey. Turkish farmers were licensed to grow opium poppies for sale to legal drug companies, but many sold their excess to the underworld market, where it was manufactured into heroin and transported to the United States. The morphine paste was refined in Corsican laboratories in Marseille, one of the busiest ports in the western Mediterranean Sea. The Marseille heroin was reputed for its quality. Marseille served as a perfect shipping point for all types of illegal goods, including the excess opium that Turkish farmers cultivated for profit. The convenience of the port at Marseille and the frequent arrival of ships from opium-producing countries made it easy to smuggle the morphine base to Marseille from the Far East or the Near East. The French underground would then ship large quantities of heroin from Marseille to New York City. The first significant post-World War II seizure was made in New York on February 5, 1947, when seven pounds (3 kg) of heroin were seized from a Corsican sailor disembarking from a vessel that had just arrived from France. It soon became clear that the French underground was increasing not only its participation in the illegal trade of opium, but also its expertise and efficiency in heroin trafficking. On March 17, 1947, 28 pounds (13 kg) of heroin were found on the French liner St. Tropez. On January 7, 1949, more than 50 pounds (22.75 kg) of opium and heroin were seized on the French ship Batista. After Paul Carbone's death, the Guérini clan was the ruling dynasty of the Unione Corse and had systematically organized the smuggling of opium from Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries. The Guérini clan was led by Marseilles mob boss Antoine Guérini and his brothers, Barthelemy, Francois and Pascal. In October 1957, a meeting between Sicilian Mafia and American Mafia members was held at the Grand Hotel et des Palmes in Palermo to discuss the international illegal heroin trade in the French Connection.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, p. 44-45 =The 1960s= The first major French Connection case occurred in 1960. In June, an informant told a drug agent in Lebanon that Mauricio Rosal, the Guatemalan Ambassador to Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, was smuggling morphine base from Beirut, Lebanon to Marseille. Narcotics agents had been seizing about 200 pounds (90 kg) of heroin in a typical year, but intelligence showed that the Corsican traffickers were smuggling in 200 pounds (90 kg) every other week. Rosal alone, in one year, had used his diplomatic status to bring in about 440 pounds (200 kg). The Federal Bureau of Narcotics's 1960 annual report estimated that from 2,600 to 5,000 pounds (1,200 to 2,300 kg) of heroin were coming into the United States annually from France. The French traffickers continued to exploit the demand for their illegal product, and by 1969, they were supplying the United States with 80 percent of its heroin. On April 26, 1968, a record setting seizure was made, of heroin smuggled to New York concealed in a Citroën DS on the SS France (1960) ocean liner. The total amount smuggled during the many transatlantic voyages of just this one DS was according to arrested smuggler Jacques Bousquet. Because of this increasing volume, heroin became readily available throughout the United States. In an effort to limit the source, US officials went to Turkey to negotiate the phasing out of opium production. Initially, the Turkish government agreed to limit their opium production starting with the 1968 crop. At the end of the 1960s, after Robert Blemant's assassination by Antoine Guerini, a gang war sparked in Marseille, caused by competition over casino revenues. Blemant's associate, Marcel Francisci, continued the war over the next years. Jean Jehan Former New York City Police Department Narcotics Bureau detective Sonny Grosso has stated that the kingpin of the French Connection heroin ring during the 1950s into the 1960s was Corsican Jean Jehan. Although Jehan arranged the famous 1962 deal gone wrong of 64 pounds of \\"pure\\" heroin, he was never arrested for his involvement in international heroin smuggling. According to Grosso, all warrants for the arrest of Jehan were left open. For years thereafter, Jehan was reported to be seen arranging and operating drug activities at will throughout Europe. According to William Friedkin, director of the 1971 film The French Connection, Jehan had been a member of the French Resistance to Nazi Occupation during World War II and, because of that, French law enforcement officials refused to arrest him. Friedkin was told that Jehan died peacefully of old age at his home in Corsica. =The 1970s: Dismantling= Following five subsequent years of concessions, combined with international cooperation, the Turkish government finally agreed in 1971 to a complete ban on the growing of Turkish opium, effective June 29, 1971. During these protracted negotiations, law enforcement personnel went into action. One of the major roundups began on January 4, 1972, when agents from the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) and French authorities seized 110 pounds (50 kg) of heroin at the Paris airport. Subsequently, traffickers Jean-Baptiste Croce and Joseph Mari were arrested in Marseille. One such French seizure from the French Connection in 1973 netted 210 pounds (95 kg) of heroin worth $38 million. In February 1972, French traffickers offered a United States Army sergeant $96,000 () to smuggle 240 pounds (109 kg) of heroin into the United States. He informed his superior who in turn notified the BNDD. As a result of this investigation, five men in New York and two in Paris were arrested with 264 pounds (120 kg) of heroin, which had a street value of $50 million. In a 14-month period, starting in February 1972, six major illicit heroin laboratories were seized and dismantled in the suburbs of Marseille by French national narcotics police in collaboration with U.S. drug agents. On February 29, 1972, French authorities seized the shrimp boat, Caprice des Temps, as it put to sea near Marseille heading towards Miami. It was carrying 915 pounds (415 kg) of heroin. Drug arrests in France skyrocketed from 57 in 1970 to 3,016 in 1972. Also broken up as part of this investigation was the crew of Vincent Papa, whose members included Anthony Loria Sr. and Virgil Alessi. The well-organized gang was responsible for distributing close to a million dollars worth of heroin up and down the East Coast of the United States during the early 1970s, which in turn led to a major New York Police Department (NYPD) corruption scheme. The scope and depth of this scheme are still not known, but officials suspect it involved corrupt NYPD officers who allowed Papa, Alessi, and Loria access to the NYPD property/evidence storage room, where hundreds of kilograms of heroin lay seized from the now-infamous French Connection bust, and from which the men would help themselves and replace missing heroin with flour and cornstarch to avoid detection.Blumenthal, Ralph. \\"Mobster Makes Offer on French Connection Case\\", New York Times, February 21, 2009.Maitland, Leslie. Papa's Game, New York Times, September 6, 1981 The substitution was discovered only when officers noticed insects eating all the bags of \\"heroin\\". By that point an estimated street value of approximately $70 million worth of heroin had already been taken. The racket was brought to light and arrests were made. Certain plotters received jail sentences, including Papa, who was later murdered in federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia. Ultimately, the Guérini clan was exterminated during internecine wars within the French underworld. In 1971, Marcel Francisci was accused by police forces in the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics of being involved in the trafficking of heroin between Marseilles and New York City.Marcel Francisci Shot Dead; Tied to 'French Connection', UPI, January 16, 1982 On 16 January 1982, Marcel Francisci was shot to death as he was entering his car in the parking lot of the building where he lived in Paris, France.

In this unique bike event riders' times are reduced by five minutes for each doughnut they consume during two pit stops in the nearby towns. History The Tour de Donut was started in 1989 by a group of Southwestern Illinois cyclists who thought a race spoofing the Tour de France would be a natural. Members of the now defunct Mid-America Bicycle Club were discussing ideas for a unique ride, and the Tour de Donut was born. The Mid-America Bicycle Club folded in 1998 and former members sought a new sponsor. Since then, St. Louis’ Boeing Employees Bicycle Club has sponsored the event. The race is also sponsored by the Staunton Chamber of Commerce. Tours =Staunton, Illinois= The first race started in 1989 with approximately 25 riders. Over the years, the race has expanded in the route, race options and participating competitors. Digital tracking of race results started in 2011 through 2020 shows an overall increase of competitors averaging between 800-1,600 cyclists per year of competition. The introduction of a new, shorter \\"Donut Hole\\" route is intended for younger riders, or more inexperienced riders. Competitors are able to compete for places, but also distinct rewards for performance. After the race placement awards are presented by category for best Elapsed Time, Adjusted Time and Most Donuts Eaten. Door/Attendance prizes and grand prizes are also awarded. =Troy, Ohio= In September 2007 a Tour de Donut was started in Greenville, Ohio by Colavita Ohio Cycling club attracting just over 100 participants. In 2008 the event moved to Brumbaughs Fruit Farm in Arcanum and the donuts were made on site for the event and had 279 participants. 2009 had over 500 participants. The 2010 event had 603 finishers. The 2011 event had 920 participants. The 2012 event had 1354 participants. The event moved to Downtown Arcanum in 2012 with donuts being provided by Ulbrichs in Piqua Ohio. The 2013 event had over 1600 participants and offered a free kids race for the first time that had 70 kids racing in the enclosure in Downtown Arcanum. In 2014 1976 participants took part in the 16, 32 and new Double D 64 mile courses. 100 kids participated in the free kids races. 2015 and 2016 saw event caps of 2000 participants reached. In 2017 Tour de Donut Ohio moved to the City of Troy Ohio. Attracting 2400 participants the event continues to grow each year. Paired with Rock the Bike music festival the event drew thousands for live music, demonstrations, food and beer. The event is promoted by Extremity Sports club a division of the 501c3 not for profit Rocketship Sports Management. The annual event has grown into the largest ride one day ride in Ohio attracting all types of cyclist and fun seekers and is held the first Saturday after Labor Day. The 12th Tour de Donut is scheduled for Saturday August 24 in Troy Ohio. =Greenville, Michigan= The event has been held at the Klackle Orchards Family Fun Farm west of Greenville, Michigan since 2009. A 30-mile race where three minutes (not the traditional five minutes) are deducted from your actual time for each donut consumed. The 2010 event had 321 finishers. This event has not taken place since 2015 being cancelled the last two years due to low attendance. =American Fork, Utah= The event has been hosted by the Rotary Club of American Fork in American Fork, Utah since 2008. A 21-mile race where three minutes (not the traditional five minutes) are deducted from your actual time for each donut consumed. The 2010 event had 245 finishers. =Katy, Texas= In July 2004, Katy, Texas started making the Tour de Donut an annual event as well. Known as the \\"Sweetest Bike Ride in Texas\\", the 28 mile race benefits the Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Texas Gulf Coast. All profits from the event are donated to the foundation. The 2010 event had 209 finishers. =San Luis Obispo, California= Annual event that began in 2011. A 20-mile untimed ride visiting 3 donut shops and a 2-mile time trial with an elevation gain of about 800 ft (250 m). Riders have 10 minutes at each shop to consume donuts and each donut results in a deduction of 15 seconds from their time. Documentary film: Gluttons for Punishment A documentary film, \\"Tour de Donut: Gluttons for Punishment\\", was created by Steve Kelly and Jim Klenn. The film follows two elite cyclists along the tour as they try to help their friend \\"out pedal and out eat the rest of the competition.\\" The documentary features a brief history of the race and the filmmakers' biographies; it also offers visitors the chance to watch the film's trailer and purchase the film.

While the ruins of the site were still visible when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark ventured in the area during their famed 1804 westward expedition, all traces of the fort were eventually lost by the mid-19th century. Today, the exact location of the fort is a mystery. History =Active service= The fort named for Louisiana Governor Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, was the furthest west on the Missouri at the time. Its first commandant was François Coulon de Villiers who came from an illustrious New France military family. Like many frontier forts it doubled as a trading post operated by Joseph Athanase Trottier dit Desruisseaux (Joseph Deruisseau), who had a monopoly on trade on the Missouri from January 1, 1745 to May 20, 1750. Deruisseau chose the specific location of the fort because \\"the 'friendly Kansa[s] were a dependable source of high grade furs' and the location was strategic\\". According to the Kansas Historical Society, the fort was: :small but substantial ... with a surrounding stockade of stout piles and with bastions at each of the four stockade corners. Internal buildings included a commandant's house, a guardhouse, a powder house, a trader's house, and a house for the trader's employees. The buildings were constructed of logs and most were covered with mud. =Decline and abandonment= The fort felt into decline sometime after the French and Indian War (1754–1763). During this time, the area in which Fort de Cavagnial came under the power of Spain, although French soldiers remained at the site of the fort until 1764, when Pierre-Joseph Neyon de Villiers (acting on behalf of Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie, the director- general of the Colony of Louisiana) ordered that the troops stationed in the area to \\"throw down\\" the outpost and retreat to New Orleans. Evidently, the site was not completely razed, as in 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark stumbled across the old site during their westward expedition, noting in their journal that \\"[Fort de Cavagnial] may be recognised by some remains of chimneys, and the general outline of the fortification, as well as by the fine spring which supplied it with water.\\" In 1819, explorers on Stephen Harriman Long's Yellowstone expedition also made note of the ruin, describing them as \\"a few miles below Isle au Vache.\\" By the mid-19th century, all traces of the fort were gone. Location The exact location of the fort is not known because of conflicting reports about its relationship to trade with the Kansa tribe. British reports placed it below the confluence of the Kansas River and Missouri in what is today Kansas City. However, most reports place it on the bluffs above the confluence of Salt Creek and the Missouri River just north of modern-day Fort Leavenworth. This was roughly in the same location as a major Kansa village. Lewis and Clark reported visiting this site on July 2, 1804: :The French formerly had a fort at this place, to protect the trade of this nation, the Situation appears to be a verry elligible one for a Town, the valley rich & extensive, with a Small Brook Meanding through it and one part of the bank affording yet a good landing for boats. For decades, researchers, archaeologists, and scholars have \\"flown over [the area] in a helicopter, studied aerial photographs of it, driven around and over it, and walked over practically every square foot of it—and have found no definite trace of [the fort].\\" In 1987, the magazine Soldiers claimed that David L. Campbell, through the use of template mapping, had located foundations on a bluff that may have been the fort's remains. (This claim was reiterated in 2012 by The Leavenworth Times.) However, this claim has not been verified by archaeological evidence, and in 2004, the Kansas Historical Society claimed that the fort's exact location \\"remains as one of the active historical and archeological mysteries in Kansas.\\" See also *List of French forts in North America References External links *Geospectra photos Fort de Cavagnal Category:Forts in Missouri Category:Forts in Kansas Fort de Cavagnal Category:French forts in the United States Category:Colonial forts in Missouri Category:Colonial forts in Kansas Category:1744 establishments in the French colonial empire ","title":"Fort de Cavagnial"},{"id":"9796822","text":"Pohlsepia mazonensis is the earliest described octopod, originating from the late Carboniferous period. The species is known from a single exceptionally preserved fossil discovered in the Pennsylvanian Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation, north-east Illinois, United States. Pohlsepia mazonensis is named after its discoverer, James Pohl, and the type locality, Mazon Creek. Its habitat was the shallows seawards of a major river delta in what at that time was an inland ocean between the Midwest and the Appalachians. After discovering Pohlsepia mazonensis’ existence, Pohl increased the origin of octopuses back by 140 million years. This discovery was key as it revealed a soft-bodied octopod from the Upper Carboniferous period. The type specimen is reposited at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. Fossil The Pohlsepia mazonensis fossil found by James Pohl is the only known example of the species. Most notably, the fossil has ten arms. The extra two arms are shorter, while the other eight are similar in length.Kluessendorf J, Doyle P. 2000 Pohlsepia mazonensis, an early \\"Octopus\\" from the Carboniferous of Illinois, USA. Palaeontology 43(5): 919-926 The 2.5 cm long fossil is “sack-shaped” with indistinct features including a poorly defined head. While it is unclear, one of these features could be an ink sac. The fossil lacks arm hooks and suckers and all of these factors combine to make the assigning of the order Cirroctopoda controversial.Eyden, Phil. “Fossil Octopuses.” The Octopus News Magazine Online, Nov. 2004, www.tonmo.com/pages/fossil-octopuses/. James Pohl Fossil finder James Pohl discovered Pohlsepia mazonensis. He is the son of Joe Pohl and together they have collected fossils in the Mazon Creek area. Originally from Wisconsin and Minnesota, Pohl is a native Midwesterner. He and his father have donated their fossils to museums in the area, including Pohlsepia mazonensis to the Field Museum. Classification In 2000, Joanne Kluessendorf assigned Pohlsepia mazonensis to the order Cirroctopoda. Many other researchers disagreed, citing the lack of internal structure. The possible evidence of fins and the huge time difference between the Pohlsepia mazonensis fossil and first confirmed cirrate octopus fossils is problematic. However, the species can be classified as an octopod. Despite having ten arms, the fact that the fossil has an indistinct head, sac like body and similar fins to cirrate octopods gives enough evidence to classify Pohlsepia mazonensis in the order Cirroctopoda. When looking at the groups Teudopsidae, Trachyteuthididaee, the Vampyromorpha, cirrate octopods, incirrate octopods and the fossil Loligosepiina, Pohlsepia mazonensis would be most related to the octopods based on its lack of a shell. Mazon Creek Located in what is currently northern Illinois, the Mazon Creek preserved the Pohlsepia mazonensis fossil extraordinarily. The Pohlsepia mazonensis fossil was found specifically in the Francis Creek Shale Member and like most fossils found in Mazon Creek, is preserved as carbon film. The Francis Creek Shale Member of the Carbon Formation has a diverse array of preserved plants and animals.Baird, G. C., et al. “Taphonomy of Middle Pennsylvanian Mazon Creek Area Fossil Localities, Northeast Illinois: Significance of Exceptional Fossil Preservation in Syngenetic Concretions.” PALAIOS, vol. 1, no. 3, 1986, pp. 271–285. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3514690. These organisms were immediately buried due to bursts of water and their remains were protected before most decomposition could start. In storm surges organisms would be submerged in sediments, creating an environment where their fossils were extremely well protected.  Field Museum of Natural History The Pohlsepia mazonensis fossil is currently located at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. Located eighty miles from the fossil's discovery, the museum is one of the largest natural history museums in the world. It also houses similar fossils in the Mazon Creek Fossil Invertebrates Exhibit. These fossils include spoon worms, ribbon worms, bristle worms, millipedes, and cockroaches. There are also some preserved fossils of crustaceans and cephalopods. Like 'Pohlsepia', there are multiple mollusca fossils, including bivalves and cephalopds. The closest fossils to 'Pohlsepia' are the cephalopods 'Wiedeyoceras' and 'Bactrites' dating around 305 million years old.“Mazon Creek Fossil Invertebrates.” The Field Museum, 2 Oct. 2014, www.fieldmuseum.org/science/blog/mazon-creek- fossil-invertebrates.

The title is a tribute to Albert Langer,. an Australian political activist, who advocated for the use of this style as a de facto method of optional preferential voting for making a valid vote for the voter's preferred candidates while the deliberate \\"error\\" avoided the vote being counted for one of the major political parties. Voters were advised to mark 1, 2, . .n, for favoured candidates, but to mark a repetition of the next digit against each of the remaining candidates. For example, a vote would be marked 1, 2, 3, 3, 3. The votes for the first and second candidates would be counted but the remaining candidates would then not receive preferences. From 1983 this was a valid vote, however since 1998 the Electoral Act requires that there be no repeated numbers. History Preferential voting was introduced in Federal elections in 1918. sections 123 and 124. While voting was voluntary at the time, a valid vote was required to express a preference for every candidate, described as full preferential voting,. and a failure to mark ballots in consecutive numerical order meant that the vote was informal. This was confirmed by the High Court in a case concerning the 1928 election. This was a half senate election in which 3 senators were to be elected for Victoria. 6 candidates were nominated, however Maj Gen John Forsyth died before the ballot. Most ballot papers were reprinted with just the 5 remaining candidates. The Labor how-to-vote card had Forsyth listed as #5 and more than 11,000 ballots had numbered the candidates 1, 2, 3, 4 & 6\\\\. Starke J noted that the Electoral Act required that a ballot paper being given effect according to the voter's intention so far as his intention is clear and accepted that in this case the voters preferences were clear. Despite this however Starke J held that the Electoral Act \\"absolutely and imperatively\\" required that a voter use consecutive numbers so that the votes were properly rejected as informal. In 1983 the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform was concerned at the informality rate for Senate voting. The Electoral Act was amended so that while a voter was formally required to express a preference for all candidates, a vote that erroneously did not comply with this requirement was saved from being rejected as informal.. Subsection 270(1) applied to the Senate and subsection 270(2) to the House of Representatives.The terms of s 270(2) & (3) at that time are set out in the judgment of Brennan CJ in at pp 313-4. =1987 election= In 1987 Harold Van Moorst and Langer were part of \\"The Coalition Against Poverty and Unemployment\\" and were urging people to either (1) not vote at the election on 11 July 1987 (2) to deliberately vote informally or (3) informing electors of the effect of section 270 of the Electoral Act, set out in a document headed \\"How not to give preferences\\" so that electors could avoid voting for the major parties. The Australian Electoral Commission applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for an order preventing Van Moorst from encouraging people not to vote. Langer was added as a defendant at his own request. Murphy J granted the injunction until the defendants could put on evidence and the matter could be heard.Australian Electoral Commission v Van Moorst & Langer [1987 VicSC 257] (26 June 1987). After hearing the evidence on 2 July, Vincent J held that it was an offence not to vote and an offence to incite people not to vote. Vincent J also held it was an offence to use a representation of a ballot paper to vote other than in accordance with the directions on the ballot paper and granted injunctions to prevent Van Moorst or Langer distributing documents to that effect. Van Moorst and Langer did have some measure of success however in that Vincent J held that it was not an offence to vote informally, nor to inform voters as to the effect of s 270 of the Electoral Act, holding that . > The system of compulsory voting requires that electors record votes at each > election. It is, of course, integral to the operation of that system that > all electors make choices. It is not integral that they must choose between > the candidates or that, contrary to the dictates of their consciences, they > must vote for persons who they may regard as being totally unacceptable to > fill the offices for which they present themselves. ... That choice in my > view does permit them to say in effect \\"A plague on all their > houses\\".Australian Electoral Commission v Van Moorst & Langer [1987 VicSC > 270] (2 July 1987). Van Moorst and Langer sought a declaration that (1) electors were entitled to deliberately vote informally and (2) electors were entitled to make a Langer vote. They also sought orders requiring the Australian Electoral Commission to publicise these declarations. Murray J declined to make either of the declarations, holding they merely sought to repeat the effect of the judgement of Vincent J and that they had no standing to seek an order requiring the Australian Electoral Commission to publish them.Australian Electoral Commission v Van Moorst & Langer [1987 VicSC 278] (6 July 1987). The extent of Langer votes and the legislative response The campaign was not effective in 1987, with just 2,082 exhausted votes being recorded. For the 1990 election however this jumped to 18,765 exhausted votes. Following the 1990 election the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral matters recommended that it be made an offence to encourage others to vote other than in accordance with full preferential voting. The Electoral Act was again amended to include s 329A which provided as follows: > 329A. (1) A person must not, during the relevant period in relation to a > House of Representatives election under this Act, print, publish or > distribute, or cause, permit or authorise to be printed, published or > distributed, any matter or thing with the intention of encouraging persons > voting at the election to fill in a ballot paper otherwise than in > accordance with section 240. Penalty: Imprisonment for 6 months.Commonwealth > Electoral Act 1918 s 329A as at 15 June 1995. The purpose of s 270 was said to be that voters \\"do not have their votes discarded because of an unintentional mistake\\", but that s 329A was necessary to ensure that \\"people do not go out and intentionally frustrate the will of this Parliament by advocating an optional preferential system\\". For the 1993 election the number of exhausted votes dropped back to 7,325. Langer's challenge In the week before the 1993 election Langer sought a declaration from the High Court that s 329A was not a valid act of the Commonwealth. On 11 March 1993 Deane J refused to make the declaration sought and referred the matter for consideration by the Full Court. The matter was not heard until 4 October 1995,. and the order was handed down on 7 February 1996, one month prior to the 1996 election while the reasons for judgement were not handed down until 20 February 1996. =Arguments= Langer represented himself and argued that arguments were that (1) the wording of section 240 did not require consecutive numbers without repeats, (2) the langer voter was a valid method of voting (3) this impacted on free and fair elections in that it was an attempt to prevent discussion of a method of casting a valid vote and (4) the AEC was intimidating and misleading people about how they could vote. The Commonwealth was represented by the Solicitor-General, Griffith , and argued that s 240 required full preferential voting and that s 270 was a savings provision that was intended to apply to unintentional errors. S329A was necessary to protect the integrity of compulsory preferential voting. =Judgement= All of the Court held that a Langer vote was a valid vote under the then electoral laws. The majority, Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ, upheld the validity of s329A. Brennan CJ \\"What the Constitution requires is that the law prescribe a method of voting which leaves the voter free to make a choice, not that the law leave the voter free to choose the method of voting by which a voter's choice is to be made. A method which requires full preferential voting satisfies the constitutional requirement.\\" Similarly Toohey and Gaudron JJ held that s 328A assisted in the maintenance of a system of full preferential voting and was confined to conduct that was intended to encourage non-compliance with s 240 and was not concerned with conduct that was intended only to inform. Each of McHugh J, and Gummow J, held that the purpose of s 329A was to prevent the full preference system of voting from being undermined. Dawson J dissented on the basis that the constitutional power of the Parliament to make laws about elections for the House of Representatives arose from sections 31 and 51(xxxvi) of the Constitution,State election laws applied until \\"the Parliament otherwise provides\\", pursuant to the and the parliament has power to make laws about any such matter:(xxxvi). which meant the law needed to be for the purpose of electing members of parliament, who must be \\"directly chosen by the people.. The purpose of s 329A was not incidental to the election of representatives but rather to prevent the dissemination of information about how a person could cast a vote in a particular - and permissible - form. The prosecution of Langer The High Court upheld the validity of s329A on Friday 2 February 1996. On Monday 5 February 1996 the Australian Electoral Commission commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria, seeking an order to prevent Langer from breaching s329A. This was not a prosecution for a breach of s329A, but instead it was an order to prevent a breach under s383.. Beach J found that Langer had published material with the intention of encouraging people to fill in their ballot papers otherwise than in accordance with s240 of the Electoral Act and granted an order to prevent him from continuing to do so.Australian Electoral Commission v Langer [1996 VicRP 42] [1996] 1 VR 576. Langer made it clear to the Court that he did not intend to comply with the order and immediately proceeded outside the court where he distributed leaflets contrary to the Court order. On 14 February 1996, Beach J found that Langer was in contempt of court and would continue to breach the order unless he was prevented from doing so. Beach J sentenced Langer to be imprisoned until 30 April 1996.. =Federal Court Appeals= Langer appealed to the Federal Court challenging the order of the Supreme Court. Langer argued that s240 did not require elector write numbers consecutively and he was therefore not advocating a breach of s240. A Full Court of the Federal Court, Black CJ, Lockhart & Beaumont JJ dismissed his appeal against the order. Langer also appealed against his conviction for contempt and the appeal was heard by the same full court. Langer submitted that > ...it would be very desirable for you to let me go at once. I have achieved > my objectives. There is no further useful purpose that you can serve on my > behalf by continuing to make a complete mockery of the judicial system and > the electoral system in this country, and I have better things to do.\\" The Electoral Commission submitted that its interests were not served by the imprisonment of Langer after the date of the election on 2 March 1996. Black CJ, Lockhart & Beaumont JJ held that the finding that Langer intended to breach the order was fully justified and upheld his conviction for contempt. The Court held however that the term of imprisonment was too long and ordered his release on 7 March 1996. Subsequent events The number of exhausted votes in the 1996 increased spectacularly from 7,325 in 1993 to 48,979 in 1996. Amnesty International described Langer as Australia's first prisoner of conscience for over 20 years, alleging that his imprisonment was a breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. During the campaign John Howard described s329A as stupid. In 1998 section 329A was repealed and the Parliament attempted to make the Langer voting method invalid by amendments to the Electoral Act.. A Langer vote is now classed as an informal or invalid vote. > The treatment of ‘Langer-style’ votes changed in 1998. Langer-style ballots > are typically numbered so that, at a point chosen by the elector, the > preferences stop or begin to repeat (for example, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3. . .). > Before 1998, such ballots were counted up to the point that the numbering > stopped or became non-consecutive, and were then classified as exhausted. > Until 1993, the number of Langer-style votes was small, but in 1996 there > was a considerable increase.

Since legislative change in > 1998, Langer-style votes have been counted as informal, and their number has > declined considerably. It was not until 2016 that the Parliament permitted optional preferential voting for the Senate. Full preferential voting is still required for the House of Representatives.

Childhood  Bickmore was born in the town of St. George near Martinsville harbor, Maine, on March 1, 1839. He attributes his childhood lived on the beach and near a forest to his love of nature and vocation as a naturalist.Bickmore, Albert S. An Autobiography with a Historical Sketch of the Founding and Early Development of the American Museum of Natural History, 1908, unpublished manuscript. As a child, he collected shells and sea urchins, learned the names of the local flora and fauna, and skated on a nearby pond on winter evenings. According to Bickmore, the church and the school were the centers of the community of St. George. Books were scarce, however, and in his earliest childhood, he remembered being permitted to hold in his hands \\"Goldsmith's Natural History, Abridged,\\" which he treasured like a sacred relic. He loved to look at its crude illustrations of animals and to memorize them. At age 8, he spent a year travelling in France with his parents and sister.  Education  He later attended prep school in New London, New Hampshire, then went on to Dartmouth College, where his favorite subjects were chemistry, geology, and mineralogy. His love of natural history was noted by the Dartmouth faculty, who gave him a letter of introduction to study under the well-known Harvard professor Louis Agassiz. After graduating with the class of 1860, he went on to become one of Agassiz's handful of special students. He also worked in Agassiz's Museum of Comparative Zoology, which helped him pay his way through a four-year course of study. It was during this time that Bickmore began to visualize founding a Museum of Natural History in New York City, as the European museums of natural history were in political and monetary capitals, and New York was a logical American parallel city. When the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII) visited Cambridge MA in 1861, Henry Acland of the University of Oxford joined him. Bickmore was privileged to discuss his plans for a museum with Dr. Acland, whose encouragement strengthened his determination to found such a museum. Others had previously failed to generate the necessary funds to establish a museum.  Civil War military service  In late 1862, Bickmore joined the 44th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers, under Col. Francis L. Lee. The Regiment was sent to Newbern, NC, in October 1862 to serve under Major General John G. Foster. They encountered the Confederate Army at Whitehall in December 1862, sustaining heavy casualties, but Bickmore remained unharmed. Bickmore then requested to keep the meteorological record at a hospital near Cape Lookout. He then traveled home to resume his studies at Harvard.  Book written  Albert S. Bickmore wrote a book titled: \\"Travels in the East Indian Archipelago\\", published in 1868. The preface begins by saying; \\"The object of my voyage to Amboina was simply to re-collect the shells figured in Rumphius's \\"Rari-teit Kamer,\\" and the idea of writing a volume of travels was not seriously entertained until I arrived at Batavia, and, instead of being forbidden by the Dutch Government to proceed to the Spice Islands, as some of my warmest friends feared, I was honored by His Excellency, the Governor- General of \\"the Netherlands India,\\"...\\" His expedition in the East Indian Archipelago covered April 1865 to May 1866. He arrived at Batavia on 30 April 1865 on the Memnon a Sear's clipper ship, Captain Freeman, out of Boston.

The adopted son of Takeda Nobukata, shugo (Governor) of Wakasa Province, he was later re-adopted by Kakizaki Sueshige. Some sources say he was originally of the Minabe clan. Life Nobuhiro was born in Aoi castle in Obama, the capital of Wakasa province, and was called Hikotarō as a child. Though he was the older child, he was passed over as his father's heir for his younger brother Takeda Kuninobu, who had already himself produced a son. Nobuhiro was said to have been adopted, not a true blood relative, and became estranged from the family. At the age of 21, he escaped Wakasa in the middle of the night, along with Takeda vassals Sasaki Shigetsuna, Kudō Sukenaga and three others. They made their way towards the shogunal residence, but found that Minabe Mitsumasa had left. Moving to the territory of the Kakizaki clan, Nobuhiro adopted their surname as his own. A few years later, in 1454, he followed Andō Masasue to Hokkaidō (then called Ezo), and settled in the town of Kaminokuni. There, he came to be adopted by Kakizaki Sueshige, who named Nobuhiro his heir. Two years later, he sired a son named Kakizaki Mitsuhiro. One of largest Ainu revolts in history, Koshamain's Revolt, occurred the following year, in 1457. Koshamain led a group of Ainu in a surprise attack on the samurai town, and Nobuhiro led a fierce counterattack along with Kakizaki Sueshige. The tide of battle turned a few times, but the samurai won in the end. Thus, Nobuhiro became one of the more famous and celebrated heroes in the Japanese history of Hokkaidō. He built Katsuyama castle in 1462, and began to receive tribute from the Ainu of Sakhalin in 1475, though there was no possibility of the small number of samurai present effectively extending their control that far. Nobuhiro died at the age of 64, in 1494. His descendants would continue to defend Japanese settlements in Hokkaidō from the natives. Around the year 1600, the family name was changed to Matsumae, and as the lords of Matsumae Domain, they headed shogunal relations with (and defense against) the Ainu until the late 19th century. Hokkaidō was officially annexed following the Meiji Restoration. A few years later, when railroads began to be spread across the island, one of the first locomotives was named Nobuhiro after him.

With two or more projectors a system of front-surface mirrors that can pop-up are used in a multiplexer. These mirrors switch different projectors into the camera lens. The camera could be fed live to air for broadcasting through a vision mixer or recorded to a VTR for post-production or later broadcast. In most TV use this has been replaced by a telecine. Projectors The projectors often are: 16 mm film movie projector, a 35 mm slide projector and a 35 mm film movie projector. In low-end use the motion picture 35 mm projector would be replaced by a second 16 mm projector or 8 mm film, or Super 8 mm film or Single-8 projector. The multiplexer with the camera and projectors surrounding it would often be called a film island. The optical or mag or magnetic strip soundtrack on the motion picture would be picked up by the projector and would be fed to an audio sound mixing console or to the VTR. (See: Sound-on-film, Film sound, and 35 mm sound.) The slide projector at a TV station would be used for the TV station's logo, the famous \\"Please Stand By\\" slide and some test patterns. Some used a dual-rotating drum slide projector that would have its own mirrors to switch between the drums. The film projectors used in a film chain are not standard. A special five-blade shutter is used to convert the film's 24 frames per second into NTSC's 30 frame per second video. If this was not used, the video would have major flicker problems. This process is called a \\"3:2\\" pull down. Modern telecines use the same process, but it is done electronically, not with a five-blade shutter. \\"3:2\\" pull down means that a film frame is shown for three TV fields. The next film frame is shown for two TV fields. The add field in the \\"3\\" is used to convert the 24 frames per second to 30 frames per second. A normal projector has a two-bladed shutter that shows the same frame twice. Before modern continuous motion telecines, film chains were sometime referred to as telecines. All film projectors use sprocket rollers to move the film and a pull-down claws to move and stop the film in the gate. The film is moved in the gate while the shutter blocks the light. In PAL, SECAM, and other 25 frames per second systems, the film projector speed is increased one frame per second to 25 frame/s. This gives a one-to-one film to video frame transfer ratio. Thus a standard two-bladed shutter can be used. See frame rate differences for more information. The camera A film chain usually used a video camera tube as this reduced flicker. Vidicon image pick up tubes were the preferred pick up for film chains as these gave the least amount of flicker. When charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras were introduced these were also used in a film chain. CCD cameras often gave a sharper picture, but with more flicker. Early film chains had black and white (B&W;) cameras and many were later replaced with color. The camera could be a standard professional video camera, but most often was a camera designed for the purpose of film transfer. Originally only print positive film was used. Later cameras that could invert and color correct color negative film were used. Professional video cameras made for film chains were used for broadcast use. A scene-by-scene color correction option was later added to film chains. This was first done by notching the edge of the film where a color change was wanted. Later, machines that counted the sprocket holes were used. At the mark (the notch or the electronic sprocket- count number) the next stored color correction would occur. See color grading for more information. Products *RCA was by far the largest maker of film chains for broadcast with the monochrome TK-21 and the color TK-26, TK-27, TK-28, and TK-29 film pickup cameras. : Its broadcast division also designed and built 16mm projectors for television use, including the TP-6, that was often used with a TP-15 Multiplexer. Early 16mm installations tended to be RCA TP-16 or Eastman 250. : A different RCA division developed 35mm projectors for television use, culminating in the 35mm FR-35 and a not so well regarded 16mm FR-16 projectors. Early 35mm installations tended to be RCA TP-35. : RCA's TP-66, which debuted in the early 1960s, was widely used in stations and networks for 16mm silent, optical, and magnetic sound film playback, both live on air and to videotape for editing or delayed broadcast. It is still used by a number of home movie transfer outfits due to its generally low cost of acquisition, and that it was designed to run 24/7 playing back without problems the film content that made up much television programming in television's first 30 years. : RCA's final film pickup camera, the TK-29, came in three models, A, B and C. The \\"A\\" was a basic model, \\"B\\" added more control and options. The TK-29C was RCA's \\"teleproduction\\" version, and could be equipped with \\"ChromaComp\\", an early form of color correction hardware. : For transfer of high-end television commercials to videotape, TK-29Cs were equipped by some post-production houses with various forms of triggering the color correction settings in sync with film movement. Punched paper tape was one of the methods used to record the settings, much like film color timing systems of that era. : As television program suppliers moved to videotape and then satellite distribution, prints of theatrical films and programs were transferred to videotape, often from separate 35mm picture and sound elements. Sacramento independent television station KRBK (31) kept its film islands and 1\\" recorders busy transferring Hollywood-created material for syndication. One of the two islands that had a TK-29C, FR-35, and an electronic pitch shifter to restore the natural pitch of the sound when films and shows were speeded up to gain more commercial time. Episodes of Little House on the Prairie were transferred at KRBK, and are still being fed to stations for airing. * General Electric also made film chains, both in B&W; and color; among its color film cameras were the PE-24 and PE-240, both of which used four vidicon tubes (designated as \\"4-V\\"). GE film chains were also prevalent in many television stations; one of its largest clients was ABC. CBS also used GE film pickup cameras. * Eastman Kodak made several well regarded 16mm projectors for television use. * TeleMation Inc. made B&W; and color film chains like the TMM-203 Multiplexer and TMU-100 Uniplexers. TeleMation cameras and later film chain camera racks were used for the pick up. These often used Bell & Howell projectors, like the B&H; 379\\\\. Bell & Howell later purchased Telemation. Fotomat used a fleet of TeleMation units for 16mm, 8mm, and S8mm transfers to VHS. * Bosch Fernseh made a number of color and B&W; film chains for many years, such as the OMY Color Film Chain;Deutsches Fernsehmuseum Wiesbaden OMY, Film Chain, German site color film chain with a KCU-40 camera,oldtvgear.com Color film chain, with Bosch Fernseh KCU-40 camera as PU B&W; film chain in 1968.radiomuseum.org Fernseh Filmgeber Telecine 1968 * A number of manufacturers made small home film transfer systems. The introduction of the Rank Cintel Mark III flying spot scanner and Bosch Fernseh FDL60, called a telecines, paved the way to shift from projector-based transfer to a gentler system, continuous transport motion, that allowed the easy transfer of negative film and print film and thus the decline of film chains. Film slides were replaced by 2D computer graphics devices.

She is best known as the long-time lesbian partner of Marguerite Radclyffe Hall, author of The Well of Loneliness. Una Troubridge was an educated woman with achievements in her own right. Most notably she was a successful translator and introduced the French writer Colette to English readers. Her talent as a sculptor prompted Nijinsky to sit for her several times.Troubridge's bust of Nijinsky , peopleplayuk.org.uk; accessed 9 April 2014. Early life Born Margot Elena Gertrude Taylor, she was nicknamed Una by her family as a child and chose the middle name Vincenzo herself, after her Florentine relatives. She was raised in Montpelier Square, in London's Knightsbridge district, and became a pupil at the Royal College of Art, and after she graduated set up a sculpture studio. Her father died in 1907, leaving her with limited financial support, and marriage became her best practical option. She married Captain Ernest Troubridge in October 1908; they had one daughter, Andrea.Admiral Ernest Troubridge profile, runctonweb.co.uk; accessed 9 April 2014. Ernest Troubridge rose to the rank of admiral during and immediately after the First World War, and Una gained her title when Admiral Troubridge was knighted in June 1919, although they were already legally separated at the time. She was a devoted admirer of the Italian-Russian operatic bass Nicola Rossi-Lemeni [1920-1991], and followed his career all over the world. She later became a close friend of both Rossi-Lemeni and his wife, the soprano Virginia Zeani, and was godmother to their young son. Relationship with Radclyffe Hall Hall and Troubridge met in 1915 as Troubridge's cousin, singer Mabel Batten (aka Ladye), was Hall's lover at the time. Batten died in 1916, and Hall and Troubridge moved in together the following year. In the early 1920s, Troubridge and Hall's home was at 10 Stirling Street, London, near where Troubridge had grown up. The property was extensively renovated by the two.Stirling Street history, british-history.ac.uk; accessed 9 April 2014. She wrote about the intensity of their relationship in her diary: \\"I could not, having come to know her, imagine life without her.\\"Notes from the Butch-Femme Portal , butch-femme.com; accessed 9 April 2014.Femme Magazine article, stonefemme.com; accessed 9 April 2014. In an effort to ease the great sense of guilt about Mabel's death Hall and Troubridge became interested in spiritualism. They regularly held seances with the use of a medium and believed that they received advice from Mabel, from beyond the grave.Radclyffe Hall: Biography from Answers.com Both Troubridge and Hall identified as \\"inverts\\",, stonefemme.com; accessed 9 April 2014. a term used by sexologists such as Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis usually to connote what is regarded as homosexuality. The couple raised and showed dachshunds and griffons. The dachshunds shown in Romaine Brooks' portrait of Troubridge were a prize-winning pair given to her by Hall.Romaine Brooks's portrait of Troubridge, americanart.si.edu; accessed 9 April 2014. In the last nine years of her life Hall had become obsessed with a White Russian nurse, Evgenia Souline, a relationship which caused Troubridge unhappiness, but which she nonetheless tolerated. Initially the women had decided to move to Italy and live in Florence, but were forced to return at the outbreak of WWII. The three chose to live in Devon. After Radclyffe Hall's death Despite all their troubles, Troubridge stayed with Hall and nursed her until she died in 1943. In the early 1920s Troubridge adopted a tailored style similar to Hall's own masculine look, as a way of making her sexual identity and their partnership visible. Later she came to prefer more feminine dress that complemented Hall's.Cline, 151. After Hall died of bowel cancer in 1943, Troubridge had Hall's suits altered to fit her and wore them habitually.Souhami, 394. On her deathbed, Hall revoked a previous will that had provided Souline with an income, and instead left everything to Troubridge, including the copyrights to her works. In her new will she asked Troubridge to \\"make such provision for our friend Eugenie Souline as in her absolute discretion she may consider right\\"; Troubridge provided Souline with only a small allowance. She burned Souline's letters. In her 1945 biography, The Life and Death of Radclyffe Hall, she minimized Souline's role in Hall's life. Souline died in 1958. Troubridge died in Rome in 1963; she had left written instructions that her coffin be placed in the vault in Highgate Cemetery where Hall and Batten had been buried, but the instructions were discovered too late.Cline, 372-375. She is buried in the Campo Verano Cemetery in Rome, and on her coffin is inscribed \\"Una Vincenzo Troubridge, the friend of Radclyffe Hall\\".

Trobaugh received his BFA in 1996 with honors from University of Alabama at Birmingham and went on to study photography at the School of Visual Arts. In 2003 he received his Masters in Fine Art from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. His photography has been published in Art Papers, selected as the cover artist. He has also been published in The Chronicle of Higher Education, NY Arts Magazine, The Washington Post and The Advocate as well as The Birmingham News and World of Wonder, among many others. While teaching at Sheldon State in Tuscaloosa Alabama, Trobaugh's work was censored before a planned exhibition. The case has yet to be resolved but gained national attention due to censorship issues. He was forbidden to discuss this censorship as part of his art appreciation class. Trobaugh later resigned his post. Richard Meyer, Chair of the Art Department at The University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California, spoke about Trobaugh's work at various national conferences about censorship.

A version of the group, emphasising comedy routines as well as music, continues to perform to the present day. History The Rockin' Berries were originally formed as a beat group at Turves Green School in Birmingham in the late 1950s by guitarist Brian \\"Chuck\\" Botfield, and were so named because they played several Chuck Berry songs in their set. An early keyboard player with the group was Christine Perfect, later Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. When another band was formed locally, by singer Paul Hewitt, guitarist Doug Thompson and drummer Terry Bond, Botfield agreed to join on condition that it used the \\"Rockin' Berries\\" name. By mid 1961, the group comprised Botfield (lead guitar), Doug Thompson (rhythm guitar), Tim Munns (bass), Dennis Ryland (saxophone), Terry Bond (drums), and singers Paul Hewitt and Jimmy Powell. Later that year, the group went to Germany to play a series of club engagements, with Hewitt being replaced by singer and Elvis Presley impressionist Clive Lea. On their return, the group auditioned for promoter Jack Good, who wanted to sign Powell but not the rest of the group. After a few months, Powell left for a solo career, later leading the Five Dimensions who for a while included Rod Stewart. Thompson, Ryland and shortly afterwards Munns also left, and were replaced by singer and guitarist Geoff Turton—an old friend of Botfield's—and bassist Roy Austin. When the group returned to England, they won a contract with Decca Records, who released their first two singles, \\"Wah Wah Woo\\" and \\"Itty Bitty Pieces\\" in 1963. Although the group appeared on TV show Ready Steady Go!, the records were not hits, and the group, now managed by John Schroeder, signed a deal with Pye Records subsidiary Piccadilly. Their first record for the new label, \\"I Didn't Mean To Hurt You\\", reached No. 43 on the UK singles chart, and the band appeared at the Marquee Club in London where they were seen by American record producer Kim Fowley. He suggested they record a version of \\"He's in Town\\", a Goffin and King song that had been a US hit for The Tokens. The Rockin' Berries' version reached No. 3 in the UK in late 1964, and the follow- up records, \\"What In The World’s Come Over You\\" (No. 23) and \\"Poor Man’s Son\\" (No. 5) were also hits. They also released a successful album, In Town. At this point, Roy Austin left the group and was replaced by Bobby Thomson, previously of Rory Storm & The Hurricanes. According to Richie Unterberger at Allmusic: > \\"Much of the Berries' output reflected the lighter pop/rock face of the > British beat boom, emphasizing catchy, carefully constructed tunes supplied > by British and American songwriters, with high harmonies indebted to the > Four Seasons and the Beach Boys.... A career strategy that put an eye on the > \\"all-around entertainer\\" niche, however, led them to record many comedy > numbers that have dated excruciatingly badly, and also ensured that they > were denied artistic credibility.\\" The commercial fortunes of the group declined thereafter, although \\"You're My Girl\\" (1965) and \\"The Water Is Over My Head\\" (1966) were minor chart hits. They regularly featured Clive Lea's impersonations and group comedy routines, remained a popular live act on the cabaret circuit, and appeared at the 1967 Royal Variety Performance. Geoff Turton left the group in 1968, and had a briefly successful solo career as Jefferson, with two Billboard Hot 100 hits in the US in 1969–70.

From 1986 to 1989 he worked as a member of noise rock group Lubricated Goat and appeared on their album, Paddock of Love. He was a member of Bloodloss (1993–97), a blues-punk band, alongside Mark Arm on vocals. From 2001 Maddison is the bass guitarist of the United States-based grunge band, Mudhoney (which includes Arm), and has worked on their studio albums, Since We've Become Translucent (2002), Under a Billion Suns (2006), The Lucky Ones (2008), Vanishing Point (2013), and Digital Garbage (2018). Early years Guy Bernard Maddison was born on 31 March 1965 and grew up in Perth, Western Australia. 1980s Guy Maddison played in mid-1980s Perth-based punk group, Greenhouse Effect, with Paul Gill on guitar. By 1986 he moved to Sydney, he played bass guitar for noise rock band Lubricated Goat, sometimes under the pseudonym Buster Smallgoods, recording one album, Paddock of Love (July 1988). In 2003 Maddison recalled meeting Stu Spasm (aka Stuart Grey) by chance, \\"I was crossing the road one day on Cleveland Street ... and Stuart yelled out to me ... he asked me if I was doing anything and if I’d like to play the bass in Lubricated Goat\\" – they had previously met when Spasm was recording tracks in Perth with an earlier version of Lubricated Goat. The line-up of Lubricated Goat for Paddock of Love, alongside Maddison on bass guitar, and Spasm on vocals, guitar, synthesiser and bass guitar; were Pete Hartley on bass guitar and guitar; and Brett Ford on drums. In November 1988 the band lip-synched a nude performance of their track, \\"In the Raw\\", on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV program Blah Blah Blah, an event which created national media outrage. In 2009 Cousin Creep, an alternative music journalist, directed a documentary film, In the Raw, about the event. In May 1989 Lubricated Goat followed with an extended play, Schadenfreude with Maddison and Spasm joined by Gene Ravet on drums (ex-Ragadoll, Space Juniors) and Charlie Tolnay on guitar (Grong Grong, King Snake Roost). Front man Spasm and Maddison were the only band members to tour the United States, they enlisted tour musicians, Renestair EJ on guitar and Martin Bland on drums. Maddison was an occasional member of the improvised group, The Unconscious Collective, and the mixed media experiment, Merge. In late 1989, after the US tour, Maddison left Lubricated Goat and formed a side project with former bandmate, Hartley. The new group was Monroe’s Fur. At this time, Maddison relocated to Seattle, Washington. 1990s In 1990 Guy Maddison was briefly a member of a studio group, Bushpig, on bass guitar and keyboards, with Tolnay (ex-Bloodloss) and Peter Hill (King Snake Roost) on vocals and harmonica. That year they issued a self-titled album on Hill's label, Practical Goat Keeping Records. In 1993, Maddison played bass guitar in the third incarnation of Bloodloss, a blues- punk band which had started in Adelaide, Australia in 1982. This version had formed in Seattle with Mark Arm (Mudhoney) on vocals, and Maddison's former bandmates Renestair and Bland. In November 1995 the group issued Live My Way on Warner / Reprise Records. Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, felt they \\"played delta blues by way of Captain Beefheart and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion\\". On 1 January 1996, Bloodloss issued their next album, Misty. McFarlane found it showed \\"echoes of Pere Ubu, Thug and all manner of jazz and blues\\". 2000s In 2001, after the departure of founding Mudhoney bass guitarist, Matt Lukin, Maddison joined the US alternative rock band alongside former bandmate, Arm. He has appeared on their studio albums, Since We've Become Translucent (2002), Under a Billion Suns (2006) and The Lucky Ones (2008). In November 2011 Arm credited Maddison with reinvigorating his interest in the group after Lukin had left.

Ricks. Fiasco deals with the history of the Iraq War from the planning phase to combat operations to 2006 and argues that the war was badly planned and executed. Ricks based the book in part on interviews with military personnel involved in the planning and execution of the war. In 2009, Ricks published a sequel The Gamble: General David Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2006-2008. Fiasco was a finalist for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. Summary The book alleges that the planning of the Iraq war was mismanaged by both the Bush administration as well as the U.S. Army. Ricks then goes on to outline the infighting between the senior policy advisers such as Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and the Army. Ricks includes quotes from former generals of the Iraq war, former Army generals, and several top level officials, both working for the Bush administration and Douglas Feith's planning contingent. Moving into the war, Ricks alleges various miscommunication and mismanagement of the Army's combat tactics as well as criticizing the overall strategy. Ricks also heavily criticizes the actions of L. Paul Bremer and explores his impact as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority.

It was first produced at the Actors Theatre of Louisville as part of the 2000 Humana Festival of New American Plays. It was later filmed by Richard Linklater as Tape starring Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman. It follows classical unities of action, time and space, featuring three characters in a single plot regarding their differing perspectives of past events, in one unbroken period of real-time, in a single motel room set. Synopsis Tape is set in a motel room in Lansing, Michigan. Vince, an outgoing drug dealer/volunteer firefighter, is in town to support his old high school friend's entry into the Lansing film festival. His friend, documentary filmmaker Jon Saltzman, joins Vince in his motel room and the two begin to reminisce about their high school years. They get on the subject of Amy Randall, Vince's former girlfriend. It appears that whilst they dated for some time, Vince and Amy never had sex. However, after their relationship had ended, Amy had slept with Jon. Naturally, Vince was hurt even though he and Amy had broken up some time previously. Vince claims Amy had told him that Jon had date raped her. Vince becomes obsessed with, and eventually succeeds in getting a verbal confession from Jon about the alleged rape. Immediately after Jon's admission, Vince pulls out a hidden tape recorder that had been recording their whole conversation, much to Jon's horror. Vince then tells Jon that he has invited Amy to dinner, and that she will be arriving shortly. Eventually Amy does arrive and even though all three of them feel awkward, they begin to talk. Amy explains that she is now an Assistant District Attorney in the Lansing Justice Department. Eventually the three discuss what actually happened between Jon and Amy that night at the party. Amy claims that it was merely rough sex and that Jon did not rape her, leading Jon to believe that she is in denial. After Jon becomes annoyed that Amy is refusing to accept his apology, Amy makes a call with her cell phone to the local police. She asks for a squad car to pick up one person in possession of drugs (Vince), and one in relation to a verifiable rape (Jon). After concluding her phone call, Amy warns the men that they only have about four minutes to make a run for it. In order to prove to Amy that he is truly remorseful, Jon decides to stay and wait for the police. Vince, realizing that there is nowhere for him to run, flushes his narcotics down the toilet. Amy reveals that she didn't really call the police, and leaves.

Edges may either meet at a common endpoint, or, if they have no endpoints in common, at a point in their interiors. In the latter case, the crossing must be transverse.. A preliminary version of these results was reviewed in . Linear thrackles A linear thrackle is a thrackle drawn in such a way that its edges are straight line segments. Every linear thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices, a fact that was observed by Paul Erdős. Erdős observed that, if a vertex v is connected to three or more edges vw, vx, and vy in a linear thrackle, then at least one of those edges lies on a line that separates two other edges; without loss of generality assume that vw is such an edge, with x and y lying in opposite closed halfspaces bounded by line vw. Then, w must have degree one, because no other edge than vw can touch both vx and vy. Removing w from the thrackle produces a smaller thrackle, without changing the difference between the numbers of edges and vertices. On the other hand, if every vertex has at most two neighbors, then by the handshaking lemma the number of edges is at most the number of vertices.. Based on Erdős' proof, one can infer that every linear thrackle is a pseudoforest. Every cycle of odd length may be arranged to form a linear thrackle, but this is not possible for an even- length cycle, because if one edge of the cycle is chosen arbitrarily then the other cycle vertices must lie alternatingly on opposite sides of the line through this edge. Micha Perles provided another simple proof that linear thrackles have at most n edges, based on the fact that in a linear thrackle every edge has an endpoint at which the edges span an angle of at most 180°, and for which it is the most clockwise edge within this span. For, if not, there would be two edges, incident to opposite endpoints of the edge and lying on opposite sides of the line through the edge, which could not cross each other. But each vertex can only have this property with respect to a single edge, so the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices. As Erdős also observed, the set of pairs of points realizing the diameter of a point set must form a linear thrackle: no two diameters can be disjoint from each other, because if they were then their four endpoints would have a pair at farther distance apart than the two disjoint edges. For this reason, every set of n points in the plane can have at most n diametral pairs, answering a question posed in 1934 by Heinz Hopf and Erika Pannwitz.. Andrew Vázsonyi conjectured bounds on the number of diameter pairs in higher dimensions, generalizing this problem. In computational geometry, the method of rotating calipers can be used to form a linear thrackle from any set of points in convex position, by connecting pairs of points that support parallel lines tangent to the convex hull of the points. This graph contains as a subgraph the thrackle of diameter pairs.For the fact that the rotating caliper graph contains all diameter pairs, see . For the fact that the diameter pairs form a thrackle, see, e.g., . An enumeration of linear thrackles may be used to solve the biggest little polygon problem, of finding an n-gon with maximum area relative to its diameter.. Thrackle conjecture A thrackle embedding of a 6-cycle graph. John H. Conway conjectured that, in any thrackle, the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices. Conway himself used the terminology paths and spots (for edges and vertices respectively), so Conway's thrackle conjecture was originally stated in the form every thrackle has at least as many spots as paths. Conway offered a $1000 prize for proving or disproving this conjecture, as part of a set of prize problems also including Conway's 99-graph problem, the minimum spacing of Danzer sets, and the winner of Sylver coinage after the move 16. Equivalently, the thrackle conjecture may be stated as every thrackle is a pseudoforest. More specifically, if the thrackle conjecture is true, the thrackles may be exactly characterized by a result of Woodall: they are the pseudoforests in which there is no cycle of length four and at most one odd cycle.. It has been proven that every cycle graph other than C4 has a thrackle embedding, which shows that the conjecture is sharp. That is, there are thrackles having the same number of spots as paths. At the other extreme, the worst-case scenario is that the number of spots is twice the number of paths; this is also attainable. The thrackle conjecture is known to be true for thrackles drawn in such a way that every edge is an x-monotone curve, crossed at most once by every vertical line.. Known bounds proved that every bipartite thrackle is a planar graph, although not drawn in a planar way. As a consequence, they show that every thrackleable graph with n vertices has at most 2n − 3 edges. Since then, this bound has been improved several times. First, it was improved to 3(n − 1)/2,. and another improvement led to a bound of roughly 1.428n.. Moreover, the method used to prove the latter result yields for any ε > 0 a finite algorithm that either improves the bound to (1 + ε)n or disproves the conjecture. The current record is due to , who proved a bound of 1.3984n.. If the conjecture is false, a minimal counterexample would have the form of two even cycles sharing a vertex. Therefore, to prove the conjecture, it would suffice to prove that graphs of this type cannot be drawn as thrackles.

Early life  Yidnekatchew was born in Jimma to father Negadras Tessema Eshete and mother Mulatwa Gebreselassie. Yidnekatchew's father was serving his fifth year of exile from the country for being the Minister of Telegraph and Posts of the deposed Iyasu V of Ethiopia. This never really affected the relationship between Yidnekatchew and Emperor Haile Selassie, the two are seen in many shots where Yidnekatchew humbly accepted another trophy from the emperor. At age four, Yidnekatchew was sent to Teferi Mekonnen School, where he would receive most of his education. At school, the young Yidnekatchew played many sports but mastered football. At age 8 he was even made captain of his school team. In his teens, he also practiced cycling, short-distance running and boxing, but he always seemed destined for football, which led him to being recruited by a member of the Arada FC (now Saint-George SA). The young Yidnekatchew took French, English and Italian classes and was fluent in all those languages besides Amharic.  Later  He played for his school for five years, for the first Ethiopian soccer team, the St. George Club for 27 years. He played 27 times in international competitions representing his country. During the racially segregated footballing of the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, Yidnekachew translated the rules of soccer into Amharic language for the Native Sports Office. The year following the end of the occupation, Yidnekachew led the establishment of an official sports federation. He is considered as one of the country's biggest sporting heroes. He played and coached Ethiopian clubs and teams and founded the modern Ethiopian Sports office at age 22. As a player, he spent his entire career at Saint-George SA in Addis Ababa, joining the youth team in 1935 at age 14. Wearing the V across his chest he played 23 years straight with them including his youth years, a country record. Another record he holds is scoring 43 of 47 goals scored by his team in one competition season. When the Ethiopia national football team started playing international football in 1947, he was already 28 years old and the squad was vying for younger players, nevertheless he would get 15 caps to his name. His first cap was 1 May 1947 in a 5–0 victory over French Somaliland. His record for the country led him to coach the Ethiopia national football team, after his retirement as player for a glorious period, and in 1962, at age 41 when the African Cup of Nations was to be held in Ethiopia, he led them to their only championships in this respected tournament, beating Egypt 4–2 in the final. Ethiopian football was at its peak then, as Haile Selassie the emperor of Ethiopia awarded them the trophy. Yidnekachew was instrumental in founding member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in the late 1950s. He served CAF as the deputy president between 1964 and 1972 and as the President between 1972 and 1987. He was also member of the African Sport Congress, International Olympics Committee, FIFA and President of the African Olympics Committee. He would lead many Ethiopian sports delegations, including Ethiopia's Olympic teams to Rome 1960, to Tokyo 1964 and to Mexico 1968. Summer Olympics. He was the leader of the struggle that expelled apartheid South Africa from African Football in 1960, from the Olympics in 1971 and from FIFA in 1976. Controversy after death  In January 2006, 19 years after Yidnekatchew's death, Koraonline, the official football magazine of Egypt 2006 criticised Yidnekatchew of being a dictator in charge of African sport. The article stated: \\"Yidnekatchew Tessema was elected in Cameroon 1972, to rule African Football with an iron hand for 15 years.\\" Further, on Egypt's 2006 official site, instead of Yidnekatchew, they recorded that a Serbian coach by the name of Milosevic was the winning coach for Ethiopia instead of Yidnekatchew.http://www.egypt2006.com/estat.asp However, in team photos and clippings from that tournament, there is no sight of any European or foreigner among the Ethiopian players, and Yidnekatchew (who appears in many of the clippings himself) wearing a medal from that tournament. Legacy Yidnekatchew died 18 August 1987 at the age of 65 due to long-term illness. Until his death, he was the President of the Confederation of African Football, President of the Union of African Sports Confederations, honorary President of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa, Member of the Executive Committee of the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa and member of the International Olympic Committee. Africa saw him as an ambassador of Africa who took pride in athletic advancements made by the continent, and in March 1988, he was made Posthumous Honorary President of the African Football Confederation.

November, 2014.: Web. 28th November, 2014.http://www.eti.kit.edu/english/1376.php Other pioneers in the field of electricity include Hippolyte Pixii who built an alternating current generator in 1832, and William Ritchie's construction of an electromagnetic generator with four rotor coils, a commutator and brushes, also in 1832. Development quickly included more useful applications such as Moritz Hermann Jacobi's motor that could lift 10 to 12 pounds with a speed of one foot per second, about 15 watts of mechanical power in 1834. In 1835, Francis Watkins describes an electrical \\"toy\\" he created; he is generally regarded as one of the first to understand the interchangeability of motor and generator. Type and construction of rotors Induction (asynchronous) motors, generators and alternators (synchronous) have an electromagnetic system consisting of a stator and rotor. There are two designs for the rotor in an induction motor: squirrel cage and wound. In generators and alternators, the rotor designs are salient pole or cylindrical. =Squirrel-cage rotor= The squirrel-cage rotor consists of laminated steel in the core with evenly spaced bars of copper or aluminum placed axially around the periphery, permanently shorted at the ends by the end rings.Parekh, Rakesh. 2003. AC Induction Fundamentals 30 November 2014 Web. 29 November 2014.http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00887a.pdf This simple and rugged construction makes it the favorite for most applications. The assembly has a twist: the bars are slanted, or skewed, to reduce magnetic hum and slot harmonics and to reduce the tendency of locking. Housed in the stator, the rotor and stator teeth can lock when they are in equal number and the magnets position themselves equally apart, opposing rotation in both directions.Parekh, Rakesh. 2003.

Web. 25 Nov. 2014 The magnetic component of the rotor is made from steel laminations to aid stamping conductor slots to specific shapes and sizes. As currents travel through the wire coil a magnetic field is created around the core, which is referred to as field current. The field current strength controls the power level of the magnetic field. Direct current (DC) drives the field current in one direction, and is delivered to the wire coil by a set of brushes and slip rings. Like any magnet, the magnetic field produced has a north and a south pole. The normal clockwise direction of the motor that the rotor is powering can be manipulated by using the magnets and magnetic fields installed in the design of the rotor, allowing the motor to run in reverse or counterclockwise. Characteristics of rotors * Squirrel-cage rotor :This rotor rotates at a speed less than the stator rotating magnetic field or synchronous speed. :Rotor slip provides necessary induction of rotor currents for motor torque, which is in proportion to slip. :When rotor speed increases, the slip decreases. :Increasing the slip increases induced motor current, which in turn increases rotor current, resulting in a higher torque for increase load demands. * Wound rotor :This rotor operates at constant speed and has lower starting current :External resistance added to rotor circuit, increases starting torque :Motor running efficiency improves as external resistance is reduced when motor speed up. :Higher torque and speed control * Salient pole rotor :This rotor operates at a speed below 1500 rpm (revolutions per minute) and 40% of its rated torque without excitation :It has a large diameter and short axial length :Air gap is non uniform :Rotor has low mechanical strength * Cylindrical rotor :The rotor operates at speed between 1500-3000 rpm :It has strong mechanical strength :Air gap is uniform :Its diameter is small and has a large axial length and requires a higher torque than salient pole rotor Rotor equations =Rotor bar voltage= The rotating magnetic field induces a voltage in the rotor bars as it passes over them.

Pereira worked hard to dispel medieval concepts of medicine and proposed the application of empirical methods; as for his philosophy, it is of the standard direction and his reasonings are a clear precedent of René Descartes. He was the first to propose the famous \\"Cogito ergo sum\\", in 1554, commonly attributed to Descartes. He was famous for his practice of medicine, although he had many diverse occupations, such as owning businesses, engineering, and philosophy.  Biography  Not much is known of his life, because there was no one who took care of his manuscripts. What is known is the result of the investigation of unrelated documents to which researchers have given shape, many of them having to do with business or lawsuits. Notary document of 1567 with Pereira's signature Born in 1500 in Medina del Campo, he was the second of five brothers; his father, Antonia Pereira, owned a small shop of \\" xerguería,\\" i.e., fabrics and low quality cloths. His mother, Margarita de Medina, died in 1515 and her sons went to the care of her aunt Ana de Avila. It is thought that Pereira descended from a family of converted Jews originally from Portugal, though this is not certain because the source of this was a neighbor that testified against him in a lawsuit. However, we cannot rule out this conversion because we know that, until his marriage, Pereira lived with his parents on Serrano street, which is located in the old Jewish quarter of town. Pereira studied natural philosophy at the University of Salamanca with professor Juan Martínez Silíceo (who later became the archbishop of Toledo between 1545 and 1557). There, apparently, he was actively involved in the disputes between the realists and the nominalists, preferring the latter and rejecting the authority of the old masters in favor of knowledge provided by experience and reason. Here, he also studied medicine, concluding his studies 1520. He then returned to Medina where he established himself as a doctor. He married Isabel Rodriguez and lived on Rúa Nueva (now Padilla Street) where he worked as a doctor and managed the business that he inherited from his family. He possessed a considerable amount of capital and invested in a wide range of business including responsibility for making the actual income and managing the collection of several parishes, trading and warehousing wines, and renting rooms to other merchants who went to the \\"Great Exhibitions of the Kingdom\\" that took place in Medina. His fame as a physician exceeded the boundaries of Medina, and he practiced in Burgos, Segovia, Ávila and other important cities of Castille. He even came to the court of Phillip II where he was summed to attend upon Prince Charles, heir to the unfortunate throne, who had suffered a serious accident. Thanks to Pereira, the Prince lived until 1568. He was also interested in the construction of hydraulic devices and, with his companion Francisco Lobato, designed a watermill dam that could function without water, which was patented in 1563. In folio 26 of the Manuscripts of Francisco Lobato, the Medinan engineer decided to design a special mill, at the initiative of King Maxmilian II of Austria, who at the time was in Vallodolid (ca. 1550), a refugee from the wars against the Protestants. The future king of Bohemia took a fancy to go up the Douro River, so he commanded a galley be built and ordered the removal of any building that disrupted his navigation, i.e., fisheries and mills. This greatly harmed the locals who came to Lobato and Pereira to design a mill that could grind with the force of water without being directly on the river bank. Lobato goes on to explain that a model they tested on the Zapardiel River \\"milled and shook with reasonable force…, but it sucked in so much water that, by midday, there wasn't a single drop.\\" Although the model was refined with a dam that returned the water to the river, the king paid no attention, and the project fell into oblivion. Lobato complained bitterly that, despite the promises of funding by the Habsburgs, \\"we have already spent 150 ducats…and he never paid me anything—someday I'll have to ask for it.\\" Siphoning mill of Francisco Lobato and Gómez Pereira Pereira's unique thought arose from his synthesis of philosophy and medicine. He rejected the authority of the old masters and medievals in favor of reason, logic and experience. Moreover, he often used paradoxes and syllogisms to expose the errors of those he questioned. Thus, it can be argued that his philosophy was more negative than positive, but this is understandable considering the context of ideological suppression in the face of religious authority, as well the veiled accusations about Pereira's Jewish origins. The famous essayist Menéndez Pelayo wrote of this famous thinker: > In experimental psychology, Gómez Pereira is, without a doubt, more advanced > than his time, more than the seventeenth century, more than Bacon, more than > Descartes. None noted the phenomenon of his intelligence. =Novae veraeque Medicinae= Novae veraeque Medicinae is a medical treatise that focuses on the study of fevers [its causes and types] as well as other specific diseases like leprosy and smallpox. In this work, which he dedicated to Prince Don Carlos, Pereira challenges the tradition of Aristotle and Galen, as well as the medieval tradition of \\"magister dixit\\". His is an entirely empirical and rational method, based in his experience as a physician. The healing methods are simple, and the doctor, because of his method and experience, is the final criterion of truth (as opposed to truths of religion or faith). \\"In no case of religious things will I give the opinion and sentence of some philosopher if it is not based on reason.\\" Gómez Pereira felt that the heat generated by a fever is the body's defense mechanism to remove the damage that affects it and, thus, nature restores the natural balance of any body, a surprisingly modern conception of fever as a reaction against disease. As for his studies of diseases such as leprosy or smallpox, Pereira's conclusions were later commended by the physician and historian Antonio Hernández Morejón. =Antoniana Margarita= Antoniana Margarita Antoniana Margarita was reprinted many times but only very recently translated into Spanish (2000, from the original Latin).English translation, Gomez Pereira's Antoniana margarita : a work on natural philosophy, medicine and theology, by José Manuel García Valverde, Peter Maxwell-Stuart, Leiden ; Boston : Brill, 2019. . The work is dedicated to his teacher Juan Martínez Siliceo and is a tribute to his parents, Antonio and Margarita, even though the subtitle of clearly indicates its scientific and philosophical contents: \\"a work so useful and necessary for medical, physical, and theologians (\\"Opus nempe phisicis, ac medicis teologis, non minus utile quam necessarium\\"). A difficult text to read because there are no chapters or paragraphs, the document uses the language of the \\"christianos nuevos\\" (New Christians) to explore new ideas from empiricism and materialism, possibly an effort to hide potentially controversial and blasphemous methods of reasoning (16th Century Castile, the Council of Trent had already begun). Thus, the Pereira did not venture to develop the logical conclusions to their fullest extent. It is a philosophical treatise that addresses three key issues: the \\"automatism of beasts\\"; the theory of human knowledge; the immortality of the soul. The insensibility of animals Pereira's paradigm is typical of the Christian humanism of the Renaissance, denying that animals are equal to humans, while acknowledging some resemblance. Both have a body with five senses, but in the case of animals, the senses do not lead to knowledge, but cause automatic reactions. Indeed, many animals are capable of acting on internal impulses (soma), upon external stimuli (specie and phantasma), and have some non-conscious ability to learn (memoria). Nevertheless, Pereira denies animals the capacity for real knowledge: \\"bruta sensu carent.\\" The idea had many supporters, because, as indicated by the author himself, if animals feel just like humans, there would be nothing to differentiate, and if humans and animals are equal, animals can also learn about the Universal, which would be \\"absurd and impious.\\" But he also had detractors, some of them very close. The physician Francisco de Sosa, who published in 1556 his work \\"Endecálago against Antoniana Margarita, in which is treated many and very sensitive reasons and authorities of the proofs of the feeling and movement of brutes.\\" Human knowledge In this sense, Pereira's ideas are radically opposed to medieval scholasticism. He argues that knowledge enters through the sensory organs, as in animals, but only the human soul, its spirit, is capable of converting the information provided by the senses into real thought. This is one of the qualities of the soul, the ability to extract from physical sensations the substance of things (universals) through this process of abstraction. But Gómez Pereira believes that sensation and intellect go together in such a way that in human beings there is something that identifies the faculty of feeling with the quality of thought, in the same way, e.g., that thought and language are linked: \\"if you feel, you understand.\\" The immortality of the soul Thus, knowledge would be an essential faculty of the soul, and, moreover, the human being has a soul conscious of itself, that exists thanks to the thoughts it develops. In this work (Antoniana Margarita), there is the phrase \\"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\\" (\\"Nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum\\").Gómez Pereira, Antoniana Margarita: \\"De Immortalitate Animae\\", 1749 [1554], p. 277.Santos López, Modesto (1986). \\"Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense\\". In: Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión, ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986. History has not recognized his contribution even though Descartes had already been accused of plagiarism in his time, for example by Pierre Daniel Huet.Pierre Daniel Huet, Censura philosophiae Cartesianae. París: D. Horthemels, 1689. Although Pereira recognizes that animals have souls, it dies with them. The human soul, however, is self-sufficient and thus immortal. He provides three proofs that he claims had not been discovered. First, because of its consciousness, the human soul is capable of knowing independent of the body, and thus is capable of existing despite the body's death. Secondly, the human soul does not change even though the body ages or becomes diseased, that is, its essence is not affected by extrinsic factors. Thirdly, it is the desire of all humans to attain happiness, which, alongside the wish to know the future and the consequences of our actions, are the reasons that prompt us to do good, because evil deeds lead to punishment and misfortune.  Pereira and Descartes  After René Descartes published his Discourse on Method in 1637, the originality of the thoughts was questioned and even said to be an overt plagiarism of Gómez Pereira, as the Spanish philosopher had been studied by many prestigious intellectuals during the 16th and 17th Centuries. The first to suggest the similarities between the two was Pierre Daniel Huet, originally a follower then an opponent of Cartesian philosophy. Descartes himself was forced to defend himself against these accusations, as is evidenced by a letter he wrote in 1641 to his friend Father Marin Mersenne: > I have not seen Antoniana Margarita, nor do I have a great need to see it > any more than the Theses of Louvain or the book of Hansenius, but I would > like to know where to find a copy if you think it necessary. Many scholars of the 17th and 18th Centuries sided with Descartes and despised the work of Pereira, among them Pierre Bayle (although he did recognize the similarity between the two) and the Enclyopedists Diderot and d'Alembert who said: > Descartes is the first philosopher who dared to consider animals as mere > machines: therefore, Gómez Pereira, who said this some time before him . . . > stumbled upon this hypothesis by chance. However, many others have defended the contrary thesis. Even accepting that Descartes may not have read the work of Pereira, they argue that he was influenced indirectly, especially through the work of another Spanish physician and philosopher, Francisco Valles, who read it in French. Among those who accuse Descartes of being a counterfeit are Isaac Cardoso and Voltaire. The basis for this criticism is the striking similarities between the two thinkers on some key points: # The empirical method: Descartes' is a priori and deductive, whereas Pereira's is a posteriori and inductive. #Souls of animals: for both, it is a material soul, limited and mortal #The \\"automatism of beasts\\": whereas Descartes says that animals have a body, mind and memory, Pereira says the same using different language, viz., animals have internal structure or soma, external stimuli or phantasmae, and the ability to learn or memoria. #The basic syllogism is strikingly similar in both, the \\"Cogito ergo sum\\" (\\"je pense, donc je suis\\") of Descartes versus the \\"quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum\\" of Pereira (which precedes Descartes by some one hundred years).

A natural spring is located beneath the formations and has a high mineral concentration. There are two springs: Đavolja voda (Devil's Water), with extremely acidic water (pH 1.5) and high mineral concentration (15 g/l of water), and Crveno vrelo (Red Well). The unusually pungent spring waters were examined for the first time in 1905 by Aleksandar Zega, founder of the Serbian Chemical Society.  Protection  The formations were scientifically examined and described in 1955 by Tomislav Rakićević. Since 1959, Đavolja Varoš has been protected by the state and a 1995 decision of the Serbian Government declared it a major natural monument subject to category one protection.About Devil's Town, Official website It is visited by 50,000 tourists yearly.

Establishment PBIF was established in 2003 under the auspices of the Pacific Science Association. Preliminary discussions to create the forum began in 2001 at the third Global Biodiversity Information Facility meeting and an initial planning session convened in 2002. In 2004, a workshop took place to 1) further refine the PBIF concept as a vehicle for collaboration and innovation; 2) explore ways to make biodiversity data more fully available to the Pacific Basin and rim nations; and 3) to identify potential pilot projects that would further biodiversity efforts in the Pacific. The workshop attendees, Asia/Oceania-based governmental, intergovernmental, and non- governmental organizations, embraced PBIF as a vehicle to provide access to credible scientific information that is both easy to find and targeted to specific needs of the people in the region. Activities Whereas many current regional informatics initiatives focus much of their attention on information management of non-living resources, PBIF invests wholly in the information management of Pacific island organisms. PBIF is designed to aggregate, organize, and disseminate available biodiversity data in an electronically accessible information system. The PBIF effort is not intended to replace any existing activity, but to complement, link and strengthen current regional activities. Mission statement The Pacific Biodiversity Information Forum seeks to develop a complete, scientifically sound, and electronically accessible Pacific biological knowledge base and make it widely available to local, national, regional and global users for decision-making.

The institution is legally bound by the decision of Edinburgh European Council of 11 and 12 December 1992 and Article 341 of the TFEU to meet there twelve times a year for a session, each of which usually takes about four days. The majority of work, however, takes place in Brussels, and some other work is undertaken in Luxembourg City (see Location of European Union institutions for more information). Also all votes of the European Parliament must take place in Strasbourg. \\"Additional\\" sessions and committees take place in Brussels. Although de facto a majority of the Parliament's work is now geared to its Brussels site, it is legally bound to keep Strasbourg as its official home; a situation which garners much criticism from the European Parliament itself, as well as many interest groups, administrative staff, and environmentalist groups amongst others. The Parliament's five buildings, all named after distinguished European politicians, are located in the Quartier Européen (European Quarter) of the city, which it shares with other European organisations which are separate from the European Union's. Previously the Parliament used to share the same assembly room as the Council of Europe. Today, the principal building is the Louise Weiss building, inaugurated in 1999. Principal building The Louise Weiss building (IPE 4) (named after Louise Weiss, a French former member of the parliament), is located in the Wacken district of Strasbourg, south of Schiltigheim, between the 1920s workers' suburban colony (Cité ouvrière) Cité Ungemach and the 1950s buildings of the Strasbourg fair, some of which had to be torn down to make way for the Immeuble du Parlement européen 4, its formal name. Built at a cost of 3.1 billion French francs (470 million euros) at the intersection of the Ill and the Marne-Rhine Canal, it houses the hemicycle for plenary sessions, the largest of any European institution (750 seats – expanded to 785 – for MEPs and 680 for visitors), 18 other assembly rooms as well as a total of 1,133 parliamentary offices. Through a covered footbridge over the Ill, the Louise Weiss communicates with the Winston Churchill and Salvador de Madariaga buildings. With its surface of 220,000m² and its distinctive 60m tower,Figures about the building it is one of the biggest and most visible buildings of Strasbourg. The Louise Weiss was designed by the Paris-based team of architects Architecture-Studio. The architects were inspired by Roman amphitheatres. After the project was approved at an international contest in 1991, work, commissioned by the Société d'Aménagement et d'Équipement de la Région de Strasbourg on behalf of the Urban Community of Strasbourg, started in May 1995, with up to twelve tower cranes at the time on what was one of the biggest building sites of the decade in Europe. The inauguration of the building took place on 14 December 1999 by French President Jacques Chirac and Parliament President Nicole Fontaine. In internal EP documents, the building is referred to as \\"LOW\\". =Tower= The 60m high tower, intentionally left unfinished on one side, carries heavy symbolism, and is often said to have been oriented eastwards, i.e. towards eastern Europe, as by the time of the completion of the building no country from the former Soviet bloc had yet joined the EU. However, the open side of the tower actually faces west. In 2010 Glenn Beck suggested that the tower's design consciously mirrors the Vienna painting of the Tower of Babel by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.\\"Glenn Beck: Lessons From the Tower of Babel\\" (transcript), foxnews.com, 17 November 2010 = Agora = On 14 January 2009, the European Parliament decided to bestow the name of Bronisław Geremek, a recently deceased member from Poland, on the courtyard inside the tower,\\"La cour Geremek\\", relatio-euope.eu, 14 January 2009 calling it the \\"Bronisław Geremek Agora\\" (). This was officially inaugurated on 21 April 2009. Since 2004, the center of the Agora is marked with a glass sculpture \\"United Earth\\" by artist Tomasz Urbanowicz, which refers to the notion of openness and further expansion of the European Union. The glass artifact was approved by the Architecture-Studio and officially handed over as a gift from the City of Wrocław in the presence of the Josep Borrell, then President of the European Parliament. =Hemicycle= Members sit in a hemicycle according to their political groups arranged mainly from left to right, although with the non-attached members towards the back and right of the chamber. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for interpretation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining segment of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Behind them there is an EU flag attached to the wall with national flags in rows each side of it. Interpretation booths are located behind them and along the sides of the chamber, while public galleries are located above the chamber around the entire perimeter. Further benches are provided between the sides of the raised area and the MEPs; these are taken up by the council on the far left and the commission on the far right. The chamber as a whole is of a modern design, with the walls entirely composed of lights with large blue chairs for MEPs. Ceiling collapse On 7 August 2008, 10% of the ceiling of the plenary chamber collapsed. No one was injured, as Parliament was not meeting at the time (it was in summer recess), though a number of seats were damaged. A first part of the ceiling collapsed at 18.00 CET followed by a second part at 22.36 CET.Mahony, Honor (12 August 2008) European Parliament ceiling collapses, EUobserver No extreme weather conditions were reported and the structure was new, so it was assumed that the false ceiling had a defect.Lasry, Benjamin (13 August 2008) European parliament roof in Strasbourg collapses , Cafe Babel The President's office stated that a third of the ceiling had been affected and that \\"The preliminary results have revealed that the partial collapse of the ceiling resulted from the breakage of parts holding the suspended ceiling that connects it with the actual structure of the ceiling.\\" Repair work began immediately, but it became apparent that it could not be repaired in time for the next sitting. Thus, the session starting on 1 September was moved to the Brussels hemicycle. Parliament was expected to move back to Strasbourg for the session starting on 22 SeptemberMahony, Honor (22 August 2008) MEPs shift to Brussels after ceiling collapse, EUobserver but had to remain in Brussels for that session as well as safety inspections dragged on.Runner, Phillipa (4 September 2008) MEPs shift to Brussels after ceiling collapse, EUobserver The event was greeted with joy by those who oppose the Parliament's presence in Strasbourg, and mocked by eurosceptics who wore hard hats to the first plenary in Brussels after the incident (if Parliament had been sitting at the time, the collapsing ceiling would have hit members of the eurosceptic parties). In August 2012, the Paul-Henri Spaak building in Brussels which houses the hemicycle was found to be defective as well. Cracks in the beams that support the ceiling led to a security closure of at least six months, as announced by an estimate released on 9 October 2012 by the Parliament administration. This in turn led to a reshuffle of the Parliament's timetable. In early December 2012, it became known that the damage was more serious than previously thought, and that the closure of the hemicycle was expected to last \\"until November 2013\\". All \\"mini plenary\\" meetings in Brussels until this date were scrapped, a decision that was met with \\"fury\\" by some MEPs. Since, as of December 2012, the European Parliament is \\"having trouble\\" finding a company to carry out the repair work, it is likely that the reopening of the Brussels hemicycle may take place only in 2014. =Criticism= The Louise Weiss building has been subjected to criticism for its complex interior design : \\"It is apparently transparent but almost impossible to navigate; there are bridges between different levels, but you cannot quite work out where they lead\\".\\"Talking in circles\\", Tim Adams, The Observer, 25 November 2007 When it was opened, it was condemned by some for being \\"shabby, dark, difficult to navigate\\" with telecommunications and lifts being plagued by technical difficulties; Parliament President Nicole Fontaine climbed nine flights of stairs to her office rather than risk being trapped in the notorious lifts.Banks, Martin (13 August 2008) Roof caves in on EU parliament building, The Parliament Magazine In 2002, the building's water supply was hit by an outbreak of Legionnaires disease, due to the lack of use for much of the year (see \\"Secondary buildings\\" below)EU Parliament hit by Legionnaires disease, BBC News (8 June 2002) and in 2008 the ceiling of the plenary chamber collapsed (see \\"Hemicycle\\" above). Secondary buildings There are four secondary buildings across the river from the Louise Weiss. Like the Louise Weiss, most of them follow the numbering system of Immeuble du Parlement Européen (French for \\"Building of the European Parliament\\") 1, 2 and 3; the most recent building, (Immeuble Václav Havel), has not yet (July 2017) officially received the number 5. The buildings 1 and 2 form a single complex along the river. The buildings 3 and \\"5\\" are located more inland and connected by a glass footbridge. On the site on which the complex was built, there previously stood the swimming pool of the Société des nageurs strasbourgeois (SNS), built in 1952 and demolished in 1978 to make way.Piscine de la SNS, archi-strasbourg.org The Winston Churchill building (IPE 1) is located on Avenue du Président Schuman, in the Orangerie district. It houses administration and support facilities. The Salvador de Madariaga building (IPE 2), along Quai du Bassin de l'Ill, is located next to the Winston Churchill building. Both buildings, designed by the municipal architect François Sauer with the assistance of Jean-Paul Friedmann on behalf of the SERS actually form one single complex with a surface of 58,400m², built at a cost of 81 million euros, inaugurated in 1980 (later modified in 1988 and 1991, in relation to the construction of the IPE 3) and designed in a post-modern style often characterised by convoluted, serpentine architecture, relative heights and glazed facades., The Salvador de Madariaga building also houses the other EU body of which Strasbourg is the official seat (since 1992): the European Ombudsman. The buildings were at the centre of controversy regarding overpayment of rent.2004 discharge: sharp criticism but support for purchase of Strasbourg buildings europarl.europa.eu They were eventually bought by the Parliament in 2006. In October 2007 it was discovered that the buildings contained a larger amount of asbestos than previously thought before they were purchased. However the amount is still not deemed to be a public health risk and is limited to certain areas. The previous owner of the building may be responsible for finding and removing the asbestos within the building. This was not the first such incident as bacteria causing Legionnaires has been discovered in the water system of the complex after a number of officials reported in ill. The bacteria had been allowed to develop due to the Strasbourg complex being used only four months of the year.Kubosova, Lucia EU parliament buildings searched for asbestos, EUobserver 17 October 2007 The Pierre Pflimlin building (IPE 3), a heart-shaped, comparatively low building built on behalf of the SERS at the crossing of Avenue du Président Robert Schuman and Allée Spach, inaugurated in 1991 as a press and media center (Centre de presse et d'information) at a cost of 38 million euros, has been given the name of the former President of European Parliament on 6 July 2007.Press release The smallest of the buildings (21,000 m2), it is also the only one not to be next to the river or the canal. It now houses among other things the translation staff. The Václav Havel building was inaugurated on 5 July 2017 by EP President Antonio Tajani, and French Minister for European Affairs, Nathalie Loiseau. The building, originally opened in 1954, belonged to the Council of Europe, which used it until 2007. In 2012, it was purchased by the European Parliament, which completely deconstructed and reconstructed it. Former buildings From left to right: Louise Weiss, Winston Churchill, Pierre Pflimlin, Václav Havel (before the transformation, photo taken in 2008), and Council of Europe buildings. The present buildings were constructed due to the enlargement of the European Union in 1995 (and the planned enlargement to the east in 2004). Due to the new members, the Parliament needed a larger hemicycle to hold debates, and more offices for MEPs. Prior to this, Parliament shared the facilities of the Council of Europe, who had built a hemicycle in their headquarters: the Palace of Europe. That hemicycle was inaugurated for the Parliament's use, and for the use of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, on 28 January 1977. However, the sharing of this chamber could cause confusion for TV audiences unsure which institution was using it at the time. This was exacerbated by the EU and the Council of Europe both using the same flag, although the two did use their own emblems as well. Before the Palace of Europe was built in 1977, the two institutions also shared the Maison de l'Europe (\\"House of Europe\\") from 1958. The Maison was a provisory concrete building of purely functional architecture and was inaugurated in 1950. It stood where there is now a lawn leading up to the Palace of Europe.

It is native to the west coast of North America, ranging from Alaska to California. It is found in various habitats including beaches during very low tides, and at depths down to about . Also known as the vermilion sea star, it is the type species of the genus Mediaster and was first described in 1857 by the American zoologist William Stimpson. Pl. 23, figs. 7–11. Description M. aequalis has five (occasionally four or six) stumpy arms and grows to a diameter of up to . The aboral (upper) surface is bright red while the oral (under) surface is an orangey-red. The tube feet are red. There is a row of conspicuous marginal plates along the edge of the arms on the aboral surface, and the central disc bears many flat-topped ossicles (platelike calcareous structures); these consist of a central group of granules surrounded by a ring of about twenty-five marginal granules. Distribution and habitat M. aequalis is native to the western coast of North America, its range extending from Chignik Bay in Alaska southwards to Baja California. It often inhabits rocky substrates, at depths ranging from the low intertidal to around . Ecology M. aequalis is both an omnivore and a predator and will scavenge for dead animals and detritus. As well as feeding on algae, it preys on tunicates (such as sea pork), sea pens, sponges, bryozoans, brachiopods and polychaete worms. In its turn it is hunted by the larger morning sun star. It can move at the rate of per minute, which is fast for a starfish. Juvenile M. aequalis often congregate among the tubes of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica, a tube-dwelling worm, and research in Washington state has shown that the larvae are highly selective in where they settle, exclusively choosing to do so on these tubes.

Harmon Foundation Award for Distinguished Achievement Among Negroes was created in 1926.Gates & Higginbotham, p. 3. It was known as an award for excellence in the visual arts, but was offered for distinguished achievement in many different fields among Negroes or in the cause of race relations. This helped art education programs grow in many areas. Among the many recipients of the awards were Hale Woodruff, Palmer Hayden, Archibald Motley (his winning piece was The Octoroon Girl), Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes. In addition to the awards, the Foundation is well known for its traveling exhibitions. An annual Exhibition of the Work of Negro Artists, conceived by Mary Brady, was held in 1927 through 1931, 1933, and 1935. Laura Wheeler Waring was one of the artists featured the first year of the exhibitions, and the Foundation commissioned her to do portraits of prominent African Americans. The traveling exhibitions awarded \\"substantial prizes\\" together with gold, silver and bronze medals.Driskell p. 87. According to Gates and Higginbotham, \\"...submissions in the fine arts category was the chief venue open to African American artists.\\" See also *List of winners of the William E.

On June 15, 1948, Britt was at the microphone on WBZ-TV for the first live telecast of a Major League game in New England, as the Boston Braves defeated the Chicago Cubs, 6–3, at Braves Field. A native of San Francisco, California, Britt graduated from the University of Detroit and began his broadcasting career in Michigan before taking on play-by-announcing for the University of Notre Dame's football and basketball teams, then the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball club. He joined the air staff of Boston's WNAC radio in 1939.Buchanan, William, Sportscaster Jim Britt, 70, found dead in California home, The Boston Globe, January 6, 1981; retrieved from archives Boston Braves and Red Sox From 1940 through 1950, with time out for United States Navy service in World War II, Britt was the voice of both the National League Boston Braves and the American League Boston Red Sox, succeeding Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman and manager Frankie Frisch as play-by-play broadcaster when Frisch returned to uniform as pilot of the 1940 Pittsburgh Pirates.Fitzgerald, Ray, Commentary: A voice from Hub's past is stilled, The Boston Globe, January 6, 1981; retrieved from archives Britt also hosted an evening sports show on WNAC. At the time, the Braves and Red Sox each broadcast only their home games and shared announcing teams and flagship stations. Because the MLB schedules were then arranged so that the two Boston clubs were never home at the same time, there were no schedule conflicts. As such, Britt was the voice of two pennant-winning clubs, the 1946 Red Sox and the 1948 Braves. At the close of the 1950 season, that co-operative arrangement ended and each team decided to air a full schedule of 154 games, home and away. Britt chose to stay with the Braves, and the Red Sox were left to look for their own lead announcer. As fate would have it, the Sox would hire the \\"second banana\\" for the New York Yankees — a Mel Allen protégé named Curt Gowdy — who would be the voice of the Red Sox for 15 years before moving on to NBC's Game of the Week and a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame as a Ford C. Frick Award winner. Meanwhile, the Braves' attendance fell disastrously in 1951 and 1952, and the club moved to Milwaukee in March 1953, in the middle of spring training. Cleveland Indians and national work Britt did not accompany the Braves to Wisconsin. Instead, he joined the TV announcing crew of the Cleveland Indians in 1954, working through 1957 with Ken Coleman, a native of the Boston area (and Gowdy's eventual successor, in 1966, as voice of the Red Sox). The highlight of Britt's Cleveland tenure was the Indians' 1954 American League pennant with their league-record 111–43 season (one game better than the 110–44 1927 Yankees). But the Indians were upset in four straight games by the New York Giants in the ensuing 1954 World Series. Nationally, Britt participated in the Mutual network radio coverage of the World Series in 1948 and 1950, and worked on NBC's television coverage of the Series in 1949 and 1951. He also announced several baseball All-Star Games in the late 1940s and early '50s, as well as NFL games on the DuMont network and college football coverage (including the 1953 Sugar Bowl game) on ABC. Return to Boston Britt returned to Boston in the late 1950s as a newscaster and sportscaster for the city's ABC affiliate, then WHDH-TV, Channel 5, which also telecast Red Sox games; but he never regained his former role announcing for the Sox. Instead, he initiated a popular candlepin bowling show he would host until 1961, and also hosted Dateline: Boston (a nonsports predecessor to many of the modern-day magazine- style television programs) and an ABC-TV network series of hourlong 18-hole matches between two golfers called All-Star Golf featuring the best of their time including Ben Hogan, Sammy Snead, Lloyd Mangrum and Billy Casper. In retirement he eventually returned to his native California, where he died, aged 70, in Monterey.

On 3 March 1934, he succeeded to the title of 6th Baronet Morgan, 4th Baron Tredegar, and 2nd Viscount Tredegar, after the death of his father. Life He was the son of Courtenay Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar, of Tredegar Park, Monmouthshire, Wales, and Lady Katharine Carnegie. The 13th Duke of Bedford described the Tredegar family as \\"the oddest family I have ever met\\".Russell, John Robert, Duke of Bedford, A Silver Plated Spoon, Cassell, London 1959, pp. 64–65 The 2nd Viscount was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford University. While working as private secretary to a government minister, W. C. Bridgeman, in 1917, he became friendly with another Oxford man, the poet Robert Graves, who had been a school friend of Evan's cousin, Raymond Rodakowski. They shared an interest in both poetry and the supernatural. A Roman Catholic convert, Morgan was a Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape to Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI. An accomplished occultist, he was hailed by Aleister Crowley as Adept of Adepts. He fought in the First World War, gaining the rank of lieutenant in the service of the Welsh Guards. During the Second World War with MI8, his responsibility was to monitor carrier pigeons. He carelessly let slip on occasion departmental secrets to two girl guides and was court martialed but not sent to jail or worse. Tredegar House In 1929, he unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative candidate for Limehouse. After the death of his father, in May 1934, he took possession of the family seat of Tredegar House, near Newport, where he lived alone with a menagerie of animals and birds.

President of APLU McPherson has been president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), the nation’s oldest higher education association, since 2006. During his tenure, McPherson has expanded the association's federal advocacy and worked on efforts aimed at boosting degree completion, enhancing transparency and accountability, strengthening university’s research enterprise, and expanding community and economic engagement. McPherson spearheaded the creation of APLU’s Powered by Publics: Scaling Student Success initiative, which launched in November 2018.http://www.aplu.org/news-and- media/News/public-research-universities-unveil-unprecedented-national-effort- to-increase-college-access-equity--postsecondary-attainment https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/12/aplu-enlists-130-universities- collaboration-completion-and-equity-gaps The effort is convening 130 change- ready institutions within 16 “transformation clusters” – reaching 3 million undergraduate students, including 1 million Pell Grant recipients. The effort is aiming to increase college access, eliminate the achievement gap, and award hundreds of thousands more degrees by 2025. It represents the largest-ever such collaborative work. APLU is broadly sharing lessons from the collaboration to help spur student-centered transformation across the sector. McPherson has also championed a range of transparency and accountability efforts. In 2007, he led APLU’s role in co-founding the Voluntary System of Accountability – which was designed to enable institutions to demonstrate their voluntary commitment to publishing access, cost, and student outcomes measures for the benefit of the public, prospective students, and lawmakers. The VSA has since evolved into a data analytics tool for universities to improve their strategic planning and decision making. Building on those efforts, APLU co-founded the Student Achievement Measure (SAM) in 2014 to provide a more complete understanding of student success at universities. SAM was created to address flawed federal education data that only counts first- time, full-time students who receive federal financial aid.https://www.studentachievementmeasure.org/ Another focus of McPherson’s leadership has been the expansion of community and economic engagement efforts. In 2013, APLU launched the Innovation and Economic Prosperity (IEP) Designation and Awards program to recognize universities that are leaders in spurring and promoting regional economic development. Participating institutions complete a rigorous self-study process and earn the IEP designation if enough benchmarks are met. More than 60 universities have received the designation.http://www.aplu.org/projects-and- initiatives/economic-development-and-community-engagement/innovation-and- economic-prosperity-universities-designation-and-awards-program/ His leadership of APLU has also included a permanent partnership with the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities (USU) in an effort to incubate and promulgate the reforms necessary to help public urban research universities best serve their rapidly changing student populations. USU works with these institutions to pilot, refine, and share the most effective practices to accelerate innovation across higher education. Its work is centered on recruiting, admitting, retaining, and graduating high‐need, traditionally at‐risk students while reducing costs, reexamining campus business models, and fostering mutually beneficial campus‐community engagements.

The national cup, regulated by the KTFF is the Cypriot Cup. The winner of the league and the cup play the KTFF Super Cup. Due to the international sports embargo against Northern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot teams cannot play international matches.  History  Football was introduced to Cyprus on 1878 with the arrival of British troops. There are 2,500 licensed players in Northern Cyprus. The national team is currently ranked number one in the NF-Board standings, and is ranked higher than all non-FIFA teams in the World Football Elo Ratings.World Football Elo Ratings In the first years after the Turkish invasion in 1974, Turkish Cypriot football teams were able to play international matches against teams from countries such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Libya. This was due to the tolerance shown by FIFA upon the initiative of its secretary-general, Helmut Käser. However, after the declaration of independence in 1983, Turkish Cypriot teams and the national team lost the ability to play international matches. A Turkish team, Fenerbahçe SK, had a camp in Northern Cyprus in 1990 and planned to play with a local team, but the match was not allowed by FIFA, who refused to accept the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation as a member. In the ELF Cup that took place in Northern Cyprus in 2006, FIFA successfully pressured the Afghan national team not to play in the tournament, and FIFA members Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan sent their futsal teams instead. A Turkish Cypriot bid to join FIFA was rejected again in 2004, after the Annan Plan referendums.Daria Isachenko, The Making of Informal States: Statebuilding in Northern Cyprus and Transdniestria, p.189 In 2007, a friendly football match between Çetinkaya Türk S.K. and Luton Town F.C. was cancelled after Greek Cypriot pressure. In 2014, the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation applied to join the Cyprus Football Association, but the talks reached a deadlock.

The first ever women's football league in Northern Cyprus, the KTFF Women's League, was established in the 2007-08 season with seven teams. The number of teams later increased to nine. However, the lack of teams and interest, as well as violence in matches resulted in the cancellation of the league by the federation.

The name originates from the end result looking like a French cuff of a shirt sleeve, which has a ridge at the end. Also known as tunnelling, it is a common modification used on leadsleds and customs since the 1930s. Frenching a headlight or taillight is done in one of two ways: either removing the bezel, mounting the light deeper in the car's head or taillight nacelle and using the headlight rings from another car (or an aftermarket kit) to mount it deeper into the body. Or it can be done by modifying the light's mountings so that they can be removed from behind, welding the bezel to the body once the chrome plating is removed and painting it body colour. This gives the effect of visually lengthening the car, as well as smoothing out the body. Many customs have lights from another car transplanted in place of the original factory items, but even these are frenched as well. This modification is seldom carried out on late models, as newer cars have flush-fitting headlights. This is a styling cue both influenced by customising and a means of improving the aerodynamics of the car. Tunnelling This is done by cutting an area of sheet metal the shape of a number plate (for example), fabricating a box and welding it deeper into the body. The same principle is used in recessing car radio antennas, only that a hole must be drilled into the bottom of the tubing to let water drain out, reducing the risk of corrosion. This modification is still used on minitrucks, leadsleds and customized cars to this day.

Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet (\\"Theresienstadt: A Documentary Film from the Jewish Settlement Area\\"), unofficially Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt (\\"The Führer Gives a City to the Jews\\"), was a black-and-white projected Nazi propaganda film. It was directed by the German Jewish prisoner Kurt Gerron and the Czech filmmaker Karel Pečený under close SS supervision in Theresienstadt concentration camp, and edited by Pečený's company, Aktualita. Filmed mostly in the fall of 1944, it was completed on 28 March 1945 and screened privately four times. After the war, the film was lost but about twenty minutes of footage was later rediscovered in various archives. Unlike other Nazi propaganda films, which were under the control of Joseph Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda, Theresienstadt was conceived and paid for by the Jewish Affairs department of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, at the initiative of Hans Günther. The film, which displayed supposedly happy and healthy Jews, was part of a larger Nazi program to use Theresienstadt as a tool to discredit reports of the genocide of Jews reaching the Western Allies and neutral countries. However, it was not widely distributed and did not have the opportunity to influence public opinion. Background Theresienstadt was a Nazi ghetto in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia—the German-occupied Czech lands—built inside a repurposed fortified town, Terezín. Between 1941 and 1945, some 140,000 Jews were transported to the camp. Before the war, it housed about 7,000 people; during the camp's existence, the average population was about 45,000. About 33,000 died at Theresienstadt and almost 90,000 were deported to ghettos, extermination camps, and other killing centers, where they faced almost certain death. In 1942, a Nazi propaganda film was filmed at Theresienstadt. Unlike other Nazi propaganda films, the initiative came from Hans Günther, director of the SS Central Office for the Settlement of the Jewish Question in Bohemia and Moravia, a section of the Reich Main Security Office, rather than the Reich Ministry of Propaganda of Joseph Goebbels. This was the result of a power struggle between Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich and Goebbels; Heydrich won the concession that all propaganda produced in the Protectorate would be run through a special office in the Protectorate administration. The film was probably written by , a Czech Jewish prisoner who had run a film studio in Prague with her husband before the war. Little is known about it, since it is little mentioned in the memoirs and testimonies of Theresienstadt survivors, and was only rediscovered in fragmentary form in 1994. In an attempt to preserve its credibility and preeminence as a humanitarian organization while reports on the mass extermination of Jews continued to reach the Western Allies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) requested to visit Theresienstadt in November 1943. On 23 June 1944, Maurice Rossel, an ICRC delegate, and two Danish officials went on a tour of Theresienstadt. In preparation for the visit, the Germans \\"beautified\\" and cleaned the camp prior to arrival and arranged cultural activities to give the appearance of a happy, industrious community. To cover up the endemic overpopulation of the camp, thousands of people were deported to Auschwitz before the arrival of the Red Cross delegation. In his report, Rossel claimed that Jews were treated well and not deported from Theresienstadt. Rossel gave copies of photographs he took during the visit to the German Foreign Ministry, which used them to claim that Jews were treated well under Nazi rule. Filming Shooting the film Preparations for a second Theresienstadt film, again sponsored by Günther rather than Goebbels, began concurrently with the \\"beautification\\" of the ghetto prior to the Red Cross visit. Günther's Central Office, which was funded by stolen Jewish property, paid a Czech company, Aktualita, 350,000 Czech koruna (35,000 Reichsmarks) to produce the film. In December 1943, a prisoner, probably Jindřich Weil, was ordered to write a script, and he finished two drafts by March. On 20 January 1944, the Nazis filmed the arrival of a transport of Danish Jews and a welcome speech by Paul Eppstein, with a view of including it in a later film. There was no effort to complete the film before the Red Cross visit and screen it to the guests. Karel Margry, a Dutch historian who has studied the Theresienstadt propaganda films, argues that the \\"beautification\\" efforts had a higher priority, and that the propaganda would be more effective if filmed after the ghetto had been beautified. Kurt Gerron, a leading German Jewish actor and director, had fled to the Netherlands and was deported from Westerbork to Theresienstadt in February 1944. In July, the film project was revived and Gerron was ordered to write a script, which was used in the film. While the script has traditionally been credited to Gerron, it closely adhered to Weil's draft and the dictates of the SS; his creative role was minimal. Although he is usually credited with directorship of the film, Gerron's role in the filming was more symbolic than substantial, according to Spanish film historian Rafael de España. Eyewitnesses report that Gerron was constantly urging Jews to behave as mirthfully as the Germans wished and organizing mass scenes. However, SS men oversaw the filming, and Rahm and even Günther supervised scenes. When Rahm was not present on set, Gerron had to send him detailed reports. Bedřich Fritta's caricature of the filming. Filming took place over eleven days between 16 August and 11 September 1944. The assistant directors were František Zelenka, Jo Spier, and . Karel Pečený and his company Aktualita provided the cameramen, and halfway through filming, Pečený effectively took over as director. The two cameramen were Ivan Frič and Čeněk Zahradníček, assisted by Benda Rosenwein. The film's soundtrack has been credited to Jaroslav Sechura and Josef Francek. Aktualita collaborated with the German newsreel company Favoritfilm in producing the film. Prisoners of stereotypically Jewish appearance who were not obviously malnourished were chosen to appear in the film. They were given time off work for rehearsals and filming, and those unwilling to appear were threatened with harsh punishment. On 28 October, Gerron was deported to Auschwitz, where he was murdered, never seeing even a preliminary version of the film. The film was cut by Ivan Frič, who did not use Gerron's proposals for cutting or any of the scripts, but instead using the same improvised technique that he used for Aktualita's weekly newsreels. Frič had to cut the ending three times before Günther accepted it. The final cut bore little resemblance to Gerron's July script, his later editing proposal, or his creative vision for the film. In March, Aktualita sent a crew to the camp in order to collect some samples of \\"Jewish music\\", including snippets of the work of Felix Mendelssohn, Jacques Offenbach, and the children's opera Brundibár by Theresienstadt prisoner Hans Krása. The music was performed under the direction of Danish Jewish composer Peter Deutsch, who had experience with film soundtracks before the war. The SS completed the film on 28 March 1945, in time to present to the ICRC delegation that arrived on 6 April 1945. Content Testimonies agree that the film ran about 90 minutes, the standard length. Survivors remember what was filmed, but not which scenes were used in the final version. Although the full film was lost, a surviving document from the editing stage lists all the sequences as they appeared in the final version, and from surviving fragments and the drawings of Jo Spier, historians have \\"a very good idea of the visual image of virtually every scene in the film's 38 sequences\\", according to Margry. Nothing survives of a scene showing the self-government's court and a different scene in a dining hall. The film opens with the children's choir, directed by Karel Fischer, singing Mendolssohn's oratorio, Elijah. The Ghetto Swingers, a jazz band, plays outside, and \\"Prominent\\" prisoners enjoy food and beverages on a terrace and in a sham coffee house. Various sports events are also performed. The first eight sequences of the film show only leisure activities, setting the tone for the rest of the film and casting Theresienstadt as a holiday resort. Later sections of the film focus on work, including the Jewish self-government, construction projects, craft workshops, and agriculture. H. G. Adler notes that the type of work depicted in the film was not typical of that performed by most prisoners. Fake institutions, such as a bank and various shops, also are shown. Theresienstadt medical care, including a hospital and recuperation home, makes an appearance. Family life and unstructured leisure time is depicted towards the end of the film. The final scene is of a performance of the children's opera Brundibár. Fritta's drawing of the sham coffeehouse in the film Karl Rahm insisted that the \\"Prominent\\" prisoners of Theresienstadt be filmed, and pressed Gerron to include more of them in his shots. Among the \\"Prominents\\" who appeared were Jo Spier, Max Friediger, Paul Eppstein, and Leo Baeck. The SS also insisted that the film's soundtrack consist exclusively of Jewish composers. According to España, the film itself is of good technical quality, and the focus on leisure activities creates an \\"atmosphere of a perpetual party\\". Margry states that the narration was \\"the main truth-distorting element\\", but nevertheless included some factual information. According to Margry, historians have exaggerated the falseness of the film. Although Theresienstadt as a whole is \\"a vicious work of propaganda\\", \\"the visual authenticity\\" of the film is greater than many commentators have written, and the film accurately depicts some elements of daily life in the ghetto. Aftermath The film was not intended to be shown in Germany; the Nazi propagandists hoped to distribute it in neutral countries to counter Allied news reports about the persecution of Jews. However, by the time the film was completed on 28 March 1945, Germany's imminent defeat made this impossible. An alternative interpretation was that by the time it was completed, the film was intended for a much more select audience and narrowly focused on the cinematic portrayal of \\"Prominent\\" prisoners who had in fact been murdered at Auschwitz in order to persuade the ICRC that they were still alive. Because of this more select audience, Czech film historian Natascha Drubek argues that the film was not propaganda in a true sense. The film is known to have been screened at least three times. According to Margry, in late March or early April at Czernin Palace in Prague, the film was shown privately to a few high-ranking SS officers, including Higher SS and Police Leader for the Protectorate, Karl Hermann Frank, as well as Günther and Rahm. It was shown at Theresienstadt on 6 April to a Red Cross delegation including Otto Lehner and Paul Dunant, accompanied by Swiss diplomat Buchmüller; Frank's subordinate Erwin Weinmann was also present. Pointing to testimony that Rahm was bedridden with fever on 6 April, Drubek argues that these two screenings were in fact the same, and that Lehner and Dunant saw the film on 6 April at Czernin Palace with Frank, but not Rahm, in attendance. On 16 April the film was shown twice at Theresienstadt, first to Benoît Musy, son of Jean-Marie Musy, a Swiss politician and negotiator with Himmler, in the company of SS officer Franz Göring. After Musy left, the film was shown to Rudolf Kastner, chairman of the Hungarian Jewish Aid and Rescue Committee; Kastner was escorted by two members of Eichmann's staff. Günther, his deputy Gerhard Günel, Rahm, and Jewish elder Benjamin Murmelstein were also present. All of those who viewed the film had access to independent reports that hundreds of thousands of Jews were being murdered at Auschwitz and there is no indication that any of them were affected by the film. At Pečený's recommendation, the SS deposited 25 crates of film footage in Favoritfilm's warehouse in Holešovice shortly before the Prague uprising broke out. The warehouse was damaged by an incendiary bomb on 7 May. Eva Strusková suggests that Günther may have ordered the film to be destroyed. There is no proof that Theresienstadt was in the warehouse, so it is possible that the film was otherwise lost. Historiography In the postwar era, the film was lost, but continued to be the focus of discussion. The RSHA archives were burned in 1945, so the Nazis' paperwork relating to Theresienstadt was also destroyed. Less than 25 minutes of footage were later discovered in various archives. Přemysl Schönbach discovered fragments of the film in Mšeno in May or June 1945. He kept them in a private archive, but showed them to Vladimír Kressl, a lecturer at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague in 1964, which resulted in a copy of the footage being deposited into the Czechoslovak national archives that same year. The same year, Schönbach sold the rights to Michael Bornkamp, a West German journalist, who subsequently used the footage in a documentary So schön war es in Terezin (It was so nice in Terezín), which was screened at the 1965 Oberhausen Film Festival. Because Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule at the time, Schönbach was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence for causing financial loss to the Czechoslovak nation. Also in 1965, the Czechoslovak authorities allowed the creation of a documentary based on the footage, Město darované (The Given Town), which is still used by the Terezín Ghetto Museum today. Fragments of footage including the title sequence were discovered in a former Gestapo building in Prague by former prisoner Jiří Lauscher at an unknown date and transferred to an Israeli archive, where they were rediscovered in 1987. A speech made by Paul Eppstein was discovered in Prague in 1997. The Israeli footage was broken into 24 fragments, the shortest of which was only one frame and the longest of which was two minutes. Another important source of information on what was filmed is the sketches of Jo Spier, a Dutch Jewish illustrator who observed the filming and made 332 sketches of scenes from the camera's viewpoint. Although some critics have assumed that his sketches were made before filming, this is not the case. According to Kurt Gerron's papers, the original title was Die jüdische Selbstverwaltung in Theresienstadt (The Jewish Self-Government in Theresienstadt); later, he used the short title Theresienstadt. Excerpts of the film discovered in the Israeli archive in 1988 revealed the official title to be Theresienstadt, with the subtitle Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet (A Documentary Film from the Jewish Settlement Area). According to Margry, the Nazis called it a \\"documentary film\\" in order to cast the film as an authentic representation of Theresienstadt life rather than staged propaganda, while the last three words imply that there were more \\"Jewish settlements\\" like Theresienstadt. It is believed that Jewish prisoners gave the film an ironic title, Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt, (\\"The Führer Gives a City to the Jews\\"), during the final months of the war, which was used as the title until 1988. The misconception about the correct title has been used in a number of analyses of Nazi propaganda by film critics. Film historians have often claimed that the film was ordered by Goebbels, but that is not the case. Many scholars have claimed that the film was ordered after the June Red Cross visit, but it was prepared from late 1943. The earlier origin of the film discredits many theories that have been offered for why the Nazis ordered the film. It has also been claimed that Heinrich Himmler was closely involved in the production of the film and showed it to the Western Allied agents with whom he was conducting secret negotiations in late 1944. However, the only evidence suggesting that he knew of the film's existence is a letter between his secretary, Rudolf Brandt, and personal masseur, Felix Kersten, in March or April 1945. Legacy The German film website filmportal.de describes the film as \\"one of the most cynical and despicable Nazi propaganda films\\". In a review of the 2002 Canadian documentary Prisoner of Paradise, which focused on Gerron's role in the film, Entertainment Weekly states that the 1944 film was \\"a work of propaganda so perverse one is shocked to realize that even the Nazis could have thought of it\\". For many years, it was assumed that the participants in the film were collaborators, and they were judged very harshly. Karel Pečený was convicted of collaborationism in 1947 and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, ten years' loss of civil rights, and the nationalization of his company and other assets. Later appraisal has tempered this assessment. Margry states that Aktualita's participation was probably coerced by the SS. He notes that Frič smuggled still images out of the studio at considerable personal risk and Pečený risked his life by delaying the completion of the film until after it was no longer useful to Günther. The film has been used by Holocaust deniers to make false generalizations about the treatment of Jews by the Nazi regime.

He has painted 255 maps for 175 ski resorts around the world. Early life Niehues was raised on a farm in Loma, Colorado, and attended Fruita Monument High School. He began painting at the age of 15, when he fell ill with nephritis and his mother gave him an oil painting set to keep him occupied while he was bedridden for three months. Career After serving in the U.S. Army from 1965 to 1969, Niehues worked in advertising, printing and graphic design. In 1987, while working at a Denver print shop, he met Bill Brown, a painter of ski resort maps who was nearing retirement.The Man Behind Most of the Ski Maps in America Brown gave him his first assignment as a map painter: a small inset map commissioned by Winter Park Resort in Colorado. After his map was accepted by Winter Park, Niehues printed copies of his illustration and sent them to the marketing managers of ski resorts across the U.S. to advertise his map- painting services. The first resort to respond was Vail Ski Resort, which hired him to paint a new trail map. The first ski map that he designed and painted by himself was Boreal Mountain Resort in California; as of 2016, Niehues' map was still in use, 29 years after it was created. Niehues' method of painting ski trails begins with aerial photographs of the mountain that he either takes himself or obtains from Google Earth. He then sketches the mountain based on the photographs and adds color and detail with watercolor paints and an airbrush. By 2016, Niehues had painted 255 maps for 175 ski resorts around the world. The largest resorts he has painted for include Aspen, Breckenridge, Crested Butte, Copper Mountain and Winter Park in Colorado, Big Sky Resort in Montana, Boyne Mountain Resort in Michigan, Killington Ski Resort in Vermont, Mount Bachelor in Oregon, Sugarloaf in Maine, and Mont Tremblant Resort and Whistler Blackcomb in Canada. He estimates that he has created trail maps for 75% of the large ski resorts in the U.S. In 2011, his work was displayed in an exhibition at Apexart in New York City. He semi-retired in 2014, and lives in Loveland, Colorado. Niehues' work has drawn numerous comparisons to famous artists: he has been called \\"the Michelangelo of snow\\", \\"Rembrandt of the ski trail\\", \\"Monet of the mountain\\", and the \\"Norman Rockwell of ski resorts\\".

It was completed in 1927, and is located in the South Temple Historic District of Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. General information Salt Lake Masonic Temple, December 2007 The Salt Lake Masonic Temple consists of several Lodge rooms, greater and lesser Halls, numerous lounges, a banquet hall, an auditorium, a library and administrative offices. The Temple is currently home to the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Utah; five Salt Lake City Masonic Lodges (Wasatch Lodge No. 1, Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 2, Argenta Lodge No. 3, Salt Lake Lodge No. 17, and Progress Lodge No. 22) The Orient of Utah of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry; the Grand York Rite Bodies of Utah, and constituent Salt Lake York Rite Bodies; El Kalah Shrine; as well as the Grand Bodies for the ladies and youth organizations. The building remains in continual use since it opened in 1927 and is maintained and operated by the Salt Lake Masonic Temple Association. Usage The primary function of the building is the performance of the various rituals of the several Masonic organizations in Salt Lake City, and to provide a convenient location for administrative functions of the Utah Masonic family. The building is available for use by non-Masonic entities and persons. History The decision to build the Salt Lake Masonic Temple took shape in the fall of 1920 as the Masonic population in Salt Lake City had outgrown the existing Temple then located at the intersection of 2nd East and 1st South. The architect and Building Committee traveled to other cities reviewing existing Masonic Temples for favorable and unfavorable elements. Ultimately the committee resolved that the Salt Lake Masonic Temple be unique and not copied from existing Temples. By 1925 the plans had been completed, the land was purchased, and the interior furnishings arranged. Much of the discussion preserved from the planning meetings centers on the amount of Masonic symbolism built into the Temple, and how it should be concealed, if at all. Features Egyptian Room at Salt Lake Masonic Temple, December 2007 The Salt Lake Masonic Temple has been considered Salt Lake's best example of Egyptian Revival architecture. The Egyptian motif was chosen for several reasons: 1. the Egyptian style was the height of fashion at the time; 2. existing Temples largely followed elements of the classical orders of architecture, so the Egyptian motif would ensure a unique Masonic experience; and 3. it provided ample opportunity to incorporate Masonic symbols without disclosing their presences or disrupting the visual harmony of the edifice. The exterior of the Temple is composed of \\"Temple Brick\\", a brick face specifically designed for the Salt Lake Masonic Temple, that subsequently became a popular decorative architectural element. Salt Lake Masonic Temple Lodge Room Decoration, December 2007 Light is perhaps the most significant symbol of Freemasonry, and the architect incorporated many Egyptian references to Light into the design of the Temple. Allusions to the Egyptian god Horus (then considered by Egyptologists to be a god of Light) occupy much of the building, including the cornice at the main entrance. There are three entrances to the Temple, alluding to the three Lights of a Masonic Lodge. The main entrance from the north of the building; as north is deemed a place of darkness in Masonic ritual, hence those coming through the front door are traveling toward light. The funerary ramp located west of the main entrance is surmounted by a scarab, the Egyptian symbol of resurrection and immortality, and together with the seven acacia flanking the ramp allude to Masonic belief in a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul. The main entrance is approached by a staircase of three flights respectively consisting of three, five, seven and nine steps. The staircase is flanked by two sphinxes. Each sphinx holds a single sphere, one celestial, one terrestrial, and each is arranged to contemplate its sphere.

The reservoir is located at an elevation of 1,313 m and comprises an area of 14 square kilometres. It is located in the natural park known as the \\"Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park\\". The lake is reachable via the Italian State Highway 80 from either L'Aquila or the Adriatic Coast. Smaller roads lead to Capitignano, Montereale and Amatrice. Description During the Quaternary Period of glacier formation, the Campotosto water basin had the form of a double \\"Y\\". Towards the end of this period, the Fucino River bed came into being. The upper portion of the artificial lake maintains the previously seen double \\"Y\\" formation that on the lower side is shaped more like a single \\"V\\". The area where the lake now sits was once a vast peat bog, this used as an energy source by the local small industries up until the early 20th century. Lake Campotosto was created in the 1930s by means of constructing three dikes. The main reason for creating the lake was to establish a water reservoir that could be used to generate hydroelectric power in the Vomano valley. During the construction of Lake Campotosto, a cableway leading to the Capitignano railway station was fortified. It was used to transport building materials and to carry earth away from the excavations. From Capitignano the rail line headed to L'Aquila following a course that had earlier been used for the transportation of peat. The rail line was abandoned soon after construction of the lake was completed. During the winter the lake freezes completely over while in the fall many people come for a visit to admire the colorful foliage in the nearby forests. Flora and fauna The Lake Campotosto Reserve, located in the Province of L'Aquila in Abruzzo is a state owned wildlife preservation area. Local species include beech, willow, and snakewood trees. Indigenous to the area are badgers, pheasants, and foxes. Lakeside attractions Lake Campotosto is surrounded by mountains. A circular trail about 50 km in length run along the perimeter of Lake Campotosto. It is rather flat in nature. In the summer it serves as a gathering place for many hiking, jogging, bicycle touring or simple romantic walks during the sunset hours. Shorter excursions can be arranged by cutting off one of the two main branches of the lake. A bridge, Ponte delle Stecche (\\"The Bridge of Sticks\\") has been built in one of the narrower sections of the lake. An older unused structure stands nearby. The traveler using this bridge is also able to greatly shorten his lakeside. The neighboring Capannelle Pass, is located about 15 km away and also attracts many cyclists and motorbikers in the warmer months of the year.

Early life Daeso was the first son of King Geumwa, and the grandson of Dongbuyeo's founder and first ruler, Hae Buru. As the eldest son of Geumwa, he was made Crown Prince of Dongbuyeo. Goguryeo's founder, Jumong's exceptional skill at archery gave cause for tremendous jealousy and envy from Daeso and his six brothers. Jumong knew that his continuing presence in Dongbuyeo placed him in real danger, so he decided to flee to Jolbon Buyeo. In 37 BC, Jumong established Goguryeo, the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In 7 BC, King Geumwa died, elevating Daeso to the throne of Dongbuyeo.  War with Goguryeo  As king, Daeso gathered enough military power to attack Goguryeo. Before attacking, however, he sent an envoy to Goguryeo's King Yuri, ordering him to send a royal hostage to Dongbuyeo. Goguryeo rejected the order leading to the first Goguryeo-Dongbuyeo war to occur in 6 AD. Daeso directly led a 50,000-man army into Goguryeo, but was forced to retreat when heavy snow began to fall. After this defeat, Daeso had to wait seven years before he could seek to regain what he had lost from the first war with Goguryeo. In 13 AD, Daeso led his armies into Goguryeo once again. This time, Muhyul, crown prince of Goguryeo, led the armies of Goguryeo in a well-planned ambush and slaughtered virtually all of Daeso's army. Only Daeso and a few of his men escaped back to Dongbuyeo.  Death and aftermath  After the death of Goguryeo's King Yuri, Crown Prince Muhyul rose to the throne to become King Daemusin. In 21 AD, King Daemusin led an army and invaded Dongbuyeo, eventually killing Daeso, but he didn't destroy Dongbuyeo. Instead, in 22 AD the third son of King Yuri, Dojin, was given responsibility for Dongbuyeo but with its territory being absorbed into the kingdom of Goguryeo.

Afterwards Lee went into a slump; though he continued to be a strong player and came in second or first place in various leagues and tournaments, Lee did not win an MSL or OSL until the IOPS Ongamenet Starleague in 2004 or 2005. However, not long afterwards, Lee would enter the darkest period in his career. On 18 July 2005, FiFo reported that Lee's father had been killed in an automobile accident when an intoxicated driver performed an illegal U-turn and collided with his father's vehicle.http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/viewblog.php?topic_id=65799 When Lee eventually returned to pro-gaming he began his return to the top. In December 2007, Lee was once again the number one-ranked pro gamer in the KeSPA rankings. It had been a full two years and five months since he had stopped performing in July 2004. Lee's comeback culminated in his victory in the 2006 2nd ShinHan Bank OnGameNet StarLeague. In his winner's interview, Lee dedicated his victory to his father, saying \\"Yes, it is my first time winning the finals with my mother seated as the audience. But, for this very victory, I give it all to my father, though he didn't make it. From now on, I will do my best for my mother.\\" This victory not only marked a successful comeback performance, but also was Lee's third OSL win, him becoming the first player in history to earn the OSL's Golden Mouse trophy and was Lee's sixth major title win, making him the then most accomplished Brood War player in the game's history. In 2007, Lee signed a three-year contract with WeMade FOX for approximately 690,000 USD. After his contract with the organization expired in 2010, Lee announced his intentions to fully switch to StarCraft II. Only after his retirement from Brood War was he equaled by Lee \\"Flash\\" Young-Ho for the most achievements in StarCraft: Broodwar. He joined the Korean team and gamer house of Old Generations and quickly became one of the strongest names in the StarCraft II scene, competing in the GOMTV Global StarCraft II League Season 2. There he advanced to the round of 8 before being defeated by Lim \\"BoxeR\\" Yo-Hwan. The following season Lee made it to round of 8 again, but was defeated by Lee \\"MarineKingPrime.WE\\" Jung-Hoon, losing 3 to 0.http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=185712 On 15 July 2011, SK Gaming announced a joint partnership with Old Generations, allowing for Lee and his teammate, Jang \\"MC\\" Min Chul, to be sponsored for international events on behalf of the organization. The partnership between Old Generations and SK Gaming ended on 13 January 2012, with Lee remaining with the former, while Jang remained with the latter until his contract expired at the end of January. On 16 February, Lee signed with American gaming team compLexity Gaming, wanting to participate in more StarCraft II events outside of Korea before leaving gaming to fulfill his mandatory South Korean Military service. It was announced that on 20 November 2011, Lee would be fulfilling his dream of becoming a CEO by opening up his own e-store, the NaDa Mall, which sells pro-gaming equipment.NaDa opens online store. Lee became married on 9 November 2015 at the Legacy of the Void launch party held at COEX in Seoul. Fans were invited to purchase a Collector's Edition of the expansion pack and following the wedding ceremony showmatches were held to showcase the new expansion. The video was also live-streamed on Twitch and Afreeca.

Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually had to settle for cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates occurred quite frequently in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.Scully pg. 218 Olive oil was among the ubiquitous ingredients around the Mediterranean, but remained an expensive import in the north where oil of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert was the most affordable alternative. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible blood-letting of the population during the Black Death, was used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, which was in the ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety came along much later.Scully pg. 83 Central Europe =Germany= Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus depicted dining on, among other things, a fish dish and a pretzel; illustration from Hortus deliciarum, Alsace, late 12th century. At no time during the Middle Ages was there a completely unified state that incorporated all or even a majority of all German-speaking peoples. The map was dotted with minor kingdoms, free cities and, in the High and Late Middle Ages, the ports controlled by the Hanseatic League, a powerful trading alliance. Most of these were under the loosely defined suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire. Here the definition of \\"Germany\\" is the lands where High and Low German was spoken, which extended roughly from Alsace in the west to Silesia in the east and from the Tyrol in the south to the Baltic Sea coast in the north. Though various forms of dishes consisting of batter or dough cooked in fat, like crêpes, fritters and doughnuts were common in most of Europe, they were especially popular among Germans and known as krapfen (Old High German: \\"claw, hook\\") and were quite similar to the deep-fried dough pastries of today. The extensive use of lard and butter for cooking and a diet that was perceived as especially fatty gained Germans a reputation as being the \\"fat Germans\\". The fasting regulations of the Catholic Church posed particular problems to the German population. Olives could not be cultivated and olive oil was an expensive import. Oils made from various nuts were available, but in relatively short supply. By far, the most common sources of fat were butter and, above all, lard. The price of fish was generally higher, and while it was unaffordable to most people for most of the time, the need to use fish for fasting days could mean considerable increases in expenses for the wealthier households. Mustard was used in other parts of Europe long before the Middle Ages, but seemed to be especially common in Germany. A 14th-century travel account by Eustache Deschamps, a French poet, shows his considerable discontent with the German custom of smearing generous amounts of mustard on just about every type of meat.Scully p. 233 It was rare that recipes for use in dire situations were included in recipe collections, but one example from a cookbook in Low German has been preserved.Regional Cuisines... pg. 159 It gives instructions for a wartime stew consisting of any available greens and vegetables to be boiled in animal stomachs or intestines, an effective method in situations where no proper kitchenware would be available. In the First Margrave War, the city of Nuremberg was able to feed its citizens properly and still emerge victorious through careful planning, extensive stockpiling of grain and meat and strict control of prices by the town council.Regional Cuisines Chapter 6: Medieval Germany =Poland= The most common grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, a type of porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost ubiquitous potherbs and parsley was used as a leafy green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only to eat it on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church. Beer was drunk by all social classes, and came in many different varieties and made from millet, wheat, barley, rye or oats sometimes in combination. Wheat beer was the most common. Labrador tea, a mildly toxic herb, was often used as an ingredient to increase intoxication. It was mixed with hops and then added to a barley and wheat beer to produce what was called \\"thick beer\\". Though often believed to be a common Slavic drink, mead was fairly expensive and primarily enjoyed at weddings and baptismal parties, though always overshadowed by the ever-present beer. It had a high standing as a ceremonial drink and used when arranging alliances and closing contracts. Wine was generally quite expensive and was enjoyed mostly by the nobility. Although there is evidence of a few vineyards in Poland, almost all wine had to be imported. A large variety of breads, like obwarzanki, were sold by vendors in Krakow as early as the 14th century and placki, flat cakes, came in a surprising number of varieties, including one variety with an apple topping, reminiscent of pizza. German bakers operating in Polish towns had much influence. Krepels (from German Krapfen, \\"claw; hook\\") were fried pastries with a cheese filling served with strawberries or other fruit, and resembled a modern empanada.Dembinska, Chapter 4 Northern Europe =Britain= William the Conqueror, detail from the Bayeux Tapestry, late 11th century. Relatively little is known about the eating habits of the Anglo-Saxons of the Early and High Middle Ages before the Norman conquest in 1066. Ale was the drink of choice of both commoners and nobles, and the known dishes included various stews, simple broths, and soups. The level of refinement was low, and international influence fairly insignificant. This all changed in the 11th century after the Norman invasion. With the invaders came a new and less provincial gentry, and new eating habits, especially for the nobility. While traditional British cooking today is not regarded with high esteem internationally, the Medieval Anglo-Norman cooks were considerably more refined and more cosmopolitan. It has previously been believed that the Anglo- Norman cuisine was mostly similar to that of France, but recent study has shown that many recipes had unique English traits. This was based partly on the different available foodstuffs on the British Isles, but more due to influence from Arab cuisine through the Norman conquest of Sicily. The Arab invaders in the 9th century had cultivated their lifestyle culturally and economically to such a degree that the Norman invaders inherited and adapted many of their habits, including cooking styles. Norman participation in the crusades also brought them into contact with Middle Eastern and Byzantine cooking. The subtlety (or entremet), the fanciful and highly decorative surprise dish used to separate one course from another, was brought to new levels of complexity and refinement by the English chefs. Among the specialties were pommes dorées (\\"gilded apples\\"), meatballs of mutton or chicken colored with saffron or a glaze of egg yolk. The Anglo-Norman variant, pommes d'orange, were flavored and coloured with the juice of bitter oranges.Regional Cuisines Chapter 4: Medieval Britain =Scandinavia= The climate in the far north of Europe made cultivation of cereals even more difficult, and the wheat so popular in the south was a luxury in northern Europe. Wheat could cost at least twice as much as the most common grains, barley and rye. Barley was the most widely grown, but a great percentage of the harvest went into the extensive beer production, while rye was the principal bread grain. Like in the rest of Europe, oats was considered only fit as animal fodder and was only eaten when no other choice was available, and then usually as porridge or gruel. Though grains were in the highest regard among medieval Scandinavians and were among the most frequently mentioned foods, other vegetable foods were an indispensable part of the diet: peas, turnips, beans, carrots, onions, leeks and various greens and herbs all provided essential nutrients and vitamins. Kale, a form of cabbage, was especially important in Denmark and Sweden and was a valuable source of fresh food in the winter months, since it kept well and could be harvested (and even tasted better) after the first frost had set in.Kjersgaard, p. 33-38 Fish was of great importance to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the herring fishing in the Limfjord and Oresund. The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers. The amount of fish caught was more than enough to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish. Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at Skanör in Scania, which was in the Middle Ages part of Denmark. From this market alone, merchant vessels of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels of salted herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages.Kjersgaard, p. 58 Of equal, or even greater importance was cod, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make stockfish, and imported as an important staple, particularly during fast and Lent. Many freshwater fish were also of great dietary or economic importance, such as salmon, eel, pike and bream. Cattle rearing was very widespread in Scandinavia, especially Denmark, where the Black Death had left huge field areas untended and well-suited for grazing. The majority of meat produced was consumed by the local population, but an export market for high-grade beef slowly built up after the 1360s, and had by the 17th century reached well over 100,000 animals per year. All this cattle meant not just meat, but also great quantities of dairy products, which consisted mostly of soured milk drinks, various cheeses and, also a major export product, butter.Kjersgaard, p. 45 Northern France Pressing wine after the harvest; Tacuinum Sanitatis, 14th century. Northern French cuisine had many similarities to the Anglo-Norman French across the channel, but also had its own specialties. Typical of the Northern French kitchen were the potages and broths, and French chefs excelled in the preparation of meat, fish, roasts, and the sauces that were considered appropriate to each dish. The use of dough and pastry, which was fairly popular in Britain at the time, was almost completely absent from recipe collections with the exception of a few pies. Nor were there any forms of dumplings or the fritters that were so popular in Central Europe. A common Northern French habit was to name dishes after famous and often exotic places and people. A specialty among finer French chefs was the preparation of so-called parti-colored dishes. These mimicked the late medieval fashion of wearing clothing with two colors contrasting one another on either side of the garment, a fashion that survived in the costumes of court jesters. The common Western European \\"white dish\\" (blanc manger) had a northern French variant where one side was colored bright red or blue. Another recipe in Du fait de cuisine from 1420 described an entremet consisting of a roasted boar's head with one half colored green and the other golden yellow.Regional Cuisines Chapter 4: Medieval France A. The North Western Mediterranean Roman influence on the entire Mediterranean region was so considerable that to this day, the basic food in most of the region is still wheat bread, olives, olive oil, wine, cheese, and the occasional piece of meat or fish. The territories from the Atlantic to the Italian Peninsula, and especially the Catalan and Occitan-speaking areas were closely interrelated culturally and politically. The Muslim conquest of Sicily and southern Spain was highly influential on the cuisine by introducing new plants like lemons, pomegranates, eggplants and spices such as saffron. The coloring of food and many other cooking techniques were passed on by the Arab invaders to their European possessions and were gradually spread to regions further north. =Iberia= The Iberian Peninsula has a highly varied geography with a central Meseta, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and cut off from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees. This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines. Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several Mediterranean cultures. The Phoenicians introduced the cultivation of olives and the Greeks brought the Malvasia grape, founding a wine industry that would become renowned in the Middle Ages. But it was the Roman Empire, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine. After the collapse of Roman rule, Visigothic invaders conquered most of the modern day Spain and Portugal in the 5th century. The Visigoths took on many Roman customs, like the focus on vegetables, and used Latin for official purposes. But it was the invasions of North African Muslims and the establishment of Al-Andalus that gave Iberian cuisine its unique nature. The Muslims brought with them the highly refined cuisine influenced by Arab courts in the Middle East. The center of this Arab civilization was Baghdad, at the time one of the largest cities in the world. The new rulers introduced many new customs and foodstuffs; goblets made of glass rather than metal, savory meat dishes cooked with fruit, spices and herbs like cinnamon, mastic, caraway, sesame and mint and the use of ground almonds or rice as thickeners and a fondness for adding tangy liquids like verjuice, tamarind and the juice of bitter oranges to produce a distinctly sweet-sour taste. The impact can clearly be seen in the multitude of Arab loanwords in Spanish; naranja \\"orange\\", azúcar (\\"sugar\\"), alcachofa (\\"artichoke\\"), azafrán (\\"saffron\\") and espinaca (\\"spinach\\"), many of which eventually spread to other languages in Europe. The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which still forms the basis for many modern European meals; soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets. It's also believed that escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, could very well be of Arab-Persian origin, though this has been contested. One of the earliest medieval cookbooks in a language other than Latin was Libre de Sent Soví (\\"The Book of Saint Sophia\\"), written in Catalan around 1324. A majority of its recipes call for bitter oranges, rose water and cider to achieve the popular tangy flavor of late medieval cuisine. It contains many fish recipes, but surprisingly enough, no mention of shellfish, which must have been one of the major food sources in the Catalan coastal regions. The highly influential Libre del Coch, in Catalan as well, was published in a printed edition in 1520, but is assumed to have been written no later than 1490. The typical medieval white dish (manjar blanco) seems to have appeared first in Catalonia in the 8th century and eventually evolved into a type of sweet pudding. While poorly represented in cookbooks, the most common food for the general population, other than the regular staples of bread, wine, garlic, onion and olive oil, included eggs, lamb, beef, kid and bacon. The Jewish population of Al-Andalus, the Sephardic Jews, developed their cuisine in close contact with Christians and Muslims. Influences went in both directions and lasted even after the expulsions and forced conversions of the Jewish population that followed the Reconquista. Among the specialties was adafina (from Arabic al dafina \\"the buried treasure\\"), a meat dish that was prepared by burying it in hot coals on the day before the Shabbat. Jewish fish pie dishes have survived in Spanish cuisine as empanadas de pescado.Regional Cuisines Chapter 5: Medieval Spain =Italy= Making noodles; Tacuinum Sanitatis, 14th century. The lucrative Mediterranean trade in spices, silk and other luxuries from Africa and Asia were shipped on the galleys of the powerful city-states of Genoa, Venice and Florence, making them phenomenally rich. Medieval Italy, meaning primarily the northern Italian Peninsula, was one of the few regions in medieval Europe where the distinction between nobility and prosperous commoners were more or less irrelevant, the result of a significant, rich and self-conscious middle class. This meant that the level of culinary refinement and diversity was especially great when compared to the rest of the continent. Italian cuisine was, and still is, better described as a multitude of highly varied regional cuisines, each with long traditions and their own specialties. Italian dishes can therefore be considered either traditional or imported. Being the hub of a vast trade network meant that there was greater access to foreign luxuries to influence the local cooking. Still, there was a great deal of conservatism and in general far more of local Italian foodstuffs were exported to the New World than the other way around, though the impact of important products such as vanilla, corn, kidney beans, and of course, the tomato, which had a considerable impact on the cooking south of Naples, even if this transition took some time.Regional Cuisines pg. 96 Many Italian staples and internationally recognized favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance; pasta was on everyone's dinner plate by the 13th century, though it was commonly made out of rice flour rather than durum wheat; pizza, the medieval Italian term for \\"pie\\", and tortes came in many varieties with a wide range of toppings, ranging from marzipan, and custards to chicken, eel, or even hemp; polenta made from French green lentils or barley; risotto; and a myriad of local or regional variants of sausage and cheese which was eaten by more or less everyone. As early as the Middle Ages, the cheeses, in particular, appear to have been highly specialized, from a fresh Tuscan to an aged Milanese from Tadesca, wrapped and shipped in tree bark. Medieval Italians also used eggs to a higher degree than many other regions, and the recipe collections describe herb omelettes (herboletos) and frittatas. Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the cooking fat of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.Regional Cuisines Chapter 4: Medieval and Renaissance Italy A. The Peninsula =Southern France= Green grapes being picked to make verjuice; Tacuinum Sanitatis, 1474. The cuisine of southern France, corresponding roughly to the extent of Occitania, had far more in common with Italian and Spanish cooking than with northern French cuisine. Ingredients that distinguished southern cooking included sugar, walnut oil, chickpeas, pomegranates and lemons, all of which were grown locally. While pomegranate seeds were occasionally used to decorate dishes in France and England, flavoring dishes with pomegranate juice was a practice unique to the Occitan areas. The use of butter and lard was rare, salted meat for frying was common, and the preferred methods of cooking tended to be dry roasting, frying, or baking. For the latter, a trapa, a portable oven that was filled with food and buried in hot ashes, was often used. Dishes still common today, like escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, and aillade (aioli), a garlic sauce (still made in Toulouse with walnut oil), were well-established in the Late Middle Ages. Evidence of influence from Muslim Spain can be found in recipes for matafeam, a Christian version of the originally Hispano-Jewish Shabbat stew adafina, but with pork rather than lamb. And, Raymonia (Occitan; Ital: Romania) is based on the Arabic Rummaniya, a chicken bruet with pomegranate juice, ground almonds, and sugar. Only one recipe collection is positively identified as being from southern France. The Modus viaticorum preparandorum et salsarum is a collection of 51 recipes. It was written ca. 1380–90 in Latin with occasional words in Occitan. The Modus contains a Salsa de cerpol (Wild thyme sauce) and a Cofiment anguille (Confit of eel), which appear nowhere else but in Occitania.Regional Cuisines Chapter 4: Medieval France B. The South A cookery book from northern Europe may have originated in Provence. Known from its incipit as Libellus de arte coquinaria, it is the Codex K version of the Harpestraeng Cookbook, which is part of a collection of medical papers written by, or belonging to, Dr. Henrik Harpestraeng. It is currently housed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen (Ny samling Nr. 66, 8 vo.). Food historian Dr. Rudolf Grewe proposed a NW Mediterranean origin for this book based on the recipes and their ingredients, such as saffron. Since Harpestraeng studied medicine in Provence, probably at Montpellier, he may have obtained the book during that time. Harpestraeng may have brought the book to Denmark, where he was the physician to King Valdemar II. Codex K is believed to have been copied into Danish from an earlier Low German original, or copy. This would have happened before 1244, the year Harpestraeng died. If so, Libellus de arte coquinaria is the earliest Western European cookery book, since Apicius' De re coquinaria.Grewe, Rudolf and Constance B. Hieatt, p. 69-71. Some dietary details have been extrapolated from Vatican archives from 1305–78 when Avignon was the seat of the Avignon Papacy. Though the lifestyles of the papal courts could often be very luxurious, the Vatican account books of the daily alms given to the poor describe some of what lower class food in the region was like. The food that was handed out to the needing consisted mainly of bread, legumes, and some wine. These were occasionally supplemented with cheese, fish, olive oil and meat of low quality. Montpellier, located on in Languedoc only a few miles from the coast, was a major center for trade, education in medicine, and was famous for its espices de chamber or \\"parlor confections\\", a term for sweets such as candied aniseed and ginger. The confectionery from the town was so renowned that its market value was twice as high as that of similar products from other towns. Montpellier was also well known for its spices and the wines with which they were flavored, like the ubiquitous hypocras. Byzantine Empire The culinary traditions of Roman times lived on in the Byzantine empire. Inherited from Greek traditions was the use of olives and olive oil, wheat bread, and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or prepared with garós, the Greek term for garum, a sauce made out of fermented fish that was so popular that it more or less replaced salt as the common food flavoring. The Byzantine kitchen was also influenced by Arab cuisine from which it imported the use of eggplants and oranges. Seafood was very popular and included tuna, lobster, mussels, oysters, murena, and carp. Around the 11th century the habit of eating roe and caviar was also imported from the Black Sea region. Dairy products were consumed in the form of cheese (particularly feta), and nuts and fruits such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and apples. The choice of meats were lamb, and several wild animals like gazelles, wild asses, and suckling young in general. Meat was often salted, smoked or dried. Wine was popular, like elsewhere around the Mediterranean, and it was the drink of choice among the higher social classes, where sweet wines like Muscat or Madeira/Malmsey were popular. Among the lower classes, the common drink tended to be vinegar mixed with water. Like all Christian societies the Byzantines had to abide by the dietary restrictions of the church, which meant avoiding meats (and preferably general excesses) on Wednesdays and Fridays and during fast and Lent. The Byzantine empire also became quite famous for its desserts, which included biscuits, rice pudding, quince marmalade, rose sugar and many types of non-alcoholic beverages. The most common sweetener was honey, with sugar extracted from sugar cane being reserved for those who could afford it. The food of the lower classes was mostly vegetarian and limited to olives, fruit, onions, and the occasional piece of cheese, or stews made from cabbage and salted pork. The standard meal of a shoemaker was described in a Byzantine poem, one of the Prodromic Poems, as consisting of some cooked foods and an omelette followed by hot salted pork with an unspecified garlic dish.Dalby Notes References *Adamson, Melitta Weiss (2004) Food in Medieval Times *Adamson, Melitta Weiss, ed.

The title is a reference to a perfect game in the sport, in which a bowler scores 300 points. A two-player version of this four-player game was released as Top Score. Description Gottlieb sold this game design in the two varieties, though they are essentially exactly the same game (with slight artwork differences). The two-player version (Top Score) had a lower price than the four-player (\\"300\\"), and was targeted to game operators with a smaller budget. This game used animated backbox red (bowling) balls for the bonus unit. Two kickout holes, two pop bumpers, one spinner, one slingshots, and two 3\\" flippers. It has the same right side lane scoring as Gottlieb Sheriff pinball (1971), and similar left side score as Gottlieb Super Soccer. Only a couple Gottlieb pinball games made during the 1970s used a backbox animation. The game has the same mechanical backbox animation as Super Soccer pinball. They made 7925 Gottlieb \\"300\\" pinball machines, and 3200 Gottlieb Top Score pinball machines. Current Projects At the Institute of Control Engineering of the Helmut-Schmidt-University / University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, a Gottlieb 300 has been modified such that it can played by a computer. The ball is detected by a motion capture system and the flippers are operated by servo motors. The aim of the project is to investigate various strategies and algorithms for controlling the flippers with regard to the playing time and the point gain. A high repeat accuracy, with which the ball is shot up by the flippers, is thereby of central importance and at the same time the biggest challenge, since there are big tolerances with respect to the dynamic behavior due to the old electro-mechanical system.

Plot At the train station in Mayport, Florida, Paymaster Blair Kimball (Boise De Legge) arrives a day early. Dr. A. G. Maynard (Sam Jordan), the local dentist and Constable Jed Splivins (Lions Daniels) greet him, as pilot Finley Tucker (Harold Platts) looks on. Kimball is carrying $25,000 for the railroad payroll. Waiting with station master Thomas Sawtelle (George Colvin) in his office, Sawtelle's daughter Ruth (Kathryn Boyd) comes with her father's lunch. When she sees Finley, she asks for a ride in his new aircraft. After the flight, he proposes for the 100th time, but Ruth says she is not certain she loves him. Captain Billy Stokes (Laurence Criner), a World War I fighter pilot, known as \\"The Flying Ace\\" because of his downing of seven enemy aircraft in France, returns home to resume his former job as a railroad detective. General manager Howard MacAndrews (R.L. Brown) assigns Stokes to find Kimball, who has gone missing along with the $25,000 company payroll, and apprehend a gang of railroad thieves. Stokes suspects that Finley is to blame, which is confirmed when he finds Kimball alive and hidden in the tail of Finley's plane. With the help of Peg (Steve Reynolds), Stokes identifies Constable Splivins as a member of Finley's gang, and arrests him. A desperate and crazed Finley flies off with Ruth, whom he has drugged. Stokes chases Finley in his own aircraft but is afraid for Ruth's safety. Shaking his captive and reviving her, Finley says Ruth has to kiss him, or \\"get out and walk on a cloud.\\" Suddenly, Finley's aircraft catches fire but Stokes is nearby, dropping a rope ladder to Ruth, who climbs into Stokes' aircraft. Failing to put out the fire, Finley dons a parachute and jumps safely, only to be arrested on the ground. After her ordeal, Stokes comforts Ruth, and makes his feelings about her known.

The term is also used to refer to the process of reproduction via spores. Reproductive spores were found to be formed in eukaryotic organisms, such as plants, algae and fungi, during their normal reproductive life cycle. Dormant spores are formed, for example by certain fungi and algae, primarily in response to unfavorable growing conditions. Most eukaryotic spores are haploid and form through cell division, though some types are diploid or dikaryons and form through cell fusion.  Reproduction via spores  Reproductive spores are generally the result of cell division, most commonly meiosis (e.g. in plant sporophytes). Sporic meiosis is needed to complete the sexual life cycle of the organisms using it. In some cases, sporogenesis occurs via mitosis (e.g. in some fungi and algae). Mitotic sporogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction. Examples are the conidial fungi Aspergillus and Penicillium, for which mitospore formation appears to be the primary mode of reproduction. Other fungi, such as ascomycetes, utilize both mitotic and meiotic spores. The red alga Polysiphonia alternates between mitotic and meiotic sporogenesis and both processes are required to complete its complex reproductive life cycle. In the case of dormant spores in eukaryotes, sporogenesis often occurs as a result of fertilization or karyogamy forming a diploid spore equivalent to a zygote. Therefore, zygospores are the result of sexual reproduction. Reproduction via spores involves the spreading of the spores by water or air. Algae and some fungi (chytrids) often use motile zoospores that can swim to new locations before developing into sessile organisms. Airborne spores are obvious in fungi, for example when they are released from puffballs. Other fungi have more active spore dispersal mechanisms. For example, the fungus Pilobolus can shoot its sporangia towards light. Plant spores designed for dispersal are also referred to as diaspores. Plant spores are most obvious in the reproduction of ferns and mosses. However, they also exist in flowering plants where they develop hidden inside the flower. For example, the pollen grains of flowering plants develop out of microspores produced in the anthers. Reproductive spores grow into multicellular haploid individuals or sporelings. In heterosporous organisms, two types of spores exist: microspores give rise to males and megaspores to females. In homosporous organisms, all spores look alike and grow into individuals carrying reproductive parts of both genders.  Formation of reproductive spores  Sporogenesis occurs in reproductive structures termed sporangia. The process involves sporogenous cells (sporocytes, also called spore mother cells) undergoing cell division to give rise to spores. In meiotic sporogenesis, a diploid spore mother cell within the sporangium undergoes meiosis, producing a tetrad of haploid spores. In organisms that are heterosporous, two types of spores occur: Microsporangia produce male microspores, and megasporangia produce female megaspores. In megasporogenesis, often three of the four spores degenerate after meiosis, whereas in microsporogenesis all four microspores survive. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, microspores are produced through meiosis from microsporocytes in microstrobili or male cones. In flowering plants, microspores are produced in the anthers of flowers. Each anther contains four pollen sacs, which contain the microsporocytes. After meiosis, each microspore undergoes mitotic cell division, giving rise to multicellular pollen grains (six nuclei in gymnosperms, three nuclei in flowering plants). Megasporogenesis occurs in megastrobili in conifers (for example a pine cone) and inside the ovule in the flowers of flowering plants. A megasporocyte inside a megasporangium or ovule undergoes meiosis, producing four megaspores. Only one is a functional megaspore whereas the others stay dysfunctional or degenerate. The megaspore undergoes several mitotic divisions to develop into a female gametophyte (for example the seven-cell/eight-nuclei embryo sac in flowering plants). = Mitospore formation = Some fungi and algae produce mitospores through mitotic cell division within a sporangium. In fungi, such mitospores are referred to as conidia.  Formation of dormant spores  Some algae, and fungi form resting spores made to survive unfavorable conditions. Typically, changes in the environment from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions will trigger a switch from asexual reproduction to sexual reproduction in these organisms. The resulting spores are protected through the formation of a thick cell wall and can withstand harsh conditions such as drought or extreme temperatures. Examples are chlamydospores, teliospores, zygospores, and myxospores. Similar survival structures produced in some bacteria are known as endospores. = Chlamydospore and teliospore formation = Chlamydospores are generally multicellular, asexual structures. Teliospores are a form of chlamydospore produced through the fusion of cells or hyphae where the nuclei of the fused cells stay separate. These nuclei undergo karyogamy and meiosis upon germination of the spore. = Zygospore, oospore and auxospore formation = Zygospores are formed in certain fungi (zygomycota, for example Rhizopus) and some algae (for example Chlamydomonas). The zygospore forms through the isogamic fusion of two cells (motile single cells in Chlamydomonas) or sexual conjugation between two hyphae (in zygomycota). Plasmogamy is followed by karyogamy, therefore zygospores are diploid (zygotes). They will undergo zygotic meiosis upon germinating. In oomycetes, the zygote forms through the fertilization of an egg cell with a sperm nucleus and enters a resting stage as a diploid, thick-walled oospore. The germinating oospore undergoes mitosis and gives rise to diploid hyphae which reproduce asexually via mitotic zoospores as long as conditions are favorable. In diatoms, fertilization gives rise to a zygote termed auxospore. Besides sexual reproduction and as a resting stage, the function of an auxospore is the restoration of the original cell size, as diatoms get progressively smaller during mitotic cell division. Auxospores divide by mitosis. = Endospore formation = The term sporogenesis can also refer to endospore formation in bacteria, which allows the cells to survive unfavorable conditions. Endospores are not reproductive structures and their formation does not require cell fusion or division. Instead, they form through the production of an encapsulating spore coat within the spore-forming cell.  Parts of the spore  There are many parts of the spore 'plant'. The case that holds all the spores is called a sporangium.  Bibliography  *S.S. Mader (2007): Biology, 9th edition, McGraw Hill Companies, New York, *P.H. Raven, R.F. Evert, S.E.

A. Hansom, the creator of the Hansom cab, and had formerly done the village church at Hanley Swan. The brothers also prepared designs for Woodchester Mansion in Nympsfield, Gloucestershire, after A. W. N. Pugin had resigned from the project. For this reason, they are often quoted as being the second best Roman Catholic architects of their day, for their success in picking up commissions Pugin had passed over. Woodchester Mansion's north service wing was also designed by them in the same Gothic style. The walls are of Bath stone. The church's spire was added by Hansom in 1867. The baptistery, a shrine containing the relics of Saint Justina of Padua, was designed by Edward Joseph Hansom, his son, in 1871. The brothers considered the church to be one of their best works. Pevsner's typical terse description describes the church as follows: History Interior of the church The church was put up by the Benedictines based at Downside Abbey, which accounts for the substantial ancillary buildings intended to accommodate a small community of priests. It was handed over to the Diocese of Clifton in 1932. The building was bombed in 1942: four people died and the south aisle was destroyed, but subsequently rebuilt in a similar Gothic style. The inscription commemorating this event is in Latin: \\"Hostili incursione diruta...\\".Martin, op. cit. p 105 The steeple provides a nest for a breeding pair of peregrine falcons. The nesting site is monitored by a publicly viewable webcam. Parish The parish lies within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton, and is one of four within the City of Bath. There are currently three priests, one a Pole who celebrates Mass in his own tongue each Sunday for the local Polish community. The parish priest, Fr. Christopher Whitehead celebrated twenty years of priestly ministry in 2019, and began as Parish Priest in September 2019.

He served as president pro tempore of the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan (now Michigan State University) from 1859 to 1862 and as president of Albion College from 1877 to 1898. Fiske sometimes spelled his name Fisk.From the MSU Archives: \\"A note on the spelling of Fiske's name: The correct spelling is Fiske, but for a period of his life that included his tenure at the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, he spelled it Fisk. He apparently did this to avoid confusion by some who thought Fiske was a misspelling of Fisher.\\" Biography Lewis Ransom Fiske was born in Penfield, New York, the sixth child of ten born to James and Eleanor (née Ransom) Fiske. The ancestors of the Fiske family left England to settle in Wenham, Massachusetts, in 1637. Lewis' father, James Fiske, was born in New Hampshire, August 4, 1788, and was a cousin to Levi Woodbury, a prominent politician from New Hampshire who served as a justice of the United States Supreme Court. The family moved to a farm in Coldwater, Michigan, in 1835. In the school year 1845–46, Fiske attended the Wesleyan Seminary of Albion (now Albion College). He went on to graduate in 1850 with an A.B. from the University of Michigan. He began to study law, but in the fall of 1850 accepted a position as professor of Natural Science at the Albion Female Collegiate Institute and Wesleyan Seminary. On September 19, 1852,The date of September 19 is from the MSU Archives. Barnard gives the date of their marriage as August 18. Fiske married Elizabeth Ross SpenceMSU Archives give the maiden name of Fiske's first wife as \\"Spencer\\", while several other sources give the name as \\"Spence\\". (d. February 25, 1879). Spence was the cousin of Scottish author and poet George MacDonald.See Barnard p. 36 In the summer of 1880 Fiske married Helen M. Davis of Detroit (d. 1896). Fiske had one daughter and one son with his first wifeBarnard, published in 1871 reports that Fiske had five sons and a daughter with Elizabeth. One of the sons had died by that date. and three sons with the second. In 1853, Fiske received an A.M. degree from the University of Michigan and also accepted a professorship at the Ypsilanti State Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University). In 1856, he became professor of Chemistry at the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan (now Michigan State University). He served as President pro tempore of the Agricultural College from 1859 to 1862 and also acted as the chaplain of the State Reform School in Lansing. In 1863, Fiske entered the ministry for the Methodist Episcopal Church, served as pastor of the Methodist Episcopal in Jackson, 1863–66; of the Central Methodist Episcopal Church in Detroit, 1866–69; and of the First Methodist Church in Ann Arbor, 1869–72. In 1872 he was the Presiding Elder of the Ann Arbor District. In 1873, he was awarded the D.D. from Albion College and returned for another three years to his former pastorate in Detroit. From 1876 to 1877, he was in charge of the Tabernacle Methodist Episcopal Church in Detroit. For some time, beginning in January 1875, he was editor of the Michigan Christian Advocate, the organ of Michigan Methodism. In 1877, Fiske became president of Albion College, in which position he remained for 22 years until his retirement in 1898. In 1878, he was honored with an LL.D. from the University of Michigan. He was elected six times as a delegate to the quadrennial general conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held respectively in Brooklyn, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Omaha, and Cleveland. Fiske was president of the State Teachers Association of Michigan in 1889. He was appointed a member of the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist Episcopal Church the met in Washington D.C., in October 1891. For sixteen years he was a trustee of the board of education of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Fisk published several works, among them: \\"Echos from College Platform\\", \\"Among the Professions\\", \\"Today and Tomorrow\\", \\"Choosing a Life-work\\", and Man Building: A Treatise on Human Life and Its Forces ().

Such systems share many properties with the conventional Rydberg atom and consequently are sometimes referred to as heavy Rydberg atoms. While such a system is a type of ionically bound molecule, it should not be confused with a molecular Rydberg state, which is simply a molecule with one or more highly excited electrons. The peculiar properties of the Rydberg atom come from the large charge separation and the resulting hydrogenic potential. The extremely large separation between the two components of a heavy Rydberg system results in an almost perfect 1/r hydrogenic potential seen by each ion. The positive ion can be viewed as analogous to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, with the negative ion playing the role of the electron.  Species  The most commonly studied system to date is the H^+/H^- system, consisting of a proton bound with a H^- ion. The H^+/H^- system was first observed in 2000 by a group at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The formation of the H^- ion can be understood classically; as the single electron in a hydrogen atom cannot fully shield the positively charged nucleus, another electron brought into close proximity will feel an attractive force. While this classical description is nice for getting a feel for the interactions involved, it is an oversimplification; many other atoms have a greater electron affinity than hydrogen. In general the process of forming a negative ion is driven by the filling of atomic electron shells to form a lower energy configuration. Only a small number of molecules have been used to produce heavy Rydberg systems although in principle any atom with a positive electron affinity can bind with a positive ion. Species used include O_2, H_2S and HF. Fluorine and oxygen are particularly favoured due to their high electron affinity, high ionisation energy and consequently high electronegativity.  Production The difficulty in the production of heavy Rydberg systems arises in finding an energetic pathway by which a molecule can be excited with just the right energy to form an ion pair, without sufficient internal energy to cause autodissociation (a process analogous to autoionization in atoms) or rapid dissociation due to collisions or local fields. Currently production of heavy Rydberg systems relies on complex vacuum ultra-violet (so called because it is strongly absorbed in air and requires the entire system to be enclosed within a vacuum chamber) or multi-photon transitions (relying on absorption of multiple photons almost simultaneously), both of which are rather inefficient and result in systems with high internal energy.  Features  The bond length in a heavy Rydberg system is 10,000 times larger than in a typical diatomic molecule. As well as producing the characteristic hydrogen-like behaviour, this also makes them extremely sensitive to perturbation by external electric and magnetic fields. Heavy Rydberg systems have a relatively large reduced mass, given by: :: \\\\mu = {m_1m_2 \\\\over m_1+m_2} This leads to a very slow time evolution, which makes them easy to manipulate both spatially and energetically, while their low binding energy makes them relatively simple to detect through field dissociation and detection of the resulting ions, in a process known as threshold ion-pair production spectroscopy. Kepler's third law states that the period of an orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis; this can be applied to the Coulomb force: :: \\\\tau^2 = {4\\\\pi^2\\\\mu \\\\over kZe^2}a^3 where \\\\tau is the time-period, \\\\mu is the reduced mass, a is the semi-major axis and k = 1/(4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0). Classically we can say that a system with a large reduced mass has a long orbital period. Quantum mechanically, a large reduced mass in a system leads to narrow spacing of the energy levels and the rate of time-evolution of the wavefunction depends on this energy spacing. This slow time-evolution makes heavy Rydberg systems ideal for experimentally probing the dynamics of quantum systems.

Career He was born of a Roman Catholic family in York. He was the brother of Joseph Aloysius Hansom, architect and creator of the Hansom cab, and father of the architect Edward Joseph Hansom. He practised in partnership with his brother, Joseph, in London from 1854. This partnership was dissolved in 1859 when Charles established an independent practice in Bath with his son Edward (born 22 October 1842) as an articled clerk. He took his son into partnership in 1867, by which time the practice had moved to Bristol, with a large West Country practice of church and collegiate architecture. In Bristol he took on Benjamin Bucknall as an assistant. Clifton College Clifton College's School House and Big School soon after they were built in the 1860s The original Clifton College buildings were all designed by Hansom. His first design at Clifton was for Big School (then a meeting hall and now the school canteen) and a proposed dining hall. Only the former was actually built and a small extra short wing was added in 1866. This is what now contains the Marshal's office and the new staircase into Big School. Hansom was called back to the College in the 1870s and asked to design what is now the Percival Library and the open-cloister classrooms. This project was undertaken in two stages and largely completed by 1875, although the Wilson Tower was not built until 1890.

She is the great-great-granddaughter of Charles and Emma Darwin. Biography Darwin was born and brought up in London. Her father was Henry Galton Darwin, a lawyer in the Foreign Office, son of Sir Charles Galton Darwin, grandson of Sir George Darwin, and great-grandson of Charles Darwin. Her mother Jane (née Christie), an English teacher, was the younger daughter of John Traill Christie. Darwin has two sisters; Carola and Sophia. Due to the parents' work, the family spent three years commuting between London and Brussels. The family spent many holidays on the Essex/Suffolk border, where much of her novel The Mathematics of Love is set. Darwin has lamented that any reviews of her work inevitably include references to her family background. She read Drama at the University of Birmingham, and she spent some years in academic publishing. But when she had two small children, she started writing again, and eventually earned an MPhil in Writing at the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales), where her tutor was novelist and poet Christopher Meredith. The novel she wrote for the degree became The Mathematics of Love, which was sold to Headline Review, as the first of a two- book deal. Meanwhile, she had found the form of a research degree so fruitful that she completed a PhD in Creative Writing at Goldsmiths' College in 2010, where her supervisor was Maura Dooley. Darwin now lives with her children in South East London. The Mathematics of Love was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Best First Book Award for the Europe and South Asia region.Commonwealth Writers Award Shortlist In 2006, her short story Maura's Arm as awarded 3rd place in the Bridport Prize.

Dame Eileen Louise Younghusband, DBE (1 January 1902 – 22 May 1981) was internationally known for her research and teaching in the field of social work.  Early life  Her father was Sir Francis Younghusband (1863–1942), a British explorer and mystic famous for his discoveries in Central Asia and his leadership of the British Tibet campaign of 1903–04. She was a student at the London School of Economics 1926–29, and a member of staff 1944–58.Eileen Younghusband profile, lse.ac.uk; accessed 26 April 2014.  Professional contributions  In her Carnegie Reports of 1947 and 1950 she advocated \\"generic\\" training – a set of core knowledge common to all social workers. In 1954 she pioneered the teaching of a generic course that was to become the prototype of professional social work training in other universities.*Profile , socwork.net; accessed 26 April 2014. In 1955 she chaired a Ministry of Health working party on the provision of training for social workers, a rapidly expanding profession but with little opportunity for formal training. The subsequent Younghusband Report, which was published in May 1959, led to the establishment of the Council for Training in Social Work. This council was responsible for validating courses at polytechnics and further education institutions primarily for entrants to local authority health and welfare departments, issuing a Certificate in Social Work to those successfully completing such a course. During the 1960s, Younghusband served as a Committee Member of the Council for Training in Social Work.Second Report of The Council for Training in Social Work, 1962-1964\\"; Kendal Archive, WC/W/A1568/Box 19/W/6/4 In 1968 Younghusband chaired the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's report, Community Work and Social Change. Honours She was appointed MBE in 1946, CBE in 1955, and DBE in 1964. Eileen Younghusband was also active at an international level, initially through the British Council and the UN, and from 1950 through the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW), initially as board member and from 1961 onwards as (honorary) president. She made it her task to promote high standards of social work education across the globe. She is still honoured by the IASSW through the biennial Eileen Younghusband memorial lectures (inaugurated 1984) at the global IASSW conference, when a current social work educator is invited to speak at the IASSW conference on a topic of relevance to international social work. Death Younghusband died in 1981, in a car accident in Raleigh, North Carolina, while on a lecture tour in the United States; she was 79 years old.

Apartments and homes near the big cities rose especially fast. Some of the rise can be attributed to falling interest rates, the introduction of new loan types (such as interest-only mortgages), improving economy and increasing urbanisation, higher wages along with other factors. Some observers have also noted increased interest in homes and a dramatic increase in the number of TV programs regarding home decoration, home sales, gardening etc. The increasing number of parents buying apartments for their children is also an important factor, dramatically increasing the demand on smaller apartments, typically 2 - 3 rooms, thus giving rising prices from the lower segment of apartments. However, many banks and analysts acknowledge that prices have increased more than can be explained by their models even when taking the economic factors into account and that homes have indeed become less affordable. In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult for first- time buyers to enter the market, and they now make up a historically low fraction of all buyers. This has led some observers to speculate that the Danish real estate market may be in a bubble where price increases have been fueled by speculation beyond what can be justified by fundamental economics. Some have warned that the market may be in for a correction, i.e., major price decreases. Still, as of March 2007, this has not occurred. Apartments in Copenhagen have fallen 7% in the first quarter of 2007 and the supply is still rising. However, there are signs that the market is softening and prices have fallen in some areas. In 2006, the number of homes for sale increased dramatically, tripling in some areas. It was estimated that 10% of all apartments in Copenhagen are for sale. The total inventory of homes for sale totaled more than one average year of home sales. In the statistics for the fourth quarter 2006, some areas experienced a quarter-to-quarter price fall around 4-5%, the first significant fall in over a decade. Two of the major real estate agencies claim they are observing price falls, with the biggest agency (Home) claiming to have observed falls since July 2006 The softening comes at a time when there has been an explosion in the building of new apartments and homes all around in the country. In Copenhagen alone, as many as 2,000 new apartments are expected to be added to the inventory during 2007. *Denmark 2007 - -12% Recent history of the Danish residential property market, Global Property Guide References  External links  * Core Economics animated Real Estate Rollercoaster Ride Category:Economic history of Denmark Category:Economy of Denmark Category:Real estate bubbles of the 2000s ","title":"Danish property bubble of 2000s"},{"id":"9798975","title":"List of largest employers"},{"id":"9798976","text":"Pontes (Latin for \\"bridges\\") may refer to: * Pontes, the Roman fort beside Trajan's Bridge over the Danube * Pontes, the Roman name for Staines in Britain, where major bridges crossed the Thames as part of the Devil's Highway ","title":"Pontes"},{"id":"9798977","text":"Niloak \\"Mission Swirl\\" vase in unglazed stoneware, c. 1900. Niloak is a line of American art pottery produced by the Eagle Pottery Company of Benton, Arkansas. Eagle was founded by Charles Dean Hyten and his brothers in the 1890s and was the largest pottery-ware business in the Benton area by 1904. The name is the reverse spelling of kaolin the main ingredient of porcelain. In 1909, Arthur Dovey joined Eagle to help Hyten, by then sole owner of the company, develop an operation for the manufacture of art pottery. Together they produced the Niloak product, the name taken from kaolin spelled backwards. The company was in business from 1909 to 1946. The salient feature of Niloak was its \\"Mission Swirl,\\" developed by Hyten. The swirl is a multi- colored pattern using different clays and resembling marbled paper. Niloak's Mission Swirl was usually of red, tan, blue and brown in a counter-clockwise direction. During the Depression years, Eagle manufactured a line of Niloak called \\"Hywood\\".

It was a joint venture between Yahoo!7 and Telecom New Zealand (now Spark). Yahoo!7 held a 51 percent stake in the company and Telecom NZ held 49 percent. Because Yahoo!7 is a 50/50 venture, Yahoo! proper was therefore a 25.5% owner of Yahoo!Xtra. Telecom announced in April 2011 that it had sold its share to Yahoo!7 and Yahoo!Xtra was rebranded as Yahoo! New Zealand.  XtraMSN  Telecom launched internet service provider Xtra in 1996, which is New Zealand's largest ISP (). In 2001 Telecom partnered with MSN to create the web portal XtraMSN, which by 2006 was receiving over 100 million total page impressions per month. Visitor numbers to XtraMSN grew by 45 percent in its last two years and the website attracted more than 3 million unique browsers per month.  Move to Yahoo  In December 2006, Telecom made a new agreement, founding a joint venture with Australia's Yahoo!7 – itself a joint company between the Seven Network and Yahoo! – to form Yahoo!Xtra. The six-year-old Telecom and Microsoft portal ended on 1 March 2007, with the users invited to go to either YahooXtra.co.nz or Msn.co.nz. Telecom reportedly left the content management of the portal to Yahoo!, who operate an Auckland-based office consisting of Sales, Marketing, Ad Operations, Production and Finance Departments. The Editorial team manages local news, sport and entertainment content. When Telecom sold out in 2011, Yahoo!Xtra staff transferred to Yahoo! New Zealand. Telecom noted that Yahoo!7 would continue to support Telecom’s broadband customers. Yahoo! continued to provide Telecom's email service, which came under criticism in early 2013 following a spam and phishing attack described as the biggest to have ever hit New Zealand. Telecom automatically reset thousands of users' passwords. In April, Telecom announced that despite the issue, it would keep Yahoo! on as an email provider.  Move of Xtra Mail from Yahoo! to spark.co.nz  Between September 2016 and April 2017 Spark New Zealand migrated Xtra Mail from Yahoo! to spark.co.nz. Spark partnered with New Zealand email provider SMX.  People  The Yahoo!Xtra's board of directors is chaired by the Yahoo!7 CEO, Rohan Lund, and consisted of the following members: * Alan Gourdie, Telecom, CEO Telecom Retail * Ralph Brayham, Telecom, Director, Telecom Home * Rod Snodgrass, Telecom, GM, Group Strategy * Greg Brown, Yahoo!7, CFO * David Gowdey, Yahoo!, Director Corporate Development In April 2007, Kevin Bowler was appointed as the Auckland-based CEO of Yahoo!Xtra, but departed the business in early 2010.  Promotion  Yahoo!Xtra's 'X meets Y' promotion at launch featured a television commercial with Regina Spektor's song \\"Fidelity\\" playing whilst a young couple undertake in a lingering kiss. This helped throw the anti-folk star under the spotlight in the New Zealand music scene, \\"Fidelity\\" becoming a hit single and one of Spektor's most successful tracks.Yahoo!Xtra Music  Notes and references   External links  * Yahoo!

It is the first Super Robot Wars game released for the Nintendo DS. Like some DS games, special features can be unlocked by starting a new game with any of the Game Boy Advance era games inserted into SLOT 2. Story Space Calendar (SC) 99. In the previous age, the governments of Earth formed the Federated Earth Nation (FEN) to bring World War III to an end. After putting down the defiant lunar colony, the Federation Space Calendar was instituted. To alleviate environmental pressures and overpopulation, the FEN began expanding into space, constructing space colonies and asteroid cities, as well as an Orbital Space Ring around the Earth, and the development and terraforming of the Moon and Mars. This was accomplished in a short time, due to quantum leaps in physics and energy research. But repression of those living in the colonies by the FEN ignited a war between factions in space, and OZ, the true leaders of the FEN. This \\"Revolutionary War\\" ended in the year 98, with the death of FEN President Treize Khushrenada. From Treize's will, a New United Nations was formed, returning power back to the individual states. But the new Earth Sphere's troubles seemed to multiply. The Earth Sphere was invaded by the Radam, who seized control of the Orbital Space Ring, and the invaders known as the Jovian Lizards, who destroyed the Mars Colony. In addition, internal strife, such as the arbitrary distinction between Coordinators and Naturals, and mechanized terrorism, seem to be taking the New United Nations to the breaking point. On June 13, SC 99, Kazuma Ardygun and his family, a group of Trailers, are tasked with the job of escorting Quatre Raberba Winner and Duo Maxwell, disguised as \\"Heero Yuy\\", to Earth... Banpresto Originals =Main Characters= *Kazuma Ardygun **At 16 years of age, Kazuma is the Ardygun family's only son and protagonist of the game. Very sloppy and rash in his decisions, his goal is to become a great Trailer like his father, Blessfield, known as the \\"legendary Trailer\\". On his father's request, he writes in a journal everyday, recording all of the events that have transpired. He is the main pilot behind the Valhawk mobile unit. **After Blessfield sacrifices himself in a battle, the weight of depression and shock of the event forces Kazuma to leave the family. He winds up with the Serpent Tail mercenary group, going by the name of \\"Kite\\". A year later, he reunites with the rest of the Ardygun family, and proceeds to battle against the antagonist Database. *Mihiro Ardygun **The youngest daughter in the Ardygun family, 10-year-old Mihiro supports her brother, Kazuma, on the battlefield by serving as the secondary pilot in the Valhawk, controlling the aiming and evasive programs. After Kazuma disappears when their father dies, she takes over the piloting responsibilities on the Valhawk; once Kazuma returns, she becomes the co-pilot again. *Blessfield Ardygun **Patriarch to the Ardygun family, 45-year-old Blessfield is known the \\"legendary Trailer\\", having earned the nickname \\"Hawk's Eye\\". Serving as the captain of the family's battleship Valstork, he has several friends in high places from a variety of organizations. Blessfield was originally a space pirate, who carried out his own sense of justice, but settled down once he met his future wife Yūmi and became a Trailer. **Blessfield carries an innate ability called Boson Jump (an ability derived from the Martian Successor Nadesico series), allowing him to instantaneously travel backwards through time; unfortunately, jumping forward through time is impossible, as the future has yet to exist. During a major battle, he protects Kazuma from an imminent explosion, and safely avoids it by instantly jumping back 15 billion years into the past. Blessfield almost loses hope, until meeting an ancient civilization called the E's, teaching him the importance of memories. Working alongside them, he creates the Knowledge Records and Record Plant, bringing the Database to life. The Valstork battleship is made at the same time, thus establishing his legacy, to be eventually handed down to his descendants in the future, 15 billion years later. *Shihomi Ardygun **The oldest daughter in the Ardygun family, 22-year-old Shihomi is aware of her duties as the eldest child. She serves as the main operator aboard the Valstork. After Blessfield's disappearance, she becomes the captain of the battleship and head of the family. *Akane Ardygun **The second oldest daughter in the Ardygun family, 20-year-old Akane is a rather cheerful, but stern woman. She serves as the weapons operator aboard the Valstork. According to her, she prefers a tough man, and her gullible personality makes her an easy target for Horis Horian's teasing. She's also troubled about her chest size, something Horis constantly jokes about. She also happens to be a fan of Uppo-kun, the mascot at the Wateropolis amusement park *Horis Horian **24-year-old Horis is currently employed by the Ardygun family. Very knowledgeable about many things, he serves as the navigational operator aboard the Valstork and has excellent control over the battleship. Formerly an intelligence agent from OZ, he infiltrated aboard the Valstork to investigate its technology and capabilities, but decided to stay, due to the growing attachment he had towards the Ardyguns and how nice they treated him. *Carret **This general- purpose robot acts as the communications and signal analysis officer aboard the Valstork and Valhawk. Carret's appearance is perhaps modeled after the mascots of the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise, Haro =Antagonists= *Aria Advance **With an appearance of a 16-year-old, Aria is one of the frontline commanders of the Database, piloting the customized Arm Arcus machine. She considers Applicant her father, usually addressing him as \\"papa\\". Because of the mechanical ways the Database operates, she is very ignorant on the subject of relationships, though she is oddly fond of Mihiro during their encounters, but extremely cold towards Kazuma. *Regulate (レギュレイト) **The program Regulate acts as an enforcer, and has a mother-like personality. Whenever Applicant goes to fight in the frontlines, she is sent alongside to support him. She bears an odd resemblance to Yūmi, Blessfield's deceased wife. *Applicant (アプリカント) **The program Applicant is in charge of managing throughout the Database. The pilot of the Arm Stora battleship, he acts as the parent to Aria. *Inference (インファレンス) **The commander of the Record Plant, Inference is the leader behind the Database, piloting the giant Scentia. Usually calm, though has the tendency to act irrational when angered, he bears some resemblance to both Kazuma and Aria. *Critic (クリティック) **He endorses Inference's actions and is also a member of the Database. Because his personality clashes with his position in the Database, he has been suspected by other members to have ulterior motives. =Original Mecha= *Valhawk **A transformable machine piloted by two people. Its main mode is called the \\"Cross Combat Mode\\" and this is its default mode. It also has a high speed flight mode \\"Air Force Mode\\". Its main source of power is a Proton Drive and is capable of combining with the Valstork using a battle formation called \\"Pattern Cross\\" . **It was created by Blessfield after he was sent 15 billion years into the past. It was produced after blueprints hidden in the Valstork were found. *Valstork **A mysterious battleship Blessfield inherits from his father and used by the Ardygun family. Its main source of power is a Proton Drive and is capable of combining with the Valhawk using a battle formation called \\"Pattern Cross\\". It was created by Blessfield after he was sent 15 billion years into the past. *Valguard **The result of the combination of the Valhawk and the Valstork, after initiating a battle formation called \\"Pattern Cross\\". Kazuma takes over the main controls and is the main pilot. It's able to combine with the Arm Arcus and Arm Stora after initiating a battle formation called \\"Pattern Final\\". *Arm Arcus **Aria's personal machine. It is able to combine with the Valguard and the Arm Stora after initiating a battle formation called \\"Pattern Final\\". *Arm Stora **A ship powered by a Proton Nova Drive, it is able to combine with the Valguard and the Arm Arcus after initiating a battle formation called \\"Pattern Final\\". *Valzacard **The result of the combination of the Valguard, the Arm Stora, and the Arm Arcus, after initiating a battle formation called \\"Pattern Final\\". Kazuma takes over the main controls, and is the main pilot for the Valzacard. Towering at 212.7m, the Valzacard is the biggest leading mecha in \\"Banpresto Original\\" history.

The only characters from a pre-1980s series to appear are the Getter team, piloting the Shin Getter as they did in the 1990s manga. This game also marks the second Super Robot Wars title not to feature any Universal Century Gundam series, the first of which being Super Robot Wars J. It is also the first in the franchise which features no series produced by veteran anime director Yoshiyuki Tomino.However, all Gundam titles always credit Tomino, even if he is not the one directing it. It was also the first game in the series in which every series included had been licensed, in whole or in part, in North America at the time of the game's own release. Gameplay Unlike previous games, the interface is changed slightly to make use of the Nintendo DS's dual screens. While the player may still use the directional pad and buttons, the game also allows for the use of the touch screen stylus. The mini-map feature in previous titles is now fixed on the DS's top screen. When two units engage in battle, the battle sequence is shown on the top screen, while the bottom screen shows a quick summary of the stats of both units, including hit percentages. The screens may be swapped via the system menu. The game includes the \\"Combo Attack\\" system from previous Super Robot Wars titles for the Game Boy Advance. Unlike the system in those games, however, the attacker does not need to target units lined up in a row; instead, all units standing adjacent to one another are applicable, with the maximum number being determined by the pilot's Combo Attack level. An additional \\"Bazaar Shop\\", similar to the one seen in Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden, is unlockable after completing certain requirements. This shop allows players to buy a selection of units that normally only enemies use. Lastly, the \\"Favorites Series\\" system, introduced in Super Robot Wars MX, returns. Super Robot Wars W also adds the \\"Support Request\\" ability, working similar to the \\"Support Attack/Defense\\" system, but allows one unit to call in a supporting attack/defense from a unit held in reserve, but not already sortied into the battlefield. Support Request can only be used once per scenario for each time the pilot has the ability. Debuting with Super Robot Wars W is the \\"Double Slot System\\". When a player goes to the intermission screen (either by completing a stage or loading a saved game) with one of the Game Boy Advance Super Robot Wars games in the DS's \\"SLOT 2\\", a bonus item and extra credits are rewarded. The properties of the item vary depending on which game is used, and are named after the game they are from. One noticeable change in the plot is the story in Super Robot Wars W is separated into two timelines, allowing some of the series (like Nadesico, GaoGaiGar, Tekkaman Blade, Full Metal Panic) to continue in their respective sequels. The Gundam SEED storyline only exists in the second part, even though some characters appear in the first half.

Couette is best known for his contributions to rheology and the theory of fluid flow. He designed a concentric cylinder viscometer that he used to accurately measure the viscosity of fluids. The laminar flow observed in the gap between the two cylinders is known as Couette flow. He studied the boundary conditions of a fluid and showed that the \\"no slip\\" condition was satisfied for the fluids and wall materials tested.  Early life and Career  Couette was born in Tours, France, as the only child of Alfred Ernest Couette, a cloth merchant. Finishing his education with the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes he obtained a baccalauréat in humanities and in science, both in 1874, as well as bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physical science (delivered by the Faculté de Science in Poitiers) in 1877 and 1879 respectively. Following a short spell as a lecturer in Angers, he joined the 12th Artillery Regiment at Vincennes for one year of voluntary military service. In 1881 he settled in Paris and enrolled in the Sorbonne, studying physical science in preparation for the agrégation, a French teaching diploma. Couette later taught in Arcueil and the École Sainte-Geneviève in Paris. At the Sorbonne he studied under Joseph Boussinesq and from 1887 onwards worked at the Physics Research Laboratory under Gabriel Lippmann( who would later receive the Nobel Prize in Physics). Couette also took his doctoral degree on the friction of liquids (\\"Studies on the Friction of Liquids\\", Etude sur le frottement des liquides, Gauthiers- Villars 1890). Soon afterwards he was given a professorship of physics at the Catholic University of Angers (now known as Université Catholique de l'Ouest) as well as other teaching commitments such as at the Free Faculty of Science, the School of Agriculture and several secondary schools in Angers. Couette was a member of the French Physics Society and retired in 1933. Accolades Since 1993, the Prix Maurice Couette is awarded by the Groupe français de Rhéologie.  Personal life  In 1886, Maurice Couette married Jeanne Jenny, who gave birth to eight children, five of whom reached adulthood.

He had also previously been a selector with the senior hurling team.HILL 16 Naughton had Andy Cunningham, Mick O'Riordan and Damien Byrne as his management team for Dublin. Managerial career =Dublin= 2006 After being appointed manager in late 2005, Naughton guided Dublin to the 2006 Division 2 National Hurling League. This title win ensured Dublin a place in Division One for 2007. The Liam MacCarthy Cup proved a difficult period for Naughton as his team failed to win a game in the competition until the relegation match against Westmeath. Dublin managed to retain their McCarthy Cup status for the 2007 season while Westmeath will play in the Christy Ring Cup for 2007. 2007 Naughton's 2007 season opened with a draw against Kilkenny in the 2007 National Hurling League. Naughton's Dublin kept their momentum by going on to defeat Galway in Parnell Park which his team in fourth position with one game in hand. Dublin then went on to continue there unbeaten run in the National Hurling League by defeating Limerick. That victory left Naughtons Dublin side in third position in the league with a game in hand over Antrim. Dublin lost the game against Antrim and then lost their final game against Tipperary which meant that Dublin missed their chance to qualify for the quarter finals or semi-finals. Naughton first match against Wexford was seen as the potential breakthrough match for Dublins young senior hurling team in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Dublin showed that the gap is lessening being themselves and the bigger teams but Wexford came out of the game with the one point win with a late point from Barry Lambert. Naughtons hurlers must now play in the qualifiers of the all-Ireland championship against Cork, Offaly and Limerick or Tipperary. The Dublin team were scheduled to play their first game against Cork in Parnell Park. Cork wrote a letter to the Competitions Control Committee to request that the game be played at a neutral venue, this was met with anger by both the Offaly and the Dublin managers who were playing at home on the first weekend of the qualifiers. A change of venue never materialised and Cork played Dublin in Parnell Park in a game which Cork won by 3-20 to 0-15.

INPO is funded entirely by the nuclear industry. Function INPO conducts plant evaluations at nuclear stations and identifies both strengths and areas for improvement that are intended to be shared with other nuclear stations as a method to share best practices and common weaknesses. The results of INPO plant evaluations are not shared with the public, and any related information shared within the nuclear industry does not typically include the name of the plant. INPO assigns a score between one and four to each nuclear site, following the evaluation, where an \\"INPO 1\\" is the most favorable score, and an \\"INPO 4\\" is an indicator of a nuclear station with significant operational problems. The INPO Advisory Council consists of leading experts from the nuclear industry, as well as others whose expertise is relevant to the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Advisory Council members have included Dr. Edgar H. Schein, a retired MIT professor who is widely credited with inventing the term \\"corporate culture;\\" and Dr. Rodger Dean Duncan, an organizational development and human performance expert. Retired U.S. Navy vice-admiral Eugene Parks Wilkinson, best known as the first commanding officer of the nuclear powered submarine USS Nautilus, was selected as INPO's first CEO, in 1980, and served in that position until 1984.

Life Born in Saint Petersburg to a German-Finnish mother and a father of French Huguenot ancestry, Pingoud was a pupil of the Russian composers Anton Rubinstein, Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He also took private lessons with Alexander Siloti, who had come to know the family when he became a neighbour of their summer residence at Tikkala Manor near Viipuri on the Karelian Isthmus. In 1906, he went to Germany to study with the music theorist Hugo Riemann and the composer Max Reger, who considered him one of his best pupils. Perhaps on his father's instructions, Pingoud also studied non-musical subjects, including philosophy and literature, as well as mining and metallurgy, at Jena, Munich, Bonn and Berlin. He chose to present a thesis on Goethe, which for some reason was never approved. In 1908, while still a student, Pingoud began a writing career by becoming musical correspondent for the St. Petersburger Zeitung; he held the post until 1911 and then subsequently contributed concert and opera reviews from St. Petersburg until 1914. After the revolution, Pingoud moved to Helsinki where he lived for the rest of his life except for brief periods spent in Turku and Berlin. Besides his composing, he contributed to several newspapers and worked as an administrator of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and as director of a concert agency. His first orchestral concert, held in Helsinki in 1918, heralded the arrival of a modernist musical aesthetic in Finland. The music shocked the audience, much like their counterparts at the notorious 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring in Paris. Stylistically, the works showed the influence of Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin and Claude Debussy. Hostility in Finland towards his music resulted in a string of pejorative labels, including \\"ultra-modernism\\" and even \\"musical Bolshevism\\", although his command of orchestration did eventually receive some critical acknowledgement. His open rejection of Finnish nationalism may have been responsible for some of the disapproval he encountered (unlike other Finnish composers of the time he avoided composing works inspired by the Kalevala). Pingoud committed suicide by throwing himself under a train in Helsinki in 1942. Style Pingoud's preferred mode of musical expression was orchestral, especially in symphonic poems following the example of Scriabin His three piano concertos seem to look more to the models of Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Although the concision of his Fünf Sonette has been compared to early works of the Second Viennese School, his musical language remained predominantly tonal. He made extensive use of the Prometheus chord and the octatonic collection. Recordings A CD containing some of Pingoud's symphonic poems has been recorded for Ondine by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo.

In either instance, the purpose of the microphone preamplifier is the same. A microphone preamplifier is a sound engineering device that prepares a microphone signal to be processed by other equipment. Microphone signals are often too weak to be transmitted to units such as mixing consoles and recording devices with adequate quality. Preamplifiers increase a microphone signal to line level (i.e. the level of signal strength required by such devices) by providing stable gain while preventing induced noise that would otherwise distort the signal.Ballou, 1987, pp. 506–507. For additional discussion of signal level, see Gain stage. A microphone preamplifier is colloquially called a microphone preamp, mic preamp, preamp (not to be confused with a control amplifier in high-fidelity reproduction equipment), mic pre and pre.  Technical details  The output voltage on a dynamic microphone may be very low, typically in the 1 to 100 microvolt range. A microphone preamplifier increases that level by up to 70 dB, to anywhere up to 10 volts. This stronger signal is used to drive equalization circuitry within an audio mixer, to drive external audio effects, and to sum with other signals to create an audio mix for audio recording or for live sound. Functions In addition to providing gain for the microphone signal, a microphone preamplifier as found in a sound mixer or as a discrete component typically also provides power to the microphone in the form of either 24 or 48 volt Phantom power.  In use  A microphone is a transducer and as such is the source of much of the coloration of an audio mix. Most audio engineers would assert that a microphone preamplifier also affects the sound quality of an audio mix. A preamplifier might load the microphone with low impedance, forcing the microphone to work harder and so change its tone quality. A preamplifier might add coloration by adding a different characteristic than the audio mixer's built-in preamplifiers. Some microphones, for example condensers, must be used in conjunction with an impedance matching preamplifier to function properly. Some preamplifiers exist as one part of a channel strip, which can include other kinds of audio recording devices such as compressors, equalization (EQ), noise gates, and enhancers.

It went into administration in November 2011. History In 1995 two organisations merged, the Further Education Unit – an agency on curriculum issues – and the Staff College, which trained staff in the further education sector. This new organisation was known as the Further Education Development Agency (FEDA). FEDA was then renamed the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) in November 2000 to reflect its widening remit across the learning and skills sector. LSDA’s programmes in research, training and consultancy continued as normal under the banner of the Learning and Skills Network. In 2006 LSDA’s policy and strategic work developed into the Quality Improvement Agency for Lifelong Learning (QIA), now known as the Learning and Skills Improvement Service (LSIS). LSDA's work went on to become an independent organisation - the Learning and Skills Network. On 28 March 2006 Learning and Skills Network registered as a UK charity (Registered No. 1113456) with the following stated objectives: 1\\\\. To promote the improvement, development and opportunities for development of the performance and skills of members of the teaching, management and other staff of the education, learning skills and children's services sectors in such a way that they are better able to be more effective and efficient in the development of the education, learning and skills of their pupils, students and other learners; and 2\\\\. To promote, encourage and develop education, learning and skills in the united kingdom and elsewhere, and in particular, by advising upon, developing and providing education, learning and skills courses, by providing flexible and innovative solutions to the education, learning and skills sector's demands and by facilitating the capability of people and organisations to provide support for learner development. After further business developments, acquiring a selection of UK training-specialist companies including e-learning solutions provider Learning Resources International in the process, and a re-brand in 2009, the organisation officially became LSN and operated across a multitude of sectors including further education, higher education, local authorities, schools, public services and the private sector, in the UK and internationally. In 2010, LSN entered into a joint venture with Oxford & Cherwell Valley College to take over ownership of Reading College, a further education college in Reading, Berkshire, UK, from then owners Thames Valley University (renamed University of West London in 2011). LSN went into administration in November 2011. Post administration some of the purchased companies were re-acquired by their previous owners, including Learning Resources International, which has re-branded and repositioned itself as an all-in-one e-learning solutions provider for training providers and learning and development professionals.

He played college football at Duquesne University and was drafted in the 11th round of the 1942 NFL Draft. Life and career DeMao was born in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. He attended Duquesne University, graduating in 1942. He was a member of the university's undefeated 1941 football team, played in the 1941 Blue-Gray Game, and played in the 1941 College All-Star Game. Drafted by the Washington Redskins, he was unable to serve because he was drafted by the United States Navy instead. Commissioned a lieutenant, DeMao commanded a landing craft during the Normandy invasion, making nine dangerous trips to the beach to deliver soldiers to the shore. Discharged from the Navy in the fall of 1945, he joined the Redskins mid- season and played nine years for the team. He was a Pro Bowl player in 1950. Since most professional football players received only minimal pay in the 1950s, DeMao took up employment in the off-season with liquor distributor Milton S. Kronheim & Co. After retiring from football in 1954, DeMao remained with the company, rising to vice president of sales. DeMao remained active in NFL affairs in retirement. He founded the Redskins Alumni Association (a social and charitable organization for former Washington Redskins players) in 1957, NFL Alumni (a charitable organization to aid needy former NFL players) in 1967, and the Redskins Welcome Home Luncheon (a social event for players which kicks off each Redskins season). DeMao married Marcella DeMao, but the couple had no children. DeMao greatly enjoyed working with children, however. He was active in Special Olympics and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, assisted with the St. John's College High School football team, and coached football teams with the Boys Club of America and the Catholic Youth Organization. He also raised funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.

It refers to a residential street in Belfast Northern Ireland. In performance the song was a concert highlight and closer for years to come and would end with Morrison's command, \\"It's too late to stop now!\\" (a quotation from his song \\"Into the Mystic\\") as he stalked from the stage. A dynamic 10-minute version with the usual stop-start ending was included on his 1974 live album It's Too Late to Stop Now. Recording and composition Cyprus Avenue – the street in Belfast that inspired the song. Built on a basic blues structure with an unusual arrangement, the song was recorded at the Astral Weeks sessions on 25 September 1968, at Century Sound Studio with Lewis Merenstein as producer.Heylin, p. 518 The strings and harpsichord were overdubbed a month later. Calling it the central song of the album, Allmusic described it as \\"a chamber-music hybrid of folk-blues, jazz, and classical music, and over it Morrison sings a meditative memory lyric about his adolescence in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\\" On the Astral Weeks recording, Morrison's vocals are backed by his acoustic guitar, Richard Davis on acoustic bass, along with flute, harpsichord and strings. According to Roy Kane, who grew up with Morrison in Belfast, Cyprus Avenue \\"...was the street that we would all aspire to — the other side of the tracks ... the Beersbridge Road had the railway line cut across it; and our side of it was one side of the tracks and Cyprus Avenue was the other... there was an Italian shop up in Ballyhackamore, that's where all the young ones used to go of a Sunday... we used to walk up to the Sky Beam for an ice cream or a cup of mushy peas and vinegar... We used to take a short cut up Cyprus Avenue...\\"Heylin, p. 189 Morrison told biographer Ritchie Yorke that along with \\"Madame George\\" (which references Cyprus Avenue in the opening line) the song came to him in \\"a stream of consciousness thing\\", \\"Both those songs just came right out. I didn't even think about what I was writing.\\"Yorke, Into the Music, p. 61 As journalist Matthew Collin described the song: \\"Morrison reminisced about a more innocent time, recounting the sights and sounds of a bygone life while escaping into his imagination, an oasis of romantic reverie.\\" According to biographer Brian Hinton, \\"This is a song about being trapped, 'conquered in a car seat', and reduced to tortured silence, just like in (the song) 'T.B. Sheets'. The need for innocence in the earlier song is now equated to going crazy though the vision which then unfolds is out of time, and sexless. His dream lady in her antique carriage is only fourteen years old. Van's singing is totally possessed, moving from choked desire to exultation to hushed wonder.\\"Hinton, p. 96. Live performances Morrison often performed \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" in the 1970s, using it to close his concerts in many instances. Jon Landau wrote a Rolling Stone review in 1971 describing a performance at a concert he had attended: \\"For an encore Van offered 'Cyprus Avenue'. Working his way up to a ferocious conclusion, he stood before the audience shaking his head back and forth, hair falling about him, looking like a man insane. Finally, with tension mounting, he ran across the stage, ran back again, jumped over a microphone cord, held the mike up to his face and screamed, 'It’s too late to stop now', and was gone.\\" The intense live performances were said to be \\"clearly influenced by James Brown's stage theatrics\\" and in turn \\"influenced Bruce Springsteen, who used similar dynamics with his E Street Band shows.\\" A live version of it as performed in concert in the summer of 1973 is included on his 1974 live album It's Too Late to Stop Now. A live performance was again featured on Morrison's first video Van Morrison in Ireland, released in 1981. Forty years after it was first recorded, \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" was featured on Morrison's 2009 album Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl. On this live album, the song was placed as the sixth song instead of the fourth with some new additions in content entitled \\"You Came Walking Down\\".

For most of its history, it was a satellite of WWLP in Springfield. History =Location= WRLP came into existence because of the technical limitations UHF stations faced in the 1950s. The Springfield market was designated as an all-UHF market due to all of the possible VHF allocations being unavailable due to it being surrounded by allocations for Boston, Massachusetts/Manchester, New Hampshire (channels 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11), Hartford/New Haven (channels 3 and 8), Providence, Rhode Island (channels 6, 10 and 12) and the Capital District (Albany/Schenectady/Troy, channels 6, 10 and 13). This area is one of the most rugged in the Northeast, being dotted with small hills and mountains. Additionally, much of the population is within or just outside the winding valley of the Connecticut River. These factors made UHF reception difficult. Soon after WWLP signed on, the station's owners, the Putnam family, realized that much of the northern portion of the market in Franklin County northward—including Greenfield, Brattleboro, Vermont and Keene, New Hampshire—could not get an acceptable signal from WWLP. With cable still very much in its infancy, the Putnams decided to open WRLP as a full-time satellite of WWLP. Further compounding these reception problems, UHF stations could not be viewed without the use of an expensive external converter that received UHF signals (it wasn't until the passing of the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1962 that all TVs were required to have them built in). The station debuted on June 29, 1957. The station was named for Roger L. Putnam, former mayor of Springfield and father of WWLP founder William Putnam. The tower and transmitter was located on Gunn Mountain in Winchester, New Hampshire; one of the highest points in the region. The station could also be seen in Springfield as well, creating a strong combined signal with over 50% overlap. WRLP was originally slated to operate on channel 58, but Putnam sought and received permission to move to the stronger channel 32. WRLP was to be the \\"parent\\" of a network of low-powered translators across western New England. However, that plan came undone when the FCC rejected a proposed reallocation of channel allocations in New England that would have allowed the WRLP translators to air on channel 72. =Closure= For its first 17 years, WRLP was a money-bleeding full-time satellite of WWLP. However, in 1974, the Putnams and their company, Springfield Television, decided to air separate programming on WRLP in prime-time, including a fully separate newscast. It picked up Boston Bruins, Celtics and Red Sox telecasts, and soon appeared on cable systems across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut and upstate New York. At one point, 70% of the station's audience was on cable. Unfortunately, cable coverage was not factored in by advertisers at the time, so WRLP reaped almost no windfall from its large cable audience. The station continued to lose money. In a case of exceptionally bad timing, WSBK-TV in Boston (which originated the networks for the Bruins and Red Sox at the time) was uplinked to cable and satellite providers as a regional superstation, and WBZ-TV (the Celtics network flagship) was also made available to some systems in the region, effectively cutting out WRLP's carriage of those sports properties and reaping all the ad revenue on their own. After 20 years, the Putnams' patience with the station was exhausted, and WRLP went off the air on April 9, 1978 with almost no fanfare. Almost immediately afterward, the station's transmitter was dismantled and transported to Utah to start Springfield Television's newest station, KSTU in Salt Lake City that October. Pretty Soon, this station went back to the air as a translator for WSBK-TV that November.

The trains arrive from the south on the former CNoR tracks from Montreal; the train to Jonquière continues northeast along the former CNoR line; and the train to Senneterre heads northwest along the former NTR line. The trains combine here on the way back to Montreal. The current site of the station is located just opposite the chapel Hervey-Jonction, in the heart of the village since 2007. The previous site of the station was located about east along the former NTR line that connected Hervey-Junction to Quebec City. This section of railway ceased to be used in 2007 after 100 years of use. The first station was located on the CNoR line at the south of the village of Hervey Junction, near the boundary with Sainte-Thècle.

Characterisation Anwar is portrayed as a boy of Pakistani origin. Raised in an Islamic household, Anwar claims to pray five times a day. However, he does not take his religion seriously, as he takes drugs, drinks, partakes in premarital sex and eats pork. He even uses his being a Muslim to get out of certain situations. He is best friends with Maxxie Oliver, although his views on Maxxie's sexual orientation put a strain on their friendship at one point, as he believes that Maxxie's homosexuality goes against his religion. Anwar also laments that as a Muslim boy, he feels he has no choice in his faith. According to the official website, his favourite things are \\"tequila, dope, pills, Lupe Fiasco, breasts and X Factor\\".Channel 4 - Skins - Us According to fellow actors Mike Bailey (who portrays Sid Jenkins) and Hannah Murray (who portrays Cassie Ainsworth), the characterization of Anwar was partly based on the personality of the actor Dev Patel and the role was written specifically for him after he was cast for Skins. Character history =Series 1= In \\"Tony\\", Anwar and Chris are convinced by Maxxie to go to a \\"big gay night out\\" with him, believing that there would be many beautiful women there and they would be the only straight men there to shag. The night out didn't go as planned and they eventually go to Abigail Stock's party instead. In \\"Maxxie and Anwar\\", on a school trip to Russia, he finds himself at odds with Maxxie, who views Anwar's pick-and- choose approach to Islam as hypocritical. He also loses his virginity to a married Russian girl, Anka, whom he, along with Sid Jenkins, believed they were rescuing from her abusive father who turned out to be her husband. The beginning of the first series finale opens with the celebration of Anwar's 17th birthday and his upcoming party on the same day. Maxxie rings him to wish him a happy birthday, and tells Anwar to tell his parents that he is gay or he would not attend the party. Later that night, Anwar's party doesn't start off well, with his uncle playing old 70s and 80s music, and Maxxie refusing to attend the party. While making out with one of his sister's friends, Anwar stops to call Maxxie to introduce her to him. Anwar and Maxxie meet outside the venue, where Mr. Kharral, Anwar's father, spots them. As Mr. Kharral converses with Maxxie, Anwar blurts out that Maxxie is gay. Mr. Kharral seems to ignore this until Maxxie confesses to him mid conversation. Mr. Kharral, much to the surprise of Anwar and Maxxie, explains that homosexuals are something he does not understand, but would never discriminate against, as he has faith that God will one day enlighten him and make him understand. Mr. Kharral then invites Maxxie to come and eat, repairing the friendship between him and Anwar. =Series 2= Patel On The Stage in Skins Party 2007 In \\"Sketch\\", he sleeps with Sketch after Maxxie turns her down. Despite telling Anwar that she always liked him, Sketch still has feelings for Maxxie, as she touches and looks at a picture of him while she has sex with Anwar. In the next episode it is shown that he and Sketch are continuing their sexual relationship, implying that Anwar may be particularly interested in her. When the two are caught by Sid's Mum, Anwar once again expresses discomfort for his life under a Muslim household, stating that \\"sex hasn't been invented\\" in his house. In the episode \\"Michelle\\", his relationship with Sketch is discovered by Michelle and Maxxie, who confront Anwar about it due to Sketch's previous behaviour. In series 2's \\"Chris\\", while at Chris' house-warming party Maxxie confronts both Sketch and Anwar about Anwar's recent choice of style which disturbingly mirrors that of Maxxie. Anwar, oblivious to Sketch's designs reacts first in disbelief then informs Sketch that she is dumped. In the series two finale, Anwar is nervous after he receives his A-Level results in the post, as he has pledged not to open them until after Chris' funeral, even when his mother offers to steam them open. Anwar decides to open them anyway, and his reaction is one of shock, horror and dismay. Unable to go to his friends or his family, Anwar visits Sketch, his ex-girlfriend, and confides to her about them, and she reveals to him that he never gave any thought to his future. She then persuades him that his friends will eventually move on, and suggests they get back together. Anwar leaves before the results can be read out, and Maxxie reveals that the grades were, in fact, two E's and a U.

George Mason, a United States founding father, gave Hollin Hall to his third son, Thomson Mason, through deeds of gift in 1781 and 1786. The land, as given, totalled . Thomson Mason was the first member of the Mason family to actually live here. Before then, tenants farmed the property. George Mason also helped Thomson Mason have a house constructed. Thomson and his wife, Sarah McCarty Chichester, celebrated Christmas, 1788 in the new house. However, as late as 1792 George Mason wrote Thomson about difficulties procuring lumber for the Hollin Hall front porch. Fire destroyed the house in 1824, four years after Thomson's death. An outbuilding survived and became known as Little Hollin Hall. Purchased by Edward and Eliza Gibbs, it remained in use until the 20th century. In 1916, industrialist Harley Wilson and his wife bought the property and constructed a new residence, pool and other buildings. It was advertised for sale again in 1938. The Hollin Hills (whose name was inspired by the estate) neighborhood, primary to the west and north of Hollin Hall, was developed in the 1940s and is now a historic district. The Mount Vernon Unitarian Church bought the property from Mrs. Merle Thorpe in 1958. It hosted a Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) training workshop in 1961, as well as other civil rights activities, both local and national, during the next several years. The congregation also worked against the Vietnam War and for affordable housing. In 1983, the church sold part of the property to finance construction of a new meeting house to replace the old car garage. Fairfax County added the building to The Fairfax County Inventory of Historic Sites in 1993. In 1994, with the help of Alexandria's Campagna Center, the main hall was restored as a decorator showcase, and started hosting concerts several years later. Further renovations (e.g. kitchen and air-conditioning) were performed in 2003–2004. It is currently available for function rental such as weddings.

It is on the modern A308 road and links the boroughs of Spelthorne and Runnymede at Staines-upon-Thames and Egham Hythe. The bridge crosses the Thames on the reach between Penton Hook Lock and Bell Weir Lock, and is close to and upstream of the main mouth of the River Colne, a tributary. The bridge carries the Thames Path across the river. Its forebear built in Roman Britain, the bridge has been bypassed by three arterial routes, firstly in 1961 by the Runnymede Bridge near Wraysbury and in the 1970s by the building of the UK motorway network (specifically near Maidenhead and Chertsey). Owing to the commercial centres of the town in Spelthorne and of Egham, the bridge has had peak hour queues since at least the 1930s. History In Roman times, Staines lay on the Devil's Highway, an important road connecting the provincial capital Londinium (London) with points west via Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester). The site's Latin name was Pontes (\\"The Bridges\\"), implying that there was more than one bridge. It is believed that these bridges traversed Church Island. A wooden bridge was referenced as early as 1228, and required regular repair. It was put out of use during the Civil War. Under an act of 1791, a stone bridge was built a little way downstream of the old one, the latter being retained. The central arch of this bridge cracked almost immediately and a third bridge - but of iron - was completed in 1803. This failed and a fourth bridge, also of iron was opened in 1807. The old wooden bridge, which had continued in service, was then pulled down. The fifth and present bridge with three arches in white granite was designed by George Rennie. Construction started in 1827, and it was opened in 1832.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles From the 1940s until the 1970s this was a hotspot for summer holiday traffic jams due to many motorists heading from London towards the south-west. When the M3 and later the M25 bridges were constructed, the traffic was diverted away from the town.  In literature  In his Arthurian novel Enemy of God Bernard Cornwell sites an 11-arch stone bridge at Pontes/Staines. He attributes it 7 arches over the river with two on land at each end. A the Western end is a tower over the road from Calleva, which bears a plaque commemorating its building by Emperor Hadrian. At the Eastern end an earth-walled settlement. Bernard Cornwell, Enemy of God, Penguin 1997, p. 175 Roman Road The Roman Road does not have a popular name, but a straight line road route from Staines to London Wall can clearly be traced on modern maps via the A30, A315, A402 and Oxford Street. It passes through modern Hounslow, Brentford, Kensington and Holborn, interrupted only by a stretch of the District line between Gunnersbury and Turnham Green. An early Saxon route from The Strand out of the City via Charing Cross in northern Westminster supplemented this and became a rival road from the city to Staines Bridge. The route west of Staines is known as the Devil's Highway, and it runs in a straight course to the Roman settlement Calleva Atrebatum in the parish of Silchester. The Saxons abandoned Calleva, building their own village centre nearby. The next Roman road clockwise out of London is Watling Street to Wroxeter (Viroconium) near Shrewsbury, and the next Roman road anti- clockwise is the confusingly named Stane Street to Chichester (Noviomagus Regnorum).

She was a Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland between February 2000 and February 2020, representing the electorate of Bundamba. Miller entered parliament in a 2000 by-election upon the resignation of the former member for Bundamba, Bob Gibbs. Bundamba was considered a safe seat for the Labor Party, and Miller won all the elections in the seat from 2001 to 2017. Following Labor's defeat in the 2012 election, Miller was elevated to the frontbench. On 16 February 2015 she was sworn in as Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services and Minister for Corrective Services in the Palaszczuk Ministry. On 4 December 2015, Miller resigned from cabinet following a Queensland Parliamentary Ethics Committee Report stating that although she had not been guilty of contempt of Parliament, she had engaged in a \\"pattern of reckless conduct.\\" The committee's investigation focused on revelations Miller had signed a document stating she had correctly disposed of confidential Parliamentary Crime and Corruption Committee papers, which were later found by an Opposition MP in a safe used to store those papers. Her resignation came one day after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk signalled her intention to remove Miller from her portfolios. In October 2018, Miller voted against the government's successful proposal to decriminalise abortion in Queensland, making her the only Labor Party MP to do so. In January 2020, it was reported that Miller was considering resigning her seat in order to contest the City of Ipswich mayoral election, to be held on 28 March. Miller resigned as the Member for Bundamba on 20 February 2020, but announced she would not seek election to Ipswich City Council.

Unlike other OpenGL implementations, Chromium does not render the OpenGL command stream to a raster image in order to display on-screen. Instead, it manipulates, and moves the OpenGL command stream to other OpenGL implementations (including even other Chromium implementations). Chromium provides an infrastructure in which modules, known as SPUs or Stream Processing Units, can be inserted. For each OpenGL command, a SPU can modify, discard, or forward it to the next SPU. Chromium supports a client/server architecture. The last SPU in a node can choose to either pass it to another local OpenGL implementation, such as a graphics card, or send it over a network to one or more Chromium Servers. Uses include: * Providing OpenGL for multi-machine, multi-monitor displays. Chromium can be used to provide OpenGL for Xdmx displays. * Moving an OpenGL stream from one machine to another. For example, an OpenGL application running in a Windows virtual machine, without 3D acceleration, can make use of full hardware 3D acceleration on a Linux host machine via the use of Chromium. * Manipulating an OpenGL stream. Chromium can be used to make polygons an application renders transparent. * Via stream manipulation, Chromium can make non-stereoscopic applications stereoscopic. * High performance, sort-last configurations.

In the production of Korn only the cereal grain types rye, wheat, barley, oats and buckwheat are permissible. Most of the production is based on rye or wheat; barley is mainly used to obtain the required malt for the brewing process, while oats and buckwheat are rarely used.The addition of food colorings, flavorings, or sweeteners is not permitted. Korn differs from vodka in that it is distilled to lower alcoholic proofs and less rigorously filtered, which leaves more of the cereal grain flavor in the finished spirit. Korn must contain a minimum of 32% ABV (64 proof). Above 37.5% ABV (75 proof) it may be named Kornbrand, and the name Doppelkorn, with 38% ABV (76 proof), has been used in the market. Korn is usually consumed neat in shot glasses, but is also popular with a soft drink mixer. In some places, a beer is often ordered together with a ' (\\"short\\"), i.e., a shot glass of Korn. This combination is called in German a \\"Herrengedeck\\" (literally \\"gentlemen's place-setting\\"; English: \\"Boilermaker\\") in most parts of Germany. Fruit- flavored products made with Korn are available from some Korn manufacturers, though they are sold as liqueurs since Korn itself cannot be flavored. Very strong Korn (80% ABV / 160 proof) is known as \\"Ansatzkorn\\" and is typically used to produce home made liqueurs from fruits and herbs, such as Zirbenschnaps (liqueur flavoured with stone pine cones) - a practice that is particularly common in alpine regions. Such liqueurs are usually diluted to drinking strength before bottling. Like other neutral strong spirits, Ansatzkorn can also be used as a disinfectant for domestic use. History Korn is believed to have been produced in Germany since the 15th century. The first Korn production ban was imposed in 1545. A decree of the city council of Nordhausen prohibited the use of grain or malt for the production of spirits. Historians believe beer brewers wanted to defend themselves against the competition of Kornbrand producers, which had increased the cost of grain. The first \\"purity law\\" (German Reinheitsgebot) for the distillation of Korn was established in 1789. The regulation set by the city of Nordhausen stipulated that two thirds rye and one third barley or malt shall be used. Manufacture The process for distilling Korn is similar to other grain- based distilled spirits, such as whisky. Grain, normally wheat or rye, is ground usually in a hammermill and then cooked with hot water, forming a mash. The temperature is then reduced, and enzyme-rich ground barley malt or enzyme mixture is added to convert the grain starches into sugar. The mash is then cooled and fermented with yeast, producing ethanol in the mash. This is followed by the distillation process. The spirit is subjected to multiple distillations in order to remove unwanted odors and flavors. The resulting high-proof distillate (about 85% ABV, compared to about 95% for vodka) is diluted with water. To round off and harmonize the bouquet, high-quality Kornbrands are aged in oak, then diluted to the desired drinking strength and bottled. Korn production in Germany The industrial production of Korn is concentrated in several regions of Germany: Bad Oldesloe in Schleswig- Holstein, Nordhausen in northern Thuringia, Haselünne in the Lower Saxony district of Emsland and Oelde in Westphalia. In Nordhausen, the company Echter Nordhäuser Spirituosen GmbH produces the Korn brand \\"Echter Nordhäuser\\" (Original Nordhäuser). In 1799, Otto von Bismarck's father, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, established a Korn distillery at Schönhausen. Korn market leaders in Germany are the brands Oldesloer Weizenkorn, followed by Strothmann Weizenkorn and Echter Nordhäuser Korn (2004). For Doppelkorn, Echter Nordhäuser Doppelkorn was the market leader in 2007, followed by Berentzen Doornkaat and Fürst Bismarck Kornbrandhttp://www.fuerstbismarck- kornbrand.de/index.php.

It currently serves the B67 bus of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The B67 is dispatched out of the Jackie Gleason Depot in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.  Route description and service  The B67 route starts at McDonald Avenue and Cortelyou Road in Kensington, near the Ditmas Avenue station () on the New York City Subway's IND Culver Line. This terminus is shared with the B69. The two routes then continue up McDonald Avenue passing the Church Avenue station (), and connecting with the B35. North of Albemarle Road, the Culver Line turns away from McDonald Avenue and runs to 20th Street, where it runs northwest on 20th Street to 7th Avenue. Here, buses run up the corridor, serving a commercial street in Park Slope. At Ninth Street there is a transfer to the Culver Line's Seventh Avenue station (). Both routes continue up Seventh Avenue until Seventh Avenue meets Flatbush Avenue, at the Seventh Avenue station on the BMT Brighton Line. At this location, the B69 turns south towards Grand Army Plaza, while the B67 continues up Flatbush Avenue with the B41. The line then heads into Downtown Brooklyn, interchanging with the B45 at the Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center station () by the Atlantic Terminal mall and adjacent LIRR station. All routes then head past the Barclays Center, making no stops, until it reaches Livingston Street where buses turn onto Livingston to head into Downtown Brooklyn. The B67 diverges from the B41 and B45 at Jay Street and serves the Jay Street–MetroTech station (). This stop is shared by the B57 and B62 buses, which split off from Jay Street at Tillary Street. The B67 then continues along Jay Street, paralleling the IND Sixth Avenue Line () to the York Street station, where it enters Dumbo. Once in Dumbo, B67 buses meander through several streets until it turns south onto Gold Street and then east onto Sands Street. The line then continues via Sands Street until it reaches the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where buses enter through its Sands Street gate. Once in the yard, buses also travel via several streets, making two stops until it exits the yard at Clymer Street and Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, where it runs north to its terminus at Division Street and Wythe Avenue. On weekdays, buses travel the full route from Kensington to Williamsburg, via the Brooklyn Navy Yard to serve Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. On weekends, the northern terminal of the line is at Jay Street and Sands Street, and does not continue into Williamsburg. There is no overnight service. History Seventh Avenue horse cars were replaced with electric trolleys on July 17, 1893. The route was a streetcar line until February 11, 1951, when the line was replaced with a bus route, designated \\"B-67\\". In June 2010, late night service was discontinued, and the B69 bus was rerouted along Seventh Avenue south of the Brighton Line, all in part of the budget cuts. Service was also reduced on both routes so the service on Seventh Avenue was similar to before. On September 9, 2013, the route was extended into South Williamsburg via the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Vinegar Hill to serve new economic activity. Along with Downtown Brooklyn, both Dumbo and the Brooklyn Navy Yard are part of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle, a cluster of economic activity occurring in Brooklyn.http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/servChanges_B67.htm B67 Route extended to Brooklyn Navy Yard, mta.info References Category:Streetcar lines in Brooklyn B067 B067 ","title":"B67 (New York City bus)"},{"id":"9799772","text":"PIFF may refer to: * Busan International Film Festival, previously Pusan International Film Festival * Pune International Film Festival References ","title":"PIFF"},{"id":"9799776","text":"Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) is a Filipino radio and TV network established in 1963. As of December 2013, NBC is a subsidiary of MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. under the PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund. NBC operates television and radio stations with airtime being leased by affiliate TV5 and its corporate offices and studios are located at the TV5 Media Center, Reliance cor. Sheridan Sts., Mandaluyong City. History =Radio= NBC was established by Abelardo Yabut, Sr. in 1963, coinciding with the launch of the network's pioneer AM station in Zamboanga City. Using a surplus transmitter that he bought from Deeco Electronics in Manila, the station ironically had the last three letters of the alphabet as the call letters; thus DXYZ was born ― but it was a foreboding of bigger things to come. With already the string of 10 AM stations in provincial areas at that time; in 1973, Yabut put up DWFM 92.3 in Manila ― his first entry to the nation's capital, and the third FM station to establish in the same area. Two years later in 1975, under his tutelage, NBC brought the first FM station in Cebu City DYNC 101.9 (which also became the first stereo FM station in that city); and also in the same year, when the network pioneered FM broadcasting in Davao City with the inauguration of DXFM 101.9. In 1987, NBC acquired DWXX 1026 AM from Hypersonic Broadcasting Center and it was reformatted as DZAM Radyo 1026: Ating Maasahan, which featured news, commentaries, and well-balanced mix of entertainment and music programming. In 1998, DZAM changed its call letters to DZAR, and reformatted into a news and talk based station. NBC also pioneered in many ways as the first network to broadcast 24 hours a day outside of Metro Manila. It was the first network to bridge the archipelago with the utilization of satellite broadcasting, and continues to cover the live games of the Philippine Amateur Basketball League and the Philippine Basketball Association (the latter broadcasts this time via the Radyo5 News FM Network). In 1996, NBC has grown to become a nationwide network of AM & FM stations: 16 AM stations and 15 FM stations in 20 cities. On April 8, 1998, NBC was granted a 25-year legislative franchise by Congress under Republic Act No. 8623 without President signature. In the same year, NBC became the only FM radio network in the Philippines consisting of member-stations named after their respective markets. DZAR was the first to launch in 1998 through its nationwide transmission. At that time, DZAR 1026 and other NBC AM stations were rebranded as **Angel Radyo**. In 2005, The Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) leader Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy and the Swara Sug Media Corporation acquired all NBC AM stations and rebranded it as Sonshine Radio. In 1973, DWFM was established as the first FM station during the martial law era. MRS 92.3 was an adult contemporary station, which played listeners' most requested songs. Its provincial stations carried the format as well. When PLDT media subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. bought NBC from the consortium led by the Yabut family and real estate magnate Manny Villar in 1998, its stations rebranded into their respective names under the @ Rhythms banner. DWFM in Manila became Joey and aired a smooth jazz and R&B; format. Tony in Zamboanga aired oldies, ranging from the 50s and 60s. Rocky in Iligan aired modern rock. The remaining NBC stations in Baguio (Jesse), Cabanatuan (Donna), San Pablo, Laguna (Lovely), Naga (Nikki), Legazpi (Alex), Bacolod (Jamie), Cebu (Charlie), Davao (Danni), Butuan (Jake), Cagayan de Oro (Sandy), General Santos (Anna) and Cotabato (Marco) aired a contemporary hit radio format. The Rhythms banner was dropped in 2004, leaving their names intact. On 8 April 2007, XFM began after 923 Joey was signed off on 4 April, just before Holy week. XFM featured ambient, chill, down-tempo, electronica, house, lounge, trip-hop and indie music on radio until its ground-breaking format in February 2008. In October 2009, the Manila, Cebu and Davao stations discontinued their Smooth AC format. The Manila station became U92, in partnership with All Youth Channels. It became the first CHR-formatted station focused on MTV Philippines broadcasting from a state-of-the-art studio at Silver City Mall, Frontera Verde Complex, Pasig City. The Cebu and Davao stations became WAV FM, in partnership with AudioWAV (WAV Atmospheric), a Makati City-based multinational instore radio company known for producing customized music and messaging for large chains across Southeast Asia and North America. The other provincial stations retained their formats. On September 30, 2010, U92 shut down following the dissolution of MTV Philippines in February. On October 1, 2010, NBC, in partnership with its affiliate ABC Development Corporation (TV5), took over the management of 92.3 FM. As part of TV5's expansion, the station will become Radyo5 92.3 News FM, the first news/talk station on FM band. On November 8, it had its debut at 12:30 am and its first day of broadcasting began at 4 am. Beginning February 21, 2011, Radyo5 is scheduled to broadcast nationwide through its provincial relay stations on AM and FM. However, due to budget cuts from TV5, only 6 provincial stations remains operational and others like Radyo5 94.3 News FM San Pablo are closed down. =Television= Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC-41) is a commercial UHF television station owned by First Pacific conglomerate and headed by Manuel Pangilinan, who is also the chairman of the telecommunications giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT). The name was unfamiliar to many Filipinos. NBC TV 41 used to be MTV Philippines. MTV (\\"Music Television\\") is a cable TV network which was originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. MTV later became an outlet for a variety of material aimed at adolescents and young adults. After six years of partnership in the Philippines, MTV Channel 41 has gone off the air after a multi-year deal with All Youth Channel (AYC). This follows the dissolution of the partnership with NBC. MTV Philippines became a defunct channel in February 2010. It was inactive until October 2010 when it began test broadcasting as TV5 and when ABC Development Corporation took over the management of NBC stations. It then took over the blocktime of UHF Channel 41, which alternates programming ABC Development Corporation. It was simulcast with Radyo5 92.3 News FM for a few months when it debuted on November 8.TV5 allocates P10b to battle ABS-CBN, GMA-7. Manila Standard Today. Retrieved 10-4-10.

AksyonTV was launched at exactly 4 am, airing its first program, Andar ng Mga Balita, hosted by Martin Andanar (now with Presidential Communications Operations Office), which was a simulcast of the morning news program on Radyo5 News FM of the same title. After 8 years as news channel (sports content was later added), AksyonTV is announced to be rebranded as 5 Plus on January 13, 2019, with its programs consisting of mostly sports from ESPN5 and serving as a complementary channel for The 5 Network. On March 8, 2020 (after 14 months as 5 Plus), the channel was relaunched when One Sports took over its channel space, making it available on free TV and other pay television operators.

The company claim to be the oldest clock manufacturer in the world, originally established in 1690, and have been part of the Smith of Derby Group since 1965. The claim is challenged by another English firm of clockmakers, Thwaites & Reed, who claim to have been in continuous manufacture since before 1740, with antecedents to 1610. History William Joyce began in the North Shropshire village of Cockshutt making longcase clocks. The family business was handed down from father to son and in 1790 moved to High Street, Whitchurch, Shropshire. In 1904 J. B. Joyce moved to Station Road, Whitchurch. In 1834 Thomas Joyce made large clocks for local churches and public buildings. In 1849 the company copied the Big Ben escapement designed by Lord Grimthorpe. The firm made large clocks for many public buildings, both at home and overseas, and for some of the principal railway companies. Since 1945 the company installed over 2,000 large public clocks in Britain and Ireland, the majority being the synchronous mains-controlled type and a high proportion installed in churches. In 1964, Norman Joyce, the last member of the Joyce family, retired and sold the company to Smith of Derby.http://www.whitchurchherald.co.uk/news/109347/j-b- joyce-facing-restructuring-process.aspx During the 1970s, many clocks were changed to electric motors made by the new Smith parent company, thereby losing a heritage of mechanical clocks. The J. B. Joyce brand name has been upheld by Smith, who now maintain many original J. B. Joyce heritage pieces still in operation in public places around the world. On 28 November 2012 a timed-bid auction was held to dispose of the surplus items accumulated at the Station Road premises and lovers of the work of J. B. Joyce joined with interior designers and collectors of historic items in bidding to own a piece of horological history.

These lines entered the bridge roadway from Fulton Street or Sands Street in Downtown Brooklyn, some of them using elevated trackage at the Sands Street elevated railway station. History Initially, all lines reached the bridge by way of the Brooklyn Heights Railroad's Graham Avenue Line tracks in Sands Street. Cars could enter Sands Street to the west at Fulton Street (many Brooklyn Heights lines) or to the east at Washington Street (Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad's DeKalb Avenue Line) or Adams Street (Nassau Electric Railroad's Adams Street and Boerum Place Line). From Washington Street, tracks ran east on High Street to the CI&B;'s Smith Street Line, Concord Street on the Nassau Electric's Park Avenue Line and Vanderbilt Avenue Line, and Myrtle Avenue on the Brooklyn Heights's Myrtle Avenue Line. The first line across the bridge was the Graham Avenue Line, a minor line approaching downtown from the east on Sands Street. This line was chosen because of its half-hour headway, and its cars began crossing the bridge on January 23, 1898. The Brooklyn-bound elevated track can be seen to the left of the elevated railway tracks in this 1936 photo. A new elevated trolley line on the Brooklyn end of the bridge opened on September 28, 1908, taking trolleys bound for Fulton Street through the Sands Street station of the elevated railways and underneath the connection to the Fulton Street Elevated. This eliminated congestion caused by the crossing of the bridge-bound cars from Fulton Street and the Brooklyn- bound cars to eastbound Sands Street. The Court Street Line, Flatbush Avenue Line, Fulton Street Line, Gates Avenue Line, Myrtle Avenue Line, Putnam Avenue Line, and Union Street Line were moved to this route.Brian J.

He was also a coach in the United States Football League (USFL). He played for the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs over the course of his seven-year NFL career. Gaines was the running backs and special teams coach for the New Jersey Generals of the USFL. Early years Gaines was one of only 13 African American students to volunteer to integrate Elbert County High School in Elberton, Georgia. He was coached by Boyd Outz. After graduating from Elbert County Comprehensive High School, Gaines attended Lees-McRae College and graduated from Wake Forest University. In his two seasons as a Demon Deacon, Gaines gained 1,258 yards on 336 carries (3.7 avg.), and was team captain and an All-ACC selection his senior year. Professional career Gaines made his professional debut in the NFL in 1976 with the New York Jets. In his rookie season, Gaines ran for 724 yards and hauled in 41 receptions for the Jets. Having been overlooked in the draft due to injuries, Gaines signed with the Jets as a free agent and became the first rookie ever selected as Jets' MVP. In the 1976 season, he led all NFL rookies with 724 yards rushing despite not starting until the seventh game, set a franchise record with four 100-yard rushing games in a single season, and was selected AFC Offensive Rookie of the Year by NFL Players Association. After being sidelined due to injuries in 1978, Gaines returned in 1979 as a dominant force for the Jets once again. In the 1979 season, he became the first Jet ever to lead the team in rushing and receiving twice, finishing the season fourth among AFC rushing leaders, tied for first in the AFC in yards per carry, and fumbled only once in 186 carries. The Sporting News named him the best running back in the AFC East and the most individual offensive improvement in the division in 1979. On September 21, 1980, Gaines broke a Jets franchise record with 17 catches in a single game against the San Francisco 49ers, a franchise record that still stands. Gaines is currently third, and first among running backs, in the NFL record books for receptions per game. He was the first undrafted running back to reach 500 yards rushing as a rookie, and one of six in NFL history to do so. He \\"wore many hats\\" for the Jets: although technically a running back, he was also a prolific receiver, was an intimidating blocker in short yardage situations, and played special teams. Gaines broke his leg in a game against the New England Patriots, in week 5 of the 1980 NFL season. The following year, the Jets attempted to activate him off IR, by clearing waivers. Instead, the Kansas City Chiefs claimed him. He finished his playing career in Kansas City. NFLPA Gaines has been employed with the NFL Players Association for 22 years, and in April 2008 was promoted to Assistant Executive Director. Personal life Gaines's jersey is retired at Elbert County Comprehensive High School. In 2009, he received the Elbert County Native Citizen Award by the Elbert County Chamber of Commerce.

He lives in Milan, where he has amassed a large collection of Dada and Surrealist art, including many works by personal friends such as Marcel Duchamp, André Breton, Man Ray, and Jean Arp. Schwarz was born in Alexandria, Egypt from a German father and an Italian mother. In 1952 he relocated to Milan, where he opened an independent art publishing house. In 1961 Schwartz converted his place into a gallery, organising exhibitions of Dada and Surrealism artists. The gallery officially closed in 1975, and Schwarz started working as curator and writer, writing extensive publications on the work of Marcel Duchamp, as well as books and numerous essays on the Kabbalah, Tantrism, alchemy, prehistoric and tribal art, and Asian art and philosophy. His 1977 book on Man Ray's works and life was the first to reveal Ray's real name (Emmanuel Radnitzky). In late 1990s he donated his 700-piece collection of Dada and Surrealist art to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. On 6 March 1998 he was awarded the Diploma of First Class with gold medal for outstanding merits in the fields of culture and the arts by the President of Italian Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, on the recommendation of the Minister of Cultural Heritage Walter Veltroni. In 2006 he won Italy's Premio Frascati for his collected works of poetry (1946-2007).

Dachary currently contributes to free software projects and acts as president of the Free Software Foundation in France. He is a speaker for the GNU Project and the April association. Right now he is a full-time volunteer for the SecureDrop project. Career Dachary started as a C and Lisp developer in 1986. In 1987, he was hired to teach Unix and programming at Axis. In 1988, Lectra launched a 68k based hardware, and Dachary led a Unix System V port using the GNU Compiler Collection. When the project was completed, he took a sabbatical in 1989 to create the GNA, a non- profit group for the development and distribution of free software. Dachary went back to development for Tic Tac Toon and Agence France-Presse (AFP), where he learned C++. In 1995, he founded the Ecila search engine, which was acquired by Tiscali and discontinued in 2001. After two years dedicated to the FSF France, Dachary worked for INRIA on RFID software in 2003. Starting with Mekensleep in 2004, Dachary wrote poker related free software, which was published as part of the PokerSource project. In 2007 he was hired by OutFlop, a startup specialized in poker software services based on PokerSource. In 2011 he became a Free Software freelancer and worked on XiVO. In January 2012, Loïc became involved in OpenStack and worked as a Ceph developer. From 2017 he is working on SecureDrop project as a full-time volunteer. Non-profit career =GNA= When he was employed by Axis in 1987, Dachary offered copies of free software on magnetic tapes, such as Emacs or the GNU Compiler Collection. The Internet was difficult to access at the time and he became a distributor of software. After working on the Lectra project, Dachary created the GNA (Gna's Not Axis) non profit organization in 1989. Although the original goal of GNA was to develop free software, it started as a news and mail provider. The connectivity to the a news and mail provider in Washington, D.C. was provided by Agence France-Presse (AFP) over a half-used satellite link. In 1990, GNA provided mail and news feeds to over 200 non profit organisations, individuals, and companies. GNA kept distributing free software on magnetic tapes. Compiling from the sources was difficult and Dachary packaged pre- compiled binaries for the Motorola 68000 family, x86 and SPARC. He left tapes at his computer book store, Le Monde en \\"tique\\" who sold them to his customers. Richard Stallman occasionally visited France and met Dachary when he started to spread free software. During his year at GNA, Dachary took advantage of Stallman's presence in France to organize conferences at École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers, Paris 8 University and his former school École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées. =Nineties= In 1990, Dachary took a secondary role in GNA as his friend Hugues Lafarge became president. In 1996, he met with the founders of April, a French Free Sotftware NGO, to whom he donated their first server, hosted at Ecila's office. =Savannah= Dachary returned to a more active role in non profit work in 2000, when he wrote the code for the newly created SourceForge platform. In an attempt to understand the project dynamics, he travelled to VA Linux offices and met with Eric Raymond and Tim Perdue, but felt the team was too focused on in-house interactions to welcome an external contributor. However, he became familiar with the published code base and when VA Linux started to use proprietary software, he created an alternative platform using the latest free software code base published: GNU Savannah. In early 2001, Dachary secured the funds to buy hardware for the Free Software Foundation offices and moved to Boston to install them. In late 2001, when VA Linux asked him to assign copyright for his contributions, Dachary published an article explaining why it was time to move away from SourceForge. In 2002, Dachary gradually delegated his responsibilities to GNU Savannah contributors and Free Software Foundation staff and retired in 2003. =Copyleft compliance= In 2001, the Free Software Foundation established a presence in Europe and Dachary took part in the process by creating FSF France (renaming GNA publication number 20010027 in Journal Officiel) and serving as the first vice president of FSF Europe. In addition to supporting the growth of GNU Savannah, FSF France assisted French developers and companies with GPL compliance. With Bradley M. Kuhn, executive director of the Free Software Foundation at the time, Dachary worked the first contract of the new GPL Compliance Labs for a French governmental agency. His ongoing interest in enforcing Copyleft licenses led to a few visible outcomes such as the publication of C&CS; by Orange and SFR, and the court case involving Free, but most of it is kept confidential. In 2009, Dachary joined the Software Freedom Conservancy board of directors for a few years. =EUCD.INFO= In late 2002, Dachary became concerned by the lack of protest against the European Copyright Directive that was about to be transposed into French law. Instead of acting in the name of FSF France and because the problems were not limited to free software, he launched the EUCD.INFO initiative. After six months of full-time lobbying, he hired Christophe Espern to work for FSF France and delegated his responsibilities. Dachary has not played an active role since, although he keeps in touch through his friend Jérémie Zimmermann, Christophe Espern's successor, co- founder and spokesperson of La Quadrature du Net. =GNA! and hosting= In late 2003, the GNU Savannah compromise created tensions in the governance. In early 2004, Dachary worked with Mathieu Roy to set up GNA! using the same policy and software, but with a different decisional process. In 2010, the maintainers of Savannah and GNA! overlapped and worked as a network administrator for both. Although centralized forges such as GNA! are popular, Dachary has recently gradually transgressed towards distributed hosting. He collects machines and hosting facilities under the umbrella of FSF France and runs OpenStack based clusters on them. Dachary helps projects such as the GNU Compiler Collection and Software Freedom Conservancy by providing and maintaining machines on this infrastructure. In late 2008, he created an amateur datacenter (codename microdtc34) in a seven square meter room in the center of Paris with Laurent Guerby who was in the process of creating the tetaneutral.net, a non profit ISP. =April.org= Dachary was appointed an honorary member of the April association. On the behalf of April he participated in the commission spécialisée de terminologie et de néologie de l'informatique et des composants électroniques from 2006 to 2009, primarily to discuss the definition of \\"free software\\". =Upstream University= Shortly after the April 2012 OpenStack summit, Dachary founded Upstream University to train developers to become better Free Software contributors.

Retirement He returned to Memphis in 2005, partly to finish his degree under the invitation of coach John Calipari and the athletic department. Another motivation for the move was to bring his son Bobby Jr. (also known as \\"Ray Ray\\"), a promising teenage player, to Memphis to expose him to better basketball competition. Parks also served as the personal assistant to John Paul \\"Jack\\" Jones, a wealthy University of Virginia alumnus from Memphis who is the namesake for UVA's current basketball arena.

Cable broadcasts began February 16, 1963 for some 6,000 inner city households, into which special receivers were installed. The service was provided free of charge. Radio San Nicolas became the first radio station in Argentina to transmit by cable. It soon emerged as a valuable consulting resource for parties interested in establishing similar cable stations in other cities. In September 1993, LT24 AM 1430 and FM88 were the first stations in the region to utilize digital audio for on-air advertising. On December 31, 1998, LT24 launched live, around the clock broadcasts over the Internet using the RealAudio format. Today, the station broadcasts live in MP3 using an Icecast server.

The station consists of two halls, both serving the Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line and Moskovsko-Petrogradskaya Line trains. The first hall serves the southbound trains, while the second hall serves the northbound ones. History Entrance hall The first hall was opened on November 15, 1955, as part of the first metro line between Avtovo and Ploshchad Vosstaniya. The name comes from the fact that the surface vestibule is located immediately next to Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology. The architects were A. M. Sokolov and A. K. Andreyev (surface vestibule and underground hall). The basic theme of the station is the achievements of Russian and Soviet science. The basic material for decorating the underground hall is Ural marble. On the columns are 24 bas reliefs with portraits of well-known Soviet scientists. On the platform walls are placed decorative grilles. This deep column station existed for several years as an ordinary station of the Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line, with trains traveling in both directions. But on April 29, 1961, the second hall was opened, as a part of the second line of the Saint Petersburg Metro. This became the first cross-platform facility in the USSR, coming into full operation on November 1, 1963. The second hall, in contrast to the first, was built in the functional style, called for by Nikita Khrushchev's program of total economy. The architects A. I. Pribulskiy, A. Ya. Macheret, and V. V. Gankevich designed an almost white wall with decorative texts on the marble columns, chronicling the accomplishments of Soviet science and technology, which were continually added to over time. Initially, the second hall had no exit to the surface and was connected to the first by a central passage, during the construction of which the bas reliefs of Friedrich Engels and Joseph Stalin were removed. Only in 1980 did the architects A. S. Getskin, A. V. Kvyatovsky, and I. E. Sergeyev build a second inclined passage and join the vestibule of the first hall with the second. Exits from both halls are located at the northern end, with three escalators each. On April 3, 2017, a suicide bomber exploded on a train in Moskovsko-Petrogradskaya line between Sennaya Ploshchad and Tekhnologichesky Institut stations, killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens.http://woodtv.com/2017/04/04/death-toll-rises-to-14-in- russian-subway-bombing-suspect-idd/ References Category:Saint Petersburg Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1955 Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ","title":"Tekhnologichesky Institut (Saint Petersburg Metro)"},{"id":"9800074","text":"right Maurin Quina is a French apéritif advertisement painted by Leonetto Cappiello in 1906.

The rivalry is named for the Brazos River that flows by the two schools, which are 90 miles apart. The Battle of the Brazos debuted in 1899. The rivalry became dormant in 2012, when Texas A&M; left the Big 12 Conference to join the Southeastern Conference. History In the early days of the rivalry (1905 and earlier), Baylor and Texas A&M; played each other multiple times in a single year, possibly due to a dearth of regional opponents. The two teams were also geographically close with only a one-hour train ride separating the two colleges. =The Brawl= The 1926 football game coincided with Baylor's homecoming. During halftime Baylor Homecoming floats paraded around the field. When a float – actually a car pulling a flatbed trailer with several female Baylor students – neared the section where the Texas A&M; Corps of Cadets sat, a cadet raced towards the car and grabbed the steering wheel. The motion caused Louise Normand to fall off the truck, injuring her and inciting a large riot. Students began using metal folding chairs and planks of wood that had been used as yard markers for weapons. Texas A&M; student Lt. Charles Sessums was hit in the head during the melee and, although he initially appeared to recover, he died following the game. On December 8, 1926, the two school presidents agreed to temporarily suspend athletic relations between the schools. The schools would not compete against each other in any athletic event for the next four years. Baylor and Texas A&M; would not meet in football again until 1931. =Pranks= In 1936 Baylor students awoke to find Texas A&M; signs plastered across campus, with red paint applied to turn the Baylor flagpole into a barber pole. A huge sign on Waco Hall predicted, \\"A and M 50, Baylor 0.\\" It was once great sport before a big football matchup for Aggie students to drive to Waco with nefarious intentions of capturing Baylor's bear mascot. Baylor students sometimes resorted to extraordinary defensive measures. In 1946 they placed mascot Chita in the custody of Waco Police so the Aggies could not find her. In the 1950s, two Aggie students drove to Waco and stole the Baylor mascot, a young bear cub, from the Baylor campus. While they were driving back to College Station in a brand–new car belonging to one of their families, the bear panicked. Twenty–miles from Waco, the bear ripped out the inside of the car, and the boys set it free. The young men were caught when they took the car to be repaired. The young cub did not survive its injuries. In 1954, Baylor mascot Nip and her trailer disappeared. Yet, the next day both the bear and trailer were found under a bridge on the highway to College Station. Baylor students likewise pranked the Aggies, often sneaking onto the Texas A&M; campus to spray green paint on the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. Ross was the third president of Texas A&M;, who graduated from Baylor's two year college preparatory program. Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, was expelled from Baylor after he was in part found painting one of A&M;'s buildings green. Football The competitive peak of the series between Baylor and Texas A&M; most likely occurred between 1960 and 1990 during which time Baylor won 13 games, A&M; won 16 games, and two games ended in ties. During that same time period 18 of the 31 games played saw the final margin of victory to be 7 points or less. Texas Football magazine voted the 1986 game between the schools the Game of the Decade of the 80s in the Southwest Conference. Baylor led the game 17–0 in the 1st half and was positioned to score again when the Texas A&M; defense was able to stop the Bears with a goal line stand. The Aggies came back in the final minutes with an 80-yard drive resulting in a touchdown and a 31–30 victory. The victory allowed them to claim the SWC Championship and advance to the Cotton Bowl for a second straight year. while Baylor finished in 2nd and ended the year with a victory over Colorado in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Another exciting game was the 1978 contest in which little- known Baylor freshman Walter Abercrombie rushed for 207 yards in a 24–6 Baylor win in College Station. The 207 yards were a then NCAA record for rushing yardage in an initial game. In the 1980 contest Baylor won by the score of 46–7, going on that year to win the SWC Championship by a record 3 games and garnering a berth in the Cotton Bowl, where they were beaten by Alabama. The thrilling 1986 A&M; win began a period of domination in the series, in which Baylor did not beat A&M; for 18 seasons (17 losses and a tie in 1990). The most lopsided match in the history of the rivalry occurred in 2003 when the Aggies routed the Bears by a score of 73–10. However, in 2004 an underdog Baylor Bear team defeated the No. 16 ranked Aggies 35–34 in overtime at Floyd Casey Stadium when the Bears converted a dramatic 2-point conversion on the final play of the game to earn their first win over the Aggies since 1985. The rivalry again became bitter in 2005 when the Aggies completed two fourth down conversions to win at home 16–13 in overtime. The Baylor Bears defeated the Aggies for the second time in 5 years in 2008. Baylor has won 2 of the last 4 series games in Waco (2004 & 2008). In 2011 Texas A&M; won the probable final meeting for the foreseeable future. With A&M;'s decision to leave the Big 12 Conference following the 2011 season, resumption of the series is not likely at this point unless the two schools meet in a post season bowl game. =Game results= Basketball In men's basketball, Baylor and A&M; have competed since the 1914–15 debut season of the Southwest Conference. With 218 games played, A&M; leads the series with 139 wins, 75 losses and 4 ties. Since the formation of the Big 12 the teams have followed somewhat parallel paths. Both spent the early years of the conference as lower-division teams (they combined for one NIT appearance and zero NCAA appearances from 1996 to 2004, and both suffered winless conference seasons during that span). However, in more recent years, they have grown into Big 12 contenders, with A&M; reaching the NCAA's six straight years between 2006 and 2011 and Baylor making NCAA tourney appearances in 2008 before advancing all the way to the Elite 8 in 2010 and 2012. In 2011, Baylor did not reach postseason play but swept the series with the NCAA Tourney-Bound Aggies. After Texas A&M; moved to the SEC in 2012, the Battle of the Brazos was put on hold. The two schools scheduled out of conference games in 2014 and 2015, with each team winning on their home floor. In their most recent meeting, the #24 ranked Aggies beat the #16 Bears by a score of 80-61.

Britain was rich in resources such as copper, gold, iron, lead, salt, silver, and tin, materials in high demand in the Roman Empire. The Romans started panning and puddling for gold. The abundance of mineral resources in the British Isles was probably one of the reasons for the Roman conquest of Britain. They were able to use advanced technology to find, develop and extract valuable minerals on a scale unequaled until the Middle ages. Lead mining Roman lead mines at Charterhouse, Somerset Lead ingots from Roman Britain on display at the Wells and Mendip Museum Lead was essential to the smooth running of the Roman Empire.The Romans in Britain: mining It was used for piping for aqueducts and plumbing, pewter, coffins, and gutters for villas, as well as a source of the silver that sometimes occurred in the same mineral deposits. Fifty-two sheets of Mendip lead still line the great bath at Bath which is a few miles from Charterhouse (see below). The largest Roman lead mines were located in or near the Rio Tinto (river) in southern Hispania.http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt;=2099549 Lead from Carthaginian and Roman Spanish mines isotopically identified in Greenland ice dated from 600 B.C. to 300 A.D. ROSMAN K. J. R.; CHISHOLM W.; HONG S.; CANDELONE J.-P.; BOUTRON C. F.World Ecological Degradation, page 88. Sing C. Chew. Rowman Altamira, 2001. , https://books.google.com/books?id=GM5WOHR55wYC In Britannia the largest sources were at Mendip, South West England and especially at Charterhouse. In A.D. 49, six years after the invasion and conquest of Britain, the Romans had the lead mines of Mendip and those of Derbyshire, Shropshire, Yorkshire and Wales running at full shift. By A.D.70, Britain had surpassed Hispania as the leading lead-producing province. The Spanish soon lodged a complaint with the Emperor Vespasian, who in turn put limits on the amount of lead being produced in Britain. However British lead production continued to increase and ingots (or pigs) of lead have been found datable to the late second - early third century.Roman Britain: Industrial layer map Research has found that British lead (i.e. Somerset lead) was used in Pompeii - the town destroyed in the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D.79. Silver extraction The most important use of lead was the extraction of silver. Lead and silver were often found together in the form of galena, an abundant lead ore. The Roman economy was based on silver, as the majority of higher value coins were minted from the precious metal. The process of extraction, cupellation, was fairly simple. First, the ore was smelted until the lead, which contained the silver, separated from the rock. The lead was removed, and further heated up to 1100° Celsius using hand bellows. At this point, the silver was separated from the lead (the lead, in the form of litharge, was either blown off the molten surface or absorbed into bone ash crucibles; the litharge was re-smelted to recover the lead), and was put into moulds which, when cooled, would form ingots that were to be sent all over the Roman Empire for minting. When inflation took hold in the third century A.D. and official coins began to be minted made of bronze with a silver wash, two counterfeit mints appeared in Somerset - one on the Polden Hills just south of the Mendips, and the other at Whitchurch, Bristol to the north. These mints, using Mendip silver, produced coins which were superior in silver content to those issued by the official Empire mints. Samples of these coins and of their moulds can be seen in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton Castle. Gold mining Development of Dolaucothi Gold Mines The aqueducts at Dolaucothi Britain's gold mines were located in Wales at Dolaucothi. The Romans discovered the Dolaucothi vein soon after their invasion, and they used hydraulic mining methods to prospect the hillsides before discovering rich veins of gold-bearing quartzite. The remains of several aqueducts and water tanks above the mine are still visible today. The tanks were used to hold water for hushing during prospecting for veins, and involved releasing a wave of water to scour the ground and remove overburden, and expose the bedrock. If a vein was found, then it would be attacked using fire-setting, a method which involved building a fire against the rock. When the hot rock was quenched with water, it could be broken up easily, and the barren debris swept away using another wave of water. The technique produced numerous opencasts which are still visible in the hills above Pumsaint or Luentinum today. A fort, settlement and bath-house were set up nearby in the Cothi Valley. The methods were probably used elsewhere for lead and tin mining, and indeed, were used widely before explosives made them redundant. Hydraulic mining is however, still used for the extraction of alluvial tin. Long drainage adits were dug into one of the hills at Dolaucothi, after opencast mining methods were no longer effective. Once the ore was removed, it would be crushed by heavy hammers, probably automated by a water wheel until reduced to a fine dust. Then, the dust would be washed in a stream of water where the rocks and other debris would be removed, the gold dust and flakes collected, and smelted into ingots. The ingots would be sent all across the Roman world, where they would be minted or put into vaults. Iron mining There were many iron mines in Roman Britain. The index to the Ordnance Survey Map of Roman Britain lists 33 iron mines: 67% of these are in the Weald and 15% in the Forest of Dean. Because iron ores were widespread and iron was relatively cheap, the location of iron mines was often determined by the availability of wood, which Britain had in abundance, to make charcoal smelting fuel. Great amounts of iron were needed for the Roman war machine, and Britain was the perfect place to fill that need.Croydon Caving Club Many underground mines were constructed by the Romans. Once the raw ore was removed from the mine, it would be crushed, then washed. The less dense rock would wash away, leaving behind the iron oxide, which would then be smelted using the bloomery method. The iron was heated up to 1500 °C using charcoal. The remaining slag was removed and generally dumped. After being smelted, the iron was sent to forges, where it was reheated, and formed into weapons or other useful items. Coal For both domestic and industrial use, coal provided a considerable proportion of the fuel required for warmth, metal-working (coal was not suitable for the smelting of iron, but was more efficient than charcoal at the forging stage) and the production of bricks, tiles and pottery. This is demonstrated by archaeological evidence from sites as far apart as Bath, Somerset (the temple of Sulis and household hypocausts), military encampments along Hadrian's wall (where outcrop coal was worked near the outlying fortlet at Moresby), forts of the Antonine Wall, Carmel lead mines in north Wales and tile kilns at Holt, Clwyd. Excavations at the inland port of Heronbridge on the River Dee show that there was an established distribution network in place. Coal from the East Midlands coalfields was carried along the Car Dyke for use in forges to the north of Duroliponte (Cambridge) and for drying grain from this rich cereal-growing region. Extraction was not limited to open-cast exploitation of outcrops near the surface: shafts were dug and coal was hewn from horizontal galleries following the coal seams. Working conditions Fire-setting underground from De Re Metallica Rio Tinto mines Some miners may have been slaves, but skilled artisans were needed for building aqueducts and leats as well as the machinery needed to dewater mines and to crush and separate the ore from barren rock. Reverse overshot water-wheels were used to lift water, and sequences of such wheels have been found in the Spanish mines. A large section of a wheel from Rio Tinto can be seen in the British Museum, and a smaller fragment of a wheel found at Dolaucothi shows they used similar methods in Britain. The working conditions were poor, especially when using fire-setting under ground, an ancient mining method used before explosives became common. It involved building a fire against a hard rock face, then quenching the hot rock with water, so that the thermal shock cracked the rock and allowed the minerals to be extracted. The method is described by Diodorus Siculus when he discussed the gold mines of Ancient Egypt in the first century BC, and at a much later date by Georg Agricola in his De Re Metallica of the 16th century. Every attempt was made to ventilate the deep mines, by driving many long adits for example, so as to ensure adequate air circulation. The same adits also served to drain the workings.

The company is located in ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Sgt. Esguerra Ave., Quezon City. The company is majority-owned by the heirs of Arcadio M. Carandang, one of the pioneers of Philippine television who worked for ABS-CBN. At present, AMCARA owns and operates a number of UHF television stations in the provinces affiliated with ABS-CBN Sports and Action (S+A). History =1992-1996: Ermita Electronics Corporation era= AMCARA Broadcasting Network, Inc. was incorporated on April 11, 1994. The station was acquired from Ermita Electronics Corporation in July 1996, which initially owned the frequency of the station that began airing in May 1992 from a densely populated commercial area in Quezon City with a rebroadcast of MTV Asia, then telecasting from the STAR TV platform. It was later showing Channel [V] refeeds from 1994 onwards as MTV made the decision to split from STAR and form its own satellite TV portal in Asia. =1996-2010: AMCARA Broadcasting Network era= Three years later in 1996, MTV Asia returned to the Philippine airwaves after establishing a new regional base in Singapore. ABS-CBN was picked as the broadcast arm of MTV Asia in the Philippines at the time, and Channel 23 started test broadcasts in September 1996 with rebroadcasts of the new MTV Asia from Singapore. A month later, it launched its own programming under the station name Studio 23 and adopted the slogan \\"Premium Television\\". The station initially ran MTV rebroadcasts in the day, and ran its own shows at prime time. It also ran for 24 hours, but financial limitations forced it to sign off at 3AM every day. That has been the broadcast arrangement ever since. 5 years later, MTV Asia acquired a new local UHF frequency and Studio 23 formally became a full station, adopting rebroadcasts of its in-house cable channel Myx to fill in the void left by MTV Asia, and came up with intensified programming led by the popular reality TV game show \\"Survivor\\", and several top rate US shows like \\"7th Heaven\\", \\"Will and Grace\\" and \\"Charmed\\", among others. By 2004, the channel opened its doors to Taglish programs. It also by that time adopted a new slogan, \\"Kabarkada Mo!\\". Previous to this trend, the station was already running its own English newscast, \\"News Central\\", from 2001 to 2010, effectively replacing the network's \\"The World Tonight\\", previously on Channel 2 which had gone on to be a cable-only newscast of ANC, a cable channel of ABS-CBN. It also geared its mostly young viewers to trends in the tech world with \\"Digital World\\". With the intensified Taglish presence, Studio 23 today now has the nightly Tagalog gag newscast \\"Wazzup Wazzup\\", the interactive youth talk show \\"Y-Speak\\", and several others. It even provided support shows to its highly successful local reality programs \\"Pinoy Big Brother\\" and \\"Pinoy Dream Academy\\", both acquired from Endemol of the Netherlands and are big hits on Channel 2. =Expansion to sports programming= In 1998, ABS-CBN, through its sports division, ABS-CBN Sports, used mainly Studio 23 to highlight its own professional basketball league, the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA). The league adopted the home and away format used by the American professional league the National Basketball Association (NBA). (It however sold the franchise of the league after incurring heavy losses.) It marked the network's first serious foray into sports programming. Later, that would be added by acquiring broadcast rights to the collegiate leagues UAAP and NCAA and the PBL. Today, it carries a wide variety of local sporting competition, many of which involved neighborhood schools and showcasing budding Filipino sports talents. =2010-2014: Part of ABS-CBN, rebranded as Studio 23 Network= The date was brought forward and ABS-CBN Corporation's acquisition of a 49% controlling stake in AMCARA Broadcasting Network ended on March 22, 2010. On July 12, 2010, ABS-CBN Corporation announced the formation of its broadcast television subsidiary, officially named Studio 23 Network. The AMCARA name will be cease to be used as a terrestrial broadcaster as well as blocktimer agreement, though existing AMCARA Broadcasting Network studios will keep the name. On October 23, 2010, ABS-CBN Corporation officially announced that the integration of their UHF TV network operations as well as AMCARA Broadcasting Network has been completed and the two entities will merge into one under the name of Studio 23 Network and will operate under the business name of Studio 23, Inc. On January 16, 2014, Studio 23 ceased its commercial broadcast and rebranded as ABS-CBN Sports and Action on January 18, 2014. =2014-2019: Studio 23 goes off the air and rebranded as ABS-CBN Sports+Action= ABS-CBN Sports and Action, stylized as ABS-CBN Sports+Action or S+A, is a Filipino free-to-air sports and action channel. It is managed by ABS-CBN Sports, ABS-CBN Corporation's sports content division. The channel occupied the former channel space of Studio 23, a young adult-oriented network ceasing operations on January 16, 2014. It began its operations on January 18, 2014. =2019-present: Divestiture, franchise renewal and block-time issues= On January 24, 2019, ABS-CBN divested its 49% stake in AMCARA to one of the majority shareholders Rodrigo V. Carandang (who is also the chief of TV5 Network engineering). ABS-CBN has also stopped paying blocktime fees to AMCARA, based on their 2019 third- quarter financial report. Carandang was named Chairman, while former GMA Network vice-president Jose Antonio Veloso was named as president. On June 29, 2020, during the joint hearing made by the House Franchises and Good Government committees, ABS-CBN President and CEO, Carlo Katigbak made their speech, reiterating the block-time arrangement between ABS-CBN and AMCARA, saying that was done under the standard commercial agreement. Later on, Cavite 7th District representative and Senior Deputy Majority Leader, Jesus Crispin Remulla, called the block-time arrangement, \\"usufruct.\\" and a dummy relationship.

The station was on the air from 1953 to 1969, with a hiatus from 1955 to 1958. History =Challenge= The station first signed on the air in December 1953 as WWOR-TV (no relation to the current New York City station that is licensed to Secaucus, New Jersey), operating as the second independent station in the Boston area. The station's transmitter was located on Asnebumskit Hill in Paxton. It also carried secondary affiliations with ABC and DuMont, and also cleared whatever NBC programs that WBZ-TV (channel 4, now a CBS owned-and-operated station) declined to air. Unfortunately, WWOR had signed on just after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened the UHF band for broadcasting use, and television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability (Congress later passed the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1961, with UHF tuners beginning to be included on all newer sets as a result of its implementation by 1964). Even with the use of an expensive converter, WWOR's signal was marginal at best. No one was willing to advertise on a station that was barely viewable, and channel 14 went dark September 5, 1955. In 1958, WWOR's owners, Salisbury Broadcasting, merged with Springfield Television Corporation, owner of NBC affiliate WWLP-TV in Springfield. The station returned to the air December 1 as a satellite of WWLP. It was only on the air for six hours a day to protect WBZ-TV. After six years, Springfield Television decided to turn channel 14 into a Boston-focused independent station once again, under new call letters, WJZB (named for WWLP staffer _J_ ohn _Z._ _B_ uckley). In the 1960s, it began airing Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics games (from WHDH-TV in Boston), and also aired classic movies, syndicated sports programs, travelogues and other standard independent fare. It also retained a part-time NBC affiliation. =Closure= With a terrestrial footprint that covered portions of metropolitan Boston and Providence—as well as segments of eastern Connecticut—the station appeared to be on strong footing. However, the channel 14 transmitter was not capable of broadcasting in color. Additionally, the station's picture quality was marginal at best. As a result, the station found it difficult to attract advertising. The station's fate was sealed in 1966, when two major events occurred: first, Storer Broadcasting bought struggling independent WIHS-TV (channel 38) and changed its call letters to WSBK-TV (now a CBS owned MyNetworkTV affiliate). Secondly, a joint venture of Kaiser Broadcasting and the Boston Globe purchased WXHR-TV (channel 56, formerly WTAO-TV; now WLVI), which had been off the air for a decade, and returned the station to the air that December. Although Boston was big enough on paper to support three independent stations, WJZB's technical problems proved too much to overcome. The station limped along for another year, until Springfield Television cut back its schedule to 90 minutes a day, the minimum required to cover the license. The station signed on at 6 p.m. and signed off at 7:30 p.m., its sole programs being WWLP's evening newscasts and The Huntley- Brinkley Report. In 1968, Springfield Television announced the sale of WJZB to Buckley and his new corporation, Evans Broadcasting. Buckley planned significant upgrades, including a new color transmitter capable of 1 million watts of power. However, before Buckley could close on the purchase, the studio and transmitter were destroyed by fire in May 1969. When it was apparent the station would never return to the air, Springfield Television surrendered the license to the FCC, which deleted it in February 1970, with its frequency reassigned to two-way radio and land mobile use. In 1971, it became a translator for WUNI.

History Atatürk era in Turkey.tcmb.gov.tr The grey wolf is a symbol of Turkish nationalism, as well as of Pan-Turkism. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk came to power. He introduced a language reform with the aim to \\"cleanse\\" the Turkish language of foreign influence. He also promoted the Sun Language Theory in Turkish political and educational circles from 1935. Turkish researchers at the time like Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın and Rıfat Osman Bey also came up with the idea that Early Sumerians were proto-Turks. Variants Mehmet Emin Yurdakul, Turkish nationalist writer and politician, his writings and poems had a major impact on defining the term vatan (Fatherland) Namık Kemal was one of the leading figures in creating a national identity Ideologies associated with Turkish nationalism include Pan-Turkism or Turanism (a form or ethnic or racial essentialism or national mysticism), Neo- Ottomanism (with imperial ambitions derived from the Ottoman era), Anatolianism (which considers the Turkish nation as a separate entity which developed after the Seljuk conquest of Anatolia in the 11th century), and secular, civic nationalist Kemalism. =Kemalism= Implemented by Atatürk, the founding ideology of the Republic of Turkey features nationalism () as one of its six fundamental pillars. The Kemalist revolution aimed to create a nation state from the remnants of the multi-religious and multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. Kemalist nationalism originates from the social contract theories, especially from the principles advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his Social Contract. The Kemalist perception of social contract was effected by the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire which was perceived as a product of failure of the Ottoman \\"Millet\\" system and the ineffective Ottomanism policy. Kemalist nationalism, after experiencing the Ottoman Empire's breakdown, defined the social contract as its \\"highest ideal\\". It combines secularism, chauvinism, and a cult of personality of Atatürk.https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/kemal-failed-mark-krikorian/ In the 1930s Kemalism became an all-encompassing state ideology based on his sayings and writings. The Kemalist definition of nationality was integrated to Article 66 of the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey. Legally, every citizen is defined as a Turk, regardless of ethnicity or religion. Turkish nationality law states that he or she can be deprived of his/her nationality only through an act of treason.https://www.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.23943/princeton/9780691175829.001.0001/upso-9780691175829-chapter-008 Kemalist nationalism believes in the principle that the Turkish state is an indivisible whole comprising its territory and people, which is defined as the \\"unity of the state\\". =Pan-Turkism= \\"Turanist\\" nationalism began with the Turanian Society founded in 1839, followed in 1908 with the Turkish Society, which later became the Turkish Hearths and eventually expanded to include ideologies such as Pan-Turanism and Pan-Turkism. The Young Turk Revolution which overthrew Sultan Abdul Hamid II, brought Turkish nationalists to power in the Ottoman Empire, eventually leading to the Three Pashas' control of the late Ottoman government.Ayşe Hür, Mustafa Kemal ve muhalifleri (1), Radikal, February 18, 2007.Guy E.

In the early Republican era, some intellectuals like Hilmi Ziya Ülken and Nurettin Topçuhttps://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/topcu-nurettin proposed that the origins of the Turkish nationalism should be sought in Anatolia, not in \\"Turan\\".Identity, Culture and Globalization - Annals of the International Institute of Sociology, , , pg. 182 - 183. Hilmi Ziya Ülken, one of the founders of Anatolianism, was opposed to Neo-Ottomanism and Pan- Islamism, as well as to Turanism. In 1919, Ülken wrote a book titled Anadolunun Bugünki Vazifeleri (Present Duties of Anatolia), but it was not published. Ülken and friends published the periodical Anadolu.

The \\"Insulting Turkishness\\" laws Turkish workers carrying the bronze head of Atatürk Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, which is perceived as being contrary to notion of freedom of speech, states \\"The person who publicly denigrates the Turkish Nation, the Republic of Turkey, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the judicial organs of the State, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to two years. But also it can be only with permission of the minister of justice\\" However, it also states that \\"Expressions of thought intended to criticize shall not constitute a crime.\\" There have been recent indications that Turkey may repeal or modify Article 301, after the embarrassment suffered by some high-profile cases. Nationalists within the judicial system, intent on derailing Turkey's full admission into the European Union, have used Article 301 to initiate trials against people like Nobel Prize–winning Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist Elif Shafak, and the late Hrant Dink for acknowledging the existence of the Armenian Genocide. In May 2007, a law was put into effect allowing Turkey to block Web sites that are deemed insulting to Atatürk.

A 3D graphic rendering software is typically used to compute the deformation caused by the non perpendicular, non-planar or even complex projection surface. Complex objects (or aggregation of multiple simple objects) create self shadows that must be compensated by using several projectors. The objects are typically replaced by neutral color ones, the projection giving all its visual properties, thus the name shader lamps. The technique can be used to create a sense of invisibility, by rendering transparency. The object is illuminated not by a replacement of its own visual properties, but by the corresponding visual surface placed behind the object as seen from an arbitrary viewing point.

Compton (born March 16, 1974) is a Filipino-born American retired basketball player and coach. He also served as the head coach of the Alaska Aces of the Philippine Basketball Association. Early life and college career Born in Makati in the Philippines, Compton and his family spent a year in northeastern Thailand when he was ten years old. His parents, both Southeast Asian Studies scholars, were researchers there. He moved to Madison from upstate New York in 1988, when his parents began working at the University of Wisconsin. He was a starting guard on the 1992 Madison West High School basketball squad. There he teamed up with Mike Dammen to lead the school's only state championship team since 1945. Although he dreamed of playing in a foreign league, he had no clue how to get to one until his junior year at Cornell. When a coach heard that he was born in the Philippines, he told Compton that he could play on a team in the Philippine Basketball Association. He found an agent, who arranged for him to join a team in July 1997, after graduation. Playing career Compton played four seasons in the defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association with the Manila Metrostars and the Batangas Blades. He won the 1999 MBA Most Valuable Player award when the Metrostars won the national title, and won another championship with the Blades in 2001. By the time the MBA folded in 2002, Compton was a fixture in Philippine basketball and fully assimilated into the culture. However, he still could not play in the PBA due to the league's eligibility rules, which do not allow naturalized Filipino citizens to play. Instead, he appeared on television as a basketball analyst, but did play for a short period of time for the Welcoat Dragons in the PBA. Compton also got an exception from the Philippine Basketball League. He played for the Sunkist-UST Tigers and the Montaña Pawnshop Jewels from 2002–2006. He led the Jewels to its only PBL crown in the 2005 PBL Open Championship. Coaching career In the 2006–07 PBA Philippine Cup, Compton was hired as one of the assistant coaches of the Dragons before being allowed by the PBA to play as the team's second import for the 2007 and 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference, his only PBA appearance as a player. He was elevated to the assistant head coaching position with the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters from 2006 to 2009. He then moved over to Powerade Tigers as assistant to Bo Perasol until its last conference in 2012.http://www.philstar.com/sports/782685/something-special-powerade After the Powerade franchise was sold to GlobalPort, he became assistant to Luigi Trillo of Alaska. He helped the squad win the 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup, their 14th title and the first in the post-Tim Cone era.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/309236/sports/opinion/pba-the-alaska- aces-won-it-the-right-way Two games into the 2014 PBA Governors' Cup, he was appointed the head coach of Alaska Aces, replacing Luigi Trillo.http://www.spin.ph/basketball/news/unlike-todd-purves-alaskas-alex- compton-can-be-officially-designated-coach-in-pba.-heres-why In his first head coaching stint, he led the Aces to the semi-finals, losing to Rain or Shine in full five games.http://www.alaskaaces.com.ph/v3/coach-compton-says-alaska- aces-will-focus-preparation-on-defense In the following season, he steered the Aces to the 2014-15 Philippine Cup Finals, only to lose to San Miguel Beermen in seven games. He also guided the Aces to the 2015 Governors' Cup Finals only to be swept by the Beermen in four games. In a rematch of the previous season's Philippine Cup Finals, the Beermen once again beat the Alaska Aces in 7 games, completing the Beermen's historic comeback from down 0-3 to win the series. National team In 2015, Compton was invited by Philippines men's national basketball team head coach Tab Baldwin to be one of his coaching staff as assistant coach.

He appears in Book 3 of François Rabelais' Pantagrueline chronicles. He appears in Victor Hugo's Le Roi s'amuse and its opera version, Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto, a blend of \\"Triboulet\\" and French rigoler (to laugh), intended to deflect the censorship that Hugo's work had received. A triboulet, a jester dressed entirely in red, is a character associated with the carnival of Monthey in Switzerland. Attributed famous quotes Portrait, c.1550 Triboulet once came to the Monarch with a complaint. :Triboulet: \\"A noble has threatened to hang me!\\" :The Monarch: \\"Don't worry! If he hangs you I'll have him beheaded fifteen minutes later.\\" :Triboulet: \\"Well, would it be possible to behead him 15 minutes before?\\" Once, Triboulet could not contain himself and slapped the monarch on the bum. The monarch lost his temper and threatened to execute Triboulet. A bit later, the monarch calmed down a little and promised to forgive Triboulet if he could think of an apology more insulting than the offending deed. A few seconds later, Triboulet responded: \\"I'm so sorry, your majesty, that I didn't recognize you! I mistook you for the Queen!\\" Death Having broken an order from Francis I forbidding Triboulet from making jokes on the queen and her courtiers, the king ordered that he should be put to death. Having served the king particularly well for many years, Francis I granted Triboulet the right to choose the way he would die. Triboulet, with his sharp mind, said the following: \\"Bon sire, par sainte Nitouche et saint Pansard, patrons de la folie, je demande à mourir de vieillesse.\\" which translates to: \\"Good sire, for Saint Nitouche's and Saint Pansard's sake, patrons of insanity, I choose to die from old age.\\" Having no other choice than to laugh, the king ordered that Triboulet must not be executed, but rather instead be banished from the realm.

Shortliffe is a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. He was the principal developer of the clinical expert system MYCIN, one of the first rule-based artificial intelligence expert systems, which obtained clinical data interactively from a physician user and was used to diagnose and recommend treatment for severe infections. While never used in practice (because it preceded the era of local-area networking and could not be integrated with patient records and physician workflow), its performance was shown to be comparable to and sometimes more accurate than that of Stanford infectious disease faculty.1\\\\. Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project -(edited by Bruce G. Buchanan and Edward H. Shortliffe; ebook version http://www.aaaipress.org/Classic/Buchanan/buchanan.html ) This spurred the development of a wide range of activity in the development of rule-based expert systems, knowledge representation, belief nets and other areas, and its design greatly influenced the subsequent development of computing in medicine. He is also regarded as a founder of the field of biomedical informatics, and in 2006 received one of its highest honors, the Morris F. Collen Award given by the American College of Medical Informatics. He has held administrative positions in academic medicine, research and national bodies including the Institute of Medicine, American College of Physicians, the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Library of Medicine (NLM), and been influential in the development of medicine, computing and biomedical informatics nationally and internationally. His interests include the broad range of issues related to integrated medical decision-support systems and their implementation, biomedical informatics and medical education and training, and the Internet in medicine. In March 2007, he became founding dean of the University of Arizona's College of Medicine - Phoenix campus. He stepped down from this position in May 2008 and in January 2009 transferred his primary academic appointment to Arizona State University where he became professor of biomedical informatics. He maintained a secondary appointment as professor of basic medical sciences and of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine (Phoenix Campus). In November 2009 he transferred his academic home to a part-time appointment as professor at the School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he lived until November 2011. Since that time he has returned to New York City, where he continues as an adjunct professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia University. In July 2009, Shortliffe assumed a position as president and chief executive officer of the American Medical Informatics Association, an organization that he helped to form between 1988 and 1990 when he was President of the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care. In late 2011 he announced his intention to step down from this position in 2012.  Biography and career  Shortliffe grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, until his family moved to Connecticut when he was 6. He attended the Loomis School in Connecticut (now Loomis Chaffee School) and later Gresham's School in the United Kingdom. His father was a physician and hospital administrator; his mother, an English teacher. He has one brother and one sister. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he started working in the computer laboratory of G. Octo Barnett at Massachusetts General Hospital and realized that he could have a career spanning both medicine and computing. After receiving an AB in applied mathematics magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1970, he received an M.D. (1976) and Ph.D. in Medical Information Systems (1975) from Stanford University, with a dissertation on the MYCIN system, for which he also won the 1976 Grace Murray Hopper Award for outstanding computer scientists under the age of 30. He completed internal medicine house-staff training from 1976-1979 at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford Hospital. In 1979 he joined the Stanford faculty in internal medicine and computer science, where he directed the Stanford University Medical EXpertimental computer resource (SUMEX) and subsequently the Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford (CAMIS), continuing his work on expert systems, including ONCOCIN (an oncology decision support program), T-HELPER, and other projects in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project.Clancey WJ, Shortliffe EH, eds. Readings in medical artificial intelligence:the first decade. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1984 He also simultaneously served as chief of general internal medicine and associate chair of medicine for primary care, and was principal investigator of the InterMed Collaboratory, which developed the science of computable guidelines for medical decision support.

The studios were located at 802 1/2 E. Fillmore Avenue. The station was sold to the Western Broadcasting Company, owners of KPIK 1580, in 1966 and became KPIK-FM. The FM station simulcast KPIK, making it just the second all-country music station on FM in the United States. The AM and FM stations remained a simulcast through 1977, when the FM moved toward a more contemporary country sound as \\"Super K-94\\" (coinciding with a move to 93.9 MHz, where it was located from 1977 to 1994) while the AM station focused on more traditional country. That same year, station manager George James was elected to the Colorado Springs city council. In 1978, George James bought KPIK, while the FM was sold separately to the KILO Broadcasting Corporation. The month before, it had adopted a metric system-themed moniker, KILO. =Active rock= By the 1980s, KILO had moved to an active rock format. The station is known for playing new bands well before many other stations will add them to their playlist and is usually one of the higher rated stations in Colorado Springs, always in the top five.

She was the second woman to represent Georgia in the United States House of Representatives.  Life  Mankin was born September 11, 1896, in Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia. She grew up there, attending public and private schools. She graduated with an A.B. from Rockford College, Rockford, Illinois, in 1917. She graduated with an LL.B. from Atlanta Law School, Atlanta, Georgia, in 1920. During and after the First World War, Mankin served as an ambulance driver in the American Women's Hospital Unit No. 1, a Red Cross unit attached to the French army in 1918 and 1919. She was there as a civilian and was not officially a military veteran. After the war and earning her law degree, Mankin entered private practice as an attorney in Atlanta, Georgia. She entered politics, and served as a Democratic member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1937 until 1946.Georgia Encyclopedia- Helen Douglas Mankin In 1946, Mankin was elected as a Democrat to represent the fifth congressional district of Georgia in the 79th United States Congress, filling the seat left vacant by the resignation of Robert Ramspeck. She took her seat February 12, 1946. She was an unsuccessful candidate in that year's Democratic Party primary election when she sought renomination to run for reelection. She won the popular vote, gaining major support from Atlanta's African-American community, but lost in the county unit system, a voting system similar to the presidential electoral college that Georgia then used for primary elections. The county-unit system gave disproportionate weight to the votes of rural counties, severely discounting the votes of large urban areas, such as Atlanta's Fulton County. Mankin then was an unsuccessful write- in candidate in the general election of 1946. Mankin's term of office concluded January 3, 1947.

Before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, Ayiti, now known as the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic) was divided into five kingdoms (Xaragua, Maguana, Higuey, Magua and Marien). Anacaona was born into a family of chiefs, and was the sister of Bohecio, the chief of Xaragua. She succeeded her brother Bohechio as chief of the Xaragua after his death. Under Anacaona's rule, the Spaniard settlers and Xaragua people coexisted and intermarried. In 1503, during his visit to Xaragua, governor of the island Nicolas Ovando suspected an insurrection among the present Taino chiefs including Anacaona. Ovando gave the order for the chiefs to be captured and burned, and Anacaona was arrested and hanged. Early Life and Family Anacaona was born in Yaguana, the capital of Xaragua (present day Léogâne, Haiti) in 1474 (?). Her name was derived from the Taíno words ana, meaning 'flower', and caona, meaning 'gold, golden.' Anacaona's brother Bohechío was a local chieftain and under his rule, Bohecio consolidated power over all territories west of Xaragua in 1475. Through consolidation, to strengthen his political influence, Bohecio married Anacaona to Caonabo, the chieftain of Maguana.Hoeg, Jerry (2015-09-02). \\"Manuel de Jesús Galván's Enriquillo: A novel look at the environment of marriage in the first colony\\".

In 1492, Christopher Columbus arrived in the kingdom of Marien (Northern Haiti), in search of a direct route to the Indies (India). Upon arrival, he was greeted by Tainos, who were much smaller in stature compared to the Spanish. Columbus was greeted with gold, corn and other natural resources. In 1493, the Spanish crown established colonies to excavate gold and other minerals. With the establishment of the new colony, the Taino were kidnapped, murdered, raped, and enslaved to satisfy the needs of the Spanish crown. In 1493, Caonabo was arrested for ordering the destruction of La Navidad (a Spanish colony) and its people. He was shipped to Spain and died in a shipwreck during the journey. When Caonabo was captured, Anacaona returned to Xaragua and served as an advisor to her brother, chief Bohecio. In 1498, Bohecio was confronted by Bartholomew Columbus, brother of Christopher Columbus (founder of the city of Santo Domingo), who arrived in Xaragua with his troops to subdue Bohecío and extend to his territory and build riches in gold. With his weakened power, Bohechío, advised by Anacaona, decided to recognize the sovereignty of the Catholic Monarchs instead of fight, and commit to pay the tribute with products as cotton, bread, corn, fish and other products. After Bohecio's death in 1500, Anacoana ruled as cacique until her execution in 1503. cacicazgos (chiefdoms) of Hispaniola at the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival 365x365px Arrest and death Massacre of the queen and her subjects, by Joos van Winghe, published in 1598 in the Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias written by Bartolomé de las Casas. In the fall of 1503, governor of Nicolas Ovando and his party of 300 traveled on foot to Xaragua. They were received in a lavish ceremony by Anacaona, her nobles, and several Taino chiefs. While the Taino presented the reception as a welcoming gesture, the Spanish who were present characterized it as an elaborate distraction. Ovando's party was under the impression that Anacoana and the present Taino chiefs were planning an insurrection. Ovanda lured the chiefs into a caney (large hut) for a Spanish tournament and gave the signal for the Spaniards to seize and bind the caciques. The caciques were burned in the caney, while other Taino of lower rank were slaughtered outside. Anacaona was arrested and hanged. According to historian Troy S. Floyd, the accounts of these events remain uncertain for many reasons. Even though the separate accounts made it seem as though it was a perfectly segregated fight between the Taino and the Spaniards, the two groups had coexisted and intermarried for six years prior. It is unclear why the Spaniards intermarried with the Taino would let them fall for the trap. Additionally, fifty Spaniards were killed which is a high number of casualties, if the events truly occurred split down ethnic lines. Finally, the Xaragua caciques were respected as some of the most intelligent on the island, and it is unlikely that they could be lured into a hut if they were planning their own revolt.  Legacy and influence  Anacaona was also a poet and composer, and is accordingly memorialized in contemporary art and literature across the Caribbean. A statue commemorating her legacy is in Leogane, Haiti (formerly Xaragua).

During the Pacific War, she participated in the Battle of Wake Island in December 1941 and the occupations of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in early 1942. Mutsuki was one of the escorts for the invasion force during the Battle of the Coral Sea in May and then participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign later that year. The ship was sunk by American bombers during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August. Design and description The Mutsuki class was an improved version of the s and was the first with triple torpedo tubes.

Their crew consisted of 150 officers and crewmen.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 143 The main armament of the Mutsuki-class ships consisted of four Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the superstructure, one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of 61-centimeter torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other was between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Four reload torpedoes were provided for the tubes. They carried 18 depth charges and could also carry 16 mines. They could also fitted with minesweeping gear.

Originally commissioned simply as Destroyer No. 19, she was assigned the name Mutsuki on 1 August 1928. In the late 1930s, Mutsuki participated in combat in China, including the First Shanghai Incident of 1932 and other actions in the Second Sino- Japanese War. =Pacific War= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Mutsuki was the flagship of Destroyer Division 30 under Destroyer Squadron 6 of the 4th Fleet. She sortied from Kwajalein on 8 December as part of the Wake Island invasion force, carrying an advance landing party of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF). Early on the morning of 11 December, the American garrison repulsed the first landing attempts by the SNLF, which was supported by the light cruisers , , and and the destroyers , , , Mutsuki, , and , two old vessels converted to patrol boats (Patrol Boat No. 32 and Patrol Boat No. 33), and two troop transports containing 450 SNLF troops. After taking heavy losses (including Kisaragi and Hayate), the Japanese force withdrew before landing. This was the first Japanese defeat of the war, and also the only occasion in World War II when an amphibious assault was repulsed by shore-based guns.Devereaux Mutsuki returned on 23 December with the second Wake Island invasion force, and again carried a SNLF advance landing party before returning to Kwajalein.Nevitt The ship escorted a convoy from Kwajalein to the naval base at Truk in January 1942, where a sponson was installed for a pair of license-built Type 93 anti- aircraft machineguns on the forward side of the bridge. Mutsuki then escorted a troop convoy from Truk to Guam later that month, and then joined the invasion of the Solomon Islands, covering the landings of Japanese forces during Operation R (the invasion of Rabaul, New Ireland and New Britain), and during Operation SR (the invasion of Lae and Salamaua on New Guinea) in January–March. From 28 March to 1 April, she served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Masao Kanazawa, commander of the 8th Special Base Force during the initial occupation of the Shortland Islands and Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. Later that month, the ship supported the occupation of the Admiralty Islands. During the Battle of the Coral Sea from 7–8 May 1942, Mutsuki was assigned to the Operation Mo invasion force for Port Moresby. After that operation was cancelled, Mutsuki remained based out of Rabaul, escorting shipping between Truk, Rabaul and Palau until recalled to Japan in July for a brief refit. After repairs were completed at Sasebo Naval Arsenal on 12 July 1942, Mutsuki was reassigned to the IJN 8th Fleet and participated in the bombardment of Henderson Field on 24 August 1942.Morison. The Struggle for Guadalcanal During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 25 August 1942, Mutsuki was sunk in an attack by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers while assisting the damaged transport Kinryu Maru, northeast of Santa Isabel island. Mutsuki took a direct bomb hit in her engineering section, killing 41 crewmen and injuring 11 more. Yayoi took on the survivors, which included her captain, Lt. Cdr. Kenji Hatano.

The district's mascot is the Viking.  History  The Perkiomen Valley School District was formed in 1969 through the merger of the Perkiomen Joint School District and the Schwenksville Union School District. Perkiomen Joint School District was, itself, a consolidation of Collegeville, Trappe, and Skippack Township (served by the former Collegeville-Trappe High School), while Schwenksville Union School District had unified Schwenksville, Lower Frederick Township, and Perkiomen Township (served by the former Schwenksville High School). Its mascot and distinctive colors of orange and brown were elected by the students in the spring of 1969, after the merger was announced. (Collegeville-Trappe had the Colonel and colors of red and gold, and Schwenksville, the Bluebird, with blue and white.) Some alumni believe that the new mascot and colors were chosen by the administration – for some unexplained reason – without regard to the election results. Perkiomen Valley High School, then housed in what had been the Collegeville-Trappe High School building, and the former Perkiomen Valley Junior High School, housed at the old Schwenksville High School, opened that fall. The current high school building, at 509 Gravel Pike (Pennsylvania Route 29), Graterford, Perkiomen Township (Collegeville postal address), opened in the fall of 1976.

He is also the Jean and E. Floyd Kvamme Associate Professor of Politics and Law. In April 2014, Captain Iglesias retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps after 30 years of active and reserve service. He was appointed by President George W. Bush as the United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico in August 2001 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in October 2001. He was one of eight U.S. attorneys fired by the Bush administration in 2006 for \\"performance-related issues.\\" (see Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy). A review of the matter released by the U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General in October 2008 found that his firing had not been performance-related but was politically motivated.An Investigation Into the Removal of Nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006  Department of Justice, pgs. 190-192 In October 2008, Iglesias was re-activated by the Navy as part of a special prosecution team for Guantanamo detainees suspected of committing terrorism and war crimes. He supervised the conviction of the U.S. v. Noor Uthman terrorism case; one of only six completed war crimes cases since the Commissions were re-established.

Iglesias in an interview with Tavis Smiley, said that he was for: \\"smaller government, less taxes, personal responsibility, and government restraint.\\" He added, \\"Only problem is, our leaders haven't been practicing that.

Weh was dissatisfied with Iglesias due in part to his failure to indict New Mexico State Senator Manny Aragon (D) on fraud and conspiracy charges.

In a plea bargain, Aragon pleaded guilty to three felony fraud counts. Iglesias testified before Congress in March 2007, stating that Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.) called and urged him to rush indictments against Aragon prior to the November 2006 election. In October 2006, when Sen.

Iglesias replied, \\"Yes, and to use a Star Wars kind of imagery, I thought I was working with the Jedi Knights, and I was working for the Sith Lords.\\"Video from thedailyshow.com. In October 2008, a report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General found that Iglesias had been wrongfully dismissed because he had refused to pursue prosecutions against the Democrat-linked community organization ACORN and a prominent New Mexico Democrat. \\"The real reasons for Iglesias' removal were the complaints from New Mexico Republican politicians and party activists about how Iglesias handled voter fraud and public corruption cases in the state,\\" the report says. The Inspector General's report says that Senator Domenici's complaints were the \\"primary\\" reason Iglesias was fired. In July 2010, Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firing was inappropriately political, but not criminal, saying \\"Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias.

The party revolved around the political leadership of Obafemi Awolowo, a sometimes polemical politician but effective administrator. However, the party's main difference with its competitors was not the leader but the ideals of a social democracy it was founded on. The UPN inherited its ideology from the old Action Group and saw itself as a party for everyone. It was the only party to promote free education and called itself a welfarist party. The desired goal of the military government of Olusegun Obasanjo to build national political parties led to a gradual weakening of ethnic politics in the second republic. The UPN as well as the People's Redemption Party (PRP) presented the most coherent plan of action during the electioneering campaign of 1979. The party jettisoned building a coalition of comfort in a polarized political environment but based partnerships on the cooperation of like minded advocates of democratic socialism. The Action Congress of Nigeria was regarded as a natural successor to the Action Group and UPN.

He is regarded as the ancestor of the noble House of Grey, branches of which held many peerage and other titles in England, including Baron Grey de Wilton (1295), Baron Ferrers of Groby (1299), Baron Grey of Codnor (1299, 1397), Baron Grey de Ruthyn (1324), Earl of Tankerville (1419, 1695), Earl of Huntingdon (1471), Marquess of Dorset (1475), Baron Grey of Powis (1482), Duke of Suffolk (1551), Baronet Grey of Chillingham (1619); Baron Grey of Werke (1623/4), Earl of Stamford (1628), Viscount Glendale (1695), Baronet Grey of Howick (1746), Baron Walsingham (1780), Baron Grey of Howick (1801); Viscount Howick (1806), Earl Grey (1806), Baronet Grey of Fallodon (1814), etc., which married into the royal family and which continues to this day. Lady Jane Grey (c. 1537-1554) \\"the Nine Days' Queen\\", was a member of this family. Landholdings Radford...\\") In his Latinised name of Anschtallus de Grai (misspelling for Anschetillus) he is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the lord of six Oxfordshire manors,http://opendomesday.org/name/85000/ansketil-of-graye/ all held from William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford (c.1020-1071), lord of the manor of Breteuil, in Normandy, a relative and close counsellor of William the Conqueror, whose chief residence was Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, one of many English castles he built. The manors held by Anchetil de Greye were as follows: *Black Bourton, Bampton hundred, Oxfordshire; *Brighthampton, Bampton hundred, Oxfordshire; *Rotherfield Greys, Binfield hundred, Oxfordshire; *Cornwell, Shipton hundred, Oxfordshire; *Radford, Shipton hundred, Oxfordshire; *Woodleys, Wootton hundred, Oxfordshire; The principal estate granted to Anchetil de Greye in England was Redrefield (subsequently Rotherfield Greys), the manor house of which is today represented by Greys Court, now in South Oxfordshire.Open Domesday Online: Ansketil de Graye, accessed January 2017Crossley & Currie, 1996, pages 180-183 Anchetil was also the tenant of Standlake,Open Domesday Online: Brighthampton, accessed January 2017 seemingly a part of Brighthampton.Standlake not listed in Domesday Book, but situated near Brighthampton Origins Greye's origins in Normandy are unclear, although it is believed he came from the vicinity of today's Graye- sur-Mer (Calvados, Graieum 1086, Graia 1172, Gray 1183Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France, Librairie Guénégaud 1979. p. 340.) which would have been within the domain of William I. It is likely that Anchetil de Greye was of Norse ancestry in whole or in part since the given name Anchetil (from Ásketíll \\"God-Cauldron\\") was a fairly common Norse-origin name in Normandy. The \\"Greye\\" in his name then was either simply a reference to his estate, or to his mixed Scandinavian-Frankish ancestry which was also common in Normandy by the time of the invasion of England. His immediate ancestry is uncertain, but some researchers believe he was the son of a certain Hugh Fitz Turgis,De Ste-Marie, 1842, page not cited that means \\"Turgis' son\\" (from Thorgisl \\"hostage of Thor\\"), another clue he was from Normandy. More than 20 superficially distinct instances of Anschitil, Anschil, Anschetil, etc. in early Norman documents must refer to a far smaller number of distinct individuals. Particularly interesting is Anschitil de Ros. According to Domesday Monachorum he was the feudal landlord, under the Bishop of Bayeux, of Craie, another Craie, and Croctune (or Crawton). These three places are in the Cray valley of Kent, which was in Norman times the foremost site of chalk mining from deneholes, on a scale rivalled only by the Hangman's Wood cluster of deneholes on the other side of the Thames in Grays. Cray and Grey seem to be almost interchangeable in Kent place names. Cray passed from Anglo-Norman French into English as a word for \\"chalk\\", while greye is one of the wide range of French regional dialect words for \\"chalk\\". In Normandy, Grai is modern Graye-sur-Mer, and Ros is modern Rots, on the outskirts of Caen about away. Between them, on the river Seulles, at Orival near Creully, lies an ancient quarry where building stone is said to have been dug and lime burned since Gallo-Roman times. One of the key resources found in chalk mines is flint, which was used for tools, construction and making fire. Whether Anschetil de Grai and Anschitil de Ros were two persons or one, they/he must have known about and profited from the digging and shipping of limestone in Normandy, so it is at least curious that they/he picked chalk-digging areas for their new feudal domains in England. Descendants He was the great- grandfather of John de Grey, Bishop of Norwich, and probably also of Henry de Grey, and the great-great-grandfather of Walter de Grey, Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor of England.

Early life The eight Li brothers in Beijing, 1930. C.Y. Lee (left) was the youngest. Chin Yang Lee (Li Jinyang) was born in 1915 into a scholarly family in Xiangtan, Hunan, China, the youngest of the eight Li brothers who all achieved national or international fame. His eldest brother, Li Jinxi, was the \\"father of the Chinese phonetic alphabet\\" and teacher of Mao Zedong. The second oldest, Li Jinhui, was a pioneering musician considered the \\"father of Chinese popular music\\". He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from National Southwestern Associated University in 1942. After working as a secretary for a maharajah at the China–Burma border, Lee emigrated to the United States in 1943, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After briefly attending Columbia University, Lee earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in playwriting from Yale University in 1947. Lee was a journalist living in and working for two San Francisco Chinatown newspapers, Chinese World and Young China at the time, in the early 1950s, when he was writing Flower Drum Song, expanding it from a short story to a novel. The Flower Drum Song By the 1950s, Lee was barely making a living writing short stories and working as a Chinese teacher, translator and journalist for San Francisco Chinatown newspapers.Shin, Andrew. \\"'Forty Percent Is Luck': An Interview with C. Y. (Chin Yang) Lee\\". MELUS, vol. 29, no. 2, Elusive Illusions: Art and Reality (Summer, 2004), pp. 77–104, The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States. Retrieved December 3, 2010 He had hoped to break into playwriting, but instead wrote a novel about Chinatown, The Flower Drum Song (originally titled Grant Avenue). Lee initially had no success selling his novel, but his agent submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar, Straus and Cudahy. The firm sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation. The reader was found dead in bed, the manuscript beside him with the words \\"Read this\\" scrawled on it. The publishing house did so, and bought Lee's novel, which became a bestseller in 1957.Lewis, p. 28 The novel, about generational conflict within an Asian American family over an arranged marriage in San Francisco's Chinatown, was adapted into the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Flower Drum Song, opening in 1958. The original production was the first Broadway show to feature Asian American players. The 1961 film jump-started the careers of the first generation of Asian American actors, including Nancy Kwan, James Shigeta, and Jack Soo. Lee was interviewed on the 2006 DVD release of the movie. On October 2, 2001, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles premiered David Henry Hwang's adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Flower Drum Song to glowing reviews, in the first major theatrical production that had an all- Asian cast of actors and voices. Its initial run was extended, and after several months, the production moved to Broadway, where the reviews were less than stellar. Lee had worked with Hwang on the rewriting of the musical. Personal life Lee married Joyce Lackey, an American writer, in 1963. They had two children, Angela and Jay. Joyce died in 1997. In his later life Lee lived in Alhambra, California. On November 8, 2018, he died of kidney failure in Los Angeles, at the age of 102.

Containing an outline of the envisioned core requirements, it provides the contractual basis for the more detailed technical requirements. It is much shorter and more general than a product requirements document or a marketing requirements document, which outline the specific product plan and marketing plan respectively.  Purpose  The Vision document provides a high-level executive summary for a project or other undertaking. For software development, for example, a Vision captures the essence of the envisioned solution in the form of high-level requirements and design constraints that provide stakeholders an overview of the system to be developed from a behavioral requirements perspective. A Vision document provides input to the project approval process and is, therefore, closely related to the Business case. It communicates the fundamental \\"why and what\\" for the project and is a gauge against which all future decisions should be validated. A Vision document generally contains some or all of the following: * Revision History * Signature Page * Introduction * Purpose Statement * Scope Statement * Problem Statement (What is being solved by the Vision?) * Business Needs/Requirements * Product/Solution Overview * Major Features (Optional) * Stakeholder Register * Budgetary Details (Rough Order of Magnitude, ROM) * Assumptions * Definitions * Process Details  Timing  The Vision is created early in the Inception phase. It should evolve steadily during the earlier portion of the lifecycle, with changes slowing during Construction. It evolves in conjunction with the Business case and is meant to be revised as the understanding of requirements, architecture, plans, and technology evolves. The Vision serves as input to use case modeling, and is updated and maintained as a separate artifact throughout the project. For agile projects, the Product Vision can feed into the user story development.

Construction began in 2003 and was opened in 2006. For a period was known as the Wells Fargo Amphitheater. It is used for concerts, stage shows and other special events. History In April 2002, the then President of Wells Fargo Bank, Gary Lawrence, gave $500,000 to contribute to the renovation and creation of a first class open air amphitheater in Lubbock's Mackenzie Park. In 1999 Lubbock voters had already approved $1.7 million for the construction of an Amphitheater at Mackenzie Park, but after construction adjustments requirements had reason to $2.7 million. The donation left a requirement for another $500,000 to ensure complete funding. In June of 2003 a further $150,000 was donated by Dallas based oil company Alon-Fina. Construction of the venue began in 2003 with the remaining money required to complete the project coming from other private donations while work was already under way. Opening The amphitheater was opened in August of 2006 with an eight performance run of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Oklahoma! put on by what was then known as Lubbock Moonlight Musicals. Since then the amphitheater has hosted almost 40 further productions put on by the now re- branded Moonlight Musicals group.

The original property was larger than the current one, at one time encompassing and extending north to Boyd Street and west to North Street, an urban farmstead with main house, barn, detached kitchen, smokehouse, greenhouse, and other outbuildings. Three generations of the Boyd family lived at The Oaks, from 1853 until 1960. Mrs. Eliza Ellis Boyd outlived her husband by many years and lived in the house until her death in 1902. Daughter Mary and her husband, Richard F. McGill, lived in the house with their two children.

Jeter was part of the Packer teams that won an unprecedented three consecutive NFL championship games and the first two Super Bowls. Herb Adderley and Jeter formed one of the greatest cornerback duos in football history. During this time, Packers defense led the league in fewest points allowed in 1965 and , fewest total yards allowed in 1964 and 1967, and fewest passing yards allowed from 1964 to 1968.

His nomination was superseded by the School of Journalism's choice of Peterkin's book. Evidently in protest, Burton resigned from the jury. Ethel Barrymore had the dramatic rights to the novel, and in 1930 starred on Broadway in a blackface performance, whose cast included Estelle Winwood and Barrymore's teenaged daughter, Ethel Barrymore Colt, in her stage debut. Synopsis Scarlet Sister Mary is set among the Gullah people of the Low Country in South Carolina. The date is never clearly established, but appears to be around the beginning of the 20th century. The title character, Mary, was an orphan on an abandoned plantation who was raised by Auntie Maum Hannah and her crippled son Budda Ben.

Centuries ago, an alien race known as the Lamia arrived on Earth. Amoral scientists, they viewed humanity as nothing more than experimental subjects. The literal translation of their name for humans is lab rats. They were named Banshee because of the sound their spacecraft made. When hovering they emit a low throbbing sound akin to ', and when they take off they emit a sound like a whooshing sheeeeee. Hence the name Baaan-sheee. The Lamia has a defensive/attack ability which involves them emitting ultra-high- frequency sound from their throats, a wail which disorients and pains any humans who hear it, allowing the victims to be taken on board the ships for experimentation without resistance. It is for this reason that the 'wail of the Banshee' was associated with death, as whenever it was heard, death followed for someone nearby.

R. Hogner as part of a company drive to create buildings that looked less like gas stations and more like banks and libraries in their details, materials, and massing. The Embassy Gulf Service Station was to be Gulf Oil's 61st station within the city of Washington. Because its site was next to Rock Creek Park, the building's design was reviewed and modified somewhat by the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park Service, and the National Capital Park and Planning Commission. The final design called for a small building of grey stone similar in color to the church opposite the station; whether or not the two buildings harmonized by design is unknown.

Early Days and Education  Jacob Carruthers was born and grew up Texas and attended school at Phyllis Wheatley High School in Houston, TX, before going to Samuel Huston College where he earned a B.A in 1950. In 1951 he joined the United States Air Force (USAF) and after serving in USAF he enrolled for and earned a master's degree in government from Texas Southern University in 1958. Carruthers then went on to become the first Afrikan-American student to complete a doctorate in Political Studies from the University of Colorado in 1966. From 1961 to 1964 Carruthers taught Political Science at Prairie View College in Texas and later he taught at Kansas State College in Pittsburg, Kan.  Moving to Chicago and the Center for Inner City Studies  After two years of teaching Political Science at Kansas State College (1966-1968), Carruthers moved to Chicago where he would live and work for the rest of his life. In 1968 Carruthers joined the Center for Inner City Studies of Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU). For the next thirty-two years Carruthers taught history and education at the Center for Inner City Studies, playing a critical role in the development of the graduate and undergraduate degrees in the Department of Inner City Studies Education (ICSE). The context created by the work of Inner City Studies with such formidable minds as Anderson Thompson, Robert Starks, and Conrad Worrill would lead to the development of the Afrikan-Centered intellectual movement that would eventually be known as the Chicago School of African-Centered Thought. Several Afrikan-Centered institutions would come out of this movement, the major ones of which Carruthers would be a driving force.  Visiting Cheikh Anta Diop  In 1975, one year after Cheikh Anta Diop, the famous Afrikan scholar-scientist and his protégé and colleague Théophile Obenga successfully defended the Afrikan origin of ancient Kemet at the UNESCO symposium in Cairo, Jacob Carruthers visited Diop in Senegal. At this visit, Ifé Carruthers writes: > Diop impressed upon Dr. Carruthers the importance of the study of ancient > Egypt and more importantly the need to center that study around the command > of the Egyptian languages, commonly called hieroglyphics. Returning from this meeting Carruthers set about helping to establish the organisational base to centralise Kush and Kemet as the classical Afrikan civilisations upon which liberated Afrikan institutions would be built. Carruthers heeded the advice of Diop and immediately threw himself towards the task of learning the ancient language of Kemet, Mdw N _t_ r, so as to have a direct access to the ancient sources, while urging others to do likewise as a matter of urgency. This led to the establishment of several key Afrikan- centered study group movements.  The Kemetic Institute and ASCAC  With a solid grounding in the understanding of the cultural unity of Afrika and a command in the classical Afrikan language, Carruthers became instrumental, among a team of other Afrikan-centered scholars, in creating an Afrikan- centered context for the systematic studying of Afrikan history with the objective of raising Afrikan institutions from the rescued knowledge. In 1978 Carruthers and the African-centered research team composed of A. Josef Ben Levi, Anderson Thompson and Conrad Worrill founded the Kemetic Institute. This organization was born to address the need for serious restoration-driven search by Afrikans on the Classical Afrikan civilizations of Kush and Kemet. Carruthers, as the founding director of the Institute, consistently clarified that the institution was to serve as the springboard for Afrikan-centered institution building by proving the knowledge-base from which other institutions could be nourished. In February 1984, Carruthers along with John Henrik Clark, Asa Grant Hilliard, Leonard Jeffries, Yosef Ben-Jochannan and Maulana Karenga founded the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations (ASCAC) at the First Annual Ancient Egyptian Studies Conference in Los Angeles, California, of which Carruthers was elected the first president.  Personal life  Carruther was married to Mama Ifé Carruthers with whom he had three sons, Jacob III, Darnell and Christopher, and a daughter, Tawakalitu Jogunosimi.  Death  Jacob Carruthers died on January 4, 2004, of pancreatic cancer in his Chicago home at the age of 73.

He is a major financial supporter of Evangelical organizations in the United States and funded the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. Career  In 1970, while a store manager with variety store chain TG&Y;, Green took a $600 loan and started a home business in his garage assembling and selling miniature picture frames, with a partner, Larry Pico. The business, Greco Products, capitalized on a decorating fad of the time. Eventually, Green bought out Pico and the growing business staffed a small factory with cerebral palsy patients, paying them ten cents per frame. By August 1972, the focus was on arts and crafts, and the business had thrived to such an extent that Green and his wife were able to open a 300 square-foot store in northwest Oklahoma City called Hobby Lobby. In 1975, Green left his 13-year career with TG&Y; and opened a second Hobby Lobby location with 6,000 square feet of space.Hobby Lobby Corporate history. Hobbylobby.com. Retrieved 9 April 2013.

He asserts that he has built his business on biblical principles. Green is very supportive of Christian organizations, and is one of the largest individual donors to Evangelical causes in the United States. Green commits half of Hobby Lobby's total pretax earnings to a portfolio of evangelical ministries, and as of 2012, he had donated an estimated $500 million.David Green: The Biblical Billionaire Backing The Evangelical Movement.

The Royal Hours is celebrated only three times a year: on the Eve of the Nativity, the Eve of Theophany,If the Eve of Nativity or Theophany falls on Saturday or Sunday, the Royal Hours are chanted on the preceding Friday, and on that Friday it is not permitted to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. and Great Friday. The members of the church chant verses from the Bible which describes one powerful man's jealousy and fear during the service.The Royal Hours at Christmas Retrieved 2 April 2013 This service takes its name from the fact that it used to be officially attended by the Emperor and his court at Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Because of the presence of the Emperor, there was a special singing of \\"Many Years\\" to the Emperor, the Imperial Court, and the Hierarchy. This singing of \\"Many Years\\" continues to this day (in modified form) in cathedrals and monasteries. By his presence, the Emperor acknowledged his submission to Christ the true King. The three holy days on which the Royal Hours are celebrated were chosen as days in the church year which most particularly demonstrate Jesus' kenosis (self-emptying), and thus His true royal majesty. According to Sacred Tradition, the Royal Hours of Great Friday were composed by St. Cyril (378 - 444), Patriarch of Alexandria. Although the Royal Hours are splendid, they are also penitential. On days when the Royal Hours are celebrated it is not permitted to celebrate the Divine Liturgy.The Divine Liturgy which is celebrated later on the same day is actually a Vesperal Liturgy; so, liturgically speaking, the next day has actually begun before the Liturgy is celebrated. The Royal Hours is an aggregate of five services, all served together as one: *First Hour *Third Hour *Sixth Hour *Ninth Hour *Typica For the Royal Hours, the priest vests in EpitrachelionIn the Russian Practice, the priest also wears the Epimanikia. and Phelonion, and the deacon vests fully in Sticharion, Orarion and Epimanikia. The Holy Doors and Curtain are open for most of the service, and the Gospel Book is placed on an analogion (lectern) in the center of the Temple (church). At the beginning of each Hour the priest or deacon censes the Gospel, Icons and people. When it is time to begin the First Hour, the bell is rung in the usual manner (blagovest). At the beginning of each of the succeeding Hours, the bell is struck the number of times that corresponds to the Hour (i.e., three times at the beginning of the Third Hour, six times at the beginning of the Sixth Hour, nine times at the beginning of the Ninth Hour). At the beginning of the Typica the bell is struck twelve times. At each of the Hours, one of the three fixed Psalms is replaced by a Psalm that is significant to the Feast being celebrated; the Troparion and Kontakion of the day are replaced by numerous hymns chanted by the choir; and each Hour has an Old Testament reading, a Prokeimenon, and an Epistle and Gospel. There was a service of Royal Hours for Pentecost composed by the priest Nicholas Malaxus (fl. c. 1538), and published in 1568.The Pentecostarion. Tr. Holy Transfiguration Monastery (Boston, MA), p. 15. This service, however, has not come to wide usage in the Church.

It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1930. It was adapted as a film of the same name, released in 1934. Plot The novel is set about 1914, when the first motorized vehicle was driven into Native American territory. It concerns a boy named Laughing Boy who seeks to become an adult who can be respected among his Navajo tribe. They live in a place known as T'o Tlakai. He has been initiated into tribal ways, is an accomplished jeweler, and can compete favorably at events such as racing wild horses, which he has either caught or capably traded at market. At a tribal event, Laughing Boy encounters a beautiful, mysterious young woman known as Slim Girl, and the two are soon attracted to each other. Complications arise immediately from her past experiences in the Indian Schools, boarding schools run under the auspices of the federal government for education and assimilation of Native Americans. Native American children were sent to these schools from numerous tribes, where they were forced to abandon their individual languages and cultures and instead adopt the English language and Western cultural standards. These complications affect both his family's view of the relationship, and the relationship itself in ways that slowly unfold and intertwine as the novel progresses. It offers a rare glimpse into the Navajo lifestyle and territory. The novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII. Adaptation In 1934, Laughing Boy was adapted as a film of the same name, directed by W. S. Van Dyke. It starred Ramón Novarro as Laughing Boy and Lupe Vélez as Slim Girl.

By 1630 his father arranged for him to travel to Rome, where he is said to have begun training under Poussin, and by 1632 transferring to work under Pietro da Cortona. Luigi Lanzi describes that he learned design from the former, and color from the latter.Guida di Pistoia per gli amanti delle belle arti con notizie By Francesco Tolomei, 1821, page 170. In Rome, his first known work is the fresco of the Rest on the Flight to Egypt (1632), a lunette in the chapel of the Palazzo Barberini. He competed with Camassei and Maratta for fresco commissions,F. Tolomei, page 171. including the fresco of the Vision of the Cross by Constantine the Great in the ambulatory of the baptistery of San Giovanni in Laterano. He completed this work under the guidance of Andrea Sacchi. In 1648 he assisted Cortona in the decoration of the Palazzo Pamphili in Rome. He developed a classical style befitting the grand manner style developing in Rome. Among other works in Rome, he painted a San Pio for the church of San Silvestro al Quirinale, a Martyrdom canvas for the church of Santa Maria a Campo Santo. In Perugia, for the Benedictine church, he painted a St Benedict meets Totila, King of the Goths.F. Tolomei, page 171. He joined the Accademia di San Luca in 1650. He married the daughter of the painter Alessandro Turchi of Verona. He spent his last years back in Tuscany.

The RCCM works with the complementary therapy professions and CAM researchers to promote safe and effective integrative and personalised medicine, and to promote the development of high quality research and evidence in the UK into complementary and alternative medicine. As the burden of complex chronic disease increases more people are turning to alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) and need guidance in making their healthcare choices. CAM is used by at least a quarter of the population of the UK.Bishop FL, Lewith GT. Who Uses CAM? A Narrative Review of Demographic Characteristics and Health Factors Associated with CAM Use. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2008 Mar 13. downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2010/102626.pdfThomas K, Coleman P. Use of complementary or alternative medicine in a general population in Great Britain. Results from the National Omnibus survey. J Public Health (Oxf). 2004 Jun;26(2):152-7. The research evidence base is limited at present. The ever increasing cost of chronic disease will require government and society to make decisions on the cost-effectiveness of the available health care options. Such decisions are best informed by evidence and currently accepted standards of care. A greater evidence base for CAM should facilitate wider availability of access to safe and effective complementary therapies within the National Health Service and across the UK, in order to help in preventing disease and improvinghealth. The House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee in 2000 published a report on CAM which emphasised the need for improved regulation and increased research into CAM therapies.House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee. Sixth Report: Complementary and Alternative Medicine, The Stationery Office, 2000. While regulation of the main CAM professions has made considerable progress, a paucity of funding has limited the development of CAM research. History The RCCM was co-founded in 1983 by a medical doctor Dr Richard Tonkins MD FRCP and a lay businessman, Mr Harold Wicks. During the 1980s, the focus of RCCM activity was on encouraging and publishing research projects, and on the exploration of appropriate research methodologies. A scientific journal was established, Complementary Medical Research (). A University Fellowship to explore CAM was established in partnership with the Medical Research Council and the University of Glasgow.Reilly D, Taylor MA, Beattie NG, Campbell JH, McSharry C, Aitchison TC, Carter R, Stevenson RD. Is evidence for homoeopathy reproducible? Lancet. 1994 Dec10;344(8937):1601-6 A series of annual conferences on research methodology were organised. During the 1990s, the RCCM focus was on undergraduate medical education and the inclusion of a CAM module as a part of the curricula for medical education; Dr Catherine Zollman became Director of the RCCM’s Medical Education Service and established a register of GPs with an interest in CAM. An RCCM research project was undertaken on the use of CAM by women with breast cancer, commissioned by South Thames Regional Health Authority After 2000, the RCCM was commissioned to undertake and completed some very large projects in partnership with universities, including the CAMEOL project for the Department of Health to assess CAM interventions in NHS priority areas by detailed review and critical appraisal of published research Current activity The current activities of RCCM are directed towards supporting the CAM professions in research and evidence-based practice, through increasing engagement between the professional bodies, the regulators, and the research community. The CAM professions in the UK are evolving and maturating. Regulation is well developed, with statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic in place, and herbal medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine moving towards statutory regulation. Other therapies such as massage and naturopathy have established voluntary regulation under the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) and others are moving towards this goal. Doctoral and post-doctoral research within CAM has guidance on methodology from the MRC. Research capacity in terms of on-going PhD/ MPhil research activity in complementary medicine within UK universities is increasing. However, evidence on the safety and effectiveness of CAM remains much needed, and more remains to be done in terms of translation of research into clinical practice Funding from the government for research to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAM, similar to that in the USA where a research funding council NCCAM provides substantial research funding specifically for CAM research, would enable the evidence base for CAM to develop in the UK.

It was first published by Doubleday Canada in September 1998.Kiss of the Fur Queen review at Quill & Quire, September 1998. The novel's main characters are Champion and Ooneemeetoo Okimasis, two young Cree brothers from Eemanipiteepitat in northern Manitoba who are taken from their family and sent to a residential school. Their language is forbidden, their names are changed to Jeremiah and Gabriel, and the boys are sexually abused by priests. However, a wily trickster figure, the Fur Queen, watches over the boys as they fulfill their destiny to become artists. The novel, a fictionalized account of the real-life childhood of Highway and his brother René, was a nominee for the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award and the Books in Canada First Novel Award in 1998. Francophone Ontarian poet and academic Robert Dickson translated the novel into French.\\"Who’s Who: Robert Dickson\\". Sudbury Living, January 3, 2013. Released under the title Champion et Ooneemeetoo, the French edition was published by Prise de parole in 2004. The German edition Der Kuss der Pelzkönigin. Ein indianischer Lebensweg was translated by Thomas Bauer and published in 2001 by Frederking & Thaler, Munich. Plot summary Kiss of the Fur Queen begins with the champion dog- sled racer Abraham Okimasis and the story of his two sons, Champion and Ooneemeetoo Okimasis from Eemanipiteepitat, Manitoba. Both brothers are taken from their families and sent to a residential school where they are unable to speak their language, forced to cut their hair, and renamed to Jeremiah and Gabriel. In their residential school experience, both brothers are physically and sexually abused at the hands of the priests which leads to Jeremiah's celibacy and Gabriel's inability to form successful relationships. The residential school is also the time that Gabriel meets the Fur Queen or better known as the trickster who watches over them throughout their lives. When he returns from residential school, Jeremiah moves to Winnipeg to pursue his interests in music which acts as a coping strategy for his earlier abuse. He immerses himself fully in his musical pursuits which results in his further isolation and feelings of loneliness due to his lack of meaningful relationships and family connections. Gabriel decides to join his brother in Winnipeg to continue his passion for dance. He embraces his homosexuality at a time when it was not safe to do so publicly, and self-medicates with drugs and alcohol. He turns to prostitution and endures vivid flashbacks of the abuse he suffered at the hands of the priests. Both brothers have troubles reconciling their two identities and this leads them to reject their Native identity and embrace the dominant culture. Themes There are many themes at play in this novel. There is the theme of the trickster, an element found throughout native storytelling and fiction. In this case the trickster appears in the lives of both Abraham, who is the father of the boys, and Gabriel and Jeremiah. The trickster appears in times of great importance for the characters and is a playful figure, in contrast to the stern vengeful god that the boys are introduced to in school. Another theme found in this novel is the devastating effects of colonization on Indigenous people. Gabriel and Jeremiah are sent to residential school where they are forced to speak English, and their own Cree culture and language is demonized. Both boys are traumatized by their experiences at residential school and face issues regarding identity growing up. Reconciliation is also a strong theme found in this work. Both Gabriel and Jeremiah have to find their own way to heal from their traumatic experiences at residential school.

It is located on the Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis campus in downtown Indianapolis. It is the only dental school in Indiana.  Details  The school is located at the center of Indiana, and in the heart of Indianapolis. It is part of Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), one of eight campuses in the IU system and the premier urban campus of Indiana University. The IUPUI campus is situated just a few blocks from Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis. IUPUI shares its location on the near west side of the city with the Indiana University Medical Center. Many of the dental school's faculty members have established strong collaborative ties with physicians and other scientists in the medical center facilities, which are just across the street from the school. During the 2010-11 academic year, 693 students pursued seven types of degree and/or certificate programs in dental assisting, dental hygiene, dentistry, and graduate dentistry. In addition, three other IU campuses (in Gary, South Bend, and Fort Wayne) offer certificates and degrees in allied dental programs. Carol Anne Murdoch-Kinch has been Dean of the school since June 2019.  Alumni  The IU dental school has more than 11,000 living alumni. They are pursuing careers throughout the United States and in more than 30 other countries. The IU Alumni Association counts dentistry among its most supportive groups. IU grads have been named to prestigious leadership posts in organized dentistry and in dental education throughout the world. Alumna Carol I. Turner (DDS'75) was appointed chief of the US Navy Dental Corps in 2003, becoming the first woman to hold the Navy's top position in dentistry; Ronald Zentz (DDS'85) is senior director of the American Dental Association's Council on Scientific Affairs; and Stephen Ralls (M'81 Periodontics) is executive director of the American College of Dentists.  Cheating episode  In May 2007, the School of Dentistry disciplined 46 dental students for cheating.IU dental school disciplines 46 on cheating charges Indianapolis Star, May 7, 2007. (available in paid archive) The Indianapolis Star initially reported that nine students were dismissed, 16 were suspended for periods ranging from three to twenty-four months, and 21 received letters of reprimand. However, all of the dismissals were reversed and most of the suspensions decreased after the student appeals were finalized. The incident \\"involved the unauthorized acquisition, sharing and use of passwords to enter electronically locked image files meant only for examinations\\", according to a memo written by Dean Lawrence Goldblatt, which the Indianapolis Star obtained. Dr. Goldblatt's memorandum states that the scandal involved the school's second-year class, the dental class of 2009. The memorandum states that the investigation took approximately two months to complete. According to Dr. Goldblatt, all \\"[s]tudents receiving any of the sanctions... have the right to appeal the decision to the School of Dentistry Faculty Council Executive Committee... within five working days of their official notice of the sanction.\\" Twenty-three students challenged the disciplinary determinations made by the Faculty Council at its May 4, 2007, meeting. During the appeal process, the school reversed every dismissal. Hence, no students were dismissed as a result of the scandal. In the final sanctions imposed against the class: 24 students were suspended from three months to twenty-four months, and an additional 18 students received letters of reprimand.

The episode was written by Oliver Goldstick and produced by Miguel Arteta. Plot As the day begins, Betty frantically tries to keep Daniel focused on work, but as she makes phone calls to his home to ask when he was coming in, it appears that Daniel is more occupied with sleeping with women than with his job, as he has reverted to his old hard-partying ways. Betty also notices author Quincy Combs (Leslie Jordan) in Daniel's office, looking to dig up dirt about the Meade family, even after telling Betty about Fey Sommers' diaries. Betty tells Quincy that he is wasting his time but Quincy isn't buying Betty's threats. Betty is also distracted by Christina, who shows off an invitation to a new night club that was given to her by Wilhelmina. Christina became worried that Betty is too focused on Daniel, so she hopes that Betty will loosen up with the invitation. But as we're about to find out, old habits are hard to break. As Betty and Christina enter the club, Betty tries to loosen up but it's not working, even after a big guy (who claims to be from Cheboygan, Michigan) asks her to dance with him. However, Betty discovers Daniel at the same club she and Christina are at. She sees her boss and Becks partying and flirting with a young model, Petra, and her sister, Lena. After Betty sees this, she also thinks she sees Quincy, who called her for info on Daniel's whereabouts, only to discover that Quincy was never there after she tries to warn Daniel, even as to taking a microphone from the DJ booth. Daniel, upset over being embarrassed by Betty, blames her for controlling his life and causes Daniel to betray Betty in a big way as he chews her assistant out, saying that the only time Betty should be concerned with Daniel is at work. When Christina and Betty leave the club, as Betty questions Christina why she doesn't like taking compliments for her clothes shown at the MODE Fashion Show, Betty learns from Christina about her \\"deal\\" with Wilhelmina and how she got the invitation, which results in Betty ending her friendship with the only person she ever trusted at MODE. Meanwhile, things go from bad to worse when Quincy stalks the Meades. As the other Meades deal with this new-found obstacle, Alexis schemes to get her hands on the diaries. Not to be outdone, Wilhelmina also hunts for them, as Quincy claims that the last six months of her life that were detailed in another set have not been accounted for. When Quincy confront Alexis about a secret dungeon that Bradford and Fey went for their secret trysts, Alexis decides to seek it out by looking at a blueprint of the Meade Building after Quincy shows her the passage from the diary. Alexis learns that the diaries hold a key to Bradford's treatment of Alexis, but as Alexis tries to call her dad in an effort to extend an olive branch, Wilhelmina succeeds in winning over Bradford by seducing him with her feet and learning his secret fetish, thus outwitting her former ally; it appears that Wilhelmina gave Quincy pictures of Alexis (before and after) in exchange for information on how to turn Bradford on. When Wilhelmina sees Alexis' name on Bradford's answering machine, she put it on voice mail. As for Amanda, she's upset that Alexis would choose Nick over her, so she attempts to sway Alexis into hiring her. Alexis also asked Amanda about the dungeon that Bradford had kept hidden, but told her it doesn't exist. But as Amanda secretly visits \\"The Closet\\" to look for shoes, she accidentally opens a compartment that leads to the hideaway. Meanwhile, Ignacio feels the heat when Constance pressures him to make their relationship a romantic one despite his non-attraction to her, knowing that her demands stands in the way of him obtaining a green card so he can stay in the United States. So despite warnings by Hilda not to go, Ignacio believes it's the only way he can see the lawyer that Constance hired for him. When he arrives to Constance's apartment, he discovers that Constance tricked him; she never called the lawyer and used this evening to lure him into marrying him. Hours later, Hilda is visited by Ignacio's real caseworker, who happens to be a man! Hilda learns from him that Constance was fired two months earlier, prompting Hilda to go to Constance's place after she warns Ignacio. As she arrives and prepares to confront her, Ignacio tells Hilda that Constance isn't a bad person; she had her heart broken, so he decides not to turn her in and forgives her. Back at Daniel's apartment, Daniel is having sex with Petra. But Lena comes in to drop a bombshell as Daniel finds himself in major jeopardy as he discovers that Petra is actually 16 and her \\"sister\\" Lena is actually her mother, who extorts Daniel into putting her daughter on the cover of MODE. Daniel finds himself wondering what he should do to get himself out of this situation, but when he calls Betty at home, Betty, upset over Daniel's actions at the club towards her, tells Ignacio to give him a message: she just \\"punched out\\".

It was built by Mitsubishi to a design by Blackburn Aircraft of Britain and was operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Design and development In 1927, the Japanese company Mitsubishi commissioned the British aircraft manufacturer Blackburn Aircraft to design an aircraft, which would be built under licence by Mitsubishi if successful, to enter a competition held by the Imperial Japanese Navy for a carrier-based reconnaissance and torpedo bomber to replace its B1M. Blackburn developed a design, the Blackburn T.7B, which was an enlarged development of their Ripon, which was under development for Britain's Fleet Air Arm. The T.7B was a three- seat biplane of steel tube construction and with high aspect ratio wings fitted with Handley Page slats, powered by a 466 kW (625 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Lbr engine. The design was declared the winner of the competition, with a prototype (referred to as the 3MR4) being ordered from Blackburn. This first flew on 28 December 1929 at Blackburn's factory at Brough, Yorkshire, and was shipped to Japan in February 1930. Three development prototypes were built by Mitsubishi in Japan before the aircraft was adopted as the Navy Type 89-1 Model 1 Carrier Attack Plane or Mitsubishi B2M1. Operational history The B2M1 entered service with the Imperial Japanese Navy in March 1932, serving aboard the carriers , and . Modifications to improve maintainability resulted in the B2M2 or Navy Type 89-2 Carrier Attack Plane, which otherwise showed little improvement in performance over the B2M1. Production of both versions totalled 204 aircraft. B2Ms were extensively used for high- and low-level bombing attacks against China at the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1931. Despite this, it is not her most well-known work; that honor belongs to Dishonored Lady, a play she co-wrote with Edward Sheldon, which was adapted twice into film (first as Letty Lynton and later with its actual title). Barnes' alma mater, Bryn Mawr College, along with the characters of college presidents M. Carey Thomas and Marion Park figure prominently in this work. The story, beginning in the 1890s and continuing into the 1930s, chronicles the life of Jane Ward Carver from her teens to age fifty-four. This novel follows many of the same themes as Barnes' other works. Centering on the social manners of upper middle class society, her female protagonists are often traditionalists, struggling to uphold conventional morality in the face of changing social climates.

He was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. He began his musical career in Los Angeles in his teens and migrated around to wind up in New York City in time to take part in the folk music revival of the early 1960s. He is best remembered for his activity in the Greenwich Village area. He performed with Bob Dylan soon after Dylan's arrival in New York City, was a contributor to Broadside Magazine and recorded a number of albums for Folkways Records and other labels. Spoelstra was raised as a Quaker. His career was put on hold from 1963 to 1965, when he performed alternative service as a conscientious objector in Fresno, California. In the mid-1960s, he frequently performed at the Ash Grove in West Hollywood. It was here that he wrote most of his best songs, including an album of country songs used as the sound-track for the movie Electra Glide in Blue. In 1969, while living in Sonoma County, California, he formed the Frontier Constabulary with Mitch Greenhill and Mayne Smith. After Spoelstra left to resume his solo career in 1970, the band continued as the Frontier. Spoelstra later settled near Modesto, California, where he lived until his death. Withdrawing from the touring life to raise a family, Spoelstra and his wife Sheri embraced Christianity. In the mid-1970s he became a minister and used his musical talents as a means to preach his spiritual messages. In the late 1970s, he recorded and released two albums of Gospel music, Somehow I Always Knew and Comin' Back To Town. Retiring from music in the early 1980s, he worked for a number of years as a tour bus driver in Yosemite National Park. Throughout this period in his life, Spoelstra remained in touch with his music. In 2001, he recorded an album entitled, Out Of My Hands for the Origin Jazz Library label; the first record he'd made in 20 years. The album is a mix of new songs written for the album and some of his old favorites. In his later years he returned to the stage to perform on a limited scale. He would perform until the summer of 2006 when illness forced him to stop. Several of his albums recorded for Elektra Records, long out of print, have been reissued. Spoelstra died from complications of pancreatic cancer at his home in Pioneer, California on February 25, 2007.

The episode was co-written by Marco Pennette, Veronica Becker & Sarah Kucserka and directed by Tricia Brock. The episode's title references the United States' \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" military policy. Plot In the wake of Claire Meade's arrest, the Suarezes find themselves dealing with the press coverage. The episode opens with a news reporter seeking to get a comment from Betty who, while trying to get away from the news cameras, runs directly into the wall of a bus shelter. Justin amuses himself by watching the footage repeatedly, which distinctly annoys Betty, who later expresses her guilt over Claire's arrest to Hilda. At MODE, the now released Bradford and Alexis finally face off, with Bradford firing his daughter. Later on, Bradford goes to see Claire to see how she is doing. Claire insists that she has been better while he tells her that he is here for her. Daniel later comes in and Claire informs them that she wants them to be a family again, including Alexis. Bradford is extremely uncomfortable with the idea until Claire tells her husband that he can't fire Alexis, since he does not own MODE. She reminds him that while he is the owner of Meade Publications, she owns the rights to MODE and therefore Alexis stays. Meanwhile, Marc's mother -- to whom he has never disclosed his homosexuality -- visits the office; she brings along her cat, Lady Buttons of Camelot. Amanda learns that after three years of willingly pretending to be Marc's girlfriend during such visits, she has been \\"dumped\\" in absentia because Marc wanted to escape his mother's pressure to move on to marriage. Amanda gets angry and storms off, yelling to Marc that she will be the best 'pretend girlfriend' he has ever had. Hours later, Betty tells Daniel that it may be a good thing that he and Alexis work side by side, but Daniel informs her that it was never easy working directly beside Alex, because he always had to come out on top. Daniel and Alexis later meet with Wilhelmina to inform her that they are both Editors-in-Chief at MODE and inform Wilhelmina that she is still the creative director. When he begins to claim what duties he will handle, Alexis interrupts and insists that she does not want anything to do with the business. After Daniel leaves the room, Wilhelmina rushes over to Alexis and tells her that she has to take what belongs to her and that she cannot leave MODE, then volunteers her office. Marc then panics when Wilhelmina drags him down to their new office and tells him it is only temporary--just long enough for Alexis and Daniel to push each other out. Marc gets a text message on his cell phone informing him that his mother is in the building. Marc's mother, Jean, stops at the desk to see Amanda and tells her that she cannot believe how she broke her little boy's heart with all of her drug and sex addictions. An incensed Amanda then notices Betty walking down the hall, pulls her over to the desk and vengefully tells Jean that Betty is Marc's new girlfriend. Betty laughs, but before she is able to mention that Marc is gay, Marc cuts Betty off in mid-sentence by kissing her on the lips (with Amanda in the background pretending to vomit). Marc then rushes to the bathroom and washes out his mouth in disgust. Betty is stunned by Marc's deceit, but when he begs her to help him, she agrees to play along. Back at the desk Amanda notices Betty's cell phone is ringing, and when she sees it is Ignacio on the phone, Amanda cruelly tells Mrs. Wiener that she should answer and initiate a chat about Betty and Marc's relationship. Moments later Amanda joyfully rushes over to tell Marc and Betty the news that they have dinner plans with Betty's family. Marc then tells Betty that if she helps him, he will tell her important information that will help save Daniel's job. Betty later rushes to see Daniel and tells him Alexis is planning to take over the company and push him out, prompting Daniel to go see Alexis, who then tells him they should try working together. Daniel insists he is not just her kid brother anymore and she cannot push him around, but Alexis tells him they are in this 50/50. So Daniel agrees and instructs her to have her \\"letter from the editor\\" ready by noon tomorrow, so they can print them side by side. When he leaves, she calls in her new assistant, Nick, and orders him to cancel his plans for tonight because they have to get their work completed by midnight, informing him Daniel is crazy if he thinks she is going to share anything with him. Alexis has a major photo shoot and sends her pictures in to be on the next cover of MODE. Wilhelmina is pleased with this scheme, saying this is too easy. Alexis tells them Daniel is not going to know what hit him and rushes out the door. In another corner of the building, Marc and Betty are working hard at memorizing personal information about each other, until Betty gets distracted by Henry, who comes over to drop off the mail. After Henry mumbles the answers to the personal questions concerning Betty -- all of which Marc had failed -- Henry leaves. Betty goes to see Daniel and tells him his \\"letter from the editor\\" needs to be his own statement about the Meade family instead of about shoes, then rushes home to fix dinner. Marc, Jean and Buttons the cat -- demoted from royalty after finishing poorly in a show that afternoon -- arrive at the Suarez household for dinner. Hilda jokingly insists to Marc that she \\"wouldn’t have missed this evening for the world.\\" As everyone struggles to make conversation during the dinner, Betty focuses the conversation on Jean and her cats. Jean then brings up Marc's old roommate and friend, Chuck; while Jean is shown to be oblivious to clues that Chuck had actually been Marc's boyfriend, Marc quickly insists that they were not that close. Hilda and Ignacio make numerous comments hinting to homosexuality and giggle at the situation. Things get a little too intense and Betty excuses them to her room, informing Marc that he is a grown man and needs to tell his mother the truth. Marc insists that if tells her the truth now it will ruin things, but Betty assures him that it is the right thing to do, and that it will make their relationship better. Justin arrives and complains to everyone that his father took him out for fast food when he is trying his best to watch points for swim suit season, before showing off his \\"Free Claire Meade\\" T-shirt, saying that he will not rest until Claire is free. When Buttons notices the door open and runs out, Ignacio runs after her and sets the alarm off on his ankle tag. Jean sits in shock at all that is going on around her. The doorbell then rings and Daniel enters the room, and when Jean asks who he is, Justin tells her that Daniel is Betty's ex-boyfriend. Around the same time, Wilhelmina goes to see Claire in the hospital and tells her she is worried about the business because Daniel and Alexis are going to kill each other. She suggests she get her attorney to draw up a power of attorney so she can keep things running smoothly. But Claire informs Wilhelmina that only a Meade will run the company from now on. Wilhelmina then holds a bottle of liquor in front of Claire's face, which Claire stoically resists. Wilhelmina puts a glass of liquor right on the table in front of Claire, who is handcuffed to the bed. When she leaves, Claire tries to reach it, but fails. Daniel has come to see Betty at her home to tell her he has finished the editor's letter and wants her to proof it, to see her look at him with pride. She informs him that she is proud of him and that she will submit it in time for the printers. After Daniel leaves, Marc walks in to see what is keeping Betty so long, then informs her that she need not worry about the letter since Alexis has already sent the issue to print. In shock, Betty tells Marc she must notify Daniel immediately. She slams the door leaving Marc all alone there with his mother and her family. Betty catches up to Daniel and they rush off to stop the press. As Marc and Jean gather their things to leave Betty's house, he informs her he is breaking up with Betty. She is thrilled to hear this and starts criticizing all the Suarez family until Justin runs by, saying in a sing-song voice \\"Golden Girls marathon.\\" Jean tells Marc she does not even know what \\"that\\" is, that Justin is so \\"swishy.\\" Marc becomes furious and tells his mother to shut up. This momentarily silences her, and Marc informs her that these people have done a really nice thing for him tonight and informs her that she is practically calling her own son \\"swishy\\" when she talks that way about Justin. She warns him not to say any more but Marc tells her to open her eyes and see him for what he really is. Jean says she'd better leave, but Marc blocks the door, saying he may never be this brave again. He tells her that he loves her, but if she wants to get to know the real him, she'll have to get to know him as he is. Jean looks at her son and tells him that if this is the lifestyle he has chosen, and if this is the real him, then she does not want to know him. She opens the door and leaves the Suarez house and sarcastically instructs him to thank them for a \\"lovely\\" evening. Alexis sees Daniel and Betty running down the street to the printers and as they sprint side by side toward the entrance, Alexis wins in the end. Daniel later runs into Betty at a bar and tells her that if Alexis wants the company, then she can have it and he will be only too glad to return to his old lifestyle of partying and unemployment. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina sits in her office and thinks of a plan, so she reaches down and scratches out her own last name on her stationery and writes Meade in its place, then dolls up and heads over to see Bradford, where she offers him a little dinner and some company. Betty arrives back home and finds Marc sitting alone on her front porch. He tells her that his mother left when he told her the truth. Betty tells him she has learned that it is not always family that loves you the most, but that sometimes it is the family we make for ourselves. Marc tells her fondly that she will always be his \\"Little Chimichanga\\" and then leaves to go home while Betty sits alone to read the letter that Daniel wrote, in which he talks about how happy he is to have Alexis back with him and that his family is finally coming together. Betty then goes inside and spends time with her family. Production Marc and his mother have different last names. In Fake Plastic Snow we learned that Marc's last name is St. James, but in this episode his mother's last name was Weiner, which means that this is also Marc's real last name. However that reason behind Marc's last name being changed was edited out when \\"Don't Ask\\" aired. In the deleted scene, Betty asks Marc: \\"Your real (last) name is Weiner?\\" Marc answers: \\"I had to change it. A gay kid named Weiner? I wanted to beat myself up.\\" The idea for Marc to come out to his mother was both actor Michael Urie (Marc St. James) and America Ferrera's idea.From E! online (May 1, 2007) In a bonus feature from the season one DVD, the scene where Betty bumps into a bus shelter is actually a green screen with the outside setting digitized. Ashley Jensen (Christina) does not appear in this episode. Also, this episode introduces Max Greenfield to the cast as Nick Pepper. This episode makes references to properties with connections to The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries: Golden Girls, Cinderella (which Henry claims is Betty's favorite character and movie), Mulan, She's All That and High School Musical (which is Marc's favorite musical). Awards \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" was submitted for consideration in the category of \\"Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series\\" for the 2007 Emmy Awards. In addition, Vanessa L. Williams submitted this episode for consideration in the category of \\"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\\" on her behalf. Mark Indelicato and Michael Urie also chose this episode respectively to submit for consideration of their work in the category of \\"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series,\\" while Patti Lupone submitted this episode as her entry in the category of \\"Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series\\". Music notes The song \\"Boys Wanna Be Her\\" by Peaches is played during Alexis's photo shoot.http://www.tvshowmusic.com/shows/uglybetty/season01.html Retrieved 2010-05-08. The song heard at the end of this episode is \\"Orange Sky\\" by Alexi Murdoch. Reception The episode was well-received because of Michael Urie's character. Notes Entertainment Weekly's Tanner Stransky: \\"Looks like my Betty wish came true. In my TV Watch last week, I pined for more focus on the supporting characters, and — voila! — an episode centered on Marc, his sexuality, and how he has not come out to his in-your-face, overbearing mother. Plus, some nice support from Amanda. And a bit from his girlfriend Betty, too. Simply awesome. And we were treated to Claire in the hospital, Willy hatching more ways to take over Mode (including an attempt to seduce Bradford!), and some always awkward conversation between Henry and Betty. Double awesome. All around, another great episode.\\"From EW.com References Also starring *Judith Light (Claire Meade) *Christopher Gorham (Henry) *Max Greenfield (Nick Pepper) Guest stars *Patti LuPone (Mrs. Jean Weiner) *John Burke (Reporter) Category:Ugly Betty (season 1) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ","title":"Don't Ask, Don't Tell (Ugly Betty)"},{"id":"9801461","text":"McArthur River Mine Airport is an airport south of the McArthur River Mine townsite, Northern Territory, Australia.

In biological research, repressilators have been used to build cellular models and understand cell function. There are both artificial and naturally-occurring repressilators. Recently, the naturally-occurring repressilator clock gene circuit in Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) and mammalian systems have been studied.  Artificial Repressilators  Artificial repressilators were first engineered by Michael Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in 2000, complementing other research projects studying simple systems of cell components and function. In order to understand and model the design and cellular mechanisms that confers a cell’s function, Elowitz and Leibler created an artificial network consisting of a loop with three transcriptional repressors. This network was designed from scratch to exhibit a stable oscillation that acts like an electrical oscillator system with fixed time periods. The network was implemented in Escherichia coli (E. coli) via recombinant DNA transfer. It was then verified that the engineered colonies did indeed exhibit the desired oscillatory behavior. The repressilator consists of three genes connected in a feedback loop, such that each gene represses the next gene in the loop and is repressed by the previous gene. In the synthetic insertion into E. Coli, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a reporter so that the behavior of the network could be observed using fluorescence microscopy. The repressilator genetic regulatory network, in which each protein translated by a gene represses the next in the cycle. The design of the repressilator was guided by biological and circuit principles with discrete and stochastic models of analysis. Six differential equations were used to model the kinetics of the repressilator system based on protein and mRNA concentrations, as well as appropriate parameter and Hill coefficient values. In the study, Elowitz and Leibler generated figures showing oscillations of repressor proteins, using integration and typical parameter values as well as a stochastic version of the repressilator model using similar parameters. These models were analyzed to determine the values of various rates that would yield a sustained oscillation. It was found that these oscillations were favored by promoters coupled to efficient ribosome binding sites, cooperative transcriptional repressors, and comparable protein and mRNA decay rates. This analysis motivated two design features which were engineered into the genes. First, promoter regions were replaced with a more efficient hybrid promoter which combined the E. coli phage lambda PL (λ PL) promoter with lac repressor (Lacl) and Tet repressor (TetR) operator sequences. Second, to reduce the disparity between the lifetimes of the repressor proteins and the mRNAs, a carboxy terminal tag based on the ssrA-RNA sequence was added at the 3' end of each repressor gene. This tag is recognized by proteases which target the protein for degradation. The design was implemented using a low-copy plasmid encoding the repressilator and a higher-copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of E. coli.  Naturally-Occurring Repressilators  = Plants = Circadian circuits in plants feature a transcriptional regulatory feedback loop called the repressilator. In the core oscillator loop (outlined in gray) in A. thaliana, light is first sensed by two cryptochromes and five phytochromes. Two transcription factors, Circadian Clock Associated 1 (CCA1) and Late Elongated Hypocotyl (LHY), repress genes associated with evening expression like Timing of CAB expression 1 (TOC1) and activate genes associated with morning expression by binding to their promoters. TOC1, an evening gene, positively regulates CCA1 and LHY via an unknown mechanism. Evening-phased transcription factor CCA1 Hiking Expedition (CHE) and histone demethylase jumonji C domain-containing 5 (JMJD5) directly repress CCA1. Other components have been found to be expressed throughout the day and either directly or indirectly inhibit or activate a consequent element in the circadian circuit, thereby creating a complex, robust and flexible network of feedback loops.  Morning-Phase Expression  The morning-phase expression loop refers to the genes and proteins that regulate rhythms during the day in A. thaliana. The two main genes are LHY and CCA1, which encode LHY and CCA1 transcription factors. These proteins form heterodimers that enter the nucleus and bind to the TOC1 gene promoter, repressing the production of TOC1 protein. When TOC1 protein is expressed, it serves to regulate LHY and CCA1 by inhibition of their transcription. This was later supported in 2012 by Dr. Alexandra Pokhilo, who used computational analyses to show that TOC1 served this role as an inhibitor of LHY and CCA1 expression. The morning loop serves to inhibit hypocotyl elongation, in contrast with the evening-phase loop which promotes hypocotyl elongation. The morning phase loop has shown to be incapable of supporting circadian oscillation when evening-phase expression genes have been mutated, suggesting the interdependency of each component in this naturally-occurring repressilator.  Evening-Phase Expression  Early Flowering 3 (ELF3), Early Flowering 4 (ELF4) and Phytoclock1 (LUX) are the key elements in evening-phased clock gene expression in A. thaliana. They form the evening complex, in which LUX binds to the promoters of Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 (PIF4) and Phytochrome Interacting Factor 5 (PIF5) and inhibits them. As a result, hypocotyl elongation is repressed in the early- evening. When the inhibition is alleviated late at night, the hypocotyl elongates. Photoperiod flowering is controlled by output gene Gigantea (GI). GI is activated at night and activates the expression of Constans (CO), which activates the expression of Flowering Locus T (FT). FT then causes flowering in long-days. = Mammals = Mammals evolved an endogenous timing mechanism to coordinate both physiology and behavior to the 24 hour period. In 2016, researchers identified a sequence of three subsequent inhibitions within this mechanism that they identified as a repressilator, which is now believed to serve as a major core element of this circadian network. The necessity of this system was established through a series of gene knockouts amongst cryptochrome (Cry), period (Per), and Rev-erb -- core mammalian clock genes whose knockouts lead to arrhythmicity. The model that these researchers generated includes Bmal1 as a driver of E-box mediated transcription, Per2 and Cry1 as early and late E-box repressors, respectively, as well as the D-box regulator Dbp and the nuclear receptor Rev-erb-α. The sequential inhibitions by Rev-erb, Per and Cry1 can generate sustained oscillations, and by clamping all other components except for this repressilator oscillations persisted with similar amplitudes and periods. All oscillating networks seem to involve any combination of these three core genes, as demonstrated in various schematics released by researchers.  Recent Work  The repressilator model has been used to model and study other biological pathways and systems. Since, extensive work into the repressilator’s modeling capacities has been performed. In 2003, the repressilator’s representation and validaton of biological models, being a model with many variables, was performed using the Simpathica system, which verified that the model does indeed oscillate with all of its complexities. As stated in Elowitz and Leibler’s original work, the ultimate goal for repressilator research is to build an artificial circadian clock that mirrors its natural, endogenous counterpart. This would involve developing an artificial clock with reduced noise and temperature compensation in order to better understand circadian rhythms that can be found in every domain of life.A Synthetic Oscillatory Network of Transcriptional Regulators; Michael Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler; Nature. 2000 Jan 20;403(6767):335-8. Disruption of circadian rhythms may lead to loss of rhythmicity in metabolic and transcriptional processes, and even quicken the onset of certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In 2017, oscillators that generated circadian rhythms and were not influenced much by temperature were created in a laboratory. Pathologically, the repressilator model can be used to model cell growth and abnormalities that may arise, such as those present in cancer cells. In doing so, new treatments may be developed based on circadian activity of cancerous cells. Additionally, in 2016, a research team improved upon the previous design of the repressilator. Following noise (signal processing) analysis, the authors moved the GFP reporter construct onto the repressilator plasmid and removed the ssrA degradation tags from each repressor protein. This extended the period and improved the regularity of the oscillations of the repressilator. In 2019, a study furthered Elowitz and Leibler's model by improving the repressilator system by achieving a model with a unique steady state and new rate function. This experiment expanded the current knowledge of repression and gene regulation.  Significance  = Synthetic Biology = Artificial repressilators were discovered by implanting a synthetic inhibition loop into E. coli. This represented the first implementation of synthetic oscillations into an organism. Further implications of this include the possibility of rescuing mutated components of oscillations synthetically in model organisms. The artificial repressilator is a milestone of synthetic biology which shows that genetic regulatory networks can be designed and implemented to perform novel functions. However, it was found that the cells' oscillations drifted out of phase after a period of time and the artificial repressilator's activity was influenced by cell growth. The initial experiment therefore gave new appreciation to the circadian clock found in many organisms, as endogenous repressilators are significantly more robust than implanted artificial repressilators. New investigations at the RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center have found that chemical modifications to a single protein molecule could form a temperature independent, self-sustainable oscillator . Artificial repressilators could potentially aid research and treatments in fields ranging from circadian biology to endocrinology. They are increasingly able to demonstrate the synchronization inherent to natural biological systems and the factors that affect them. = Circadian Biology = A better understanding of the naturally-occurring repressilator in model organisms with endogenous, circadian timings, like A. thaliana, has applications in agriculture, especially in regards to plant rearing and livestock management.

He also went by the name Alessandro Veronese or the nickname L'Orbetto. His style has been described as soft and Caravaggesque at the same time. Biography Diana and Actaeon Turchi initially trained with Felice Riccio (il Brusasorci) in Verona. By 1603, he was working as independent painter, and in 1606–1609, Turchi painted the organ shutters for the Accademia Filarmonica of Verona. When Brusasorci died in 1605, Turchi and his fellow painter Pasquale Ottino completed a series of their deceased master's canvases. In 1610, he completed an Assumption altarpiece for the church of San Luca of Verona. In 1612, the Veronese Guild of the Goldsmiths commissioned from Turchi an altarpiece, today lost, of the Madonna and Saints. On leaving the school of Riccio, he went to Venice, where he worked for a time under Carlo Cagliari. By 1616, Turchi traveled to Rome and participated in the fresco decoration depicting the Gathering of Manna for the Sala Reggia of the Quirinal Palace, and painting a Christ, Magdalen, and Angels for cardinal Scipione Borghese.now in Galleria Borghese In competition with Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona, he painted some pictures in the church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini. In 1619, he sent an altarpiece of the 40 martyrs for the Chapel of the Innocents in the church of Santo Stefano, Verona, to hang next to paintings by Pasquale Ottino and Marcantonio Bassetti. He also painted a Flight into Egypt for the church of San Romualdo, Rome; a Holy Family for San Lorenzo in Lucina; and a San Carlo Borromeo in San Salvatore in Lauro. He was much employed on cabinet pictures, representing historical subjects, which he frequently painted on black marble. Among his pupils, Giovanni Ceschini and Giovanni Battista Rossi (il Gobbino), practiced in Verona, the former painting copies of his master's works, which were often taken for originals. David with the Head of Goliath For the Count Giangiacomo Giusti, in 1620 he paints an Allegory of Fame between Mercury and Pallas Athena and three canvases of Faith, Hope, and Charity. In 1621 executes for French cardinal François de Sourdis the Resurrection of Christ, now in the cathedral of Sant'Andrea of Bordeaux, and sends the Adoration of the Magi for the Gherardini family in Verona. By 1621, he had completed a painting of San Carlo Borromeo and the Madonna in Glory for San Salvatore in Lauro in Rome. Documents from 1629, indicate Turchi was paid 110 scudi for painting St. Anthony of Padua for the Farnese Palace at Caprarola. In 1632, an inventory of the Palazzo Mattei di Giove, records a Saint Marta and Maria Madalena and a Samaritan Women by Turchi His sister married Giacinto Gimignani. In 1623, Turchi married Lucia San Giuliano. In 1637, with the sponsorship of the cardinal Francesco Barberini, he became Principe or director of the Accademia di San Luca. In 1638, he joined the papal guild of artists, called the Pontifical Academy of Fine Arts and Letters of the Virtuosi al Pantheon. He died in Rome.

Continuing its exploration of the transformation of the American South from its traditional agrarian society to a new economic and social order, The Store follows the return from war of Miltiades Vaiden. The novel depicts how wealthy whites, yeomen farmer whites, and African American slaves attempt to adapt to life in the post-War South. Plot summary Colonel Miltiades Vaiden, a decorated Civil War Confederate officer, former overseer of Crowninshield plantation and head of local KKK chapter, personal and economic trials and tribulations during the Reconstruction period. The title, \\"The Store\\", is symbolic of Col. Milt's ethical and economic transition from post war poverty to economic independence, set against the \\"old plantation\\" culture. The novel describes in blunt language, the cultural stress the old plantation society and former slaves have in adjusting to the post war reconstruction.

He was the person who captured Nian, the great beast that terrorised the people of China every Chinese New Year. Every Chinese New Year was a time of suffering and fear for the people of China because of Nian, the great beast. One Chinese New Year's Eve, the monk, Hongjun Laozu, came to a village in China. He saw how everyone looked sad and frightened, so he went to a young man and said \\"Why are you so sad? It is Chinese New Year, a time for celebration.\\" The man replied \\"Do you not know? Have you not heard about Nian? He comes every New Year and terrorises us, even eats us.\\" The monk said \\"I will go and reason with Nian.\\" So off he went, to find Nian. When Hongjun Laozu came to Nian, he said \\"Nian, I have come to reason with you. Stop eating and terrorising the people of China.\\" But Nian Said \\"Haha. You have delivered yourself to me, old man, so now I will eat you.\\" The man replied, \\"Oh, but what will that prove? Eating me isn't great! Would you dare to eat the poisonous snakes on the mountains?\\" \\"Bah! What's so difficult about that?\\" So Nian went to the poisonous snakes and ate them up. \\"How is this? Am I not great?\\" \\"At the back of the mountain there are many great beasts. Can you subdue them?\\" So Nian went and scared all of the dangerous beasts out of the back of the mountain. \\"Old man, now its time for me to eat you!\\" \\"Sure, but just wait while I take my clothes off, I will taste much better then\\". So the old man took his clothes off to reveal his undergarments, which were red. \\"OK, you can eat me now.\\" But Nian said \\"Ah! a red undergarment! I dearly hate red, get out of my sight quickly.\\" \\"Haha! I knew you were afraid of red!\\" The old man went into the town on top of Nian and said \\"Dear villagers, do not be afraid. Nian is most terrified of red. From now on each house must paste red on each of their doors to prevent Nian creating havoc.\\" After that, the people started to paste red paper on their front doors before New Year's Day. After that incident Nian never came to the village again.Hongjun Laozu eventually captured Nian and after that, Nian retreated to a nearby mountain.

Formed in 1988 by theatre director and librettist Douglas Horton, it is Australia's only full-time company exclusively devoted to the commissioning and presentation of contemporary chamber opera by living artists. After taking up the artistic directorship in 2010, David Young commissioned and presented twelve new Australian operas, many of which were created as part of the company's \\"Living Room Opera\\" series. In 2013, Tim Stitz was appointed as Creative Director, leading a new company model consisting of four Artistic Associates. In 2017, the company restructured again and Tamara Saulwick was appointed Artistic Director.http://chambermade.org/people/tamara-saulwick/ Chamber Made Opera works with established artists and emerging professionals.

The company quickly established itself as a force in the Australian arts industry, presenting many acclaimed works (see below for list of productions), winning awards, and touring nationally and internationally. Horton was the librettist for many of the company’s works; he stepped down as Artistic Director in March 2009, after 21 years. In 2010 composer David Young was appointed the role of Artistic Director, a position he held until December 2013. Young lead the company through a period of rejuvenation and transformation, pioneering the innovative Living Room Opera series (see below). In early 2013 CMO announced a new company structure would be installed following the departure of David Young, headed by new Creative Director Tim Stitz, who appointed a team of four Artistic Associates to join him in the next phase of the company's life.

The Treaty of Almizra (or Treaty of Almiçra) was the third of a series of three treaties between the Crown of Aragon and Crown of Castile meant to determine the limits of their expansion into Andalusia so as to prevent squabbling between the Christian princes. Specifically, it defined the borders of the Kingdom of Valencia. James I of Aragon signed it on 26 March 1244, but Alfonso X of Castile did not affirm it until much later. According to the treaty, all lands south of a line from Biar to Villajoyosa through Busot were reserved for Castile. The treaty succeeded those of Tudilén and Cazorla, which were constantly breached. The clause by which neither party seemed capable of residing was that neither crown should diminish the partition assigned to the other or put any obstacle in the way of the other attaining unto his portion. That clause was broken when James I conquered Caudete, Villena, and Sax, which technically belonged to Castile. At the same time, the infante Alfonso was holding Xàtiva in the zone assigned to Aragon. The treaty first received mention in the second chapter of Llibre dels fets. The text of the treaty itself, however, was finally published in 1905. The treaty was signed in Campo de Mirra, where a monument, erected in 1977, still remembers it. In 1296, during a break in the war between the two crowns, James II of Aragon conquered the Kingdom of Murcia. The kingdom was divided and Medio Vinalopó, Bajo Vinalopó, L'Alacantí, and Vega Baja del Segura were incorporated into Valencia by the treaties of Torrellas (1304) and Elche (1305).

In different parts of the world, a market place may be described as a souk (from the Arabic), bazaar (from the Persian), a fixed mercado (Spanish), or itinerant tianguis (Mexico), or palengke (Philippines). Some markets operate daily and are said to be permanent markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be periodic markets. The form that a market adopts depends on its locality's population, culture, ambient and geographic conditions. The term market covers many types of trading, as market squares, market halls and food halls, and their different varieties. Due to this, marketplaces can be situated both outdoors and indoors. Markets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3,000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar. Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun. In Europe, informal, unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal, chartered markets from the 12th century. Throughout the Medieval period, increased regulation of marketplace practices, especially weights and measures, gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices. Around the globe, markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions, especially weather, tradition and culture. In the Middle East, markets tend to be covered, to protect traders and shoppers from the sun. In milder climates, markets are often open air. In Asia, a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in non-perishables is common. Today, markets can also be accessed electronically or on the internet through e-commerce platforms. In many countries, shopping at a local market is a standard feature of daily life. Given the market's role in ensuring food supply for a population, markets are often highly regulated by a central authority. In many places, designated market places have become listed sites of historic and architectural significance and represent part of a town or nation's cultural assets. For these reasons, they are often popular tourist destinations. Etymology The term market comes from the Latin mercatus (\\"market place\\"). The earliest recorded use of the term market in English is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 963, a work that was created during the reign of Alfred the Great (r. 871-899) and subsequently distributed, copied throughout English monasteries. The exact phrase was “Ic wille þæt markete beo in þe selue tun,” which roughly translates as “I want to be at that market in the good town.” History The Bazaar of Athens by Edward Dodwell, 1821 =In prehistory= Markets have existed since ancient times.Bintliff, J., \\"Going to Market in Antiquity,\\" In Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums, Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, pp 209-250 Some historians have argued that a type of market has existed since humans first began to engage in trade.Twede, D., \\"Commercial amphoras: The earliest consumer packages?\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2002, pp 98–108Wengrow, D., \\"Prehistories of Commodity Branding,\\" Current Anthropology,Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34 Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenecia, Greece, Egypt and on the Arabian peninsula. However, not all societies developed a system of markets.Paquet-Byrne, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, 2003, pp 13-14 The Greek historian, Herodotus noted that markets did not evolve in ancient Persia. Across the Mediterranean and Aegean, a network of markets emerged from the early Bronze Age. A vast array of goods were traded including: salt, lapiz-lazuli, dyes, cloth, metals, pots, ceramics, statues, spears and other implements. Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age traders segmented trade routes according to geographical circuits.Alberti, M.

Bazaar and its Role in the Development of Iranian Traditional Cities [Working Paper], Tabriz Azad University, Iran, 2006 The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth.Thamis, \\"Herodotus on the Egyptians.\\" Ancient History Encyclopedia. Ancient History Encyclopedia, 18 Jan 2012. Web. 20 Aug 2017. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.Herodotus: The History of Herodotus, Book I (The Babylonians), c. 440BC, translated by G.C. Macaulay, c. 1890 =In antiquity= Ruins of the macellum (market-place) at Leptis Magna, Carthage In antiquity, markets were typically situated in the town's centre. The market was surrounded by alleyways inhabited by skilled artisans, such as metal-workers, leather workers and carpenters. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days. Across ancient Greece market places (agorai) were to be found in most city states, where they operated within the agora (open space). Between 550 and 350 BCE, Greek stallholders clustered together according to the type of goods carried - fish- sellers were in one place, clothing in another and sellers of more expensive goods such as perfumes, bottles and jars were located in a separate building.McMillan, J., Reinventing the Bazaar: A Natural History of Markets, N.Y., Norton, 2002, p. 5 The Greeks organised trade into separate zones, all located near the city centre and known as stoa. A freestanding colonnade with a covered walkway, the stoa was both a place of commerce and a public promenade, situated within or adjacent to the agora.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 p. 4 At the market-place (agorai) in Athens, officials were employed by the government to oversee weights, measures, and coinage to ensure that the people were not cheated in market place transactions. The rocky and mountainous terrain in Greece made it difficult for producers to transport goods or surpluses to local markets, giving rise to the kapēlos,. a specialised type of retailer who operated as an intermediary purchasing produce from farmers and transporting it over short distances to the city markets. In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. Trajan's Market at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE, was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront.Coleman, P., Shopping Environments, Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28 In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace. In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Market stall holders were primarily local primary producers who sold small surpluses from their individual farming activities and also artisans who sold leather-goods, metal-ware and pottery. Consumers were made up of several different groups; farmers who purchased minor farm equipment and a few luxuries for their homes and urban dwellers who purchased basic necessities. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved importing and exporting. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies.Bintliff, J., \\"Going to Market in Antiquity,\\" In Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums, Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229 Trajan's Market, Rome, Italy At Pompeii multiple markets served the population of approximately 12,000. Produce markets were located in the vicinity of the Forum, while livestock markets were situated on the city's perimeter, near the amphitheatre. A long narrow building at the north-west corner of the Forum was some type of market, possibly a cereal market. On the opposite corner stood the macellum, thought to have been a meat and fish market. Market stall-holders paid a market tax for the right to trade on market days. Some archaeological evidence suggests that markets and street vendors were controlled by local government. A graffito on the outside of a large shop documents a seven-day cycle of markets; \\"Saturn’s day at Pompeii and Nuceria, Sun’s day at Atella and Nola, Moon’s day at Cumae ... etc.\\" The presence of an official commercial calendar suggests something of the market's importance to community life and trade.Beard, M., The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found, Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, \\"Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker\\" Markets were also important centres of social life.Millar, F., \\"The World of the Golden Ass,\\" Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 71, 1981, pp. 63-7 =In medieval Europe= Medieval market scene by Joachim Beuckelaer, c. 1560 In early Western Europe, markets developed close to monasteries, castles or royal residences. Priories and aristocratic manorial households created considerable demand for goods and services - both luxuries and necessities and also afforded some protection to merchants and traders. These centres of trade attracted sellers which would stimulate the growth of the town. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists 50 markets in England, however, many historians believe this figure underestimates the actual number of markets in operation at the time. In England, some 2,000 new markets were established between 1200 and 1349. By 1516, England had some 2,464 markets and 2,767 fairs while Wales had 138 markets and 166 fairs. From the 12th century, English monarchs awarded a charter to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter protected the town's trading privileges in return for an annual fee. Once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days.Dyer, C., Everyday Life in Medieval England, London, Hambledon and London, 1994, pp 283-303 Fairs, which were usually held annually, and almost always associated with a religious festival, traded in high value goods, while regular weekly or bi-weekly markets primarily traded in fresh produce and necessities.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\\" Business History Review, Vol 85, Spring, 2011, pp 9–37. doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018 Although a fair's primary purpose was trade, it typically included some elements of entertainment, such as dance, music or tournaments. As the number of markets increased, market towns situated themselves sufficiently far apart so as to avoid competition, but close enough to permit local producers a round trip within one day (about 10 km).Nicholas, D.M., The Growth of the Medieval City: From Late Antiquity to the Early Fourteenth Century, Oxon, Routledge, 2014, p. 182 Some British open-air markets have been operating continuously since the 12th century. Loggia del Pesce, Florence, (formerly part of the Loggia del Mercato Vecchio) just prior to its demolition in 1880 A pattern of market trading using mobile stalls under covered arcades was probably established in Italy with the open loggias of Mercato Nuovo (1547) designed and constructed by Giovanni Battista del Tasso (and funded by the Medici family); Mercato Vecchio, Florence designed by Giorgio Vasari (1567) and Loggia del Grano (1619) by architect, Giulio Parigi.Pevsner, N., A History of Building Types, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 235; Goy, R.J., Florence: A Walking Guide to Its Architecture, Yale University Press, 2015; Codini, E.K. (ed), Architettura a Pisa nel Primo Periodo Mediceo, Gangemi, 2003, p.213 Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Over time, permanent shops began opening daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets, while peddlers or itinerant sellers continued to fill in any gaps in distribution. During the Middle Ages, the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange. Shops had higher overhead costs, but were able to offer regular trading hours and a relationship with customers and may have offered added value services, such as credit terms to reliable customers. The economy was primarily characterised by local trading in which goods were traded across relatively short distances. Beach markets, which were known in north-western Europe, during the Viking period, were primarily associated with the sale of fish.Dijkman, J.E.C., Shaping Medieval Markets: The Organisation of Commodity Markets in Holland, C. 1200 - C. 1450, Brill, 2011, pp 122-23 From around the 11th-century, the number and variety of imported goods sold at beach markets began to increase. giving consumers access to a broader range of exotic and luxury goods.Schofield, J. and Vince, A.G., British Towns in Their European Setting, A&C; Black, 2003, p. 160 Throughout the Medieval period, markets became more international. The historian, Braudel, reports that, in 1600, grain moved just 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. However, following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, 1992 Pieter Brueghel, the younger, late 16th century Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise.Borsay, P. and Proudfoot, L., Provincial Towns in Early Modern England and Ireland: Change, Convergence and Divergence, [The British Academy], Oxford University Press, 2002, pp 65-66 A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as the consumer's perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. Such considerations informed decisions about where to make purchases and which markets to patronise.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\\" Business History Review, Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, p. 27 As the number of charters granted increased, competition between market towns also increased. In response to competitive pressures, towns invested in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors such as covered accommodation. By the thirteenth century, counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as Bristol red, Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\\" Business History Review, Vol 85, Spring, 2011, p. 28 In the market economy, goods are ungraded and unbranded, so that consumers have relatively few opportunities to evaluate quality prior to consumption.Bevan, A. and Wengrow, D., \\"Cultures of Commodity Branding, Routledge, 2016, p. 22 Consequently, supervision of weights, measures, food quality and prices was a key consideration. In medieval society, regulations for such matters appeared initially at the local level. The Charter of Worcester, written between 884 and 901 provided for fines for dishonest trading, amongst other things. Such local regulations were codified in 15th century England in what became known as the Statute of Winchester. This document outlines the Assizes for 16 different trades, most of which were associated with markets - miller, baker, fisher, brewer, inn-keeper, tallow- chandler, weaver, cordwainer etc. For each trade, regulations covered such issues as fraud, prices, quality, weights and measures and so on. The assize was a formal codification of prior informal codes which had been practised for many years. The courts of assize were granted the power to enforce these regulations. The process of standardizing quality, prices and measures assisted markets to gain the confidence of buyers and made them more attractive to the public.Davis, J., \\"Market Regulation in 15th Century England,\\" Ben Dodds and Christian Drummond Liddy (eds), Commercial Activity, Markets and Entrepreneurs in the Middle Ages, Woodbridge, Boydell Press, pp 85-93 A sixteenth century commentator, John Leland, described particular markets as \\"celebrate,\\" \\"very good\\" and \\"quik,” and, conversely, as “poore,” “meane,” and “of no price.\\" Over time, some products became associated with particular places, providing customers with valuable information about the types of goods, their quality and their region of origin. In this way, markets helped to provide an early form of product branding.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\\" Business History Review, Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, p. 28 Gradually, certain market towns earned a reputation for providing quality produce. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic chartered markets. An 18th century commentator, Daniel Defoe visited Sturbridge fair in 1723 and wrote a lengthy description which paints a picture of a highly organised, vibrant operation which attracted large number of visitors from some distance away. \\"As for the people in the fair, they all universally eat, drink and sleep in their booths, and tents; and the said booths are so intermingled with taverns, coffee-houses, drinking-houses, eating-houses, cookshops &c;, and all tents too, and so many butchers and higglers from all the neighbouring counties come in to the fair every morning, with beef, mutton, fowls, bread, cheese, eggs and such things; and go with them from tent to tent and from door to door, that there is no want of provision of any kind, either dress'd or undress'd.\\"Daniel Defoe, Ultimate Collection: 50+ Adventure Classics, Pirate Tales & Historical Novels- including Biographies, Historical Sketches, Poems and Essays, [E-book] 2016 =In the Middle East= Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is thought to be one of the oldest continuously operating market buildings in existence and houses some 3600 retail shops In the Middle East, prior to the 10th century, market places were situated on the perimeter of the city. Along established trade routes, markets were most often associated with the caravanserai typically situated just outside the city walls. However, when the marketplace began to become integrated into city structures, it was transformed into a covered area where traders could buy and sell with some protection from the elements. Markets at Mecca and Medina were known to be significant trade centres in the 3rd century (CE) and the nomadic communities were highly dependent on them for both trade and social interactions.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 pp 14-15 The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating, purpose-built market; its construction began in 1455. =In Mesoamerica= In Mesoamerica, a tiered system of traders developed independently. Extensive trade networks predated the Aztec empire by at least hundreds of years. Local markets where people purchased their daily necessities were known as tianguis, while a pochteca was a professional merchant who travelled long distances to obtain rare goods or luxury items desired by the nobility. The system supported various levels of pochteca - from very high status through to minor traders who acted as a type of peddler to fill in gaps in the distribution system.Salomón, F., \\"Pochteca and mindalá: a comparison of long-distance traders in Ecuador and Mesoamerica,\\" Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society, Vol. 1-2, 1978, pp 231-246 Colonial sources also record Mayan market hubs at Acalan, Champotón, Chetumal, Bacalar, Cachi, Conil, Pole, Cozumel, Cochuah, Chauaca, Chichén Itzá as well as markets marking the edges of Yucatecan canoe trade such as Xicalanco and Ulua.Masson, M.A. and Freide, D.A., \\"An argument for Classic Era Maya Market Exchange,\\" Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, Vi., 31, 2012, p.457 The Spanish conquerors commented on the impressive nature of the local markets in the 15th century. The Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas and said to be superior to those in Europe. Types There are many different ways to classify markets. One way is to consider the nature of the buyer and the market's place within the distribution system. This leads to two broad classes of market, namely retail market or wholesale markets. The economist, Alfred Marshall classified markets according to time period. In this classification, there are three types of market; the very short period market where the supply of a commodity remains fixed. Perishables, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish fall into this group since goods must be sold within a few days and the quantity supplied is relatively inelastic. The second group is the short period market where the time in which the quantity supplied can be increased by improving the scale of production (adding labor and other inputs but not by adding capital). Many non-perishable goods fall into this category. The third category is the long-period market where the length of time can be improved by capital investment.Marshall, A., Principles of Economics, Vol. 1. London, Macmillan, 1890; Principles of Economics, 8th ed.,1920, London, Macmillan Other ways to classify markets include its trading area (local, national or international); its physical format or its produce. Major physical formats of markets are: *Bazaar: typically a covered market in the Middle East *Car boot sale - a type of market where people come together to trade household and garden goods; very popular in the United Kingdom *Dry market: a market selling durable goods such as fabric and electronics as distinguished from \\"wet markets\\" *E-commerce: an online marketplace for consumer products which can be sold anywhere in the world * *Indoor market of any sort *Marketplace: an open space where a market is or was formerly held in a town *Market square in Europe: open area usually in town centre with stalls selling goods in a public square *Public market in the United States: an indoor, fixed market in a building and selling a variety of goods *Street market: a public street with stalls along one or more sides of the street *Floating market: where goods are sold from boats, chiefly found in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam *Night market: popular in many countries in Asia, opening at night and featuring much street food and a more leisurely shopping experience. In Indonesia and Malaysia they are known as pasar malam *Wet market (also known as a public market): a market selling fresh meat, fish, produce, and other perishable goods as distinguished from \\"dry markets\\"Wholesale Markets: Planning and Design Manual (Fao Agricultural Services Bulletin) (No 90) Markets may feature a range of merchandise for sale, or they may be one of many specialist markets, such as: *Animal markets (i.e. livestock markets) *Antique markets *Farmers' markets, focusing on fresh produce and gourmet food lines (preserves, chutneys, relishes, cheeses etc.) prepared from farm produce *Fish markets *Flea markets or swap meets, a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise. Used goods, low quality items, and high quality items at low prices are commonplace *Flower markets, such as the Mercado Jamaica in Mexico City and the Bloemenmarkt in Amsterdam *Food halls, featuring gourmet food to consume on- and off-premises,\\"The 5 Best Food Halls in America\\", Bon Appétit magazine such as those at Harrods (London) and Galeries Lafayette (Paris) department stores. In North America, these may be also referred to simply as \\"markets\\" (or \\"mercados\\" in Spanish), such as the West Side Market in Cleveland, Ponce City Market in Atlanta, and the Mercado Roma in Mexico City. *Grey market: where second hand or recycled goods are sold (sometimes termed a green market) *Handicraft markets *Markets selling items used in the occult (for magic, by witches, etc.) *Supermarkets and hypermarkets File:Schaufschod 2009 11.JPGLivestock market at Schaufschod, 2009 File:Grand-Bazaar Shop.jpgBazaar: Grand Bazaar, Istanbul, Turkey File:Krakow rynek 01.jpgMarketplace: Main Market Square, Kraków, Poland: Europe's largest medieval town square File:Damoen Saduk Floating Market.jpgFloating market: Damnoen Saduak floating market in Ratchaburi, Thailand, is a famous tourist attraction.

Pieter Aertsen was known as the \\"great painter of the market.\\" Both he and his nephew, Joachim Beuckelaer, painted market scenes, street vendors and merchants extensively.Honig, E.A., Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp, Yale University Press, 1998, p.24 Elizabeth Honig argues that painters' interest in markets was in part due to the changing nature of the market system at that time. The public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the meerseniers which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the koopman, which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.Honig, E.A., Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp, Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10 During the 17th and 18th centuries, as Europeans conquered parts of North Africa and the Levant, European artists began to visit the Orient and painted scenes of everyday life. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups - the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other. Europeans often saw Orientals as the photographic negative of Western civilisation; the peoples could be threatening- they were \\"despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational.\\"Nanda, S. and Warms, E.L., Cultural Anthropology, Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 330 At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. Artists focussed on the exotic beauty of the land - the markets and bazaars, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favourite subject matter, and the high vaulted market places features in numerous paintings and sketches.Nanda, S. and Warms, E.L., Cultural Anthropology, Cengage Learning, 2010, pp 330-331 Individual markets have also attracted literary attention. Les Halles was known as the \\"Belly of Paris\\", and was so named by author, Émile Zola in his novel Le Ventre de Paris, which is set in the busy 19th century marketplace of central Paris. Les Halles, a complex of market pavilions in Paris, features extensively in both literature and painting. Giuseppe Canella (1788 - 1847) painted Les Halles et la rue de la Tonnellerie. Photographer, Henri Lemoine (1848 - 1924), also photographed Les Halles de Paris. Around the world =Africa= Markets have been known in parts of Africa for centuries. An 18th century commentator noted the many markets he visited in West Africa. He provided a detailed description of market activities at Sabi, in the Wydah, (now the part of the Republic of Benin): : \\"Their fairs and markets are regulated with so much care and prudence, that nothing contrary to law is ever committed. All sorts of merchandise here are collected, and those who have brought goods are permitted to take what time they please to dispose of them, but without fraud or noise. A judge, attended by four officers armed, is appointed by the King for the inspection of goods, to hear and determine all grievances, complaints and disputes... The market place is surrounded by butlers and booths, and places of refreshment for the conveniency of the people. They are only permitted to sell certain sorts of meats, pork, goats, beef and dog flesh. Other booths are kept by women who sell maize, millet, rice and corn bread. Other shops sell Pito, a sort of pleasant and wholesome, and very refreshing beer. Palm wine, acqua vita and spirits which they get from the Europeans, are kept in other shops, with restrictions on sale to prevent drunkenness and riots. Here slaves of both sexes are bought and sold, also oxen, sheep, dogs, hogs, shish and birds of all kind. Woollen cloths, linen, silks and calicoes of European and Indian manufacture, they have it in great abundance, likewise hard-ware, china and glass of all sorts; gold in dust and ingots, iron in bars, lead in sheets and everything of European, Asiatic or African production is here found at reasonable prices.\\"The Modern Part of an Universal History: From the Earliest Account of Time, Vol 7, by the authors of the Ancient Part, London, Richardson, 1760, pp 397-98 In the Republic of Benin, he commented on the exotic foods available for sale at a market there: :\\" Besides the dry merchandise of which the markets of Benin abound, they are also well stocked with eatables, a little particular in kind. Here they expose dogs to sale for eating, of which the negroes are very fond. Roasted monkeys, apes and baboons are every where to be seen. Bats, rats and lizards dried in the sun, palm wine and fruit, form the must luxurious entertainments, and stand continually for sale in the streets.\\"The Modern Part of an Universal History: From the Earliest Account of Time, Vol 7, by the authors of the Ancient Part, London, Richardson, 1760, p. 363 Botswana The sale of agricultural produce to the formal market is largely controlled by large corporations. Most small, local farmers sell their produce to the informal market, local communities and street vendors.Madisa, M.E., Obopile, M. and Assefa, Y., \\"Analysis of Horticultural Production Trends in Botswana,\\" Journal of Plant Studies, Vol 1, No. 1, 2012, pp 25-32 The main wholesale market is the Horticultural market in Gaborone. The government made some attempts to build markets in the north of the country, but that was largely unsuccessful and most commercial buyers travel to Johannesburg or Tshwane for supplies.Cordes, M., \\"SADC markets?\\" Farmer's Weekly, 26 May 2016, pp 397-98 Ethiopia Ethiopia is a major producer and exporter of grains and a number of wholesale markets assist with the distribution and export of such products. Important wholesale markets include: Nekempte and Jaji in the Wollega region, Assela and agure in the Arsi region, Bahir Dar and Bure in the Gojjam region, Dessie and Kombolcha in the Wollo region, Mekele in the Tigray region, Dire Dawa and Harar in the Hararghe region, and Addis Ababa.

In the late 1970s, the Ghanaian government used market traders as a scapegoat for its own policy failures which involved food shortages and high inflation. The government blamed traders for failing to observe pricing guidelines and vilified \\"women merchants\\". In 1979, the Makola market was dynamited and bulldozed, but within a week the traders were back selling fruit, vegetables and fish, albeit without a roof over their head.McMillan, J., Reinventing the Bazaar: A Natural History of Markets, New York, NY, Norton, 2002. p.18 File:Kumasi Market.jpgKumasi Market in Ghana File:Ghana Market.jpgMarket between Accra and Cape Coast, Ghana File:Madina ghana market4.jpgMadina Ghana Market File:Market in Anaynui, Ghana.jpgMarket in Anaynui, Ghana File:Street Outside Makola Market, Accra, Ghana.JPGStreet Outside Makola Market, Accra, Ghana Kenya Kenya's capital, Nairobi, has several major markets.

Shopping at a produce market is a standard feature of daily life in Morocco. In the larger cities, Medinas are typically made up of a collection of souks built amid a maze of narrow streets and laneways where independent vendors and artisans tend to cluster in sections which subsequently become known for a particular type of produce - such as the silversmith's street or the textile district. In Tangiers, a sprawling market fills the many streets of the medina and this area is divided into two sections, known as the Grand Socco and the Petit Socco. The term 'socco' is a Spanish corruption of the Arabic word for souk, meaning marketplace.Dane, R., Lost on the Way: Adventures in 40,000 Miles of Hitchhiking, Bloomington, 2011, p. 140 These markets sell a large variety of goods; fresh produce, cooking equipment, pottery, silverware, rugs and carpets, leather goods, clothing, accessories, electronics alongside cafes, restaurants and take-away food stalls. The Medina at Fez is the oldest, having been founded in the 9th century. The Medina at Fez has been named a World Heritage site. Today it is the main fresh produce market and is noted for its narrow laneways and for a total ban on motorized traffic. All produce is brought in and out of the marketplace by donkey or hand-cart. In Marrakesh, the main produce markets are also to be found in the Medina and a colourful market is also held daily in the Jemaa el-Fnaa (main square) where roaming performers and musicians entertain the large crowds that gather there. Marrakesh has the largest traditional Berber market in Morocco.

Government sponsored initiatives have encouraged producers to grow fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes and grainsMsangi. J.P., Food Security Among Small- Scale Agricultural Producers in Southern Africa, Springer, 2014, pp 53-54 The Namibian Ministry of Agriculture has recently launched a system of fresh produce hubs to serve as a platform for producers to market and distribute their produce. It is anticipated that these hubs will assist in curbing the number of sellers who take their produce to South Africa where it is placed on cold storage, only to be imported back into the country at a later date.\\"Ongwediva fresh produce market opens for trade,\\" Namibian Sun, 1 December 2013 File:Market Scene Oshakati Namibia.jpgMarket Scene Oshakati Namibia File:Street Market in Namibia - Windhoek.jpgStreet Market in Namibia, Windhoek File:Swakopmund-Marché artisanal (1).jpgArtisans' Market, Swakopmund File:Marché artisanal d'Okahandja (1).jpgArtisan's market, d'Okahandja File:Oshakati New market 2016-2.jpgOshakati New market, 2016 Nigeria South Africa Fresh produce markets have traditionally dominated the South African food chain, handling more than half of all fresh produce. Although large, vertically integrated food retailers, such as supermarkets, are beginning to make inroads into the supply chain, traditional hawkers and produce markets have shown remarkable resilience.Madevu, H., Louw, A. and Ndanga, L. \\"Mapping the Competitive Food Chain in Tsambe, South Africa,\\" Conference Paper presented to The International Association of Agricultural Economists, Beijing, China, August 16–22, 2009 The main markets in Johannesburg are: Jozi Real Food Market, Bryanston Organic Market, Pretoria Boeremark specialising in South African delicacies, Hazel Food Market, Panorama Flea Market, Rosebank Sunday Market, Market on Main - a periodic arts market and Neighbourhood Markets. The Gambia The \\"Gambia is Good\\" initiative was established in 2004 with a view to encouraging a market for locally grown fresh produce rather than imported ones. The plan was designed to \\"stimulate local livelihoods, inspire entrepreneurship and reduce the environmental and social cost of imported produce.\\"Holden, A and Fennell, D.A. (eds), \\"The Routledge Handbook of Tourism and the Environment,\\" Ixon, Routledge, 2013, pp 396-98 A great deal of the produce trade is carried out informally on street corners and many shops are little more than market booths.Gregg, E. and Trillo, R., The Rough Guide to the Gambia, Rough Guides, 2004, p. 98 However, dedicated open air and covered markets can be found in the larger towns. Notable markets include: the Serekunda Market in Gambia's largest city, Serekunda, which opens from early morning to late at night 7 days a week and trades in produce, live animals, clothing, accessories, jewellery, crafts, second hand goods and souvenirs; The Albert Market in the capital, Banjul which sells fresh produce, colourful, locally designed fabrics, musical instruments, carved wooden masks and other local products. Other interesting markets include: Bakau Fish Market in Bakau; Tanji Fish Market, Tanji, where brightly-painted fishing boats bring in the fish from where it is immediately preserved using traditional methods and prepared for distribution to other West African countries; The Woodcarvers Market in Brikama which boasts the largest concentration of woodcarvers in the country; the Pottery Market in Basse Santa; the Atlantic Road Craft Market at Bakau and the Senegambia Craft Market at Bakau.

Many supermarkets purchase directly from producers, supplanting the traditional role of both wholesale and retail markets. In order to survive, produce markets have been forced to consider value adding opportunities and many retail markets now focus on ready-to-eat food and take-away food.Holtzman, J.S. and Menegay, M., Urban Wholesale Marketplaces for Fresh Produce in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore: Lessons Learned and Potential Applications for Asia, [Technical Report No. 9], Agribusiness Project, 1993, pp 3-6  East Asia  = China = In China, the existence of street and wet markets has been known for centuries, however, many of these were restricted in the 1950s and 60s and only permitted to re-open in 1978.Bijman, J. (ed), \\"International Agri-food Chains and Networks: Management and Organization,\\" Netherlands, Wageningen Academics, 2006 p.217 The distinction between wholesale and retail markets is somewhat ambiguous in China, since many markets serve both as distribution centres and retail shopping venues. To assist in the distribution of food, more than 9,000 wholesale produce markets operate in China.Waters, H.J., China's Economic Development Strategies for the 21st Century, p. 86 Some of these markets operate on a very large scale. For example, Beijing's Xinfadi Wholesale market, currently under renovation, is expected to have a footprint of 112 hectares when complete. The Beijing Zoo Market (retail market) is a collection of 12 different markets, comprising some 20,000 tenant stall-holders, 30,000 employees and more than 100,000 customers daily. China is both a major importer and exporter of fruit and vegetables and is now the world's largest exporter of apples. In addition to produce markets, China has many specialised markets such as a silk market, clothing markets and an antiques market. China's fresh produce market is undergoing major change. In the larger cities, purchasing is gradually moving to online with door-to-door deliveries. Some of the more important markets in China include: :Wholesale produce market: Xinfadi (wholesale produce market, Beijing) - with an annual turnover volume of 14 million tonnes of meat, fruit and vegetables, it supplies 70 percent of Beijing's vegetables and Nanzhan (Shenyang, Liaoning) which supplies the northern provinces. : Retail produce markets: The Fresh Produce Market at Hutong market (Beijing); Xiabu Xiabu market (Beijing), Panjiayuan market (Beijing); Dazhongsi market (Beijing), Tianyi market (Beijing), Beijing Zoo market, Dahongmen market (Fengtai District, Beijing), Sanyuanli market (Beijing), Shengfu Xiaoguan morning market (Beijing), Lishuiqiao seafood farmers’ market (Beijing), Wangjing Zonghe market (Beijing), Chaowai market (Beijing), Zhenbai market (Shanghai's largest produce market) File:5646-Linxia-City-market-porcelain-and- traditional-Linxia-sunglasses.jpgHui vendors at Linxia City Market File:Beijing silk market.jpgBeijing silk market File:Panjiayuan Market Beijing China.jpgPanjiayuan Market, Beijing (exterior) File:2016-09-10 Beijing Panjiayuan market 30 anagoria.jpgPanjiayuan Market, Beijing (external stallholder) File:2016-09-10 Beijing Panjiayuan market 74 anagoria.jpgPanjiayuan Market, Beijing (interior)  Hong Kong  Hong Kong relies heavily imports to meet its fresh produce needs. Importers are consequently an important part of the distribution network, and some importers supply directly to retail consumers. Holtzman, J.S. and Menegay, M., Urban Wholesale Marketplaces for Fresh Produce in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore: Lessons Learned and Potential Applications for Asia, [Technical Report No. 9], Agribusiness Project, 1993, p.14 Street markets in Hong Kong are held every day except on a few traditional Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year. Stalls opened at two sides of a street are required to have licenses issued by the Hong Kong Government. The various types of street markets include fresh foods, clothing, cooked foods, flowers and electronics. The earliest form of market was a Gaa si (wet market). Some traditional markets have been replaced by shopping centres, markets in municipal service buildings and supermarkets, while others have become tourist attractions such as Tung Choi Street and Apliu Street. The Central Market, Hong Kong is a grade II listed building. = Japan = * Tsukiji fish market * Kochi Sunday Market * Hirome Ichiba = South Korea = Although the majority of markets in South Korea are wholesale markets, retail customers are permitted to make purchases in all of them. The Gwangjang Market is the nation's top market and is a popular tourist destination. = Taiwan = : Taiwan meets most of its produce needs through local production. This means that the country has a very active network of wholesale and retail markets.Holtzman, J.S. and Menegay, M., Urban Wholesale Marketplaces for Fresh Produce in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore: Lessons Learned and Potential Applications for Asia, [Technical Report No. 9], Agribusiness Project, 1993, p.12 According to the Guardian newspaper, Taiwan has \\"the best night market scene in the world and some of the most exciting street food in Asia.\\"  South Asia  In South Asia, especially Nepal, India and Bangladesh, a Haat (also known as hat) refers to a regular rural produce market, typically held once or twice per week.Crow, B., Markets, Class and Social Change: Trading Networks and Poverty in Rural South Asia, Palgrave, 2001, [Glossary] p. xvii = India = The marketing historian, Petty, has suggested that Indian marketplaces first arose during the Chola Dynasty (approx. 850 -1279CE) during a period of favourable economic conditions. Distinct types of markets were evident; nagaaram (streets of shops, often devoted to specific types of goods; angadi (markets) and perangadi (large markets in the inner city districts).Sreekumar, H. and Varman, J., \\"History of Marketing in India,\\" in The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, D.G. Brian Jones, Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 309- 406 The sub-continent may have borrowed the concept of covered marketplaces from the Middle East around the tenth century with the arrival of Islam. The caravanserai and covered market structures, known as suqs, first began to appear along the silk routes and were located in the area just outside the city perimeter. Following the tradition established on the Arabian peninsula, India also established temporary-seasonal markets in regional districts. In Rajasthan's Pushkar, an annual camel market was first recorded in the 15th century. However, following the foundation of the Mughal Empire in northern India during the 16th century, this arrangement changed. A covered bazaar or market place became integrated into city structures and was to be found in the city centre. Markets and bazaars were well known in the colonial era. Some of these bazaars appear to have specialised in particular types of produce. The Patna district, in the 17th century, was home to 175 weaver villages and the Patna Bazaar enjoyed a reputation as a centre of trade in fine cloth. When the Italian writer and traveller, Niccolao Manucci, visited there in 1863, he found many merchants trading in cotton and silk in Patna's bazaars.Yang, A.A., Bazaar India: Markets, Society, and the Colonial State in Bihar, University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif, p. 59 In India today, many different types of market serve retail and commercial clients: (1) Wholesale markets :* Primary wholesale markets: held once or twice per week, these sell produce from local villages e.g. Rice Bazaar at Thissur in Kerala :* Secondary wholesale markets (also known as mandis): smaller merchants purchase from primary markets and sell at secondary markets. A small number of primary producers may sell direct to mandis. :* Terminal markets: Markets that sell directly to the end-user, whether it be the consumer, food processor or shipping agent for export to foreign countries e.g. Bombay Terminal Market (2) Retail markets :* Retail markets: spread across villages, towns and cities :* Fairs: held on religious days and deal in livestock and agricultural produce In India (and also Bangladesh and Pakistan), a landa bazaar is a type of a bazaar or a marketplace with lowest prices where only secondhand general goods are exchanged or sold. A haat also refers to a bazaar or market in Bangladesh and Pakistan and the term may also be used in India. A saddar refers to the main, central market in a town while a mandi refers to a large marketplace. A Meena Bazaar is a marketplace where goods are sold in an effort to raise money for charity.

Southeast Asia  Southeast Asia is noted for its night markets, floating markets and pirate markets (markets that specialise in selling \\"knock off\\" copies of designer brands). Some Asian countries have developed unique distribution systems and highly specialised types of market place. Throughout Asia, a wet market refers to a place where fruit, vegetables, fish, seafood and meat products are sold. Throughout much of Asia, produce markets are known as morning markets due to their hours of operation, while night markets specialise in selling non- perishables including clothing, accessories, local artefacts, souvenirs and a wide assortment of personal goods. = Cambodia =  Phnom Penh  * Central Market, Phnom Penh = Indonesia = In Indonesia, a Pasar pagi is a particular type of wet market, also known as a \\"morning market\\" which typically operates from early morning to the afternoon. Pasar malam refers to a night market operated in later hours from late afternoon to night, approximately from 17:00 to 22:00, and only on selected days of a week. The types of goods being sold is also quite different. Pasar pagi is where many housewives, domestic help, and local folks appear to shop their daily needs, mostly fresh produce. The things which are on sale are usually fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, spices, fish, meat, eggs, and all kinds of perishable products. While pasar malam caters to a leisurely shopping and eating-out activity, selling ready-to-eat food, snacks, clothing, and knick- knacks. Major textile, fashion, and clothing markets in Indonesia are Tanah Abang market in central Jakarta and Pasar Baru in Bandung. Notable markets specializing in traditional batik clothing are, Pasar Klewer in Solo and Pasar Beringharjo in Yogyakarta. The major pasar pagi in Jakarta are Pasar Pagi Mangga Dua, Pasar Induk Kramat Jati, Pasar Minggu and Pasar Senen. Pasar Minggu specialized on fruits and vegetables, while Pasar Kue Subuh in Senen specialized on selling kue, as they offer a rich variety of traditional Indonesian snack, open every subuh (dawn). Notable markets in Yogyakarta, include: Pasar Beringharjo, a traditional market; Kranggan Market, a flea market; Pasar Organik Milas, organic and flea market; Malioboro Road, a street market and Yogyakarta Bird Market. Notable markets in Bali include Pasar Badung central market of Denpasar city, Pasar Seni Sukowati art market specializing in artworks and handicrafts, and Pasar Ubud. In several cities and towns in Kalimantan and Sumatra, there are floating markets, which is a collection of vendors selling various produce and product on boats. For example, the Siring floating market in Banjarmasin, and Lok Baintan floating market in Martapura, both in South Kalimantan.

Pasar pagi morning wet market is also familiar in Malaysia. In parts of Malaysia, jungle produce markets trade in indigenous fruits and vegetables, all of which are gaining popularity as consumers switch to pesticide-free food products. Some of the more nutritional indigenous produce includes fruits such as dabai (Canarium odontophyllum), kembayau (Dacryodes rostrata f. cuspidata), durian nyekak (Durio kutejensis) and durian kuning (Durio graveolens), letup (Passiflora foetida), kepayang (Pangium edule) and tubu (Pycnarrhena tumetacta) and vegetables such as tengang (Gnetum sp.) and riang batu (Begonia chlorosticia), teh kampung (Leucosyke capitellata and tongkat langit (Musa troglodytarum ).Hoe, V.B. and Siong, K.H., \\"The Nutritional Value of Indigenous Fruits and Vegetables in Sarawak\\", Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol. 8, no. 1, 1998, pp 24-31 The main markets in Kuala Lumpur include: Pudu market: rated as KL's largest wet market by the Lonely Planet Guide; Central Market, Kuala Lumpur; Chow Kit Wet Market; Kampong Bahru Pasar Minggu; China Town; Petaling Jaya SS2; Bangsar Baru and Lorong Tuanka Abdul Rahman.

Locals use palengkes for daily shopping. Public markets are the primary trading centres in cities. In rural districts, public markets are in a state of disrepair. Weekend markets are popular for organic and artisanal foods purchases. In addition, a number of farmers' markets have sprung up.Carman, T., \\"In winter, farmers markets turn into value (added) villages,\\" The Washington Post, 12 January 12, 2011 The Cubao Farmers Market, in Quezon City gained international attention following a feature spot on the cable network program, No Reservations, with Anthony Bourdain in 2009.

The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, and spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe from there. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of a city from around 3,000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar.Moosavi, M.S. \\"Bazaar and its Role in the Development of Iranian Traditional Cities\\" [Working Paper], Tabriz Azad University, Faculty of Art & Architecture, Iran, 2005, p. 2 In the ancient cities of Iran, three types of bazaar have been identified; periodic bazaars, urban bazaars and local bazaars. Periodic bazaars could be organised anywhere and typically took place in open spaces and traded in specialities such as handicrafts, clothing, livestock and foodstuffs. These took place at regular intervals such as monthly or yearly. Urban bazaars were held in covered public walkways with shops or stores on both sides. Its architecture varied according to local conditions including climate, culture and the economic power of the city in which it was situated. Urban bazaars were places for commercial, social and cultural interactions. Local bazaars, held in specific districts of larger cities, were similar to urban bazaars, but on a smaller scale with fewer shops.Moosavi, M.S. \\"Bazaar and its Role in the Development of Iranian Traditional Cities\\" [Working Paper], Tabriz Azad University, Faculty of Art & Architecture, Iran, 2005 In pre-Islamic Arabia, markets took on two forms, permanent urban markets and temporary, seasonal markets often located in regional districts. Gradually, markets or bazaars gradually became central features of urban towns and were relocated to the city centre. Permanent markets are mentioned frequently in ancient literary sources.Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce,\\" in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012, p. 5 =Iran= Markets with historical or architectural significance include: *Grand Bazaar, Tehran *Bazaar of Kashan in Iran *Bazaar of Isfahan in Iran - historic site which dates to Saljuqid and Safavid era and is the longest roofed market in the world. *Bazaar of Tabriz in Iran - an historic site that originally developed along the ancient silk routes; listed as a World Heritage Site * Vakil Bazaar in Shiraz, Iran File:Isfahan 1200977 nevit.jpgIsfahan Bazaar, Iran File:Antiguo Bazar de Kashan, Kashan, Irán, 2016-09-19, DD 86.jpgBazaar of Kashan, Kashan, Iran File:Carpet Bazaar of Tabriz.JPGCarpet Bazaar of Tabriz, Iran = Israel = The Hebrew word for market is shuk (plural: shvakim), and food markets are found in every major city.

Every district in Turkey has its own open market where people can choose and buy from a very wide range of products, from fresh fruits and vegetables to clothing, from traditional white cheese (which some people may consider feta-like) to household items. In Istanbul area Wednesday Pazar of Fatih district, Tuesday Pazar of Kadıköy and Friday Pazar of Ortaköy are the most famous and crowded open markets of the city. A market with shops or permanent stalls is called \\"çarşı\\" and may include covered streets that are closed at night.

Les Halles, a vast centralised wholesale market, was known to be in existence at least by the 13th century when it was expanded, and was only demolished in 1971 to make way for an underground shopping precinct. The French system of organised, designated central retail markets was extensively studied by architects in London with a view to emulating the system and ultimately eradicating the informal supply of produce via street vendors.Jones, P.T.A., \\"Redressing Reform Narratives: Victorian London's Street Markets and the Informal Supply Lines of Urban Modernity,\\" The London Journal, Vol 41, No. 1, 2006. p. 75, DOI: 10.1179/1749632215Y.0000000013 * Raspail Market, Paris File:Louise Moillon - At the Market Stall - WGA16074.jpgAt the market stall, painting by Louise Moillon, 1609 File:Street market rue Mouffetard St Medard dsc00727.jpgStreet market, Rue Mouffetard.

A small number are operated by private groups or individuals. Traders can be licensed to trade on a single pitch but not at a national level or when trading on private land. This piecemeal licensing system has contributed to declining public confidence in the reputation of markets. A voluntary scheme has been set up by The Market People, backed by the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA) to address this problem. It provides consumers with traceability of traders and goods as well as the ability to rate and contact the traders. A MarketPASS is issued to an operator or trader, once they have provided proof of identity, insurance and, where required, a hygiene certificate. A study conducted by the Retail Alliance noted that Britain had 1,124 traditional retail markets, 605 farmers’ markets, 26 wholesale markets and more than 45,700 retail traders and that retail markets had an annual turnover of over £3.5 billion while wholesale markets had turnover of £4.1 billion annually. The data also shows that traditional outdoor street markets continue to dominate the market space, but are in decline. Markets also have significant appeal for tourists and visitors.Hallsworth, A., Ntounis, N., Parker, C. and Quin, S., Markets Matter: Reviewing the evidence & detecting the market effect, [Report], Institute of Place Management, Manchester Metropolitan University, 2015, p. 15 Some researchers make a distinction between traditional markets and gentrified markets. Traditional markets which are primarily held outdoors on specific days, focus on high volume produce sold with low margins. In the gentrified market, the focus is on specialty produce, notably organic foods, hyper-local produce, artisanal products, vintage clothing or designer brands. Whereas traditional markets are in decline, gentrified markets represent a major growth opportunity.Gonzales, S. and Dawson, G., Traditional Markets Under Threat: Why It's Happening and What Traders Can Do, n.d., circa 2016, pp 21-22; Gonzalez, S. and Waley, P, \\"Traditional Retail Markets: The New Gentrification Frontier?\\" Antipode, Vol. 45, no. 4, 2016 pp.965-983 File:Jacques-Laurent Agasse - Old Smithfield Market - Google Art Project.jpgOld Smithfield Market painting by Jacques-Laurent Agasse, 1824 File:Market Square in 1853, Portsmouth, NH.jpgMarket Square in Portsmouth, 1853 File:Leadenhall Market entrance Illustrated London New 1881.jpgLondon's Leadenhall market (exterior), 1881 File:Market Day in Stockport 1910s.jpgMarket Day in Stockport, 1910s File:Bryant, Henry Charles - The Market Stall - 20th century.jpgThe Market Stall by Henry Charles Bryant, early 20th century England's chartered markets and fairs From the 11th century, the English monarchs awarded a charter to local lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter granted the lords the right to take tolls from vendors and also afforded some protection to a town from rival markets. Once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days.Dyer, C., Everyday Life in Medieval England, London, Hambledon and London, 1994, pp. 283–303 Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise.Borsay, P. and Proudfoot, L., Provincial Towns in Early Modern England and Ireland: Change, Convergence and Divergence, [The British Academy], Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 65–66 Gradually these market towns developed a reputation for quality or for trade in specific types of goods. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard these historic charters. =County markets= * Covered Market, Oxford, Oxfordshire * Covered Market, Preston * Leeds Kirkgate Market, Yorkshire * Old Market, Bristol Gloucestershire * The Old Market, Hove * Market Harborough Leicestershire File:Salisbury Market 20040724.jpgSalisbury chartered market File:Sedbergh charter market.jpgSedbergh chartered market File:Market Square, Huntingdon - geograph.org.uk - 1429707.jpgMarket Square, Huntingdon File:Northampton Market Square Lights 9.jpgNorthampton Market is thought to be England's oldest continuously operating chartered market File:Altrincham, Charter Market - geograph.org.uk - 1313227.jpgAltrincham, Chartered Market London Between the 13th century and the Great Fire of 1666, London's main market was the Stocks Market, \\"on the site of the fixed pillory where traders were punished who fell foul of the Assize Courts.\\" The Stocks Market was removed in 1737 as part of Christopher Wren's plans to rebuild the city. New wholesale markets were erected in strategic locations and these prospered until well into the 19th century with some continuing until modern times. The wholesale markets were highly controlled, closed environments that were minutely regulated and meticulously planned. These included Smithfield Meat Market (built in 1866), Billingsgate Fish Market (constructed in 1875) and Leadenhall Market (completed in 1881). The retail trade was largely serviced by itinerant street sellers or costermongers. In central London, costermongers worked along designated routes, selling door-to-door or by trading from some 36 unauthorised, but highly organised markets situated along major thoroughfares or meeting places such as Whitecross Street, Covent Garden and Leather Lane. In an attempt to regulate street trading, a number of authorised retail markets were built during the 19th century with limited success. Examples of retail markets constructed during this period include: St James, St George's (Southwark), Carnaby, Hungerford, Randall's (Poplar, London), Fitzroy, Finsbury, and the People's Market (Whitechapel), Angela Burdett-Coutts’ Market and Columbia Road Market (now a flower market). Retail markets were less successful than their wholesale counterparts and the number of retail markets declined from 24 in 1800 to 17 in 1840. In reality, London's working classes generally preferred the convenience of street trading which continued to thrive until the 20th century.Jones, P.T.A., \\"Redressing Reform Narratives: Victorian London's Street Markets and the Informal Supply Lines of Urban Modernity,\\" The London Journal, Vol 41, No. 1, 2006. pp 60-81, DOI: 10.1179/1749632215Y.0000000013 Charles Knight devoted an entire section to markets in his pictorial essay, Pictorial Half-hours of London Topography, (1851) in which he identifies the main wholesale markets as the Corn Market; the Coal Exchange; Billingsgate - the main fish market; Smithfield - a cattle market since at least 1150. Retail meat markets include Newgate; Whitechapel; Newgate; Newport, Oxford; St George's and Shepherd's Market in Mayfair. Produce markets included Covent Garden, which Knight considered to be the 'pre-eminent' vegetable market; Farringdon Market between Holborn Hill and Fleet Street; Spitalfields - the largest potato market in London; Portman Market, Hungerford Market and Leadenhall Market- a mixed produce and meat market. In addition, the Skin Market at Bermondsey dealt in leather and hay markets were held at Whitechapel, Cumberland Market, Regent's Park and Smithfield.Knight, C., Pictorial Half-hours of London Topography, Fleet Street, London, Knight, 1851 Some examples of street markets operating today include Berwick Street Market, Broadway Market, Camden Market, East Street Market, Petticoat Lane and Portobello Road Market. The most popular for food is Borough Market which sell most fresh produce as well as having a bakery.

They are very common all over Greece, including the capital, Athens. Regular (weekly) morning markets sell mostly fresh produce from farming cooperatives – fruit, vegetables, fish and flowers/plants. Some household items and prepared foods are often available. Annual street markets (panigyri(a)) occur around churches on the day of their patron saint. These take place in the evenings and have a more festive character, often involving attractions and food stalls. The goods sold range from clothing and accessories to household items, furniture, toys and trinkets. Athens also has several bazaars/enclosed markets. * New Market (Nea Agora), Rhodes Island, Greece * Central Municipal Market, Athinas Street, Athens - a 19th-century market = Italy = *Campo de' Fiori, Rome * - seasonal wine fair, Greve, ChiantiFirenze e provincia: Fiesole, le colline il Mugello, il Valdarno e il Chianti, Touring Editore, 2003, p. 167 * - seasonal handicrafts' market, Fortezza da BassoTouring Club Italiano, Florence: A Complete Guide to the Renaissance City, Touring Editore, 1999, p. 25 * - seasonal antiques' market, Palazzo Shrozzi * , FlorenceTouring Club Italiano, Florence: A Complete Guide to the Renaissance City, Touring Editore, 1999, p. 146 * Testaccio Market, Rome  Ancient and historic Italian market places  *Trajan's Market, Rome - ruins of ancient market place * Loggia de Mercato Nuovo, Florence, built between 1547 and 1551 by Giovanni Battista del Tasso and is currently under restorationTouring Club Italiano, Florence: A Complete Guide to the Renaissance City, Touring Editore, 1999, p. 48 * Loggia de Mercado Vecchio, now demolished = Spain = In Spain, two types of retail market can be identified; permanent markets and periodic markets. Permanent markets are typically housed in a building dedicated to the use of stallholders and vendors. Periodic markets appear in the streets and plazas on specific days, such as weekends or festival days and most often sell products made by local artisans including leather goods, fashion accessories, especially scarves and costume jewellery. Vendors at periodic markets typically erect tents or canvas awnings to provide some type of temporary cover for themselves and shoppers. Produce markets, farmers' markets and flea markets are all commonplace. In addition, street vendors are a relatively common sight across most parts of Spain. Street vendors roam around in search of a suitable venue such as a plaza, entrance to a railway station or beach front where they lay their goods out on mats. Products sold by street vendors are of highly variable quality.  Barcelona  The first reliable recorded references to markets in Barcelona date to the 10th century. Barcelona, at that time, was a walled city and the first open-air market was held outside the walls, (in the area now known as Plaça de l'Àngel). A merchant district soon grew up around the market. During the 19th century, numerous covered markets were erected, specifically Santa Caterina Market (1844); San Josep (c. 1840), Llibertat (1875), San Antoni (1882), Barceloneta (1884), Concepció and Hostafrancs (1888), Clot and Poblenou (1889) and Abaceria in Gracia (1892). Barcelona residents are well served by the city's 39 produce markets. Every barrio (suburb) has at least one fresh produce market. It is often said that no matter where you find yourself in Barcelona, you are never more than 10 minutes walk from a market. Barcelona's markets attract some 62 million visits yearly, turnover €950million and employ 7,500 people.Barcelona Institute of Markets, Markets: The Barcelona Experience, n.d. c. 2015; p. 8, www.bcn.cat/mercats Some of the larger produce markets still in operation include: La Boqueria; Mercat del Born - a modernist construction, Mercat de San Antoni located in the barrio, San Antoni; Mercat de San Andreu in San Andreu; Mercat de Santa Caterina in L'Eixample, Mercat de Ninot, in L'Eixample; Mercat de la Concepció also in L'Eixample; Mercat de la Llibertat in Gràcia; Mercat de Sants in Sants-Montjuich; Mercat de Galvany in Sarrià- Sant Gervasi; Mercat de Vall d'Hebron. In addition, Barcelona offers many non- food markets including the street market, La Flor de Las Ramblas, Dominical de Sant Antoni, Encants de Sant Antoni and Encants Barcelona - Fira de Bellcaire.

Popular with both locals and visitors, a distinctive feature is the quality of fresh fish and seafood, which once purchased can be taken to the street stalls around the perimeter of the market who will cook it to order. The Mercado de Colón in Eixample, Valencia is also a very popular fresh produce market.

A public market has a sponsoring entity that has legal and financial responsibility to oversee operations and, sometimes, provides facilities to house the market activity. Public markets may incorporate the traditional market activity – the sale of fresh food from open stalls – and may also offer a wide range of different products. Public markets may incorporate elements of specialized markets such as farmers markets, craft markets, and antique markets. Traditionally public markets in the US were owned and operated by city governments, but this is no longer the case. According to the Ford Foundation, what distinguishes public markets from other types of related retail activity are three characteristics. Public markets: #have public goals, a defined civic purpose. Typically, these goals include: attracting shoppers to a central business district, providing affordable retailing opportunities to small businesses, preserving farming in the region, and activating or repurposing public space #are located in and/or create a public space in the community, where a wide range of people mix, and are, or aim to be, a heart of the community #are made up of locally owned, independent businesses operated by their owners, not franchises. This gives public markets a local flavor and unique experience.

The site is currently undergoing a site renewal project. It is a Melbourne landmark, popular with both locals and visitors. Major suburban markets include the Prahran Market, South Melbourne market and the Footscray Market. Of these, only the Prahran market retains most of its original structures. Periodic farmers' markets are also very popular in Melbourne.

The key characteristics of the PNG market are that it is dominated by producer-sellers, most of whom are women. Prices are set at the start of the day's trade, and rarely change. Haggling and aggressive selling are rarely practised. At the end of the day's trade, produce is not cleared, but rather is taken away for the seller's private consumption or is distributed among kin and close family.Karl Benediktsson, Harvesting Development: The Construction of Fresh Food Markets in Papua New Guinea, Denmark, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies, 2002, p. 24 File:Gerehu Markets Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (10697550585).jpgGerehu Markets, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea File:Picturesque New Guinea Plate XXXIII - Kerepunu Women at the Market Place of Kalo.jpgKerepunu Women at the Market Place of Kalo, 1885 File:Buin NSP Saturday market 1978.jpgBuin NSP Saturday market, 1978 File:GorokaMarket.jpgGorokaMarket =South America=  Brazil  *Mercado Municipal – São Paulo, São Paulo *Liberdade street market – São Paulo, São Paulo *Mercado Público – Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul *Mercado Municipal – Uberlândia, Minas Gerais *Mercado Modelo – Salvador, Bahia File:Sao Paulo - Mercado Municipal.JPGMercado Municipal in São Paulo, Brazil File:Açai no Mercado do Ver-o-peso.jpgAçai vendor at the Ver-o-Peso Market, Belém, Brazil File:Belem-Ver-o-pesokl.jpgFish seller at Belém, Pará, Brazil File:Vendedor de pequi.jpg\\"Vendedor de pequi\\", fruit seller, a common sight in Brazil  Chile  *Mercado Central de Santiago, the central market of Santiago de Chile Uruguay *Mercado Modelo, a central fruit and vegetable wholesale market in Montevideo See also References External links *Project for Public Spaces page on public markets Category:Bazaars Market ","title":"Marketplace"},{"id":"9801869","text":"Chambord station is a Via Rail station in Chambord, Quebec, Canada.

Microbial simultaneous nitrification-denitrification is the conversion of the ammonium ion to nitrogen gas in a single bioreactor. The process is dependent on floc characteristics, reaction kinetics, mass loading of readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand, rbCOD, and the dissolved oxygen, DO, concentrationTchobanoglous, 2003  Microbiology  The oxidation of the ammonium to nitrogen gas has been achieved with attached growth and suspended growth wastewater treatment processes. The most common bacteria responsible for the two step conversion are the autotrophic organisms, Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, and many different heterotrophs. The former obtain energy from the oxidation of ammonia, obtain carbon from CO2, and use oxygen as the electron acceptor. They are termed autotrophic because of their carbon source and termed aerobes because of their aerobic environment. The heterotrophic organisms are responsible for denitrification or the reduction of nitrate, NO3−, to nitrogen gas, N2. They use carbon from complex organic compounds, prefer low to zero dissolved oxygen, and use nitrate as the electron acceptor.  Systems Design  The most common design uses two different basins: one catering to the autotrophic bacteria and the second to the heterotrophic bacteria. However, SNdN accommodates to both in one basin with strict control of DO. This has been done in two common approaches. One is to develop an oxygen gradient by adding oxygen in one location in the basin. Near the O2 injection point, a high DO concentration is maintained allowing for nitrification and oxidation of other organic compounds. Oxygen is the electron acceptor and is depleted. The DO level in localized environments decreases with increasing distance from the injection point. In these low DO locations, the heterotrophic bacteria complete the nitrogen removal. The Orbal process is a technology in practice today using this method. The other method is to produce an oxygen gradient within the bio floc. The DO concentration remains high in the outside rings of the floc where nitrification occurs but low in the inner rings of the floc where denitrification occurs. This method is dependent on the floc size and characteristics; however controlling flocs is not well understood and is an active field of studyNielson, 2004 Typically, SNdN has slower ammonia and nitrate utilization rates as compared to separate basin designs because only a fraction of the total biomass is participating in either the nitrification or the denitrification steps. The SNdN limitation due to partial active biomass has led to research in novel bacteria and system designs.Hwang, 2005 Huang achieved significant ammonia removal in an attached growth process with ciliated columns packed with granular sulfur where the denitrifying bacteria used the sulfur as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Another well established pathway is via autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the process termed the Anammox process. It is typically used for high ammonia strength wastewater.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 311 and it contained 136 housing units. History The earliest known pioneer to settle in Harp Township was Solomon Cross who erected a log cabin deep in the solitude of a forest of oak trees in 1830. The cabin was 16'x18', square and built of rough unhewn logs. The cabin stood fifty years before it was destroyed.History of DeWitt County, Illinois: with illustrations descriptive of the scenery, and biographical sketches of some of the prominent men and pioneers. Philadelphia, PA.: W. R. Brink & Co., 1882 At about the same time as the Cross family, Jesse Mulkey and his brother- in-law Baltus Malone located in the township after a long journey from Kentucky at what would become known as Mulkey's Point. Mulkey and Malone's stay in the area would be short, abandoning their cabin after just over a year's time. Soon however, Felix Jones took possession of the old Mulkey cabin and constructed the first orchard in the township. Mulkey's Point also contained significant evidence of Indian camps and hunting grounds. Many of the trinkets and items found were shown to visitors of another early township resident, J. W. McCord. 1831 brought many new faces to the township including Isaac Davidson who came from Tennessee, but his life in the township would be very short as he died that same year. Davidson became the first burial in the township. The exact date is lost to history, but it occurred in the month of October, 1831. Soon after that same month, William Cross became the second resident to pass on. William was a brother to Solomon Cross and was buried on section thirty-two. In 1832, Harp township had a happier first as it celebrated its first marriage in the township. Mary Cross accepted the proposal of Martin Dale despite her parents opposition, and the couple were married in 1832. Tyre Harp and Joseph Harp located their families on section twenty-nine in 1831. They came to the township from Overton County, Tennessee, but had lived a brief time in Waynesville, Illinois prior to settling in Harp Township. The first school in the township was taught from the home of Tyre Harp in 1836. The following year, Tyre Harp, Pleasant Smith and Dudley Richards contributed $110 towards paying for a six months school and erected the first schoolhouse, a x18ft foot cabin where Edom Shugert from Tennessee (who had also taught in Tyre Harp's home) took charge of the school. Tyre was also a shoemaker, crafting all of the shoes for his family. The Harp family was very prominent in the township, which is in fact named after their family. They are also credited with being one of the few families of the early settlers to remain permanent residents of the township. The first land entries recorded in the township are as follows: > April 6, 1831, John Norfleet, entered W 1/2, N.W 1/4 Section 23, 80 acres. > June 16, 1831, William Kincaid, entered, 240 acres, Section 24. July 8, > 1831, William H. Brown, entered W 1/3, S.W 1/4. August 2, 1831, Parmenius > Smallwood, entered W 1/2, S.W. 1/4, Section 33, 80 acres. July 17, 1833, > Tyre Harp, entered E 1/2, S.W. 1/4, Section 29, acres. April 21, 1834, > Gabriel Watt, entered N.E 1/4, S.E 1/4, Section 24, 40 Acres. January 3, > 1835, J. Pue, entered S 1/2, S.E. 1/4, Section 36, 80 acres. One of the earliest camp-meeting grounds was on section 25 where Winding Clark held services in 1835. Families came from miles around to enjoy the village of cabins erected here. A platform constructed for the preachers and benches arranged of partially hewn logs helped to offer good cheer and spiritual inspiration. Reverend John St. Clair was present during this time. Jefferson Cross became the first justice of the peace elected to office in the township and Solomon Despain who located in Waynesville in 1830 before locating in Harp Township in 1837 became the first blacksmith to set up shop. Despain was also a Baptist preacher. Despain built his smithy on land owned by William Garrison Wright who had married Tyre Harp's daughter Leah in 1834. A second smithy would later be built near Wilson's mill in 1860 by a man named Leonard. The first road in the township led from Clinton, IL to Marion and was cut by Hugh L. Davenport. By this time the U.S. mail delivered to Clinton where township residents would commute, which was preferable to the longer trip to Bloomington, Illinois to the north. The Gilman branch of the Illinois Central Railroad passes through the township from east to west, entering on section 24, and leaving on section 30. Much litigation surrounded the railroad from people refusing to honor bonds because of non-compliance by the railroad company, one such matter brought by Thomas Snell on section 20 leading to the construction of a switch in the winter of 1882.

The novel has been adapted into two films: Challenge to Lassie and Greyfriars Bobby. Both films starred Donald Crisp. The 1961 Walt Disney film Greyfriars Bobby: The True Story of a Dog was also based on this book. This novel is written from the point-of-view of the dog, Bobby, and uses Scottish dialogue as the novel is set in Edinburgh, Scotland.  Plot  The narration of Greyfriars Bobby is most unusual. The book is written from the mind of a dog, which makes every-day events very strange (a church clock becomes a \\"time-gun\\", for example). The main story of the book is directly adapted from the true Scottish story of Greyfriars Bobby. Bobby spends much time with his master and unofficial owner, \\"Auld Jock\\" (Scots for \\"Old John\\"), creating a very strong emotional connection. They have an intense connection and Jock cares for Bobby very well -- though Jock never bought Bobby. This creates problems later, because of Jock's having, in the eyes of the law, \\"stolen\\" an unlicensed dog. Eventually, Auld Jock dies. Bobby is in great distress; but a loyal dog will never leave its owner's side, even after death. After his owner dies, Bobby is lost; he can barely function without his companion. Though his owner's body was identified by the man's given name, John Gray, and not as \\"Auld Jock\\", his nickname, people still tell Bobby to look for \\"Jock\\", which just worsens Bobby's pain. He is lost for a while, and a large reward is offered for his return. Eventually, Bobby finds Auld Jock's grave and guards it day and night. The pair are inseparable. Characters Bobby Bobby is a Skye terrier from a heathery slope of the Pentland Hills. Auld Jock Auld Jock is Bobby's owner. Jock is Scottish for John, Auld is old so Old John. Mr. John Traill Mr. John Traill is the owner of Ye Olde Greyfriars Dining-Rooms and a landlord. Sergeant Scott Sergeant Scott is an officer of the Royal Engineers. Private McLean Private McLean is Sergeant Scott's private. McLean took care of Scott's belongings. James Brown James Brown (or Mr. Brown) is the curator of the cemetery where Auld Jock was buried. Ailie and Tammy Ailie and Tammy are children from the tenements of Edinburgh. Background This novel is based on the true Scottish story of Greyfriars Bobby. Prior to this 1912 novel, there were many conflicting accounts of the legend, due to inconsistencies being passed down through generations of Scottish families. Eleanor Atkinson's novel served as a standardization and popularization of the story in the United States. Interestingly, Eleanor Atkinson had never stepped foot in Scotland in her life, but wrote extremely detailed depictions of landscapes of Edinburgh and the Borders, implying that she was very familiar with the country through extensive research. Atkinson also very accurately depicts Scottish dialogue, a feat that suggests she wrote the book with the help of Scottish immigrants to the Midwest. The novel was on the market for 17 years, marketed at adults, before an illustrated children's version was released. Atkinson discusses how this is a result of the book being passed down from adults to their children, finding its way into schools' reading lists. She says the book was not written with a young audience in mind, and she credits this lack of simplification for younger audiences with the success of her work.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 571 and it contained 250 housing units. The last settled township in DeWitt County was Nixon. The first settlement began in 1850 and the first to locate in this township was Cicero Twist in the spring of 1850. He settled in Section 8 and that year broke a small patch of prairie and raised a crop of sod corn. There had been land cultivated within its boundaries, years before but by parties living outside the immediate area not citizens of the township. Milo Twist, one of eight, was the first white child born in the township and the Twist family lived in a crude cabin constructed of rough logs just as they were cut from native timber. George, William and Morris Nixon were also some of the most early settlers of the area. They were brothers and came from Ohio in the year 1850, settling in different parts of the township. William Nixon and Smith Fuller of DeWitt Township rode on horseback to Houston, Texas, in 1856 in order to buy 500 sheep each. They drove the one thousand head of sheep back to eastern DeWitt County and were the first farmers in the community to have cattle and sheep grazing on the prairies where Weldon now stands. A.M Pue broke the first prairie sod and raised the first crop of corn. In 1859, at the time of the township organization, the commissioners gave the township the name of Nixon in their honor. John Manlove and a brother-in-law, Hiram Chandler, were also early citizens. C S Lisenby improved land in the early days of the township but resided in Creek Township. A Rush and Kate Shipman were the first couple married in the township. John McGinnis was the first postmaster of Nixon Township. The post office was located and housed in a room of an old house on the farm where Duane Riddle later lived in the 20th century. Grains of corn, wheat and oats were to become the main cash crops and were delivered to market by wagon westerly to Clinton and northeast to Mt. Pleasant (later changed to Farmer City). During the frozen seasons, delivery was made to Decatur by wagon on roads, or sled on the ice of Friends Creek, running in a southerly direction to the Sangamon River, and to the processing plant of A E. Staley Co Grain. Cattle were also hauled and driven overland to Chicago. On one crossroad a store, blacksmith shop and a schoolhouse formed the first settlement of Shoo Fly and was directly northeast of the present village of Weldon. With many bushels of grain and many head of cattle to be marketed, accompanied by a demand for raw materials, a railroad was soon found to be needed. At this time the government entered the picture and gave every sixth mile of land to a division of the Wabash, St Louis & Pacific Railway. This was used to form a railroad called \\"The Peanut Line,\\" which ran from Champaign to Havana, Illinois, a total of 110 miles. The history of this railroad dates from the incorporation of the Monticello Railroad Co. on February 21, 1861. The line from White Heath to Havana, an extension from Monticello to Decatur, was completed by the Havana, Mason City, Lincoln & Eastern Railroad. The village there was named in honor of Lawrence Weldon, a prominent lawyer of Bloomington, Illinois, who was also an attorney for the railroad, and took an active part in determining where the railroad would be built. In 1872 a town of Weldon was laid out adjacent to the railroad, and stores were built one block north of the present main street. This section was destroyed by fire in the summer of 1879 and new stores were built at the present location. The village of Weldon, Illinois, was surveyed and platted by surveyor John Brown, in the spring of 1872. It was placed on record in the fall of 1873, by Colonel Thomas Snell, Charles S. Lisenby, James Alexander and James DeLand. Charles S. Lisenby, rich landowner, sold his land in parts, invested in and helped develop the village of Weldon. The first two-story home was built by Lisenby in 1872. The first church started in 1872, on land donated by Colonel Snell, for that purpose. The first store was built in 1873. The Winslow Brothers operated this store. The first stock consisted of drugs and groceries, but soon merged into a general store. The building was a framed construction, 20 by 60 feet and two stories high. It was located between Water and North Street. It was destroyed by fire in the summer of 1879. The next stores were built on the next block south, which is known as High or Main Street. Grains of corn, wheat and oats were to become the main cash crops and were delivered to market by wagon westerly to Clinton and northeast to Mt. Pleasant (later changed to Farmer City). During the frozen seasons, delivery was made to Decatur by wagon on roads, or sled on the ice of Friends Creek, running in a southerly direction to the Sangamon River, and to the processing plant of A E. Staley Co Grain. Cattle were also hauled and driven overland to Chicago. On one crossroad a store, blacksmith shop and a schoolhouse formed the first settlement of Shoo Fly and was directly northeast of the present village of Weldon. The next several years Weldon was a very progressive little town. It boasted two hotels, two general stores, a grocer, two restaurants, a confectionery, a meat market, a drug store, one millinery shop, operated by Nora Reed (Baker), two barber shops, a lumber and coal yard and three grain elevators. The first blacksmith shop was built in 1873. It was operated by James Paulson. The first hotel was built and operated by John Bennett in 1874. The first postmaster of Weldon was J. C. Coulter, in 1873. The post office was located in the depot. At that time, Weldon's inhabitants numbered about 600. It was one of the most progressive and best conducted villages of its size in the state. C. J. Seaborg was the operator of a wagon and carriage factory, established in 1874. It is said that some of Weldon's first autos were assembled in his shop. There were stockyards in the west part of town, J.H. Scott and Robert Given being two of the early buyers, driving the livestock to town on foot. Mrs. J.T. Thomas owned a loom and in her home she wove many rag carpels, which were sold around Weldon. Mr. George W. Baker sold furniture, farm implements, silverware, jewelry, etc., in his store. Mr. Baker was also the local undertaker. There was also a men's clothing store for many years. A bank was first organized as a private concern by Jacob Swigart in 1887. It was later organized as a state bank in 1906, with Carl Swigart as president, D.M. Smallwood, vice president, H.T. Swigart, cashier, and Charles C. Lisenby, assistant cashier. Weldon was incorporated in 1892. The first meeting of the board of trustees of the village was held in Worship Gray's office, August 15, 1892. T.C. Byland presided, A.M. Drew, C.J. Seaborg, Robert Given and J.H. Scott were the board members, with C.L. Townsend as clerk. On a motion by Dr. Drew, seconded by C.J. Seaborg, a committee was appointed to draft a municipal code for the government of the village of Weldon. Robert Given, T.C. Byland and J.M. Scott were appointed to draft this code. It was voted that the ordinance of Clinton be adopted as much as would pertain to the village of Weldon. The records show that T.C. Byland was paid $15.00 for writing it. Plans were soon made to build many board walks, also a town house, a prison or a calaboose. A calaboose was needed as there were three saloons at this time or soon after. The calaboose was built on a lot belonging to William Gray, purchased by the village for $25.00. Labor to build the building was $23.75. The lumber was hauled from Clinton, with horses.

The highway travels east from an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Paine Field-Lake Stickney through Mill Creek and an intersection with SR 527 to end at SR 9 south of Snohomish. SR 96 was established in 1991 and follows the route of a wagon road constructed by Snohomish County in the late 1880s to connect Snohomish to Seattle. The highway was closed during the Great Coastal Gale of 2007 after a culvert was damaged and its eastern terminus was re-constructed in 2009 to serve increasing volumes of traffic. Route description The eastern terminus of SR 96 south of Snohomish, viewed from SR 9 SR 96 begins as 128th Street at a diamond interchange with I-5 in Paine Field-Lake Stickney, located in suburban Snohomish County south of Everett. The highway travels east and crosses the Interurban Trail and North Creek before turning southeast onto 132nd Street and entering the city of Mill Creek. SR 96 passes north of McCollum Pioneer Park and Henry M. Jackson High School before it intersects SR 527 at a commercial center known as Murphy's Corner. The highway continues east and passes Archbishop Murphy High School before turning northeast onto Seattle Hill Road and ascends the eponymous hill into Silver Firs. SR 96 descends southeast into the Snohomish River valley from Larimers Corner to Rees Corner on 131st Street, ending at an intersection with SR 9 south of Snohomish. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 96 was its western terminus at I-5, serving 43,000 vehicles, while the least busy section is its eastern terminus at SR 9, serving 11,000 vehicles. History Seattle Hill Road and 131st Street have existed since 1885 on their present route as part of a wagon road constructed by Snohomish County connecting Snohomish to Seattle. The highway from Seattle Hill through Mill Creek was completed by the late 1950s and paved in the early 1960s by the county. The road's westernmost segment was previously named \\"Post Road\\" and was extended to Paine Field in the late 1960s, a few years after its interchange with I-5 was opened in 1965. SR 96 was added to the state highway system and codified in 1991, traveling east from I-5 to SR 9 via Mill Creek. Seattle Hill Road was bypassed to the south by Cathcart Way in 2004, planned by the county government since 1978 to redirect traffic on the two-lane SR 96. During the Great Coastal Gale in December 2007, Seattle Hill Road was washed out by a damaged culvert and subsequently closed until late January as WSDOT crews repaired the highway. The eastern terminus of SR 96, an intersection with SR 9, was expanded between April 2008 and December 2009 by WSDOT, adding turning lanes and a traffic camera.

Arrival in Tasmania Dixon arrived in Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) in May 1821 with his brother George. For two years they worked for Edward Lord, tending his cattle station. In 1823 they were each granted 100 acres of land in the valley of the River Clyde and in 1824 each received an additional 200 acres. Sydney In July 1826 Dixon was bought out by his brother and went to Sydney, where he was appointed assistant surveyor in the Surveyor-General's Department under Lieutenant John Oxley. One of his first tasks was to survey the southern districts of New South Wales as far as the Illawarra. The following year he joined Major Thomas Mitchell and Major Edmund Lockyer on a journey to survey the Grose Valley near Mount Victoria. The party was stopped by rough terrain and the men could not continue. In 1827 Dixon attempted to explore and survey the Burragorang Valley. He became lost and almost died. Over the following two years, Dixon made a number of survey trips to the Blue Mountains and in 1829 he tried again to survey the Grose Valley but was unsuccessful. He did, however, obtain a trigonometrical survey of Mount King George and his surveys of the Blue Mountains allowed Mitchell to establish a new road to Bathurst later that year. Goulburn and Southern NSW In 1828 Dixon surveyed the area to the north of what is now the town of Goulburn which at that time was known as the Goulburn Plains. The original township was based on the banks of the Wollondilly River to the south of what is now the Pejar Dam but was moved to its present site in 1833. The area Dixon surveyed has, over subsequent years, been settled and is now part of modern Goulburn North. Dixon continued south and in 1830 he started to survey the area near Queanbeyan by following the Molonglo River to its junction with the Murrumbidgee River. He continued west beyond the area which is now the site of modern Canberra. Dixon was later reprimanded by Mitchell for failing to ascertain Aboriginal place names and a number of the place-names originally proposed by Dixon were later disregarded in favour of names of Aboriginal origin. Northern NSW and return to England In 1831–32 Dixon carried out surveys in the Upper Hunter and New England districts. In October 1833, Dixon was assigned to survey the mountain ranges between the Lachlan River and the Macquarie River. Rather than follow specific instructions, Dixon followed the then-unexplored Bogan River for 108 kilometres and later returned to Bathurst without having surveyed the ranges in the original brief. In 1836 he applied for two years leave to go to England on 'urgent private business'. He departed from Sydney to London on the Abel Gower in July 1836. In 1837, while in London, he published a map of Australia that he had created by compiling official surveys and documents. When he returned to Sydney in July 1838 he was subsequently refused reinstatement by Mitchell. Moreton Bay Dixon's Trigonometrical Survey of the Country at Moreton Bay, 1840 alt= Having failed to gain reinstatement, Dixon moved to Moreton Bay. On 24 July 1839 he married Margaret Sibly, the daughter of James and Elizabeth Sibly of St Neot in Cornwall. During that year, Dixon, with assistant surveyors Granville Stapylton and James Warner, began a trigonometrical survey of Moreton Bay for the Government to facilitate free settlement. A baseline of was measured on Normanby Plains (today's Harrisville, south of Ipswich) as a foundation for the triangulation. Dixon was instructed to compile a plan of the district for land sales and town reserves. In January 1840, Dixon was promoted to surveyor in charge of the Moreton Bay district, but was suspended after an altercation with Lieutenant Owen Gorman, commandant of the Moreton Bay penal settlement (now Brisbane). Dixon's convict servant was arrested and Dixon's response saw him charged with attempting to incite a mutiny. Dixon denied the charges and lodged counter- charges of improper conduct against the Lieutenant. The Lieutenant was later relieved of his appointment as magistrate and the charges against Dixon were not progressed. Dixon, however, was not reinstated. He had again offended the Government by publishing his own map of Moreton Bay in 1841 without permission. This angered Governor Sir George Gipps, resulting in Dixon's disgrace and his replacement by James Warner. When Moreton Bay was opened to free settlement in 1842, Dixon applied for the lease over a number of government buildings. When this was refused, he moved to Toongabbie. Dixon found little available work and returned to England in 1846. He returned to Australia in 1852, spuriously claiming that he had been hired to manage a gold mine. Death Dixon died, at age 58, on 8 April 1858 in Sydney. He was survived by his wife and three of their six children. Historical contribution Dixon is credited with having first surveyed and named a number of areas along the East Coast of Australia including: *Cronulla, New South Wales – the named based on the Aboriginal word kurranulla. *Gunnamatta Bay, New South Wales. *The Oaks, New South Wales – and surrounding areas. *Otford, New South Wales – originally named Bulgo by Dixon. *Russell Island, Queensland. *Wellington Point, Queensland.  Legacy  Dixon, Stapylton and Warner are commemorated on a plaque at the Land Centre, Woolloongabba in Brisbane (). The plaque was placed by the Queensland Division of the Australian Institute of Surveyors and unveiled on 7 May 1989 by the Surveyor- General of Queensland K. J. Davies and the Surveyor-General of New South Wales D. M. Grant.

He collaborated in various reviews and Portuguese and Cape Verdean journals. The publication of his poetry anthology Arquipélago (Archipelago) in 1935 marked the beginning of Cape Verdean poetry. He was, along with Baltazar Lopes da Silva and Manuel Lopes, one of the three founders of the literary journal Claridade (\\"Clarity\\") in 1936, which marked the beginning of modern Cape Verdean literature.  Biography  Jorge Barbosa Secondary SchoolJorge Barbosa Municipal Library in Espargos in the island of Sal Jorge Barbosa was born in the city of Praia, on the island of Santiago, Portuguese Cape Verde archipelago (then a territory of Portugal). Soon after, he moved to the island of São Vicente, where he spent his early years on — excluding his years of study in Lisbon. He published his first work titled Arquipélago (Archipelago) in 1935 which opened its doors to modern Cape Verdean literature and later demonstrated a complete change in rhetoric and thematic poetry in Cape Verde, it formed one of the elements that led to the creation of the Claridade review a year after the publication of the book. His second work was Ambiente (Ambient) which was also called The Circle in 1941. His third book was a notebook titled Caderno de um Ilhéu published in 1955 which later won the Camilo Pessanha Award. He also published poems include Meio Milémiio, Júbilo (Jubilee), Panfletário (Booklet) and \\"Prelúdio\\" (\\"Prelude\\"). He then lived for many years on the island of Sal, working as a civil servant of the customhouse. He died in Cova da Piedade, in Lisbon, Portugal.

Also a municipal library is named for him in the city of Espargos in the middle of Sal. One of his poems \\"Tchapeu di padja\\" would be made into a song by Simentera in the album Cabo Verde em serenada (2000). A book titled Uma Introdução à Poesia de Jorge Barbosa by Gabriel Mariano was related to his poems.

The story takes the form of a parable concerning the virtues of reconciliation. Plot The story opens with the family of Ivan Shtchevbakoff; a generally harmonious family that does rather well for itself. They were on good terms with their neighbors, the family of Gabriel Chormoi, until one day when a hen that belonged to the Shtchevbakoff family flew into the yard of the Chormoi family and laid several eggs. Later that day, Ivan's daughter-in-law went to retrieve the eggs, but grandmother Chormoi takes offense at being accused of stealing. A huge uproar ensues that embroils every member of each family. Against the advice of the family elders to seek quick reconciliation, the families bring cases against each other in court, and they blame each other for every little mishap that happens to befall them. Every accusation makes the enmity grow, the children learn from the example of their parents, and the feud goes on for six years. The elders urge for the families to forget their differences, but the feud continues. A drunken Gabriel strikes one of Ivan's daughters-in-law, and Ivan eventually sees to it that he is sentenced to flogging. Gabriel is shocked, and he curses his neighbor. The magistrate urges the two to reconcile, but Gabriel refuses. Ivan eventually begins to feel sorry for Gabriel, but he refuses to see his own wrongdoing in the quarrel. Ivan's father urges him to reconcile, and to stop wasting his time and money going to court, and to stop setting a bad example for his family. Ivan still refuses to reconcile. Eventually Gabriel sets Ivan's house on fire. No neighbors will help Ivan save his belongings, and eventually the fire overtakes Gabriel's house as well. Ivan's father is burned in the fire, and, on his deathbed, Ivan's father asks his son whose fault the fire was. Ivan finally realizes that it was his fault, and asks forgiveness from his father and from God. His father urges Ivan never to tell that it was Gabriel that had set the fire, and Ivan agrees. Gabriel and Ivan again became good friends, and their families lived together as their houses were rebuilt. The families then go on to become more prosperous than ever, all for following the elders' advice: to quench a spark before it becomes a fire.

Most of the latter had a maritime setting, often the Pacific Navy during World War II. White was best known for juvenile fiction, though he has proven popular with adults as well. Nearly all his books are out of print; nevertheless, White has a devoted following among baby boomers, many of whom were introduced to him through inexpensive paperbacks available in American schools in the mid-20th century. Schools and schooners Robb White III was born to Episcopal missionaries, Placidia (Bridges) and Robb White, in Baguio, Luzon, in the Philippines.http://www.lib.usm.edu/legacy/degrum/public_html/html/research/findaids/white.htm At the time, White's father was working with the Igorots, though he later became an Army chaplain, and thus the young family—including Robb's brother and two sisters—traveled extensively before settling in Thomasville, Georgia.White, Robb, \\"The Most Unforgettable Character I've Met\\", Reader's Digest Magazine, July 1953, p. 102. On a 1958 episode of the television show This Is Your Life, White's sister said that \\"young Bob was the proverbial minister's son, a rebel against all rules and full of deviltry\\"—as exemplified when the boy rolled eggs off the roof onto a Ladies' Auxiliary meeting on the front lawn. White had no formal education before entering the Episcopal High School in New York City, New York. He later attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, graduated as an ensign in 1931, and then worked briefly as a draftsman and construction engineer for DuPont. In his 1953 memoir, Our Virgin Island, White says that by 1937 he \\"had been halfway round the world and back\\" and \\"sailed a schooner around the Atlantic for six months.\\"White, Robb, Our Virgin Island (New York: Doubleday, 1953), p. 15. During his stint on a Boston-based \\"floating school\\" with only one student, White one night swam ashore from two miles out after the schooner was crippled in a December storm. Their virgin island In 1937, White married Rosalie \\"Rodie\\" Mason. The couple settled in Sea Cows Bay on the island of Tortola, where the insects were so severe that White put his typewriter in a boat and wrote in the middle of the bay each day. The pair spent weeks sailing daily throughout the islands in search of a more suitable home. One afternoon, after landing on what they thought was large and better-known Great Camanoe, White walked off in one direction along the beach and Rodie in the other. Meeting less than half an hour later,White 1953, p. 53. they realized they had landed on a tiny island, Marina Cay, which they quickly purchased for $60. The Whites spent three years on Marina, hacking a cistern out of the rough, rocky land and shipping in enough concrete to build a small, sturdy house. These adventurous years, during which the couple weathered a hurricane, fended off a Nazi skipper, aided Jewish refugees, and survived a surprise visit from White's mother-in- law, are detailed in his memoirs, In Privateer's Bay (1939), Our Virgin Island (1953), and Two on the Isle (1985). White was recalled to military duty when World War II broke out; he flew as a pilot, fought near his birthplace in the Battle of Leyte Gulf (1944), and served on battleships, submarines, and aircraft carriers. He earned eight medals and retired with the rank of lieutenant commander after five years of service. At the same time as White's recall, he and Rodie lost Marina Cay. The British government had never issued them a license to hold the land and now formally refused, stating that White's published writings had misrepresented conditions in the British Virgin Islands. Today, the house Robb and Rodie built serves as the reading lounge for a modest-sized resort on the island. \\"A writer's writer\\" White was determined to be a writer from the age of 13. While working for DuPont, he returned home each day and wrote from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. In 1931, he quit DuPont after selling his first story to The American Boy for $100. \\"A writer's writer, White truly lived his trade\\". He produced numerous articles and stories for The Saturday Evening Post, Reader's Digest, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, and Boys' Life, as well as the United States Naval Institute's Proceedings and various risqué publications; as he told interviewer Tom Weaver, \\"I wrote as a woman for True Stories and got raped in a hayloft about once a month.\\"Weaver, Tom, Science Fiction Stars and Horror Heroes: Interviews with Actors, Directors, Producers and Writers of the 1940s through 1960s (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 1991), p. 425. White also wrote for television, including Men of Annapolis and The Silent Service (both 1957), plus episodes of Perry Mason (1961–1965). In the late 1950s and early 1960s he teamed with horror film director William Castle, best known for gimmicks such as a free \\"ghost viewer\\" and a vibrating electrical device mounted beneath the theater seats.150px White and Castle turned out five films, Macabre, 13 Ghosts, Homicidal, The Tingler, and House on Haunted Hill—the last two featuring Vincent Price. Despite all this, White is best known for his 24 novels. The early Run Masked (1938) was White's only effort at a work of adult-themed literature. Most of his books are adventure stories aimed at younger readers -- including The Lion's Paw (1946), Deathwatch (1972), Up Periscope (1956) (filmed with James Garner in 1959), Flight Deck (1961), Torpedo Run (1962), and The Survivor (1964). The last four of these—and many others—are set in the same Pacific Theater where White served during World War II. Others—Lion's Paw, plus the rarer Sail Away (1948), Three Against the Sea (1940), and Smuggler's Sloop (1937)—feature youthful protagonists working together against the elements. \\"White is on record saying that young people appreciate his work most. He attributed this to their good, decent and courageous nature, exactly the kind of people about whom he enjoyed writing. White confided to Something About the Author that he liked stories that dealt with ordinary people who survived in the face of terrible hardship ... White's work is typically hero-driven, a characteristic that emerges most clearly in Deathwatch, where the protagonist battles not only his human persecutor, but the impersonal harshness of the American desert ... \\"\\"Robb White Papers\\". de Grummond Children's Literature Collection.
