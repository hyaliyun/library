How a Dutch cartoonist became world famous during the First World War (2014). Early life He was born and grew up in Roermond, Netherlands during a period of political and social unrest in the city, which at that time formed the battleground between Catholic clericalism and liberalism. Louis‚Äô father published a weekly journal called De Volksvriend (Friend of the People) and was an influential man in liberal circles. His battle against the establishment set the tone for his son‚Äôs standpoint several decades later, when he fought against the unjust and horrendous occupation of neutral Belgium at the start of the First World War. His mother was of German descent. He was trained ‚Äì and later working ‚Äì as a drawing teacher and made landscapes and children's books covers and illustrations in his free time. In 1906 his life took a decisive turn when he accepted the invitation to draw political cartoons for leading Dutch newspapers, first from 1906 to 1909 for the Algemeen Handelsblad and from 1909 onwards for De Telegraaf. First World War Immediately after the Germans invaded Belgium, Louis Raemaekers became one of their fiercest critics. His message was clear: the Netherlands had to take sides for the Allies and abandon its neutral stance. His graphic cartoons depicted the rule of the German military in Belgium, portrayed the Germans as barbarians and Kaiser Wilhelm II as an ally of Satan. His work was confiscated on several occasions by the Dutch government and he was criticized by many for endangering the Dutch neutrality. The minister of Foreign Affairs John Loudon invited Raemaekers, the owner of De Telegraaf H.M.C. Holdert and the editor- in-chief Kick Schr√∂der under pressure from the German government to a meeting, at which he requested them to avoid ‚Äòanything that tends towards insulting the German Kaiser and the German army‚Äô.The National Archives (The Hague), quoted in De Ranitz, Louis Raemaekers (2014), p. 101. It was not possible to prosecute Raemaekers for as long as the country was not under martial law. But the pressure on him continued, also from Germany: in September 1915 the rumor even started circulating that the German government had offered a reward of 12,000 guilders for Raemaekers, dead or alive, but proof of an official statement has never been found.De Ranitz, Louis Raemaekers (2014), p. 106-107. Louis Raemaekers achieved his greatest successes outside his native country. He left for London in November 1915, where his work was exhibited in the Fine Art Society on Bond Street. It was received with much acclaim. Raemaekers became an instant celebrity and his drawings were the talk of the town: ‚Äòthey formed the subject of pulpit addresses, and during two months, the galleries where they have been exhibited have been thronged to excess. Practically every cartoon has been purchased at considerable prices.‚ÄôFacsimile Reproductions of the War Cartoons of Louis Raemaekers (cat.) London, Fine Art Society, February‚ÄìMarch 1916, p. 2-3. He decided to settle in England and his family followed in early 1916. His leaving the Netherlands for London was a godsend for all concerned. Henceforth, the Dutch government could distance itself from the cartoonist and his work in its diplomatic relations, thus stabilising its position vis-√†-vis Germany, while Raemaekers himself could cease his hopeless campaign to get the Netherlands to abandon its neutral stance. He may also have realised for himself that his aim of persuading his country to take up arms and thus avoid the fate of Belgium was not very realistic.De Ranitz, Louis Raemaekers (2014), p. 13-14. From early 1915 Raemaekers' cartoons had already appeared in British newspapers and magazines. In early 1916 he signed a contract with the Daily Mail and they appeared in this newspaper on a regular basis for the next two years.

Soon after his arrival in London he was contacted by Britain's War Propaganda Bureau Wellington House namely to ensure the mass distribution of his work both in England and elsewhere in support of Allied propaganda. Forty of his most captive cartoons were published in Raemaekers Cartoons, which was immediately translated in eighteen languages and distributed worldwide in neutral countries. This was the beginning of a new phase in his life, one which brought him world renown. Among the Allies and in neutral countries, it was specifically Raemaekers' neutral status that gave him credibility. This was most effectively expressed by his good friend Harry Perry Robinson, journalist from The Times in Raemaekers' album The Great War: a Neutral‚Äôs Indictment (1916): ‚ÄòRaemaekers‚Äô testimony is a testimony of an eye-witness. He saw the pitiable stream of refugees which poured from desolated Belgium across the Dutch frontier; and he heard the tale of the abominations which they had suffered from their own lips. ... His message to the world, therefore, when he began to speak, had all the authority not only of a Neutral who was unbiased, but of a Neutral who knew.‚ÄôLouis Raemaekers, The Great War: a Neutral‚Äôs Indictment (1916), xv-xvi. After the first exhibition in London, many others followed suit, first in the United Kingdom and France, soon afterwards in many countries over the world. Albums, pamphlets, posters, postcards and cigarette cards bearing reproductions of his work soon became also available. His drawings were even recreated as tableaux vivants. The total number of Raemaekers' cartoons distributed in this major propaganda effort increased quickly into the millions.James Murray Allison (Ed.), ‚ÄòThe Thousand Million Cartoons‚Äô in Land & Water Extra. Raemaekers‚Äô Number (21 oktober 1918), p. 4-5. United States From the summer of 1916 onwards efforts were made to distribute Raemaekers' work in the most powerful of the neutral countries, the United States. At the request of Wellington House Raemaekers visited the USA in 1917 to draw attention to his work.The National Archives (London), FO 395/131, Neville Foster to David Lloyd George, London 22 May 1917. The United States had declared war on Germany shortly before, and the Allies hoped that his presence would sway public opinion to their cause. His tour was a triumph. Raemaekers gave lectures and interviews, drew caricatures for the movie cameras, was a popular guest at society functions, and met President Woodrow Wilson and former President Theodore Roosevelt. Soon after his arrival he signed ‚Äì to everyone's surprise ‚Äì a contract with the International News Service, the syndicate of William Randolph Hearst. The Hearst newspapers were viewed as pro-German and had been cut off from all Allied news sources. But Raemaekers' own theory: \\"this is the most important target group because the readers are poisoned daily by tendentious articles\\" proved successful.New York Tribune, 26 August 1917. Statistics show that by October 1917, more than two thousand American newspapers had published Raemaekers‚Äô cartoons in hundreds of millions of copies.The National Archives (London), FO 395/131, Statistics and report September 1917. The popularisation of his work is regarded as the largest propaganda effort of the First World War.James Murray Allison (Ed.), ‚ÄòThe Thousand Million Cartoons‚Äô in Land & Water Extra. Raemaekers‚Äô Number (21 oktober 1918) p. 4. Between the wars Following the end of the First World War, Louis Raemaekers settled in Brussels. He was an advocate of the League of Nations and devoted many sketches and articles to the cause of unity in Europe. Meanwhile, he kept a close and suspicious eye on events in Germany. Interest in his work waned in Britain and France, where his war cartoons were still fresh in the public‚Äôs memory. People had had enough of his depictions of atrocities. A Dutch publisher rejected a collection of his illustrations because ‚Äòthe public is rather weary of war topics‚Äô.Hoover Institution Archives, Louis Raemaekers Papers and Artwork, Correspondence, Letter from Henri Mayer (Martinus Nijhoff) to Raemaekers, The Hague 28 January 1929. In 1927 he created a comic book about TBC named Gezondheid Is De Grootste Schat. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/raemaekers_louis.htm In the thirties, however, people began to think that Raemaekers might be right about Germany. He grew more productive, but the artistic and content-related quality of his work suffered proportionately. He remained loyal to De Telegraaf until well into the thirties, even after the paper‚Äôs management became pro-German. He took the same stance as during the First World War towards the Hearst Press: these readers were his most important target group. Second World War and last years Raemaekers fled to the United States shortly before the start of the Second World War and remained there until 1946, when he returned to Brussels. He had not been forgotten in the Netherlands, but it was only on his eightieth birthday, in 1949, that his native country gave him the recognition that he had long desired: he was made an honorary citizen of the City of Roermond. After an absence of almost forty years, Raemaekers returned to the Netherlands in 1953. He died in Scheveningen near The Hague in 1956. Legacy In the summer of 1956, The Times published the obituary of a man who had enjoyed a worldwide reputation during the First World War: ‚ÄòLouis Raemaekers, the biting anti-German cartoonist of the 1914-18 War, died on July 26, 1956 at Scheveningen, near The Hague, at the age of 87. It has been said of Raemaekers that he was the one private individual who exercised a real and great influence on the course of the 1914-18 War. There were a dozen or so people ‚Äì emperors, kings, statesmen, and commanders-in-chief ‚Äì who obviously, and notoriously, shaped policies and guided events. Outside that circle of the great, Louis Raemaekers stands conspicuous as the one man who, without any assistance of title or office, indubitably swayed the destinies of peoples.‚Äô The Times, 27 July 1956.

First published in Playboy magazine in 1984, the story was subsequently featured in a 1988 short story collection also titled The Toynbee Convector.  Plot summary  Roger Shumway, a reporter, is invited to visit Craig Bennett Stiles, a 130-year-old man also known as the Time Traveler. This is the first interview Stiles has granted since shortly after his return from the future, 100 years previously. Stiles had claimed then that he invented a time machine (which he privately refers to as his Toynbee Convector, although he does not reveal the name of the device to anyone until much later). Stiles used the machine to travel forward in time about a hundred years from what was an economically and creatively stagnant society (about 1984). On returning to that present, he showed evidence ‚Äî films and other records collected on his journey ‚Äî showing that humanity developed an advanced civilization with many marvelous and helpful inventions, and a restored natural environment. He also claimed to have then destroyed the machine deliberately to prevent anyone else doing the same. Initially, people were skeptical of the Traveler's claims, but they are unable to explain or disprove the authenticity of the records brought from the future. Inspired by the prospect of a utopian future, many people began projects to fulfill the vision and create the world the Traveler claims to have seen. A hundred years later, the perfect world of Stiles' visions has come to pass, just as he saw in his time travel. Now 130 years old, Stiles recounts the story to Shumway. Stiles calmly reveals what really happened, simply stating, \\"I lied.\\" Since he knew the people of the world had it in them to create a utopia, he created the illusion of one, to give humanity a goal, and hope. Because of people's belief in the illusion, the imagined utopian future became reality. After explaining his actions, Stiles presents Shumway with the evidence of his fraud on several recorded tapes and cassettes. Stiles then steps into a machine of his own creation, which he calls \\"a real time machine\\". Turning the machine on, electricity pulses through it and Stiles' body, taking his life. Shumway is then left with the decision to either reveal Stiles' deception to the world or destroy the evidence, thus perpetuating Stiles' utopian lies. Turning the machine on once again, in order to destroy it, Shumway quietly drops the evidence into an incinerator set into the wall nearby and exits Stiles' home via a glass elevator. Origin of title Within the story, Stiles says that he chose the name \\"Toynbee Convector\\" for his machine, being inspired by \\"a historian named Toynbee\\": > ... that fine historian who said any group, any race, any world that did not > run to seize the future and shape it was doomed to dust away to the grave, > in the past. Bradbury almost certainly refers to Arnold J. Toynbee, who proposed that civilisation must respond to a challenge in order to flourish. Adaptations The story was made into an episode of The Ray Bradbury Theater starring James Whitmore (as Stiles) and Michael Hurst (as Roger Shumway). It was first broadcast in 1990.

Background Lennie Peters (AKA Gary Hall) (born Leonard George Sargent, 22 November 1931, London), an uncle of Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, was blinded in one eye during a car accident when he was five years old. A thrown brick blinded his other eye when he was sixteen. Before Peters and Lee, he was a pianist playing the London pub scene. He recorded two singles on the Oriole label, \\"Let the Tears Begin\\" and \\"And My Heart Cried\\" in 1963 and 1964 respectively. In 1966 he recorded \\"Stranger in Paradise\\" for Pye Records and then \\"Here We Go Again\\" on the Gemini label in 1970. The latter he would revisit as Peters and Lee in 1976. He teamed up with actress and dancer Dianne Lee (born Dianne Littlehales, February 1949, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England) in 1970. Lee would provide backing vocals for Peters' solo act. She was also at the time part of a dance act with her cousin Liz. Their original act was called Lennie Peters and Melody until their management International Artists suggested the name Peters and Lee. Their first performance was with Rolf Harris on 30 April 1970 at a concert in Bournemouth. Early success They entered the TV talent show Opportunity Knocks, which they won for a then-record seven times, with such songs as \\"All Change Places\\", \\"I'm Confessin'\\", \\"Let It Be Me\\" and \\"All I Ever Need is You\\". Following their TV success, a record contract was soon signed with Philips Records. They were produced by Philips' A&R; man Johnny Franz, and their management company was International Artists, run by showbiz professionals Phyllis Rounce and Laurie Mansfield. Franz found the song that suited them well, and their recording quickly led to a number one hit; \\"Welcome Home\\" sold over 800,000 copies in Britain. A successful first album, We Can Make It, followed, which also reached the number one position, selling over 250,000 copies. Further single hits followed with \\"Don't Stay Away Too Long\\" and \\"Hey Mr Music Man\\". TV appearances The duo was top of the bill at the Royal Variety Performance in 1973. They were also resident guest stars on The Des O'Connor Show, had slots on The Golden Shot, Mike and Bernie Winters' Show, Presenting Nana Mouskouri, Seaside Special and David Nixon's show. Peters and Lee had a popular TV series of their own Meet Peters & Lee, including several Christmas specials made by ATV. \\"The Peters and Lee Story\\" was one Christmas special made for 27 December 1975 which starred Mike and Bernie Winters, Cleo Laine and Aiden J Harvey who won New Faces in 1974. Their success made them household names and frequent appearances on Top of the Pops also kept their record sales steady. Their last TV appearance before their split was London Night Out in November 1980 in which they performed four songs from their farewell album. Solo and reunion Lee went on to perform mainly in theatre and acting roles, whilst Peters pursued a solo singing career. He recorded his only solo album Unforgettable in 1981 and released three singles, \\"Record of My Love\\" in 1981, \\"Why Me\\" for Christmas 1982 and \\"Key Largo\\" in 1985. Peters also appeared on a few small TV slots and appeared briefly as a crime boss in the 1984 film The Hit, but without a huge success. Despite their fame, neither Peters nor Lee could repeat the success they enjoyed whilst together. The pair reunited in 1986 with a new single, \\"Familiar Feelings\\", to perform on the nostalgia circuit. They also made some TV appearances, performing their new single. The duo went on to record two new albums, one in 1989 and the last in 1992 for their 21st anniversary, before Peters' death from bone cancer in 1992, aged 60. Their final TV appearance was Pebble Mill in February 1992 with a short interview and a performance of the hit \\"Hey Mister Music Man\\". Sporting a broken arm, Peters' illness was apparent.

He was replaced in 1975 when the Athletics acquired a baserunning specialist who was also a position player. Washington returned to professional track, then became the owner/operator of numerous McDonald's restaurants and a minor league professional hockey franchise. He held a number of executive posts on varied boards and organizations. Early life Washington was born in Belzoni, Mississippi, and his family moved to Flint, Michigan, when Washington was an infant. His parents worked in the automotive industry. Washington attended Flint Northern High School until 10th grade, when it was discovered that he lived outside of the school's boundaries. Losing a semester of athletic eligibility, Washington was forced to finish at the rival school, Flint Central High School. There he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.4 seconds, attracting numerous college scholarship offers. Washington chose Michigan State University because he knew that there were a number of black athletes at the school. At Michigan State, the four- time all-American won one National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title, won seven Big Ten titles, and tied or broke the world record in the 50- and 60-yard dashes several times. Track career During the 1972 indoor season, he tied Kirk Clayton's two-year-old hand timed world record in the 50 yard dash of 5.0 at a meet in Toronto, which Mel Pender also tied twice a month later. The following week, he set the 60-yard dash record outright, stopping the clock at 5.8 at a home meet in East Lansing. Neither record has been surpassed as of 2019, as races run in yards are rare, with records for these having been discontinued in 1976, and hand times ceased to be accepted from 1977. A few years later, Washington said that his biggest disappointment had been not qualifying for the 1972 Summer Olympics. Washington was on the cover of the February 1972 issue of Track and Field News.Past Covers 1972. Trackandfieldnews.com. Retrieved on September 4, 2017. In 1973, Washington again tied the 50-yard record at the same meet in Toronto. Later that summer, Washington won the international Pacific Conference Games 100 metres also in Toronto. Pro baseball career In 1974, Washington was tapped by Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley to become the team's \\"designated runner\\". Finley and Washington worked out a one-year $45,000 contract with a $20,000 signing bonus. The contract had an unusual clause requiring Washington to grow facial hair before the beginning of the season. Washington had difficulty growing a full mustache, so he used an eyebrow pencil to simulate full facial hair. Despite having no professional baseball experience, and having last played baseball in high school, Washington was a member of the Athletics 1974 World Series championship team. Finley announced that he would utilize Washington as a \\"designated runner\\" and that he did not expect Washington to develop other baseball skills. Washington received coaching on baserunning from Maury Wills. Though Washington's teammates recognized his speed, he received a mixed reception from them because of his unusual background. Reggie Jackson said, \\"He's a great athlete, but he's not a baseball player.\\" Pitcher Rollie Fingers said that he thought the idea was \\"a little crazy\\" but that Washington \\"could run like crazy\\". Bert Campaneris said that the team could count on Washington to steal a base when needed. Before the 1974 World Series, team captain Sal Bando said that he did not think Washington should be used in the World Series, noting that Washington might not have a second chance to make up for any mistakes committed during the series. Appearing as a pinch-runner for Joe Rudi in game two of the World Series, Washington was picked off first base in a crucial ninth-inning situation by Dodgers reliever Mike Marshall. Early in the 1975 season, Washington was released. Before the season, the Athletics had acquired Don Hopkins, a pinchrunning specialist who could also play in the outfield. The Athletics had also acquired a second pinchrunning specialist, Matt Alexander, just before Washington's release. Washington played in 105 MLB games without batting, pitching, or fielding, playing exclusively as a pinch runner. He had 31 stolen bases in 48 attempts and scored 33 runs during his short career. Washington is one of only seven players to have more game appearances than plate appearances, presumably excluding starting pitchers who played primarily for the American League, and relief pitchers. Washington's 1975 Topps baseball card is the only baseball card ever released that uses the \\"pinch runner\\" position label. Business career Following his 13-month stint as the only \\"designated runner\\" in MLB history, Washington joined the professional track and field circuit and remained in competition until 1976. He worked for Michigan Bell as an assistant director of personnel. In 1980, he moved from the Detroit area to Rochester, New York, where he opened an inner- city McDonald's restaurant. He added his second local McDonald's franchise seven months later, and in 1986 he opened a McDonald's in suburban Pittsford, New York. He acquired a total of five Rochester-area McDonald's franchises. Washington's restaurant enterprise, HLW Fast Track Inc., owned 21 McDonald's franchises in Ohio and Pennsylvania by 2009; at that time, it was the largest McDonald's franchisee owned by an African American. Washington was co-chairman of the Small Business Committee of the United Way, and was active in the Urban League of Rochester. Washington was named to the New York State Athletic Commission in 1990. In 1992, he became the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Buffalo, New York, branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and later was named Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In 2005, he founded the Youngstown SteelHounds minor league hockey franchise in the Central Hockey League (CHL). The SteelHounds were removed from the CHL in 2008 for non-payment of league dues. Washington said that he had paid the league's expansion team fees but that he owed some money, which he was withholding because the league did not reimburse him for some travel expenses. The International Hockey League (IHL) expressed some interest in picking up the Youngstown team, but the league dropped the idea after no serious meetings were held between the team and the IHL. Personal Washington's son Terrell ran track for Michigan State. As of 2012, Terrell was the general manager of his father's McDonald's franchising company.

It is usually used when a person goes to sleep or is otherwise at rest. It traps radiant bodily heat that otherwise would be lost through convection, helping to keep the user warm. Many children and adults utilize a blanket as a comfort object.  Etymology  The term arose from the generalization of a specific fabric called Blanket fabric, a heavily napped woolen weave pioneered by Thomas Blanket (Blanquette), a Flemish weaver who lived in Bristol, England, in the 14th century. Earlier usage of the term is possible through its derivation from the French word for white, blanc. Types Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe, (right section) by Claude Monet Blanket vendors on a market in Algeria Many types of blanket material, such as wool, are used because they are thicker and have more substantial fabric to them, but cotton can also be used for light blankets. Wool blankets are warmer and also relatively slow to burn compared to cotton. The most common types of blankets are woven acrylic, knitted polyester, mink, cotton, fleece and wool. Blankets also come with exotic crafting and exotic material such as crocheted afghan or a silk covering. The term blanket is often interchanged with comforter, quilt, and duvet, as they all have similar uses.  Uses Blankets have been used by militaries for many centuries. Militaries are some of the biggest single consumers of woolen blankets. Military blankets tend to be coarse grey, with thick fibers of over 20 microns. Suppliers include J. E. Ashworth & Sons and Faribault Woolen Mills, who made half of all blankets in America at one time. Special blankets known as baby blankets are used to protect infants from the cold. Small children (and some adults) may also use a blanket as a comfort object. Blankets may be spread on the ground for a picnic or where people want to sit in a grassy or muddy area without soiling their clothing. Temporary blankets have been designed for this purpose.

Life  A member of the Carbones of the plebeian gens Papiria, and nephew of Gaius Papirius Carbo (consul for 120 BC), he was a strong supporter of the Marian faction, and took part in the blockade of Rome (87 BC). In 85 BC he was chosen by Lucius Cornelius Cinna as his colleague in the consulship, and extensive preparations were made for carrying out war in Greece against Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had announced his intention of returning to Italy. Cinna and Carbo declared themselves consuls for the following year, and large bodies of troops were transported across the Adriatic Sea; but when Cinna was murdered by his own soldiers after a major shipwreck, Carbo was obliged to bring them back. He spent most of 84 BC bolstering his forces in Italy. Convincing the Italians that Sulla would reverse their citizenship and voting rights, it was not difficult for Carbo to raise forces. The urban plebs, moreover, feared of Sulla's response to a second civil war after hearing of Sulla's vicious sacks of Greek cities. He orchestrated the election of his successors, Scipio Asiaticus and Gaius Norbanus to the consulship for 83 BC and assumed the proconsulship of the nearby province of Cisalpine Gaul. Shortly thereafter, he induced the Senate to deliver a declaring Sulla an enemy of the state and giving the consuls, Asiaticus and Norbanus, the province of Italy. When Sulla returned from the east in the spring of 83 BC, he defeated Norbanus at the Battle of Mount Tifata, forcing his army to flee to Capua, and induced large defections from Asiaticus' army. Sulla captured Asiaticus, set him free to show his benevolence, and Norbanus extricated himself from Capua. In response to these setbacks, Carbo marched south from Cisalpine Gaul, but the Marian-allied forces were unable to mount an effective defence against Sulla and his allies. Carbo induced the Assembly to elect him and Gaius Marius the Younger to the consulship for 82 BC. Carbo went north to Etruria to fight Sulla's allies Metellus and Pompey, while Marius the Younger marched on Sulla himself. Marius marched his army south-east into Campania and met Sulla's forces at Scariportus (near Signia). The Battle of Scariportus ended with Marius' army being routed (Marius lost 28,000 men; they were either killed, captured, turned coat or fled. Sulla claimed to have only lost 23 men). Marius survived the battle and with 7,000 men he retreated to Praeneste.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp 170-172; Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 138-139; Appian, The Civil Wars, 1,87. Although he still had a large army and the Samnites remained faithful to him, Carbo saw that Sulla had won the balance of the conflict. Unable to relieve Praeneste he decided to leave Italy, ostensibly to raise forces in Africa, but never made it farther than Sicily. In 81 BC Sulla sent Pompey to Sicily with a large force (six legions, 120 warships and 800 transport ships). Carbo was soon discovered and arrested by Pompey, who \\"treated Carbo in his misfortunes with an unnatural insolence\\", taking Carbo in fetters to a tribunal he presided over, examining him closely \\"to the distress and vexation of the audience\\", and finally, sentencing him to death.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp 28-29; Plutarch, The Life of Pompey, 10.3. Although most notable for his role in the chaotic 80s, Carbo had also made a name for himself prior to that period, particularly during his tenure as Tribune of the Plebs in 92 BC.T. Robert S. Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic Vol. 2, p.18 Under his supervision, and with his apparent encouragement, a meeting of the people broke down into disorder. The event was considered significant enough by the Senate to warrant a decree, championed by Lucius Licinius Crassus, placing responsibility for public disorder with the presiding officer; this decree was apparently still active forty years later in the time of CiceroCicero, De Legibus 3.42 As with several of the notable politicians of the 90s and 80s BC, such as Publius Sulpicius, Marcus Antonius the Orator, and Lucius Crassus, Carbo had a reputation for effective oratory. For instance, Cicero writes of one occasion when Carbo made use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double trochee ‚Äì u ‚Äì x), which was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.Cicero, Orator 214  Sources  * Details a broad narrative history from the death of the Gracchi brothers to the dictatorship of Sulla.

The term \\"referral\\" means \\"the request by a physician for the item or service\\" for Medicare Part B services and \\"the request or establishment of a plan of care by a physician which includes the provision of the designated health service\\" for all other services. DHS includes \\"clinical laboratory services\\"; \\"physical therapy services\\"; \\"occupational therapy services\\"; \\"radiology services, including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services\\"; \\"radiation therapy services and supplies\\"; \\"durable medical equipment and supplies\\"; \\"parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies\\"; \\"prosthetics, orthotics, and prosthetic devices and supplies\\"; \\"home health services\\"; \\"outpatient prescription drugs\\"; \\"inpatient and outpatient hospital services\\"; and \\"outpatient speech-language pathology services.\\" A \\"financial relationship\\" includes ownership, investment interest, and compensation arrangements. Stark Law contains several exceptions, including physician services, in-office ancillary services, ownership in publicly traded securities and mutual funds, rental of office space and equipment, and bona fide employment relationship. It is named for United States Congressman Pete Stark (D-CA) who sponsored the initial bill.  History  In 1988, Stark introduced an \\"Ethics in Patient Referrals Act\\" bill concerning physician self-referrals. Some of the ideas in the bill became law as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. In specific, what is referred to as \\"Stark I\\" prohibited a physician referring a Medicare patient to a clinical laboratory if the physician or his/her family member has a financial interest in that laboratory. It was codified in the United States Code, Title 42, Section 1395nn (42 U.S.C. 1395nn, \\"Limitation on certain physician referrals\\"). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 contained what is known as \\"Stark II\\" amendments to the original law. \\"Stark II\\" extended the \\"Stark I\\" provisions to Medicaid patients and to DHS other than clinical laboratory services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued rules in the Federal Register to implement Stark Law, including a 2001 \\"Phase I\\" final rule, a 2004 \\"Phase II\\" interim final rule, and a 2007 \\"Phase III\\" final rule. Penalties Penalties for violations of Stark Law include: denial of payment for the DHS provided; refund of monies received by physicians and facilities for amounts collected; payment of civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each service that a person \\"knows or should know\\" was provided in violation of the law, and three times the amount of improper payment the entity received from the Medicare program; exclusion from the Medicare program and/or state healthcare programs including Medicaid; and payment of civil penalties for attempting to circumvent the law of up to $100,000 for each circumvention scheme.  Physician self-referral  Physician self-referral is the practice of a physician referring a patient to a medical facility in which the physician has a financial interest, be it ownership, investment, or a structured compensation arrangement. Critics argue that this practice is an inherent conflict of interest, because the physician benefits from the physician's own referral. They suggest that such arrangements may encourage overutilization of services, in turn driving up health care costs. In addition, they believe that it would create a captive referral system, which limits competition by other providers. Those who defend the practice contend that these problems are not widespread. They argue that physicians who own, invest in, or operate medical facilities are responding to a need for medical services which would otherwise not be met, particularly in medically under-served areas. In addition, it is often the case that physician owned entities present a lower-cost alternative to the facilities that are located at hospitals. This is due mostly to higher overhead costs that hospitals must pass down to their services. Enforcement Multiple federal entities oversee enforcement of Stark Law. These include the Department of Justice, CMS, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In recent years, enforcement of Stark Law has become increasingly aggressive, largely as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its amendments to the False Claims Act. 2014 saw some of the largest Stark Law violation settlements to date. On June 9, 2015, the Office of Inspector General issued a fraud alert targeting physician compensation arrangements with hospitals and health systems. Risk abatement Contracts between physicians and hospitals must fit within the seven safe harbors for Stark Law in order to fully alleviate violation risk: the contract's duration must be at least a year; in writing and signed by both parties; specify aggregate payment which is set in advance; payment is reasonable and fair market value; payment must not relate to volume or value of business; the exact services to be performed must be outlined; and be commercially reasonable. Because current processes for monitoring contract compliance and logging physician work hours are often done on paper, the majority of Stark Law violation settlements are the result of technical violations. Healthcare experts agree that information technology is necessary to streamline hospital processes, including those relating to compliance and Stark Law. Certain electronic health record companies help healthcare systems collect, organize, and store data. Multiple technology solutions exist that specifically automate physician time logging and eliminates Stark Law violation risk.  Reform proposal  The Stark law may impede certain pay for performance value-based arrangements, which led to discussions around reform as of 2019.

The term originates from alcoholism. The person works at the cost of their sleep, meeting friends or family. While the term generally implies that the person enjoys their work, it can also alternately imply that they simply feel compelled to do it. There is no generally accepted medical definition of such a condition, although some forms of stress, impulse control disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder can be work-related. Etymology The word itself is a portmanteau word composed of work and alcoholic. Its first known appearance, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, came in Canada in the Toronto Daily Star of 5 April 1947, page 6, with a punning allusion to Alcoholics Anonymous:  Details  The term workaholic refers to various types of behavioral patterns, with each having its own valuation. For instance, workaholism is sometimes used by people wishing to express their devotion to one's career in positive terms. The \\"work\\" in question is usually associated with a paying job, but it may also refer to independent pursuits such as sports, music, art, and science. However, the term is more often used to refer to a negative behavioral pattern that is popularly characterized by spending an excessive amount of time on working, an inner compulsion to work hard and a neglect of family and other social relations. Researchers have found that in many cases, incessant work-related activity continues even after impacting the subject's relationships and physical health. Causes of it are thought to be anxiety, low self-esteem, and intimacy problems. Furthermore, workaholics tend to have an inability to delegate work tasks to others and tend to obtain high scores on personality traits such as neuroticism, perfectionism, and conscientiousness. Clinical psychologist Bryan E. Robinson identifies two axes for workaholics: work initiation and work completion. He associates the behavior of procrastination with both \\"Savoring Workaholics\\" (those with low work initiation/low work completion) and \\"Attention-Deficit Workaholics\\" (those with high work initiation and low work completion), in contrast to \\"Bulimic\\" and \\"Relentless\\" workaholics - both of whom have high work completion. Workaholism in Japan is considered a serious social problem leading to early death, often on the job, a phenomenon dubbed kar≈çshi. Overwork was popularly blamed for the fatal stroke of Prime Minister of Japan Keiz≈ç Obuchi, in the year 2000. Death from overwork is not a uniquely Japanese phenomenon; in 2013, a Bank of America intern in London died after working for 72 hours straight. Workaholics tend to be less effective than other workers because they have difficulty working as part of a team, trouble delegating or entrusting co-workers or organizational problems due to taking on too much work at once. Moreover, workaholics often suffer sleep deprivation, which results in impaired brain and cognitive function. The business risk that workaholism presents is an underestimated risk in companies and human resources management, which can develop into an existential threat to a business.

Career He was associated with Gaius Gracchus in carrying out the provision of the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus. When tribune of the people (131 BC), Carbo carried out a law extending the secret ballot for the enactment and repeal of laws. He also proposed that the tribunes should be allowed to become candidates for the same office in successive years. The proposal was defeated by Scipio Aemilianus. Carbo was suspected of having been involved in the sudden death of Scipio Aemilianus in 129 BC. He subsequently went over to the optimates, and (when consul in 120 BC) successfully defended Lucius Opimius, the murderer of Gaius Gracchus. He was impeached for the murder of a citizen without a trial (Gaius Gracchus). At trial, he said that Gracchus had been justly slain. But the optimates did not trust Carbo. He was impeached by Lucius Crassus on a similar charge, and, feeling that he had nothing to hope for from the optimates and that his condemnation was certain, he committed suicide.See Livy, Epit. 59; Appian, Bell.

Crassus found out about Carbo's intentions and decided, much to the surprise of later commentators, to incorporate Carbo into his close circle of advisors. As a result, 'the keen and bitter Carbo got nothing from his trip to Gaul, except the realization that his father had been guilty and had been sent into exile by a man of complete integrity' (Valerius Maximus, 3.7.6).

Davis (July 19, 1873 ‚Äì August 11, 1947) was a Major League Baseball first baseman who played for the New York Giants (1895‚Äì96), Pittsburgh Pirates (1896‚Äì98), Louisville Colonels (1898), Washington Senators (1898‚Äì99), Philadelphia Athletics (1901‚Äì11, 1913‚Äì17), and Cleveland Naps (1912). Early life Athletics, circa 1911 Davis was born in Philadelphia. He had no middle name, but he added the middle initial H to distinguish himself from others who shared his first and last names. He attended Girard College; the institution served as an elementary school and high school. Davis, who picked up the lifelong nickname of \\"Jasper\\" at Girard, graduated in 1891 and played amateur baseball until beginning his professional baseball career in 1894. Career After having played the 1900 for the minor league Providence Grays, he decided to quit baseball, but Athletics manager Connie Mack made him an offer too large to refuse to return to baseball in 1901 with the Athletics. He led the American League in home runs from 1904 to 1907, one of only five players to have ever led their league for four consecutive seasons. He also hit for the cycle on July 10, 1901. He led the AL in doubles three times and the NL in triples once. Davis was the starting first baseman and first captain of manager Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics from 1901 to 1910. In 1905 he led the American league in home runs, RBI, runs and doubles, and led the Athletics to the 1905 World Series against the New York Giants. He was the starting first baseman for the 1910 World Champions and hit .353 in the 1910 World Series. In 1911, the 37-year-old Davis was replaced at first base by the younger Stuffy McInnis, and Davis played a reserve role for the 1911 World Champions. Davis managed the 1912 Cleveland Naps, but left with 28 games left in the season and a record of 54‚Äì71. He returned to the Athletics as a player, coach and assistant captain in 1913, amassing only 33 plate appearances over the next five seasons combined. In 1755 games over 22 seasons, Davis posted a .277 batting average (1841-for-6653) with 1001 runs, 361 doubles, 145 triples, 75 home runs, 951 RBI, 285 stolen bases, 525 bases on balls, .335 on-base percentage and .408 slugging percentage. He finished his career with an overall .978 fielding percentage primarily as a first baseman. In 16 World Series games (1905,'10,'11) he batted .246 (15-for-61) with 8 runs, 5 doubles, 7 RBI and 3 walks. Later life He continued as a coach and scout with Mack's Athletics until 1927 and also served as a Philadelphia City Councilman. Davis died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, August 11, 1947, at the age of 74.

It was equivalent to a master's degree in present-day nomenclature but the title diploma was retained for historic reasons, \\"diploma\\" being the archaic term for a master's degree. The Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government (EPSRC) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. History The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a University of Cambridge Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the \\"demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing ‚Ä¶ [which] if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered\\". The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory \\"was one of the pioneers in the de and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)\\". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that \\"The Summer School deals [only] with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed.\\" The Diploma \\"would include theoretical and practical work ‚Ä¶ [and also] instruction about the various types of computing-machine ‚Ä¶ and the principles of design on which they are based.\\" With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.Informal history of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory University-supported teaching and research staff in the Laboratory at the time were Maurice Wilkes (head of the laboratory), J. C. P. Miller, W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove. In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year (\\"Part IB\\") of the undergraduate Computer Science Tripos course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate (\\"Part II\\") lecture courses also included. There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.

Bra»ôov) or Romanian Aeronautic Industry in English, is a Romanian aerospace manufacturer.Industria Aeronautica Romana IAR 80 & 81 at century-of-flight.net It is based in Ghimbav, near Bra»ôov, Romania. IAR was founded in 1925 with the aid of the Romanian government, which sought to reduce reliance on foreign companies to supply the Royal Romanian Air Force with aircraft and associated equipment. In addition to its own designs, the company built numerous foreign-designed aircraft under license as well. IAR produced a low-wing all-metal monoplane, the IAR 80, during the Second World War; this combat aircraft was extensively used by the nation during the conflict. During the Cold War era, the company branched out into helicopters, securing licensing agreements with France for their designs in the field, leading to the IAR 316 and IAR 330. During 2000, IAR partnered with the multinational helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter Group to create the Eurocopter Romania joint venture company. Presently, the company employs around 1,200 specialists including more than 170 engineers; it carries out upgrades, revisions, and overhauls on helicopters and light aircraft.Romania-Aviation Industry History =Origins and early years= To ensure that the Royal Romanian Air Force (the Aeronautica RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, or ARR) would be supplied with aircraft without reliance on foreign producers, the Romanian government subsidized the creation of three major aircraft manufacturers in the interbellum period. The first was Societatea pentru ExploatƒÉri Tehnice (SET) which was founded in Bucharest in 1923. Next came IAR, which was formed in Bra»ôov since 1925. Finally there was √éntreprinderea de Construc»õii Aeronautice Rom√¢ne»ôti (ICAR), which was created in Bucharest in 1932, and operated a factory in Bra»ôov known as ICA-Bra»ôov (√éntreprinderea de Construc»õii Aeronautice - Bra»ôov). One of the engineers designing IAR aircraft in the early 1930s was Elie Carafoli. During 1930, IAR's first original aircraft, the IAR CV 11, performed its maiden flight; it functioned as an experimental design only. One of its earliest aircraft to reach quantity production was the IAR 14, a trainer aircraft derived from the IAR 12 prototype. The IAR 27 was a more advanced trainer that was introduced in larger quantities during the late 1930s. In addition to pursuing its own designs, IAR also pursued work via the licensed production of foreign- developed aircraft. Poland's innovative PZL P.11 fighter captured the attention of Romanian officials, leading to a batch of 95 aircraft, referred to as the P.11f, being built by IAR starting in 1936.Morga≈Ça 1997, p. 63. The Romanian Air Force was greatly appreciative of the type, which heavily contributed to the decision to also licensed produce its upgraded derivative, the PZL P.24, which had been designed exclusively for the export market. Both models would see combat service during the Second World War.Cynk 1967, p. 7. IAR worked throughout the conflict to produce large numbers of combat aircraft to equip the Romanian military. Perhaps one of the most significant aircraft to be produced by the company was built during these years in the form of the IAR 80, a low-wing monoplane all-metal monocoque fighter and ground-attack aircraft. When it first flew in 1939, the IAR 80 was claimed to be comparable to contemporary designs being deployed by the most advanced military powers, including the British Hawker Hurricane and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E. An improved model, the IAR 81 fighter aircraft, was designed and produced mid- way through the war as well. The type remained in frontline use until May 1945, when the conflict was brought to an end.Antoniu and Cicos 2000, pp. 239‚Äì248. =Cold War era= Between 1945 and 1947, under the coordination of Radu Manicatide and Radu MƒÉrdƒÉrescu, IAR developed a microcar, named M.R., and an automobile. However, the company did not persist with road vehicle development in the long term.From the history of the automobile During this era, IAR begun to produce helicopters. Romania arranged multiple licensing agreements with France, resulting in IRA producing A√©rospatiale's SA 316B Alouette III under the local designation of IAR 316. The company also manufactured a localised version of the A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma, designated IAR 330.Marnix Sap, Carlo Brummer: Fortele Aeriene Romane in: Lotnictwo Nr. 4/2010, pp. 40‚Äì41 These rotorcraft were not only manufactured for domestic consumption, such as the Romanian Air Force, but also for the global market; roughly one-third of all IAR 330s were reportedly sold to export customers.IISS Military Balance 2010 During the late 1980s, a Soviet-Romanian partnership led to the development of the Kamov Ka-126 helicopter; only a handful were built before production was terminated shortly following the Romanian Revolution and the collapse of the Communist government.Lambert, Mark. Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1993‚Äì94. Coulsdon, UK: Jane's Data Division, 1993. pp. 277‚Äì278. . Between 1968 and 2000, IAR has produced more than 370 helicopters, along with 830 gliders, including motor gliders, and 140 fixed-wing powered aircraft. =Twenty-first century= During the late 1990s, American aerospace company Bell Helicopters entered negotiations on the topic of acquiring a majority stake in IAR. According to aerospace periodical Flight International, Bell was at one stage set to purchase a 70 percent shareholding in the firm; this arrangement was closely tied to a planned procurement of the AH-1RO Dracula attack helicopter by Romania, which would have been manufactured locally by IAR. However, by 1998, the purchase was put on hold while efforts were made to raise funds for the AH-1RO purchase. Following a period of negotiations, in November 1999, Bell announced that it had abandoned its intentions to take over IAR and to locally produce the AH-1RO. During 2000, it was announced that the multinational helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter Group was holding discussions over its own bid for IAR. Later that same year, IAR established Eurocopter Romania in conjunction with Eurocopter, the former held a 49% stake in the newly-created joint venture.\\"Signature marks to the Go Ahead For Eurocopter Romania\\" Eurocopter. Eurocopter.com. Accessed 9 July 2011.\\"EC ROMANIA (EUROCOPTER ROMANIA SA)\\" Eurocopter. Eurocopter.com. Accessed 9 July 2011. In November 2015, Airbus Helicopters announced plans to invest ‚Ç¨52 million in a Romanian facility to manufacture the 8.6t H215M Super Puma; this arrangement was reportedly reliant upon an initial order for 16 being placed by the Romanian government to extend the type's production.\\"Romania to host production of new, robust, and cost- effective H215 heavy helicopter.\\" Airbus Helicopters, 17 November 2015.

Birman originally named his formalism the TMG Schema (TS), after TMG, an early parser generator, but it was later given the name TDPL by Aho and Ullman in their classic anthology The Theory of Parsing, Translation and Compiling.  Definition of a TDPL grammar  Formally, a TDPL grammar G is a tuple consisting of the following components: * A finite set N of nonterminal symbols. * A finite set Œ£ of terminal symbols that is disjoint from N. * A finite set P of production rules, where a rule has one of the following forms: ** A ‚Üê Œµ, where A is a nonterminal and Œµ is the empty string. ** A ‚Üê f, where f is a distinguished symbol representing unconditional failure. ** A ‚Üê a, where a is any terminal symbol. ** A ‚Üê BC/D, where B, C, and D are nonterminals. = Interpretation of a grammar = A TDPL grammar can be viewed as an extremely minimalistic formal representation of a recursive descent parser, in which each of the nonterminals schematically represents a parsing function. Each of these nonterminal-functions takes as its input argument a string to be recognized, and yields one of two possible outcomes: * success, in which case the function may optionally move forward or consume one or more characters of the input string supplied to it, or * failure, in which case no input is consumed. Note that a nonterminal-function may succeed without actually consuming any input, and this is considered an outcome distinct from failure. A nonterminal A defined by a rule of the form A ‚Üê Œµ always succeeds without consuming any input, regardless of the input string provided. Conversely, a rule of the form A ‚Üê f always fails regardless of input. A rule of the form A ‚Üê a succeeds if the next character in the input string is the terminal a, in which case the nonterminal succeeds and consumes that one terminal; if the next input character does not match (or there is no next character), then the nonterminal fails. A nonterminal A defined by a rule of the form A ‚Üê BC/D first recursively invokes nonterminal B, and if B succeeds, invokes C on the remainder of the input string left unconsumed by B. If both B and C succeed, then A in turn succeeds and consumes the same total number of input characters that B and C together did. If either B or C fails, however, then A backtracks to the original point in the input string where it was first invoked, and then invokes D on that original input string, returning whatever result D produces. = Examples = The following TDPL grammar describes the regular language consisting of an arbitrary-length sequence of a's and b's: S ‚Üê AS/T T ‚Üê BS/E A ‚Üê a B ‚Üê b E ‚Üê Œµ The following grammar describes the context-free language parentheses language consisting of arbitrary-length strings of matched braces, such as '{}', , etc.: S ‚Üê OT/E T ‚Üê SU/F U ‚Üê CS/F O ‚Üê { C ‚Üê } E ‚Üê Œµ F ‚Üê f The above examples can be represented equivalently but much more succinctly in parsing expression grammar notation as S ‚Üê (a/b)* and S ‚Üê ({S})*, respectively.  Generalized TDPL  A slight variation of TDPL, known as Generalized TDPL or GTDPL, greatly increases the apparent expressiveness of TDPL while retaining the same minimalist approach (though they are actually equivalent). In GTDPL, in place of TDPL's recursive rule form A ‚Üê BC/D, we instead use the alternate rule form A ‚Üê B[C,D], which is interpreted as follows. When nonterminal A is invoked on some input string, it first recursively invokes B. If B succeeds, then A subsequently invokes C on the remainder of the input left unconsumed by B, and returns the result of C to the original caller. If B fails, on the other hand, then A invokes D on the original input string, and passes the result back to the caller. The important difference between this rule form and the A ‚Üê BC/D rule form used in TDPL is that C and D are never both invoked in the same call to A: that is, the GTDPL rule acts more like a \\"pure\\" if/then/else construct using B as the condition. In GTDPL it is straightforward to express interesting non-context-free languages such as the classic example {anbncn}. A GTDPL grammar can be reduced to an equivalent TDPL grammar that recognizes the same language, although the process is not straightforward and may greatly increase the number of rules required.Ford, Bryan. Parsing Expression Grammars: A Recognition-Based Syntactic Foundation Also, both TDPL and GTDPL can be viewed as very restricted forms of parsing expression grammars, all of which represent the same class of grammars.

The Regimental motto is Festina Lente (\\"Make Haste, Slowly\\"). World War I Constituted on 5 July 1918 in the National Army as Battery D, 42nd Field Artillery, an element of the 14th Division. It was organized on 10 August 1918 at Camp Custer, Michigan. Serving in one campaign of the First World War, Alsace 1918, the unit returned to Camp Custer, Michigan where it was demobilized on 7 February 1919. Pre-WWII The unit was reconstituted on 1 October 1933, in the Regular Army as Battery D, 42nd Field Artillery. It was absorbed on 1 October 1940, by Battery A, 42nd Field Artillery Battalion. Battery A, 42nd Field Artillery was redesignated on 1 October 1940, as Battery A, 42nd Field Artillery Battalion, and activated at Fort Benning, Georgia, as an element of the 4th Division (later redesignated as the 4th Infantry Division). World War II Battery A, 42nd Field Artillery Battalion participated in 5 campaigns in the Second World War: Normandy (with arrowhead indicating participation in the initial assault), Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe. After the war, Battery A, 42nd Field Artillery Battalion was inactivated on 16 February 1946, at Camp Butner, North Carolina. Cold War Battery A, 42nd Field Artillery Battalion reactivated on 15 July 1947, at Fort Ord, California, before being consolidated on 28 June 1950, with Battery A, 42nd Coast Artillery Battalion (which had been first organized in 1907). The consolidated unit designated as Battery A, 42d Field Artillery Battalion). Former Battery D, 42nd Field Artillery, was reconstituted on 1 April 1957, in the Regular Army and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Battalion, 42nd Artillery. It was redesignated on 23 April 1959, as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Howitzer Battalion, 42nd Artillery, and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division with its organic elements concurrently constituted. The Battalion activated on 6 May 1959 at Fort Lewis, Washington. It was redesignated on 1 October 1963, as the 4th Battalion, 42nd Artillery. Vietnam War The Battalion served as part of the 4th Infantry Division through 11 campaigns in Vietnam, arriving in August 1966 as a towed 105mm howitzer battalion to render direct support to the 4th's 2nd Brigade. The unit participated in the following campaigns: *Counteroffensive Phase II *Counteroffensive Phase III *Tet Counteroffensive *Counteroffensive Phase IV *Counteroffensive Phase V *Counteroffensive Phase VI *Tet 69/Counteroffensive *Summer-Fall 1969 *Winter-Spring 1970 *Sanctuary Counteroffensive *Counteroffensive Phase VII After the conflict in Vietnam, the unit returned and was inactivated on 15 December 1970, at Fort Carson, Colorado. While inactive, the unit was redesignated on 1 September 1971 as the 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery, and remained inactive until 1996. Last unit assignments Based at Fort Hood, TX from 1996 to 2009, and then at Fort Carson, Colorado, until 2014, the 4‚Äì42 FA was under the command of U.S. 1st Brigade 4th Infantry Division. Each of the three gun batteries (A, B, C ‚Äì later only A and B), supported a different battalion in the brigade. Headquarters and Headquarters Battery (HHB) provided the necessary support components for the running of the battalion and was also home to Fire Support Specialists or \\"Fisters.\\" The battalion was the first in the Army to transition to the new Conservative Heavy Division (CHD) design, and also the first Artillery Battalion to test, field, and train with the digital system (FBCB2) Future Battle Command Brigade and Below. The battalion was equipped with the M109A6 Paladin Self Propelled Howitzer, which fires a 155mm family of munitions, and is the most technologically advanced cannon in the Army inventory. While originally designated as a field artillery battalion, they also deployed and conducted operations similar to that of an infantry battalion in order to support the ever-changing needs of the United States Army during wartime. The battalion deactivated on 17 March 2014 at Fort Carson, CO. Camp Buehring, Kuwait.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army photo by Spc. Andrew Ingram, 1st ABCT PAO, 4th Inf. Div.) Operation Iraqi Freedom Alerted on 19 January 2003, 4-42 FA (and the 4th Infantry Division) was scheduled to take part in the Iraq War in the spring of 2003 by spearheading an advance from Turkey into northern Iraq. The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the battalion's equipment remained offshore on ships during the initial buildup for the invasion - meaning that 4ID and 4-42 would have to reroute operations through Kuwait instead of Turkey. The battalion deployed to Iraq through Kuwait in late April 2003. Combat operations were conducted initially in the area of Taji Airfield, just outside Baghdad. The battalion moved north to the Tikrit area, leaving Battery B at Taji in support of Task Force Gunner until approximately October 2003. The battalion (less B Btry until fall) was stationed at FOB Arrow near the village of Ad-Dawr, slightly to the southeast of Tikrit along the Tigris River, with various fire support elements attached to 1-22 Infantry, 1-10 Cavalry, 1-66 and 3-66 Armor, as far south as Samarra and north past Tikrit. During their time at FOB Arrow the battalion conducted infantry operations in their sector. These operations included dismounted OP/LP operations around their area (specifically Ad-Dawr), mounted and dismounted combat patrols, raids against high-value targets or suspected insurgents, and general patrolling and stability operations in and around Ad-Dawr. In addition to these non-traditional roles, the battalion still provided fire support to the 1st Brigade and other units in the area. 4‚Äì42 continued to conduct combat operations until their redeployment in March 2004. During this first deployment to Iraq, the battalion was responsible for capturing several former regime members that were wanted by the coalition, captured scores of weapons and explosives, and engaged in direct combat with insurgents and terrorists in their area. Red Dawn The battalion also participated in Operation Red Dawn in December 2003, and had unit members on the objective during the capture of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Stability operations The battalion helped to rebuild schools and adopted the Nasiba Primary School for Girls, completing its refurbishment in November 2003. Much focus was given to providing security to the local population, insuring safe and secure access to public services such as power and water, food distribution and fuel/petroleum sales. Iraq, 2005‚Äì2006 The battalion was deployed again in December 2005 to Camp Taji, 14 kilometers north of Baghdad. The Straight Arrow battalion was given the task of providing security for Camp Taji and maintaining a presence on Highway 1. They returned to Fort Hood in December 2006. Iraq, 2007‚Äì2009 The 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery, Straight Arrows, deployed to Iraq for its third tour in March 2008 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom 07-09. This tour saw the battalion separated from its parent brigade and attached to 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. Headquartered inside the International Zone of Baghdad, the Straight Arrows were charged with the task of supporting the Iraqi Army and monitoring the Karkh and Mansour districts of Baghdad. During this deployment the battalion supported two joint-security stations and conducted more than 3,500 total patrols in the district. The Straight Arrows then redeployed in March 2009 to Fort Hood, Texas for the last time. Return and restationing at Fort Carson Once they redeployed and uncased their colors, they changed battalion commanders in June 2009 and immediately moved to Fort Carson, Colo. July and August 2009 were spent standing up the battalion at Fort Carson, establishing systems, conducting reset operations and building combat power. The fall of 2009 gave the battalion opportunities to conduct multiple squad and platoon- level training events. The Straight Arrows finalized the fielding of their howitzers from PMHBCT during the week of Thanksgiving and then immediately conducted Table VIII certification. The training provided soldiers an excellent environment with temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees and several inches of snow. In January 2010, 4‚Äì42 FA deployed in similar weather conditions to provide indirect fires in support of Alpha Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger training on Fort Carson ranges. The battalion's deployment mission was finalized and the Straight Arrows transitioned the entire formation to a motorized infantry battalion. The battalion participated in Raider Blitz, a brigade field training exercise, as a motorized infantry battalion. Then the Straight Arrow battalion, as a member of the 1st (Raider) Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, deployed to the Joint Readiness Training Center for counterinsurgency training, in April 2010, with the battalion conducting maneuver operations as a battlespace operator. The battalion also completed deployment preparations, conducted final training for theater requirements and executed torch and advance party operations to Afghanistan. Operation Enduring Freedom The battalion completed its rotation to Afghanistan as part of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division's deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The battalion initiated relief in place/transfer of authority with 4th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, part of 4th Brigade, 82nd Airborne in late July 2010. The unit conducted security force assistance operations with the Afghanistan National Army (ANA), the Afghanistan Provincial Police Forces and by supporting the national defense security. The battalion remained focused on security operations in support of Afghanistan as well as increasing the Afghan National Security Forces capabilities. 4-42 Field Artillery was able to make great progress in the Farah Province through constantly engaging the Taliban, by taking the Dukin/Charpoc Charmas area along with improving the security and quality of life for the Masaw District. 4-42 FA was relieved in place in July 2011 by the 2d Brigade Combat Team Special Troops Battalion, 2d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, and redeployed to Fort Carson. Inactivation The battalion was de-activated by the Army along with the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry regiment on 17 March 2014 at Fort Carson, Colorado. The colors of the unit were cased and sent to the Army Center of Military History.

They located and marked targets with flares, which a main bomber force could aim at, increasing the accuracy of their bombing. The Pathfinders were normally the first to receive new blind bombing aids like Gee, Oboe and the H2S radar. The early Pathfinder Force (PFF) squadrons was expanded to become a group, No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group in January 1943. The initial Pathfinder Force was five squadrons, while No. 8 Group ultimately grew to a strength of 19 squadrons.Royal Air Force, Bomber Command No.8 Pathfinder Force Group , accessed December 2011 While the majority of Pathfinder squadrons and personnel were from the Royal Air Force, the group also included many from the air forces of other Commonwealth countries. History =Background= At the start of the war in September 1939, RAF Bomber Command's doctrine was based on tight formations of heavily armed bombers attacking during daylight and fending off attacks by fighters with their defensive guns. In early missions over France and the Low Countries there was no clear outcome regarding the success of the bomber's guns: the Luftwaffe lacked widespread radar so their interception efforts were disorganized. On 18 December 1939, a raid by three squadrons of Vickers Wellington targeting ships in the Heligoland Bight was detected on an experimental Freya radar long before it reached the target area. The British bomber force was met by German fighters that shot down 10 of the 22 bombers, with another two crashing in the sea and three more written-off on landing. The Luftwaffe lost only two fighters in return. Although the causes for this disastrous outcome were heavily debated, it became clear that bomber forces could no longer defend themselves on their own. Bombing raids either needed to have fighter escort, which was difficult given the limited range of the fighters available at the time, or attacks had to be made at night when the enemy fighters could not see them. In the era before the widespread use of radar and the techniques needed to guide fighters to their targets with radar, night bombing would render the bombers vulnerable only if they were picked up by searchlights, a relatively rare occurrence. Offsetting the advantages of night bombing was the understanding that identifying the targets and attacking them accurately would be much more difficult. This meant a night bomber force was only useful against very large targets, like cities, and was one of the reasons daylight bombing was considered. The Germans had also studied this problem and had invested considerable effort in radio navigation techniques to address this, demonstrating a standard of bombing accuracy during the night raids that daylight forces found difficult. The RAF lacked similar navigation systems, having ignored their development for a number of years, and relied almost entirely on dead reckoning and optical instruments such as the Course Setting Bomb Sight. In limited visibility conditions or when the target did not have a clearly distinguishing landmark, accurate bombing was very difficult. Bomber Command pressed ahead with a night bombing campaign starting in 1940. Bomber crews reported good results, turning for home if they lost their way or could not find the target due to weather, and pressing on only if they felt confident they could identify the target with certainty. However, it was not long before reports started reaching the UK from observers on the ground reporting that the bombers were never even heard over the targets, let alone dropping their bombs nearby. At first these reports were dismissed, but as other branches of the UK armed forces complained, a report was commissioned to answer the question. The result was the Butt Report of 18 August 1941, which noted that by the time the aircraft reached the Ruhr, only one in 10 ever flew within five miles of its target. Half of all the bombs carried into combat and dropped‚Äîmany returned undropped‚Äîfell in open country. Only 1% of all the bombs were even in the vicinity of the target. Clearly something had to be done to address this or, as the other forces suggested, the strategic campaign should simply be dropped. Around this time Frederick Lindemann wrote an infamous report on dehousing, suggesting that the bomber force be directed against German urban areas, destroying as many houses as possible and thus rendering the German workforce unable to work effectively. Accepting the recommendations of Lindemann's report after intense debate, the British began planning a major offensive starting in the spring of 1942 with the express aim of destroying German cities. Also, by 1940 the British had started development of a number of night navigation aids, and were already testing the Gee hyperbolic navigation system on combat missions. These would be available in quantity in early 1942, just as the first of the new heavy bombers, the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, would be arriving in quantity. These technological developments dovetailed with the policy changes influenced by Lindemann's report. =Formation= Faced with the same navigation problems as the RAF, the Luftwaffe had developed radio aids that were widely used during their bombing campaign, the Blitz of 1940/41. Lacking enough equipment to install in all their aircraft, a single experimental group, Kampfgruppe 100, was given all available receivers and trained extensively on their use. KGr 100 would fly over their target using these systems and drop flares, which the following aircraft would then aim their bombs at. On rare occasions KGr 100 was used as a pure bombing force, demonstrating the ability to drop bombs within 150 yards of their targets in any weather. The KGr 100 unit itself would, in mid- December 1941, be redesignated I.Gruppe/Kampfgeschwader 100, as the basis for a new Luftwaffe bomber wing, or Kampfgeschwader (literally \\"battle formation\\") that bore the same unit number. The British, who had developed similar navigation aids, faced the same problem of quantity. Bomber Command expected to have only 300 Gee sets available by January 1942, all of them hand-built examples. Mass-produced models were not expected until May. As it turned out, both predictions proved optimistic. An obvious solution to the Bomber Command's problems would be to simply copy the German technique of placing all available sets in a lead force. This was first proposed by Group Captain S. O. Bufton. Bomber Command's commander-in-chief Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris argued against the idea, with the backing of the majority of his Group commanders. His view was that an elite group would breed rivalry and jealousy, and have an adverse effect on morale.A.S.Jackson, Pathfinder Bennett, P.59 Adding fuel to his argument was his own personal dislike for Bufton. His own idea for improving accuracy was to hold competitions within groups to deliver improved bombing. In rebuttal, Sir Henry Tizard, adviser and one of the chief scientists supporting the war effort, responded \\"I do not think the formation of a first XV at rugby union makes little boys play any less enthusiastically.\\" Studying the German results, notably reports by R. V. Jones, the Air Ministry decided that the technique was sound, and they overrode Harris' objections and forced the matter. Harris responded by suggesting the pathfinders be distributed among the squadrons, but again his objections were overruled, as this would not produce the desired result of having the targets clearly marked in advance of the arrival of the main force. A specialist force was formed in August 1942 by transferring existing squadrons from the Bomber Command groups to make up the \\"Path Finder Force\\" (PFF). The PFF initially comprised five squadrons; one from each of the operational Bomber Command Groups: No. 1 Group contributed No. 156 Squadron RAF (equipped with the Vickers Wellington medium bomber), No. 2 Group No. 109 Squadron RAF - then \\"special duties\\" - (Wellingtons and Mosquitoes), No. 3 Group No. 7 Squadron RAF (Short Stirling heavy bombers), No. 4 Group No. 35 Squadron RAF (Handley Page Halifax) and No. 5 Group No. 83 Squadron RAF (Avro Lancaster). The PFF was commanded by an Australian officer, Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett. Bennett was to be the youngest officer promoted to RAF Air Vice Marshal, at the age of 33, in 1943. However, Bennett was not the first choice‚ÄîHarris opposed the first choice of the Air Ministry, Basil Embry, the leader of 2 Group. The squadrons were located on adjacent airfields within No. 3 Group at Oakington, Graveley, Wyton and Warboys with a headquarters at RAF Wyton. No. 3 Group was responsible for the Force administratively though it was under the direct command of Harris. =Early action= The PFF was first put into action on the night of 18/19 August 1942, when 118 Bomber Command aircraft attacked Flensburg. PFF bombers were the first 31 aircraft of the raid, including Stirlings, Halifaxes, Lancasters and Wellingtons - from No. 7, 35, 83 and 156 squadrons. Flensburg, on an inlet of the Baltic, was in theory an easy target for the PFF on their first operation, but the winds shifted and the bomber force drifted north of the target to a part of Denmark whose coast also had many inlets. 16 PFF crews claimed to have marked the target area and 78 Main Force crews claimed to have bombed it. Reports from Flensburg stated that the town had not been hit at all, but a Danish report showed that the towns of S√∏nderborg and Abenra and a large area of Denmark up to 25 miles north of Flensburg were hit by scattered bombing. 26 houses were destroyed and 660 were damaged but only four Danish people were injured. The raid was a dismal failure, much to the delight of both Harris and other detractors of the strategic force as a whole. The PFF's second mission was against Frankfurt on the night of 24/25 August. The group once again had great difficulty identifying its target in cloudy conditions, and most of the bombs fell in open country north and west of Frankfurt. Local reports stated that some bombs fell in the city, with 17 large and 53 small fires and with moderate property damage. Five people were killed including two anti-aircraft gunners, and 95 people were injured. The outlying villages of Schwalbach and Eschborn were heavily bombed. Six Lancasters, five Wellingtons, four Stirlings and one Halifax were lost, 7.1% of the force. Five Pathfinder aircraft, including that of the commanding officer of 7 Squadron, were among the losses. The PFF finally proved itself on the night of 27/28 August 1942 against Kassel. There was little cloud over the city, and the Pathfinders were able to illuminate the area well. Widespread damage was caused, particularly in the south-western parts of the city. Kassel reported that 144 buildings were destroyed and 317 seriously damaged. Several military establishments were hit and 28 soldiers were killed, more than the civilian toll of 15, with 187 civilians and 64 soldiers injured. Among the buildings severely damaged were all three of the factories of the Henschel aircraft company. Of the 306 aircraft attacking the target, 31 were lost, 10.1% of the force. The next night the PFF operated against Nuremberg as part of a force of 159 aircraft. Crews were ordered to attack Nuremberg at low altitude, and the PFF used new target illuminators adapted from 250 lb bomb casings. Photographs showed that these were placed with great accuracy and the crews of the Main Force claimed to have carried out a good attack. However, a report from Nuremberg stated that some bombs were dropped as far away as the town of Erlangen, nearly 10 miles to the north, and four people were killed there. In Nuremberg itself, the number of bombs recorded would indicate that approximately 50 aircraft hit the town. 137 people were killed; 126 civilians and 11 foreigners. 23 bombers were shot down, 14.5% of the force. Most of these were Wellingtons, which lost 34% of their number. On 1/2 September 1942 the PFF illuminated Saarbr√ºcken as part of a 231 aircraft force, but post-raid analysis showed this to be Saarlouis, 13 miles to the north and situated on a similar bend in the river. The next night a force of 200 bombers were led by accurate marking in Karlsruhe, and the raid was considered a great success, with an estimated 200 fires seen burning. Reconnaissance photographs showed much residential and some industrial damage. A very short report from Karlsruhe says only that 73 people were killed and that three public buildings in the city centre were hit. =Improved technique= As the PFF gained experience, new problems appeared. Many bombers in the Main Force lost their way to the target and either bombed randomly or turned for home. Another problem was that the illuminators would go out before the raid was complete, leaving the following aircraft to bomb on visible fires, if there were any. This led to the problem of \\"creepback\\", when the newly arriving bombers would drop their bombs on the near side of the fire so they could turn for home earlier. This led to subsequent bombs slowly walking backward along the attack vector, away from the target. To address these problems the PFF adopted new techniques. Their force was split into three groups for each raid. The \\"illuminators\\" would drop white target illuminators at points along the attack vector, allowing aircraft to follow these markers over long distances and thus avoid getting lost en route. The \\"visual markers\\" would drop coloured target indicators on the target, but only if they were sure it had been identified. Finally the \\"backers-up\\" or \\"fire starters\\" used the visual markers' flares as the aim point for their own incendiary bombs to light fires in the proper location, which would burn longer than the flares. The new technique was first employed on 4/5 September 1942 on a raid of 251 aircraft against Bremen. The weather was clear and the PFF marked the target correctly, with the majority of the following Main Force finding the target and bombing it. The post-raid analysis showed that 460 houses had been destroyed, 1,361 seriously damaged, and 7,592 lightly damaged. Added to this list were hundreds of light and medium industrial buildings, including the Weser aircraft works and the Atlas shipyard and associated warehouses. The raid was a complete success. Another improvement was the introduction of larger bomb casings for the target indicators, starting with the \\"Pink Pansy\\" in an adapted 4,000 lb casing. Using these for the first time on the night of 10/11 September 479 aircraft attacked D√ºsseldorf and caused enormous damage. In addition to thousands of houses destroyed or heavily damaged, 39 industrial firms in D√ºsseldorf and 13 in Neuss were damaged so much that all production ceased, and 19,427 people were \\"bombed out\\". =German counterefforts= The Germans were well aware of the RAF's target marking, and quickly deduced the basic strategy was a copy of their own from 1940/41. German intelligence reports from later in the war show a wealth of information on the PFF.\\"British Pathfinder Operations as at March 1944\\", Luftwaffenfuhrungsstab Ic/Fremde, Luftwaffen West, 1944 On the night of 15/16 October 1942 on a raid by 289 aircraft against Cologne, the Germans lit a decoy target indicator that deceived the majority of the Main Force's bombs. Only one 4,000 lb, three smaller General Purpose, and 210 incendiary bombs hit the town, of a force of almost 70,000 bombs in total. Follow-up efforts during October and November were mostly small raids, including a number against cities in Italy. Weather and operational problems meant that raids during this period were limited and of greatly varied results. =New systems, increasing tempo= On 20/21 December 1942, H. E. Bufton personally led a force of six de Havilland Mosquitos on a raid against a power station at Lutterade, a small town in the Netherlands. Led entirely by the new Oboe navigation system, several bombs fell within 2 km of the target. The test was considered a success. A follow-up under more realistic conditions was carried out on the night of 31 December 1942/1 January 1943 against D√ºsseldorf, with two Mosquitos leading a force of eight Lancasters. Only one of the Oboes worked, but that was enough for the following heavies to bomb on and hit a number of industrial buildings. Another mission by three Mosquitos attacked the German night-fighter control room at Florennes airfield in Belgium, but there was complete cloud cover and the results were not known. It was clear by this point, after less than six months, that the PFF concept was a great advance. Picked crews from the bomber groups were allowed to transfer and the PFF soon expanded into a completely new Group ‚Äì designated No. 8 Group (PFF) ‚Äì in January 1943. In April 1943 the group's strength was increased by two squadrons, with No. 405 (RCAF) Squadron, flying Halifaxes and No. 97 Squadron, flying Lancasters. In June the Pathfinders gained two more squadrons ‚Äì Nos. 105 and 139 Squadrons, both of which were flying Mosquitos from RAF Marham. Later in the month Pathfinder HQ moved from RAF Wyton to Castle Hill House in Huntingdon. When new aircraft, such as the de Havilland Mosquito became available, the PFF got the first examples, and then equipped them with ever more sophisticated electronic equipment, such as Oboe, the radio navigation and bombing aid. By January the pace of Bomber Command missions had dramatically increased, with major raids being carried out almost every day. On 11/12 February 1943 against Wilhelmshaven, the PFF used their H2S radar for the first time, dropping parachute flares above the heavy cloud cover in a technique known as \\"sky marking\\". The follow-up force observed an incredible event, a huge explosion seen through the complete cloud cover that lingered for 10 minutes. It was later learned this was the explosion of the naval ammunition depot at Mariensiel, which destroyed 120 acres. Mission size continued to grow throughout, and although many missions continued to mark the wrong targets or fail for other reasons, the damage being caused continued to increase. On one particularly successful raid against Essen on 5/6 March 1943, 160 acres of land were destroyed with 53 separate buildings within the Krupp factories hit by bombs. =Master bomber= On the night of 20/21 June 1943 another change in technique was tested by 60 Lancasters (mostly from 5 Group) against Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen which were believed to be making radar. In this raid one of the Lancasters was equipped with new high-frequency radio equipment that allowed them to communicate with the other bombers in the attack force.In the operation against the German dams of May 1943, Guy Gibson had directed the individual bombing runs against the M√∂hne then Eder dams. The follow-up force consisted of several groups, including PFF aircraft, who marked the target based on radio instructions from what would become known as \\"the Master Bomber\\". Another group of aircraft were to attempt a new technique, bombing at a specific time after passing a ground feature, in this case the shores of Lake Constance. Nearly 10% of the bombs hit the factory in what was considered a great success. A combination of these techniques was first used on a large raid to great success on the night of 17/18 August 1943 in Operation Hydra against German rocket research at Peenem√ºnde. 596 aircraft were led by a Master Bomber to a series of target indicators dropped at several different locations around the target area. By dropping different colours of indicators and calling aircraft to attack each one in turn, the entire area was heavily bombed. The aircraft from No.5 Group used their time- from-landmark technique again. The estimate has appeared in many sources that this raid set back the V-2 experimental programme by at least two months and reduced the scale of the eventual rocket attack. The V-2 team had to hastily move their testing facilities elsewhere. The Master Bomber became a common feature of large-scale raids from this time onwards. The United States Army Air Forces operated a similar force within the Eighth Air Force for \\"blind- bombing\\" through overcast on daylight missions using H2X radar-equipped bombers, for which it also used the terms \\"Pathfinder\\", \\"PFF\\", and \\"master bomber\\". = Rivalry in Bomber Command = Although the AOCs of the Groups had been mixed in their enthusiasm for the Pathfinder Force, they generally supported it. AVM Roderic Carr (4 Grp) was opposed to its creation but had identified Bennett (10 Sqn was in 4 Grp) as the sort of person suitable for the job and passed over a squadron of Halifax heavy bombers. AVM Coryton had been a greater opponent but supplied a squadron of the new Avro Lancasters.Maynard p88 There was rivalry between 8 Group and 5 Group, driven by the personal rivalry between Bennett and the leader of 5 Group, Sir Ralph Cochrane. Through the CO of 617 Squadron Leonard Cheshire, Cochrane was an advocate of precision low-level marking, and lobbied heavily to be allowed to prove the theory, and for 5 Group to attempt targets and techniques that 8 Group would not.Morris p136 Cheshire personally marked targets using first a high speed medium bomber, the Mosquito, then later a Mustang fighter bomber. 617 Squadron achieved high levels of accuracy using the Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight; with the necessary accuracy of only at the V weapon launch site at Abbeville. 5 Group also invented various techniques, such as the \\"5 Group corkscrew\\" to evade enemy fighters, and the \\"quick landing system\\". =Light Night Striking Force= The Light Night Striking Force (LNSF) was an outgrowth of the Pathfinder Force use of the fast and long-ranged Mosquito bomber, which could carry a sizeable bombload. Under 8 Group, the number of Mosquito squadrons was built up. These were used for harassing raids on Germany. To the two (Oboe-equipped) Mosquito squadrons already in Pathfinder Force, a third (No. 139) was added in June 1943, which Bennett intended to use for diversionary raids to draw the German nightfighters away from the main force.Maynard, p. 120‚Äì121 In February 1944 an entirely Mosquito raid was mounted against D√ºsseldorf. It was formed of the usual marker aircraft from 105 Squadron and 692 Squadron Mosquitos, each carrying a single 4,000 lb \\"cookie\\",The Mosquito was able to carry these bombs all the way to Berlin, and regularly did. and backup aircraft with 500 lb delayed action bombs.Maynard p121 With Harris' support, Bennett formed more Mosquito squadrons to expand the LNSF, giving him nine bomber squadrons, as well as the Oboe-equipped markers and 8 Group's own meteorological Mosquitos. The LNSF achieved 27,239 sorties, their best month being March 1945 with nearly 3,000 sorties. This was achieved with the loss of just under 200 aircraft on operations or \\"damaged beyond repair\\".Maynard p122 Over the course of its history the Pathfinder Force flew a total of 50,490 sorties against some 3,440 targets. At least 3,727 members were killed on operations.  Tactics  The proportion of Pathfinder aircraft to Main Force bombers could vary according to the difficulty and location of the target; 1 to 15 was common, though it could be as low as 1 to 3. By the start of 1944, the bulk of Bomber Command was bombing within 3 miles of the PFF indicators, an appreciable improvement in accuracy since 1942. The success or failure of a raid now largely depended on the Pathfinders' marker placement and the success of further correction marking. =Individual tasks= PFF crews found themselves given ever increasingly sophisticated and complex jobs that were constantly modified and developed tactically during the bombing campaign from 1943 until the end of the war. Some of the more usual tasks were as: \\"Finders\\"; these were 8 Group aircraft tasked with dropping sticks of illuminating flares, firstly at critical points along the bombing route to aid navigation and keep the bomber stream compact and then across the approximate target area. If conditions were cloudy then these were dropped \\"blind\\" using H2S navigational radar. \\"Illuminators\\"; were PFF aircraft flying in front of the main force who would drop markers or target indicators (TIs) onto the designated 'aiming point' already illuminated by the \\"Finders\\". Again, if conditions were cloudy H2S navigational radar was used. These TIs were designed to burn with various and varying colours to prevent the German defenses lighting decoy fires. Various TI's were dubbed \\"Pink Pansies\\", \\"Red Spots\\", and \\"Smoke Puffs\\". \\"Illuminators\\" could include Mosquitoes equipped with \\"Oboe\\" if the target was within the range of this bombing aid. \\"Markers\\"; would then drop incendiaries onto the TIs just prior to the Main Force arrival. Further \\"Markers\\" called \\"Backers-Up\\" or \\"Supporters\\" would be distributed at points within the main bomber stream to remark or reinforce the original TIs as required. As the war wore on, the role of \\"Master Bomber\\" was introduced. This was an idea that had been used by Guy Gibson in the Dam Busters raid. Bennett wanted to lead raids but was denied operational flying as Harris was not prepared to risk losing him. The appointed Pathfinder (usually an experienced senior officer) circled the target, broadcasting radio instructions to both Pathfinders and Main Force aircraft, correcting aiming points and generally co-ordinating the attack. In September 1944, Gibson himself died in a Mosquito after performing as \\"master bomber\\" for a raid on Germany. =Types of marking= Three types of target marking were developed by the Pathfinders. These were known by the codenames Parramatta, Wanganui and Newhaven ‚Äì the names coming from locations in Australia, New Zealand and the UK which had links with Pathfinder staff. If the Oboe system was used to determine the release point then the word \\"Musical\\" was used as a prefix, e.g. \\"Musical Parramatta\\". ;Parramatta :Parramatta used navigation aids such as H2S radar or Oboe radio signals to drop the markers. ;Newhaven :Newhaven used illumination flares dropped above the target area to light it up sufficiently for a visual marking by the Pathfinder aircraft. ;Wanganui :Wanganui was used when the target was obscured by cloud, industrial haze, or a smoke screen. Oboe or H2S was used to release the markers over the unseen target. The target indicators used were on parachutes to give an aiming point that could be seen by the main force. This was also known as \\"sky marking\\". In all cases, further target Indicators would be dropped in the course of the raid to reinforce the marking and to compensate for earlier TIs either burning out or being extinguished by the bombing. =Equipment= For marking the Pathfinders used a number of special \\"Target Indicator\\" (TI) markers and bombs. These ejected coloured flares or illuminated the target. *Candle Aircraft, TI, Bomb, Type H :the candle was the basic indicator. About 2 feet long and about 2 inches in diameter, it sequentially ejected flare pellets that burned for 15 seconds each. The type H was filled with alternately coloured pellets (red/yellow or red/green or yellow/green), and illuminated for about 5 1/2 minutes in total Candles and other pyrotechnics were used as the fillings for the various Target Indicator bombs. *No. 1 Mk 1 TI Bomb *No. 7 Mk 1 Multi-flash Bomb *No. 8 Mk 1 Spotfire Bomb Squadrons and stations Between 1942 and 1945 *No. 7 Squadron RAF - Stirling, then Lancaster *No. 35 Squadron RAF - Halifax, then Lancaster *No. 83 Squadron RAF - Lancaster *No. 97 Squadron RAF - Lancaster *No. 105 Squadron RAF - Mosquito *No. 109 Squadron RAF - Wellington, then Mosquito - Oboe *No. 128 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1944 *No. 139 Squadron RAF - Mosquito *No. 142 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1944 *No. 156 Squadron RAF - Wellington, then Lancaster *No. 162 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1944 *No. 163 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1945 *No. 405 Squadron RCAF - Halifax, then Lancaster *No. 571 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1944 *No. 582 Squadron RAF - Lancaster formed 1944 *No. 608 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1944 *No. 627 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1943 *No. 635 Squadron RAF - Lancaster formed 1944 *No. 692 Squadron RAF - Mosquito formed 1944 83, 97 and 627 Squadrons passed to 5 Group in April 1944 ;Stations *RAF Bourn *RAF Downham Market *RAF Graveley *RAF Gransden Lodge *RAF Little Staughton *RAF Marham *RAF Oakington *RAF Upwood *RAF Warboys *RAF Wyton  See also  * List of Royal Air Force groups * RAF Bomber Command Aircrew of World War II  Notes  References =Sources= * (Diary), \\"Campaign Diary, August 1942\\", Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary, RAF, 6 April 2005 * (Pathfinder), \\"No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group\\", RAF * * Maynard, John Bennett and the Pathfinders, Arms and Armour London, 1996, * Morris, Richard.

The mode of play is based on rugby league with many similarities to touch football, although tag rugby is often deemed as a closer simulation of the full contact codes of rugby than touch. Attacking players attempt to dodge, evade and pass a rugby ball while defenders attempt to prevent them scoring by \\"tagging\\" ‚Äì pulling a velcro attached tag from the ball carrier, rather than a full contact tackle. Tag rugby is used in development and training by both rugby league and rugby union communities. Tag rugby comes in several forms with OzTag and Mini Tag being some of the better known variations. Tag rugby has the highest participation levels in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. right History According to sportswriter Terry Godwin, writing in 1983, tag rugby was first developed in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar Rugby Union. Due to the lack of grass pitches, an alternative variant to rugby union was developed. A 10-inch cord was tucked into the waistband, and its removal by an opponent with a shout of \\"tag\\", was classed as a 'tackle'. If the attacking team had failed to score by the fourth 'tackle' the defending team were given possession of the ball.Despite several sites reporting that tag rugby was invented by Perry Haddock in Australia around 1990 (this is OzTag, a variant of Tag Rugby), Godwin's wrote about the topic seven years prior. Godwin does not mention when the sport began on Gibraltar, but he does explicitly use the term \\"Tag Rugby\\" to describe the game. The codified version of tag rugby was created and pioneered by physical education teacher Nick Leonard in England in 1990 following an idea given to by a former serviceman called Barry Johns. He described to Nick how navy servicemen on board ship or whilst playing on hard grounds overseas played the Gibraltar variant of rugby. Leonard then devised a set of rules suitable for children using belts and coloured ribbons attached by Velcro and organised the first ever schools Tag Rugby festival at UCP Marjons, Plymouth in 1991. This annual event celebrated its 20th festival in 2011. Tag rugby variants = OzTag = OzTag is a non-contact form of rugby league, and can be seen as a variation of British tag rugby. Cronulla Sharks and St George Dragons halfback Perry Haddock introduced the sport in Australia while coaching the 1992 St George Jersey Flegg side. Together with Chris Parkes, the two took the sport to fields across Australia. Today, it is played by over 200,000 players in organised leagues across the country. Games are usually played over 20 minutes a half. The normal dimensions of the field are 70√ó50 metres. Eight players in each team are allowed on the field at a time. The attacking team has five plays or tags to try to score a try or take the ball down field as close to the line as possible. Like most versions of tag rugby, a tackle is made when one of two velcro stripes, known as tags, is removed from the ball carrier's shorts. Players can pass and kick the ball and tries are worth one point and there are no conversions. Kicking in general play is allowed but it must be below shoulder height of the referee and on zero count with no play-the-ball (from playing a knock-on advantage for instance) or after the fourth tag. For mixed gender games, there is a maximum of four male players per team on the field and a try scored by a female player is worth two points, compared to one point for male players.Oztag Rule Book 2013 = Mini Tag = The rules of under-7s Mini Tag possess some rugby union features, like an unlimited tackle count. It does not have an equivalent of the six tags law and instead tackled players must off-load the ball. Under-8s Mini Tag on the other hand, retains a six tag law (RFU Continuum 3.5.g) which requires that on the 7th tag the referee will stop the game and give the ball to the other side. The restart is with a free pass. For the full set of rules of Mini Tag see the Mini Tag Rulebook. Mini Tag is currently the only form of rugby permitted by the English RFU for under-7 and under-8 age groups. Mini Tag requires the use of a size 3 rugby ball and does not allow scrums, line-outs or kicking. Tag rugby worldwide =Australia= Since its beginnings in 1992, OzTag (or Walla Tag) has grown in popularity across Australia in urban and rural areas. Twenty- eight teams participated in the first season in summer 1992‚Äì1993 playing in the Cronulla and St George areas of Sydney. Today, more than 80,000 players take part in OzTag competitions nationally. There are Oztag competitions running all over Australia, with the largest areas located in Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra. Competing teams are in six divisions: women's open, mixed, men's open and men's over-30s, 35s, and 40s. =England and Great Britain= In 2003‚Äì04, the English Rugby Football Union introduced Mini Tag into its junior development program called The Three Stages of the Rugby Continuum, replacing touch rugby. Tag rugby also developed via IMBRL (Inter Message Board Rugby League) where message boards representing clubs took part in tournaments and friendly matches. Some developed into full-contact teams, others became tag teams and others folded. In 2008, a Tag Merit League was established based on the RL Merit League format. The league was developed with the intention to encourage new clubs outside the older IMBRL circuit to play tag rugby league. The Merit League operates on normal rugby league laws with tags taking the place of tackles. In 2009 Try Tag Rugby began running adult tag rugby competitions throughout London using OzTag rules. By the summer of 2011, over 1,000 players were regularly taking part in week night evening leagues across London at locations such as Finsbury Park, Gladstone Park, Wandsworth Town, Tooting Bec, Richmond, Shoreditch, Highbury and Southwark Park. The number of competitions continues to expand with over 240 teams competing across venues in London and Reading in the summer of 2014. Try Tag Rugby also host the annual London Tag Rugby Championships which attracts teams from across the UK and Europe. 42 teams registered for the event in 2013, playing 136 matches under 17 referees across nine pitches; a UK record for an adult Tag Rugby tournament. In September 2014 the Rugby Football League and Try Tag Rugby announced that they would be forming a partnership to increase participation in the sport across England. In early 2015 Try Tag Rugby announced they were expanding to Yorkshire, with leagues set to begin in April 2015. Try Tag Rugby have continued to grow the game substantially in 2016 with 507 teams competing in early summer leagues. Try Tag Rugby are the UK's official delegates of the European Tag Federation (ETF) and the International Tag Football Federation (ITFF). The Great Britain Tag Rugby Team has hosted inbound tours from Australia in 2011 and 2014, and the Tongan over 30s Men's team in 2013. The Great Britain mixed open and men's teams also competed in the 2012 Tag Rugby World Cup in Auckland, New Zealand, while 2013 saw the first annual Britain and Irish Cup. In 2016 Ireland won British & Irish Cup for a third time, by defeating Great Britain 4 - 2 across a record six categories. In 2017 Great Britain competed against Ireland in Cork across six categories once again, with Ireland retaining the cup winning the Mixed Open, Mixed Seniors, Women's Open and Women's Seniors divisions to take a 4-2 Victory.https://trytagrugby.com/london/representative/great-britain-tag- rugby/british-irish-cup/ In 2018, Great Britain played Ireland at the British & Irish Cup in Dublin, in preparation for the ITF Tag World Cup held in Coffs Harbour Australia in November 2018. The tournament was reduced to four categories and Ireland again retained the cup for a fifth consecutive time narrowly defeating Great Britain by 26-22 competition points with the Great Britain Men's Open and Men's Seniors teams picking up victories. At the 2018 ITF Tag World Cup, Great Britain came away with three medals, including a silver medal in the Men's Seniors division, a bronze medal in the Women's Seniors and a Men's Open victory in the Plate competition, whilst the Mixed Open side lost in the Plate Semi-Finals to New Zealand. In 2019 off the back of great momentum from the 2018 World Cup, Great Britain won the British & Irish Cup for the first time, defeating Ireland 4-2 in London, winning the Women's Seniors, Women's Open, Men's Open and Mixed Seniors categories, with the tournament once again expanded to six categories. =Ireland= The Irish Tag Rugby Association (ITRA) introduced adult tag rugby to Ireland in 2000 in association with the Irish Rugby Football Union when the first ever league was run for 36 teams. Their league is known as Volvic Tag . The Irish Rugby Football Union began to run its own tag rugby leagues in 2007 following a split with ITRA. The sport has become particularly popular in Ireland and in 2007, over 28,000 players in the two programmes making up more than 1,700 teams took part in tag rugby at 50 venues all over the country. This increased in 2008 and 2009. There are four major types of tag rugby played there. They include men-only leagues, women-only leagues, mixed leagues (in which a minimum of one player must be female with no more than four male players on the pitch), and vets league (over-35s). Each type is usually played in four different ability categories ranging from A league (the most competitive) through B, C, and beginners league (the most inexperienced and usually the least competitive). Veterans leagues comprise teams of players all over 35 yrs old. Many companies pay for or sponsor company teams as a method of recreation hence this format of rugby's popularity and its non-contact nature makes it playable for mixed sex and age teams and inter-office competitions. The Pig 'n' Porter Festival is held each July in Old Crescent RFC, Limerick. It is the largest single Tag Rugby tournament in the world with up to 150 tag teams taking part each year for the top prize. The tournament regularly attracts teams from England, Scotland, France and the Netherlands. In 2014 the ITRA introduced Rep rules which aligned their laws with the International Tag Federation. Players have the opportunity of playing for their Regional Teams (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Clare and Kildare) from which players can play in the Tag World Cup representing Ireland. = Hong Kong = HKTag developed in direct association with Hong Kong Rugby League (HKRL), itself established in 2015. Leveraging the official rules of OzTag, tag rugby first appeared at the inaugural 2015 HKRL Nines, as a minimal contact, mixed format alternative to rugby league, and brought together more than 100 male and female players. The growth of HKTag was the HKRL standout success of 2016. HKTag became the official governing body of Tag Rugby in Hong Kong and launched two more domestic competitions - Battle of Origin and HKTag Super League. This year also saw the introduction of regular social tag rugby sessions throughout spring and summer, which today continue all year round. HKTag today has a solid community of members, participating in weekly Tag for All sessions, beginners' workshops, summer beach tag and seasonal competitions. The 2018 HKTag Challenge saw its highest ever participation, involving 12 teams and more than 140 players from all over the world. In November 2018, Hong Kong sent a squad to the Tag World Cup in Coffs Harbour representing the mixed open and male open divisions. =New Zealand= In the Summer of 1993-4 Tag was introduced to New Zealand by Mr John Ackland a development officer with the Auckland Rugby League who had been to Sydney and met with the founder of Oztag Perry Haddock from Oztag Australia to expand the game in Auckland New Zealand. The First Kiwitag module was launched and run by John Ackland from Fowlds Park in Auckland on Monday nights for 8-10 weeks. From this Tag would begin its growth and development in Auckland and Porirua Wellington. The Otahuhu Tag Module and Wellington would be recognised partners to Oztag in New Zealand. Unfortunately, The game was to implode politically and become fragmented for the next 8 years. The Otahuhu and Porirua based NZTag body lead by Mr Wally Tooman and Mrs Hilda Harawera gained control of the game at international level, with the rest of the tag modules at the time from Howick, Northcote, Mt Albert, Waitemata Pakuranga and Ellerslie excluded and left to fend for themselves with no assistance from Otahuhu based NZTag or the Auckland Rugby League. It was not until the summer of 2000 that a meeting initiated by Mr Stan Martin and Mr William Halligan of the ARL was held at Carlaw Park between all the exiled tag modules to bring everyone together under one umbrella in the Auckland region. This would result in the formation of Auckland Kiwitag Inc with the Otahuhu NZtag Module declining to join the organisation. Oztag Australia's Perry Haddock would eventually reach out to the Chairman of Auckland Kiwitag Mr Claude Iusitini to play New Zealand teams selected from players outside of the Otahuhu Module for the first time and continue to do so to this day. Auckland Kiwitag would continue to administer the game of tag from 2004 to 2009 in amalgamation with Porirua Tag in Wellington then in September 2009 would rebrand and relaunch itself as New Zealand Tag Football Incorporated which has now been the recognised National body for all things tag football in New Zealand for over 10 years; see www.nztagfootball.co.nz. In 2003 the New Zealand Rugby Union established \\"Rippa rugby\\" ‚Äì a variant of tag football ‚Äì as a developmental tool and game for young children, and for primary school tournaments.Small Blacks Rippa rugby A split in the Auckland Kiwitag Board would see the launch of another version of tag called Tag20 Rugby a hybrid version of tag in New Zealand which was led by Mr Gary Bauer and Mr Todd Price in partnership with Australia based Steve 'Chief' Lyons. . =Tonga= Tonga National Tag Team is the Tonga national tag team also known as Laione Hau or Tonga Tag. Established in October 2011, The first official national Tonga Tag team participated in the Pacific Cup hosted by New Zealand in February 2012. All variants of Tag Rugby and Flag Football are played in Tonga. =Samoa= Samoan Tag Incorporated is the National Tag Sports body in Samoa. Established in 2018, The first official Tag tournament was held in Apia on 3 February 2018. =Sri Lanka= Sri Lanka Oztag, established in 2015, participated in its first official tournament in 2015, the Emerging Nations Tournament before competing at the 2015 World Cup. In 2016, Sri Lanka Oztag won the Emerging Nations Tournament and will be competing in the 2018 World Cup. =USA= A tag game known as EagleTag, or non contact rugby league or flag rugby, is played in the United States using the same rules as Oz Tag.\\"EAGLETAG is the American version of Flag Rugby. Flag Rugby is the latest craze in recreational sport that has competitions running all over Australia, New Zealand, England, and now in the USA!\\" (). Another tag game based on the laws of rugby union, known as American flag rugby, takes place in a league every Saturday morning in July in Morris County, New Jersey. (republished on the website of American Flag Rugby) =International tag rugby league festivals= The Rochdale Swarm International Mixed Tag Rugby League Festival returned for its 7th year on 1 August 2015. Teams from France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales regularly participate alongside teams drawn from Rochdale, including Fijians and the local Asian Community, plus Kiwi and Aussie exiles. This is complemented by teams from all across England. The festival is a non-contact, mixed gender 7-a-side competition, where at least 2 of the 7 are female. The Pig 'n' Porter Tag Rugby festival, the largest in the world, is held each July on the grounds of Old Crescent Rugby Club, Limerick, Ireland. Over 120 teams take part in the weekend event. The popularity of the event can also be attributed to the apr√®s-tag festivities which include a hog roast and live music. The Malta International Tag Rugby Festival was launched in 2011 with teams having contested the festival in its first two seasons from England, Scotland, France and the Maltese islands of Malta and Gozo. The festival is a partner event of the Malta Rugby League (MRL). London's Try Tag Rugby All-Stars have been a regular feature at the festival every year since its inception and the festival is becoming known as 'the hottest tag rugby festival in Europe'. Winners of the Malta International Tag Rugby Festival have been Try Tag Rugby All-Stars - UK (2011), Try Tag Rugby All-Stars - UK (2012) and Tumeke - UK (2013). In December 2015 Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia hosted the Tag Rugby World Cup.2015 Tag Rugby World Cup  Try Tag Rugby, Play Tag Rugby in London, Reading and Yorkshire In November 2018, the Tag Rugby World Cup will be held in Coffs Harbour, Australia.

Created by character designer Tetsuya Nomura, he has since appeared in the CGI film sequel, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children as well as other games and media in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII series. As of Advent Children, Barret is voiced by Masahiro Kobayashi in Japanese and Beau Billingslea in English localizations. Barret is first introduced in Final Fantasy VII as an eco-terrorist, leading the group AVALANCHE to bomb Mako reactors in the fictional city of Midgar, so as to avenge the losses dealt him by the megacorporation Shinra, the Planet's de facto world government, who operate under the pretense of saving the Planet. As the story progresses, Barret re-examines his efforts and focuses on pursuing the villain Sephiroth in an effort to protect the planet and the future of his adopted daughter, Marlene. Elements of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII would later expand upon his character, detailing the character's history before and after the events of the original game. The first black playable character in the Final Fantasy series, Barret's appearance, and sometimes profane speech has been heavily compared to that of the actor Mr. T. He is also considered to be the first true father figure in the series, for his relationship with his adoptive daughter Marlene. His character arc is also considered a deconstruction of a revenge story, as a former coal miner seeking vengeance through eco-terrorism before eventually realizing revenge isn't the right motivation. The character has earned much praise, but also criticism and accusations of racism by some. Conception and design Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Barret was present in Final Fantasy VII from its early development. Initially, the game was to have only three playable characters, with Barret one of those three, along with the protagonist Cloud Strife and the heroine Aerith Gainsborough. During a phone call to project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith, as they felt Barret's death would be \\"too obvious.\\" Barret's name is based on the Japanese transliteration of the English word \\"bullet\\", and he was developed with the \\"Gunner\\" character class in mind. Standing 6 feet 5 inches (197 cm) tall, he is the first black playable character in the series, and has a high and tight haircut and full beard, and an earring in his left ear. His attire consists of a jacket with torn sleeves, dark green pants, boots, a fingerless glove on his left hand, and metal bands surrounding his abdomen and left wrist. His left upper arm is covered by a bowgun; this was later changed by replacing his right hand with a prosthetic gatling gun (called a \\"Gimmick Arm\\") which he refers to as his \\"partner\\" in-game. He was originally planned to have a medallion around his neck, described as a gift from his deceased wife, but this was later changed to a set of dog tags. When developing Advent Children, Nomura stated that because of the comparisons between Barret's original design and Mr. T, they decided to take it in a different direction for the film, implementing co-director Takeshi Nozue's suggestion to give him cornrows for his hair, while Nomura designed his face. Artist Yusuke Naora influenced the design as well, developing his attire, which originally consisted of white overalls, before instead having him wear him a down vest. Barret's arm tattoo was changed as well, although it retained the \\"skull and fire\\" motif of the original. Other aspects of his design included the loss of the metal bands around his body, a white sleeve extending from the middle of his right forearm to his elbow fastened by straps, a black band on his left forearm surrounded by a pink string and bow, and a fishnet shirt that ends in torn fibers below his waist. The dog tags were altered to a bullet and medallion supported by a chain around his neck, and three rings covered his left hand. His Gimmick Arm was modified into a robotic prosthetic hand, developed by Nomura, with the only guideline being \\"a huge, over-the-top gun that transforms in a huge, over-the-top way.\\" Nozue stated that these specifics made it difficult to work with, and decided to conceal the hand's transformation sequence into the gun as much as possible. His Advent Children design was also planned to be used for the Final Fantasy VII remake. However, the staff later decided to give every character in the party a new look. When choosing a voice actor for the film, Nomura was initially unsure of whether to have Masahiro Kobayashi do the role of Barret or another character, Loz. Kobayashi described his performance as treating Barret as \\"unrefined [...] but also dependable and unique,\\" trying to keep his \\"upbeat character and good outlook in mind.\\" He tried to give him a booming, confident-sounding voice, though at times was instructed to \\"take it up a notch.\\" In the remake, Square wanted to show Barret as a mature person, contrasting him from the younger Cloud when interacting with others. In the English dub of the Final Fantasy VII remake, John Eric Bentley did the voice of the character. During localization of the game, Bentley did not know the exact media in which he would portray Barret but was sure it had to do with the remake. Bentley made research in order to portray Barret properly. He was aided by the translators for the Japanese version who gave him the context of the scenes he had to record. For him, one of the biggest challenges in his work was \\"representation\\" and claimed that Barret was more than one-dimensional character. In regards to the story's mission to destroy the Mako Reactor 5, Square aimed to show Barret as a fitting leader for AVALANCHE as well as to show how his relationship with Cloud is improved across it. Appearances =Final Fantasy VII= First seen in Final Fantasy VII in 1997, Barret is introduced as the leader of the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. Situated in city of Midgar, his group opposes the ruling company, Shinra, and their use of \\"Mako\\" energy as a power source, believing it to be killing the Planet. To this end, AVALANCHE bombs their Mako reactors, with the specific goal of saving the Planet. When the game begins, they have just hired the mercenary Cloud Strife at the behest of his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member Tifa Lockhart, nicknaming him \\"Spiky\\" in reference to his hairstyle. After the deaths of several members of AVALANCHE, Barret follows Cloud out of Midgar in pursuit of the game's villain, Sephiroth. Along the way, he encounters a former friend of his, Dyne, armed in a manner similar to him, who forces Barret to fight him. Upon Barret defeating Dyne, Dyne kills himself. Through flashbacks it is revealed that Shinra had wanted to build a Mako reactor in his home town of Corel, an idea Barret advocated. However, due to an accident at the plant, Shinra razed the town, killing Barret's wife in the process, and causing Barret and Dyne to flee with Dyne's daughter, Marlene. Cornered, Dyne slipped off a cliff and Barret grabbed his hand, but Shinra soldier's opened fire, and destroyed Barret's and Dyne's right and left hands respectively, causing the latter to fall to his presumed death. Barret adopted Marlene as his own daughter, had an \\"adapter\\" graft to his arm to interface with prosthetic weapons to aid in his combat against Shinra, and founded AVALANCHE. Dyne's death causes him to admit his grudge with Shinra is solely for revenge, with his earlier claims of \\"saving the world\\" meant only to convince himself he was fighting for the greater good. Barret eventually shifts his goal to actually wanting to save the Planet, doing so for Marlene's sake, and he helps Cloud and his allies defeat Sephiroth to prevent the Planet's destruction. Early drafts of Barret's background featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, and his wife executed in front of him by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought to investigate Shinra soldiers. =Compilation of Final Fantasy VII= Barret appears in Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, a 2005 mobile phone-based prequel to the events of Final Fantasy VII, which shows the events prior to Corel's destruction. He helps the game's protagonists, the Turks, defend the Mako reactor, believing it to be the town's future. It is revealed that the reactor is under attack by the original AVALANCHE group, who are the cause of Shinra's attack upon the town. Unaware of their involvement, Barret uses their ideals to form his own branch of the group. In 2005, Barret appeared in the CGI film Advent Children, which details the events two years after Sephiroth's defeat. Barret places Marlene in Tifa's care, travelling the world to rebuild the planet's infrastructure and find alternate power sources to replace Mako. He returns later to assist in combating the film's villains, the Remnants and fight the summon creature Bahamut SIN. He later appears in a small role in the 2006 video game Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII, set one year after Advent Children, where he helps the protagonist Vincent Valentine prevent Omega WEAPON from destroying the planet. A novella entitled \\"Case of Barret\\" was released in 2007 exclusively for the \\"Limited Edition Collector's Set\\" DVD edition of Advent Children. Written by Kazushige Nojima as part of the On the Way to a Smile series, it details the events between Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children, examining Barret's reaction to his weapon and his belief that it made him a monster. At the conclusion of the story, Barret visits the creator of the adapter on his wrist and receives the prosthetic hand/gun combination seen in the film, reasoning that although he needs a hand, he also still needs a weapon to prevent others from having to fight. He then decides to return to Marlene. Critical reception Pat Holleman, in his book Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VII (2018), considers Barrett's story to be the clearest illustration of the game's central \\"theme of tragic survivorship\\" and \\"a deconstruction of a revenge story\\" in the sense that it \\"dismantles the idea of revenge in an insightful way.\\" This is presented through Shinra's destruction of his coal mining hometown, Barrett seeking vengeance through militant environmentalism before eventually realizing revenge isn't the right motivation, and safeguarding a future for his adoptive daughter Marlene who is the only surviving connection to his past. William Hughes of The A.V. Club notes that Barret and his terrorist cell AVALANCHE are one of the few examples of \\"heroic pop culture terrorists\\" in video games, keeping the game politically relevant in a post-9/11 world. Barret's comparisons to Mr. T in the media has resulted in both praise and criticism, with most of the criticism accusing the character of serving as a negative racial stereotype of African Americans. IGN argued in favor of this point, citing his use of \\"stilted slang,\\" and stating that the character stands out amongst the cast because \\"his dialog is written as if it was run through a broken ebonic translator,\\" further noting a trend in Japanese games to apply such dialogue to characters based on their skin color. Journalist Jeremy Parish agreed that the character was racist, although he argued that cultural gaps between Japan and the United States, plus the lack of American translators for Final Fantasy VII may have been contributing factors, arguing that the likeness between Barret and Mr. T was possibly an attempt to make a character that appealed to Americans, as the actor did. In contrast, on 1UP.com, Parish argued in favor of Barret, noting that while on the surface he appeared to be the \\"worst kind of stereotype,\\" he was a great character with complexity, having made \\"difficult decisions in his life, and agonized over his losses.\\" Parish went further to describe Barret as the \\"first true father figure the [Final Fantasy] series had ever seen,\\" noting his relationship with his adopted daughter. RPGamer's content manager Shawn Bruckner took the discussion further, arguing that claims of Barret's presentation being racist was oversimplification of the character's portrayal, and stated that while he was in some aspects a stereotype, in others, such as his compassion towards his daughter or guilt regarding his past actions, he was not. He added that Barret \\"shows us that a black man speaking in 'ebonics' is not something to fear,\\" and that his portrayal was not racist, but instead the opposite. Despite their criticism, IGN ranked Barret fourth on their 2006 list of best sidekick characters in video games, stating that he \\"took the videogame world by storm\\" when introduced and noting that his portrayal was also appealing, adding that his past made him a visibly loyal character. Joystiq named him one of twenty characters from the Final Fantasy franchise they wished to see in Square Enix' crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy, noting a preference for his use of profanity and citing his combat abilities as easily suitable for the game. Edge praised Barret's introduction as something \\"new\\" in the series, citing both his use of a gun and his \\"distinctively black\\" character, and further describing him as a \\"pseudo-nod\\" to similarly armed characters, such as Mega Man or Samus Aran, who in contrast were either robots or encased in armor. Barret's portrayal in the Final Fantasy VII Remake was praised by Siliconera due to his constant interactions with Cloud and Tifa as well as how more humanized he is shown when Marlene is shown at risk. As a result, the site believes Square set the character a good potential for his role in future installments of the remake.

Note distinctive North African burnous. 1st Spahi Regiment, again with distinctive burnous. Spahis () were light cavalry regiments of the French army recruited primarily from the indigenous populations of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. The modern French Army retains one regiment of Spahis as an armoured unit, with personnel now recruited in mainland France. Senegal also maintains a mounted unit with spahi origins as a presidential escort: the Red Guard. Etymology The name is the French form of the Ottoman Turkish word , a word derived from New Persian , meaning \\"army\\", or \\"horsemen\\". Early history Following the French occupation of Algiers in 1830, detachments of locally recruited irregular horsemen were attached to the regiments of light cavalry assigned to North African service. These auxiliaries were designated as chasseurs spahis. Between 1834 and 1836 they were organised into four squadrons of regular spahis. In 1841 the 14 squadrons by then in existence were brought together in a single corps of spahis. Finally, in 1845 three separate Spahi regiments were created: the 1st of Algiers; the 2nd of Oran and the 3rd of Constantine.Lilane and Fred Funcken, page 88, \\"L'Uniforme et les Armes des Soldats du XIX Siecle\\" volume 1, The spahi regiments saw extensive service in the French conquest of Algeria, in the Franco-Prussian War, in Tonkin towards the end of the Sino- French War (1885), in the occupation of Morocco and Syria, and in both World Wars. A detachment of Spahis served as the personal escort of Marshal Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud in the Crimean War and were photographed there by Roger Fenton. A contingent of Spahis also participated in the North China campaign of 1860. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 one detached squadrons of Spahis formed part of the forces defending Paris, while a provisional regiment comprising three squadrons was attached to the Army of the Loire.Stephen Shann & Louis Delperier, page 10 \\"French Army 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War 2: Republican Troops\\", A serious uprising against French rule in Algeria during 1871‚Äì72 was sparked off by a mutiny of the 5th squadron of the 3rd Spahis, who had been ordered to France to reinforce those units already there.R. Hure, page 155, , Charles-Lavauzelle 1977 Under the Third Republic, between 1871 and 1914 Spahi units saw active service in Indochina, Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal and Madagascar. While a visually conspicuous presence in any French military force, the Spahis usually served in small detachments as scouts, skirmishers and escorts. An exception was the Battle of Isly in 1844 when the 1st and 2nd Spahis fought successfully as full regiments. Recruitment basis Prior to 1914 there were four regiments of Spahis in the French Army, three based in Algeria and one in Tunisia. During their period as mounted cavalry the Spahis comprised for the most part Arab and Berber troopers commanded by French officers. This division was not absolute however and there were always a certain number of French volunteers in the ranks (for example, the later well known lyricist Raymond Asso was a Spahi between 1916 and 1919). About 20% of the rank and file were French and the remainder Arab or Berber. In addition, a fixed number of commissioned positions up to the level of captain were reserved for Muslim officers. NCOs were both French and Muslim. In contrast to the North African tirailleur (infantry) units the mounted spahis were drawn from \\"the big tents\\": i.e. the higher social classes of the Arab and Berber communities. This dated back to the establishment of the corps when Colonel Marey-Monge required that each recruit provide his own horse.Douglad Porch, pages 71-72 \\"The Conquest of Morocco\\", As Spahi units were mechanized during World War II, the proportion of Frenchmen in the ranks increased. World War I Spahis were sent to France at the outbreak of war in August 1914. They saw service during the opening period of mobile warfare but inevitably their role diminished with the advent of trench warfare. During World War I the number of units increased with the creation of Moroccan Spahi regiments and the expansion of the Algerian arm. By 1918 there were seven Spahi regiments then in existence, all having seen service on the Western Front. In addition a detached squadron accompanied two squadrons of Chasseurs d'Afrique and served as part of the 5th Light Horse Brigade during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Ottoman Empire. This composite force of French cavalry was known as the 1er R√©giment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie de Levant. Between the World Wars By 1921 the Spahi regiments had been increased to twelve (from four in 1914) and this became the permanent establishment. During the 1920s mounted Spahi regiments saw extensive active service in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, as well as in Morocco. They continued to perform policing and garrison duties in Algeria and Tunisia. Although mechanisation began in the 1930s of the Chasseurs d'Afrique and Foreign Legion cavalry, the Spahis remained an entirely mounted force until after 1942. World War II Spahis withdrawing from the Sidi Bou Zid area, February 1943. In 1939 the Spahis comprised three independent brigades, each of two regiments and still horse mounted. Each regiment was made up of four sabre squadrons with five officers and 172 troopers in each. Three regiments saw active service in France in 1940. Hermann Balck was of the opinion that they were the best troops that he met in both world wars.https://de.scribd.com/doc/153227108/Balck-Interview Balck's interview with US Army, page 7. One Spahi regiment (1er R√©giment de Marche de Spahis Marocains) distinguished itself in service with the Free French during World War II. Garrisoned in Vichy-controlled Syria as part of a mounted cavalry unit some of the regiment crossed the frontier into the Transjordan in June 1940. After mounted service in Eritrea, this detachment was subsequently reorganised and equipped with armoured cars by the British in Egypt. The expanded and mechanised regiment served in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, and was part of the French forces that liberated Paris in August 1944. Post war In the course of World War II most Spahi regiments were mechanised, but several squadrons remained mounted for patrol work in North Africa plus escort and other ceremonial duties in France itself. Until 1961 the annual Bastille Day parade in Paris always featured Spahi cavalry in their traditional dress uniforms, on white Arabian horses. While Arab and Berber troopers continued to make up the bulk of numbers in the mounted units retained, mechanisation led to French personnel becoming a majority in the armoured regiments. Armoured Spahi units saw service in both the Indochina War of 1947-54 and the Algerian War of 1954-62. The 9th Algerian Spahis remained a mounted regiment throughout the Algerian War, suffering 24 deaths in the course of active service. Except for one mounted platoon per squadron and the regimental fanfare (trumpeters) the unit was finally mechanized in 1961 and its several hundred horses either sold in Algeria or shipped back to France. The 6th Spahis had been disbanded in 1956, followed by the 9th in 1961. Following the end of the Algerian War in 1962, the 2nd, 3rd 4th and 8th Spahis were also disbanded leaving only one, formerly Moroccan, regiment in existence as the 1st Spahis.Robert Hur√©, L'Armee d'Afrique, Charles-Lavauzelle (1977) , p. 462 Today Today the French Army retains one Spahi regiment, the 1er R√©giment de Spahis Marocains; an armoured unit which saw service in the Gulf War. The regiment also maintains the traditions of the entire Spahi corps as it previously existed. Until 1984 the Regiment was located in Speyer, Germany. Their former base there is now the Technikmuseum Speyer. The 1er Spahis are currently based in Valence, Dr√¥me, France, south of Lyon in the Rhone Valley or what is commonly referred to in France as The Doors of Provence. Uniforms Throughout most of their history the Algerian and Tunisian Spahis wore a very striking Zouave style uniform. It comprised a high Arab headdress, a short red jacket embroidered in black, sky blue waist coat () a wide red sash and voluminous light blue trousers. The four regiments were distinguished by the differing colours of their \\"tombeaus\\" (circular false pockets on the front of the jacket). A white burnous was worn together with a red cloak (blue for the Moroccan Spahis). French officers wore light blue kepis, red tunics with gold rank braiding and light blue breeches with double red stripes. Muslim officers wore a more elaborate version of the \\"tenue orientale\\" of the Arab and Berber troopers. French Spahis were distinguished by wearing a fez instead of a white Arab turban with its brown camel-hair cord. A less obvious distinction was the footwear‚Äîshort \\"sabattes\\" or traditional North African boots in red Morocco leather for Arab/Berber troopers, conventional black leather for French troopers. From 1915 on a more practical khaki uniform was adopted for service but the classic red and blue \\"tenue orientale\\" with white burnous reappeared for parade and off-duty wear in 1927. The mounted squadrons retained for ceremonial duties wore a slightly modified version of this parade uniform, with a plain white turban, until they were disbanded in 1962. The modern 1er Spahis still wear the traditional white burnous and red sash, together with the blue cloaks of the former Moroccan regiments, for full dress. The long- skirted sand-khaki gandourah coat adopted in 1915, appears on occasion as part of the modern ceremonial uniform. Headdress is either a scarlet forage cap or the standard light blue and red kepi of the French cavalry. Exceptionally for a French armoured cavalry regiment, it uses gold (and not the usual silver) insignia. The \\"Ordonnance du Roi portant organisation de la cavalerie indig√®ne en Algerie\\" of 7 December 1841 establishing the Spahis as a regular corps of the French Army specifies this distinction for sous-officers, brigadiers and officers both French and indigenous.Pierre Rosiere, p52 \\"Spahis - des spahis algeriens aux gardes rouges de Dakar\\", Equipment In 1914 spahi armament was the M1822/82 sabre of the French light cavalry together with the 1892 carbine. All harness was of dark-red red leather, of indigenous North African pattern and manufacture. Indochinese Spahis Short-lived cavalry units designated as \\"spahis\\" were raised by the French Colonial Army in Indochina. The first of these was a squadron of spahis recruited from Cochinchina in 1861 and disbanded in 1871. The second was a small detachment of \\"Spahis Tonkinese\\" raised in Tonkin in 1883 and disestablished in 1889 for budgetary reasons.Maurice Rives, page 42, \\"Les Linh Tap\\", Spahis in other armies =Senegalese Spahis= Spahi s√©n√©galais (illustration from C√¥te occidentale d'Afrique of Colonel Frey, 1890). Senegal maintains a mounted cavalry detachment of spahi origin as its modern presidential security unit and ceremonial guard. In addition to the North African cavalry, two squadrons of spahis were raised in French West Africa. The first spahis in Senegal were an Algerian detachment sent to West Africa in 1843 to deal with an outbreak of tribal conflict. This platoon-sized unit of 25 French and Algerian spahis Pierre Rosiere, \\"Spahis - des spahis algeriens aux gardes rouges de Dakar\\", p. 60 stayed and began recruiting locally. The troopers were recruited from the inhabitants of Senegal and the French Sudan while their French officers were seconded from Algerian Spahi regiments. The Senegalese Spahis saw extensive active service in the French West African territories of Tchad, the Sudan and the Congo between 1853 and 1898, as well as serving in Morocco between 1908 and 1919.Pierre Rosiere, \\"Spahis - des spahis algeriens aux gardes rouges de Dakar\\", pp. 121-122 The Senegalese Spahis were disbanded in 1928 as an economy measurePierre Rosiere, \\"Spahis - des spahis algeriens aux gardes rouges de Dakar\\", p. 137 but provided the cadre around which a newly-raised mounted gendarmerie was formed. The modern Gendarmerie Nationale of the Republic of Senegal therefore traces its origins to the spahis, and the Red Guard still wears the burnous, fez and red tunic of the French period. =Algerian Republican Guard and Tunisian President's Bodyguard= The modern Republican Guard of Algeria includes a mounted detachment for ceremonial purposes. This unit is mounted on the same breed of white barbs as those utilised by the French spahis prior to 1962 and wear red and green uniforms with white burnouses, which broadly resemble those of their predecessors. A similar ceremonial mounted unit is maintained as part of the Tunisian President's Bodyguard. Descended from the 4th Tunisian Spahis Regiment the modern unit retains the uniform of the French period but in the red and white of the Tunisian national colours. Rinaldo D. D'Ami, page 46 \\"World Uniforms in Colour\\", Volume 2, Patrick Stephens Limited 1969, SBN 85059 040 X \` =Italian Spahis= The Italian colonial administration of Libya raised squadrons of locally-recruited Spahi cavalry between 1912 and 1942. The Italian Spahis differed from their French namesakes in that their prime role was that of mounted police, tasked with patrolling rural and desert areas. Although they had Italian officers, they were more loosely organised than the regular Libyan cavalry regiments (Savari).They wore a picturesque dress modelled on that of the desert tribesmen from whom they were recruited.Plates I & IV, \\"Under Italian Libya's Burning Sun\\", The National Geographic Magazine August 1925 References Sources * Paul Oddo. \\"Calots Rouges et Croix de Lorraine - Les Spahis de Leclerc\\" * Ian Sumner. \\"The French Army 1914‚Äì18\\" . * Pierre Rosiere. \\"Spahis - des spahis algeriens aux gardes rouges de Dakar\\" * Charles Lavauzelle. \\"L'Armee d'Afrique 1830‚Äì1962\\" * External links *Musee de Spahis in Senlis, Oise France Category:Cavalry units and formations of France Category:Arm√©e d'Afrique Category:Army units and formations of Italy ","title":"Spahi"},{"id":"892759","text":"is a fictional character in Square's (now Square Enix) role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII. Created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura, she has since appeared in the fighting game Ehrgeiz and made cameo appearances in several other titles, as well as the CGI film sequel to Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children and related games and media in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII series. A member of the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE and owner of the 7th Heaven bar in the slums of Midgar, Tifa is the childhood friend of Cloud Strife, the protagonist of Final Fantasy VII. Convincing him to join the group to keep him close and safe, she later assists him in saving the Planet from the game's villain, Sephiroth. Installments in The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII later expanded upon her character, such as in the film Advent Children, where she attempts to convince Cloud to let go of his self-imposed guilt, and move on with his life after Sephiroth's defeat. Named the pin-up girl of the \\"cyber generation\\" by The New York Times, Tifa has been compared to Lara Croft as an example of a strong, independent and attractive female character in video games. Media have repeatedly praised both the character's strength and appearance and described her as one of the best female characters in gaming. Appearances =Final Fantasy VII= Introduced in Final Fantasy VII, Tifa is the childhood friend of Cloud Strife, and owner of the 7th Heaven bar, as well as a member of the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE, who oppose the megacorporation Shinra and their use of Mako energy as a power source. She convinces Cloud to join the group to keep a closer eye on him after noticing his personality has changed, and she follows him in pursuit of the game's antagonist, Sephiroth. Unable to keep him from being manipulated by Sephiroth, she helps him recover after his mind becomes fractured, and they realize their mutual feelings for one another, working together to defeat Sephiroth. In flashbacks, it is revealed that as children Tifa and Cloud had decided to follow a path to a mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa was in a coma for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident. Cloud eventually left to join Shinra's SOLDIER program in order to become stronger, but it is later revealed that he did it primarily to attract her attention. In response, she requested if she was ever in danger, he would return to save her. Years later, after Sephiroth destroyed the town of Nibelheim, Cloud rescued Tifa after she was wounded by Sephiroth. Surviving the incident, Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor Zangan, eventually arriving in Midgar and meeting AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace. Upon recovering, she joined AVALANCHE so as to get revenge for the destruction of her home. She eventually encountered an incoherent Cloud at the city's train station, and convinced him to work for Barret, so as to keep him close and safe. This is the point at which the game begins. In early drafts of Final Fantasy VII, Tifa was to be a background character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned-down version by Kitase in which a risqu√© line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview, Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time. =Compilation of Final Fantasy VII= The Advent Children version of Tifa, as portrayed by gravure idol Mizuki Hoshina promoting Sony Xperia at TGS 2014 In 2005, she appeared in the CGI film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, set two years after the events of the game. In it, she tries to give emotional support to Cloud, urging him to come to terms with the unwarranted guilt he places upon himself. In addition, she takes care of Barret Wallace's adopted daughter Marlene and another child, Denzel. During the film, she fights against one of the antagonists, Loz, and later she helps battle the summoned creature Bahamut SIN. Script writer Kazushige Nojima described her role in the film as \\"very much like any woman who's been left behind by a man,\\" stating that while they did not want her to appear clingy, they also wanted to portray that she was emotionally hurt by Cloud's departure. In the film's initial draft, she was intended to have a more central role in the then-short film, which only featured herself, Cloud, and several children, with the story revolving around a note being delivered to him. Tifa is featured in the prequel games Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, as well as the OVA Last Order: Final Fantasy VII. In each, her appearance relates to Nibelheim's destruction. The novella \\"Case of Tifa\\", written as part of the On the Way to a Smile series, is a story set between the original game and Advent Children. Told from her point of view, the story details how she creates a new 7th Heaven bar in the city of Edge and attempts to hold onto the concept of a normal family with herself and Cloud, despite him beginning to isolate himself from others. Tifa also appears briefly in the game Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII, set one year after the events of Advent Children in which she helps the protagonist Vincent Valentine defend the Planet against the monster Omega WEAPON; she later appears in the game's epilogue, discussing Vincent's apparent disappearance. =Other appearances= Outside of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Tifa appears in the fighting game Ehrgeiz, as an unlockable character and an optional boss. She later appears in the electronic board games Itadaki Street Special and Itadaki Street Portable. In Kingdom Hearts II, she appears in her Advent Children attire, searching for Cloud and later fighting various Heartless, the series' monsters. She was originally planned to appear in the Final Mix version of the original Kingdom Hearts, but due to time constraints the staff members chose to incorporate Sephiroth instead. Tifa is one of player characters in the fighting game Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, which features characters from various Final Fantasy games. She is featured in her Final Fantasy VII outfit, but the player has also access to her Advent Children form and a third form that is shown during Tifa's appearances in Nibelheim. The first print run of the game features another form based on artwork by Yoshitaka Amano. In LittleBigPlanet 2, Tifa is featured as a downloadable character model. Korean singer Ivy portrayed the character in a 2007 music video for the song \\"Ïú†ÌòπÏùò ÏÜåÎÇòÌÉÄ\\" (\\"Sonata of Temptation\\"). Recreating a fight scene from Advent Children, the video was banned from airing on Korean television after a copyright lawsuit by Square Enix citing plagiarism. In 2015 Tifa was added to the mobile game Final Fantasy: Record Keeper as a playable character. Creation and development Crisis Core. Although the character's attire has varied, a miniskirt was kept as a staple of her designalt=A girl at an angle to the viewer, with an orange cowboy-type miniskirt and midriff- baring shirt. A cowboy hat is strapped to her back. Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Tifa was not present in early versions of Final Fantasy VII, as initially, the game was to have only three playable characters; the protagonist Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough and Barret Wallace. However, during a phone call to project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura later joked that this was his idea, so as to enable him to introduce Tifa into the game. Regardless, the notion of having two concurrent heroines, and having the hero waver between them, was something Kitase liked, describing it as something new in the Final Fantasy series. Nomura describes Tifa's character in Advent Children as having several dimensions, calling her \\"like a mother, a sweetheart, and a close ally in battle\\" and \\"remarkably strong, not only emotionally, but physically as well.\\" Tifa was designed to use the \\"monk\\" character class that appears in previous games in the series. She has long, black hair in a style resembling a dolphin's tail at the tip, and garments described as simple and monotone, consisting of a white crop top and black miniskirt. She also wears red boots and gloves, with black sleeves extending from wrist to elbow; her skirt is held up by a pair of narrow black suspenders, and a large metal guard covers her left elbow. She stands about 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm) tall, and has measurements of 36-24-35\\" (92-60-88 cm). Initially, Nomura had difficulty deciding whether to go with a miniskirt or long pants. Seeking input, he passed his sketches around Square's offices, and the majority of the staff members approved of the miniskirt design. This additionally served as a contrast to Aerith, whose \\"Long Skirt\\" was her trademark. The attire was explained in respect to the game as giving her freedom of movement, due to her affinity with hand-to-hand combat, and the skirt, referred to as \\"quite short [...] giving a considerable degree of exposure,\\" was kept as a staple of her alternate costumes. The developers additionally noted that due to her figure, her otherwise plain garments took on a pleasant appearance. When producing Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, co-director Takeshi Nozue had difficulty developing a framework for Tifa's body that was \\"balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities.\\" Her outfit too was redesigned at this point, with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. A white tank top with black zipped up vest covers her front, a pink ribbon wraps around her left biceps, and boots cover her feet. A black buttoned-up skirt covers her thighs, and she wears shorts beneath, with a piece of cloth similar to a coattail extending from the back of the skirt's waistband and ending at her ankles. She no longer uses suspenders to hold up her skirt, and she wears her gloves only during the film's fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle of her back, with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was because of the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as problems that arose due to its black color and lighting. When the Final Fantasy VII Remake was developed, Square modified Tifa's original appearance to make her look more realistic as members from the staff realized her design would not fit fight scenes. As a result, she was given black undergarments and to fit her body, giving her a sporty feel. Due to Cloud being in a possible relationship with Tifa or Aerith, the development team observed fans thought Square was preferring any of these two heroines over the other. In retrospect, Square states that Aerith might have been the real main character of the game while Tifa was important in order to help develop Cloud's character. As a result, Square claims that both Tifa and Aerith are heroines in this remake. Nomura noted he liked Ayumi Ito as an actress, and wished to work with her on Advent Children. With Aerith's voice actor already decided, Nomura asked Ito to voice Tifa, feeling her \\"husky voice\\" would offer a good contrast to Maaya Sakamoto's soft-spoken Aerith. Nomura additionally noted that after completing Tifa's updated design, the producers debated about her finalized details, but once Ito had been cast for the role they chose to blend many traits from the voice actress into the character's final appearance. Ayaka Mitsumoto voiced Tifa in the flashback from the remake where a teenage Tifa interacts with Cloud. Finding a voice suitable for the young Tifa made Nomura and the staff worried in the recording of the title. English voice actress Rachael Leigh Cook has stated in an interview for Kingdom Hearts II that she enjoys playing Tifa and described her as \\"very strong physical and emotionally, but also very sensitive,\\" and as \\"very multi-dimensional\\". In voicing the character, Cook listened to Ito's recording as a guide to how the character sounds. Following Advent Children, Cook thanked Nomura for the film he created as she enjoyed it. Britt Baron replaced her for the Final Fantasy VII Remake. As a child, Tifa was voiced by Glory Curda. Reception Since her introduction, Tifa has received an extremely positive reaction from both critics and fans. In 2000, GameSpot readers voted her as the fifth-best female character in video games, with the site's editors noting they agreed. In 2004, Play featured Tifa in the first issue of their Girls of Gaming annual periodical, describing her as \\"the most adored female in recent history.\\" In 2007, Tifa was named the eighth-best character of all time in Dengeki PlayStations retrospective awards feature about the original PlayStation, the third-highest-ranked character from Final Fantasy VII.

Complex ranked her as the 13th-greatest heroine in video game history in 2013.

In 2008, Joystiq named her their top pick out of 20 characters from the Final Fantasy franchise they wished to see in Square Enix's crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy, describing her as one of the series' \\"greatest heroines.\\" IGN listed Tifa as the 13th-best Final Fantasy character of all time in 2008, describing her as an attempt by Square to \\"give Final Fantasy characters real sex appeal,\\" and someone who \\"could take care of herself in a pinch\\"; in a follow-up Reader's Choice edition of the list, Tifa placed first, with the staff repeating their previous comments while attributing her placement on the list to her breasts. In a 2009 IGN article focusing solely on Final Fantasy VII characters, Tifa placed fourth, with a comment that while her sex appeal contributes to her popularity, \\"Tifa helped drive a tradition of tough, independent RPG heroines.\\" Other sources too praised Tifa for that aspect of her character. Mania Entertainment placed her tenth in the 2010 list of \\"video game women that kick ass,\\" stating that while subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series introduced other memorable female characters, \\"Tifa is our first Final Fantasy girl and holds a special place in our hearts.\\" In 2013, Gus Turner of Complex ranked Tifa as the 12th-greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, stating that \\"next to Lara Croft and Samus, Tifa Lockhart stands out as one of gaming's most independent and empowered females ever.\\" Much of Tifa's reception regarded her sex appeal.

It is located adjacent to the Kruger National Park. In the late 1990s an unused portion of the base was converted into a civilian airport known as Eastgate Airport. It was also an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle. Units hosted * 19 Squadron - Helicopter squadron * 101 Squadron - Light transport (reserve) * 514 Squadron - Security services * 7 Aircraft Servicing Unit - Maintenance support * Lowveld Airspace Control Sector - Airspace control * Air Force Command and Control School - Training History The base was officially opened on 1 July 1978. It was designed from the start to be a highly protected wartime base. As such, it has armoured and Hardened Aircraft Shelters, with revetments placed close to the runways for aircraft on immediate take-off standby duty. The base is teeming with wildlife, being surrounded by the 25 km¬≤ AFB Hoedspruit Game Reserve. Keeping the runway clear of animals was a massive problem. This led the base to introduce three cheetahs on the airfield, with the end result that animal incursions onto the runway have decreased by 90%. Another SAAF base, AFB Makhado, has since also adopted this concept. The base gained international media attention in 2000, when it hosted the United States Air Force's rescue contingent as part of Operation Atlas Response, the mission to provide rescue and humanitarian support to areas of Mozambique devastated by the severe flooding caused by Cyclone Eline. The base motto is Pro Nostrorum Pace (Peace for our People). Eastgate Airport A civil airport terminal, known as the Eastgate Airport, was established at the southern end of the airfield in the early 1990s. The terminal's main business is serving tourists visiting private game reserves in the area as well as access to the Kruger National Park via the nearby Orpen Gate. Facilities at the terminal include car hire and foreign exchange. Charter flights are offered by Federal Air, Genair, Cesszani, Execujet, SA Historical Flight and Bataleur.

Since its merger with European Goldfields in 2011 the company has been pursuing the development of the Skouries mine, Olympias mine and Stratoni mine in Greece. The company previously developed and operated gold mines in China, Brazil and Mexico. Headquartered in Vancouver and listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges, Eldorado Gold has developed and operated assets from several merged companies HRC Developments Corporation, Afcan Mining Corporation, Sino Gold Mining, Brazauro Resources, Integra Gold, as well as European Goldfields.  Corporate history  The Eldorado Corporation was incorporated in Bermuda on April 2, 1992, by several entrepreneurs who worked together at Bema Gold. The group had agreed to a contract that would give them a 70% interest in the Mexican La Colorada mining project if they were able to bring the mine into commercial production. In early 1994, La Colorada became Eldorado's first productive mine and by the end of the year they had purchased its remaining interest. Meanwhile, they also fulfilled a similar contract, conducting development-related work in exchange for ownership interest, in the La Trinidad project, also in Mexico. While the mine began production in 1996, and Eldorado gained 100% ownership in 1997, it was shut down and then sold off in 1998 as the price of gold collapsed; La Colorada was sold in 2000 for the same reason. In April 1996, after fending off a hostile takeover bid by Glamis Gold the previous year, the company was renamed to Eldorado Gold Corporation and had its domicile moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. That year, they acquired the Brazilian S√£o Bento, as well as exploration properties in Brazil and Turkey, from Gencor in exchange for a 43% stake in the company. Gencor made a similar deal with Vancouver Stock Exchange-listed HRC Developments Corporation, 43% of the company for several exploration properties, and then Eldorado and HRC merged to form one company. S√£o Bento would be the company's sole operating mine from 2000 to 2006 as it focused on developing the Ki≈üladaƒü project in Turkey. Eldorado Gold increased the gold production from 64,298 ounces in 2005 to 632,539 ounces in 2010, despite the closure of the S√£o Bento in 2007, by bringing Ki≈üladaƒü into production in 2006, acquiring the Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Afcan Mining Corporation for its Tanjianshan Mine which it had acquired two years previous from Sino Gold Mining, and then acquiring Australian Securities Exchange-listed Sino Gold Mining, in a 2009 $1.6 billion all-stock deal, for their new Jinfeg and White Mountain mines. During this period of growth, Eldorado and Centerra Gold considered merging their operations but were unable to find sufficient advantages. Eldorado went on to be added to the S&P;/TSX 60 in 2009 as one of the largest companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In 2010 Eldorado acquired, in an all-stock deal worth $122 million, TSX Venture Exchange-listed Brazauro Resources for their share of the Brazilian Tocantinzinho exploration project. Later that year, Eldorado offered a $3.4-billion all-stock deal to acquire ASX-listed Andean Resources for their Cerro Negro project but were out-bid by Goldcorp who offered $3.6-billion in cash and stocks. Instead, Eldorado went on to acquire TSX-listed European Goldfields for $2.5-billion in stocks for its projects in Greece, as well as exploration properties in Romania.Eldorado Gold Corp. makes $2.5B all-stock bid for European Goldfields Ltd., huffingtonpost.ca 2011/12/18.Greece to rule on European Goldfields by February, Reuters 2010/10/21. Eldorado's gold production peaked at 789,224 ounces in 2014 from its three mines in China, the Ki≈üladaƒü mine in Turkey, supplemented by its second Turkish mine (Efemcukuru) which came online in 2012 and the old Olympias mine in Greece which the company was able to begin retreatment of leftover tailings. Eldorado Gold began a years long decline as it committed to selling its mines in China in favour of developing its properties in Greece. At the time, during its economic crisis, Greece was actively seeking foreign investment and its Skouries project had the potential to be a high producing, long-lived (over 20 years) gold and copper mine. Other companies had previously attempted to develop the Skouries mine but the government had deemed it as not being in the national interest but the need for foreign investment reversed that decision. However, Eldorado's projects in the Chalkidiki region had long been controversial as other mining projects left locals with little confidence in the government's ability to effectively regulate mining and manage economic development. The company spent US$1 billion by 2017, mostly on the Skouries project, without completing a mine and experiencing protests against the project, due to land clearing in a popular forest and anticipated impacts to environmental values, tourism and agriculture, as well as protests in favour citing the number of jobs the mining project represented. Eldorado Gold's assets in China were sold to China National Gold Group Corporation and the Shenzhen-listed Yintai Resources Company for a cumulative US$900-million in 2016 resulting in its gold production falling to 292,971 ounces in 2017. Despite having gained the Lamaque mine in Quebec with the company's $590 million cash and stock acquisition of TSX Venture-listed Integra Gold, the company suspended dividend payments in 2018 and their stock briefly fell under CDA$1, all while company was accused of using Dutch subsidiaries for tax avoidance purposes and excessively compensating executive management for poor performance.  Operations  As of 2020, Eldorado Gold operates 5 mines: *Ki≈üladaƒü gold mine, located in U≈üak, Turkey, has been the company's highest producing mine since its opening in 2006. The property was acquired by Eldorado with its 1996 merger with HRC Development and developed as a low-grade open pit mine with heap leaching to produce gold dore. *Efem√ßukuru mine, located in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey, near the village of Efem√ßukuru, reached commercial production in 2012. It is an underground mine targeting a high-grade deposit whose ore is sold to third parties for processing elsewhere. *Lamaque mine, located in Val-d‚ÄôOr, Quebec, Canada, is an underground gold mine that reached commercial production on March 31, 2019. *Olympias mine, located in the Chalkidiki region of Greece, is an underground gold-silver-lead-zinc mine that ships ore concentrates from port facilities in Thessaloniki and Stratoni for processing elsewhere. It was acquired in Eldorado's business combination with European Goldfields in 2012 and reached commercial production in 2017. *Stratoni mine, located in the Chalkidiki region of Greece, near Stratoni, is an underground silver-lead-zinc mine that ships ore concentrates from port facilities in Stratoni for processing elsewhere. =Past operations= *La Colorada, located in Sonora, Mexico, was Eldorado Gold's original mine. It began production in 1994 but was sold in 2000 to a private Mexican company. *La Trinidad, located in Sinaloa, Mexico, was brought into production by Eldorado in 1996 but was sold in 1998. *S√£o Bento, located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, was purchased from Gencor in 1996 and operated through to 2006. *Tanjianshan, located in a mountainous desert in Qinghai, China, the open gold pit mine was brought into production in 2007, following Eldorado's acquisition of the Afcan Mining Corporation. The high- altitude mine produced approximately 110,000 ounces annually of gold dore until 2016 when it was sold. *Jinfeg, located in Guizhou, China, the mine was a combined open pit and underground operation targeting a deep deposit. It was acquired by Eldorado with its 2009 acquisition of Sino Gold. The mine produced between 110,000 and 180,000 ounces of gold dore each year until 2016 when it was sold. *White Mountain, located in Jilin, China, near the city of Baishan. The underground mine was acquired by Eldorado in 2009 shortly after its opening. The mine produced between 60,000 and 85,000 ounces of gold dore each year until 2016 when it was sold. *Vila Nova iron ore mine, located in Amap√°, Brazil, operated from 2011 to 2014 and has since been on care and maintenance.  Environmental Impact  = Greece = The mining operation at Olympiada has been found to be in violation of Greek environmental protection laws by an inspection committee of the Greek Ministry of the Environment and Energy. The inspectors discovered, among other violations, concentrations over the allowed limits of cadmium, lead and arsenic in a water stream used by the mining operation.

While he was still a toddler, his mother married and moved to Detroit, Michigan, leaving the younger Otis Miles to be raised by both of his grandmothers in Texarkana. Hazel Williams moved her son to Detroit when he was ten years old, where he lived with his mother and his stepfather. Career Becoming interested in music as a teenager, Otis Miles, Jr. adopted his mother's maiden name for his stage name, and as Otis Williams put together a number of singing groups. These groups included Otis Williams and the Siberians, the El Domingoes, and the Distants. In 1959, The Distants scored a local hit, co-written by Williams and their manager/producer Johnnie Mae Matthews, called \\"Come On\\", with lead vocals by Richard Street. Future Distants recordings were not as successful, and after an offer from Berry Gordy of Motown Records, Williams and his friends/bandmates Elbridge \\"Al\\" Bryant and Melvin Franklin quit the Distants. Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams from The Primes later joined Williams, Bryant, and Franklin to create the Elgins, who signed to Motown in March 1961 as \\"The Temptations\\". The Temptations became one of the most successful acts in soul music over the course of nearly five decades, during which singers such as David Ruffin, Dennis Edwards, former Distant Richard Street, Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, Ali- Ollie Woodson, Theo Peoples, Ray Davis and former Spinners singer G.C. Cameron have all been members. The group's lineup changes were so frequent, stressful and troublesome that Williams and Melvin Franklin promised each other they would never quit the group. Franklin would remain in the group until 1994, when he became physically incapable of continuing. Franklin died on February 23, 1995, leaving Otis Williams, then 53, as the last surviving original member of the quintet. Williams is the co-author, with Patricia Romanowski, of Temptations, a 1988 book that served as both his autobiography and a history of the group. Ten years later, the book was adapted into a NBC television miniseries The Temptations. Williams was portrayed by actor Charles Malik Whitfield. Although he has served the longest tenure in the Temptations, Williams rarely sings lead, focusing instead on his role as the group's leader and organizer, and as the background \\"baritone in the middle\\". The Smokey Robinson and Eddie Kendricks written track \\"Don't Send Me Away\\" from the LP The Temptations with a Lot o' Soul (1967), the intro on the early group song \\"Check Yourself\\" (1961), most notably, \\"This Guy's in Love with You\\" from the albums Live at London's Talk of the Town and Diana Ross & The Supremes Join the Temptations and the Norman Whitfield-penned tune \\"I Ain't Got Nothing\\" from 1972's All Directions are rare showcases for Williams singing lead. Williams has provided non-singing (spoken word) contributions to some Temptation songs, including \\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\\" (1968, a hit duet with Diana Ross and Eddie Kendricks sharing the lead vocals), \\"I'm the Exception to the Rule\\", in which he shares leads with both Eddie Kendricks and Dennis Edwards, during the opening verse of \\"Masterpiece\\" (1973) and \\"For Your Love\\", which is done in a medley with \\"You Send Me\\" (led by Ali-Ollie Woodsen) on the For Lovers Only album (1995).

Historically the village was part of the Edeyrnion district of Meirionnydd. Edeyrnion was part of the Glynd≈µr district of Clwyd from 1974 to 1996, when the area became part of the principal area of Denbighshire. The village straddles the A494 road (trunk road). __TOC__ Etymology The name is often \\"poetically\\", but incorrectly, translated as The Irishman's Alder Grove. Gwyddel being Irishman, wern usually referring to a damp or swampy area arising from run-off from surrounding hills. However, the name is derived from gwyddeli, meaning thickets, hence the correct translation would be alder marsh in the thickets.Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales, Hywel Wyn Owen & Richard Morgan In colloquial speech the village is often referred to simply as Gwyddel. Geography The outlook to the west of the village is dominated by the hills Mynydd-Rh≈∑d-Ddu and Bryn Gwenallt. To the south the view extends over the Dee Valley to the Berwyn Mountains and Arenig Fawr near Bala. Besides farm work, local employers include a saw mill in the village and light manufacturing in Corwen and Cynwyd, further south. History Shield of the Lord of Gwyddelwern The nearby hamlet of Bryn Saith Marchog (), features in the story of Branwen, daughter of Llyr, part of the Mabinogion, and is so named after Bendigeidfran (Bran the Blessed), who stationed seven princes or knights there (the Saith Marchog) to watch over his lands while he was away in Ireland. The Lordship of Gwyddelwern was a junior title within the House of Powys Fadog and was recorded in 1400 as being held by Tudur ab Gruffydd Fychan II who was the younger brother of Owain Glynd≈µr. Tudur perished in battle during Glynd≈µr's war of independence and the title became dormant. In 1550, Gwyddelwern absorbed the neighboring parish of LlanaelhaiarnCoflein. \\"Capel Aelhaiarn, Chapel Site, Pandy'r Capel\\".

During the English Civil War a significant part of the village sided with the Royalist Cause - or at least enough people for the village to be required to give financial retribution. At the end of 1649 at least 20 men from the village were fined by the Parliamentarian side for \\"delinquency\\" to pay for their involvement fighting for the king. This included a heavy fine of ¬£28 for Peter Meyrick at Ucheldref Farm. Quarrying was important to Gwyddelwern: the two local quarries being the Dee Clwyd Granite Quarry and Graig Lelo Quarry. There is still activity at Graig Lelo, which plays host to a vehicle breakers and a granite and marble finishing business. =The Coming and Going of the Railways= Gwyddelwern became the first full-operational railway station in the Vale of Edeyrnion, when services started on 22 September 22, 1864 with the opening of the Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway. The station generated much income from the two quarries, which both had their own sidings. The station also had a coal yard, horse loading bay and cattle pens with a weighing machine. There was a freight loop at Gwyddelwern, on the otherwise single track line. Passenger services ended on 2 February 1953 and goods traffic on 2 December 1957. =Architecture= Gwyddelwern's historic architecture includes the much-rebuilt high spire of the parish church of St Beuno. The churchyard is circular, an indication of the age of the site, possibly to pre Christian times. Which shares a boundary with the local inn - T≈∑ Mawr, formerly the Rose and Crown. Parts of T≈∑ Mawr date back to the 11th century and, during extensive renovation, a rare jeton or 15th century gaming token was found in one of the wall spaces. References Dennis W.

Quantum error correction is essential if one is to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation that can deal not only with noise on stored quantum information, but also with faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum preparation, and faulty measurements. Classical error correction employs redundancy. The simplest way is to store the information multiple times, and‚Äîif these copies are later found to disagree‚Äîjust take a majority vote; e.g. suppose we copy a bit three times. Suppose further that a noisy error corrupts the three-bit state so that one bit is equal to zero but the other two are equal to one. If we assume that noisy errors are independent and occur with some probability p, it is most likely that the error is a single-bit error and the transmitted message is three ones. It is possible that a double-bit error occurs and the transmitted message is equal to three zeros, but this outcome is less likely than the above outcome. Copying quantum information is not possible due to the no- cloning theorem. This theorem seems to present an obstacle to formulating a theory of quantum error correction. But it is possible to spread the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of several (physical) qubits. Peter Shor first discovered this method of formulating a quantum error correcting code by storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of nine qubits. A quantum error correcting code protects quantum information against errors of a limited form. Classical error correcting codes use a syndrome measurement to diagnose which error corrupts an encoded state. We then reverse an error by applying a corrective operation based on the syndrome. Quantum error correction also employs syndrome measurements. We perform a multi-qubit measurement that does not disturb the quantum information in the encoded state but retrieves information about the error. A syndrome measurement can determine whether a qubit has been corrupted, and if so, which one. What is more, the outcome of this operation (the syndrome) tells us not only which physical qubit was affected, but also, in which of several possible ways it was affected. The latter is counter- intuitive at first sight: Since noise is arbitrary, how can the effect of noise be one of only few distinct possibilities? In most codes, the effect is either a bit flip, or a sign (of the phase) flip, or both (corresponding to the Pauli matrices X, Z, and Y). The reason is that the measurement of the syndrome has the projective effect of a quantum measurement. So even if the error due to the noise was arbitrary, it can be expressed as a superposition of basis operations‚Äîthe error basis (which is here given by the Pauli matrices and the identity). The syndrome measurement \\"forces\\" the qubit to \\"decide\\" for a certain specific \\"Pauli error\\" to \\"have happened\\", and the syndrome tells us which, so that we can let the same Pauli operator act again on the corrupted qubit to revert the effect of the error. The syndrome measurement tells us as much as possible about the error that has happened, but nothing at all about the value that is stored in the logical qubit‚Äîas otherwise the measurement would destroy any quantum superposition of this logical qubit with other qubits in the quantum computer. The bit flip code The repetition code works in a classical channel, because classical bits are easy to measure and to repeat. This stops being the case for a quantum channel in which, due to the no-cloning theorem, it is no longer possible to repeat a single qubit three times. To overcome this, a different method, such as the so-called three-qubit bit flip code, has to be used. This technique uses entanglement and syndrome measurements and is comparable in performance with the repetition code. Quantum circuit of the bit flip code Consider the situation in which we want to transmit the state of a single qubit \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\rangle through a noisy channel \\\\mathcal E. Let us moreover assume that this channel either flips the state of the qubit, with probability p, or leaves it unchanged. The action of \\\\mathcal E on a general input \\\\rho can therefore be written as \\\\mathcal E(\\\\rho) = (1-p) \\\\rho + p\\\\ X\\\\rho X. Let \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_00\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha_11\\\\rangle be the quantum state to be transmitted. With no error correcting protocol in place, the transmitted state will be correctly transmitted with probability 1-p. We can however improve on this number by encoding the state into a greater number of qubits, in such a way that errors in the corresponding logical qubits can be detected and corrected. In the case of the simple three-qubit repetition code, the encoding consists in the mappings \\\\vert0\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\vert0_L\\\\rangle\\\\equiv\\\\vert000\\\\rangle and \\\\vert1\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\vert1_L\\\\rangle\\\\equiv\\\\vert111\\\\rangle. The input state \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\rangle is encoded into the state \\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_0 \\\\vert000\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha_1 \\\\vert111\\\\rangle. This mapping can be realized for example using two CNOT gates, entangling the system with two ancillary qubits initialized in the state \\\\vert0\\\\rangle. The encoded state \\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle is what is now passed through the noisy channel. The channel acts on \\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle by flipping some subset (possibly empty) of its qubits. No qubit is flipped with probability (1-p)^3, a single qubit is flipped with probability 3p(1-p)^2, two qubits are flipped with probability 3p^2(1-p), and all three qubits are flipped with probability p^3. Note that a further assumption about the channel is made here: we assume that \\\\mathcal E acts equally and independently on each of the three qubits in which the state is now encoded. The problem is now how to detect and correct such errors, without at the same time corrupting the transmitted state. Comparison of output minimum fidelities, with (red) and without (blue) error correcting via the three qubit bit flip code. Notice how, for p\\\\le 1/2, the error correction scheme improves the fidelity. Let us assume for simplicity that p is small enough that the probability of more than a single qubit being flipped is negligible. One can then detect whether a qubit was flipped, without also querying for the values being transmitted, by asking whether one of the qubits differs from the others. This amounts to performing a measurement with four different outcomes, corresponding to the following four projective measurements:\\\\begin{align} P_0 &=000\\\\rangle\\\\langle000+111\\\\rangle\\\\langle111, \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_1 &=100\\\\rangle\\\\langle100+011\\\\rangle\\\\langle011, \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_2 &=010\\\\rangle\\\\langle010+101\\\\rangle\\\\langle101, \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_3 &=001\\\\rangle\\\\langle001+110\\\\rangle\\\\langle110. \\\\end{align}This can be achieved for example by measuring Z_1 Z_2 and then Z_2 Z_3. This reveals which qubits are different from which others, without at the same time giving information about the state of the qubits themselves. If the outcome corresponding to P_0 is obtained, no correction is applied, while if the outcome corresponding to P_i is observed, then the Pauli X gate is applied to the i-th qubit. Formally, this correcting procedure corresponds to the application of the following map to the output of the channel: \\\\mathcal E_{\\\\operatorname{corr}}(\\\\rho)=P_0\\\\rho P_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 X_i P_i \\\\rho\\\\, P_i X_i.Note that, while this procedure perfectly corrects the output when zero or one flips are introduced by the channel, if more than one qubit is flipped then the output is not properly corrected. For example, if the first and second qubits are flipped, then the syndrome measurement gives the outcome P_3, and the third qubit is flipped, instead of the first two. To assess the performance of this error correcting scheme for a general input we can study the fidelity F(\\\\psi') between the input \\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle and the output \\\\rho_{\\\\operatorname{out}}\\\\equiv\\\\mathcal E_{\\\\operatorname{corr}}(\\\\mathcal E(\\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi'\\\\vert)). Being the output state \\\\rho_{\\\\operatorname{out}} correct when no more than one qubit is flipped, which happens with probability (1-p)^3 + 3p(1-p)^2, we can write it as [(1-p)^3+3p(1-p)^2]\\\\,\\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi'\\\\vert + (...), where the dots denote components of \\\\rho_{\\\\operatorname{out}} resulting from errors not properly corrected by the protocol. It follows that F(\\\\psi')=\\\\langle\\\\psi'\\\\vert\\\\rho_{\\\\operatorname{out}}\\\\vert\\\\psi'\\\\rangle\\\\ge (1-p)^3 + 3p(1-p)^2=1-3p^2+2p^3.This Fidelity is to be compared with the corresponding fidelity obtained when no error correcting protocol is used, which was shown before to equal \\\\sqrt{1-p}. A little algebra then shows that the fidelity after error correction is greater than the one without for p<1/2. Note that this is consistent with the working assumption that was made while deriving the protocol (of p being small enough). The sign flip code Quantum circuit of the phase flip code Flipped bits are the only kind of error in classical computer, but there is another possibility of an error with quantum computers, the sign flip. Through the transmission in a channel the relative sign between 0\\\\rangle and 1\\\\rangle can become inverted. For instance, a qubit in the state -\\\\rangle=(0\\\\rangle-1\\\\rangle)/\\\\sqrt{2} may have its sign flip to +\\\\rangle=(0\\\\rangle+1\\\\rangle)/\\\\sqrt{2}. The original state of the qubit \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_0+\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_1-\\\\rangle will be changed into the state \\\\psi'\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_0{+}{+}{+}\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_1{-}{-}{-}\\\\rangle. In the Hadamard basis, bit flips become sign flips and sign flips become bit flips. Let E_\\\\text{phase} be a quantum channel that can cause at most one phase flip. Then the bit flip code from above can recover \\\\psi\\\\rangle by transforming into the Hadamard basis before and after transmission through E_\\\\text{phase}. The Shor code The error channel may induce either a bit flip, a sign flip (i.e., a phase flip), or both. It is possible to correct for both types of errors using one code, and the Shor code does just that. In fact, the Shor code corrects arbitrary single-qubit errors. Quantum circuit of the Shor code Let E be a quantum channel that can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. The 1st, 4th and 7th qubits are for the sign flip code, while the three group of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are designed for the bit flip code. With the Shor code, a qubit state \\\\psi\\\\rangle=\\\\alpha_00\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_11\\\\rangle will be transformed into the product of 9 qubits \\\\psi'\\\\rangle=\\\\alpha_00_S\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_11_S\\\\rangle, where : 0_S\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}(000\\\\rangle + 111\\\\rangle) \\\\otimes (000\\\\rangle + 111\\\\rangle ) \\\\otimes (000\\\\rangle + 111\\\\rangle) : 1_S\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{2}}(000\\\\rangle - 111\\\\rangle) \\\\otimes (000\\\\rangle - 111\\\\rangle) \\\\otimes (000\\\\rangle - 111\\\\rangle) If a bit flip error happens to a qubit, the syndrome analysis will be performed on each set of states (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9), then correct the error. If the three bit flip group (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are considered as three inputs, then the Shor code circuit can be reduced as a sign flip code. This means that the Shor code can also repair sign flip error for a single qubit. The Shor code also can correct for any arbitrary errors (both bit flip and sign flip) to a single qubit. If an error is modeled by a unitary transform U, which will act on a qubit \\\\psi\\\\rangle, then U can be described in the form : U=c_0I+c_1\\\\sigma_x+c_2\\\\sigma_y+c_3\\\\sigma_z where c_0,c_1,c_2, and c_3 are complex constants, I is the identity, and the Pauli matrices are given by : \\\\sigma_x=\\\\biggl( \\\\begin{matrix} 0&1\\\\\\\\\\\\1&0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\biggr); : \\\\sigma_y=\\\\biggl( \\\\begin{matrix} 0&-i\\\\\\\\\\\\i&0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\biggr); : \\\\sigma_z=\\\\biggl( \\\\begin{matrix} 1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&-1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\biggr) If U is equal to I, then no error occurs. If U=\\\\sigma_x, a bit flip error occurs. If U=\\\\sigma_z, a sign flip error occurs. If U=i\\\\sigma_y then both a bit flip error and a sign flip error occur. Due to linearity, it follows that the Shor code can correct arbitrary 1-qubit errors.  Bosonic codes  Several proposals have been made for storing error-correctable quantum information in bosonic modes. Unlike a two-level system, a quantum harmonic oscillator has infinitely many energy levels in a single physical system. Codes for these systems include cat, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP), and binomial codes. One insight offered by these codes is to take advantage of the redundancy within a single system, rather than to duplicate many two-level qubits. Written in the Fock basis, the simplest binomial encoding is 0_L\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{0\\\\rangle+4\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}},\\\\quad 1_L\\\\rangle=2\\\\rangle, where the subscript L indicates a \\"logically encoded\\" state. Then if the dominant error mechanism of the system is the stochastic application of the bosonic lowering operator \\\\hat{a}, the corresponding error states are 3\\\\rangle and 1\\\\rangle, respectively. Since the codewords involve only even photon number, and the error states involve only odd photon number, errors can be detected by measuring the photon number parity of the system. Measuring the odd parity will allow correction by application of an appropriate unitary operation without knowledge of the specific logical state of the qubit. However, the particular binomial code above is not robust to two-photon loss. General codes In general, a quantum code for a quantum channel \\\\mathcal{E} is a subspace \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{H}, where \\\\mathcal{H} is the state Hilbert space, such that there exists another quantum channel \\\\mathcal{R} with (\\\\mathcal{R} \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{E})(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\rho = P_{\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\rho P_{\\\\mathcal{C}}, where P_{\\\\mathcal{C}} is the orthogonal projection onto \\\\mathcal{C}. Here \\\\mathcal{R} is known as the correction operation. A non-degenerate code is one for which different elements of the set of correctable errors produce linearly independent results when applied to elements of the code. If distinct of the set of correctable errors produce orthogonal results, the code is considered pure. Models Over time, researchers have come up with several codes: * Peter Shor's 9-qubit-code, a.k.a. the Shor code, encodes 1 logical qubit in 9 physical qubits and can correct for arbitrary errors in a single qubit. * Andrew Steane found a code which does the same with 7 instead of 9 qubits, see Steane code. * Raymond Laflamme and collaborators found a class of 5-qubit codes which do the same, which also have the property of being fault-tolerant. A 5-qubit code is the smallest possible code which protects a single logical qubit against single-qubit errors. * A generalisation of this concept are the CSS codes, named for their inventors: A. R. Calderbank, Peter Shor and Andrew Steane. According to the quantum Hamming bound, encoding a single logical qubit and providing for arbitrary error correction in a single qubit requires a minimum of 5 physical qubits. * A more general class of codes (encompassing the former) are the stabilizer codes discovered by Daniel Gottesman (), and by A. R. Calderbank, Eric Rains, Peter Shor, and N. J. A. Sloane (, ); these are also called additive codes. *Two dimensional Bacon-Shor codes are a family of codes parameterized by integers m and n. There are nm qubits arranged in a square lattice. * A newer idea is Alexei Kitaev's topological quantum codes and the more general idea of a topological quantum computer. * Todd Brun, Igor Devetak, and Min-Hsiu Hsieh also constructed the entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism as an extension of the standard stabilizer formalism that incorporates quantum entanglement shared between a sender and a receiver. That these codes allow indeed for quantum computations of arbitrary length is the content of the quantum threshold theorem, found by Michael Ben-Or and Dorit Aharonov, which asserts that you can correct for all errors if you concatenate quantum codes such as the CSS codes‚Äîi.e. re-encode each logical qubit by the same code again, and so on, on logarithmically many levels‚Äîprovided the error rate of individual quantum gates is below a certain threshold; as otherwise, the attempts to measure the syndrome and correct the errors would introduce more new errors than they correct for. As of late 2004, estimates for this threshold indicate that it could be as high as 1-3%, provided that there are sufficiently many qubits available. Experimental realization There have been several experimental realizations of CSS-based codes. The first demonstration was with NMR qubits. Subsequently, demonstrations have been made with linear optics, trapped ions, and superconducting (transmon) qubits. In 2016 for the first time the lifetime of a quantum bit was prolonged by employing a QEC code. The error-correction demonstration was performed on Schrodinger-cat states encoded in a superconducting resonator, and employed a quantum controller capable of performing real-time feedback operations including read-out of the quantum information, its analysis, and the correction of its detected errors. The work demonstrated how the quantum- error-corrected system reaches the break-even point at which the lifetime of a logical qubit exceeds the lifetime of the underlying constituents of the system (the physical qubits). Other error correcting codes have also been implemented, such as one aimed at correcting for photon loss, the dominant error source in photonic qubit schemes.

The investigation began in February 2002 and the final report was released in December 2002. Calls for inquiry The White House, Senator Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and Representative Porter Goss (R-Fla.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, originally rebuffed calls for an inquiry following the September 11 attacks. After December 2001, initial resolutions in the Senate called for the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission. The Joint Inquiry was announced February 14, 2002 with Senator Graham saying it would not play \\"the blame game about what went wrong from an intelligence perspective\\", and Representative Goss saying, \\"This particular effort focuses on the broader issues of terrorism worldwide, our capacity to counter terrorist activities and our preparedness to protect the American people at home and abroad.\\"Press Release of Intelligence Committee , Senate and House Intelligence Committees Announce Joint Inquiry into the September 11th Terrorist Attacks, February 14, 2002. Investigation Senator Graham and Representative Goss, accompanied by their respective committee ranking minority members, Republican Senator Richard C. Shelby and Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi, led the joint inquiry. L. Britt Snider, the former inspector general of the CIA, was staff director. He hired a 30-person investigative staff to gather evidence and interview Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence and law enforcement agencies.Greg Miller, Leader of 9/11 Probe Resigns Suddenly , Los Angeles Times, April 30, 2002. However, the committee quickly ran into stonewalling, delays and attacks from Vice President Dick Cheney and United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, especially after an alleged leak from the committee. CNN had reported classified information that the National Security Agency had received warning of the attacks on September 10th but failed to translate and forward them.Athan G. Theoharis, editor, The Central Intelligence Agency: Security Under Scrutiny, Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 222-224 , 2006, Staff director L. Britt Snider was pressured to resign in April 2002 because of questions about whether one or more of his hires had lacked proper clearance to view classified material. The Washington Post reported in May 2002 that Senator Goss dismissed as \\"a lot of nonsense\\" reports that five weeks before the attacks a CIA briefing had alerted President Bush about possible Osama bin Laden associates' plans to highjack aircraft; he said the investigation focus would be on why the United State intelligence bureaucracy composed of 13 agencies failed to detect the hijackers. Senator Graham said the question was why wasn't the intelligence precise. Critics on and off of Capitol Hill complained that Goss was too aligned with the CIA and Graham was insufficiently assertive.Richard Leiby, A Cloak But No Dagger; An Ex-Spy Says He Seeks Solutions, Not Scapegoats for 9/11 , Washington Post, May 18, 2002. In August 2002 unnamed individuals who had read the report revealed it contained accusations of links between the government of Saudi Arabia and the attacks. The Saudis denied this and asked that the section be made public, but President Bush refused.James Risen and David Johnston, Report on 9/11 Suggests a Role By Saudi Spies , Washington Post, August 2, 2003. In December 2002 Senator Graham himself revealed in a PBS interview that \\"I was surprised at the evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States.\\"Improving Intelligence , PBS interview with Sen. Bob Graham, December 11, 2002. The report The joint inquiry released their findings in December 2002. The 832 page report (available as both S. Rept. 107-351 and H. Rept. 107-792) presents the joint inquiry‚Äôs findings and conclusions, an accompanying narrative, and a series of recommendations. The critical and comprehensive report detailed failings of the FBI and CIA to use available information, including about terrorists the CIA knew were in the United States, in order to disrupt the plots. =Redacted sections= The 28 Pages refer to a small section at the end of the inquiry commission report on the 9/11 attacks which includes the details of foreign state sponsor support for Al-Qaeda prior to the attack and the possible Saudi connection with the terrorists. This part of the congressional report was classified by the George W. Bush administration. Since then, attempts were made to declassify the redacted pages by senators and political activists, among them former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the co-chairman of the joint congressional panel, Bob Graham. United States' intelligence agencies declassified the pages, and Congress publicly released the pages with some parts redacted on July 15, 2016. Aftermath September 11th victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material and demanded an independent commission. In late 2002 President Bush and congress established the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, an independent bipartisan commission popularly known as the \\"9/11 Commission\\". In 2004 Senator Graham released his book Intelligence Matters: The CIA, the FBI, Saudi Arabia, and the Failure of America's War on Terror which dealt with issues raised by the investigation.Bob Graham, with Jeff Nussbaum, Intelligence Matters: The CIA, the FBI, Saudi Arabia, and the Failure of America's War on Terror, Random House], 2004, Interview: Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, discusses his theory about a Saudi link to 9/11, NPR, September 9, 2004. In April 2016, both co-chairmen of the Inquiry, Bob Graham and Porter Goss, later director of the CIA, as well as other former U.S. officials, who are familiar with the entire text of the Joint Inquiry‚Ä≤s report, aired their belief that the U.S. government was persisting in its coverup on the Saudi Arabian government officials‚Ä≤ substantial aid provided to the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack and urged the Obama administration to declassify the bowdlerized pages of the report. A bipartisan effort led by Walter Jones and Stephen Lynch seeks to make the document fully available to the public. Questions are likely to persist even if the \\"28 pages\\" are released. In 2015, efforts began in the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that would allow victims to sue foreign powers that fund terrorist groups, such as Al Qaeda, to kill Americans on American soil. This bill became law on September 28, 2016 as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. References External links * S. Hrg. 107‚Äì1086, Volume 1.

He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder for the Chicago Cubs (1912‚Äì17) and Philadelphia Phillies (1918‚Äì30). As Major League Baseball emerged from the dead-ball era, Williams became one of the most prominent home run hitters in the National League. Baseball career Born in Wadena, Indiana, Williams attended Notre Dame where he studied architecture and played football with Knute Rockne. His hitting prowess caught the attention of the Chicago Cubs, who purchased his contract after he graduated from college. Williams made his major league debut with the Cubs on July 18, 1912 at the age of 24. From 1915 to 1927 he was a consistent power hitting center fielder, leading the National League in home runs four times during his career. Williams was the first National League player to hit 200 career home runs, and is one of three players born before 1900 to hit 200 homers in his career (Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby are the others). He was the National League's career home run leader until his record of 251 was surpassed by Hornsby in 1929. In a 19-year major league career, Williams played in 2,002 games, accumulating 1,981 hits in 6,780 at bats for a .292 career batting average along with 251 home runs, 1,005 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .365. He hit over .300 six times in his career. An excellent defensive player, Williams had a .973 career fielding percentage, which was nine points higher than the league average during his playing career. The Williams Shift, in which defensive players moved to the right side of the playing field, is often associated with Ted Williams, but it was actually first employed against Cy Williams during the 1920s. He played in his final major league game on September 22, 1930 at the age of 42. In 1931, Williams served as a player-manager in the minor leagues for the Richmond Byrds of the Eastern League. Later life After retirement, Williams worked as an architect at the 3 Lakes Theatre in Three Lakes, Wisconsin since 1949. Before that, he designed the 3 Lakes Theatre's exterior and interior and later opened that June of the same year.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/30036 See also * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle * Major League Baseball titles leaders References External links , or Retrosheet * * Category:1887 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:National League home run champions Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Richmond Byrds players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's track and field athletes Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:People from Benton County, Indiana Category:People from Three Lakes, Wisconsin ","title":"Cy Williams"},{"id":"892817","title":"Helijet"},{"id":"892819","text":"Intercity Shopping Centre is a shopping mall in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.

The artist lived and worked in Seven Hills, Ohio with his wife, the sculptor Barbara Stanczak.  Biography  Julian Stanczak was born in Borownica, Poland in 1928. At the beginning of World War II, Stanczak was forced into a Siberian labor camp, where he permanently lost the use of his right arm. He had been right-handed. In 1942, aged thirteen, Stanczak escaped from Siberia to join the Anders' Army in Persia. After deserting from the army, he spent his teenage years in a hut in a Polish refugee camp in Uganda. In Africa, Stanczak learned to write and paint left-handed. He then spent some years in London, before moving to the United States in 1950. He settled in Cleveland, Ohio. He became a United States citizen in 1957, taught at the Cincinnati Academy of Art for 7 years. In 2007, Stanczak was interviewed by Brian Sherwin for Myartspace. During the interview, Stanczak recalled his experiences with war and the loss of his right arm and how both influenced his art. Stanczak explained, \\"The transition from using my left hand as my right, main hand, was very difficult. My youthful experiences with the atrocities of the Second World War are with me,- but I wanted to forget them and live a \\"normal\\" life and adapt into society more fully. In the search for Art, you have to separate what is emotional and what is logical. I did not want to be bombarded daily by the past,- I looked for anonymity of actions through non-referential, abstract art.\\" \\"Art Space Talk: Julian Stanczak\\" , Myartspace, 23 July 2007. Retrieved 15 July 2008. Education Stanczak received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Cleveland Institute of Art, Cleveland Ohio in 1954, and then trained under Josef Albers and Conrad Marca- Relli at the Yale University, School of Art and Architecture where he received his Master of Fine Arts in 1956. Works The Op Art movement was named after his first major show, Julian Stanczak: Optical Paintings, held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York in 1964. His work was included in the Museum of Modern Art's 1965 exhibition The Responsive Eye. In 1966 he was named a \\"New Talent\\" by Art in America magazine. In the early 1960s he began to make the surface plane of the painting vibrate through his use of wavy lines and contrasting colors in works such as Provocative Current (1965). These paintings gave way to more complex compositions constructed with geometric rigidity yet softened with varying degrees of color transparency such as Netted Green (1972). In addition to being an artist, Stanczak was also a teacher, having worked at the Art Academy of Cincinnati from 1957‚Äì64 and as Professor of Painting, at the Cleveland Institute of Art, 1964-1995. He was named \\"Outstanding American Educator\\" by the Educators of America in 1970. Style Stanczak deployed repeating forms to create compositions that are manifestations of his visual experiences. Stanczak's work is an art of experience, and is based upon structures of color. In the 1980s and 1990s Stanczak retained his geometric structure and created compositions with bright or muted colors, often creating pieces in a series such as Soft Continuum (1981; Johnson and Johnson Co. CT, see McClelland pl. 50). More recently, Stanczak created large-scale series, consisting of square panels upon which he examined variations of hue and chroma in illusionistic color modulations, an example of which is Windows to the Past (2000; 50 panels).

It is a subsidiary of News Corp Australia, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. It primarily serves Darwin and the rest of the Northern Territory. It covers local, national, and world news as well as sports and business. The paper currently has a Monday to Friday readership average of 47,000, reaching an average of 55,000 on Saturdays. News Corp Australia also publishes its local counterpart, The Sunday Territorian, which is also available throughout Darwin and the Northern Territory, as well as free weekly community newspapers (since December 2008) under the banner of Sun Newspapers (delivered in Darwin, Palmerston, and Litchfield). History The first edition of the Northern Territory News was published on 8 February 1952, as a weekly tabloid, then twice weekly, building up to five days a week in 1964. In February 1975 publication reverted to five afternoons a week. The Saturday edition started again in 1979 and now all six papers are morning dailies. The Northern Territory News was founded as a counterbalance to perceived pro- communist bias from the Northern Territory's only newspaper at the time the trade union owned The Northern Standard which soon folded. Originally the paper was quite politically active being a noted advocate of greater self- governance powers for the Northern Territory as well as being vocal on a number of other local issues. However, the paper gradually lapsed into the current apolitical stance it maintains presently with its most noted feature being its often colourful headlines and front pages. The paper has become well known around Australia for its front-page headlines with then-Deputy Editor Paul Dyer winning a Walkley Award for his contributions in 2012. A book, What A Croc, featuring the paper's most popular front pages was released in 2014.

Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, she was first introduced in the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII as a young female ninja princess and thief. She can become one of the game's player characters after finishing a special sidequest. Yuffie reappears in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII series, expanding her background and showing her after the events of the original game. Yuffie has further been featured in other Square Enix games, most notably the Kingdom Hearts crossover series, voiced by Yumi Kakazu in the Japanese versions of the games. In the English versions, Christy Carlson Romano provides her voice for Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, and Mae Whitman is Yuffie's voice for Kingdom Hearts II, Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII and Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind. The character has achieved a high level of popularity in Japan, but the English-language media reception has been more mixed. Appearances =Final Fantasy VII= One of two secret characters in the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie is a 16-year-old ninja and a thief who fights with oversized shuriken that she can throw like a boomerang. A fiercely patriotic daughter of , the leader of , a culture based on real-world East Asia, Yuffie feels her country has lost its former glory and become nothing more than a resort town. After losing the war against Shinra Electric Power Company, Godo began to turn Wutai into a tourist attraction. This did not suit Yuffie, who began running off, stealing the magical Materia from unaware travelers in hope to someday become strong enough to change this situation. Sneaky and arrogant,Final Fantasy VII PC special edition official website (Characters section). Yuffie has a tomboyish and charismatic personality and obsessively steals and collects Materia. She also tends to be short-tempered and is prone to motion sickness. Gameplay-wise, Yuffie possesses the special Materia \\"Throw\\", enabling her to throw almost any item from the player's inventory at enemies during combat, and when leveled up, the ability \\"Coin\\" becomes available, allowing her to throw the party's Gil currency at the enemy. Yuffie is introduced when she ambushes the protagonist Cloud Strife and his allies in either the Gongaga jungle or the forests south of Junon, appearing as \\"Mystery Ninja\\". If the player defeats her in combat and then chooses the correct series of dialogue choices, she introduces herself and joins the player's party as one of player characters. However, once in Wutai Village, Yuffie steals the party's Materia and hides, but is kidnapped by a Midgar crime lord, the lecherous Don Corneo. When the group rescues Yuffie, she returns the stolen Materia and continues working with the party. In another sidequest, she proves herself by fighting the bosses of Wutai's five story pagoda, the last of these battles against Godo. These fights, and the sequence of conversations following, enable both father and daughter to understand the other's actions and to come to a mutual respect. At Godo's request, Cloud officially takes Yuffie (who obtains her level 4 Limit Break special attack, called \\"All Creation\\"William Irwin, Jason P. Blahuta, Michel S. Beaulieu, Final Fantasy and Philosophy: The Ultimate Walkthrough ().) with him on his quest. If Yuffie is present at the end of disc one, when Aerith Gainsborough is murdered by the party's nemesis Sephiroth, the player can witness an uncharacteristic display of emotion from the character, as she breaks down in Cloud's arms after failing to control her sobs. Yuffie's loyalty to the team is called into question after Cloud temporarily disbands his party ahead of their final confrontation with Sephiroth; when Yuffie is the last to return Barret Wallace suspects her of abandoning the team in light of her earlier treachery at Wutai. When Yuffie returns to the group she subsequently rebukes Barrett for his judgement. =Compilation of Final Fantasy VII= Yuffie as seen in the CGI animated film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children In the 2005 computer animated film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Yuffie reunites with her Final Fantasy VII allies to fight against the summon creature Bahamut SIN.

After meeting Zack Fair, she enlists his help to find treasures in several side missions. =Other appearances= Outside the Final Fantasy series, Yuffie has also been featured in the Kingdom Hearts series since 2002. In the first Kingdom Hearts, a younger Yuffie acts as a supporting character in Traverse Town, helping to defeat the Heartless who had destroyed her world. Yuffie's appearance in 2004's Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a projection from Sora's memories in Traverse Town. In 2005's Kingdom Hearts II, she aids Leon and the others as part of the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee, this time appearing in her Advent Children attire. In both Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, Yuffie is additionally featured as an opponent in the Olympus Coliseum, while 2008's Kingdom Hearts coded features a virtual simulation of Yuffie. She also appears in the manga adaptations of Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts II and Chain of Memories published by Gangan Comics and Tokyopop.

Her theme music in Final Fantasy VII, \\"Descendant of Shinobi\\", is included in a vocal form on the album Final Fantasy Song Book: Mahoroba as \\"Walking in the Road, After the Rain\\" by Nobuo Uematsu and Yuji Hasegawa. Creation and development During the early development of Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie was envisioned as a 25-year-old ex-SOLDIER now working as a bounty hunter, seeking both the game's protagonist Cloud Strife and its antagonist Sephiroth, while to having a bounty on her own head. Her job class was originally listed as \\"ninja (assassin)\\" and she was intended to be a daughter of the long-deceased Kasumi Kisaragi. The Wutai sidequest present in the final incarnation of the game was significantly different.Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega p. 520 (Early Material File Character Files). Her age and description was different for each of the several wanted posters; what Yuffie looks like, as her level, is determined on the last wanted poster viewed. She would encounter the party in a random encounter, or attack Cloud when he is sleeping in an inn. The Wutai scenario required Yuffie to be recruited to complete it. Having a close attachment to Yuffie's character, Final Fantasy VII event planner Jun Akiyama was responsible for the large number of cutscenes featuring her and her actions during fights. Regarding the use of Japanese pronouns, Yuffie uses atashi \\"as opposed to the other female characters who use watashi, perhaps to make her sound more cute or youthful, as she is younger than the others.\\" Mae Whitman, who voiced Yuffie in the English versions of Kingdom Hearts II and Dirge of Cerberus, said she was not \\"aware of the extent to which people were familiar with her character already.\\" In a 2012 interview, Whitman recalled Yuffie as \\"bubbly and bright and nice. But still super cool!\\" Yuffie's design in Kingdom Hearts was partially based on the originally planned appearance of Rikku from Final Fantasy X. Reception An attendee of Comiket in 2009. Yuffie's character has become a noted cosplay favourite during the 2000s Yuffie Kisaragi has received a notably positive reception in Japan, having placed as the 42nd best PlayStation character in the 2007 \\"Den-Play Awards\\" by Dengeki PlayStation.

In a 2013 poll by Square Enix, Yuffie was voted the 14th most popular Final Fantasy female character, sharing that spot with Beatrix from Final Fantasy IX. Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) included \\"seeing Yuffie once again\\" as one of the greatest moments of Kingdom Hearts while giving it their Role-Playing Game of the Year 2002 award.Electronic Gaming Monthly issue 165 page 103. David Smith from IGN ranked Yuffie seventh on the 2008 list of top ten Final Fantasy VII characters, stating that she \\"belongs in the Wacky Sidekicks wing of the RPG hall of fame;\\" although commenting that Yuffie can sometimes be \\"a pain in the neck,\\" Smith said that she became such an appealing sidekick character that Square would go on to use the \\"Yuffie formula\\" with Rikku for Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy VII director Yoshinori Kitase asked EGM \\"why American gamers love Yuffie so much.\\" They were unable to come with a clear answer. According to Edge, Yuffie, being one of characters that are \\"brands in and of themselves\\", \\"created a new anime stereotype -- the, uh, giddy girl ninja.\\" WomanGamers.com gave the character an overall score of 7.0/10, opining that while \\"a 16 year old ninja girl was a nice refreshing change [...] it would have been nice if her character had matured and developed through this story.\\"Ismini \\"Atari\\" Roby, Yuffie Kisaragi of Final Fantasy VII, WomenGamers.com, July 27, 1999 (archived). In 2012, Becky Cunningham of Cheat Code Central ranked her as the fourth top ninja in video games, stating that despite her \\"cocky, brash, and slightly abrasive personality,\\" Yuffie is \\"also a compassionate person with an impressive goal,\\" serving \\"as both comic relief and unlikely hero, a seemingly self-centered sneak thief who always does the right thing in the end.\\" In a 2014 poll by Spanish magazine Hobby Consolas, Yuffie was voted one of eight best ninja characters in video games.David Martinez, El gran desaf√≠o ninja: Round 3, Hobbyconsolas.com, 18 March 2014. M√°rcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed Yuffie at fifth spot on his 2014 list of top female ninja characters in games, commenting on her close resemblance to Makimachi Misao from Rurouni Kenshin. In 2012, Jef Rouner of the Houston Press listed Yuffie's reaction to Aerith's death as one of the five most \\"heartbreaking\\" missable scenes in the Final Fantasy franchise; which he felt rivalled the emotional impact of anything found in the main narrative. UGO.com featured her in the 2011 list of 25 most sexy ninja girls in all media for her appearance in Advent Children, adding \\"that third- dimension certainly adds something.\\"25 Hot Ninja Girls - Hot Women Ninjas , UGO.com, January 5, 2011.

She was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with influence from Yoshinori Kitase, Hironobu Sakaguchi and Yoshitaka Amano. The Lead Heroine of Final Fantasy VII, she is a young woman who joins the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. As the story progresses, AVALANCHE begin to pursue the game's antagonist Sephiroth, and the player learns that she is the last surviving Cetra, or \\"Ancient\\", one of the planet's oldest races. She has also appeared in the later-released Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and Kingdom Hearts series. Her voice actor is Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. In English releases, her voice actors are singer and actress Mandy Moore in Kingdom Hearts, actress Mena Suvari in Kingdom Hearts II and Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, actress Andrea Bowen in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, as well as the Re Mind DLC of Kingdom Hearts III and actress Briana White in Final Fantasy VII Remake. The character and the events surrounding her death in Final Fantasy VII have met with an overall positive reception from critics and fans. Appearances =Final Fantasy VII= Aerith Gainsborough is first introduced as a flower seller, when she briefly converses with Cloud Strife, a mercenary working for the anti-government group AVALANCHE, who are fleeing from the bombing of a Mako reactor. The two later meet in Aerith's church in the Sector 5 slums, where she is faced with the possibility of capture by the Turks. Aerith asks Cloud to be her bodyguard for the cost of one date. She is eventually apprehended, but is ultimately rescued by Cloud and his allies. Aerith then joins them in the pursuit of Sephiroth, while also embarking on her own journey of self-discovery. After a failed attempt to foil Sephiroth's theft of the Black Materia, Aerith ventures alone into the Forgotten City. Cloud and his companions give chase, eventually finding her praying at an altar. As Aerith looks up to smile at Cloud, Sephiroth appears and kills her by impaling her through the torso. Cloud carries Aerith's body out into a lake in the Forgotten City, and releases her back to the Planet. Reeve Tuesti, the head of Shinra Urban and Development, brings the news of her death to Elmyra Gainsborough, Aerith's adoptive mother. The party later learns the reason for Aerith being in the Forgotten City; through her White Materia, Aerith was able to summon Holy, the only force capable of repelling the ultimate destructive magic, Meteor, which has been summoned by Sephiroth.Bugenhagen: It says, when the time comes, we must search for \\"Holy\\". / Cloud: Holy? / Bugenhagen: Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor. Cloud: Aerith has already prayed for Holy. ... She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... And to do that, there was a secret here... That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. Although Aerith successfully cast Holy before her death, it is held back by the power of Sephiroth's will. When Sephiroth is finally defeated and Holy is released, it appears that it is too late to function as effectively as it should, as Meteor has already come too near to the Planet's surface. While Holy clashes with Meteor, attempting to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and the Planet pulling on Holy in opposite directions weakens it. Aerith is seen praying with both hands interlocked whilst urging the lifestream to ultimately defend the planet. The Planet's Lifestream then flows forth, intervening between Holy and Meteor, and acting as a battering ram while aiding in the destruction of Meteor. =Compilation of Final Fantasy VII= In Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, set several years prior to the events of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith becomes the target of the original incarnation of AVALANCHE, led by Elf√©, who seek to prevent Shinra from acquiring the last surviving Cetra. Instead, AVALANCHE intend to use her to learn the whereabouts of the Promised Land for their own purposes, although a member of the Turks tries to protect her. Aerith makes several appearances in the CGI film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him to move on with his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support.Aerith: So, why did you come? / Cloud: I think ... I want to be forgiven, more than anything. / ... / Cloud: But... I let you die... / Aerith: Dilly dally, shilly shally. Isn't it time you did the forgiving? / ... / Aerith: I never blamed you, not once. You came for me, that's all that matters. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She appears again in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light.Aerith: You see? Everything's all right. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma. The On the Way to a Smile novella \\"Case of the Lifestream ‚Äì Black & White\\" focuses on Aerith and Sephiroth's respective journeys through the Lifestream after the end of the game but before the events of the film. The \\"Black\\" section deals with Sephiroth, the \\"White\\" section with Aerith. Aerith appears in the prequel game Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. At the age of 16, she meets Zack, for whom she develops feelings during his stay in Midgar.Aerith: What a shock..... I didn't know Zack was from this town. / Cloud: You know him? / Aerith: Didn't I tell you? He was my first love. Aerith and Zack develop a romantic relationship, but Zack is killed at the end of Crisis Core after being held in a Mako chamber for four years in the Shinra Mansion basement. During those years, Aerith helped her adopted mother earn a living by growing and selling flowers, a job that results in her meeting Cloud at the beginning of Final Fantasy VII. =Other appearances= Aerith's character has appeared in several games outside of the Final Fantasy VII continuity. In Final Fantasy Tactics, she appears as a flower girl;Town Knave: I've been looking for you, Aeris... Selling flowers for your mom? Good for you... when a group of criminals harasses her, Cloud appears and the player engages in battle with the group, letting her escape. Itadaki Street Special features a playable version of Aerith, as well as other Final Fantasy VII characters Tifa Lockhart, Cloud Strife, and Sephiroth. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable with the same characters from Special, with the addition of Yuffie Kisaragi. While not playable, Aerith appears in the fighting game Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy as an assistant character. She is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a sub-character representing Final Fantasy VII. In LittleBigPlanet 2, Aerith is featured as a downloadable character model. Aerith makes an appearance in the Kingdom Hearts series as a member of a group dedicated to defeating the Heartless; the group also includes other Final Fantasy VII characters and Leon of Final Fantasy VIII. In the plot of Kingdom Hearts, Aerith suggests a method for defeating the Heartless to protagonists Donald Duck, Goofy and Sora, and gives advice to the player throughout the game. She also appears in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories as a perceptive figment of Sora's memories.Aerith: We don't know you, Sora, but your heart is full of memories of us together. Those memories must resonate in our hearts, too. Maybe they tell us things we couldn't otherwise know. / Leon: So you're saying that Sora's memories are affecting ours? / Aerith: His memories do seem to have a certain power. / Sora: Maybe it's like that guy said, then. This town is just an illusion. Something my memories created. Aerith returns in Kingdom Hearts II, wearing a modified version of her dress from Before Crisis. She, Leon and Yuffie run a restoration committee for the town of Hollow Bastion. Aerith once again makes an appearance in a Kingdom Hearts III expansion. Hoshi o Meguru Otome (Maiden who Travels the Planet), a novel written by Benny Matsuyama which appears in the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Œ© guide, follows Aerith's journey through the Lifestream immediately after her death in Final Fantasy VII. Aerith is mentioned in a graffiti in the subway station early in the animated film Wreck-It Ralph; the graffiti reads \\"Aerith Lives\\". Concept and creation Aerith was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which too helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress was designed to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith was supposed to be Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair. Her green eyes were meant to symbolize nature and also served as another contrast to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also used as the basis for her design in Kingdom Hearts II. Aerith's original Japanese name is „Ç®„Ç¢„É™„Çπ Earisu, . This was transliterated to \\"Aeris\\" in Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics, but in later products has been changed to \\"Aerith\\". Both transliterations have basis, as the Japanese \\"su\\" („Çπ) is used when transcribing \\"s\\" () and \\"th\\" () to Japanese. However, official Japanese material uses the spelling \\"Aerith\\",Final Fantasy VII instruction manual, CharactersV Jump Final Fantasy VII the PerfectFinal Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania and developers have stated that \\"Aerith\\" is a near- anagram of \\"Earth\\". Prior to the game's release, Western gaming magazines, such as the May 1996 issue of Computer and Video Games, also referred to her as \\"Aerith\\". In early planning stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith was to be one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: \\"Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious.\\" While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the \\"perennial clich√© where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love.\\" He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked \\"Is it right to set such an example to people?\\" (abridged online edition) Kitase concluded: \\"In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood.\\" According to Nomura, \\"death should be something sudden and unexpected, and Aerith's death seemed more natural and realistic.\\" He said: \\"When I reflect on Final Fantasy VII, the fact that fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character.\\" From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true; \\"the world was expecting us to bring her back to life, as this is the classic convention.\\" A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that \\"there are many meanings in Aerith's death and [her revival] could never happen.\\" Mena Suvari explained that for Advent Children Aerith was given a mothering feel with an ephemeral presence. She was expressed joy for her role. With regards to the Remake, Square wanted to avoid showing too much favoritism to either girl in their love triangle with the main character Cloud. Briana White studied Sakamoto's acting in order to appeal to fans. Musical theme VGL performance in 2009 A leitmotif associated with Aerith is played several times throughout Final Fantasy VII; it is first heard during the flashback scenes with Aerith's mother at her house, and is repeated as she is killed by Sephiroth. It was composed by Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. The piece \\"Flowers Blooming in the Church\\" is based on it. \\"Aerith's Theme\\" is very popular among Final Fantasy fans, and has inspired an orchestral version, a piano version, and a vocal version performed by the artist Rikki (who also performed \\"Suteki Da Ne\\" for Final Fantasy X). A piano arrangement of the theme appears twice in Advent Children, and the track \\"Water\\" echoes shades of the theme: the opening phrase of \\"Aerith's Theme\\" appears just prior to the climax of the track \\"Divinity II\\", which shortly thereafter includes as its final line the Latin phrase \\"Sola Dea fatum novit\\" (\\"Only the goddess knows fate\\"), and is also featured during the end credits of the film. It has been reinterpreted on the OverClocked ReMix Final Fantasy VII compilation Voices of the Lifestream. In 2013, \\"Aerith's Theme\\" achieved the third place in the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Reception =General= Aerith has received an overall positive reception from critics. GamesTM referred to her as a \\"gaming legend.\\" RPGamer's Stuart Hoggan opined that although Aerith \\"represented the token damsel in distress,\\" she \\"broke the mould in terms of personality,\\" possessing \\"an admirable pluck that was not brassy nor off-putting.\\" In 2007, she was included in Tom's Games list of top 50 greatest female characters in video game history, for her death scene and the beauty of her appearance and personality. That same year, she was named the fifth best character of all time in Dengeki PlayStations retrospective awards feature about the original PlayStation. IGN ranked her the number two in their top Final Fantasy VII character list ‚Äì a rank higher than the game's protagonist, Cloud Strife. GameTrailers ranked her at the top of their list of \\"babes who are out of your league\\" in 2010. Heath Hooker of GameZone ranked Aerith as fifth on his 2012 top list of Final Fantasy characters and wrote she \\"has become an icon in not only the Final Fantasy series, but also in video game history.\\" Her relation with Cloud too has received positive response, including the two being listed in IGN's article about the best video game romances. The character is popular among gamers, especially Japanese and fans of the Final Fantasy series. Aerith has been included in most of GameFAQs' \\"Character Battle\\" contests, though she progressed only a few rounds each time. In 2010, Famitsu readers voted Aerith as the 24th best video game character. In 2013, Aerith was voted the second favorite female Final Fantasy character in an official poll by Square Enix. That same year, Complex ranked her as the seventh greatest Final Fantasy character of all time. In 2020, the Japanese broadcaster NHK concluded their global but Japan-focused poll for all Final Fantasy titles. Among characters Aerith ranked in third place, behind a first place Cloud and a second place Yuna from Final Fantasy X. Thus making Aerith the second most popular female and Final Fantasy VII character respectively.https://www.nhk.or.jp/anime/ff/ranking/?cat=chara The character's traits in the remake were praised by Siliconera due to how caring she is and how developed she becomes across the narrative. Despite criticizing for not doing wrong things that balance her, Siliconera still enjoyed the scene where she volunteers for Don Corneo. Nevertheless, the site enjoyed how enigmatic she is for the way she interacts with the members from the cast. =Death= alt=A brown-haired girl in a pink dress is stabbed in the back by a white- haired man wearing black clothing. Aerith's death in Final Fantasy VII has received a great deal of attention. According to GamesTM, her death helped establish the popularity of Final Fantasy VII. Players commented on message boards and blogs about the emotional impact the scene held. Fans submitted a petition to Yoshinori Kitase requesting her return. GameSpy numbers her demise as the 10th greatest cinematic moments in video game history, while its readers voted it the second most cinematic moment. GamePro considers her death sequence to be the greatest of all gaming moments. Tom's Games called the scene \\"one of the most powerful and memorable scenes of the Final Fantasy series‚Äîor any other game, for that matter.\\" Edge called her death the \\"dramatic highpoint\\" of Final Fantasy VII, and suggested that reintroducing her through the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles \\"arguably undermines this great moment.\\" In 2005, Electronic Gaming Monthly listed Final Fantasy VII number six in their list of ten most important games, stating that without this game, \\"Aeris wouldn't have died, and gamers wouldn't have learned how to cry.\\" ScrewAttack has added Aerith's death to their top 10 \\"OMGWTF\\" moments, referring to it as one of the \\"touchiest moments in video game history.\\" In 2011, IGN ranked her death scene at No. 1 in its list of top video game moments. In 2012, PlayStation Magazine included it among the ten most emotional PlayStation moments. Said death has also been cited as the defining moment of a star-crossed love story, between her and main character Cloud Strife.Danesi (2013) Brian Taylor, writing for Kill Screen, described a cottage industry of fan theories for how to return Aerith to life or prevent her death. He compared these efforts to the letter-writing campaign to convince Charles Dickens not to let Nell, the endearing protagonist of The Old Curiosity Shop, die at the end of the book. Taylor affirmed that the acts of discussing these fan theories and dissecting the game code to test them comprise a valid and important part of the experience of the game.

It is one of the largest parishes in the county, and includes the villages of Ilsington, Haytor Vale, Liverton and South Knighton. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Bovey Tracey, Teigngrace (a short border only), Newton Abbot, Ogwell (another short border), Bickington, Ashburton, Widecombe- in-the-Moor and Manaton. In 2001 the population of the parish was 2,444, greatly increased from the 886 residents recorded in 1901. The parish is represented in parliament by Mel Stride, as part of the Central Devon constituency. History The village is believed to be an ancient settlement - probably existing 200 to 300 years before the Norman Conquest. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Ilestintona, and there is known to have been a church there since at least the 11th century. St. Michael's parish church, as seen today, dates back to the 15th century. It was the site of an incident which has passed into local folklore: in 1639 the schoolroom, which was above the west lychgate of the church, collapsed into the street and churchyard. The Haytor quarries Apart from its agricultural history, Ilsington's industrial archaeology reflects the mining of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Atlas tin mine and the Smallacombe iron mine were major local enterprises ‚Äì with the cottages at Lewthorne Cross being built for William Grose, the mine captain and mine workers. Nearby, at Haytor, granite was quarried and carried down to the Stover Canal at Ventiford, Teigngrace, on the Haytor Granite Tramway, the route of which is now commemorated in the Templer Way footpath. Haytor granite was used in the building of many civic structures including London Bridge, over the Thames in London. Through the centuries, Ilsington village appears to have been largely self-supporting. Census returns and church records show a variety of rural occupations among the local community including farmers, blacksmiths, carpenters, thatchers and stone workers. It had an ancient manor house which fell into ruin after occupation ceased in about 1825. The village's most famous resident was the playwright John Ford, who was born at Bagtor House. Today Today, the village has a pub (The Carpenters Arms) a hotel (The Ilsington Hotel) and a village shop (Ilsington Village Shop), a non-profit shop where the villagers work voluntary shifts throughout the week. Nearby Haytor Vale has the Rock Inn, and Liverton has The Star and The Welcome Stranger. There are two schools in the parish: Blackpool School and Ilsington Primary School. The Book of Ilsington: A Photographic History of the Parish was written by Dick Wills who lived in the parish all his life, and was the 14th generation of the Wills family to live and farm at Narracombe.

In the background can be seen the aerials of the Croydon transmitting station to the left and the Crystal Palace transmitting station to the right. South Norwood Country Park is a park in South Norwood, close to Elmers End and Birkbeck train stations. The historic Kent-Surrey border runs through the site, and since 1965 it has been located wholly in the London Borough of Croydon. It is a 47 hectare (116 acre) green space which opened in 1989. The park is a mix of countryside and parkland, and land formerly used for sewage farms serving the growing London population. Croydon Sports Arena, the home of Croydon F.C., is on the south-eastern edge of the park. There is also a car park and visitor centre, and a duck pond similar to the one at South Norwood Lake.  History  The site that is now known as South Norwood Country Park has undergone many changes in its long and chequered history, from the days of the Great North Wood to ancient moated house, sewage farm, farming, the war years, civil defence, allotments, wasteland, highways, refuse dump and now the Country Park. = La Motes medieval moated site = The site of the moat, now heavily overgrown and hard to make out The Park was the location of a medieval moated manor, the site of which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. An archaeological excavation was carried out in 1972 by Lillian Thornhill on behalf of the Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society in an attempt to ascertain the age of the double- sided moat shown on the Thomas Morley estate map of 1736 with the name La Motes. On an earlier estate map of Peter Burrell, the land is indicated as adjoining Sturts Land and is given the name Lame Oates which is obviously a phonetic corruption of La Motes. Deeds of 1467 relate to a mortgage transaction at Leweland between Richard at Cherte and Stephan and John Fabian of London. At an earlier date, there is documentary evidence of a 13th- or 14th-century manor house of some importance on the site. The principal owner was Robert de Retford, one of the King's itinerant judges, active between 1295 and 1318. The low-lying position of the land, with streams flowing through it, raises the possibility of natural phenomena, such as the floods of 1315 to 1317, having played a part in the house's disappearance. Most of the moated earthworks were filled in during the period when the site was used as a sewage farm. The site is formed of two concentric moats, in the middle of which is a square platform where the manor house once stood. The site is now heavily overgrown, though it can be made out on old aerial photographs. = Sewage farm = From about 1862 the land was acquired by Croydon Corporation for use as a sewage farm. This was largely unsuccessful because of the heavy London Clay subsoil that makes up the majority of the site. A series of concrete channels (some of which are still visible today) were constructed to direct the sewage over the numerous lagoons but these were a failure as the lagoons would remain flooded for months without draining away. A tram going through the park In the 1920s a new method for the treatment of sewage had to be found so the farm was largely abandoned and a new sewage treatment works was built on the area now used for the pitch and putt course. This was shut down in 1962 and the area was left mostly undisturbed until the creation of the Country Park in 1988‚Äì99. It is still often referred to as 'the Sewage Farm' by the older local residents, however, despite not having been used as such for several decades. The manager of the farm was Albert David Prior. = War years = The years leading up to World War II brought about even more dramatic changes, with the armed forces using the area for training. During the war, the site became an A.R.P. (Air Raid Precaution) centre and the civil defence unit was also based here until the 1950s; there was even a ruined house that was specially constructed for the rescue services to practise in. During the blitz, when hundreds of buildings were destroyed in Croydon (a heavily targeted town) and surrounding areas, much of the spoils were dumped on the land. This rubble eventually mounted up to form what is now the large hill behind the sports arena today. It is the principal viewpoint in the park and from the top of it you can see the London Docklands, Shirley Hills, Crystal Palace, Croydon, and as far east as Bromley. It is the southern terminus of a cycling route from Greenwich, called the Waterlink Way.  Playground  The playground at South Norwood Country Park has been rebuilt since it was shut down in 2006 due to health and safety issues. During 2008 Croydon Council constructed a lottery-funded playground in a large space which was formerly part of the pitch and putt course. The equipment is intended for children aged 4 to 14.  Wildlife  With a wide range of different habitats, the country park is a haven for wildlife and an important site for nature conservation. It is a Local Nature Reserve. Many wetlands and ponds in Britain have become polluted or have disappeared, leaving the plants and animals that like wet conditions with fewer places to live. The Dragonfly Pond was built to encourage dragonflies and damselflies, and many other plants and animals such as frogs, toads and newts can be found there too. In the summer months the blue and green Emperor Dragonfly, the largest dragonfly in Britain, can be found there. South Norwood Country Park has an excellent bird record with over 100 different species being sighted each year. The large wetlands in particular attract a wide variety of birds.

It may, albeit rarely, develop into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis. It is one of four myeloproliferative neoplasms (blood cancers) that occur when the body makes too many white or red blood cells, or platelets). Signs and symptoms Most people with essential thrombocythemia are without symptoms at the time of diagnosis, which is usually made after noting an elevated platelet level on a routine complete blood count (CBC). The most common symptoms are bleeding (due to dysfunctional platelets), blood clots (e.g., deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, visual disturbances, dizziness, fainting, and numbness in the extremities; the most common signs are increased white blood cell count, reduced red blood cell count, and an enlarged spleen. Cause In ET, megakaryocytes are more sensitive to growth factors. Platelets derived from the abnormal megakaryocytes are activated, which, along with the elevated platelet count, contributes to the likelihood of forming blood clots. The increased possibility of bleeding when the platelet count is over 1 million is due to von Willebrand factor (vWF) sequestration by the increased mass of platelets, leaving insufficient vWF for platelet adhesion. A mutation in the JAK2 kinase (V617F) is present in 40‚Äì50% of cases and is diagnostic if present. JAK2 is a member of the Janus kinase family. In 2013, two groups detected calreticulin mutations in a majority of JAK2-negative/MPL-negative patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, which makes CALR mutations the second most common in myeloproliferative neoplasms. All mutations (insertions or deletions) affected the last exon, generating a reading frame shift of the resulting protein, that creates a novel terminal peptide and causes a loss of endoplasmic reticulum KDEL retention signal. Diagnosis The following revised diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythaemia were proposed in 2005. The diagnosis requires the presence of both A criteria together with B3 to B6, or of criterion A1 together with B1 to B6. The criteria are as follows: * A1. Platelet count > 400 √ó 103/¬µL for at least 2 months. * A2. Acquired V617F JAK2 mutation present * B1. No cause for a reactive thrombocytosis ** normal inflammatory indices * B2. No evidence of iron deficiency ** stainable iron in the bone marrow or normal red cell mean corpuscular volume * B3. No evidence of polycythemia vera ** hematocrit < midpoint of normal range or normal red cell mass in presence of normal iron stores * B4. No evidence of chronic myeloid leukemia ** But the Philadelphia chromosome may be present in up to 10% of cases. Patients with the Philadelphia chromosome have a potential for the development of acute leukemia, especially acute lymphocytic leukemia. * B5. No evidence of myelofibrosis ** no collagen fibrosis and ‚â§ grade 2 reticulin fibrosis (using 0‚Äì4 scale) * B6. No evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome ** no significant dysplasia ** no cytogenetic abnormalities suggestive of myelodysplasia Treatment =Indications= Not all those affected will require treatment at presentation. People are usually split up into low and high risk for bleeding/blood clotting groups (based on their age, their medical history, their blood counts and their lifestyles), low risk individuals are usually treated with aspirin, whereas those at high risk are given hydroxycarbamide and/or other treatments that reduce platelet count (such as interferon-Œ± and anagrelide). =Agents= Hydroxycarbamide, interferon-Œ± and anagrelide can lower the platelet count. Low-dose aspirin is used to reduce the risk of blood clot formation unless the platelet count is very high, where there is a risk of bleeding from the disease, and hence this measure would be counter-productive as aspirin-use increases the risk of bleeding. The PT1 study compared hydroxyurea plus aspirin to anagrelide plus aspirin as initial therapy for ET. Hydroxyurea treated patients had a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis, lower incidence of severe bleeding and lower incidence of transformation to myelofibrosis, but the risk of venous thrombosis was higher with hydroxycarbamide than with anagrelide. It is unknown whether the results are applicable to all ET patients. In people with symptomatic ET and extremely high platelet counts (exceeding 1 million), plateletpheresis can be used to remove platelets from the blood to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Prognosis Essential thrombocythemia is sometimes described as a slowly progressive disorder with long asymptomatic periods punctuated by thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. However, well-documented medical regimens can reduce and control the number of platelets, which reduces the risk of these thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. The lifespan of a well controlled ET person is well within the expected range for a person of similar age but without ET. ET is the myeloproliferative neoplasm least likely to progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Epidemiology The incidence of ET is 0.6-2.5/100,000 per year, the median age at onset is 65‚Äì70 years and it is more frequent in females than in males. The incidence in children is 0.09/100,000 per year. Pregnancy Hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide are contraindicated during pregnancy and nursing. Essential thrombocythemia can be linked with a three-fold increase in risk of miscarriage. Throughout pregnancy, close monitoring of the mother and fetus is recommended. Low-dose low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin) may be used. For life- threatening complications, the platelet count can be reduced rapidly using plateletpheresis, a procedure that removes platelets from the blood and returns the remainder to the patient.

We were addressing the same question, but in two languages.\\"Jalal Al-e Ahmad, Occidentosis: A Plague From the West, Mizan Press (1984), p. 25 Throughout the twelve chapters of the essay, Al-e Ahmad defines gharbzadegi as a contagious disease, lists its initial symptoms and details its etiology, diagnoses local patients, offers prognosis for patients in other localities, and consults with other specialists to suggest a rather hazy antidote.Hendelman-Baavur, Liora, \\"The Odyssey of Jalal Al-Ahmad's Gharbzadegi - Five Decades After,\\" in Kamran Talattof ed., Persian Language, Literature and Culture: New Leaves, Fresh Looks (London and NY: Routledge, 2015), pp. 258-286. His message was embraced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, who wrote in 1971 that > \\"The poisonous culture of imperialism [is] penetrating to the depths of > towns and villages throughout the Muslim world, displacing the culture of > the Qur'an, recruiting our youth en masse to the service of foreigners and > imperialists...\\"\\"Message to the Pilgrims\\" (Message sent to Iranian pilgrims > on Hajj in Saudi Arabia from Khomeini in exile in Najaf) February 6, 1971, > Islam and Revolution: Writings and Declarations of Imam Khomeini, (1981), > p.195 and became part of the ideology of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which emphasized nationalization of industry, independence in all areas of life from both the Soviet and the Western world, and \\"self-sufficiency\\" in economics. He was also one of the main influences of Ahmadinejad.Avideh Mayville, \\"The Religious Ideology of Reform in Iran\\" in J. Harold Ellens (ed.), Winning Revolutions: The Psychosocial Dynamics of Revolts for Freedom, Fairness, and Rights [3 volumes], ABC-CLIO (2013), p. 311 Discourse of authenticity Ali Mirsepasi believes that Jalal is concerned with the discourse of authenticity along with Shariati. According to Mirsepasi, Jalal extended his critiques of the hegemonic power of west. The critique is centered on the concept of westoxication. Al Ahamad attacks to secular intellectual with the concept. He believes that the intellectuals could not construct effectively an authentically Iranian modernity. In this occasion, he posed the concept of ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to an Islamic culture which is authentic at the same time. Jalal believed for avoiding the homogenizing and alienating forces of modernity it is necessary to return to roots of Islamic culture. Of course the discourse by Jalal was a few complicated politically. In fact, Al Ahmad wanted to reimagine modernity with Iranian-Islamic tradition. =Political activism= Al-e-Ahmad joined the communist Tudeh Party along with his mentor Khalil Maleki shortly after World War II. They \\"were too independent for the party\\" and resigned in protest over the lack of democracy and the \\"nakedly pro-Soviet\\" support for Soviet demands for oil concession and occupation of Iranian Azerbaijan. They formed an alternative party the Socialist Society of the Iranian Masses in January 1948 but disbanded it a few days later when Radio Moscow attacked it, unwilling to publicly oppose \\"what they considered the world's most progressive nations.\\" Nonetheless, the dissent of Al-e-Ahmad and Maleki marked \\"the end of the near hegemony of the party over intellectual life.\\"Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.290 He later helped found the pro-Mossadegh Toilers Party, one of the component parties of the National Front, and then in 1952 a new party called the Third Force. Following the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat Al-e- Ahmad was imprisoned for several years and \\"so completely lost faith in party politics\\" that he signed a letter of repentance published in an Iranian newspaper declaring that he had \\"resigned from the Third Force, and ... completely abandoned politics.\\"Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.291 However, he remained a part of the Third Force political group, attending its meetings, and continuing to follow the political mentorship of Khalil Maleki until their deaths in 1969.In 1963, visited Israel for two weeks, and in his account of his trip stated that the fusion of the religious and the secular he discerned in Israel afforded a potential model for the state of Iran.Adam Shatz, 'Israel‚Äôs Putinisation,' The London Review of Books Vol. 38 No. 4 ¬∑ 18 February 2016 pages 11-12. Despite his relationship with the secular Third Force group, Al-e-Ahmad became more sympathetic to the need for religious leadership in the transformation of Iranian politics, especially after the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1963. Literary life Al-e-Ahmad used a colloquial style in prose. In this sense, he is a follower of avant-garde Persian novelists like Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh. Since the subjects of his works (novels, essays, travelogues and ethnographic monographs) are usually cultural, social and political issues, symbolic representations and sarcastic expressions are regular patterns of his books. A distinct characteristic of his writings is his honest examination of subjects, regardless of possible reactions from political, social or religious powers. On invitation of Richard Nelson Frye, Al-e-Ahmad spent a summer at Harvard University, as part of a Distinguished Visiting Fellowship program established by Henry Kissinger for supporting promising Iranian intellectuals. Al-e-Ahmad rigorously supported Nima Yushij (father of modern Persian poetry) and had an important role in acceptance of Nima's revolutionary style. In \\"a short but prolific career\\", his writings \\"came to fill over thirty-five volumes.\\"Dr Stephanie Cronin, Reformers and Revolutionaries in Modern Iran: New Perspectives on the Iranian Left, Routledge (2013), p. 269 =Novels and novellas= *The School Principal *By the Pen *The Tale of Beehives *The Cursing of the Land *A Stone upon a Grave Many of his novels, including the first two in the list above, have been translated into English. =Short stories= * \\"The setar\\" * \\"Of our suffering\\" * \\"Someone else's child\\" * \\"Pink nail-polish\\" * \\"The Chinese flower pot\\" * \\"The postman\\" * \\"The treasure\\" * \\"The Pilgrimage\\" * \\"Sin\\" =Critical essays= *\\"Seven essays\\" *\\"Hurried investigations\\" *\\"Plagued by the West\\" (Gharbzadegi) =Monographs= Jalal traveled to far-off, usually poor, regions of Iran and tried to document their life, culture and problems.

The War of the Holy League may be further divided into the Ferrarese War (1510), the War of the Holy League proper (1511‚Äì1514), an Anglo-Scottish War (1513) and an Anglo-French War (1513‚Äì1514). Certain historians (notably Phillips and Axelrod) refer to each of the component wars separately, while others (notably Norwich) treat the entire conflict as a single war. was a major conflict in the Italian Wars of 1494‚Äì1559. The main participants of the war, fought from 1508 to 1516, were France, the Papal States, and the Republic of Venice, joined at various times by nearly every significant power in Western Europe, including Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Florence, the Duchy of Ferrara, and Swiss mercenaries. Pope Julius II, intending to curb Venetian influence in northern Italy, brought together the League of Cambrai‚Äîan anti- Venetian alliance consisting of him, Louis XII of France, Ferdinand II of Aragon, and Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor‚Äîin December 1508. Although the League was initially successful, friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France. The Veneto‚ÄìPapal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about the division of the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis on the throne of France, the French and Venetians would, through victory at Marignano in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508. Prelude In the aftermath of the First Italian War (1494‚Äì1498), Pope Alexander VI had, with French assistance, moved to consolidate Papal control over central Italy by seizing the Romagna.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 56‚Äì57. Cesare Borgia, acting as Gonfalonier of the Papal armies, had expelled the Bentivoglio family from Bologna, which they had ruled as a fief, and was well on his way towards establishing a permanent Borgia state in the region when Alexander died on 18 August 1503.Norwich, History of Venice, 390. Although Cesare managed to seize the remnants of the Papal treasury for his own use, he was unable to secure Rome itself, as French and Spanish armies converged on the city in an attempt to influence the Papal conclave; the election of Pius III (who soon died, to be replaced by Julius II) stripped Cesare of his titles and relegated him to commanding a company of men-at-arms.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 168‚Äì175. Sensing Cesare's weakness, the dispossessed lords of the Romagna offered to submit to the Republic of Venice in exchange for aid in regaining their dominions; the Venetian Senate accepted and had taken possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities by the end of 1503.Norwich, History of Venice, 391. Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare, first in Bologna and later in Ravenna, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized.Shaw, Julius II, 127‚Äì132, 135‚Äì139. The Republic of Venice, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 85. In response, Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice; the death of Isabella I of Castile and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance, but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities.Norwich, History of Venice, 392. Julius, although unsatisfied with his gains, did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic; for the next two years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia, which, located between Papal and Venetian territory, had in the meantime assumed a status of quasi-independence.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 189‚Äì190. In 1507, Julius returned to the question of the cities in Venetian hands; once again rebuffed by the Senate, he encouraged Emperor Maximilian I to attack the Republic.Norwich, History of Venice, 392. Maximilian, using his journey to Rome for the Imperial coronation as a pretext, entered Venetian territory with a large army in February 1508 and advanced on Vicenza, but was defeated by a Venetian army under Bartolomeo d'Alviano.Norwich, History of Venice, 393. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure; Alviano not only routed the Imperial army but also seized the entire County of Gorizia, Austrian Istria (Merania and the county of Pazin), as well as Trieste, Fiume, and the westernmost portions of Inner Carniola, forcing Maximilian to conclude a truce with Venice.Norwich, History of Venice, 393. League of Cambrai In the spring of 1508, the Republic provoked Julius by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza; in response, the Pope called for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice.Norwich, History of Venice, 394‚Äì395. The appointment was in keeping with prevailing custom, but Julius considered it an act of defiance against his authority. On 10 December 1508, representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, and Ferdinand I of Spain concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 87. The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice's territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Maximilian, in addition to regaining Gorizia, Trieste, Merania, and eastern Istria, would receive Verona, Vicenza, Padua, and the Friuli; France would annex Brescia, Crema, Bergamo, and Cremona to its Milanese possessions; Ferdinand would seize Otranto; and the remainder, including Rimini and Ravenna, would be added to the Papal States.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 196‚Äì197; Shaw, Julius II, 228‚Äì234 On 9 May 1509, Louis crossed the Adda River at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 89. To oppose him, Venice had hired a condottiere army under the command of the Orsini cousins‚ÄîBartolomeo d'Alviano and Niccol√≤ di Pitigliano‚Äîbut had failed to account for their disagreement on how best to stop the French advance.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 195; Norwich, History of Venice, 398. On 14 May, Alviano confronted the French at the Battle of Agnadello; outnumbered, he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin, who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way.Taylor, Art of War in Italy, 119. Alviano, disregarding the new orders, continued the engagement; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 195; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 89‚Äì90. Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis; but his mercenary troops, hearing of Alviano's defeat, had deserted in large numbers by the next morning, forcing him to retreat to Treviso with the remnants of the Venetian army.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 195‚Äì196; Norwich, History of Venice, 399‚Äì400. The Venetian collapse was complete.Norwich, History of Venice, 400. Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance; the Venetians lost all the territory that they had accumulated in northern Italy during the previous century.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 90‚Äì91; Norwich, History of Venice, 400. The major cities that had not been occupied by the French‚ÄîPadua, Verona, and Vicenza‚Äîwere left undefended by Pitigliano's withdrawal, and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 91; Norwich, History of Venice, 401. Julius, having in the meantime issued an interdict against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic, invaded the Romagna and captured Ravenna with the assistance of Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara.Norwich, History of Venice, 401‚Äì402. D'Este, having joined the League and been appointed Gonfalonier on 19 April, seized the Polesine for himself.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 95; Norwich, History of Venice, 401‚Äì402. The newly arrived Imperial governors, however, quickly proved to be unpopular.Norwich, History of Venice, 403‚Äì404. In mid-July, the citizens of Padua, aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the proveditor Andrea Gritti, revolted.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 94; Norwich, History of Venice, 404. The landsknechts garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance, and Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July.Norwich, History of Venice, 404. The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 94; Norwich, History of Venice, 404. In early August, a massive Imperial army, accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops, set out from Trento into the Veneto.Norwich, History of Venice, 404‚Äì405. Because of a lack of horses, as well as general disorganization, Maximilian's forces were slow to begin the Siege of Padua, giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city.Norwich, History of Venice, 405. Although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua's walls, the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian, growing impatient, lifted the siege on 1 October and withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 94‚Äì95; Norwich, History of Venice, 405. Pope Julius II, painted by Raphael (oil on wood, c. 1511). Julius attempted to secure Papal authority in Italy by creating the League of Cambrai, an alliance aimed at curbing Venetian power. In mid-November, Pitigliano returned to the offensive, recapturing Vicenza, Este, Feltre, and Belluno; an attack on Verona failed, but Pitigliano destroyed a Papal army under Francesco II of Gonzaga in the process.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 95; Norwich, History of Venice, 405‚Äì406. Angelo Trevisan organized a river attack on Ferrara by the Venetian galley fleet, but the resulting Battle of Polesella ended in another defeat for the Republic when the Venetian ships anchored in the Po River were sunk by Ferrarese artillery.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 95; Norwich, History of Venice, 406. Faced with a shortage of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 209; Norwich, History of Venice, 406‚Äì408. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them.Norwich, History of Venice, 408. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them in February 1510; even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.Norwich, History of Venice, 408‚Äì409. This apparent reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop multiple French, Ferrarese, and Imperial armies from invading Venetian territory in May 1510.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 96. Gianpaolo Baglioni and Andrea Gritti, left in command of the Venetian forces by Pitigliano's death in January, withdrew to Padua; by 24 May, the League's armies had taken Vicenza and the Polesine, and were advancing on Legnago.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 96; Norwich, History of Venice, 410. Gritti fortified Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco- Imperial army, but Louis, frustrated by Maximilian's failure to appear in person and distracted by the death of his advisor, the Cardinal d'Amboise, abandoned his plans for a siege.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 96; Norwich, History of Venice, 410‚Äì414. Veneto-Papal alliance Julius, meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy; more significantly, alienated from Alfonso d'Este by friction over a licence for a salt monopoly in the Papal States and Alfonso's continued forays against Venetian forces to secure his recently reacquired Polesine, he had formulated plans to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, and to add its territory to the Papal States.Rowland, \\"A summer outing in 1510\\". His own forces being inadequate for the venture, the Pope hired an army of Swiss mercenaries, ordering them to attack the French in Milan; he also invited Venice to ally with him against Louis.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 210‚Äì211; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 97‚Äì98; Norwich, History of Venice, 414‚Äì415. The Republic, facing a renewed French onslaught, readily accepted the offer.Norwich, History of Venice, 415. Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara; excommunicated by Julius, he inflicted a number of defeats on the Papal forces By July 1510, the new Veneto-Papal alliance was on the offensive.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 97‚Äì98; Norwich, History of Venice, 416. An initial attack on French-occupied Genoa failed, but Venetian troops under Lucio Malvezzo finally drove the French from Vicenza in early August, and a joint force commanded by Francesco Maria della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino, captured Modena on 17 August.Norwich, History of Venice, 415‚Äì416. Julius now excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, thus justifying an attack on the Duchy of Ferrara itself; in anticipation of his coming victory, the Pope traveled to Bologna, so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken.Norwich, History of Venice, 416. The French army, however, had been left unopposed by the Swiss (who, having arrived in Lombardy, had been bribed into leaving by Louis) and was free to march south into the heart of Italy.Norwich, History of Venice, 416. In early October, Charles II d'Amboise advanced on Bologna, splitting the Papal forces; by 18 October, he was only a few miles from the city.Norwich, History of Venice, 416. Julius now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French; left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry, he resorted to excommunicating d'Amboise, who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 214; Norwich, History of Venice, 417. Pope Julius II on the walls of the conquered city of Mirandola (oil on canvas by Raffaello Tancredi, 1890, City Hall of Mirandola) In December 1510, a newly assembled Papal army conquered Concordia and besieged the fortress of Mirandola; d'Amboise, marching to relieve the latter, fell ill and died, briefly leaving the French in disarray; the pope took personal command of the siege, and Mirandola fell in January 1511.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 216; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 100; Norwich, History of Venice, 417. Alfonso d'Este, meanwhile, confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the Po River, leaving Bologna isolated once more; Julius, afraid of being trapped by the French, departed the city for Ravenna.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 100; Norwich, History of Venice, 417. Cardinal Francesco Alidosi, whom he left behind to command the defense of the city, was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius himself had been; and when, in May 1511, a French army commanded by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio approached, the citizens of Bologna revolted, expelled Alidosi, and opened their gates to the French.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 100‚Äì101; Norwich, History of Venice, 417‚Äì418. Julius blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino, who, finding this quite unfair, proceeded to murder Alidosi in full view of the Papal guard.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 227; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 101; Norwich, History of Venice, 418. Holy League In October 1511, Julius proclaimed a Holy League against France.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 103; Norwich, History of Venice, 419‚Äì420. The new alliance included not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire (which abandoned any pretense of adhering to the League of Cambrai in hopes of seizing Navarre from Queen Catherine and Lombardy from Louis), but also Henry VIII of England who, having decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France, concluded the Treaty of Westminster‚Äîa pledge of mutual aid against the French‚Äîwith Ferdinand on 17 November.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 219; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 103; Hutchinson, Young Henry, 159. Gaston de Foix during the Battle of Ravenna heralded a long period of defeats for France. Louis now appointed his nephew, Gaston de Foix, to command the French forces in Italy.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 218; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 104. Foix proved more energetic than d'Amboise and Trivulzio had been; having checked the advance of Ram√≥n de Cardona's Spanish troops on Bologna, he returned to Lombardy to sack Brescia, which had rebelled against the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 219‚Äì220; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 104‚Äì105; Norwich, History of Venice, 420. Aware that much of the French army would be diverted to deal with the impending English invasion, Foix and Alfonso d'Este besieged Ravenna, the last Papal stronghold in the Romagna, in hopes of forcing the Holy League into a decisive engagement.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 244; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 106; Norwich, History of Venice, 421. Cardona marched to relieve the city in early April 1512, and was decisively beaten in the resulting Battle of Ravenna, fought on Easter Sunday; the death of Foix during the fighting, however, left the French under the command of Jacques de la Palice, who, unwilling to continue the campaign without direct orders from Louis, contented himself with thoroughly sacking Ravenna.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 106‚Äì108; Norwich, History of Venice, 422. By May 1512, the French position had deteriorated considerably.Norwich, History of Venice, 422‚Äì423. Julius had hired another army of Swiss mercenaries; they descended on Milan, bringing with them Maximilian Sforza, who was determined to regain control of the Duchy for his family.Norwich, History of Venice, 423. The French garrisons abandoned the Romagna (where the Duke of Urbino quickly captured Bologna and Parma) and retreated to Lombardy, attempting to intercept the invasion.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 222‚Äì223; Norwich, History of Venice, 423. By August, the Swiss had combined with the Venetian army and forced Trivulzio out of Milan, allowing Sforza to be proclaimed Duke with their support; La Palice was then forced to withdraw across the Alps.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 222‚Äì223; Norwich, History of Venice, 423‚Äì424; Oman, Art of War, 152. In late August, the members of the League met at Mantua to discuss the situation in Italy and the partition of territory acquired from the French.Norwich, History of Venice, 424. They quickly came to an agreement regarding Florence, which had angered Julius by allowing Louis to convene the Council of Pisa in its territory; at the Pope's request, Ramon de Cardona marched into Tuscany, smashed Florentine resistance, overthrew the Florentine Republic, and installed Giuliano de' Medici as ruler of the city.Hibbert, House of Medici, 211‚Äì214; Hibbert, Florence, 168; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 117‚Äì118. On the subject of territory, however, fundamental disagreements quickly arose.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 116. Julius and the Venetians insisted that Maximilian Sforza be permitted to keep the Duchy of Milan, while Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand maneuvered to have one of their relatives installed as duke.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 118‚Äì119. The Pope demanded the annexation of Ferrara to the Papal States; Ferdinand objected to this arrangement, desiring the existence of an independent Ferrara to counter growing Papal power.Norwich, History of Venice, 424. The Emperor refused to relinquish any Imperial territory, which in his eyes included most of the Veneto, and signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition; when the Republic objected, Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai against her.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 118‚Äì119; Norwich, History of Venice, 424‚Äì425. In response, Venice turned to Louis; on 23 March 1513, a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at Blois.Norwich, History of Venice, 425. Pope Julius II, meanwhile, had died in February, and Cardinal Giovanni di Lorenzo de Medici, second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and elder brother of the new ruler of Florence, was elected Pope Leo X. Franco-Venetian alliance In late May 1513, a French army commanded by Louis de la Tr√©moille crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan; at the same time, Bartolomeo d'Alviano and the Venetian army marched west from Padua.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 229; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 121; Norwich, History of Venice, 428. The unpopularity of Maximilian Sforza, who was seen by the Milanese as a puppet of his Swiss mercenaries, enabled the French to move through Lombardy with little resistance; Tr√©moille, having seized Milan, besieged the remaining Swiss in Novara.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 229; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 121; Norwich, History of Venice, 428. On 6 June, the French were attacked by a Swiss relief army at the Battle of Novara, and were routed despite having superior numbers.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 122; Oman, Art of War, 153‚Äì154; Taylor, Art of War in Italy, 123. Detachments of the Swiss army pursued the fleeing French over the Alps and had reached Dijon before being bribed into withdrawing.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 233; Goubert, Course of French History, 135; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 122‚Äì123. The rout at Novara inaugurated a period of defeats for the French alliance. English troops under Henry VIII besieged Th√©rouanne, defeated La Palice at the Battle of the Spurs, and captured Tournai.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 231‚Äì233. In Navarre, resistance to Ferdinand's invasion collapsed; he rapidly consolidated his hold over the entire region and moved to support another English offensive in the Guyenne.Kamen, Empire, 35. James IV of Scotland invaded England at the behest of Louis;Guicciardini, History of Italy, 280. but he failed to draw Henry's attention from France, and his death‚Äîand the Scots' catastrophic defeat‚Äîat the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, ended Scotland's brief involvement in the war.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 234. In 1515, the Franco-Venetian alliance decisively defeated the Holy League at the Battle of Marignano. Meanwhile, Alviano, unexpectedly left without French support, retreated into the Veneto, pursued closely by the Spanish army under Cardona; while the Spanish were unable to capture Padua in the face of determined Venetian resistance, they penetrated deep into Venetian territory and by late September were in sight of Venice itself.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 123; Norwich, History of Venice, 428‚Äì429. Cardona attempted a bombardment of the city that proved largely ineffective; then, having no boats with which to cross the Venetian Lagoon, turned back for Lombardy.Norwich, History of Venice, 429. Alviano, having been reinforced by hundreds of volunteers from the Venetian nobility, pursued Cardona and confronted him outside Vicenza on 7 October; in the resulting Battle of La Motta, the Venetian army was decisively defeated, with many prominent noblemen cut down outside the city walls as they attempted to flee.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 123‚Äì124; Norwich, History of Venice, 429. Cardona and Alviano continued to skirmish in the Friuli for the remainder of 1513 and through 1514.Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 124‚Äì125; Norwich, History of Venice, 429. The death of Louis XII on 1 January 1515 brought Francis I to the throne; having assumed the title of Duke of Milan at his coronation, Francis immediately moved to reclaim his holdings in Italy.Norwich, History of Venice, 430. By July, Francis had assembled an army in the Dauphin√©; a combined Swiss and Papal force moved north from Milan to block the Alpine passes against him, but Francis, following the advice of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, avoided the main passes and marched instead through the valley of the Stura.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 72; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 127‚Äì128; Norwich, History of Venice, 430. The French vanguard surprised the Milanese cavalry at Villafranca, capturing Prospero Colonna;Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 72; Taylor, Art of War in Italy, 67. meanwhile, Francis and the main body of the French confronted the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano on 13 September.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 73‚Äì75; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 128; Norwich, History of Venice, 431; Oman, Art of War, 164‚Äì165. The Swiss advance initially made headway; however, Francis's superiority in cavalry and artillery, together with the timely arrival of Alviano (who had successfully avoided Cardona's army at Verona) on the morning of 14 September, led to a decisive victory for Francis and the Venetians.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 75‚Äì77; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 128‚Äì130; Norwich, History of Venice, 431; Oman, Art of War, 165‚Äì171. Aftermath After the victory at Marignano, Francis advanced on Milan, capturing the city on 4 October and removing Sforza from the throne.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 77; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 130; Norwich, History of Venice, 431. In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his Swiss mercenaries, surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 290; Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 82‚Äì83; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 131; Norwich, History of Venice, 431‚Äì432. In return, Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the Duchy of Urbino.Norwich, History of Venice, 432. Finally, the Treaty of Noyon, signed by Francis and Charles V in August 1516, recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples, removing Spain from the war.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 84; Norwich, History of Venice, 432. Maximilian held out, making another attempt to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into negotiations with Francis.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 85; Mallett and Shaw, The Italian Wars, 132‚Äì133; Norwich, History of Venice, 432. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for Cremona), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508.Norwich, History of Venice, 432. The peace, however, would last only four years; the growing rivalry between the House of Valois and the House of Habsburg, and the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, would soon lead to the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26.Knecht, Renaissance Warrior, 165‚Äì175.

It is located in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, about 2.2 miles (3.5 km) north west of Rotherham town centre and 4.7 miles (7.6 km) north-east of the City of Sheffield. History Kimberworth is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, where it is noted as \\"Chiberworde\\". Kimberworth castle, now demolished, was located near The Drawbridge pub. The monks at nearby Kirkstead Abbey were smelting iron from around 1160, the rest of the history of this area is heavily influenced by industrial developments, especially in iron, steel and coal. There is evidence of human activity in this area going back 5000 years. The area was settled by Brigantes, before the arrival of the Romans. The Roman expansion north was halted by the Brigantes forts at Kimberworth and Wincobank. The present manor house at Kimberworth was built in 1694 by the Kent family, long prominent at Kimberworth, who married with, amongst others, the Rawson family of Upperthorpe and the Creswick family that had owned land at Owlerton since the fourteenth century. Places of worship The Kimberworth area has several churches, the most prominent being St Thomas's Anglican Church on Church Street, construction of which was started in 1842. The Salvation Army has a meeting hall on High Street, this is also used by the 1st Rotherham Cub Scout pack. Kimberworth United Reformed Church met in a building on Kimberworth Road overlooking Bradgate Park (Church closed in 2010).

She was purchased by the British Admiralty in 1940, as these fruit ships were considered to be fast and manoeuvrable. In 1941 the Admiralty converted her and seven others to Anti-aircraft Artillery ships and eventually Fighter Direction Ships (seagoing Anti Aircraft Auxiliaries). Most likely the conversion took place at Fairfields yard in Govan on the Clyde with her sister ship HMS Pozarica. Noted operations In March 1942, she sailed with Pozarica, and the corvettes , , and for the port of Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur. In June 1942, she sailed as an escort in the infamous Convoy PQ 17, where 25 out 36 ships were lost to the enemy, while working around Murmansk and Archangel. In November 1942, HMS Palomares took part in the Operation Torch landings in Algiers as an Anti Aircraft ship. The ship left Gibraltar on the 3rd and arriving on the 8th. However the next day Palomares was hit by a bomb suffering a large number of casualties, engulfed in flames her steering gear was put out of action. Deceased seamen were transferred to the corvette for burial at sea and her steering gear was repaired by the 10th. In September 1943, during the Salerno landings of Italy on the 9th, Palomares was a Fighter Direction ship, directing fighter planes with her radar system. In January 1944, Palomares again served as a Fighter Direction ship during the Anzio landings. Arriving at the beachhead on the 22nd, she struck a mine and was towed back to Naples by the tugs Edenshaw and Evea. In September 1945, Palomares was to have participated in the Malaya landings but couldn't as fire damaged her engine room. Armaments and displacement Upon being converted as an Anti Aircraft ship HMS Palomares was equipped with: 8 4\\" AA guns and 8 2 pounder AA guns. In December 1942, to take the role as a fighter-direction ship, Palomares was fitted with radar for directing fighter aircraft. HMS Palomares had a weight of 1,896 tons and could move at 13.5 Knots. Returned Surviving the war, HMS Palomares was returned to the MacAndrews Line in 1946, where she continued service until the mid-1950s.

Current versions are typically standoff weapons known as land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs), which are used to attack predetermined land targets with conventional or nuclear payloads. Anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) are also used, and some submarine-launched cruise missiles have variants for both functions. History of development The U.S. Navy's first land-attack cruise missile submarines (4 SSG and 1 SSGN) deployed with the Regulus missile from 1958 until retired in 1964 with the arrival of the Polaris ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in the Pacific.Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 609-611 The US deployed the short-range Harpoon anti-ship missile on submarines beginning in 1981. The Soviet Navy converted 13 Whiskey-class submarines (Project 613) for the land-attack cruise missile (LACM) role in the late 1950s (Whiskey Single Cylinder, Whiskey Twin Cylinder, Whiskey Long Bin), armed with the SS-N-3 Shaddock (–ü-5) missile. As Soviet SSBNs armed with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) became available in the late 1960s, the Shaddock LACM was withdrawn and an anti-ship (ASCM) version replaced it. The Echo- and Juliett-class submarines of the 1960s had a similar armament history, with the Echo I's converted to attack submarines because they could not accommodate an anti-ship guidance radar. The SS-N-3 ASCM was eventually replaced with the SS-N-12 (P-500). Later, the Charlie- and Oscar-classes were designed to use long-range ASCMs, the SS-N-9 (P-120) and SS-N-19 (P-700) respectively. Only the Oscar-class remains in service. In 1990, it was reported that the Soviet Navy had deployed between 50 and 300 SLCMs. The current Akula- and Severodvinsk-class submarines are armed with the SS-N-21 (S-10) LACM.Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 396-403, 405-408 Four U.S. Navy Ohio-class SSBNs were converted in the mid-2000s to be able to salvo launch up to 144 Tomahawk cruise missiles from their modified vertical launch SLBM tubes, as opposed to launching cruise missiles from torpedo tubes as is done from attack submarines. The advantage that the submarines have over guided missile destroyers and cruisers is the ability to remain undetected and launch while submerged. Tomahawk was deployed on US Navy attack submarines beginning in 1983, originally in LACM and ASCM versions, but the ASCM version was withdrawn in the 1990s. The USSR‚Ä≤s S-10 Granat subsonic cruise missiles designed by the NPO Novator may still be in service in Russia, albeit not deployed.–†–ê–ö–ï–¢–ù–´–ô –ö–û–ú–ü–õ–ï–ö–° –°-10 ¬´–ì–†–ê–ù–ê–¢¬ª. –°–û–í–ï–¢–°–ö–ò–ô ¬´–¢–û–ú–ê–ì–ê–í–ö¬ª May 2015. In October 2015, Russia launched long-range Kalibr (Klub) cruise missiles from its small ships in the Caspian Sea on targets in Syria; in December, several 3M14K cruise missiles from Kalibr-PL system were fired from the improved Kilo-class submarine B-237 Rostov-on-Don in the Mediterranean. The deployment of Kalibr missiles, long- range, low-flying, capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads, available in land-attack, anti-ship and anti-submarine variants, was said to have altered the military balance in Europe and potentially compromised the NATO missile defence system under construction in Europe.Russia's Cruise Missiles Have Changed Strategic Military BalanceKalibr: Russia‚Äôs Naval System Upping Cruise Missile Game Jane's Defence Weekly reports that the Dolphin- class submarines are believed to be nuclear armed, offering Israel a sea- based, second strike capability.

History Dornier 328 at Mannheim City Airport Cirrus Airlines HQ, Saarbr√ºcken Cirrus Airlines was founded in February 1995 as Cirrus Luftfahrtgesellschaft mbH and operated an executive charter business. In March 1998, Cirrus Airlines received its licence to operate scheduled passenger services between Saarbr√ºcken Airport and Hamburg. In August 1999, Cirrus Airlines took over Cosmos Air, its Dornier 328 and the route between Mannheim and Berlin Tempelhof. In February 2000, upon the 5th anniversary of Cirrus Airlines, it established a cooperative partnership with German-owned Lufthansa and became a Team Lufthansa franchise member. In April that year, Cirrus received licences to operate regularly scheduled service between Mannheim City Airport and Hamburg Airport and between Berlin and Sylt. Cirrus steadily expanded its business, with scheduled services operating mainly from Saarbr√ºcken Airport and Mannheim City Airport to domestic destinations. The following years the airline started do decentralize its operations, also flying low-density point-to-point routes and adding Embraer- Jets to its Turboprop-Fleet. In 2004 Cirrus Airlines took over Augsburg Airways, a Lufthansa Regional member. The headquarters were consequently moved to Hallbergmoos, near Munich Airport. Cirrus Technik and Cirrus Flight Training remained at Saarbr√ºcken Airport. The company introduced a modified corporate identity in January 2008. Cirrus Airlines was a company within Aviation Investment Corp. along with Cirrus Maintenance and Cirrus Service. On 20 January 2012, the airline ceased operations and flew all aircraft back to Saarbr√ºcken.http://aviationupdate.blogspot.com/2012/01/reagional-carrier- cirrus-airlines.html This left some airports temporarily without scheduled service, like Hof Airport and Mannheim City Airport.

The formalism was introduced by Bryan Ford in 2004 and is closely related to the family of top-down parsing languages introduced in the early 1970s. Syntactically, PEGs also look similar to context-free grammars (CFGs), but they have a different interpretation: the choice operator selects the first match in PEG, while it is ambiguous in CFG. This is closer to how string recognition tends to be done in practice, e.g. by a recursive descent parser. Unlike CFGs, PEGs cannot be ambiguous; if a string parses, it has exactly one valid parse tree. It is conjectured that there exist context-free languages that cannot be recognized by a PEG, but this is not yet proven. PEGs are well-suited to parsing computer languages (and artificial human languages such as Lojban), but not natural languages where the performance of PEG algorithms is comparable to general CFG algorithms such as the Earley algorithm.  Definition  = Syntax = Formally, a parsing expression grammar consists of: * A finite set N of nonterminal symbols. * A finite set Œ£ of terminal symbols that is disjoint from N. * A finite set P of parsing rules. * An expression eS termed the starting expression. Each parsing rule in P has the form A ‚Üê e, where A is a nonterminal symbol and e is a parsing expression. A parsing expression is a hierarchical expression similar to a regular expression, which is constructed in the following fashion: # An atomic parsing expression consists of: #* any terminal symbol, #* any nonterminal symbol, or #* the empty string Œµ. # Given any existing parsing expressions e, e1, and e2, a new parsing expression can be constructed using the following operators: #* Sequence: e1 e2 #* Ordered choice: e1 / e2 #* Zero-or-more: e* #* One-or-more: e+ #* Optional: e? #* And-predicate: &e; #* Not-predicate: !e = Semantics = The fundamental difference between context-free grammars and parsing expression grammars is that the PEG's choice operator is ordered. If the first alternative succeeds, the second alternative is ignored. Thus ordered choice is not commutative, unlike unordered choice as in context-free grammars. Ordered choice is analogous to soft cut operators available in some logic programming languages. The consequence is that if a CFG is transliterated directly to a PEG, any ambiguity in the former is resolved by deterministically picking one parse tree from the possible parses. By carefully choosing the order in which the grammar alternatives are specified, a programmer has a great deal of control over which parse tree is selected. Like boolean context-free grammars, parsing expression grammars also add the and- and not- syntactic predicates. Because they can use an arbitrarily complex sub-expression to \\"look ahead\\" into the input string without actually consuming it, they provide a powerful syntactic lookahead and disambiguation facility, in particular when reordering the alternatives cannot specify the exact parse tree desired. = Operational interpretation of parsing expressions = Each nonterminal in a parsing expression grammar essentially represents a parsing function in a recursive descent parser, and the corresponding parsing expression represents the \\"code\\" comprising the function. Each parsing function conceptually takes an input string as its argument, and yields one of the following results: * success, in which the function may optionally move forward or consume one or more characters of the input string supplied to it, or * failure, in which case no input is consumed. An atomic parsing expression consisting of a single terminal (i.e. literal) succeeds if the first character of the input string matches that terminal, and in that case consumes the input character; otherwise the expression yields a failure result. An atomic parsing expression consisting of the empty string always trivially succeeds without consuming any input. An atomic parsing expression consisting of a nonterminal A represents a recursive call to the nonterminal-function A. A nonterminal may succeed without actually consuming any input, and this is considered an outcome distinct from failure. The sequence operator e1 e2 first invokes e1, and if e1 succeeds, subsequently invokes e2 on the remainder of the input string left unconsumed by e1, and returns the result. If either e1 or e2 fails, then the sequence expression e1 e2 fails (consuming no input). The choice operator e1 / e2 first invokes e1, and if e1 succeeds, returns its result immediately. Otherwise, if e1 fails, then the choice operator backtracks to the original input position at which it invoked e1, but then calls e2 instead, returning e2's result. The zero-or- more, one-or-more, and optional operators consume zero or more, one or more, or zero or one consecutive repetitions of their sub-expression e, respectively. Unlike in context-free grammars and regular expressions, however, these operators always behave greedily, consuming as much input as possible and never backtracking. (Regular expression matchers may start by matching greedily, but will then backtrack and try shorter matches if they fail to match.) For example, the expression a* will always consume as many a's as are consecutively available in the input string, and the expression (a* a) will always fail because the first part (a*) will never leave any a's for the second part to match. The and-predicate expression &e; invokes the sub- expression e, and then succeeds if e succeeds and fails if e fails, but in either case never consumes any input. The not-predicate expression !e succeeds if e fails and fails if e succeeds, again consuming no input in either case. = Examples = This is a PEG that recognizes mathematical formulas that apply the basic five operations to non-negative integers. Expr ‚Üê Sum Sum ‚Üê Product (('+' / '-') Product)* Product ‚Üê Power (('*' / '/') Power)* Power ‚Üê Value ('^' Power)? Value ‚Üê [0-9]+ / '(' Expr ')' In the above example, the terminal symbols are characters of text, represented by characters in single quotes, such as \`'('\` and \`')'\`. The range \`[0-9]\` is also a shortcut for ten characters, indicating any one of the digits 0 through 9. (This range syntax is the same as the syntax used by regular expressions.) The nonterminal symbols are the ones that expand to other rules: Value, Power, Product, Sum, and Expr. Note that rules Sum and Product don't lead to desired left- associativity of these operations (they don't deal with associativity at all, and it has to be handled in post-processing step after parsing), and the Power rule (by referring to itself on the right) results in desired right- associativity of exponent. Also note that a rule like \`Sum ‚Üê Sum (('+' / '-') Product)?\` (with intention to achieve left-associativity) would cause infinite recursion, so it cannot be used in practice even though it can be expressed in the grammar. The following recursive rule matches standard C-style if/then/else statements in such a way that the optional \\"else\\" clause always binds to the innermost \\"if\\", because of the implicit prioritization of the '/' operator. (In a context-free grammar, this construct yields the classic dangling else ambiguity.) S ‚Üê 'if' C 'then' S 'else' S / 'if' C 'then' S The following recursive rule matches Pascal-style nested comment syntax, . The comment symbols appear in single quotes to distinguish them from PEG operators. Begin ‚Üê '(*' End ‚Üê '*)' C ‚Üê Begin N* End N ‚Üê C / (!Begin !End Z) Z ‚Üê any single character The parsing expression matches and consumes the text \\"foo\\" but only if it is followed by the text \\"bar\\". The parsing expression matches the text \\"foo\\" but only if it is not followed by the text \\"bar\\". The expression matches a single \\"a\\" but only if it is not part of an arbitrarily long sequence of a's followed by a b. The parsing expression matches and consumes an arbitrary-length sequence of a's and b's. The production rule describes the simple context-free \\"matching language\\" \\\\\\\\{ a^n b^n : n \\\\ge 1 \\\\\\\\} . The following parsing expression grammar describes the classic non- context-free language \\\\\\\\{ a^n b^n c^n : n \\\\ge 1 \\\\\\\\} : S ‚Üê &(A 'c') 'a'+ B !. A ‚Üê 'a' A? 'b' B ‚Üê 'b' B? 'c'  Implementing parsers from parsing expression grammars  Any parsing expression grammar can be converted directly into a recursive descent parser. Due to the unlimited lookahead capability that the grammar formalism provides, however, the resulting parser could exhibit exponential time performance in the worst case. It is possible to obtain better performance for any parsing expression grammar by converting its recursive descent parser into a packrat parser, which always runs in linear time, at the cost of substantially greater storage space requirements. A packrat parser is a form of parser similar to a recursive descent parser in construction, except that during the parsing process it memoizes the intermediate results of all invocations of the mutually recursive parsing functions, ensuring that each parsing function is only invoked at most once at a given input position. Because of this memoization, a packrat parser has the ability to parse many context-free grammars and any parsing expression grammar (including some that do not represent context-free languages) in linear time. Examples of memoized recursive descent parsers are known from at least as early as 1993. This analysis of the performance of a packrat parser assumes that enough memory is available to hold all of the memoized results; in practice, if there is not enough memory, some parsing functions might have to be invoked more than once at the same input position, and consequently the parser could take more than linear time. It is also possible to build LL parsers and LR parsers from parsing expression grammars, with better worst- case performance than a recursive descent parser, but the unlimited lookahead capability of the grammar formalism is then lost. Therefore, not all languages that can be expressed using parsing expression grammars can be parsed by LL or LR parsers.  Advantages  Compared to pure regular expressions (i.e. without back-references), PEGs are strictly more powerful, but require significantly more memory. For example, a regular expression inherently cannot find an arbitrary number of matched pairs of parentheses, because it is not recursive, but a PEG can. However, a PEG will require an amount of memory proportional to the length of the input, while a regular expression matcher will require only a constant amount of memory. Any PEG can be parsed in linear time by using a packrat parser, as described above. Many CFGs contain ambiguities, even when they're intended to describe unambiguous languages. The \\"dangling else\\" problem in C, C++, and Java is one example. These problems are often resolved by applying a rule outside of the grammar. In a PEG, these ambiguities never arise, because of prioritization.  Disadvantages  = Memory consumption = PEG parsing is typically carried out via packrat parsing, which uses memoization to eliminate redundant parsing steps. Packrat parsing requires storage proportional to the total input size, rather than the depth of the parse tree as with LR parsers. This is a significant difference in many domains: for example, hand-written source code has an effectively constant expression nesting depth independent of the length of the program‚Äîexpressions nested beyond a certain depth tend to get refactored. For some grammars and some inputs, the depth of the parse tree can be proportional to the input size,for example, the LISP expression (x (x (x (x ....)))) so both an LR parser and a packrat parser will appear to have the same worst-case asymptotic performance. A more accurate analysis would take the depth of the parse tree into account separately from the input size. This is similar to a situation which arises in graph algorithms: the Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm and Floyd‚ÄìWarshall algorithm appear to have the same running time (O(V^3)) if only the number of vertices is considered. However, a more precise analysis which accounts for the number of edges as a separate parameter assigns the Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm a time of O(V*E), which is quadratic for sparse graphs with E \\\\in O(V). = Indirect left recursion = A PEG is called well-formed if it contains no left-recursive rules, i.e., rules that allow a nonterminal to expand to an expression in which the same nonterminal occurs as the leftmost symbol. For a left-to-right top-down parser, such rules cause infinite regress: parsing will continually expand the same nonterminal without moving forward in the string. Therefore, to allow packrat parsing, left recursion must be eliminated. For example, in the arithmetic grammar above, it would be tempting to move some rules around so that the precedence order of products and sums could be expressed in one line: Value ‚Üê [0-9.]+ / '(' Expr ')' Product ‚Üê Expr (('*' / '/') Expr)* Sum ‚Üê Expr (('+' / '-') Expr)* Expr ‚Üê Product / Sum / Value In this new grammar, matching an \`Expr\` requires testing if a \`Product\` matches while matching a \`Product\` requires testing if an \`Expr\` matches. Because the term appears in the leftmost position, these rules make up a circular definition that cannot be resolved. (Circular definitions that can be resolved exist‚Äîsuch as in the original formulation from the first example‚Äîbut such definitions are required not to exhibit pathological recursion.) However, left-recursive rules can always be rewritten to eliminate left-recursion. For example, the following left-recursive CFG rule: string-of-a ‚Üê string-of-a 'a'  'a' can be rewritten in a PEG using the plus operator: string-of-a ‚Üê 'a'+ The process of rewriting indirectly left-recursive rules is complex in some packrat parsers, especially when semantic actions are involved. With some modification, traditional packrat parsing can support direct left recursion, but doing so results in a loss of the linear-time parsing property which is generally the justification for using PEGs and packrat parsing in the first place. Only the OMeta parsing algorithm supports full direct and indirect left recursion without additional attendant complexity (but again, at a loss of the linear time complexity), whereas all GLR parsers support left recursion. = Expressive power = PEG packrat parsers cannot recognize some unambiguous nondeterministic CFG rules, such as the following: S ‚Üê 'x' S 'x'  'x' Neither LL(k) nor LR(k) parsing algorithms are capable of recognizing this example. However, this grammar can be used by a general CFG parser like the CYK algorithm. However, the language in question can be recognised by all these types of parser, since it is in fact a regular language (that of strings of an odd number of x's). It is an open problem to give a concrete example of a context-free language which cannot be recognized by a parsing expression grammar. = Ambiguity detection and influence of rule order on language that is matched = LL(k) and LR(k) parser generators will fail to complete when the input grammar is ambiguous. This is a feature in the common case that the grammar is intended to be unambiguous but is defective. A PEG parser generator will resolve unintended ambiguities earliest-match-first, which may be arbitrary and lead to surprising parses. The ordering of productions in a PEG grammar affects not only the resolution of ambiguity, but also the language matched. For example, consider the first PEG example in Ford's paper (example rewritten in pegjs.org/online notation, and labelled G1 and G2): * G1: * G2: Ford notes that the latter PEG rule will never succeed because the first choice is always taken if the input string ... begins with 'a'.. Specifically, (i.e., the language matched by G1) includes the input \\"ab\\", but does not. Thus, adding a new option to a PEG grammar can remove strings from the language matched, e.g. G2 is the addition of a rule to the single-production grammar , which contains a string not matched by G2. Furthermore, constructing a grammar to match from PEG grammars G1 and G2 is not always a trivial task. This is in stark contrast to CFG's, in which the addition of a new production cannot remove strings (though, it can introduce problems in the form of ambiguity), and a (potentially ambiguous) grammar for can be constructed S ‚Üí start(G1)  start(G2)  Bottom-up PEG parsing  A pika parser uses dynamic programming to apply PEG rules bottom-up and right to left, which is the inverse of the normal recursive descent order of top-down, left to right. Parsing in reverse order solves the left recursion problem, allowing left-recursive rules to be used directly in the grammar without being rewritten into non-left-recursive form, and also conveys optimal error recovery capabilities upon the parser, which historically proved difficult to achieve for recursive descent parsers.

In this game, players drive a Ferrari 328 or a generic Formula One racing machine through a race course. The game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe months after its debut on Family Computer. The title became well known for being one of two titles from Square that made use of stereoscopic 3D, which was made possible by wearing a pair of anaglyph glasses. The game was originally conceived by Square president Masafumi Miyamoto as an opportunity for developer Nasir Gebelli to demonstrate his 3D programming skills. The games 3D mode was primarily developed by Gebelli and often hand drawn by him. Techniques to simulate three dimensional roads were later used in Final Fantasy III. The game sold half a million copies and is considered one of the best racing games on the NES, but was also criticized as being derivative of other racing games from the period. Many comparisons to arcade game Out Run, were made, though critics cited some differences including a greater sense of speed in Rad Racer. The game appeared in the 1989 film The Wizard, and was one of three games to feature a special competition course in the 1990 Nintendo World Championship. Gameplay Players can engage a stereoscopic 3D mode by pressing the select button while wearing included anaglyph 3D glasses. Gameplay is sprite-based and the player controls the car from a behind the vehicle perspective. Players can choose between two types of car to race; either a 328 Twin Turbo or an F1 machine, and then tries to complete eight driving stages. Competitors vehicles get faster as the levels progress, and include VB Bugs to Ferrari Testarossas. Players can accelerate their car up to 255 km/h as well as break and steer to attempt to pass their opponents and not be knocked off the road. Hitting any obstacles or other cars can cause the players vehicle to flip and crash. Players also choose between several songs, simulating a cars radio. Levels vary in location from Los Angeles, San Francisco, as well as the Greek Parthenon. Players have a simulated dashboard that indicates how far through the race they have gone, and a small checkered flag indicates when they have completed the race. The players vehicle coasts as it decelerates for five to ten seconds upon reaching races end, and then points are calculated to see how long the player has successfully driven. Rad Racer players can activate a 3D mode during play by pressing the \\"Select\\" button and wearing 3D glasses. Players could also use the Power Glove to control their vehicle. The game was also compatible with the Famicom 3D, an accessory to the original Famicom released on in Japan that utilized LCD \\"shutter glasses\\" to simulate 3D. Development The main reason for the development of the game was that Square owner Masafumi Miyamoto wanted to demonstrate Nasir Gebelli's 3D programming techniques.(February 1999). \\"The Man Behind the Fantasies\\". Next Generation, issue 50, p. 89. The game was the second game by Square the used anaglyph-based 3D. Game developer Takashi Tokita worked on Rad Racer along with Gebelli who was able to simulate the moving road in a ‚Äútricky‚Äù bit of programming. Normally programmers of the time worked on games individually, and Tokita described having someone to work with as an asset. Tokita designed and wrote the program for the billboards that appear in the game. Tokita also made all four levels ‚Äúby hand‚Äù, and during the process he learned that the middle two levels shared assets, which saved time and memory. Developer Hiromichi Tanaka also worked on ‚Äò‚ÄôRad Racer‚Äô‚Äô, and had worked on The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner with Gebelli previously. Akitoshi Kawazu‚Äôs first game at Square was Rad Racer, and designed the games ending that indicated with dots how far the player had gotten in the game. To make the roads in ‚Äò‚ÄôRad Racer‚Äô‚Äô look like they were turning in 3D on a typical television, most of which at the time used cathode ray tubes, the developers integrated scrolling by individual scanlines. This method was later utilized for game effects on the enemy Odin in Final Fantasy III.‚Äô‚Äô Hironobu Sakaguchi and Akitoshi Kawazu were both working on ‚Äò‚ÄôRad Racer‚Äô‚Äô, and as a result developer Koichi Ishii ended up working on the planning for the original Final Fantasy by himself for a time. Artist Kazuko Shibuya also worked on Rad Racer, and since the game was not programmed to display single sprites, but was drawn line by line, So Gebelli came several times a week to walk through exactly memorized schematics of how many pixels and what color the lines had to be to create roads. Ishii stayed that the sprites of 3-D Battles of WorldRunner and Rad Racer are very representative of Kazuko Shibuya‚Äôs pixel art style. To accommodate the different 3D viewing systems that were needed if players were using either a normal television or the Famicom 3D System, as well as a different version required for the PAL region, six different versions of the game had to be produced for different regions. Reception Rad Racer is considered one of the NES's premier racers. The game was met with favorable reviews and enjoyed commercial success, and sold over half a million copies. It also ranked 8th on Nintendo Powers player's poll Top 30.(July/August 1988). \\"Player's Poll Top 30\\". Nintendo Power, vol 1. Famitsu scored the game 32 out of 40, praising the sense of speed, but felt the game was a bit monotonous. Japanese publication Family Computer Magazine rated the game 20.89 of 30, and praised the variety of different game landscapes found in different levels. In their article The History of Square, GameSpot conceded that \\"Rad Racer bears more than a passing resemblance to Out Run,\\" but went on to say that \\"it's more than just a clone\\" and credited the game with \\"effectively convey[ing] the proper sense of speed.\\" Though the 3D effect created some sense of depth to the gameplay, it was hindered by a pronounced screen flickering. The article concluded that the game \\"stands on its own as a fine racing game.\\" According to Sakaguchi, Rad Racer and The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner sold \\"about 500,000 copies, which was fairly good.\\" IGN notes in their retrospective that the games simplicity and ‚Äúrace or die‚Äù focus make it one of the best racing games of its time. They also mentioned how the power glove does not improve player control, though the experience was still fun. Hardcore Gaming 101‚Äôs retrospective noted that the game has a great sense of speed and arcade levels of difficulty, but does suffer from a lack of personality and incorrect collision physics. =Legacy= Despite the efforts of Square Co. to make unique games with 3D features such as Rad Racer and 3-D Worldrunner, and high sales, the company was in financial trouble. These events are what led to a final attempt at a breakout hit, Final Fantasy. Rad Racer was ranked number 57 on IGNs Top 100 Nintendo Entertainment System games, and was called \\"iconic\\" and one of the NES's premier racing games . Maxim Magazine named the title as the number four 8-bit title of all time. Rad Racer appeared in a scene in the movie The Wizard. Rad Racer was also one of three games, including Super Mario Bros and Tetris, that were featured at the 1990 Nintendo World Championship with a special racing level to complete as one of the rounds of competition. The limited edition release of the games cartridge used in the tournament are now the rarest and most valuable Nintendo games available. Because a majority of Rad Racer sales were in the United States, Rad Racer II was made, released only for America for the NES and in arcades. The sequel featured eight new tracks and new music but similar gameplay. Hardcore Gamer 101 said that steering was looser than the first game and rival cars more aggressive, leading to a less enjoyable playing experience.

Kakabeka Falls is a waterfall on the Kaministiquia River, located beside the village of Kakabeka Falls in the municipality of Oliver Paipoonge, Ontario, west of the city of Thunder Bay. The falls have a drop of , cascading into a gorge carved out of the Precambrian Shield by meltwater following the last glacial maximum. Because of its size and ease of access, it has been consequently nicknamed \\"the Niagara of the North\\". The rock face of the falls and the escarpments along the gorge are composed primarily of unstable shale, and are eroding. These rocks host sensitive flora, and contain some of the oldest fossils in existence, some 1.6 billion years of age. Due to the fragile rock, going into the gorge below the falls is prohibited. The name \\"Kakabeka\\" comes from the Ojibwe word gakaabikaa \\"waterfall over a cliff\\" ([help]).  Kakabeka Falls Provincial Park  Kakabeka Falls Provincial Park, established in 1955, covers and is managed by Ontario Parks. It surrounds the falls and extends along the Kaministiquia River, which was used centuries ago by voyageurs, who were the first Europeans to overwinter annually in northern Ontario. They used the Kaministiquia River as a major route to the northwest, with a mountain portage around the falls. A hotel with terrace which was once located on the edge of the gorge was removed after the park's creation. It included a round restaurant that once overlooked the falls, and in winter would get covered in a thick layer of ice from the spray of the falls. The park has two campgrounds with 169 camp sites, 90 of which have electricity. The park maintains of hiking on six trails, and offers cross-country ski trails in the winter. A small Natural Heritage Education program is operated within the park in the summer, and offers daily interpretive programs, guided hikes, and a visitor centre.  Legend of Green Mantle  The Legend of Green Mantle is about an Ojibwe chief who upon hearing news of an imminent attack from the Sioux tribe instructs his daughter, Princess Green Mantle, to devise a plan to protect her people. She enters the Sioux camp along the Kaministiquia River and, pretending to be lost, she bargains with them to spare her life if she will bring them to her father's camp. Placed at the head of the canoe, she instead leads herself and the Sioux warriors over the falls to their deaths, sparing her tribe from the attack. The legend claims that one can see Green Mantle when looking into the mist of Kakabeka Falls, a monument to the princess that gave her life to save her people. Other versions of the legend say she came across the Sioux herself, and later jumped out of the canoe ahead of the falls and swam to shore, leaving the Sioux to go over the falls, then ran back to the camp to warn her people.

The most famous painting featuring the falls, painted by Lucius Richard O'Brien in 1882, is held by the National Gallery of Canada. Frances Anne Hopkins, whose historic paintings are well known for her portrayal of Canadian life, painted the portage around the falls in 1877.

They began with a peaceful protest in the heart of the city on Fountain Square over the inadequate police response to the police shooting of unarmed African American 19-year-old Timothy Thomas. The peaceful protest soon turned into a march that went in the direction of the victim's home neighborhood of Over-the-Rhine. The period of unrest was the largest urban disturbance in the United States since the 1992 Los Angeles riots until the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. The period of unrest was sparked after 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, an unarmed African American man, was shot and killed by Cincinnati Police Department Patrolman Stephen Roach during an attempt to arrest him for non- violent misdemeanors, most of which were traffic citations. Tensions were already high in the city following a series of other incidents involving police brutality and racial profiling, including thirteen deaths. Protests erupted into four nights of unrest, with incidences of recorded property destruction in Cincinnati, objects thrown at police officers by demonstrators, and vandalism and looting of businesses before a city-imposed curfew eventually ended the unrest. It was ultimately determined that the period of unrest caused $3.6 million in damage to businesses and another $1.5 to $2 million to the city. A subsequent community boycott of downtown businesses had an estimated adverse impact of $10 million on the area. Incidents of violent crime rose in the downtown area for several years thereafter. The city worked with the community and police to improve training and policies to prevent incidents like that in which Thomas was killed.  Background  The initial incident and much of the subsequent unrest began on Fountain Square in Downtown Cincinnati. Much of the subsequent unrest took place in Over-the- Rhine, the neighborhood of the victim immediately north of Cincinnati's central business district. A 2000 demographic profile of the neighborhood showed a resident population of 7,368, of whom 5,974 were African American. The profile also showed significant poverty, unemployment, and a lack of development in the area for several decades. Some 1,667 of 3,594 housing units, or more than one third, in the neighborhood were vacant. About 96 percent of the occupied houses were renter-occupied. The neighborhood had a concentration of African Americans, who otherwise made up 40 percent overall of the 331,000 residents of the city. At the time of the protests and growing unrest, the median income in Over-the-Rhine was $8,600 compared to $26,774 for the city overall. Author David Waddington attributed the poverty of the area to high unemployment resulting from a loss of manufacturing jobs in the city, as well as cuts in youth programs in the city. The neighborhood had a high rate of crimes, in particular drug-related offenses. The array of poverty- associated problems resulted in heightened tensions between African-American residents in the neighborhood and the Cincinnati Police Department. Between 1995 and April 2001, fifteen black males suspected of crimes had been killed by Cincinnati police during confrontation or while in custody, including four since November 2000, while no white suspects were killed in that period. In particular, two recent deaths had sparked tensions: Roger Owensby, Jr. died November 7, 2000, allegedly of asphyxiation from a chokehold from a police officer, and Jeffrey Irons died the next day in a scuffle with police. One of the officers was acquitted, while the other case ended in a mistrial and the officer was not re-tried. While the police were criticized for racism by the community, Heather Mac Donald wrote that \\"only three of the 15 cases raise serious questions about officer misjudgment and excessive force.\\"Heather Mac Donald, \\"What Really Happened in Cincinnati\\", City Journal, Summer 2001, accessed July 25, 2001 She said most of the deaths resulted from defensive actions by police. In the last four shootings by the department, two of which were lethal, all the police officers were black. Mac Donald also wrote that the incidence of police shootings was comparable to other cities of the same size, and below those in St. Louis, Missouri. (As of 2020, St. Louis leads the nation in police shootings.) Three weeks before the protests and growing unrest, the American Civil Liberties Union and a group of local organizations filed a civil lawsuit against the police department and city, alleging 30 years of racial profiling. A number of other civil suits were initiated against the department, including one African-American man who alleged he was handcuffed and beaten during a traffic stop. Bomani Tyehimba filed a lawsuit in 1999 against the city of Cincinnati. He claimed that during a routine traffic stop, police illegally ordered him out of his car, handcuffed him and held a gun to his head. A local independent newspaper, CityBeat, published research that an \\"analysis of 141,000 traffic citations written by Cincinnati Police in a 22-month period found black drivers twice as likely as whites to be cited for driving without a license, twice as likely to be cited for not wearing a seat belt and four times as likely to be cited for driving without proof of insurance.\\"CityBeat The NAACP argued that such statistics were the result of police targeting \\"driving while black,\\" rather than actual differences in the rate of offenses committed by different groups.  Incident  In little more than two months preceding this incident, Timothy Thomas had received numerous traffic citations: he was pulled over 11 times by six different white officers and four black officers. They cited Thomas for 21 violations, almost all of them for exactly the same things - not wearing a seat belt or driving without a license.\\"John Larson, \\"Behind the death of Timothy Thomas\\", Dateline NBC, 4/10/2004, accessed 31 March 2015 In the early morning hours of April 7, 2001, Cincinnati police in Over-the-Rhine attempted to arrest the 19-year-old, who was wanted on 14 nonviolent misdemeanor counts, of which 12 were traffic citations. Thomas was pursued for 10 minutes by nine officers, who were later joined by Patrolman Stephen Roach. The pursuit culminated at 2:20 a.m. when Thomas rounded a corner in a dark alley and surprised Roach, who shot him in the chest at close range. Roach said he believed Thomas was reaching for a gun in his waistband, but investigation later determined Thomas was trying to pull up his \\"baggy pants.\\" Roach also said that he was not aware that charges against Thomas were non-violent, and that Thomas ignored an order to stop. Thomas was rushed to a hospital, but died of his wounds.  Disturbance  The shooting of an unarmed teenager, Timothy Thomas, sparked widespread outrage in the city, especially in Over- the-Rhine. On April 9, a group of 200 protesters brandishing signs, including Thomas' mother Angela Leisure, gathered outside Cincinnati City Hall while the city council was in session, to demand public explanation for Thomas' shooting. The protesters also demanded to know the results of the police investigation of the shooting, but were told the department was not ready and was still investigating. The council members stayed inside city hall for three hours and did not respond to the crowd's demands. Later that evening, several hundred residents gathered outside the Cincinnati Police District 1 headquarters in Over-the-Rhine and confronted a line of police officers on horseback and in police cruisers. For about an hour, the crowd threw stones and bottles at police, smashed the station's front door, pulled the station flag from its mast and re-hung it upside down. Police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, bean bags and rubber bullets. Ten arrests were made during the incident. Cincinnati Mayor Charles J. Luken issued a citywide curfew that largely ended the period of unrest. On the afternoon of April 10, the unrest resumed after a static protest on Fountain Square. Approximately 20 to 30 African-Americans moved through city streets towards Over the Rhine, soon followed by police officers. At two road intersections, the crowd began throwing bottles and garbage at police, who retreated both times. Parts of the crowd headed back downtown, where they began to overturn garbage cans, vendor carts, and newspaper boxes. The crowd began smashing windows of businesses and looting stores. Police moved in on horseback or with linked arms and dispersed the crowd with bean bags, tear gas and rubber bullets. They made sixty-six arrests of protesters over the course of the day. The city called in deputies from the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office to help when looting and vandalism broke out in other poorer neighborhoods in Cincinnati, including Walnut Hills and Avondale, where vandals broke windows and set small fires. Several gunshots were fired during the night, and there were a number of injuries reported in the incidents. Participants in the period of unrest dispersed in the early morning hours. Many of the damaged downtown businesses resumed normal operations the next day. But, at nightfall on April 11, another interval of unrest broke out downtown as nothing had yet been done in retribution for this murder, and more businesses were damaged and looted. A number of white motorists were allegedly pulled from their cars and beaten. Sporadic incidents continued the next evening, and a police crackdown resulted in another 82 arrests. By April 12, many downtown businesses did not open, and workers for many others refused to go downtown. A third night of unrest continued that evening, causing further damage. The morning of April 13, Cincinnati Mayor Charles J. Luken announced a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. for all but work travelers. He also declared a state of emergency and brought in 125 Ohio Highway Patrol troopers to assist with policing. In all, 800 people were arrested for violating curfew conditions. This curfew did not extend to the city's suburbs, prompting some criticism from Cincinnati residents of uneven enforcement of the curfew. April 14 was the day of Timothy Thomas' funeral. Police kept a helicopter airborne and stationed police two blocks from the service. About 2,000 protesters began a peaceful march downtown following the service. A procession of 30 from the funeral marched to the intersection of Elm and Liberty streets. A group of seven law enforcement personnel arrived in patrol cruisers and fired bean bag ammunition into a crowd of 20, injuring four, including two children. Police contended they were acting under orders to disperse a large crowd blocking the intersection, while witnesses claimed the police did not provide warning and singled out black members of the group.  Aftermath  The total damage sustained from the period of protest and unrest amounted to $3.6 million. In all, the city said 120 businesses experienced damage due to the civil unrest. It cost the city another $1.5 million to $2 million for emergency responders and equipment damage. The four days of protest and unrest are considered the largest urban disturbance in the United States since the 1992 Los Angeles period of unrest. There has been extensive discussion within the local community about the effects of suburbanization and urban decay in the city, as well as the redevelopment of Over-the-Rhine, a historic neighborhood. The incidents again strained the relationship between the police and residents of the city's minority communities. In 2002, the city signed an agreement for initiatives to improve police service to minority communities, revise use-of-force guidelines and form a committee for community policing initiatives. CPD officers began an unofficial work slowdown, which coincided with a rise in violent crime in the downtown area. In 2001 and 2002, violent crime and property crime rates rose in the city, with property crime rates peaking in 2003 before declining through 2010. The city has a crime rate higher than the national average but similar to other major cities. Initiatives were subsequently begun by community groups to reduce violence. Sixty-three participants of the protest involved with property destruction and/or violence were indicted on felony charges.McCain, Marie. \\"Grand jury indicts 63 in looting, violence,\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer, 21 April 2001. 29 October 2006 . Roach was tried for negligent homicide in September 2001. Cincinnati police attempted to waive the trial in favor of a bench ruling. Roach, who left the force to join a suburban police department, was later acquitted of the charges. Several isolated incidents of civil unrest occurred after his verdict was announced. An internal police investigation found Roach had lied in his incident report, had not followed department firearm procedures, and had not given Thomas sufficient time to respond to his order. Angered by police reaction, particularly the April 14 incident, several community groups organized a boycott of downtown businesses. Several prominent African-American entertainers scheduled to perform in the city, including Bill Cosby, Whoopi Goldberg, and Smokey Robinson cancelled their performances there. After a year, the community boycott was estimated to have caused a $10 million negative economic impact on the city. Significant gentrification of the Over the Rhine community began just before and continued after the period of civil unrest, as developers found property values low enough to allow acquisition and redevelopment. A number of tech companies and nightlife spots have opened in the neighborhood. By 2007, several new community events had been organized. Several large Cincinnati companies, including Fifth Third Bank, Procter & Gamble and Kroger, announced support for reforms in the city, such as investment in schools and minority-hiring programs. Police behavior and protocols were investigated, and changes were made to improve training and interaction with the community. On the ten-year anniversary of the protests and civil unrest, Cincinnati Enquirer reported that \\"[t]he riots neither initiated the racial tension nor the police reforms, but accelerated both.\\"Jane Predergast, Cincinnati riots anniversary, Cincinnati Enquirer (April 3, 2011). Among the reforms were the following: * Training officers to deal with \\"low-light situations\\" (such as the alley where Timothy Thomas was fatally shot). * Training officers to how to recognize suspects' potential mental health issues and how to interact with mentally ill people. * Cincinnati patrol cars were equipped with computers to give police officers access to complete and detailed criminal records. * Changes in the department's \\"foot pursuit policy,\\" requiring officers to \\"assess whether a pursuit is appropriate, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offense, whether the suspect is armed and their ability to apprehend at a later date.\\" * Requiring officers to complete \\"contact cards\\" after traffic stops, noting details about the car's driver and passengers, including race. This change arose from complaints of racial profiling in traffic stops. * The Citizens Complaint Authority was created in 2002 to independently review all \\"serious uses of force\\" by police officers. * In late 2003 the city 'updated Tasers for all officers after the death of Nathaniel Jones, an African- American man with drugs in his system.\\" Jones died after officers \\"hit him repeatedly with their batons.\\" See also * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References ;Citations ;Sources  * * Cincinnati riots Cincinnati riots Cincinnati Category:African-American history in Cincinnati Category:2000s in Cincinnati Category:Riots and civil disorder in Cincinnati Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:April 2001 events in the United States Category:History of racism in Ohio Category:Black Lives Matter ","title":"Cincinnati riots of 2001"},{"id":"892919","text":"James Edward Ryan (February 11, 1863 ‚Äì October 29, 1923), nicknamed \\"Pony\\", was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball who played eighteen seasons between 1885 and 1903, primarily for the Chicago White Stockings/Colts/Orphans (1885‚Äì1889, 1891‚Äì1900). He held the major league record for career assists by an outfielder (375) from 1900 to 1924. A native of Clinton, Massachusetts, Ryan enjoyed his best season in 1888, leading the National League (NL) in home runs (16), hits (182), doubles (33), total bases (283) and slugging percentage (.515), and also was second in batting average (.332), runs (115) and extra base hits (59). In that season, he also hit for the cycle on July 28. Ryan also appeared in that game as a pitcher, becoming the first player in major league history to hit for the cycle and pitch in the same game. The White Stockings beat the Detroit Wolverines 21‚Äì17. (Larry Twitchell of Cleveland pitched while hitting for the cycle on Aug. 15, 1889.) Ryan's baseball card, circa 1888 Ryan switched to the Chicago Pirates in 1890, the only season of the Players' League, and ended his career with the Washington Senators (1902‚Äì03) in the American League. In 1900, his final season in Chicago, he broke Tom Brown's record of 348 career assists by an outfielder; Tris Speaker broke his record in 1924. Ryan was a .308 career hitter with 118 home runs and 1093 runs batted in in 2014 games. As a pitcher, he compiled a 6‚Äì1 record with 43 strikeouts and a 3.62 Earned run average in 117 innings. On the tough side, Ryan was one of the few players to punch a reporter at least twice. After his first episode, in 1887, Charlie Seymour of the Chicago Herald wrote, \\"Ryan slugged the magnificent Chicago reporter in Pittsburg[h] the other day.\\" In the other, in 1892, he took exception to George Beachel of the Chicago Daily News. In the clubhouse after a game, Ryan \\"picked a quarrel with [Beachel], and then attacked him, using him up pretty badly. No arrests have been made.\\" In 1896, he punched a train conductor after losing his place and his teammates had gone to bed. A conductor who intervened was \\"called down by Mr. Ryan, who got in one upper cut before [his longtime- captain manager Cap] Anson stopped the fun\\", wrote Tim Murnane of the Boston Globe., p. 268. Ryan, in an article under his byline in 1905, advised against baseball as a profession, because few players last long enough in the big leagues to make money: \\"Baseball is not a permanent business. Look in the newspapers and you will see that a baseball player 35 years of age is considered an old man.\\" Ryan died in Chicago at age 60.

History =Second World War= RAF Dishforth opened in 1936. At the beginning of the Second World War it became part of 4 Group, RAF Bomber Command, and was used for recruit training. Between September 1939 and April 1941, No. 78 Squadron RAF used it to launch night operations using Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers. Between 1943 and 1945 the station was used by No. 6 (RCAF) Group Bomber Command and was a sub-station of RAF Topcliffe. Immediately after the war the station was used to convert aircrew to the Douglas Dakota transport aircraft. =Post war= In the late 1950s RAF Transport Command operated Handley Page Hastings and from 1957 30 Squadron operated the Blackburn Beverley from Dishforth. From 1962 to 1966 Dishforth was home to Leeds University Air Squadron flying the de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk T Mk 10.

During a 21-year baseball career, he played for four different teams as a center and right fielder, spending most of his career with the Montreal Expos (1976‚Äì1986) and Chicago Cubs (1987‚Äì1992). An 8-time National League (NL) All-Star, he was named the league's Rookie of the Year in after batting .282 with 19 home runs and 65 runs batted in (RBI), and won the Most Valuable Player Award in after leading the league with 49 homers and 137 RBI; he had been runner-up for the award in both 1981 and 1983. He batted .300 five times, drove in 100 runs four times and had 13 seasons of 20 home runs. A strong base-runner early in his career, he also stole 30 bases three times. He is one of eight MLB players with at least 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases during his career. Dawson was a center fielder until knee problems ‚Äì worsened by the artificial surface at Olympic Stadium ‚Äì forced his shift to right field, followed by his move to a team which played on grass. He led the NL in outfield putouts three consecutive years (1981‚Äì1983), and won eight Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence. Dawson was known for his incredible work ethic and study of the game. He was often seen in the dugout with a clipboard in-hand documenting pitches and pitcher tendencies. This was long before such practices were common-place and such information was readily available. Upon his retirement, his NL totals of 409 home runs and 962 extra base hits both ranked tenth in league history; he also ranked seventh in NL history in games as an outfielder (2,303), and sixth in both outfield putouts (5,116) and total chances (5,366). He set Expos franchise records for career games, at bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, runs batted in, extra base hits, total bases and steals, all of which have since been broken variously by Tim Raines, Tim Wallach and Vladimir Guerrero. Dawson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 2010.Blum, Ronald, Mike Fitzpatrick and Adam Pemble. \\"With Dawson in Hall, Future Bright for Blyleven\\" . Associated Press. January 7, 2010. Career =Montreal Expos= Dawson was selected by the Expos in the 11th round (pick #250) of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft. He played in 24 major league games in 1976 after making his debut on September 11. His stardom rose in 1977 when he became an everyday outfielder for the Expos, and batted .282 with 19 home runs and 21 stolen bases. He was awarded the 1977 Rookie of the Year in the National League, narrowly beating out Steve Henderson of the New York Mets. Dawson had a blend of power and speed, hitting at least 20 home runs in seven seasons with the Expos, and stealing at least 20 bases in his first seven seasons. Dawson, playing primarily center field for the Expos, also became an excellent defensive player, gaining his first of eight Gold Glove Awards in . Based on his all-around excellence, Dawson was second in the National League MVP voting in 1981 (won by Mike Schmidt) and second again in 1983 (won by Dale Murphy). He was voted the Montreal Expos Player of the Year in 1981 and 1983. Dawson played 1,443 games with the Expos, fourth highest in franchise history. As an Expo, Dawson set single-season club records for home runs (32, now seventh), RBI (113, now fourth), extra base hits (78, now seventh), and sacrifice flies (18, still first). He still holds the Expos career record for sacrifice flies (71), and is the only player to hit 200 home runs and steal 200 bases with Montreal. During his Expo days, Dawson hit two home runs in the same inning twice: at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium against the Atlanta Braves on July 30, 1978 and at Wrigley Field against his future team, the Chicago Cubs, on September 24, 1985. As of 2019, Dawson, Willie McCovey, Jeff King, Alex Rodriguez, and Edwin Encarnacion are the only five players who had hit two home runs in one inning twice. In 1984 Dawson appeared in The Cap, a short film about a young boy living in Montreal that was given a baseball cap by Dawson. =Chicago Cubs= Dawson in right field at Wrigley Field, August 1988. Dawson played for the Expos until after the 1986 season when he became a free agent and sought a team whose home field had natural grass, as his knee injuries were aggravated by Olympic Stadium's artificial turf. However, due to collusion on the part of the Major League Baseball owners, he was unable to attract offers. Dawson campaigned for the Cubs to sign him during the off- season, but general manager Dallas Green resisted, insisting that the Cubs would start Brian Dayett in right field (Dawson had moved from center field to right field in his final two seasons as an Expo, due to the condition of his knees), and that one player could not make a 71‚Äì91 team a 91‚Äì71 team. When the Cubs opened camp in Mesa, Arizona that spring, Dawson and his agent Dick Moss arrived with a signed blank contract in an attempt to secure a contract with the Cubs. Dawson and Moss' stunt was derided as a \\"dog and pony show\\" by Green. After reviewing the contract, Green reached an agreement with Moss on a salary of $500,000 ($ in today's dollars), second-lowest on the team among regulars, and added bonuses of $150,000 if he did not go on the disabled list by the All-Star Game break and $50,000 if he made the All-Star team. He earned both. The team also wrote in $100,000 bonuses if Dawson was MVP of either the league championship series or the World Series, but did not add a clause for National League MVP. While he won the NL MVP, the Cubs did not make the playoffs, so he had no chance to earn the NLCS or World Series MVP.Note that Bill James considers Dawson's best years to be from 1979 to 1983, with his higher Chicago numbers being due to Wrigley Field's advantageous environment for hitters (James 2001). He became the Cubs' starting right fielder, and hit a major league leading 49 home runs (equal with Oakland Athletics rookie Mark McGwire) and was named the league's MVP, finally winning after the two years as runner-up in Montreal. He also earned his fourth All-Star nod and won the Home Run Derby that year. Nonetheless, Dawson wasn't able to turn around the Cubs' fortunes: although the team held first place for nearly half of May and remained in contention through July, the Cubs finished the 1987 season 76‚Äì85, last in the National League East. Dawson was the first player to ever win a league MVP trophy from a last place team. Dawson played five more seasons with the Cubs, and was one of the franchise's most popular players during that time. His worst individual season came in 1989, when the Cubs won the National League East title. Then, during the NL Championship Series, Dawson slumped terribly, hitting .105 as the San Francisco Giants beat the Cubs 4 games to 1. Dawson's .507 career slugging percentage with the Cubs is fourth highest in team history. =Late and post career= Dawson in 2009. In October 1992 the Red Sox signed Dawson as a free agent.Edes, Gordon. \\"Dawson Had the Tools to Build a Solid Case\\". boston.com. January 10, 2006. Dawson hit his 400th career home run with the Red Sox on April 15 at Fenway Park. Dawson sustained a knee injury early in the 1993 season in a game against the Texas Rangers which limited him to only 121 games in his first year with the Red Sox: \\"I got caught between sliding and standing up on a passed ball. I was on second base, and I took a chop step between strides and hit the corner of the third-base bag. I had knee surgery and [Boston] decided to use me in the DH role.\\" Dawson would have knee surgery the following year as well, and only managed to play 75 games in his second and final season with Boston. Dawson played his last two years with the Florida Marlins, where he played sparingly, retiring after the 1996 season. In his final game, Dawson was removed from the field as a final farewell to the fans and the game. The fans gave him a standing ovation as Dawson walked off the field. He returned to the Marlins shortly thereafter when he accepted a position in the team's front office, where Dawson got his first World Series ring in 2003. Dawson also owns The Mahogany Grille, a soul food restaurant in Miami Gardens, Florida, and the Paradise Memorial Funeral Home in Richmond Heights, Florida. He entered the funeral business in 2003, investing in a funeral home his younger brother owned, and became the owner and operator of Paradise Memorial in 2008. In an April 2020 Associated Press story on how he and his business were having to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, he noted, \\"It‚Äôs very sad. Because people mourn and grieve differently, and they‚Äôre not getting through that process as they would under normal circumstances. You see a lot of hurt and pain.\\" At the time of the story, his wife of 42 years, Vanessa, was the office manager, while an uncle ran day-to-day operations.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob- nightengale/2018/05/08/andre-dawson-hall-famer-funeral-home-florida- retirement/590358002/https://www.npr.org/2020/05/09/853216982/baseball-star- andre-dawson-on-running-a-funeral-home-during-the-pandemic Dawson has regularly attended Chicago Cubs functions since his retirement, and is a fan favorite. Dawson has appeared in a \\"Discount Double-Check\\" commercial for State Farm Insurance that features former Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood. Dawson released his autobiography If You Love This Game: An MVP's Life in Baseball in May 2012. =Accomplishments= Dawson finished his career with 2,774 hits, 438 home runs, 314 stolen bases, and 1,591 RBI. He is one of only eight players in major league history to record over 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases in his career (300-300 club); the other players to accomplish this are Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Reggie Sanders, Steve Finley, Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Beltr√°n. Dawson is also one of only five members of the 400 HR-300 SB club, along with Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez, and Carlos Beltr√°n. In 1997, Dawson's #10 was retired by the Montreal Expos in his honor (the number had been previously retired for Rusty Staub). After the franchise moved to Washington, the Montreal Canadiens raised a banner in the Bell Centre to commemorate all of the retired Expos numbers, including Dawson's. In 2010 the Washington Nationals franchise placed Dawson in its \\"Ring of Honor\\" at Nationals Park. In 2019, Dawson was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame Andre Dawson's signature Dawson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010, his ninth year of eligibility, rising from an initial vote total of 45.3% in 2002 to 77.9% in 2010. Dawson's Hall of Fame plaque depicts him with a Montreal Expos cap. The major impediments to Dawson's election to the Hall of Fame had been his ordinary career .323 on-base percentage, his statistics being diminished in stature by sluggers who played after him in the steroid era, and never playing in a World Series. Cubs teammate Ryne Sandberg campaigned for Dawson's induction during his speech at his own Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2005: \\"No player in baseball history worked harder, suffered more or did it better than Andre Dawson. He's the best I've ever seen. I watched him win an MVP for a last-place team in 1987 [with the Cubs], and it was the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in baseball. He did it the right way, the natural way, and he did it in the field and on the bases and in every way, and I hope he will stand up here someday.\\" Dawson was the second player in the Hall of Fame whose plaque depicts him with an Expos logo, after Gary Carter. Although Dawson had played the majority of his 21-year career with Montreal, he publicly expressed his disappointment with the decision, saying it was \\"a little gut-wrenching\\" to find out he would not go in as a Chicago Cub. Dawson's reluctance to be enshrined as an Expo stemmed, in part, from the breakdown of his relationship with the team during MLB's collusion scandal of 1986‚Äì87, when he claims the team not only \\"threw him out\\" of Montreal, but tried to prevent other teams from signing him as a free agent. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987. The Hall noted that \\"Dawson had 1,575 of his 2,774 hits as an Expo, won six of his eight Gold Glove awards in Montreal and led the Expos to their only postseason series win\\". Nickname Dawson's nickname, \\"The Hawk\\", was given to him by an uncle at a very early age. Andre used to work out with a men's team that would hit him ground balls at practice. Andre's uncle told him that most kids his age would shy away from the ball, but Andre attacked the ball like a hawk.

Being divided from mainland Jutland by the Limfjord, it is technically a part of the North Jutlandic Island. Vendsyssel is part of the North Denmark Region. Limfjord separating Vendsyssel from mainland Jutland Vendsyssel neighbours Hanherred to the southwest and Himmerland to the south, across the Limfjord. Whether the island L√¶s√∏ is also a part of Vendsyssel, is a matter of definition. The major towns of Vendsyssel are Hj√∏rring, Frederikshavn, Br√∏nderslev, S√¶by, Hirtshals, L√∏kken, N√∏rresundby and, on its northern tip, Skagen. The dominating city is, however, Aalborg which is mainly situated outside Vendsyssel on the southern shore of the Limfjord with N√∏rresundby as a secondary, northern centre. Etymology Adam of Bremen (ca. 1075) calls Vendsyssel Wendila, √Ülnoth (ca. 1100) calls it Wendel, the Icelandic literature Vendill. Derived from this is the ethnic name w√¶ndlar, Danish vendelboer, which is part of the name of the syssel. In the Danish Census Book (Kong Valdemars Jordebog, ca. 1231) W√¶ndlesys√¶l, Wendelsysel, W√¶ndil. Presumably originally the name of the Limfjord, then name of the region north of it. According to historians and linguists, the name Vendsyssel may be derived from the Germanic tribe of the Vandals. Syssel is an ancient form of administrative region. Vendel (Old Danish W√¶ndil) was also the ancient name of the Limfjord itself.

Infrastructure Vendsyssel is an important gatehead for transport from the European continent to Norway and Western Sweden. The European routes E39 and E45 cross the area as motorways. National route 11 connects Vendsyssel with Hanherred and Thy before crossing the Limfjord to western Jutland on the Oddesund Bridge.

Concatenative programming replaces function application, which is common in other programming styles, with function composition as the default way to build subroutines. Example For example, a sequence of operations in an applicative language like the following: y = foo(x) z = bar(y) w = baz(z) ...is written in a concatenative language as a sequence of functions, without parameters: foo bar baz Functions and procedures written in concatenative style are not value level, i.e. they typically do not represent the data structures they operate on with explicit names or identifiers; instead they are function level - a function is defined as a pipeline, a sequence of operations that take parameters from an implicit data structure on which all functions operate, and return the function results to that shared structure so that it will be used by the next operator. The combination of a compositional semantics with a syntax that mirrors such a semantics makes concatenative languages highly amenable to algebraic manipulation of programs; although it may be difficult to write mathematical expressions directly in them. Concatenative languages can be implemented in an efficient way with a stack machine, and are commonly present implicitly in virtual machines in the form of their instruction sets. Much of the original work on concatenative language theory was carried out by Manfred von Thun. Properties The properties of concatenative languages are the result of their compositional syntax and semantics: * The reduction of any expression is the simplification of one function to another function; it is never necessary to deal with the application of functions to objects. * Any subexpression can be replaced with a name that represents the same subexpression. This is referred to in the concatenative community as factoring and is used extensively to simplify programs into smaller parts. * The syntax and semantics of concatenative languages form the algebraic structure of a monoid. * Concatenative languages can be made well-suited to an implementation inspired by linear logic where no garbage is ever generated. Implementations The first concatenative programming language was Forth, although Joy was the first language to call itself concatenative. Other concatenative languages are Factor, Onyx, PostScript, and RPL. Most existing concatenative languages are stack-based; this is not a requirement and other models have been proposed. Concatenative languages are currently used for embedded, desktop, and web programming, as target languages, and for research purposes. Most concatenative languages are dynamically typed. Exceptions include the statically typed Cat language.

The city has a total population of 6,901 (as of March 2014), and by population, is the largest locality in Gozo. The area around the town, situated on a hill near the centre of the island, has been settled since Neolithic times. Victoria is the name given on 10 June 1887 by the British government on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, at the request of Pietro Monsignor Pace, Bishop of Gozo (Monsignor Pace later became Sir Pietro Monsignor Pace, Titular Archbishop of Rhodes and Bishop of Malta). However, many Gozitans, mainly older Gozitans, still often refer to it by the name Rabat. It is usually known as Rabat, Gozo to distinguish it from the town of Rabat on the main island of Malta.

It was later developed by the Phoenicians and continued into becoming a complex Acropolis by Roman times. The north side of the Citadel dates back to the Aragonese domination period. The south flank, overlooking Victoria, was re- constructed under the Knights of St. John, namely between 1599 and 1603, after Ottomans invaded the city in 1551. The massive defensive stone walls of the fortifications rise above the town and were built by the Knights to protect the village communities from foraging corsairs attempting to take slaves and threatened invasion of Moslem forces fighting Christendom. Within its walls lies a fine 17th century baroque Cathedral designed by Lorenzo Gaf√†, the Maltese architect who also built the Cathedral of Mdina. It is said that it lies on the site where a Roman temple dedicated to Juno once stood. It is most famous for the remarkable trompe l'oeil painting on its ceiling, which depicts the interior of a dome that was never built.

File:GozoCathedral.JPGThe exterior of the Cathedral of Assumption. =St George's Parish= St. George's Basilica, Malta, which covers the whole of Victoria, caters for a little over half of the population of Victoria, as it is a personal parish (as opposed to other parishes who are territorial) operating in the city of Victoria. Its parish church dedicated to St George has the status of a Basilica. This church was built in the 1670s and suffered severe damage in the earthquake of 1693. A new fa√ßade was built in 1818. The dome and the aisles are of recent construction (1930s and 1940s). There are several works of art in this church which include the painting of the dome and ceiling by Gian Battista Conti of Rome and other paintings and sculptures by Mattia Preti, Giuseppe d'Arena, Stefano Erardi, Alessio Erardi, Francesco V. Zahra, Giuseppe Cal√¨, and contemporary Alfred Camilleri Cauchi and John L. Grima. The titular statue of St George was carved from solid wood by Pietro Paolo Azzopardi in 1838 and is the first titular statue on the island. The area over which the church is built is of considerable archaeological interest, with evidence of activity dating back to at least to the Roman period. The parish celebrates two feasts during the year: 23 April, the official date celebrating the death of the martyr, and the third Sunday of July, when the solemn festivities in honour of Gozo's patron saint are held. In February 2013, the Basilica opened the doors to its new modern museum, one of a kind in the country. It is the first building built for the purpose of a museum. The Museum and cultural centre, named as Heart of Gozo: Il-Hagar, displays a rich collection of historical and artistic artefacts previously inaccessible to the general public. The museum is found on the left side of the Basilica. File:Sudika San Gorg Rabat-2.jpgSaint George's Basilica.

For the mythical Chinese character, see Sun Wukong. Monkey and Al (portrayed by Johnny Vegas), as shown on one of ITV Digital's adverts Monkey (also known as The Monkey, ITV Digital Monkey or PG Tips Monkey, and often pronounced /'mu≈ãkŒµ/ in imitation of Johnny Vegas' Lancashire accent), is an animated puppet advertising character in the form of a knitted sock monkey. He was first produced by The Jim Henson Company via their UK Creature Shop, puppeteered by Nigel Plaskitt and Susan Beattie and voiced by comedian Ben Miller. Monkey has appeared in advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom for both the defunct television company ITV Digital and the tea brand PG Tips, as well as being occasionally featured in TV programmes. Monkey is notable as one of a small number of advertising characters to eclipse the popularity of the product they advertise and also to be reused to advertise a completely different product.The Guardian: \\"Vegas & Monkey: A welcome revival\\" ITV Digital A series of high-profile adverts for ITV Digital featured the laid-back, droll and composed Monkey (in a variety of T-shirts) playing the straight man to the comedian Johnny Vegas's womanizer of a character \\"Al\\". Monkey was one of the few positive public relations successes of ITV Digital. Purchasers of ITV Digital were sent a free soft toy Monkey with their subscription. For a period during the advertising campaign and after ITV Digital's bankruptcy, the original promotional Monkey toys were in high demand and short supply. One sold for ¬£150 at the bankruptcy auction and they were selling for several hundred pounds on eBay,Silicon.com: ITV Monkey funds TV shopping start-up where customers could also find replica Monkey knitting patterns delivered by email selling for several pounds. Later, The Gadget Shop purchased the remaining promotional toys from ITV Digital's liquidators and sold them through their retail stores. These saw a boost in popularity after an appearance in the second series of award-winning British sitcom The Office. Legal dispute As Monkey was created and owned by advertising agency Mother rather than by ITV Digital itself, he was the subject of a legal dispute as both claimed the rights to the character. This prevented his use for some time, despite many organisations being keen to acquire the rights. The dispute was eventually resolved by both parties agreeing to donate the intellectual property rights for Monkey to Comic Relief. Following the resolution of the dispute, Monkey appeared in a few TV shows, with the BBC using him for 2001's Comic Relief, as well as making a guest appearance at the 2002 BRIT Awards. In both cases Monkey appeared without Johnny Vegas. In 2003, the BBC commissioned a variety show to be hosted by Monkey. A pilot was filmed titled \\"Watch with Monkey\\" and featured Dawn French and the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain. The pilot has never been televised. PG Tips Promotional poster of A Tale of Two Continents In January 2007, Monkey and Vegas reprised their double act in a new series of advertisements for PG Tips tea. The first advertisement was named \\"The Return\\" and the adverts make reference to PG Tips' popular series of adverts featuring live chimps which ran between 1956 and 2002, as well as to ITV Digital going out of business (on which low audience figures, piracy issues and an ultimately unaffordable multi-million pound deal with the Football League led to the broadcaster suffering massive losses, forcing it to enter administration in March 2002). PG launched a website selling the newly branded \\"PG Monkey\\" merchandise with profits being donated to Comic Relief, who still own the intellectual property rights. The online shop has since closed but during promotions PG Tips have given away free mini-Monkeys packaged with their tea. =Mini movie= Monkey also appeared in a short advertising film which was shown in cinemas at the beginning of selected showings of Horton Hears a Who, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Hannah Montana 3D and The Game Plan. The film was released on 21 March 2008. The film is called A Tale of Two Continents and has Monkey portraying various historical figures as he attempts to make the perfect cup of tea in the Kenya tea farms and then safely take it across the world to England for The Queen. The film was also given away on DVD with special packs of PG Tips tea. Characteristics =Early life= In Monkey - Hero of Our Time, Monkey writes that his \\"parents owned a toy shop\\"; however, this was forced into closure in '1982'. He said \\"[a]s my parents were clearing away and throwing out what was left of the stock, my mother came across me, stuck behind a pile of empty cardboard boxes\\" and \\"[s]he took me home and painstakingly restored me back to my former glory - cleaning me, re- stuffing me and sewing me up. Her love for me was so great that I amazingly found myself able to move and speak.\\" Soon afterwards he claimed that his first words to her were \\"Put the kettle on, eh Mum? I'm parched.\\". =Personality and habits= Monkey is sometimes portrayed as being quite cowardly; for example his refusal to take responsibility for dropping a ceramic bowl dating back to 3000 BC, despite being filmed doing so. He is also prone to miserliness, having admitted that he re-uses discarded plasters he finds in swimming pools.A Tale of Two continents Monkey hoards both his and Al's wages, deliberately neglecting to inform the naive Al of the fact that they are in fact paid for their work, stating \\"I don't bother Al with details\\" and that his money is \\"safely invested in a portfolio of bananas\\".PG Tips ad- Monkey and Al interview Despite his turbulent relationship with Al, the two share the same bed. Monkey is shown to be very passionate about tea, his favourite serving method being \\"three stirs clockwise, two stirs back, one and three quarters sugars\\".PG Tips Monkey ad#1 The Return He vehemently insists that tea bags should precede milk when brewing. His exact species is never clarified; Monkey himself denies being a chimpanzee (the CHimp logo on his tea-shirt puns on CH sounding like the Chinese word for tea), and his response to Al's idea that he may be \\"half monkey-half chimp\\" is limited to \\"speak for yourself\\". Though he claims to be a \\"ladies' monkey\\", he is caught by Al surfing dating sites, giving exaggerated descriptions of his physical appearance.ITV Digital Monkey ad#5 Monkey and Al go Interactive He is sometimes shown wearing a woman's nightcap,ITV Digital Monkey Ad #11 - Drilling a sheath dressPG Tips Range - PG Tips Rainforest Alliance advert and a ballet tutu.PG Tips Monkey advert#4- Spoons He gets distressed if tea is made in the wrong order.

With some active bands and artists it is still present. It encompasses elements from punk, grunge and experimental pop, and intellectual lyrics. It established new grounds for the use of German language in pop music.  Introduction  As the name indicates, the movement was initially carried by Hamburg based bands like , Kolossale Jugend, Ostzonensuppenw√ºrfelmachenkrebs, Die Erde, Blumfeld, Selig, Tocotronic, Die Sterne, , and Die Goldenen Zitronen. Their music didn't necessarily sound similar, but was characterised by lyrics in German language (not a given in Germany) that gave voice to social criticism and were based on post-modern theory. Consequently, it was lauded by the leftist trade press (especially Spex magazine). The artists themselves didn't initially perceive these similarities to be particularly important and denied the existence of a homogeneous movement. However, social links and political cooperations suggest that it wasn't unreasonable to view it as that. Furthermore, it could be surmised that the term Hamburger Schule is a pun on the so-called Frankfurter Schule ('Frankfurt School') which is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research, and philosophy, centered at the Institute for Social Research (Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung) of the University of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. However, it seems more likely to be simply a clever knock at the need for legitimacy, by referencing the way all art movements are titled in German (e.g. Wiener Schule, Berliner Schule, √ñsterreichische Schule, New Yorker Schule, etc.).  Beginnings  In the late 1980s, a new musical scene was emerging in Hamburg comprising a number of bands that sung in German but that had no record deals (with the exception of Die Antwort). To remedy this situation and to give the new style a platform, the record label L'Age D'Or was established in October 1988 by Carol von Rautenkranz and Pascal Fuhlbr√ºgge. They signed contracts with many bands and published numerous albums. Many of the albums were produced by Chris von Rautenkranz, Carol's brother, in the Soundgarden recording studio in Hamburg. Another label that influenced the emerging genre was Alfred Hilsberg's What's So Funny About?, which published the first albums by Blumfeld, , and Die Erde. Another significant representative of Hamburger Schule was Andreas Mand.CD Eine kleine Feile ('A Little File'). Retrieved 2011-12-13 (german) Soon, however, the Hamburger Schule was not restricted to Hamburg anymore. In particular, a local scene of germanophone bands had developed in the small town of Bad Salzuflen in Eastern Westphalia, which was centered on the label Fast Weltweit. Founders were Frank Werner, Frank Spilker (of the band Die Sterne), Michael Girke, Bernadette La Hengst (of Die Braut haut ins Auge) and Jochen Distelmeyer (then of Bienenj√§ger, later Blumfeld). They got in contact with the Hamburg scene through Bernd Begemann who was a native of Bad Salzuflen but moved to Hamburg where he established his band Die Antwort. This led to various gigs in Hamburg for bands from the Fast Weltweit label, eventually causing many other artists to move to Hamburg. Another first-generation Hamburger Schule band, Die Regierung, was based in Hamburg for a long time, but originated from Essen.  Rise and fall  By the mid 1990s, three bands met with great commercial success: Blumfeld, Die Sterne, and Tocotronic. The Hamburger Schule became known as the epitome of German indie pop music. When other German guitar bands, whose music and lyrics were of a different style, were able to profit from this success, however, a new nationwide Indie pop scene emerged. The Hamburger Schule began to be marginalised by a movement which it had helped to create. Other artists that are considered part of the Hamburger Schule are Milch, Rocko Schamoni and the 'Mobylettes'. But as time went by, the term eventually encompassed such a broad spectrum of musical content that it could hardly be associated with a particular musical genre anymore. As several bands have started to sing in foreign languages, it has begun to lose any meaning it once had.  Revival  By the end of the 1990s, there emerged a new wave of German guitar music with intellectual aspirations. Examples for this new generation of artists, who clearly tie in with the Hamburger Schule tradition, are Spillsbury, Kettcar, Erdm√∂bel, Kajak, Justin Balk, , Astra Kid, Modus Noa, Marr and Tomte. They display a new musical homogeneity of punk-influenced guitar pop. Several small labels have sprung up to support this new musical current. Arguably the most important one is the Hamburg-based label Grand Hotel van Cleef which, like L'Age D'Or seeks to be an enabler for local bands. It was established in September 2002 by Tomte's Thees Uhlmann and Kettcar's Marcus Wiebusch and Reimer Bustorff.

New Swabia was explored by Germany in early 1939 and named after that expedition's ship, , itself named after the German region of Swabia.McGonigal, David, Antarctica, frances lincoln ltd, 2009, , , p 367 Background Like many other countries, Germany sent expeditions to the Antarctic region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of which were scientific. The late 19th century expeditions to the Southern Ocean, South Georgia, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Crozet Islands were astronomical, meteorological, and hydrological, mostly in close collaboration with scientific teams from other countries. As the 19th century ended Germany began to focus on Antarctica. The first German expedition to Antarctica was the Gauss expedition from 1901 to 1903. Led by Arctic veteran and geology professor Erich von Drygalski, this was the first expedition to use a hot-air balloon in Antarctica. It also found and named Kaiser Wilhelm II Land. The second German Antarctic expedition (1911‚Äì1912) was led by Wilhelm Filchner with a goal of crossing Antarctica to learn if it was one piece of land. As happened with other such early attempts, the crossing failed before it even began. The expedition discovered and named the Luitpold Coast and the Filchner Ice Shelf. A German whaling fleet was put to sea in 1937 and, upon its successful return in early 1938, plans for a third German Antarctic expedition were drawn up. German Antarctic Expedition (1938‚Äì1939) The third German Antarctic Expedition (1938‚Äì1939) was led by Alfred Ritscher (1879‚Äì1963), a captain in the German Navy. The main purpose was to find an area in Antarctica for a German whaling station, as a way to increase Germany's production of fat. Whale oil was then the most important raw material for the production of margarine and soap in Germany and the country was the second largest purchaser of Norwegian whale oil, importing some 200,000 metric tonnes annually. Besides the disadvantage of being dependent on imports, it was thought that Germany would soon be at war, which was considered to put too much strain on Germany's foreign currency reserves. Another goal was to scout possible locations for a German naval base.\\"Hitler's Antarctic base: the myth and the reality\\", by Colin Summerhayes and Peter Beeching, Polar Record, Volume 43 Issue 1, pp.1‚Äì21. Cambridge University Press, 2007. 1938‚Äì1939 expedition logo On 17 December 1938, the New Swabia Expedition left Hamburg for Antarctica aboard MS Schwabenland (a freighter built in 1925 and renamed in 1934 after the Swabia region in southern Germany) which could also carry and catapult aircraft. The secret expedition had 33 members plus Schwabenlands crew of 24. On 19 January 1939 the ship arrived at the Princess Martha Coast, in an area which had lately been claimed by Norway as Queen Maud Land, and began charting the region. Nazi German flags were placed on the sea ice along the coast. Naming the area Neu-Schwabenland after the ship, the expedition established a temporary base and in the following weeks teams walked along the coast recording claim reservations on hills and other significant landmarks. Seven photographic survey flights were made by the ship's two Dornier Wal seaplanes named Passat and Boreas.Boudewijn B√ºch. Eenzaam, Eilanden 2 ('Lonely, Islands 2'), Holland 1994 About a dozen -long aluminum arrows, with steel cones and three upper stabilizer wings embossed with swastikas, were airdropped onto the ice at turning points of the flight polygons (these arrows had been tested on the Pasterze glacier in Austria before the expedition).Ritscher's expedition report, more information pending None of these have ever been recovered. Eight more flights were made to areas of keen interest and on these trips, some of the photos were taken with colour film. Altogether they flew over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers and took more than 16,000 aerial photographs, some of which were published after the war by Ritscher. The ice-free Schirmacher Oasis, which now hosts the Maitri and Novolazarevskaya research stations, was spotted from the air by Richardheinrich Schirmacher (who named it after himself) shortly before the Schwabenland left the Antarctic coast on 6 February 1939. MS Schwabenland in 1938 German map of Antarctica (1941) showing Neuschwabenland (territorial claim) On its return trip to Germany the expedition made oceanographic studies near Bouvet Island and Fernando de Noronha, arriving back in Hamburg on 11 April 1939. Meanwhile, the Norwegian government had learned about the expedition through reports from whalers along the coast of Queen Maud Land. Although some, notably Norwegian writer Bjarne Aagaard and German geographer Ernst Herrmann, have claimed that Germany never actually occupied the territory, it is well documented that Germany issued a decree about the establishment of a German Antarctic Sector called New Swabia after the expedition's return in August 1939. Any German claims to the region were abandoned in 1945. =Geographic features mapped by the expedition= Because the area was first explored by a German expedition, the name Neuschwabenland (New Swabia) is still used for the region on some maps, as are many of the German names given to its geographic features.e.g., National Geographic Atlas of the World, Eighth Edition, 2005 Some geographic features mapped by the expedition were not named until the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) (1949‚Äì1952), led by John Schjelderup Gi√¶ver. Others were not named until they were remapped from aerial photographs taken by the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition (1958‚Äì1959).

According to Article 5, all the people that were resident in India at the commencement of the Constitution were citizens of India as well as people born in India. The President of India is termed the First Citizen of India. The Indian legislation related to this matter is The Citizenship Act, 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Acts of 1986, 1992, 2003, 2005, 2015 and 2019. The 1986 amendment restricted citizenship by birth to require that at least one parent had to be an Indian citizen. The 2003 amendment further restricted that aspect by requiring that a parent could not be an illegal immigrant. The 2003 amendment also mandated the Government of India to construct a National Register of Citizens. The 2019 amendment provided an easier path to citizenship for persecuted selected minorities, i.e Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsi and Christians from the neighbouring Muslim-majority countries of Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 2014. These two measures have given rise to large-scale protests in India in 2019. Article 9 of Indian Constitution says that a person who voluntarily acquires citizenship of any other country is no longer an Indian citizen. Also, according to The Passports Act, a person has to surrender his/her Indian passport and voter card, and other Indian ID cards must not be used after another country's citizenship is obtained. It is a punishable offence if the person fails to surrender the passport. The current Indian nationality law largely follows the jus sanguinis (citizenship by descent) as opposed to the jus soli (citizenship by right of birth within the territory). History = British Raj = The Government of India Act 1858 established the British Raj and formally brought the majority of Indians under British imperial rule. Indians under the British Raj generally fell into two categories: * Indians resident and born in British India came under the direct dominion of and bore allegiance to the British Crown, and held the status of British subject. From 1 January 1915, the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 defined British subjects as those born or naturalised in the British Sovereign's dominions (including British India) along with their spouses and children.legislation.gov.uk: \\"British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914\\" (original as printed) * Indians resident and born in a princely state under the British Raj, or in any other British protectorate or protected state under the British government, held the status of British protected person.For example, see attached regulations for the 1851 Research Fellowship for Indians, with reference to Indians from princely states as British protected persons (Current Science - Science Notes and News) British protected persons were considered de jure foreigners, but could travel on British-issued passports. Effective from 15 August 1947, India was established as the independent Dominion of India. All Indians resident, born in or naturalised in the Indian provinces legally remained British subjects by virtue of Section 18(3) of the Indian Independence Act 1947. Indians residents in the princely states that acceded to India were also regarded as British subjects, while those resident in British protectorates retained the status of British protected persons. : \\"The expression 'British subjects' shall be deemed to include the Ruler and subjects of any of the Acceding States.\\" Indians then residing in the states of the Aden Protectorate or in the states under the Persian Gulf Residency, and their wives and families, remained British protected persons. Both administrations had been previously transferred to the control of the British Foreign Office, the Aden Protectorate in 1917 and the Persian Gulf Residency in April 1947. Members of the Indian diaspora then resident in any other British protectorate or protected state also remained under British protection. = Territorial acquisitions = On 20 December 1961, after military action, India acquired the territories of Goa, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli which were under the territories of Portugal. The French territories of Puducherry, Karaikal, Mah√©, and Yanam, were acquired under treaty of cession with France in 1954 (ratified by the French National Assembly in 1962). Previously, the French territory of Chandernagore had voted in a referendum to join the Indian Union in 1949. Sikkim was also merged with India and became a constituent state with effect from 16 May 1975. Some of the enclaves in the eastern part of India were also acquired under border agreements with Pakistan and Bangladesh. In order to expressly provide the citizenship for people in territories as mentioned above, the central government issued the Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) Order, 1962, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (Citizenship) Order, 1962 and Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order 1962, in exercise of its powers under section 7 of the Citizenship act and for Sikkim, the President extended the Citizenship act, and the relevant rules under Article 371-F(n) of Indian Constitution. In case of acquired enclaves, that did not necessitate legislative action, as that was only a border demarcation agreement.. Granting of citizenship Cover of an Indian passport = Citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution of India = People living in the territory of India as on 26 November 1949 automatically became Indian citizens through operation of the relevant provisions of the Indian Constitution coming into force, and most of these constitutional provisions came into force on 26 January 1950. The Constitution of India also made provision regarding citizenship for migrants from the territories of Pakistan which had been part of India before partition. = Citizenship by birth = Any person born in India on or after 26 January 1950, but prior to the commencement of the 1986 Act on 1 July 1987, is a citizen of India by birth. A person born in India on or after 1 July 1987 but before 3 December 2004 is a citizen of India if one of parents was a citizen of India at the time of the birth. Those born in India on or after 3 December 2004 are considered citizens of India only if both of their parents are citizens of India or if one parent is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of their birth. In September 2013, the Bombay High Court gave a judgement that a birth certificate, passport or even an Aadhaar card alone may not be enough to prove Indian citizenship, unless the parents are Indian citizens. In a 2012 case, the Bombay High Court ruled that a man who was born in Pakistani-administered Kashmir and entered into India was an Indian citizen and should be granted an Indian passport, since India considers all of the Kashmir region to fall within its borders. =Citizenship by Descent= Persons born outside India on or after 26 January 1950 but before 10 December 1992 are citizens of India by descent if their father was a citizen of India at the time of their birth. Persons born outside India on or after 10 December 1992 are considered citizens of India if either of their parents is a citizen of India at the time of their birth. From 3 December 2004 onwards, persons born outside of India shall not be considered citizens of India unless their birth is registered at an Indian diplomatic mission within one year of the date of birth. In certain circumstances it is possible to register after one year with the permission of the Central Government. The application for registration of the birth of a child must be made to an Indian diplomatic mission and must be accompanied by an undertaking in writing from the parents of the child that he or she does not hold the passport of another country. =Citizenship by registration= The Central Government may, on an application, register as a citizen of India under section 5 of the Citizenship Act 1955 any person (not being an illegal migrant) if s/he belongs to any of the following categories: * a person of Indian origin who is ordinarily resident in India for seven years before making application under Section 5(1)(a) (throughout the period of twelve months immediately before making application and for six years in the aggregate in the eight years preceding the 12 months). * a person of Indian origin who is ordinarily resident in any country or place outside undivided India; * a person who is married to a citizen of India and is ordinarily resident in India for seven years before making an application for registration; * minor children of persons who are citizens of India; * a person of full age and capacity whose parents are registered as citizens of India. * a person of full age and capacity who, or either of his parents, was earlier citizen of independent India, and has been residing in India for one year immediately before making an application for registration; * a person of full age and capacity who has been registered as an overseas citizen of India for five years, and who has been residing in India for one year before making an application for registration. =Citizenship by naturalisation= Citizenship of India by naturalisation can be acquired by a foreigner who is ordinarily resident in India for 12 years (throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of application and for 11 years in the aggregate of 14 years preceding the 12 months) and other qualifications as specified in Section 6(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. List of Amendments # Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1986 # Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1992 # Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 # Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005 # Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015 # Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 The 1986 amendment, legislated after the Assam agitation and Assam Accord, restricted citizenship by birth to children born of Indian citizens. At least one parent had to be an Indian citizen for the child to qualify for citizenship. This was a serious restriction of the jus soli principle adopted in the Constitution and the original Citizenship Act. The 2003 amendment further restricted the jus soli principle by requiring that no parent of the child can be an illegal immigrant for the child to qualify for citizenship. It also ruled that illegal immigrants are not eligible for acquiring citizenship by registration or naturalisation. The 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act provides for a path to citizenship for religiously persecuted minorities, namely Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who faced \\"persecution or fear of persecution\\" in their countries and entered India on or before 31 December 2014. The Act was passed by both the houses of Parliament by 11 December 2019. It faced widespread criticism and protests on the grounds that it is discriminatory by omitting Muslims, and for violating the Assam Accord which promised 1971 as the cut-off date for the illegal migrants from Bangladesh.  Renunciation and termination of Indian citizenship  Renunciation is covered in Section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955. If an adult makes a declaration of renunciation of Indian citizenship, s/he loses Indian citizenship. In addition, any minor child of that person also loses Indian citizenship from the date of renunciation. When the child reaches the age of 18, he or she has the right to have his or her Indian citizenship restored. The provisions for making a declaration of renunciation n under Indian citizenship law require that the person making the declaration be \\"of full age and capacity\\". Warning stamped onto Indian Passports Issued by the High Commission of India, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Termination is covered in Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955. The provisions for termination are separate and distinct from the provisions for making a declaration of renunciation. Section 9(1) of the act provides that any citizen of India who by naturalisation or registration acquires the citizenship of another country shall cease to be a citizen of India. Notably, the termination provision differs from the renunciation provision because it applies to \\"any citizen of India\\" and is not restricted to adults. Indian children therefore also automatically lose their claim to Indian citizenship if at any time after birth they acquire a citizenship of another country by, for example, naturalisation or registration ‚Äî even if the acquisition of another citizenship was done as a result of actions by the child's parents. The acquisition of another country's passport is also deemed under the Citizenship Rules, 1956 to be voluntary acquisition of another country's nationality. Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 states that \\"the fact that a citizen of India has obtained on any date a passport from the Government of any other country shall be conclusive proof of his/her having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date\\". Again, this rule applies even if the foreign passport was obtained for the child by his or her parents, and even if possession of such a passport is required by the laws of a foreign country which considers the child to be one of its citizens (e.g., a US-born child of Indian parents who is automatically deemed to be a US citizen according to US law, and who is therefore required by US law to have a US passport in order to enter and leave the US). It does not matter that a person continues to hold an Indian passport. This rule seemingly even applies if the foreign nationality was automatically had from birth, and thus not voluntarily acquired after birth. Persons who acquire another citizenship lose Indian citizenship from the date on which they acquire that citizenship or another country's passport. The prevailing practice at a number of British diplomatic posts, for example, is to impound and return to the Indian authorities the Indian passports of those applicants who apply for and are granted British passports. Special rules exist for Indian citizens with a connection to Goa, Daman and Diu. Rule 3A of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 states that \\"Where a person, who has become an Indian Citizen by virtue of the Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) Order, 1962, or the Dadra and Nagar Haveli (Citizenship) Order 1962, issued under section 7 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955) holds a passport issued by the Government of any other country, the fact that he has not surrendered the said passport on or before the 19 January 1963 shall be conclusive proof of his/her having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date.\\" On 16 February 1962, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India held in the case of Izhar Ahmad Khan vs Union of India that \\"If it is shown that the person has acquired foreign citizenship either by naturalisation or registration, there can be no doubt that s/he ceases to be a citizen of India in consequence of such naturalisation or registration.\\"  Overseas Citizenship of India  Front Cover of an OCI Card. Note: While it resembles a passport, it is not a passport nor does it confer actual Indian citizenship. In response to persistent demands for dual citizenship, particularly from the diaspora in North America and other developed countries, the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending The Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The scheme was launched during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention in Hyderabad in 2006.Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website , Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one ‚Äî even in the case of a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. Therefore, Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of IndiaDual Nationality: India and the United States and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality or anyone no longer to use Indian IDs after OCI. Moreover, the OCI card is not a substitute for an Indian visa and therefore, the passport which displays the lifetime visa must be carried by OCI holders while travelling to India. OCI Cards are now being printed without the lifelong \\"U\\" Visa Sticker (which is normally pasted on the applicant's passport). The proof of lifelong visa will be just the OCI Card which will have \\"Life Time Visa\\" printed on it. The OCI Card will be valid with any Valid Passport. However, countries may consider the OCI as dual citizenship: for example, the UK government considers that, for purposes of the British Nationality Act 1981, \\"OCI is considered to be citizenship of another State\\".  Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) Card  Front cover of a PIO card This was a form of identification issued to an individual who held a passport in a country other than Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and could prove their Indian origin up to three generations before. In early 2011, the then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, announced that the Person of Indian Origin card will be merged with the Overseas Citizen of India card. This new card proposed to be called the Overseas Indian Card.New Overseas Indian Card to replace OCI, PIO As of 9 January 2015, the PIO card scheme has been discontinued and applicants are to apply for OCI only. All PIO Card holders were advised, from time to time, to convert PIO Card to OCI Card.OVERSEAS CITIZENS OF INDIA (OCI), VFS Global, retrieved 8 November 2019. Dual Citizenship It is generally difficult to have dual citizenship of India and another country, due to the provisions for loss of Indian nationality when an Indian national naturalizes in another country (see \\"Loss of citizenship\\" above), and the requirement to renounce one's existing citizenships when naturalizing in India (see \\"Naturalization\\" above). There are still some ways in which a person may have dual citizenship of India and another country, including: * Children of foreign diplomats, who are born in India, are also given dual citizenship during the period of their parents' service in India. * A minor child of Indian origins may hold dual citizenship of India and another country, though acquiring a passport from the other country of citizenship would normally terminate the Indian citizenship. * A minor, who is an Indian citizen by descent but also possess another nationality by birth, involuntarily, may retain the same and hence will be a dual citizen until attaining the full age of 18 years. Within 6 months of attaining full age, the child needs to decide on nationality and renounce the foreign citizenship otherwise, the Indian nationality will default be terminated. A public interest litigation (PIL) seeking dual citizenship for overseas Indians was filed in the Supreme Court on 6 January 2015 on the eve of the inauguration of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) in Gujarat's capital Gandhinagar by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On 20 April 2015, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL). In dismissing the said PIL, the Supreme Court reasoned that Mr. Venkat Narayan cannot plead on somebody else's behalf as he is not the aggrieved party and those who need to assert their right should come forward. Visa requirements Visa requirements for Indian citizens Visa requirements for Indian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of India. As of 13 February 2018, Indian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 56 countries and territories, ranking the Indian passport 81st in terms of travel freedom (tied with Ivory Coast, Senegal and Togo passports), according to the Henley visa restrictions index.

Air Force Interceptor Command Experimental Station No. 6 is a long-range radar installation located in Winthrop, Manitoba, Canada. Unexplained deaths begin to occur in the general area of a farming village near the American base. Postmortems reveal the victims were murdered and the brains and spinal cords are missing from the corpses; the only clue left behind are two puncture marks at the base of each skull. The locals, however, become convinced that radiation leaks from the radar installation's nuclear-power experiments are the cause of the mysterious deaths. Air Force Major Jeff Cummings (Thompson) begins an investigation as the local deaths continue, interviewing various townsfolk, while looking for anything unusual. Cummings becomes suspicious of Professor R. E. Walgate (Reeves), a retired British scientist living near the airbase; Walgate is in the process of writing another book about his ongoing experiments with telekinesis, this time as it applies to thought projection. Major Cummings' suspicion of Walgate is later proved to be correct. The scientist finally admits he has not only succeeded in developing his mental ability, but in the process created a living thought projection. Unknown to Professor Walgate, the nuclear power radar experiments underway at the nearby U. S. airbase have greatly enhanced his mental abilities to the point that, through him, his living thought projection has become a malevolent and invisible new life form. It escaped from Walgate's laboratory and is now attacking humans as a means of replicating physical, though still invisible, new versions of itself, all of which are now feeding on the base's nuclear-generated power. The invisible creatures eventually attack and kill the military personnel at the airbase in order to take over control of the radar station's nuclear reactor; two of them dial-up the power to very dangerous levels. As they do so all the creatures suddenly become visible. Their now visible bodies are revealed to be the missing brains with spinal cords stolen from their victims; their spinal cords have become very flexible and have now sprouted tendrils. These mutations also allow the brain-spine creatures to move quickly and even leap distances; each brain-spine has also developed a pair of small eyes at the ends of extended eye stalks. The slithering creations then attack Walgate's home, where most of the film's principal characters have gathered to discuss the crisis. Some of the brains get inside by breaking through a boarded-up window using their tendrils, while others leap to the roof and slither down through the fireplace's open flue. Some of the defenders are attacked and killed, but well-aimed .45 semi-automatic pistol shots to the brains soon make short work of most of the attacking creatures; they gorily bleed out as they expire. Professor Walgate exits his home as a diversion, but is quickly attacked and killed by his creation. Meanwhile, Major Cummings escapes out the back way and quickly heads to the airbase, where he saves the day by blowing up the radar installation's power machinery. This immediately robs the surviving brains of their high-energy food source, and the creatures quickly die, dissolving into puddles of goo.

Its Canadian setting was chosen because it would appeal to both American and British Commonwealth movie audiences, while still being easy to replicate using the English shooting locations. U. S. Air Force stock aviation footage was also used to establish the military base setting and to pad out the film's meager running time. The producers used primarily expatriate American and Canadian actors working in the United Kingdom, plus a few British actors dubbed by Americans. The film's visible brain creatures were created using stop-motion animation, an unusual practice for such a low-budget science fiction thriller of this era. The director of these effects sequences was Florenz Von Nordoff, while the actual stop-motion was done in Munich by Nordhoff's partner, German special effects artist K. L. Ruppel. Peter Neilson headed up the British practical effects crew. During July 1958, Fiend Without a Face first opened in the United States at the Rialto Theatre in New York City's Theater District. The film's producers placed an outdoor, front-of-the-house exhibit near the sidewalk that showcased a \\"living and breathing Fiend\\" in a steel-barred glass display case. It periodically moved its spinal cord tail, startling onlookers, and also made menacing sounds with the help of a concealed electrical device. The crowds that gathered to watch the caged Fiend grew so large that NYC police finally ordered the display case removed because it was creating a public disturbance. Five months later, Fiend Without a Face created a public uproar after its British premiere at the Ritz Theatre in Leicester Square in London's West End. The British Board of Film Censors had demanded a number of cuts before its release and finally granted the film an \\"X\\" certificate, but newspaper critics were still aghast at its horrifying special effects. Questions were actually raised in Parliament as to why British censors had allowed Fiend Without a Face to be released, notably: \\"What is the British film industry thinking by trying to beat Hollywood at its own game of overdosing on blood and gore\\". Reception With a 67% \\"Fresh\\" rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Fiend Without a Face is considered one of the best B movies of the 1950s. James Rolfe called the film the \\"best killer brain movie ever\\" and stated that \\"it may be the goriest film of its time\\".Rolfe, James. \\"Fiend Without A Face (1958).\\" Cinemassacre, 6 October 2010.

It is the second largest and most populated city of West Bengal and the 39th largest urban agglomeration in India. Asansol is the district headquarters of Paschim Bardhaman district. According to a 2010 report released by the International Institute for Environment and Development, a UK-based policy research non- governmental body, Asansol was ranked 11th among Indian cities and 42nd in the world in its list of 100 fastest-growing cities. Asansol is classed as a Y-category city for calculation of HRA (House Rent Allowance) for public servants, making it a Tier-II city. Etymology \\"Asan\\", a species of tree which generally grows thirty meters tall, is found on the banks of the Damodar River; \\"sol\\" refers to land. The name \\"Asansol\\" is a combination of these two words. Asansol is a city on the banks of Damodar and its land is rich in minerals. Historically the city was anglicized as Assensole during the British era but the name was reverted after Independence.http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10689/21975/16/November_Chapter%203_2362-2432p.pdfhttp://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10973/47105/GIPE-070160.pdf History The region is believed to have been a part of the kingdom of Vishnupur where the Malla dynasty ruled for approximately a thousand years till the emergence of the British. This theory is backed by the presence of Vishnupur style temple present at Chhotodighari village and Domohani village in Asansol.http://www.asansolmunicipalcorporation.org/amrut/amrut%20news.pdf Geography =Overview= Asansol is a cosmopolitan city located on the lower Chota Nagpur Plateau, which occupies most of Jharkhand, between the Damodar and Ajay rivers. Another river, the Barakar, joins the Damodar near Dishergarh. Two small rivulets, Nunia and Garui flows past Asansol. Map of Paschim Bardhaman district While Dhanbad district in Jharkhand lies on the western side, Durgapur subdivision lies on the eastern side. To the south, across the Damodar river are the Purulia and Bankura districts. To the north are Dumka and Birbhum districts. Dhanbad district is a major coal mining area and has close links with Asansol; both lie in the Damodar valley. The city is connected by the Grand Trunk Road and by rail with Durgapur, Burdwan, and Kolkata. It is an important coal-trading and railway centre, with large railway workshops and a railway colony. =Police stations= Asansol North police station has jurisdiction over Raniganj CD Block and parts of Asansol Municipal Corporation. The area covered is 49 km2 and the population covered is 410,000 (2001). Asansol South police station has jurisdiction over parts of Asansol municipal corporation. The area covered is 69 km2 and the population covered is 475,439 (2001). Asansol Women PS covers both Asansol and Durgapur subdivisions. Raniganj, Jamuria, Hirapur and Kulti police stations also serve parts of Asansol municipal corporation area. According to the Kolkata Gazette notification of 3 June 2015, the municipal areas of Kulti, Raniganj and Jamuria were included within the jurisdiction of Asansol Municipal Corporation. Administration Asansol is administered by the Asansol Municipal Corporation. In 1850, a union committee was formed to look after the civic needs of Asansol. The Assensole (now Asansol) Municipality was approved in 1885 but started functioning effectively in 1896. It was upgraded to the status of a corporation in 1994. Since 2011 it has had its own Police Commissionerate. In 2015, Kulti, Jamuria and Raniganj Municipalities were dissolved and now these areas are administered by the Asansol Municipal Corporation. Thus the proper city limits of Asansol includes the old Asansol Area, including Burnpur, as well as other prominent locations like Raniganj, Chinakuri, Mithani, Barakar, Kulti, Dishergarh, Neamatpur, Sitarampur and Jamuria. Asansol Municipal Corporation has 106 wards. Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority (ADDA) was established in April 1980 by the merger of the Asansol Planning Organisation and the Durgapur Development Authority. Jurisdiction of ADDA covers the areas administered by Asansol Municipal Corporation, the Jamuria Panchayet Samiti, the Community Development Blocks of Andal, Pandabeswar and Durgapur-Faridpur, Durgapur Municipal Corporation and a small part of Kanksa Community Development Block. Climate Asansol has hot and dry summers and cold chilly winters. In summers temperatures soar above 45 ¬∞C with dry hot air blowing known as 'loo' while in winter temperatures go below 10 ¬∞C. Monsoon lasts from June to September. The K√∂ppen Climate Classification sub-type for this climate is \\"Aw\\" (Tropical Savanna Climate). Demographics As per the 2011 census, the total population of Asansol is 1,243,414 out of which 646,052 are males and 597,362 are females. The city has a literacy rate of 83.30%. *For language details see Salanpur (community development block)#Language and religion Transport =Road= The Grand Trunk Road (NH 19 - old numbering NH 2) runs across the subdivision and NH 14 (old numbering NH 60) connects Asansol with Odisha. NH 19 has been broadened as part of the Golden Quadrilateral project and now allows three-lane traffic in both directions. A highway bypass avoids the areas of Ushagram, Murgasol, Asansol Bazar, Chelidanga, BNR, Gopalpur, Neamatpur, Kulti, and Barakar. Some of the other important roads of the city are namely Vivekananda Avenue, Burnpur Road, and S.B Gorai Road. The South Bengal State Transport Corporation operates daily bus services to Kolkata and numerous other destinations, such as Malda, Siliguri, Midnapur, Bankura, Siuri, Purulia, Burdwan, Kalna, Howrah, Barackpore, Digha, Bolpur, Kirnahar and Berhampore. The North Bengal State Transport Corporation also runs services to and from the city and towns in North Bengal like Malda, Raiganj and Balurghat. There are also many private buses, Taxis and Radio Taxis, which ply locally and on intercity and interstate routes. =Railway= Asansol Junction railway station building Asansol Junction railway station is the Division of Eastern Railway zone This is one of the oldest divisions on the Indian Railways and has always been in the forefront of operations, both freight and passenger. As far as Eastern Railway is concerned, Asansol Division is referred to as the heart of operations, being at the crossroads of the Grand Chord route via Gaya and the main line route via Patna. With a total of 629.38 route kilometers, the division has the unique distinction of having quadruple lines (two up and two down line) from Khana to Sitarampur. The railway track from Kolkata to Delhi passes through the subdivision and bifurcates into the main line and the grand chord line at Sitarampur railway junction, a little to the west of Asansol railway junction. Another railway track links Asansol with Adra and then to Jamshedpur via Purulia and Kharagpur via Bankura. A branch line connects Andal with Sainthia on the Sahibganj Loop. Almost all the trains linking Kolkata with north India also connect with Asansol including Sealdah Rajdhani, Howrah Rajdhani, Howrah Duronto, Sealdah Humsafar Express, Yuva Express and Shalimar Duronto. As a result, Asansol enjoys good connectivity with cities like New Delhi, Jammu, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Allahabad, Kanpur, Lucknow, Dehradun, Jaipur, Kota, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Gwalior, Bhopal, Indore, Patna, Ranchi and Dhanbad on the one hand and commands a fairly good traffic movement towards the western cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Surat and southern cities like Bhubaneshwar, Visakhapatnam, Vijaywada, Chennai, Bangalore and Trivandrum. It is also connected with Guwahati in the north-east region. =Air= The domestic airport that serves the city is Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport. The airport is located in Andal. It is roughly from the Asansol City Bus Terminus. There is also a private airport located at Burnpur Riverside Area. At present this Airport is operated by IISCO. Recently Airport Authority of India gave nod to start commercial flights for six routes in West Bengal; Burnpur Airport being one of them is hopeful to receive its first commercial flight by the last quarter of 2019.http://cadup.gov.in/writereaddata/pdf/RCS_Round_1_and_2.pdf The nearest international airport is Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Dum Dum in Kolkata. Economy The economy of Asansol is primarily dependent on its steel and coal industries, railways, and its trade and commerce. =Steel= IISCO panoramic view, Asansol Modernised ISP The Steel Authority of India IISCO (Indian Iron and Steel Company Ltd) steel-making plant at Kulti was the first such facility in India. It became well known during the 1960s and 1970s, with its company shares being traded on the London Stock Exchange. However, a decade later the company became loss-making until it was revived in 2006 when it merged with the Steel Authority of India. Modernisation at IISCO Steel Plant has helped the city develop at a very rapid pace. The plant's capacity will be raised from 0.4 MT to 2.5 MT of saleable steel, using what will be the biggest blast furnace in the country. As of 2015, the investment for modernization was the single largest investment in West Bengal till then. =Coal= Eastern Coalfields, which has its headquarters in Sanctoria P.O. - Dishergarh, has a significant presence in the area due to the huge deposits of high-quality coal. However, most of the coalfields and surrounding residential colonies are located away from the main city. Nearby areas like Raniganj, Chinakuri, and Jamuria are of particular importance as coal blocks. As of 2012, the total coal reserve in the ECL command area up to 600 metre depth was 49.17 billion tonnes. =Railways= Railways also is a big contributor to the economy of Asansol. Railways were the first employer in the city and they are credited with developing the city in the late 19th century. Asansol is one of four divisions of Eastern Railway Zone and among the major revenue generating divisions in Indian Railways. World's largest vertically integrated organisation Chittaranjan Locomotive Works under Indian Railways is also situated here. It is India's first locomotive works and Asia's largest Locomotive manufacturer. =Other business ventures= Other industries include Dishergarh Power Supply, Damodar Valley Corporation, Burn Standard Co. which is now a subsidiary of Eastern Railways, Hindustan Cables Limited and cement factories like Burnpur Cement.

Air rage generally covers both behavior of a passenger that is likely caused by physiological or psychological stresses associated with air travel, and when a passenger becomes unruly, angry, or violent on an aircraft during a flight. Excessive consumption of alcohol by the passengers is often a cause. Landing to disembark the troublemaker cannot usually be done quickly and causes great delays to other passengers. However, unlike large ships, there is insufficient room on board to hold the offender in an isolated area until arrival. Therefore, diversions or unscheduled stops do occur because of air rage. Examples of behavior that threatens flight safety include failure to follow safety regulations or behaving in a way that gives suspicion of a threat to flight safety. An airline passenger's uncontrolled anger is usually expressed in aggressive or violent behavior in the passenger compartment, but air rage can have serious implications, especially if the offender decides to interfere with the aircraft's navigation or flight controls. Generally, such passengers are not at risk of committing terrorist acts, but since the September 11 attacks, such incidents have been taken more seriously due to increased awareness of terrorism. History The first case of air rage was recorded in 1947 on a flight from Havana to Miami, when a drunk man assaulted another passenger and a flight attendant. Another early documented case involved a flight in Alaska in 1950. At the time, applicable jurisdiction was unclear, so offenders often escaped punishment. It wasn't until the 1963 Tokyo Convention that laws of the country where the aircraft is registered were agreed to take precedence. Air rage events have increased markedly since the September 11 attacks. No definite explanation for that trend has been established; possible explanations include heightened anxiety for one's safety and irritation with invasive security.  Causes  The most common cause of a passenger or crew member acting unruly is from drunkenness. The availability of alcoholic beverages on airlines and at airports enables passengers to drink excessively before and during flights. Flight attendants have the ability to keep track of how many drinks are served to passengers while on board an aircraft, and are required by many countries to refuse further drinks to passengers who appear intoxicated, but have no way of knowing how many are consumed prior to boarding. According to one study by the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU), half of all air rage incidents on Western airlines involve alcohol. Other causes include the use of drugs (prescription or illegal), sometimes in conjunction with alcohol consumption. Sometimes, sober passengers are disruptive by failing to obey laws and rules that must be observed or arguing with flight attendants. Stressful situations, such as jet lag, flight delays, or other difficult or annoying passengers or crew members in one's vicinity, can lead passengers and crew members to an increased likelihood of becoming agitated and air rage. Passengers who are afraid on board of a plane already experience stress from the fact they are boarding a plane and can easily panic. The HKPU study found that on Asian airlines, where air rage incidents are rarer due to a less entrenched drinking culture and greater tolerance for the inconvenience and space shortages involved in air travel, the air rage incidents that do occur arise from inexperience and lack of knowledge about the restrictions involved. In China, where the study's authors described some incidents of air rage as \\"legendary\\" due to pictures or video posted on social media, some passengers have been known to do things like open cabin doors while the plane was taxiing to let hot air out, or throw coins in the engines for good luck. Air rages can also be the result of a combination of factors, for example a person who is already afraid of flying can be tipped over the edge by an overuse of alcohol, medication stressful situation or disruptive behavior from others. Traits Air rage generally covers both behavior of a passenger or passengers on the aircraft or more generally speaking at the airport: * Undue anger. * Gratuitous violence. * Unruliness. * Obnoxiousness * Threatening flight safety. * Failure to follow safety regulations. * Behaving in a way that gives suspicion of a threat to flight safety. * Claiming to have a bomb on the flight or falsely saying they are a terrorist with malignant intent. * Temper tantrums. * Disruptive behaviour.http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861668862/air_rage.html * Threatening crew members and other passengers. Other related behavior that may interfere with the comfort of cabin crew or passengers include smoking on board the flight, viewing pornographic materials, performing sex acts (\\"mile high\\" club) in the aircraft cabin, making undue sexual advances towards other people, performing sex acts in the lavatory, the inappropriate groping and touching of crew members, loud or drunken behaviors, spitting, swearing, and wearing clothing that is inappropriate or offensive.  Handling air rage  Extremely unruly passengers or crew members who must be restrained are restrained using a variety of methods. Some airlines carry flexcuffs for this purpose. Others use seatbelts, adhesive tape, neckties, shoe laces, or whatever is available on the aircraft. While the United States does not allow passengers to actually be confined to the seat or any other part of the aircraft, and only allows their individual body parts to be restrained, other countries, such as Iceland, do allow tying an unruly passenger to the seat. Sometimes a flight must be diverted to allow an aircraft to dispose itself of the offender as soon as possible.  Consequences  In the United States, passengers who disrupt the duties of a flight crew member can face fines up to $25,000 and sometimes lengthy prison sentences. In addition, the airline can choose to ban the problem passenger from any future flights. In Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority reserves the right to use stun guns to subdue unruly passengers. In Canada the Pilot-in-Command (Captain) of the aircraft is designated as a Peace Officer under the Criminal Code and as such, have the same powers of arrest as a Police Officer. The Pilot-in-Command is authorized to enforce all sections of the Criminal Code and all Acts of Parliament while the aircraft is in flight.

In 2007, Flournoy co-founded the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that specializes in U.S. national security issues. After leaving the Obama White House, Flournoy joined the Boston Consulting Group as a senior advisor. In 2018, she joined the board of Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm with military contracts and cyber security expertise. She is currently the co- founder and managing partner of West Exec Advisors, and a Senior Fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Early life and education Flournoy's father George Flournoy was a cinematographer who worked on shows including I Love Lucy and The Odd Couple. He died of a heart attack when Mich√®le was 14 years old.http://fortune.com/2014/11/24/michele- flournoy/ Flournoy attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California. She studied at Harvard College where she received a bachelor of arts degree. She received an M.Litt. in international relations in 1983 from Oxford University, where she was a Newton-Tatum scholar at Balliol College. From 1989 until 1993 she was at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she was a Research Fellow in its International Security Program. Career =Clinton administration= Flournoy served as a political appointee under the Clinton administration in the U.S. Department of Defense, where she was dual-hatted as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Threat Reduction and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy. In that capacity, she was responsible for three policy offices in the Office of the Secretary of Defense: * Strategy * Requirements, Plans, and Counterproliferation * Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasian Affairs Flournoy was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1996, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1998 and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff‚Äôs Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 2000. While serving under the Clinton Administration as a deputy assistant secretary of defense, Flournoy assisted in drafting the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, which in a post Cold War era \\"determined U.S. forces must be capable of fighting and winning two major theater wars nearly simultaneously.\\" =Public policy research= She then joined the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University (NDU) as a research professor, founding and leading NDU's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) working group, which had been chartered by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop intellectual capital in preparation for the Defense Department‚Äôs upcoming QDR in 2001. She then moved to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where she was a Senior Advisor working on a range of defense policy and international security issues before co-founding the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), to which she was named President, in 2007 with Kurt M. Campbell. Flournoy and CNAS co-founder Kurt Campbell wrote a 2007 policy paper called \\"The Inheritance and the Way Forward\\" that advocated for a U.S. foreign policy \\"grounded in a common-sense pragmatism rather than ideology\\". Specifically, the paper recommended U.S. phased withdrawal from Iraq but rejection of isolationist impulses. In 2020, Flournoy was in line to become Joe Biden's Secretary of Defense, should the presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee defeat Donald Trump. At that time, Flournoy turned her attention to China in \\"How to Prevent a War in Asia; The Erosion of American Deterrence Raises the Risk of Chinese Miscalculation.\\" In this essay, Flournoy argued the US must invest in new military technologies, such as prototypes for artificial intelligence, as well as more long range missiles, escalate U.S. troop deployment to the South China Sea area, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, and step up roving war games in Asia to show China the US has the modern technology, might and will to deter Chinese aggression. Without such ramped up U.S. military activity in the waters off China and absent the technology to ward off a Chinese cyber attack on U.S. navigation systems, Flournoy asserted the U.S. could stumble into a nuclear confrontation with China over Taiwan sovereignty. = Obama administration = After the 2008 presidential election, she was selected as one of the Review Team Leads for the Obama transition at the Department of Defense. On January 8, 2009, President-elect Obama announced that he was nominating her as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, to serve under Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. In his memoirs, Secretary Gates wrote that he had \\"developed high respect for\\" Flournoy, whom he characterized as \\"clear-thinking and strong\\".Robert Gates, Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War. Alfred A. Knopf; (January 14, 2014). , Kindle edition location 5150 In 2009, Flournoy told the New York Times she had spent much of her adult life steeped in the practice of war. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to recognize that warfare may come in a lot of different flavors in the future,‚Äù she told the newspaper.  Libya  In 2011, in the midst of the Arab Spring and popular street uprisings, Flournoy, then Undersecretary of Defense, helped persuade President Obama to intervene militarily in Libya, despite opposition from members of Congress and key White House advisors, such as Joe Biden, Vice President; Tom Donilon, National Security Advisor; and Robert Gates, Defense Secretary.. Flournoy supported the NATO-led imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to oust resistant leader Muammar Gaddafi, accused of ordering the killing of demonstrators and promising to \\"hunt the rebels down and show no mercy.\\" Flournoy said imposition of a no-fly zone necessitated first destroying Libya's air defenses with U.S. and British cruise missiles targeting the Libyan missile defense system, and U.S. B-2 bombers attacking Libyan airfields. In a 2013 conversation with the Council on Foreign Relations, Flournoy said she had supported US military intervention on humanitarian grounds. Critics who disagreed with Flournoy described the war on Libya as \\"disastrous\\" in its destabilization of entire regions in the Middle East and North Africa, facilitating the transfer of arms to extremists across countries. Two years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi, Flournoy defended the U.S. military intervention in Libya, telling the Council on Foreign Relations: ‚ÄúI think we were right to do it.‚Äù  Resignation  On December 12, 2011, Flournoy announced that she would step down in February 2012 to return to private life and contribute to President Barack Obama's re-election bid. As part of the Obama campaign, Flournoy appeared in a message from the official Democrat Twitter feed on October 22, 2012. She was shown in a video responding to GOP candidate Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the US's \\"number-one geopolitical foe\\" by stating Romney's was \\"a really curious statement, given that the Cold War has been over for some time.\\"Romney, who calls Russia our \\"No. 1 geopolitical foe,\\" doesn't seem to realize it's the 21st century. #RomneyNotReady =Affiliations= Flournoy speaking on the panel, \\"Is the Pentagon Adapting Fast Enough?\\" at the New America Foundation first annual Future of War conference, Washington, D.C., February 25, 2015; also pictured, left to right: Kevin Baron, Flournoy, Janine Davidson, Thomas Ricks In 2017, Flournoy, along with Antony Blinken, US Deputy Secretary of State in the Obama administration, co-founded WestExec Advisors, a strategic advisory firm for international companies and financial institutions addressing geopolitical factors that affect their business strategy and investment portfolios. She previously served as a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group's Washington D.C.-based public sector practice. In July 2020, American Prospect journalist Jonathan Guyer reported in \\"How Biden's Foreign Policy Team Got Rich,\\" that under Flournoy's direction the Boston Consulting Group's military contracts went \\"from $1.6 million in 2013 to $32 million in 2016.\\" Flournoy is a Senior Fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

Although Thomas is recorded in Robert Douglas's Peerage of Scotland as \\"born and died, October 21, 1821\\", rumours began to circulate during the late 19th century that the child had been born deformed, and had therefore been brought up in seclusion hidden away in Glamis Castle in Angus, Scotland, giving rise to the soubriquet of the Monster of Glamis, or the Horror of Glamis. Mystery of Glamis Rumours of Thomas Lyon-Bowes' survival, as recounted by James Wentworth Day in his 1967 book The Queen Mother's Family Story, appear to have started in local villages as the result of an account by the midwife, whose name is unrecorded. The deformed child was alleged to have been in good health when the midwife left, causing suspicion when his death was announced a day or two later. The story was discussed during the latter half of the 19th century, when \\"Miss M. Gilchrist, writing in 1885, was not only confident that such a monster did actually exist, but even described him ‚Äì half frog, half man!\\", also claiming he was the rightful earl. Details published about the mystery of Glamis during the reign of Queen Victoria scarcely mention a monster and are instead focused on the possibility of members of a rival clan dying while locked in the secret room. The earliest surviving reference dates from 1908, in which it was claimed that \\"in the Castle of Glamis is a secret chamber. In this chamber is confined a monster, who is the rightful heir to the title and property, but who is so unpresentable that it is necessary to keep him out of sight and out of possession\\". The child Thomas has no gravestone, a matter which tends to support the initial rumours. (Thomas had been baptised as a Christian on birth.) This part of the story of Thomas did not become current until the 1960s, when reputed family accounts were first published. However, the fact that Thomas Lyon-Bowes, as a child who died in infancy, has no individual gravestone is in keeping with the funeral customs of the time, when ‚Äì owing to high rates of infant mortality ‚Äì usually only adults were commemorated in this way. While dedicated funerary monuments for children do exist, they are comparatively rare. During a visit to Glamis the Queen Mother's biographer Michael Thornton was allegedly told by the sixteenth Earl that the entrance to the chamber where Thomas lived had been bricked up after his death. Some accounts also came from singer and composer Virginia Gabriel, who stayed at the castle in 1870. According to Raymond Lamont Brown, a folklorist writing an account of tales associated with Glamis, while stories of a concealed chamber are likely to have a factual basis, he asserts the family emphatically refute rumours about a monster.

These behaviors include rude and verbal insults, physical threats or dangerous driving methods targeted toward another driver or non-drivers such as pedestrians or cyclists in an effort to intimidate or release frustration. Road rage can lead to altercations, damage to property, assaults and collisions that result in serious physical injuries or even death. Strategies include long horn honks, swerving, tailgating, brake checking, and attempting to fight. According to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety that examined police records nationally, there are more than 1,200 incidents of road rage on average reported per year in the United States. Many of these incidents have ended with serious injuries or even fatalities. These rates rose yearly throughout the six years of the study. A number of studies have found that individuals with road rage are predominantly young (33 years old on average) and 96.6% male. Legal status A traffic jam in Poland In some jurisdictions, there can be a legal difference between \\"road rage\\" and \\"aggressive driving\\". In the U.S., only a few states have enacted special aggressive driving laws, where road rage cases are normally prosecuted as assault and battery (with or without a vehicle), or \\"vehicular homicide\\". The legal definition of road rage encompasses a group of behaviors expressed while driving, or stemming from traffic-related incidents. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration defines road rage as when \\"The operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.\\" This definition makes the distinction that aggressive driving is a traffic violation and road rage is a criminal offense. Effects on drivers learner driver practicing reversing. The AA has reported that learner drivers and driving instructors are becoming targets of road rage at an increasing rate. A stressed driver's behavior depends on that driver's coping abilities. Generally, drivers who scored high on aggression tests used direct confrontation strategies when faced with stress while driving. Many drivers who experience road rage have admitted that they believe they commit more traffic violations. Driving presents many stresses any time a person is behind the wheel because of high speeds and other drivers making different decisions. As stress increases, the likelihood of a person having road rage increases dramatically. Typically, younger males are most susceptible to road rage. Most reported cases of road rage occur because of cutting in and out of traffic, lane changes, disputes over parking spots or rude gestures. According to the same report, 6.8% of road rage incidents result in death. According to one study, people who customize their cars with stickers and other adornments are more prone to road rage. The number of territory markers predicted road rage better than vehicle value or condition. Only the number of bumper stickers, not their content, predicted road rage. Common targets of road rage are driving instructors and learner drivers; as these road users tend to follow road regulations very closely, with learners prone to making more mistakes as they progress through their education towards taking a driving test, they are often antagonised by aggressive drivers. In 2019, British insurance provider Young Marmalade carried out a survey which found that 77% of driving instructors face regular abuse and intimidation from other road users while teaching students, and that 8% of learner drivers have abandoned learning to drive as a result of road rage they have been subjected to. An electric road sign in Massachusetts encouraging drivers not to have any road rage. Road rage is not an official mental disorder recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). However, according to an article published by the Associated Press in June 2006, the behaviors typically associated with road rage can be the result of a disorder known as intermittent explosive disorder that is recognized in the DSM. This conclusion was drawn from surveys of some 9,200 adults in the United States between 2001 and 2003. The surveys were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Penalties Road rage is a relatively serious act: It may be seen as an endangerment of public safety. It is, however, not always possible to judge intent by external observation, so \\"road ragers\\" who are stopped by police may be charged with other offences such as careless or reckless driving, or may be fined. Road ragers may be considered as criminals. = Australia = In New South Wales, Australia, road rage is considered an extremely serious act. Any person who chases another motorist or shows intimidating and/or bullying towards another road user can be charged with predatory driving, a serious offence that can send the culprit to jail for up to five years. Offenders can also be fined A$100,000 and disqualified from driving, whether or not he or she intended to harm the victim physically. If the predatory driving results in a physical assault or harm, and/or the victim's car was intentionally damaged, penalties can be much more severe. Additionally, most common-law countries prohibit common assault, which could apply to road rage where the personal safety of the victim is seen to be threatened. The common law regards assault as both a criminal and civil matter, leading to both public criminal penalties and private civil liabilities. = Germany = Road rage, insults and rude gestures in traffic can lead to fines and even prison sentences to drivers who shout insults or make offensive gestures while driving.Road rage, insults, rude gestures can lead to fines, prison in Germany, Robert Szostek U.S. Army Europe Office of the Provost Marshal Public Affairs Office, November 24, 2009 = New Zealand = In New Zealand, road rage in itself is not an offence, but drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually assault or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user. = Singapore = Road rage is a crime in Singapore. When found guilty, the offender may be jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for causing damage. = United Kingdom = In the UK, road rage can result in criminal penalties for assault or more serious offences against the person. The Public Order Act 1986 can also apply to road rage. Sections 4A and 5 of the 1986 Act prohibit public acts likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress. Section 4 also prohibits threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior with intent to cause a victim to believe that violence will be used against himself or another. =United States= In some jurisdictions, such as the Commonwealth of Virginia, it is easier to prosecute road rage as reckless driving instead of aggressive driving simply because the burden of proof does not require \\"intent\\" to successfully convict. It is likely that those causing serious injury or death during \\"road rage\\" incidents will suffer more serious penalties than those applicable to similar outcomes from simple negligence. In April 2007, a Colorado driver was convicted of first-degree murder for causing the deaths of two motorists in November 2005.Road-rage driver offers blame at sentencing: Local News: The Rocky Mountain News He will serve a mandatory sentence of two consecutive life terms. Fourteen U.S. states have passed laws against aggressive driving. Only one state, California, has turned \\"road rage\\" into a legal term of art by giving it a particular meaning. In Virginia, aggressive driving is punished as a lesser crime (Class 2 misdemeanor) than reckless driving (Class 1 misdemeanor). U.S. rankings A 2007 study of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas concluded that the cities with the least courteous drivers (most road rage) are Miami, Phoenix, New York, Los Angeles, and Boston. The cities with the most courteous drivers (least road rage) are Minneapolis, Nashville, St. Louis, Seattle, and Atlanta. In 2009, New York, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis/St. Paul were rated the top five \\"Road Rage Capitals\\" of the United States.

Plot summary With Lestat still in slumber, the vampire coven is reunited around the \\"brat prince\\" and the vampire David Talbot asks Armand tell his life story. Born somewhere in the Kievan Rus in the late 15th century, Armand (at this time called Andrei) becomes an icon painter in a monastery. He is forcefully taken out of this life of prayer and devotion by slave traders, who transport him to Constantinople and then to a brothel in Venice. Soon after his arrival, he is purchased by the vampire Marius de Romanus, who names him Amadeo. Marius lives the extravagant life of a respected Renaissance painter, and mentors many boys who serve as his apprentices. Marius provides them with education, shelter, and food, and he assists them in finding respectable positions once they are grown. Over time, Amadeo's relationship with Marius develops and they become much closer than Marius is with any of the other boys. In addition to developing a sexual relationship, Amadeo sleeps in Marius' bed, is privy to special privileges, and becomes something of a \\"head boy\\" in the household. Still, Marius maintains strict control over Amadeo, and expects industriousness from him in all things. When Amadeo comes of age, Marius begins Amadeo's education in sexuality and coupling. He takes Amadeo to a brothel, where he remains for several days. Amadeo later visits a male brothel, and makes several observations about the difference in sexual activities with the different genders. There is a distinct bisexuality to Amadeo's nature, as he enjoys activity with either sex. He later has a brief affair with an Englishman called Lord Harlech, who develops an unrequited obsession with Amadeo. During this period, Amadeo befriends and ultimately seduces Bianca Solderini, a wealthy debutante and courtesan whose primary role in life seems to be to throw nightly parties. Marius eventually divulges his vampire nature to Amadeo, who almost immediately begins asking to be turned. Marius shows Amadeo some of what it means to be immortal, and allows him to join him in the hunt on several occasions. He tells Amadeo that they must always focus on killing evildoers; they assist Bianca by murdering her kinsmen who have been forcing her to poison those from whom they have borrowed money. Eventually, on a night when Marius is out of the country, Harlech breaks into Marius's palazzo and attacks Amadeo, murdering two apprentices in the process. Amadeo kills Harlech, but not before the Englishman wounds him with a poisoned sword. Amadeo falls critically ill, and over several days falls into fever and delusions. Upon returning and finding Amadeo on his deathbed, Marius heals Amadeo's external wounds, cleans and grooms him, then gives him the Dark Gift, turning him into a vampire. Marius sets out to train Amadeo, retaining high expectations of him, and forces him to continue his education in the arts. Amadeo's transition to vampire is relatively easy for him, although the Dark Gift brings about nightmares of his childhood. Marius and Amadeo return to Ukraine, where Amadeo visits his old school and home. He finds his elderly parents, reveals that he is alive, and leaves them with all the money and jewels he has with him. Shortly after returning to Venice, the vampire Santino and his coven attack Marius' home, kidnap Amadeo and the apprentices, and burn the villa. Marius is burned and thought to be destroyed; his boys are taken to a bonfire and thrown in one by one by the coven as Amadeo watches. Santino spares Amadeo and educates him in the laws of the coven. Amadeo later goes to Paris, changes his name to Armand, and creates his own coven under the Cimeti√®re des Innocents, which Lestat would years later drastically impact, thus resulting in the creation of the Th√©√¢tre des Vampires. In the final segment of the book, Armand explains what occurred to him after the final chapters of Memnoch the Devil. At the end of Memnoch the Devil, Armand rushes into the open daylight and appears to be destroyed in a conflagration. Armand explains to David that by some means beyond his understanding he survived, and ended up on a rooftop in a stairwell protected from further exposure to the sun. However, he is badly burned and unable to move or fully function. While in this delirious state, he makes a mental connection to two children in a nearby apartment‚ÄîSybelle and Benji. The connection is forged through Sybelle's constant piano playing. Eventually, Armand is able to reach out to the children and lead them to him. They believe he is an angel, but are moderately unsurprised when Armand divulges his true nature to them. Armand cannot hunt, so the two agree to trick a drug dealer up to the apartment so that Armand may feed on him. The plan works, and ultimately Armand is fully healed. He becomes friends with Sybelle and Benji and ultimately falls in love with them, showing to a certain degree a lolita complex. He shares his wealth with them without limit, mirroring the relationship Marius had with him to a certain degree. Armand brings them to see Lestat, which he has some concerns about since vampires are traditionally not safe for mortals to be around. After trying to wake Lestat from his catatonic state, Armand returns to Marius's house to discover that Marius has given Benji and Sybelle the Dark Gift. Armand is at first furious at Marius because he wanted Sybelle and Benji to have full, mortal lives. The fact that Benji is ecstatic about the prospect of eternal life, only serves to fuel his anger. Marius explains to Armand that he did it since Armand never could without the two coming to hate him for it. Marius is willing to take the burden of Sybelle and Benji's eventual anger.

Background and education Finlay was born at Cherry Bank in Newhaven,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1840-1855 Edinburgh, the son of William Finlay, a physician, and Ann, daughter of Robert Bannatyne. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University, graduating in medicine in 1864. Legal and political career After entering Middle Temple as a student in 1865, Finlay was called to the bar two years later and built up a successful practice, becoming a Queen's Counsel in 1882. Three years later he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Inverness Burghs, but broke with William Ewart Gladstone over Irish Home Rule and joined the Liberal Unionists in 1886. He lost his seat in 1892 but regained it three years later, the same year he was appointed Solicitor General and knighted. In 1900, Finlay became Attorney General for England and Wales and also became President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club, and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the club's annual dinner. In November 1902 he was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University for three years. For his services in representing the British Empire in a number of international legal arbitrations he was appointed GCMG in 1904, and the following year became a Privy Counsellor. However, in the 1906 general election he again lost his seat, and it was to be another four years before he returned to Parliament as representative for Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. One of his last official acts as Attorney General was to appoint his son, William, as a junior counsel to the Board of Inland Revenue, an appointment which provoked much negative comment.  Judicial career  On 19 December 1916, Finlay became Lord Chancellor in Lloyd George's coalition government, being at the same time created Baron Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn. It is generally thought that Finlay was a temporary appointment: Lloyd George excluded him from the War Cabinet and insisted that he forego the ¬£5,000 pension given to retired lord chancellors. He sat on the Woolsack for three years, and in 1919, on his retirement, was created Viscount Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn on 27 March. The following year he was appointed a British member of the Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and in 1921 was elected a Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice established by the League of Nations. As a judge of the Permanent Court, he participated in the celebrated Lotus case in 1927, where the Court, by a bare majority. laid down the \\"Lotus principle\\" that States may exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction i.e. they may apply their national laws beyond their own borders, in any case where this is not explicitly prohibited.

The islands are part of New Zealand, in total area and uninhabited, except for the permanently manned Raoul Island Station, the northernmost outpost of New Zealand. The islands are listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead an Area Outside Territorial Authority. Toponymy The islands were named after the Breton captain Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec, who visited the islands as part of the d'Entrecasteaux expedition in the 1790s. The topographic particle \\"Kermadec\\" is of Breton origin and is a lieu-dit in Pencran in Finist√®re where ker means village, residence and madec a proper name derived from mad (which means 'good') with the suffix -ec, used to form adjectives indicating a property. The MƒÅori name is RangitƒÅhua which is also used for Raoul island. History Polynesian people settled the Kermadec Islands in around the 14th century (and perhaps previously in the 10th century), but the first Europeans to reach the area‚Äîthe Lady Penrhyn in May 1788‚Äîfound no inhabitants. British, American and Australian whaling vessels cruised offshore in the 19th century and often visited the islands in search of water, wood and food. The first such vessel on record was the whaler Fanny that visited Raoul Island in 1823.Robert Langdon (ed.) Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century, Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.145. European settlers, initially the Bell family, lived on the islands from the early nineteenth century, growing food for the whalers, and remained until 1937. One of the Bell daughters, Bessie Dyke, recounted the family's experience to writer Elsie K. Morton who published their story in 1957 as, Crusoes of Sunday Island. =Raoul Island Station= The Station consists of a government meteorological and radio station, and a hostel for Department of Conservation officers and volunteers, that has been maintained since 1937. It lies on the northern terraces of Raoul Island, at an elevation of about , above the cliffs of Fleetwood Bluff. It is the northernmost inhabited outpost of New Zealand. =Nuclear testing proposals= In 1955 the British Government required a large site remote from population centres to test the new thermonuclear devices it was developing.

The Admiralty suggested the Antipodes Islands.Lorna Arnold and Katherine Pyne, Britain and the H-bomb (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001), p. 96. In May 1955, the Minister for Defence, Selwyn Lloyd, concluded that the Kermadec Islands would be suitable. They were part of New Zealand, so Eden wrote to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sidney Holland, to ask for permission to use the islands. Holland refused, fearing an adverse public reaction in the upcoming 1957 general election in New Zealand.

The subducting Pacific Plate created the Kermadec Trench, an 8 km deep submarine trench, to the east of the islands. The islands lie along the undersea Kermadec Ridge, which runs southwest from the islands towards the North Island of New Zealand and northeast towards Tonga (Kermadec-Tonga Arc). The four main islands are the peaks of volcanoes that rise high enough from the seabed to project above sea level. There are several other volcanoes in the chain that do not reach sea level, but form seamounts with between 65 and 1500 m of water above their peaks. Monowai Seamount, with a depth of 120 m over its peak, is midway between Raoul Island and Tonga. 100 km south of L'Esperance Rock is the little-explored Star of Bengal Bank, probably with submarine volcanoes. Further south are the South Kermadec Ridge Seamounts, the southernmost of which, Rumble IV Seamount, is just 150 km North of the North Island of New Zealand. The ridge eventually connects to White Island in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty, at the northern end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The islands experience many earthquakes from plate movement and volcanism. Raoul and Curtis are both active volcanoes. The volcanoes on the other islands are currently inactive, and the smaller islands are the eroded remnants of extinct volcanoes. From 18 to 21 July 2012, Havre Seamount (near Havre Rock) erupted, breaching the ocean surface from a depth of more than 1100 m and producing a large raft of pumice floating northwest of the volcano. The eruption was not directly observed, but it was located using earthquake and remote sensing data after the pumice raft was spotted by aircraft and encountered by HMNZS Canterbury. Environment =Flora= The islands are recognised by ecologists as a distinct ecoregion, the Kermadec Islands subtropical moist forests. It is a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion, part of the Oceanian realm. The forests are dominated by the red-flowering Kermadec p≈çhutukawa, related to the p≈çhutukawa of New Zealand. The islands are home to 113 native species of vascular plants, of which 23 are endemic, along with mosses (52 native species), lichens and fungi (89 native species). Most of the plant species are derived from New Zealand, with others from the tropical Pacific. 152 human- introduced species of plants have become established on the islands. Dense subtropical forests cover most of Raoul, and formerly covered Macauley. Metrosideros kermadecensis is the dominant forest tree, forming a 10 ‚Äì 15-meter high canopy. A native nikau palm (Rhopalostylis baueri) is another important canopy tree. The forests had a rich understory of smaller trees, shrubs, ferns, and herbs, including Myrsine kermadecensis; Lobelia anceps, Poa polyphylla, Coprosma acutifolia, and Coriaria arborea. Two endemic tree ferns, Cyathea milnei and the rare and endangered Cyathea kermadecensis, are also found in the forests. Areas near the seashore and exposed to salt spray are covered by a distinct community of shrubs and ferns, notably Myoporum obscurum, Coprosma petiolata, Asplenium obtusatum, Cyperus ustulatus, Disphyma australe, and Ficinia nodosa. =Fauna= The islands have no native land mammals. An endemic bird subspecies is the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet. The group has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds, including white-necked and black-winged petrels, wedge- tailed and little shearwaters, sooty terns and blue noddies.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Kermadec Islands. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 3 February 2012. The area also hosts rich habitats for cetaceans. In recent years, increased presences of humpback whales indicate Kermadec Islands functioning as migratory colliders, and varieties of baleen (not in great numbers) and toothed whales including minke whales, sperm whales, less known beaked whales, killer whales, and dolphins frequent in adjacent waters.https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/getmedia/5c7fa634-52dd-4a6d-88cc- cfc146ab4033/bulletin-vol20-kermadec-biodiscovery- expedition-23-duffyetalhttp://www.forestandbird.org.nz/files/file/KermadecsSantuarybooklet_2014.pdf Vast numbers of southern right whales were historically seen in southwestern areas although only a handful of recent confirmations exist around Raoul Island. The deep sea hydrothermal vents along the Kermadec ridge support diverse extremophile communities including the New Zealand blind vent crab.McLay, Colin. \\"New crabs from hydrothermal vents of the Kermadec Ridge submarine volcanoes, New Zealand: Gandalfus gen. nov.(Bythograeidae) and Xenograpsus (Varunidae)(Decapoda: Brachyura).\\" Zootaxa 1524 (2007): 1‚Äì22. Three new records of tropical reef fishes were recorded from the Kermadec Islands Marine Reserve in 2015 after researchers examined hundreds of hours of unused documentary film footage. =Conservation= The introduction of cats, rats, and goats devastated the forests and seabirds. Overgrazing by goats eliminated the forests of Macauley Island, leaving open grasslands, and altered the understory of Raoul Island. Predation by rats and cats reduced the seabird colonies on the main islands from millions of birds to tens of thousands. The New Zealand government has been working for the last few decades to restore the islands. New Zealand declared the islands a nature reserve in 1937, and the sea around them a marine reserve in 1990. The marine reserve surrounds each of the islands and is one of New Zealand's largest at a total area of . Goats were removed from Macauley in 1970 and from Raoul in 1984, and the forests have begun to recover. The islands are still known for their bird life, and seabird colonies presently inhabit offshore islets, which are safe from introduced rats and cats. Efforts are currently underway to remove the rats and cats from the islands, as well as some of the invasive exotic plants. Visits to the islands are restricted by the Department of Conservation. The Department allows visits to Raoul by volunteers assisting in environmental restoration or monitoring projects, and other visitors engaged in nature study. Visits to the other islands are generally restricted to those engaged in scientific study of the islands. On 29 September 2015, New Zealand prime minister John Key announced the creation of the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary, a protected area in the Kermadec Islands region. However, subsequently, fishing companies and iwi bodies filed legal action opposing it, and a coalition deal with the New Zealand First party has led to the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary Bill not passing its second reading as of 2019.

Shikhee D‚Äôiordna was born in Bangladesh, but grew up in England and the USA. In 1999, she moved to New York City. Her initial work was done entirely electronically, and attracted a goth/electropop/electro-industrial following. After two independent label releases Shikhee released The Dividing on her own in 2002, bringing her to the attention of Projekt Records, who signed her and re-released the album. Outburn Magazine calls The Dividing \\"unconventional and adventurous - 10 out of 10\\" while the Boston Phoenix says \\"The Dividing never misfires; it feels almost - but not quite - slick, its arranging smart, its themes ingenious.\\" Jane Magazine said \\"The Dividing is filled with intensely passionate lyrics delivered in low whispers and startling, penetrating screaming.\\" That album involved more live instrumentation, on the album all performed by Shikhee. In the supporting tour she was joined by a live drummer and live keyboardist. She felt that, while dark it was a more optimistic collection than her earlier work, and that her fanbase had become more diversified. Shikhee's third full- length album, Devour, Rise, and Take Flight, was released on February 21, 2006. \\"Dragonfly,\\" the first single for the album, was released on October 18. The album featured more live instrumentation than The Dividing, but embraced a more aggressive electronic sound. This album also saw some creative collaboration with Christopher Jon, Android Lust's live drummer, who co-wrote one track with Shihkee, performed on other tracks and helped mix the album. Also in 2006, a video for \\"Dragonfly,\\" was directed by New York director Dan Ouellette. Her fourth album, The Human Animal, was made available at androidlust.com on July 22, 2010, with an official street date of August 10, 2010. Following her sound-design work in \\"The Human Animal\\" with everyday sounds recorded in New-York City (including birds, trains, crowds and construction sites to name a few), Shikhee decided to focus on this new concept for her fifth album, \\"Crater Vol. 1\\". This record is more experimental but with less vocals than all her previous albums. \\"Crater Vol. 1\\" is electronic music combined to a strong sound-design work, with additional field recordings from Los Angeles and underwater sounds recorded with an hydrophone. This album was financed by her fans on Kickstarter.com. Shikhee took a step further with Android Lust's latest album, \\"Berlin // Crater Vol. 2\\", which was released on August 18, 2017 and once again successfully financed on Kickstarter.com. For this sixth album and second volume of her \\"Crater\\" series, Shikhee went to the city of Berlin to record a big amount of sounds everywhere in Germany's capital and even in her hotel room. These sounds include recordings of the Berlin Wall with contact microphones, tramways, the Berlin Cathedral, the abandoned Iraqi Ambassy etc. After her trip in Berlin, Shikhee got back in her Los Angeles studio which saw her going back to fierce electronics and a strong industrial influence blended with a spectacular sound design work with her sound library from Germany.

History The word Cary derives from the Celtic caer meaning rock, crag or castle, making the term Castle Cary a double-play. Castle Cary is said to take half its name from River Cary, itself an aporia. The first Cary castle was besieged in 1138 and again in 1152. It was originally made of timber frame, as it would have been built by the Normans and inherited their building traditions in wood. Cary first appears in recorded history after the Norman invasion in the 11th century though according to Castle Cary history 'there is evidence the site was occupied and fortified before this. The second castle was abandoned by the mid-15th century in favour of a manor house and the stones pillaged for other buildings in the town. It would seem that the second castle was begun in the 13th century around 1250 and built in Cary stone, indicating that the Hadspen Quarry was in operation at this time. It suggests the Church of All Saints, Castle Cary was begun at a similar time and completed over centuries. Castle Cary Manor Castle Cary Manor was given to the Lovels by King Stephen of Blois, who reigned from 22 December 1135 to 25 October 1154 (18 years 308 days). The castle was besieged by King Stephen of Blois in 1138 in his struggle for the throne of England with his cousin Matilda. When the Lovels failed to produce a male heir during the reign of King Edward III, it passed through marriage to Nicholas de S. Maure, a Baron. It passed again through female heir during the time of King Henry V to Lord Zouches of Harringworth. King Henry VII attainting John Lord Zouch gave the Castle to Robert Willoughby Lord Brook and Lord Zouch's lands at Bridge-water to Lord Daubney. The Zouches had backed King Richard III, the wrong side of the struggle between Richard III and the Tudors. Castle Cary was granted a formal market charter in 1468 from Edward V. It developed as a market town with a number of rural industries, wool flourishing. The Greene King George Hotel is said to have been constructed around this time, rebuilt after a fire and the Market House from Cary stone 150 years later, 1616. Cary flourished in the 16th century, as indicated by its muster roll when threatened by Spanish invasion late in the century. By 1700 Castle Cary was known for its cloth production, when linen weaving replaced wool at the end of the century. In 1837 John Boyd began making horse-hair textiles, for which he is still renowned today and produces on the original 1870 looms. The diary of Reverend James Woodforde born in Ansford in 1740 provides an insight into 18th century life in the Parish. The manor was bought in the 1780s by the Hoares of Stourhead in Wiltshire. In 1785 Henry Hobhouse Esquire purchased Hadspen and Hadspen House as the Hobhouse family seat. In the 18th century Castle Cary changed. The Donnes established flax mills making twine, sail cloth, webbing still situated today in the 1877 Florida House. In 1837 the Cricket Club was founded winning the first and only Olympic medal in 1900, though the possibility of it being contested at the Olympics again has resurfaced. The Market House was rebuilt in 1855 in anticipation of increased trade influenced by the railway station. Today the Castle Cary station today is known as the main station to the Glastonbury Festival. In recent years the town has expanded northwards the centre changing little. Its change starting in the late 18th century was due to the investments of the Hoares and the purchase of Hadpsen and Hadpsen House by Henry Hobhouse Esquire, once part of Castle Cary Manor. Henry Hobhouse Esquire made significant investments in Castle Cary Manor. Castle Cary now comprises a significant part of Hadspen. On 19 June 2004, Castle Cary was granted Fairtrade Village status. Governance The Town Council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The Town Council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The Town Council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of town facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are the responsibility of the district council. The town falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The town is in the Cary electoral ward. This stretches south to the North Cadbury parish, and south west to Babcary. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 5,502. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome constituency represented in the House of Commons, and the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. Transport Castle Cary railway station is on the main Reading to Taunton line and the Heart of Wessex line. It is about north of the town. Every year around the time of the summer solstice this railway station is used by thousands of festival goers who travel to nearby Worthy Farm for the Glastonbury Festival (about 7 miles from Glastonbury) ‚Äì a parade of free buses and coaches take ticket holders to and from the festival site. Bus services operate from the town to Yeovil, Shepton Mallet, Street and Wincanton. The town is on the Monarch's Way long-distance footpath. Landmarks The market hall The Roundhouse Attractions in Castle Cary include a small circular eighteenth- century prison called the roundhouse. This is a temporary prison, or village lock-up. It was built in 1779 by Mr WM Clark for ¬£23, from money left to the poor of Castle Cary in 1605. The structure is circular, stone and has a domed roof. It is in diameter and high with two iron grills for ventilation. The building has an inner and outer door. The interior of the building has a single stone privy. In 1992, the Lord of the Manor, Sir Henry Hoare Bt., gave the building to the parish council. The Market House a grade II* listed building built in 1855 in anticipation of increased trade after the projected arrival of the railway in 1856, by F.C. Penrose. It replaced the former house on the site which had stood since 1616, and incorporating some features from the earlier building. The market house contains the local Castle Cary and District Museum. There is a varied collection of exhibits spread over the two floors of the building. The earliest are local fossils including ammonites and a display about the discovery of an ichthyosaurus at Alford. Local industry and agriculture are represented with displays on the production of rope and hemp and a collection of agricultural implements, tools and relics. A room is dedicated to the life and work of Parson James Woodforde who was born at the Parsonage in nearby Ansford in 1740. He was later curate at Thurloxton before moving to Norfolk. For nearly 45 years he kept a diary recording an existence the very ordinariness of which provides a unique insight into the everyday routines and concerns of 18th century rural England. Hadspen House is Grade II* Listed manor house outside the town. The original farmhouse was built by William Player between 1687 and 1689; the Hobhouse family acquired the house in 1785 and have owned it ever since. The gardens were restored by the garden writer and designer Penelope Hobhouse in the late 1960s. The Grade II* listed Top Mill Building at Higher Flax Mills which was built in the 19th century is on the Heritage at Risk Register. Religious sites The largest church in the town is All Saints', which dates from 1470 and is notable for its high steeple, which contains six bells dating from 1760 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The Cosenes monument in the churchyard, which dates from the 16th century, is on the Heritage at Risk Register. There is also a Methodist church and St Andrew's in the neighbouring parish of Ansford. Notable residents Notable people from the town include the 18th-century diarist James Woodforde who was curate between 1765 and 1775 and Douglas Macmillan, founder of the Macmillan Cancer Relief charity. The Macmillan Way walking trail passes through the town. Education The town has a primary and a secondary school. Castle Cary Community Primary School dates from 1840, whereas Ansford Academy built in 1940 with additional rooms for science, technology, mathematics and modern languages being added in the 1970s. A new ¬£1.7 million Sports Centre was completed in 2005.

Roy Frieden, Physics from Fisher Information: A Unification , 1st Ed. Cambridge University Press, , pp328, 1998 by B. Roy Frieden, Emeritus Professor of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. The principle states that the precipitation of scientific laws can be derived through Fisher information, taking the form of differential equations and probability distribution functions.  Introduction  Physicist John Archibald Wheeler stated that: By using Fisher information, in particular its loss I - J incurred during observation, the EPI principle provides a new approach for deriving laws governing many aspects of nature and human society. EPI can be seen as an extension of information theory that encompasses much theoretical physics and chemistry. Examples include the Schr√∂dinger wave equation and the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution law. EPI has been used to derive a number of fundamental laws of physics, biology, the biophysics of cancer growth, chemistry, and economics. EPI can also be seen as a game against nature, first proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce. The approach does require prior knowledge of an appropriate invariance principle or data.  EPI principle  The EPI principle builds on the well known idea that the observation of a \\"source\\" phenomenon is never completely accurate. That is, information present in the source is inevitably lost when observing the source. The random errors in the observations are presumed to define the probability distribution function of the source phenomenon. That is, \\"the physics lies in the fluctuations.\\" The information loss is postulated to be an extreme value. Denoting the Fisher information in the data as \\\\mathcal{I}, and that in the source as \\\\mathcal{J}, the EPI principle states that : \\\\mathcal{I} \\\\- \\\\mathcal{J} = \\\\mathrm {Extremum} Since the data are generally imperfect versions of the source, the extremum for most situations is a minimum. Thus there is a comforting tendency for any observation to describe its source faithfully. The EPI principle may be solved for the unknown system amplitudes via the usual Euler-Lagrange equations of variational calculus.  Books  *Frieden, B.

Part of the KiCad suite Schematic capture or schematic entry is a step in the design cycle of electronic design automation (EDA) at which the electronic diagram, or electronic schematic of the designed electronic circuit is created by a designer. This is done interactively with the help of a schematic capture tool also known as schematic editor. The circuit design is the first step of actual design of an electronic circuit. Typically sketches are drawn on paper, and then entered into a computer using a schematic editor. Therefore schematic entry is said to be a front-end operation of several others in the design flow. Despite the complexity of modern components ‚Äì huge ball grid arrays and tiny passive components ‚Äì schematic capture is easier today than it has been for many years. CAD software is easier to use and is available in full-featured expensive packages, very capable mid-range packages that sometimes have free versions and completely free versions that are either open source or directly linked to a printed circuit board fabrication company. In past years, schematic diagrams with mostly discrete components were fairly readable. However, with the newer high pin-count parts and with the almost universal use of standard letter or A4 sized paper, schematics have become less so. Many times, there will be a single large part on a page with nothing but pin reference keys to connect it to other pages. Readability levels can be enhanced by using buses and superbuses, related pins can be connected into a common bus and routed to other pages. Buses don't need to be just the traditional address or data bus directly linked pins. A bus grouping can also be used for related uses, such as all analog input or all communications related pin functions. Other considerations After the circuit design is captured in a schematic, most EDA tools allow the design to be simulated. Schematic capture involves not only entering the circuits into the CAD system, but also generally calls for decisions that may seem more appropriate for later in the design, such as package choice. Although you may be able to change the package later, many PCB CAD systems ask you to choose both the part and package when placing it into the schematic capture program. This also brings into play such considerations as prototyping and assembly. In a high- volume assembly environment, there will be plenty of opportunities for DFM analysis. However, in a rapid prototyping environment such as at assembly houses specializing in low-volume/high-mix and quick turnaround times, the pick and place machines are programmed directly from the board layout files. Careful package selection during schematic capture will save time during the assembly and debug process. With new parts, the CAD system may not have your chosen component in its parts library, so you may need to create the parts library yourself. Again, you may at the time not be overly concerned with the package, but careful creation of the part library will save time and risk later. After the circuit design is captured in a schematic, then the PCB layout can begin.

Headquartered in Warsaw, it is responsible for spearheading the development of science across the country by a society of distinguished scholars and a network of research institutes. It was established in 1951, during the early period of the Polish People's Republic following World War II. History The Polish Academy of Sciences is a Polish state-sponsored institution of higher learning, headquartered in Warsaw, that was established by the merger of earlier learned societies, including the Polish Academy of Learning (Polska Akademia Umiejƒôtno≈õci, abbreviated PAU), with its seat in Krak√≥w, and the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning, which had been founded in the late 18th century. The Polish Academy of Sciences functions as a learned society acting through an elected assembly of leading scholars and research institutions. The Academy has also, operating through its committees, become a major scientific advisory body. Another aspect of the Academy is its coordination and overseeing of numerous (several dozen) research institutes. PAS institutes employ over 2,000 people and are funded by about a third of the Polish government's budget for science.Ustawa z dnia 30 kwietnia 2010 r. o Polskiej Akademii Nauk.

Gehlen was instrumental in the negotiations to establish an official West German intelligence service on the basis of Gehlen Organization from the early 1950s. In 1956, the Gehlen Organization was transferred to the West German government and formed the core of the Federal Intelligence Service, the Federal Republic of Germany's official foreign intelligence service, and Gehlen served as its first president until his retirement in 1968.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/03/18/cia- declassifies-its-records-on-dealings-with-ex- nazis/2fa93bad-62ee-42f2-833a-b1d04bc63079/, CIA Declassifies Its Records On Dealings With Ex- Nazishttps://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/germany/gehlen.htm, Gehlen Organization While this was a civilian office, he was also a lieutenant- general in the Reserve forces of the Bundeswehr, the highest-ranking reserve- officer in the military of West Germany.Pahl, Magnus. Fremde Heere Ost: Hitlers milit√§rische Feindaufkl√§rung, p. 32, Ch. Links Verlag, 2013, . He received the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1968.  Early life  Gehlen was born into a Catholic family; his father was a book-seller in Erfurt. In 1920, Gehlen joined the Reichswehr.  Career  After graduating from the German Staff College in 1935, Gehlen was promoted to captain and assigned to the German General Staff.Reinhard Gehlen ‚Äì Biografie WHO'S WHO Gehlen served on the General Staff until 1936, and was promoted to major in 1939; at the time of the German attack on Poland (1 September 1939) he was a staff officer in an infantry division. In 1940, he became liaison officer to Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, Army Commander-in-Chief; and later was transferred to the staff of General Franz Halder, the Chief of the German General Staff. In July 1941, he received a promotion to lieutenant-colonel and was sent to the Eastern Front, where he was assigned as senior intelligence-officer to the Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) section of the Staff. =Head of FHO= The anti‚ÄìCommunist espionage networks of the Gehlen Organization remained in place after Red Army conquest and consolidation of Soviet hegemony in the east of Europe. In spring of 1942, Gehlen assumed command of the Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) from Colonel Eberhard Kinzel. Before the Wehrmacht disasters in the Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 ‚Äì 2 February 1943), a year into the German war against the Soviet Union, Gehlen understood that the FHO required fundamental re-organisation, and secured a staff of army linguists and geographers, anthropologists, lawyers, and junior military officers who would improve the FHO as a military- intelligence organisation despite the Nazi ideology of Slavic inferiority.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 13. =Hitler assassination plot= In summer 1944, Colonel Henning von Tresckow, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, and General Adolf Heusinger asked Gehlen to participate in their plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.Reinhard Gehlen, p. 97-99. As head of the FHO, Gehlen allowed the military conspirators to make their plans under his protection; moreover, he was present at their meetings at Berchtesgaden; yet, after the bomb plot failed on 20 July, he escaped falling victim to Hitler's revenge.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 38. =Dismissal= Gehlen's cadre of FHO intelligence-officers produced accurate field-intelligence about the Red Army that contradicted rear-echelon perceptions of the Eastern battle front, which Hitler dismissed as defeatism, philosophically harmful to the Nazi cause against \\"Judeo-Bolshevism\\" in Russia. In April 1945, despite the accurate military intelligence, Hitler dismissed Gehlen, soon after his promotion to major general.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 44. =Preparation for Post-War= The FHO collection of both military and political intelligence from captured Red Army soldiers assured Gehlen's post‚ÄìWWII survival as a Western anti‚ÄìCommunist spymaster, with networks of spies and secret agents in the countries of Soviet-occupied Europe. During the German war against the Soviet Union in 1941‚Äì45, Gehlen's FHO collected much tactical military-intelligence about the Red Army, and much strategic, political intelligence about the Soviet Union. Understanding that the Soviet Union would defeat and occupy the Third Reich, Gehlen ordered the FHO intelligence files copied to microfilm; the FHO files proper were stored in water-tight drums and buried in various locations in the Austrian Alps. They amounted to fifty cases of German intelligence about the Soviet Union which were at Gehlen's disposal for sale to Western intelligence services.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 52. Meanwhile, as of 1946, when the Soviets consolidated their hegemony and sphere of influence in central, eastern, and south-eastern Europe as agreed at the Potsdam Conference of 1945 and demarcated with what became known as the Iron Curtain, the Western Allies of World War II, the U.S., Britain, France, had no sources of covert information within the countries where the occupying Red Army had vanquished the Wehrmacht. After the Second World War On 22 May 1945, Gehlen surrendered to the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) of the U.S. Army in Bavaria and was taken to Camp King, near Oberursel, and interrogated by Captain John R. Boker. The American Army recognised his potential value as a spymaster with great knowledge of Soviet forces and anti-communist intelligence contacts in the USSR. In exchange for his liberty and the liberty of his command (prisoners of the U.S. Army), Gehlen offered the Counter Intelligence Corps access to the FHO‚Äôs intelligence archives, and to his anti-communist espionage network in the Soviet Union, known later as the Gehlen Organization. Boker removed his name and those of his Wehrmacht command from the official lists of German prisoners of war, and transferred seven FHO senior officers to join Gehlen. Reinhard Gehlen as a Wehrmacht Major General in 1945 The FHO archives were unearthed and secretly taken to Camp King, ostensibly without the knowledge of the camp commander. By the end of summer 1945, Boker had the support of Brigadier General Edwin Sibert, the G2 (senior intelligence officer) of the U.S. Twelfth Army Group,Simpson, pp. 41‚Äì42. who arranged the secret transport of Gehlen, his officers and the FHO intelligence archives, authorized by his superiors in the chain of command, General Walter Bedell Smith (chief of staff for General Eisenhower), who worked with William Donovan (former OSS chief) and Allen Dulles (OSS chief), who also was the OSS station-chief in Bern. On 20 September 1945, Gehlen and three associates were flown from the American Zone of Occupation in Germany to the U.S., to become spies for the U.S. Government. In July 1946, the U.S. officially released Gehlen and returned him to Occupied Germany.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 63. On 6 December 1946, he began espionage operations against the Soviet Union, by establishing what was known to U.S. Intelligence as the Gehlen Organisation or \\"the Org\\", a secret intelligence service composed of former intelligence officers of the Wehrmacht and members of the SS and the SD, which was headquartered first at Oberursel, near Frankfurt, then at Pullach, near Munich. The organisation's cover-name was the South German Industrial Development Organization. Gehlen initially selected 350 ex-intelligence officers of the Wehrmacht as staff; eventually, the organisation comprised some 4,000 anti-communist secret agents. Gehlen Organisation After he started working for the U.S. Government, Gehlen was subordinate to US Army G-2 (Intelligence). He resented this arrangement and in 1947, the year after his Organisation was established, Gehlen arranged for a transfer and became subordinate to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The agency kept close control of the Gehlen Organisation, because for many years during the Cold War of 1945‚Äì91, its agents were the CIA‚Äôs only eyes and ears on the ground in the countries of the Eastern Bloc. East German propaganda in 1957 Between 1947 and 1955, agents of the Gehlen Organisation interviewed every German PoW who returned to West Germany from captivity in the Soviet Union. The network employed hundreds of former Wehrmacht and SS officers, and also had close contacts with the anti-Communist organisations of the East European √©migr√© communities in Western Europe. They observed the operations of the railroad systems, airfields, and ports of the USSR, and their secret agents infiltrated the Baltic Soviet Republics and the Ukrainian SSR. Among their successes was Operation Bohemia, a major effort of anti-communist counter-espionage.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 157. The security and efficacy of the Gehlen Organisation were compromised by East German moles within it, such as Hans Clemens, Erwin Tiebel and Heinz Felfe who were feeding information to the Soviets while in the Org and later, while in the BND that was headed by Gehlen.https://books.google.ca/books?id=s2aN5ETA_GQC&pg;=PA273&dq;=moles+in+the+Gehlen+org&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj3sfq57LrkAhULm- AKHbmNCN0Q6AEIWjAH#v=onepage&q;=moles%20in%20the%20Gehlen%20org&f;=false, A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century, page 273 (All three were eventually discovered and convicted in 1963.)https://books.google.ca/books?id=k-O- DAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA153&dq;=erwin+tiebel+convicted&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjLyMOe87rkAhUGhuAKHRwsBI4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q;=erwin%20tiebel%20convicted&f;=false, The Stasi: The East German Intelligence and Security Service, page 153 There were also Communists and their sympathizers within the CIA and the SIS (MI6), especially Kim Philby, himself a Soviet secret agent.https://books.google.ca/books?id=I84rBQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA344&lpg;=PA344&dq;=gehlen+org+moles&source;=bl&ots;=WLNTGxCcT2&sig;=ACfU3U2uD0Zu8wHhNOAczRyNJovic851gg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjhxpnx37rkAhUGTd8KHbRcB9MQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=gehlen%20org%20moles&f;=false, Global Secret and Intelligence Services I: Hidden Systems As such information appeared, Gehlen, personally, and the Gehlen Organisation, officially, were attacked by the governments of the Western powers.https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ng7myCguewAC&pg;=PA136&dq;=moles+in+the+Gehlen+org&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj3sfq57LrkAhULm- AKHbmNCN0Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q;=moles%20in%20the%20Gehlen%20org&f;=false, Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games, page 136-137 The British government was especially hostile towards Gehlen, and the politically liberal British press ensured full publication of the existence of the Gehlen Organisation, which compromised the operation.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 172. Federal Intelligence Service (BND) The Gehlen Organisation in transition: CIA report on the negotiations to establish the BND (1952) of West Germany. Eleven years after the end of World War II, on 1 April 1956, the U.S. Government and the CIA formally transferred the Gehlen Organisation to the authority of what was by then the Federal Republic of Germany, under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (1949‚Äì63). By way of that transference of geopolitical sponsorship, the anti‚ÄìCommunist Gehlen Organisation became the nucleus of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND, Federal Intelligence Service). As the spymaster of the Gehlen Organisation, Gehlen became president of the BND as an espionage service, until he was forced out of office in 1968. The end of Gehlen‚Äôs career as a spymaster resulted from a confluence of events in West Germany: the discovery of the professional secret agent, Heinz Felfe, (a former SS lieutenant and a Soviet agent) working at BND headquarters;BND cryptanalysts deciphered KGB messages that led to Felfe. political estrangement from Adenauer, in 1963, which aggravated his professional problems; and the inefficiency of the BND consequent to Gehlen‚Äôs poor leadership and continual inattention to the business of espionage as national defence. Gehlen's refusal to correct reports with questionable content strained the organization's credibility, and dazzling achievements became an infrequent commodity. A veteran agent remarked at the time that the BND pond then contained some sardines, though a few years earlier the pond had been alive with sharks.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 213 The fact that the BND could score certain successes despite East German communist Stasi interference, internal malpractice, inefficiencies and infighting, was primarily due to select members of the staff who took it upon themselves to step up and overcome then existing maladies. Abdication of responsibility by Reinhard Gehlen was the malignancy; cronyism remained pervasive, even nepotism (at one time Gehlen had 16 members of his extended family on the BND payroll).H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 245 Only slowly did the younger generation then advance to substitute new ideas for some of the bad habits caused mainly by Gehlen's semi-retired attitude and frequent holiday absences. Gehlen was forced out of the BND due to \\"political scandal within the ranks\\", according to one source, https://books.google.ca/books?id=I84rBQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA343&dq;=Gehlen+Org+eyes+and+ears+of+the+CIA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj5kcy4-rrkAhVLJt8KHc0KCxUQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q;=Gehlen%20Org%20eyes%20and%20ears%20of%20the%20CIA&f;=false, Global Secret and Intelligence Services I: Hidden Systems, page 345 He retired in 1968 as a civil servant of West Germany, classified as a Ministerialdirektor, a senior grade with a generous pension. His successor, Bundeswehr Brigadier General Gerhard Wessel, immediately called for a program of modernization and streamlining.H√∂hne & Zolling, p. 255 Criticism Several publications have criticized the fact that Gehlen allowed former Nazis to work for the agencies. The authors of the book A Nazi Past: Recasting German Identity in Postwar Europe state that Reichard Gehlen simply did not want to know the backgrounds of the men that the BND hired in the 1950s.https://books.google.ca/books?id=MrONBwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA288&dq;=Reinhard+gehlen+nazis&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjWhbb09rXkAhWKmeAKHYU4CwkQ6AEITjAF#v=onepage&q;=Reinhard%20gehlen%20nazis&f;=false, page 288 The American National Security Archive states that \\"he employed numerous former Nazis and known war criminals\\".https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB146/index.htm, The CIA and Nazi War Criminals, 2005, Released Under Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 146 An article in The Independent on 29 June 2018 made this statement about BND employees:https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/himmler-daughter- germany-bnd-foreign-intelligence-ss-nazi-hitler-war-criminals-evaded- justice-a8422726.html, Himmler's daughter worked for Germany's foreign intelligence agency in 1960s, officials admit > \\"Operating until 1956, when it was superseded by the BND, the Gehlen > Organisation was allowed to employ at least 100 former Gestapo or SS > officers. ...

Critchfield who worked with the Gehlen Organization from 1949 to 1956. In 2001, he said that \\"almost everything negative that has been written about Gehlen, [as an] ardent ex-Nazi, one of Hitler's war criminals ... is all far from the fact,\\" as quoted in the Washington Post. Critchfield added that Gehlen hired former Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service of the Reichsf√ºhrer- SS) men \\"reluctantly, under pressure from German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to deal with 'the avalanche of subversion hitting them from East Germany'\\".https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/03/18/cia- declassifies-its-records-on-dealings-with-ex- nazis/2fa93bad-62ee-42f2-833a-b1d04bc63079/, CIA Declassifies Its Records On Dealings With Ex-Nazis Legacy Gehlen's memoirs were published in 1977, (World Publishers, New York). In the same year another book was published about him, The General Was a Spy, by Heinz Hoehne and Herman Zolling. (Coward, McCann and Geoghegan, New York.) A Review of the latter, published by the CIA in 1996, calls it a \\"poor book\\" and goes on to allege that \\"so much of it is sheer garbage\\" because of many errors. The CIA Review also discusses another book, Gehlen, Spy of the Century, by E. H. Cookridge. (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1971) and claims that it is \\"chock full of errors\\". The CIA Review is kinder when speaking of Gehlen's memoirs but makes this comment,https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent- csi/vol16no3/html/v16i3a06p_0001.htm, INTELLIGENCE IN RECENT PUBLIC LITERATURE > \\"Gehlen's descriptions of most of his so-called successes in the political > intelligence field are, in my opinion, either wishful thinking or self- > delusion. ...

The Vend√©e is a coastal region, located immediately south of the Loire River in western France. Initially, the war was similar to the 14th-century Jacquerie peasant uprising, but quickly acquired themes considered by the Jacobin government in Paris to be counter- revolutionary, and Royalist. The uprising headed by the newly formed Catholic and Royal Army was comparable to the Chouannerie, which took place in the area north of the Loire. The departments included in the uprising, called the Vend√©e Militaire, included the area between the Loire and the Layon rivers: Vend√©e (Marais, Bocage Vend√©en, Collines Vend√©ennes), part of Maine-et-Loire west of the Layon, and the portion of Deux-S√®vres west of the River Thouet. Having secured their pays, the deficiencies of the Vendean army became more apparent. Lacking a unified strategy (or army) and fighting a defensive campaign, from April onwards the army lost cohesion and its special advantages. Successes continued for some time: Thouars was taken in early May and Saumur in June; there were victories at Ch√¢tillon and Vihiers. After this string of victories, the Vendeans turned to a protracted siege of Nantes, for which they were unprepared and which stalled their momentum, giving the government in Paris sufficient time to send more troops and experienced generals. Tens of thousands of civilians were massacred by the infernal columns. Historians such as Reynald Secher have described these events as \\"genocide\\", but most scholars reject the use of the word as inaccurate. Ultimately, the uprising was suppressed using draconian measures. The president of Saint-Simon Foundation Fran√ßois Furet concludes that the repression in the Vend√©e \\"not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale but also a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region's identity ... The war aptly epitomizes the depth of the conflict ... between religious tradition and the revolutionary foundation of democracy.\\"Fran√ßois Furet and Mona Ozouf, eds. A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution (1989), p. 175. Background The massacre of 150 to 200 Vendean Republicans by Vendean Royalists in Machecoul was the starting event of the War in the Vend√©e. Vendean rebel. Painting by Julien Le Blant Class differences were not as great in the Vend√©e as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vend√©e, the local nobility seems to have been more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vend√©e.Alexis de Tocqueville, The Old Regime and the Revolution, pp. 122‚Äì23 The conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the population to their Catholic faith. When the revolutionaries wanted to reduce the Church's influence, people of the Vend√©e region considered this unimaginable. In 1791, two representatives on mission informed the National Assembly of the disquieting condition of Vend√©e, and this news was quickly followed by the exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rou√´rie. It was not until the social unrest and the fear of The Terror (a period between 1793 and 1794 where tens of thousands of people were beheaded by use of guillotine) combined with the external pressures from the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) and the introduction of a levy of 300,000 on the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793, that the region erupted.James Maxwell Anderson (2007). Daily Life During the French Revolution, Greenwood Publishing Group, . p. 205Fran√ßois Furet (1996). The French Revolution, 1770‚Äì1814 Blackwell Publishing, France . p. 124 The Civil Constitution of the Clergy required all clerics to swear allegiance to it and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical National Constituent Assembly. All but seven of the 160 bishops refused the oath, as did about half of the parish priests.Joes, Anthony James Resisting Rebellion: The History and Politics of Counterinsurgency 2006 University Press of Kentucky . p. 51 Persecution of the clergy and of the faithful was the first trigger of the rebellion; the second being conscription. Nonjuring priests were exiled or imprisoned and women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets. Religious orders were suppressed and Church property confiscated. On 3 March 1793, virtually all the churches were ordered closed.Joes, p. 52 Soldiers confiscated sacramental vessels and the people were forbidden to place crosses on graves. Nearly all the purchasers of church land were bourgeois; very few peasants benefited from the sales.Charles Tilly, \\"Local Conflicts in the Vend√©e before the rebellion of 1793\\", _French Historical Studies_ II, Fall 1961, p. 219 The March 1793 conscription requiring Vendeans to fill their district's quota of the national total of 300,000 enraged the populace, who took up arms instead as \\"The Catholic Army\\", \\"Royal\\" being added later, and fought for \\"above all the reopening of their parish churches with their former priests.\\"Joes, pp. 52‚Äì53 Although town dwellers were more likely to support the Revolution in the Vend√©e,Charles Tilly, \\"Local Conflicts\\", p. 211 support for the revolution among the rural peasantry was not unknown. Many lived on monastery properties, and they overwhelmingly embraced the Revolution after these lands were seized and redistributed among them by the republican government.Charles Tilly, \\"Civil Constitution and Counter-Revolution in southern Anjou,\\" _French Historical Studies_ , I no. 2 1959, p. 175 Outbreak of revolt Sacred Heart patch of the Vendean royalist insurgents. The French motto 'Dieu, le Roi' means 'God, the King'. There were other levy riots across France when regions started to draft men into the army in response to the Levy Decree in February. The reaction in the northwest in early March was particularly pronounced with large-scale rioting verging on insurrection. By early April, in areas north of the Loire, order had been restored by the revolutionary government, but south of the Loire in four departments that became known as the Vend√©e militaire there were few troops to control rebels and what had started as rioting quickly took on the form of a full insurrection led by priests and the local nobility.Donald M. G. Sutherland (2003). The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order, Blackwell Publishing France, . p. 155 Within a few weeks the rebel forces had formed a substantial, if ill-equipped, army, the Royal and Catholic Army, supported by two thousand irregular cavalry and a few captured artillery pieces. The main force of the rebels operated on a much smaller scale, using guerrilla tactics, supported by the insurgents' unparalleled local knowledge and the good-will of the people.General Hoche and Counterinsurgency =Geographic coverage= The administrative Vend√©e d√©partement (green), the \\"Military Vend√©e\\" (pink) where most of the insurrection took place and the Vir√©e de Galerne (black, red and blue arrows) Geographically, the insurrection occurred within a rough quadrilateral approximately wide. The territory defied description in the terms of the redistricting of 1790, nor did it align itself to descriptors used in the Ancien R√©gime; the heart of the movement lay in the forests, with Cholet at its center, in the wild districts of the old county of Anjou, in the Breton marshlands between Montaigu and the sea. It included parts of the old Poitiers and Tours, the departements of Maine-et-Loire, the Vend√©e, and Deux S√®vres, but never completely fell under insurgent control. The further the land was from Paris (the seat of revolutionary power) the more counter-revolutionary uprisings occurred.Fran√ßois Furet, Mona Ozouf, A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, p. 165. Vend√©e military response The revolt began in earnest in March 1793, as a rejection of the mass conscription edict. In February, the National Convention had voted to approve a levy of three hundred thousand men, to be chosen by lot among the unmarried men in each commune. Thus, the arrival of recruiters reminded locals of the methods of the monarchy, aroused resistance nearly everywhere in the countryside, and set in motion the first serious signs of sedition. Much of this resistance was quelled quickly, but in the lower Loire, in the and in the Vendean bocage, the situation was more serious and more protracted. Youths from communes surrounding Cholet, a large textile town on the boundary between the two regions, invaded the town and killed the commander of the National Guard, a \\"patriotic\\" (pro-revolutionary) manufacturer. Within a week, violence had spread to the Breton marshlands; peasants overran the town of Machecoul on 11 March, and several hundred Republican citizens were massacred. A large band of peasants under the leadership of Jacques Cathelineau and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet seized Saint-Florent-le-Vieil on 12 March. By mid-March, a minor revolt against conscription had turned into full-fledged insurrection.Furet and Ozouf, pp. 165‚Äì66. The Republic was quick to respond, dispatching over 45,000 troops to the area. The first pitched battle was on the night of 19 March. A Republican column of 2,000, under general Louis Henri Fran√ßois de Marc√©, moving from La Rochelle to Nantes, was intercepted north of Chantonnay near the Gravereau bridge (Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges), over the river le Petit- Lay.Louis Pr√©vost (comte) de la Bouteti√®re, Le chevalier de Sapinaud et les chefs vend√©ens du centre, Paris, 1869, p. 25 After six hours of fighting, rebel reinforcements arrived and routed the Republican forces. In the north, on 22 March, another Republican force was routed near Chalonnes-sur- Loire.Jacques, Dictionary, P‚ÄìZ, p. 810. There followed a series of skirmishes and armed contacts: =Battle of Bressuire= On 3 May 1793, Bressuire fell to Vend√©en forces led by La Rochejacquelein.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 336 Longman Group 1989 =Battle of Thouars= La Rochejaquelein and the Marquis de Lescure leading troops on the pont de Vrine On 5 May 1793, the main clash took place on the Pont de Vrine, the bridge over the stream leading into Thouars. The Vend√©ens proved unable to take the bridge for six hours, until Louis Marie de Lescure (fighting in his first battle) showed himself alone on the bridge under enemy fire and encouraged his men to follow him, which they did, crossing the bridge. The Republicans there were taken from behind by the cavalry under Charles de Bonchamps, which had crossed the river at a ford. Despite the arrival of reinforcements, the Republicans were routed and withdrew towards the city. The insurgents, headed by Henri de La Rochejacquelein, took the rampart by force and poured into the city, and the Republican troops quickly capitulated. The Vend√©ens seized a large amount of arms and gunpowder, but allowed the captured Republican forces to leave, after having sworn to no longer fight in the Vend√©e and had their hair shaved off so they could be recognised lest they went back on their word and were recaptured. =Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte= On 25 May 1793 the Catholic and royalist army took Fontenay-le-Comte. Lescure led his men in a courageous charge under enemy fire, shouting 'Long live the king!' and braving cannonfire, which left him unharmed. Likewise La Rochejacquelein wore his distinctive three red handkerchiefs on his head, waist and neck even though the gunners in the Republican forces were aiming for them. Following the victory his friends decided to copy him and all decided to wear three red handkerchiefs too so that La Rochejacquelein could not be distinguished by the enemy in the future. After this the only Vend√©e towns remaining in the control of the Republic were Nantes and Les Sables d'Olonne.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p. 338 =Battle of Saumur= On 9 June 1793, Vendean insurgents commanded by Jacques Cathelineau captured the town of Saumur from Louis-Alexandre Berthier. The victory gave the insurgents a massive supply of arms, including 50 cannons. This was the high point of the insurgency.Jacques, Dictionary, P‚ÄìZ, p. 916. The Vendeans had never before attempted to take such a large town, and they captured it in a single day, inflicting heavy losses on its Republican defenders. Many prisoners were taken, some of whom went over to the Vendean cause, while many of the citizens fled to Tours.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p. 342 Granville, 14 November 1793 =Battle of Nantes= On 24 June 1793, the commanders of the Catholic and royalist army issued an ultimatum to the mayor of Nantes, Baco de la Chapelle to surrender the city or they would massacre the garrison.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p. 346 On 29 June they began an assault with a force of 40,000. Inside the city were Republicans from the surrounding countryside who had fled to Nantes for safety, fortifying the defenders with tales of the horrors that the rebels inflicted on towns they managed to take. Baco de la Chapelle stood on a dustcart that he called the 'chariot of victory' to urge the people on, even after he had been wounded in the leg. Poor coordination between the four Vendean armies led by Charette, Bonchamps, Cathelineau and Lyrot hampered the assault, and Cathelineau's forces were delayed in their deployment by fighting along the Erdre river with a Republican battalion. Cathelineau himself was shot at the head of his forces, causing his men to lose heart and retreat; ultimately, the Vendeans were unable to take the city.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p. 348 In October 1793, in order to punish the Vendean prisoners taken after the failure of the siege of Nantes, Jean-Baptiste Carrier ordered them to be shot en masse. When this proved impractical, he had the prisoners rounded up and put out on the Loire river in boats equipped with trap-door bottoms; when these opened the victims were left to drown. On this occasion it was rumored that female prisoners were stripped and tied up with men before being sent to their deaths, the so-called Republican Marriage. Some later historians dispute this story as a counter- revolutionary myth.Alain G√©rard (1993). La Vend√©e: 1789‚Äì1793. pp. 265‚Äì66. =First Battle of Ch√¢tillon= On July 5, 1793, the First Battle of Ch√¢tillon took place at Ch√¢tillon-sur-S√®vre near the commune of Maul√©on. In that action, Marquis de la Rochejaquelein commanding 20,000 Vendean Royalists attacked a French Republican force led by General Fran√ßois Joseph Westermann. The Vendean Royalists were victorious, killing and wounding 5,000 French Republicans. Among those killed in the battle was French Republican General Chambon.Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998, p. 48. The capture of Fran√ßois de Charette, 1796 =Battle of Vihiers= The Vendeans won a victory over the revolutionary army led by Santerre at the Battle of Vihiers on 18 July 1793.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p. 352 =Battle of Lu√ßon= The Battle of Lu√ßon was actually a series of three engagements fought over four weeks, the first on 15 July and the last on 14 August 1793, between Republican forces under Augustin Tuncq and Vendean forces. The engagement on 14 August, fought near the town of Lu√ßon was actually the conclusion of three engagements between Maurice d'Elb√©e's Vendean insurgents and the Republican army. On 15 July, Claude Sandoz and a garrison of 800 had repulsed 5,000 insurgents led by d'Elbee; on 28 July, Tuncq drove off a second attempt; two weeks later, Tuncq and his 5,000 men routed 30,000 insurgents under the personal command of Fran√ßois de Charette.Tony Jacques, Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F‚ÄìO, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p. 604. =Battle of Montaigu= The Battle of Montaigu was fought on 21 September 1793 when the Vend√©ens attacked general Jean-Michel Beysser's French Republican division. Taken by surprise, this division fought back but lost 400 men, including many captured. Some of these prisoners were summarily executed by the Vendeens and their bodies later found in the castle wells by troops under Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber. =Second Battle of Tiffauges= The Battle of Tiffauges was fought on 19 September 1793 between Royalist military leaders against Republican troops under Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber and Canclaux. =Second Battle of Ch√¢tillon= On October 11, 1793, the Second Battle of Ch√¢tillon took place at Ch√¢tillon-sur-S√®vre near the commune of Maul√©on. In that action, a Vendean Royalist force led by Louis Marie de Lescure and Charles de Bonchamps skirmished with a column of French Republican soldiers from the Coasts of La Rochelle Army. The Republican force commanded by Alexis Chalbos was routed by the Vendean Royalists. Later in the evening of the same day, Fran√ßois Joseph Westermann led a Republican raiding party and attacked the Vendean encampment inflicting losses upon the rebel fighters and non- combatants. The next day the Vendean Royalists withdrew toward Mortagne-sur- S√®vre. =Battle of Tremblaye= The Battle of Tremblaye (15 October 1793) took place near Cholet during the war in the Vend√©e, and was a Republican victory over the Vend√©ens. The Vendean leader Lescure was seriously injured in the fighting.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p. 372 =Defeat (October‚ÄìDecember 1793)= Mass shootings at Nantes, 1793 On 1 August 1793, the Committee of Public Safety ordered General Jean-Baptiste Carrier to carry out a \\"pacification\\" of the region by complete physical destruction.Sutherland, Donald (2003). The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order p. 222, Blackwell Publishing These orders were not carried out immediately, but a steady stream of demands for total destruction persisted. Crossing the Loire: General Lescure, wounded, crosses the Loire at Saint-Florent (17 October 1793), by Jules Girardet The Republican army was reinforced, benefiting from the first men of the lev√©e en masse and reinforcements from Mainz. The Vendean army had its first serious defeat at the Battle of Cholet on 17 October; worse for the rebels, their army was split. In October 1793 the main force, commanded by Henri de la Rochejaquelein and numbering some 25,000 (followed by thousands of civilians of all ages), crossed the Loire, headed for the port of Granville where they expected to be greeted by a British fleet and an army of exiled French nobles. Arriving at Granville, they found the city surrounded by Republican forces, with no British ships in sight. Their attempts to take the city were unsuccessful. During the retreat, the extended columns fell prey to Republican forces; suffering from hunger and disease, they died in the thousands. The force was defeated in the last, decisive Battle of Savenay on 23 December. Among those executed the following day was lieutenant-general Jacques Alexis de Verteuil, but some historians assert that after the battle of Savenay the rebellion was still going on. After the Battle of Savenay (December 1793), General Westermann reported to his political masters at the convention: \\"The Vend√©e is no more ... According to your orders, I have trampled their children beneath our horses' feet; I have massacred their women, so they will no longer give birth to brigands. I do not have a single prisoner to reproach me. I have exterminated them all.\\"Mark Levene (2005). The Rise of the West and the Coming of Genocide.

Such killing of civilians would have been an explicit violation of the convention's orders to Westermann.Jean-Cl√©ment Martin, Guerre de Vend√©e, dans l'Encyclop√©die Bordas, Histoire de la France et des Fran√ßais, Paris, √âditions Bordas, 1999, p 2084, et Contre-R√©volution, R√©volution et Nation en France, 1789‚Äì1799, p. 218. Several thousand living Vend√©an prisoners were being held by Westerman's forces though when the letter was supposedly written,Jean-Cl√©ment Martin, Contre-R√©volution, R√©volution et Nation en France, 1789‚Äì1799, √©ditions du Seuil, collection Points, 1998, p. 219 but some historians believe that letter of Westermann never existed.Fr√©d√©ric Augris, Henri Forestier, g√©n√©ral √† 18 ans, √âditions du Choletais, 1996 Aftermath With the decisive Battle of Savenay (December 1793) came formal orders for forced evacuation; also, a 'scorched earth' policy was initiated: farms were destroyed, crops and forests burned and villages razed. There were many reported atrocities and a campaign of mass killing universally targeted at residents of the Vend√©e regardless of combatant status, political affiliation, age or sex.Adam Jones, Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction, Routledge/Taylor & Francis Publishers 2006, p. 7 One specific target were the women of the region. Since they were seen, in a way, that they were carrying anti-revolutionary babies, they were seen as primary targets. From January to May 1794, 20,000 to 50,000 Vendean civilians were massacred by the colonnes infernales (\\"infernal columns\\") of the general Louis Marie Turreau.Louis-Marie Cl√©net, Les colonnes infernales, Perrin, collection V√©rit√©s et L√©gendes, 1993, p. 221Roger Dupuy, La R√©publique jacobine, tome 3 de la Nouvelle histoire de la France contemporaine, pp. 268‚Äì69.Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ¬´ D√©truisez la Vend√©e ! ¬ª Regards crois√©s sur les victimes et destructions de la guerre de Vend√©e, La Roche-sur-Yon, Centre vend√©en de recherches historiques, 2007, pp. 140, 466 Among those killed towards the end of the conflict were Saint Guillaume Repin and 98 other religious, many of whom were later beatified by the Catholic Church.John W.

First published in \\"Quadrant\\" magazine Australia, 1996) General Turreau inquired about \\"the fate of the women and children I will encounter in rebel territory\\", stating that, if it was \\"necessary to pass them all by sword\\", he would require a decree. In response, the Committee of Public Safety ordered him to \\"eliminate the brigands to the last man, there is your duty...\\" General Charette, in Nantes, March 1796, by Julien Le Blant, c. 1883 The Convention issued conciliatory proclamations allowing the Vendeans liberty of worship and guaranteeing their property. General Hoche applied these measures with great success. He restored their cattle to the peasants who submitted, \\"let the priests have a few crowns\\", and on 20 July 1795 annihilated an √©migr√© expedition which had been equipped in England and had seized Fort Penthi√®vre and Quiberon. Treaties were concluded at La Jaunaye (15 February 1795) and at La Mabillaie, and were fairly well observed by the Vendeans; no obstacle remained but the feeble and scattered remnant of the Vendeans still under arms and the Chouans. On 30 July 1796 the state of siege was raised in the western departments. Estimates of those killed in the Vendean conflict‚Äîon both sides‚Äîrange between 117,000 and 450,000, out of a population of around 800,000.'State and Counterrevolution in France' ‚Äì Charles Tilly.

Dodge,Napoleon by Theodore A. Dodge the war in the Vend√©e lasted with intensity from 1793 to 1799, when it was suppressed, but later broke out spasmodically especially in 1813, 1814 and 1815. During Napoleon's Hundred Days in 1815, some of the population of the Vend√©e remained loyal to Louis XVIII, forcing Napoleon‚Äîwho was short of troops to fight the Waterloo Campaign‚Äîto send a force of 10,000 under the command of Jean Maximilien Lamarque to pacify the 8,000 Vendeans led by Pierre Constant Suzannet in the Battle of Rocheservi√®re. Genocide controversy Soldiers, women, and children embroiled in a fight near a church The popular historiography of the War in the Vend√©e is deeply rooted in conflicts between different schools of French historiography, and, as a result, writings on the uprising are generally highly partisan, coming down strongly in support of the revolutionary government or the Vend√©en royalists.Jean-Cl√©ment Martin, La Vend√©e et la R√©volution. Accepter la m√©moire pour √©crire l'histoire, Perrin, collection Tempus, 2007, pp. 68‚Äì69 This conflict originated in the 19th century between two groups of historians, the Bleus, named for their support of the republicans, who based their findings on archives from the uprising and the Blancs, named for their support of the monarchy and the Catholic Church, who based their findings on local oral histories.Jean-Cl√©ment Martin, La Vend√©e et la R√©volution. Accepter la m√©moire pour √©crire l'histoire, Perrin, collection Tempus, 2007, pp. 70‚Äì71 The Bleus generally argued that the Vend√©e was not a popular uprising, but was the result of noble and clerical manipulation of the peasantry. One of the leaders of this school of thought, Charles-Louis Chassin, published eleven volumes of letters, archives, and other materials supporting this position. The Blancs, generally members of the former nobility and clergy themselves, argued (frequently using the same documents as Chassin, but also drawing from contemporary memoirs and oral histories) that the peasants were acting out of a genuine love for the nobility and a desire to protect the Catholic Church. This focus was popularized in the English-speaking world in 1986, with French historian Reynald Secher's A French Genocide: The Vend√©e. Secher argued that the actions of the French republican government during the War in the Vend√©e was the first modern genocide.Secher, Reynald. A French Genocide: The Vend√©e, University of Notre Dame Press, (2003), . Secher's claims caused a minor uproar in France amongst scholars of modern French history, as many mainstream authorities on the period‚Äîboth French and foreign‚Äîpublished articles rejecting Secher's claims.Stefan Berger, Mark Donovan, Kevin Passmore (dir.), Writing National Histories ‚Äì Western Europe Since 1800, Routledge, Londres, 1999, 247 pp., contribution by Julian Jackson.

Timothy Tackett of the University of California summarizes the case as such: \\"In reality ... the Vend√©e was a tragic civil war with endless horrors committed by both sides‚Äîinitiated, in fact, by the rebels themselves. The Vendeans were no more blameless than were the republicans. The use of the word genocide is wholly inaccurate and inappropriate.\\"Voir l'intervention de Timothy Tackett, dans French Historical Studies, Autumn 2001, p. 572. Hugh Gough (Professor of history at University College Dublin) called Secher's book an attempt at historical revisionism unlikely to have any lasting impact.Hugh Gough, \\"Genocide & the Bicentenary: the French Revolution and the revenge of the Vend√©e\\", (Historical Journal, vol. 30, 4, 1987, pp. 977‚Äì88.) p. 987. While some such as Peter McPhee roundly criticized Secher, including the assertion of commonality between the functions of the Republican government and Communist totalitarianism, historian Pierre Chaunu expressed support for Secher's views,Daileader, Philip and Philip Whalen, French Historians 1900‚Äì2000: New Historical Writing in Twentieth-Century France, pp. 105, 107, Wiley 2010 describing the events as the first \\"ideological genocide\\".Levene, Mark, Genocide in the Age of the Nation State: The rise of the West and the coming of Genocide, p. 118, I.B. Tauris 2005 Shootings and massacres by the Colonnes infernales under Turreau Critics of Secher's thesis have alleged that his methodology is flawed. McPhee asserted that these errors are as follows: (1) The war was not fought against Vendeans but Royalist Vendeans, the government relied on the support of Republican Vendeans; (2) the Convention ended the campaign after the Royalist Army was clearly defeated‚Äîif the aim was genocide, then they would have continued and easily exterminated the population; (3) Fails to inform the reader of atrocities committed by Royalist against Republicans in the Vend√©e; (4) Repeats stories now known to be folkloric myths as fact; (5) Does not refer to the wide range of estimates of deaths suffered by both sides, and that casualties were not \\"one-sided\\"; and more. Drownings at Nantes Peter McPhee says that the pacification of the Vend√©e does not fit either the United Nations' CPPCG definition of genocide because the events happened during a civil war. He states that the war in the Vend√©e was not a one-sided mass killing and the Committee of Public Safety did not intend to exterminate the whole population of the Vend√©e; parts of the population were allied to the revolutionary government. Concerning the controversy, Michel Vovelle, a specialist on the French Revolution, remarked: \\"A whole literature is forming on \\"Franco-French genocide\\", starting from risky estimates of the number of fatalities in the Vendean wars ... Despite not being specialists in the subject, historians such as Pierre Chaunu have put all the weight of their great moral authority behind the development of an anathematizing discourse, and have dismissed any effort to look at the subject reasonably.\\" Debate over the characterization of the Vend√©e uprising was renewed in 2007, when nine deputies introduced a measure to the Assembl√©e nationale to officially recognize the republican actions as genocidal. The measure was strongly denounced by a group of leftist French historians as an attempt to use history to justify political extremism.\\"La proposition de loi sur \\"le g√©nocide vend√©en\\", une atteinte √† la libert√© du citoyen.\\", archival link: At the start of 2017 Jacques Villemain published Vend√©e, 1793‚Äì1794 : Crime de guerre ? Crime contre l'humanit√© ? G√©nocide ? Une √©tude juridique, which an analysis by him of the Vend√©e war from the perspective of the international courts of justice in The Hague (such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda). Jacques Villemain is a French diplomat, and is currently the vice representative of France at OECD and is representing France at the International Court of Justice. He presents a legal study on the War of Vend√©e based on current international law, then according modern findings in the international courts on genocide cases like the Rwanda Genocide, and the Srebrenica massacre, is that there were war crimes performed by The French Republic in March 1793, Crime against Humanity from April to July 1793 and Genocide from 1 August 1793 to middle of 1794. (Google Translate) =Challenging the methodology= In the heart of the modern controversy lies Secher's evidence, which Charles Tilly analyzed in 1990.Charles Tilly, \\"Chapter Three:State and Counterrevolution in France\\", found in Feh√©r, Ferenc, editor. The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990, pp. 49‚Äì63. Initially, Tilly maintains, Secher completed a thoughtful dissertation-style thesis about the revolutionary experience in his own village, La Chapelle-Basse-Mer, which lies near Nantes. In the published version of his thesis, he incorporated some of Tilly's own arguments: that conflicts within communities generalized into a region-wide confrontation of anti-revolutionary majority based in the countryside with a pro-revolutionary minority that had particular strength in the cities. The split formed with the application of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the oath to support it, in 1790‚Äì1792. From then, the local conflicts grew more sharply defined, over the choice between juring and non-juring priests. The conscription of March 1793, with the questionable exemption for Republican officials and National Guard members, broadened the anti-revolutionary coalition and brought the young men into action.Tilly, p. 60. With Le g√©nocide fran√ßais, Reynald Secher's thesis for the Doctorat d'√âtat began with a generalization of the standard arguments to the whole region. Although La Chapelle-Basse-Mer served him repeatedly as a reference point, Secher illustrated his arguments with wide citations from national and regional archives to establish a broader frame of reference. Furthermore, he drew on graphic, nineteenth century accounts widely known to the historians of the Vendee: Carrier drownings and the \\"infernal columns of Turreau\\". Most importantly, however, Secher broke with conventional assessments by asserting on the basis of minimal evidence, Tilly claims, that the pre-revolutionary Vend√©e was more prosperous than the rest of France (to better emphasize the devastation of the war and the repression). He used dubious statistical methods to establish population losses and fatalities, statistical processes that inflated the number of people in the region, the number and value of houses, and the financial losses of the region. Secher's statistical procedure relied on three unjustifiable assumptions. First, Secher assumes a constant birth rate of about 37 per thousand of population, when actually, Tilly maintains, the population was declining. Second, Secher assumes no net migration; Tilly maintains that thousands fled the region, or at least shifted where they lived within the region. Finally, Secher understated the population present at the end of the conflict by ending it 1802, not 1794.Tilly, pp. 61‚Äì63. Despite the criticism, a number of scholars continue the assertion of genocide. In addition to Secher and Chaunu, Kurt Jonassohn and Frank Chalk also consider it a case of genocide.Jonassohn, Kurt and Solveig Bjeornson, Karin. Genocide and Gross Human Rights Violations. 1998, Transaction Publishers, . p. 208. Further support comes from Adam Jones, who wrote in Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction a summary of the Vend√©e uprising, supporting the view that it was a genocide: \\"the Vend√©e Uprising stands as a notable example of a mass killing campaign that has only recently been conceptualized as 'genocide'\\" and that while this designation \\"is not universally shared ... it seems apt in the light of the large scale murder of a designated group (the Vend√©an civilian population).\\"Jones, Adam.

The French Revolution and the Birth of > Modernity. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990, p. 62. The Vend√©e revolt became an immediate symbol of confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution, and a source of unexpurgated violence. The region, and its towns, were eliminated; even the department name of Vend√©e was renamed Venge. Towns and cities were also renamed, but at heart, in villages and farms, the old names remained the same. Beyond the controversial interpretations of genocide, other historians posit the insurrection as a revolt against conscription that cascaded to include other complaints. For a period of several months, control of the Vend√©e slipped from the hands of Parisian revolutionaries. They ascribed the revolt to the resurgence of royalist ideas: when faced with insurrection of the people against the Revolution of the People, they were unable to see it as anything but an aristocratic plot. Mona Ozouf and Fran√ßois Furet maintain it was not. The entire territory, none of it unified under a single idea from the ancien regime, had never been a region morally at odds with the rest of the nation. It was not the fall of the old regime that aroused the population against the Revolution, but rather the construction of the new regime into locally unacceptable principles and forms: the new map of districts and departments, the administrative dictatorship, and above all the non-juring priests. Rebellion had first flared in August 1792, but had been immediately quelled. Even the regicide did not trigger insurrection. What did was the forced conscription. Although the Vendeans, to use the term loosely, wrote God and King large on their flags, they invested those symbols of their tradition with something other than regret for the lost regime.Furet and Ozouf, p. 166. Film Filmed on location in France, The Hidden Rebellion, a docu-drama produced and directed by Daniel Rabourdin, presents the rebellion as an example of the courage and love for God and country that the royalist peasants possessed. The Hidden Rebellion, winner of the 2017 Remi film award, has aired on EWTN and is available for purchase on DVD. The uprising in the Vend√©e was also the subject of an independent feature film from Navis Pictures. The War of the Vend√©e (2012), written and directed by Jim Morlino, won awards for \\"Best Film For Young Audiences\\" (Mirabile Dictu International Catholic Film Festival, at the Vatican) and \\"Best Director\\" (John Paul II International Film Festival, Miami, FL). The Vend√©e Revolt was the setting for one of the BBC's The Scarlet Pimpernel (TV series) series entitled \\"Valentine Gautier\\" (2002). The Vend√©e Revolt was also the setting for \\"The Frogs and the Lobsters\\", an episode of the television program Hornblower. It is set during the French Revolutionary Wars and very loosely based on the chapter of the same name in C. S. Forester's novel, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and on the actual ill-fated Quiberon expedition of 1795.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba between 1958 and 1962, and ran for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1961. He was later involved with the Liberal Party of Canada, and was a founding member of the Reform Party of Canada. Early years Roberts was born in St. Adolphe, Manitoba, later farming there, and received of Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba and an MBA from Western University. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1958, as a Liberal-Progressive candidate in the francophone riding of La Verendrye (Roberts was himself bilingual). Although Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservative (PC) Party won the general election, Roberts defeated his Tory opponent Stan Bisson by 1565 votes to 1395. He was re-elected in 1959, defeating PC candidate Edmond Guertin. When Douglas Campbell resigned as Liberal-Progressive leader in 1961, Roberts ran to succeed him. He represented a \\"left opposition\\" within the party, and accused its more conservative leadership of being ineffective against Roblin's centrist/progressive government. He was defeated by establishment candidate Gildas Molgat by 475 votes to 279 on April 20, 1961, one day after the party formally renamed itself the Manitoba Liberal Party. Resignation Roberts resigned from the legislature to contest the 1962 federal election in the riding of Provencher; he was defeated by Progressive Conservative Warner Jorgenson by about a thousand votes. He again lost to Jorgenson in the 1963 federal election, by a slightly greater margin. Roberts subsequently worked as a Manitoba advisor to Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, and served as president and acting leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1969 to 1970 (after party leader Robert Bend failed to win his seat in the 1969 provincial election). He also worked as an executive officer for McCabe Grain Company Limited, later National Grain Company Limited. In 1971, he was named vice-president of Simon Fraser University, serving until 1976. Constitutional reform involvement In 1976, Roberts became the first president of the Canada West Foundation. In this capacity, he took a leading role in arguing for the position of the west in Canada's constitutional debates. He also developed contacts with Ernest and Preston Manning. In late 1978, Roberts expressed interest in Francis Winspear's proposed constitutional reforms, which included Senate reform and the equal treatment of all provinces. During this period, Roberts made several speeches warning about the possibility of western separatism. There were some within the Canada West Foundation who believed that Roberts himself was partly sympathetic to separatism; he never became affiliated with the movement, but was forced to step down as CWF President in December 1980 after some controversial statements on the subject. In 1980, he moved from British Columbia to Toronto after being named president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. Roberts left that position in 1982. Roberts remained loyal to the Liberal Party during this period. He ran for the leadership of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1984, but lost to former Member of Parliament Art Lee on the first ballot. Roberts's participation in this contest probably prevented him from running to succeed Pierre Trudeau as leader of the federal party. Roberts disagreed with the selection of John Turner as party leader, but he nevertheless ran for the federal Liberals in the Quebec riding of Lachine in 1984, losing to Progressive Conservative Bob Layton. Reform Party of Canada After this election, Roberts began to consider forming a new political party. The federal Liberal Party had long been weak in western Canada, and won only two seats west of Ontario in 1984. Roberts believed that a new party might be necessary to oppose Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in western Canada. In 1987, he became involved with Francis Winspear, Preston Manning and Ted Byfield in plans to create what would later become the Reform Party of Canada. Roberts was in many respects an unlikely figure within this group. His political philosophy was centrist, perhaps somewhat left-of-centre. He was not an uncritical supporter of free- market economics, and he does not seem to have been a social conservative. Nevertheless, he was willing to work with more conservative figures to create the new party. Even before the Reform Party's founding convention (October 30-November 1, 1987), Roberts began to have concerns about the new party's ideology. He opposed its regionalist aspects, and was concerned by its popularity with voters who opposed bilingualism and Quebec's role in Canada's Confederation. One week before the founding convention, he agreed to stand for the party's leadership against Preston Manning, the only other declared candidate. At the convention, Manning's supporters among the convention-goers voted to close the registration process one day ahead of schedule, perhaps fearing Roberts was planning to bus in several \\"instant delegates\\". After failed negotiations with the Manning camp, Roberts dropped out of the race on November 1, claiming that Manning's supporters had hijacked the party from its original intentions. He referred to Manning's supporters as \\"fanatical Albertans\\" and \\"small-minded evangelical cranks\\". Roberts subsequently sought the Reform Party's nomination in the British Columbia riding of Saanich‚ÄîGulf Islands for the 1988 federal election, but was defeated. He had no further involvement with the Reform Party, and died of a brain tumour in Burnaby two years later.

The game was created by Rick Priestley and sold by the Games Workshop company. As in other miniature wargames, players use miniature models (minis) to represent warriors. The playing field is a model battlefield comprising models of buildings, trees, hills, and other terrain features. Players take turns moving their model warriors across the battlefield and pretend that their models are fighting each other. The outcomes of fights between the models are determined by a combination of dice rolls and simple arithmetic. Though the gameplay is mostly based on medieval warfare, it incorporates fantasy elements such as wizards, dragons, and magical spells. Warhammer was the first commercial miniature wargame designed to use proprietary models. Prior to this, miniature wargames rulesets were designed to use generic models that could be bought from any manufacturer. The first edition rulebook for Warhammer was released in 1982, and the line was supported for thirty years by model releases, supplementary rulebooks, and new editions of the core rules. The eighth and final edition of the core rules was released on 10 July 2010. The game is no longer supported by Games Workshop, and the last supplementary rulebook was released in 2015. It was replaced later that year by Warhammer Age of Sigmar, which uses the models created for the Warhammer line in a new setting and game system. The Warhammer setting is inspired by the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock. The fictional background for the game was developed in rulebooks, White Dwarf magazine, Inferno! magazine, and more than 150 novels set in the Warhammer universe. Many of these novels are still in print under the Warhammer Chronicles imprint.  Gameplay  Warhammer is a tabletop wargame where two or more players compete against each other with \\"armies\\" of 25 mm ‚Äì 250 mm tall heroic miniatures. The rules of the game have been published in a series of books which describe how to move miniatures around the game surface and simulate combat in a \\"balanced and fair\\" manner. Games may be played on any appropriate surface, although the standard is a 6 ft by 4 ft tabletop decorated with model scenery in scale with the miniatures. Any individual miniature or group of similar miniatures in the game is called a \\"unit\\". The core game rules are supplied in a single book, with supplemental Warhammer Armies texts giving guidelines and background for army-specific rules. Movement of units about the playing surface is generally measured in inches, and units' combat performance is dictated randomly by either the roll of a 6-sided die (a 'D6') or a 6-sided 'scatter' die. The latter is often used to generate direction, commonly alongside an 'artillery' die, for cannons, stone-throwers, and other artillery. Each unit and option within the game is assigned a point value for balancing purposes. A game will commonly have armies of 750 to 3,000 points, although smaller and larger values are possible. The Warhammer world Warhammer is set in a fictional universe notable for its \\"dark and gritty\\" background world, which features influences from Michael Moorcock's Elric stories, and also many historical influences. The geography of the Warhammer world closely resembles that of Earth because of manipulation by an ancient spacefaring race known as the Old Ones. This mysterious and powerful race visited the Warhammer World in the distant past. Establishing an outpost, they set about manipulating the geography and biosphere of the planet. With the assistance of their Slann servants, they moved the planet's orbit closer to its sun, and arranged the continents to their liking. To travel between worlds, the Old Ones used portals to another dimension (\\"warp gates\\"), which they built at the north and south poles of the Warhammer World. Eventually, however, these gates collapsed, allowing raw magical energy and the daemonic forces of Chaos to pour forth into the Warhammer world. At this point, the Old Ones disappeared. Before leaving however, they had established the Lizard men (ruled over by the Slann) as their servants. In addition they had created the races of Elves, Dwarfs, Humans, Ogres and Halflings. Orcs and Goblins were not created by the Old Ones, or part of their plan, and their origin is not made clear in the setting. Beastmen and Skaven were the result of mutation from raw magical energy at this time. Eventually the Chaos Daemons were driven back by Lizardmen and Elves, with the Elves performing a great ritual to drain out the raw magic that was flowing into the world and sustaining the Daemons. Some creatures, such as Dragons and Dragon-Ogres, are stated to have existed prior to the arrival of the Old Ones. After this, Elves and Dwarfs flourished and created mighty empires, but eventually they were set into a slow decline. A series of civil wars amongst the Elves split them into two groups ‚Äì the malicious Dark Elves and righteous High Elves. A petty war between the High Elves and Dwarfs served only to diminish both races and caused the High Elves to abandon their colonies. Some of the colonists refused to leave their homes in a magical sapient forest and over time developed into the enigmatic and isolationist Wood Elves. A period of seismic activity caused by the Slann decimated the underground holds of the Dwarfs while attacks by Skaven and Goblins, who breached the Dwarf strongholds from below, only made things more desperate. The humans were the slowest to develop, but ultimately formed several strong nations able to defend themselves from aggressors. The Nehekharan Empire (based on Ancient Egypt) was the first great human empire, but due to a curse by Nagash (the first necromancer) they became an undead faction known as the \\"Tomb Kings\\" who now dwell in The Land of the Dead (former Nehekhara). Nagash, in his efforts to find eternal life, also created the first Vampires, an entirely separate undead faction. In the present time (according to the setting's fictional timeline) there are two prominent human nations: The Empire which is based on a combination of aspects of the Holy Roman Empire and Renaissance Germany, and Bretonnia, which is based on Arthurian legends and medieval France. Sigmar, founder of The Empire, wielded a mighty Dwarf-made Warhammer from which the name of the \\"Warhammer Fantasy\\" setting is derived. There are also numerous other nations which are fleshed out in the background information but are not represented by playable factions in the tabletop game, some of which are loosely based on real-world nations from various historical periods; examples being Estalia and Tilea which reflect medieval Spain and the Roman Empire, or Cathay to the far East that is analogous to a fantastic version of Imperial China. The forces of disorder are often depicted as not a localised threat, but a general menace consisting of disparate factions, many of which are typically also at odds with each other. The Skaven exist in an \\"Under Empire\\" (an extensive network of tunnels beneath the planet's surface), while the war-loving Orcs and Goblins are nomadic (although they are most common in the Badlands, Southlands and Dark Lands) and regularly amass large numbers and stage raids without warning. Similarly, Ogres are most common in the Ogre Kingdoms and in the eastern Mountains of Mourn, but are depicted as unscrupulous wandering warriors who are always hungry, who sometimes hire themselves out as mercenaries to both the forces of order and disorder. In addition to the chaos-worshiping Warriors of Chaos who live in strange Chaos Wastes north of the other faction's lands, chaos cults often arise within human and elven nations. Beastmen are depicted as mutants dwelling deep in forests and impossible to fully eradicate. Vampires and necromancers raising armies of undead are also depicted often as an internal threat. Chaos Daemons are restricted to manifesting themselves where magical energy is strongest, but this could be almost anywhere. The 8th Edition Empire Army Book describes the Warhammer World to currently be in the year 2522 (Empire calendar), whilst the current Lizardmen Army Book puts the collapse of the warpgates at ‚àí5700 on the same calendar, thus the fictional history spans at least 8200 years.  Armies  There are a number of playable armies for Warhammer, which are representative of one or other of the factions or races that are present in the Warhammer world setting. For the first few editions of the game armies were presented in collective books like Warhammer Armies. Starting in the 4th edition individual books were released for each army. In the 8th edition of the game, the following armies had individual army books: *Beastmen *Bretonnia *Daemons of Chaos *Dark Elves *Dwarfs *The Empire *High Elves *Lizardmen *Ogre Kingdoms *Orcs and Goblins *Skaven *Tomb Kings *Vampire Counts *Warriors of Chaos *Wood Elves During the 6th edition, the following armies had official rules available from the Games Workshop website, and were usable throughout the 6th and 7th editions. These rules have since been taken down, and they were unplayable in the 8th edition. *Chaos Dwarfs: The White Dwarf Presents army book was released during the 4th Edition as a collection of White Dwarf articles, but is still considered an official rule book. An official Chaos Dwarf army list was included in Ravening Hordes at the start of the 6th edition. The army list was included in the reference section of the 7th edition, but has been removed from the 8th edition rulebook. This model line was discontinued at the end of the 5th edition and is no longer supported by the main rules. Forge World released Chaos Dwarf models under their Warhammer Forge line. *Dogs of War: The official army book was released during the 5th Edition; Regiments of Renown and Mercenary Army lists for the 6th edition were released on the website. Regardless, some of this line remained available for direct order from Games Workshop as late as 2013. *Kislev: The army book was given away free with White Dwarf magazine during the 6th edition. This model line has since been discontinued and is no longer supported. Armies that were left unsupported prior to the 6th edition: *Fimir  Magical Lores  The eight main Lores of the Warhammer world are used by multiple armies and races, and are the only Lores available to Empire and Bretonnian armies. Dwarves do not use magic at all. *Lore of Light *Lore of Metal *Lore of Death *Lore of Life *Lore of Heaven *Lore of Shadow *Lore of Fire *Lore of Beasts While at least some of the eight main lores can be used by many armies of the Warhammer world many races have their own unique magical Lores. *Lore of High Magic (High Elves, Wood Elves and Lizardmen) *Lore of Dark Magic (Dark Elves and Wood Elves) *Lore of the Little WAAAGH (Goblins) *Lore of the Big WAAAGH (Orcs) *Skaven Spells of Ruin (Skaven) *Skaven Spells of Plague (Skaven) *Lore of the Wild (Beastmen) *Lore of Nurgle (Warriors of Chaos and Daemons of Chaos) *Lore of Slaanesh (Warriors of Chaos and Daemons of Chaos) *Lore of Tzeentch (Warriors of Chaos and Daemons of Chaos) *The Lore of the Vampires (Vampire Counts) *The Lore of Nehekhara (Tomb Kings) *Lore of the Great Maw (Ogre Kingdoms) Former Lores: *Lore of Athel Loren (Wood Elves) *Lore of Ice (Kislev) Editions Throughout the eight editions of the game, the core movement, combat and shooting systems remained generally unchanged, with only minor revisions between editions. The most significant changes which ensure incompatibility between editions have been made to the magic, army composition systems, and specialist troop types. The starter armies in the box sets have grew more detailed with each succeeding generation, and the 7th edition (2006) was the first to be titled as a scenario (\\"The Battle for Skull Pass\\") instead of just Warhammer Fantasy Battle. For example, the High Elves have appeared in the 4th edition (1992) and the 8th edition (2010); while the 4th edition only contained Spearmen and Bowmen figures (essentially, just two types of figurines) plus a cardboard cutout for the general, the 8th edition contained a more widely varied army (including cavalry, Sword Masters, mage, and a general mounted on a griffon). =Inspiration= Published in November 1981 for its second edition (1978 for the very first one), and written by Richard Halliwell and Rick Priestley, Reaper is considered the ancestor of Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Reaper is more a skirmish game for up to 30 miniatures rather than a large-scale wargame. =First edition (1983)= The first edition, written by Bryan Ansell, Richard Halliwell and Rick Priestley was published in 1983 as Warhammer The Mass Combat Fantasy Role-Playing Game and consists of a boxed set of 3 black and white books illustrated by Tony Ackland: Vol 1: Tabletop Battles, which contains the core rules, turn sequence, creature lists, potion recipes and features an introductory battle 'The Ziggurat of Doom'. Vol 2: Magic which explains rules for wizards of 4 different levels and the higher order arch magi. Higher level wizards have access to more powerful spells. In this system, a wizard picks his spells at the start of the game, must have the correct equipment (usually Amulets), and as he casts each one it depletes a store of 'constitution' points, until at zero points he could cast no more. Vol 3: Characters introduces 'personal characteristics' statistics, rules for roleplaying (including character advancement through experience points and statistic gains, random encounters, equipment costs, and alignment) and has a sample campaign \\"The Redwake River Valley\\". Very little world background is given at all and the race descriptions are kept to a minimum, and most of the background given is in describing the origins of magic items. Some notable differences to later editions are the inclusion of Night Elves (later Dark Elves), the appearance of Red Goblins ‚Äì and that Citadel Miniatures order codes are given. Critical reaction In the July 1983 edition of White Dwarf, (Issue 43), Joe Dever gave the system a positive review, saying, \\"If you regularly wargame with miniatures, or have been wondering what additional fun you could have from your rapidly growing collection of fantasy figures, then I recommend you check out Warhammer and let battle commence!\\" Chris Hunter reviewed Warhammer for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"if you are looking for a mass fantasy combat system, I would recommend Warhammer; but if all you want is a fantasy role-playing game, it would perhaps be better to look elsewhere\\". In the May 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue 85), Katherine Kerr was not impressed, and called it \\"one of the most irritating new games I‚Äôve ever read.\\" She found the manuscript full of typographical errors, and \\"On top of it all, the authors have a miserable command of the English language. Their prose is even more awkward than the usual low level of gaming writing and is studded with grammatical errors.\\" She found the game system divided between a good combat system and a poor roleplaying system, and called the effort \\"two separate games with a weak attempt to link them together. The first, a set of rules for tabletop battles with miniature figures, is very good; the second, pieces of a fantasy role-playing game, is embarrassingly bad.\\" In the same issue, Ken Rolston also reviewed Warhammer, and although he agreed that the rules were \\"hardly a model of English usage or proofreading,\\" they were well-organised and readable. Rolston agreed with Kerr that the miniatures rules were the strong suit of the system, but he also admired the psychology rules that determined how classic fantasy racial types behave towards each other. However, he found the role-playing system to be \\"primitive\\". In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 72), Edwin J. Rotondaro also thought the system was divided between good miniatures rules and bad roleplaying rules. \\"Overall, I have to say that Warhammer is a good miniatures game, but a terrible roleplaying game. The system is flexible enough to be used as a mass combat module in most RPGs, but you have to decide whether it's worth [the price] for a set of fantasy miniatures rules.\\"  Expansion  The first edition was extended with Forces of Fantasy boxed set in 1984. =Second edition (1984)= The second edition split the rules into three rulebooks ‚Äî Combat, Battle Magic and Battle Bestiary, with full-colour artwork by John Blanche. There were few substantive changes in rules, but major clarifications of the original rules were included. New rules included uses and effects of standards and musicians, flying, fortifications, fire, artillery, chariots, reserve units, specialist spellcasters, and poisons. This edition also further developed \\"The Known World\\", which was geographically and socially based upon Earth. Critical reaction In the June 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #66), Robert Alcock called the second edition \\"a predictable expansion of the original\\", although he noted that this edition had \\"not ironed out all the problems.\\" Alcock especially disliked the mechanic of \\"throwing a bucket full of dice to cause casualties and then find that your opponent gets most of them back with a saving throw.\\" However, despite these issues, Alcock concluded that \\"Warhammer does remain the only viable set of fantasy mass battle rules\\", and gave the second edition an overall rating of 8 out of 10. =Third edition (1987)= The Third Edition of the game was published as a single hardback book in 1987. It had the most in-depth and complex movement and manoeuvre system of any edition. Other changes included a variety of new specialist troop types, rules for war machines and a more finely tuned system of representing heroes and wizards. It kept the same magic system and open-ended army design system as the first two editions. However, by this stage the use of army lists was very much encouraged. Army lists for this edition were published in a separate book called Warhammer Armies in 1988; until then, use of the 2nd Edition's Ravening Hordes list was encouraged. This is partly because it was the last edition published before Games Workshop took a different commercial approach, leading to competition from former GW employees in the briefly published competing Fantasy Warlord. The third edition was expanded with the Realm of Chaos: tome one, Slaves To Darkness, followed by tome two, The Lost and the Damned; and Warhammer Siege books. Critical reaction In the February 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue 142), Ken Rolston gave the third edition high praise, saying, \\"If you‚Äôre serious about fantasy tabletop gaming, Warhammer Fantasy Battle (WFB) is probably your only choice. Rolston liked the \\"fast-paced\\" rules system and developed fantasy background, and his only reservations were about presentation: \\"The text is dense and wordy. The wealth of diagrams is good, but their captions aren‚Äôt always clear. The abundance of photos, illustrations, and paintings is often visually stimulating, but many of these graphics are of marginal or negligible relevance to the accompanying text. The black-and-white photographic reproduction is surprisingly poor.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation: \\"The fantasy campaign setting is simply super. The series of revised editions, supplements, and magazine support articles indicates that Games Workshop is interested in and capable of catering to the gamer‚Äôs appetite for new features, refined editions, and elaborated fantasy campaign materials.\\" Reviews *Challenge #37 (1989) =4th edition (1992) and 5th edition (1996)= The fourth and fifth editions of the game, released in October 1992 and October 1996, respectively, were similar to each other but quite different from the third. The fifth edition in particular became known pejoratively as \\"Herohammer\\" because of the imbalance between the very powerful heroes, monsters and wizards in the game and blocks of troops which existed effectively as cannon fodder. Both editions of the game were sold as box sets containing not only the rulebooks and a variety of other play aids but also sufficient plastic miniatures to be able to play the game \\"out of the box\\". The rules underwent a re-write compared to the 3rd Edition. A completely re-worked magic system was produced which was available as a boxed expansion set. Rather than selecting spells they were drawn at random and the magic phase was based on the play of these cards, making magic a bit like a game within a game. The magic system was further expanded by the Arcane Magic box set and the magic element of the Chaos box set. The fourth edition was also the first edition to enforce the use of army lists in the form of separate Warhammer Army books for the separate racial groupings. These books prescribed for each army a limited number of unit choices; specifying limits on the number of points that could be spent on \\"characters\\", troops and monsters and so on. The books also included background on the particular army, illustrations and photographs showing models and have remained with the game though updated with the rules. The magic system was reworked and re-released in December 1996 as a single box covering the magic for all the armies. The magic was \\"toned down\\" (WD204) with spell casting limited to the players' own turn. The multiple card packs of the Colours of Magic system was replaced by 20 Battle Magic spell cards but the Colour Magic spells were in the rule book for players to use if they wanted. Several boxed campaign packs were produced, Tears of Isha for example, gave a campaign for High Elves and included a card \\"building\\" to assemble. Likewise, the Orc and Goblin themed campaign Idol of Gork included card idols of the Orc deities Gork and Mork. The others were Circle of Blood (Vampire Counts vs Bretonnians), Grudge of Drong (Dwarves vs High Elves) and Perilous Quest (Bretonnians vs Wood Elves). The fourth edition featured High Elves versus Goblins. The fifth edition, released in 1996, re- introduced the Bretonnian forces, which had been left out of the 4th edition, and re-worked the Slann heavily to create the Lizardmen armies. In 1997, the fifth edition of Warhammer Fantasy Battles won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Miniatures Rules of 1996. = 6th edition (2000) = The sixth edition, released in 2000, was also published as a box with soft-cover rulebook and miniatures (Orcs and Empire). The Rulebook was also available for separate sale, hard-cover in the first printing and soft-cover after that. After the fifth edition, this edition put the emphasis back on troop movement and combat: heroes and wizards were still important but became incapable of winning games in their own right. There was also an all-new magic system based on dice rolling. = 7th edition (2006) = The seventh edition rules were released on 9 September 2006. It was available in two forms: as a single hardback rulebook for established gamers and as a complete boxed set game complete with plastic miniatures (Dwarfs and Goblins), The Battle for Skull Pass supplement book and a soft-cover rulebook that has less artwork and background material than the hardback version. The smaller rulebook from the boxed set was approximately half the size of the large book both in size of the cover and page count. The \\"Basic Rules\\" and \\"Advanced Rules\\" sections of both books were identical in text, layout, illustrations, credits, page numbering and ISBN. The two books had different front pieces and the larger rulebook has two extensive addition sections \\"The Warhammer World\\" (68 pages) and \\"The Warhammer Hobby\\" (56 pages) plus slightly expanded appendices. =8th edition (2010)= According to the official Games Workshop webpage, the 8th edition of Warhammer was made available for pre-order on 14 June 2010 and was released 10 July 2010. The new starter set named Island of Blood contains facing armies of High Elves and Skaven. A condensed mini-rulebook, as well as 10 standard dice, one scatter and one artillery die, two 18 inch rulers, and three blast templates are included in the box. On Friday 23 July 2010, Games Workshop began posting an \\"unboxed\\" series detailing the contents of the new game box called \\"A Blog of Two Gamers\\" The first army to be introduced to the 8th edition was Orcs and Goblins. They are one of the most popular Warhammer Fantasy armies, but their release in the 8th edition was not totally expected, as at the time there were four (Dwarfs, Wood Elves, Tomb Kings and Bretonnia) Warhammer army books which had not been updated since the 6th edition. The Dwarf, Wood Elf and Tomb Kings army books have since been replaced with newer versions. The Skaven and bretonnians armybook however, still has not been updated since the 7th edition.  8th edition's Expansion (2011)  The 8th edition was extended with Storm of Magic 'supplement' in 2011 (an expansion that features rules for using more destructive magic and monsters). Another one was released, called Blood in the Badlands shortly afterwards (it included some special scenarios and introduced rules for siege warfare). In 2013 Triumph and Treachery (an expansion that allows multi-player games of between 3 and 5 players) and Sigmar's Blood (a 5 scenario short campaign between Empire and Vampire Counts following the crusade led by Volkmar to destroy Mannfred von Carstein) were released. Another series of five books in 2014‚Äì15, entitled The End Times, saw the appearance of every major character of the setting. The last book Archaon described the end of the Warhammer world.  Future  In 2019 it was announced that Games Workshop is working on Warhammer: The Old World, a new wargaming line using the Warhammer setting. The released map suggest that it takes place in the past of the setting. Concept art featuring units for Kislev has been released. Development is expected to take three or more years, so it is not expected to be released before 2022.  Derivative games  Games based on the core Warhammer mechanics and rules include: *Warhammer Ancient Battles (often referred to as \\"WAB\\" and sometimes Warhammer Historical). Intended to simulate armies of the real world of the Ancient and Medieval periods. *A science fiction based skirmish wargame using similar rules was developed as Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader by Games Workshop and released in 1987. Originally using a minor variation of the 2nd edition Warhammer Fantasy Battle rules, the two games have subsequently taken different development paths. This has since developed into the separate Warhammer 40,000 setting. *The first edition of Blood Bowl uses the same basic turn system and character statistics as Warhammer to simulate a fantasy American football game. Rules for ranged combat applied to ball throwing. Since the second edition of Blood Bowl the game has taken its own development path. A card game inspired by the game has also been developed. *Games Workshop released a skirmish scale wargame set in the world of Warhammer called Mordheim. It is set in the destroyed city of Mordheim. It uses the same basic rules as the 5th edition of Warhammer, but modified to support activation of individual models in a small gang. It also has a campaign system which you use to improve your warband as they gain experience. *The Warhammer Fantasy Battles rules led to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay in 1986, again using the same statistics, although presented as percentiles rather than 1‚Äì10 to give more detail and differentiation between characters than is required in a wargame. In 2005 Black Industries released a second edition and Fantasy Flight Games now owns the rights to the 2nd edition game. In 2009 Fantasy Flight Games discontinued active support for the second edition due to the release of the 3rd edition. *Dark Heresy (another Role- playing game) was released by Black Industries in 2008 using a variation of the 2nd edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. The line was transferred to Fantasy Flight Games, which then released Rogue Trader (2009), Deathwatch (2010), Black Crusade (2011), and Only War (2013), each using close variants of the Dark Heresy engine. *Games Workshop release Judge Dredd: The Role- Playing Game (1985) was clearly derived from the same percentile mechanics as Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. *Inquisitor is a detailed, percentage based miniatures game set in the derivative Warhammer 40K setting. The mechanics fall somewhere between Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 1E and Warhammer 40K. Games based on the Warhammer setting, but not sharing the rules, include: *Warmaster, representing very large-scale, epic battles. Warmaster uses smaller models than Warhammer using 10 mm as opposed to 28 mm, with different rules regarding troop movement and combat. *In 1987, GW released a board game Chaos Marauders *In 1989, GW released another board game, Advanced HeroQuest *In 1993, Games Workshop released a naval wargame set in the world of Warhammer called Man O' War. *In 1990, Games Workshop released a strategic wargame of empire building, Mighty Empires, intended both as a stand-alone game and as a way to manage a campaign of miniature battles. This was followed in 1991 by Dragon Masters, an introductory game reusing some Mighty Empires assets in which players take the role of competing Elven princes in Ulthuan. *In 1995 the boardgame Warhammer Quest was released. Based upon the Warhammer Fantasy Battle system it shared many of the same combat mechanics as well as the setting, while building upon the previous game Advanced Heroquest. Warhammer Quest was followed by two expansions, Lair of the Orc Lord and Catacombs of Terror, nine Character Packs and several Card Packs. *Warhammer Fantasy Battle has been adapted as computer games: the 1995 Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat, its 1998 sequel Warhammer: Dark Omen, Warhammer: Mark of Chaos and the MMORPG, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning which was released on 18 September 2008. *Chaos in the Old World has been released (2009) *On 1 October 2011, Games Workshop released the one-off game, Dreadfleet. *Fantasy Flight Games' Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd edition is a new game engine not derived from the earlier game mechanics. It was released in 2009. *Warhammer Quest card game has been released (2015) *Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a first person shooter video game developed and published by Fatshark that was released on 23 October 2015. A sequel titled Warhammer: Vermintide 2 was released on 8 March 2018. *Total War: Warhammer is a turn-based strategy real- time tactics video game developed by the Creative Assembly and published by Sega that was released on 24 May 2016. It was followed by a sequel that was released on 28 September 2017.

Personal life Broccoli was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of the James Bond producer Albert R. \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli and actress Dana Wilson Broccoli (born Dana Natol). In 1995, Cubby Broccoli handed over control of Eon Productions, the production company responsible for the James Bond series of films, to Barbara and her half-brother Michael G. Wilson; they continue to run the company as of 2020. Barbara became President of the National Youth TheatreNational Youth Theatre after the success of their 60th Anniversary Diamond Gala at Shaftesbury Theatre in 2016. Broccoli married and divorced director and film producer Frederick M. Zollo. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2008 New Year Honours. In 2014 she was selected as a member of the jury for the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Broccoli attended Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she studied motion picture and television communications. Career =James Bond franchise= Broccoli started in the Bond franchise at the age of 17, working in the publicity department of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Several years later, she served as an assistant director on Octopussy (1983). Soon afterward, she progressed to become an associate producer of the film The Living Daylights (1987). However, her most significant role has been as a producer of the Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan and later Daniel Craig. =Chitty Chitty Bang Bang= Following her father's death in 1996, Broccoli worked with London theatre producer Michael Rose, to create the stage musical version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang based on the 1968 musical film starring Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes. Broccoli rehired the original songwriters from the film to write the new material for the stage version. The Sherman Brothers wrote five new songs for the show which debuted on April 16, 2002. The show ran at the London Palladium and was the most financially successful show to have ever played there, breaking numerous other impressive records. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang later transferred to Broadway, but was considered a failure, receiving poor reviews and playing just 319 performances, closing with the loss of a large proportion of the initial $15m investment.

The Farfisa brand name is commonly associated with a series of compact electronic organs and later, a series of multi-timbral synthesizers. Today, the Farfisa brand mainly produces intercom systems with the company ACI Farfisa which makes and distributes systems for video intercoms, access control, video surveillance, and home automation. The Bontempi group owns the keyboard division Farfisa brand name. At the height of its production, Farfisa operated three factories to produce instruments in Camerano in the Marche region of Italy. Farfisa also made radios, televisions, and other electronic items. The Farfisa brand name is an acronym for \\"FAbbriche Riunite di FISArmoniche\\", which translates to \\"united factories of accordions\\". History =Production= Farfisa made in Ancona, Italy Farfisa began manufacturing electric organs in 1964. Distribution in the U.S. was handled by the Chicago Musical Instrument Company, which also owned Gibson, and the instruments were originally known as CMI organs when introduced there. Unlike combo organs such as the Vox Continental, Farfisa organs have integrated legs, which can be folded up and stored inside its base. The first models produced were the Compact series of organs between 1964 and 1968. The line of FAST (Farfisa All-Silicon Transistorized) organs was launched at the 1968 NAMM show, and production of the Professional series appeared around the same time. Production of combo organs ended in the late 1970s after synthesizers had become more commonplace. =1960s= One of the first rock organists to play and spotlight the Farfisa was Domingo Samudio, known as \\"Sam the Sham\\", who with his group The Pharaohs had their first hit \\"Wooly Bully\\" in the summer of 1965. In 1966, a Farfisa was prominently heard in \\"Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love)\\" recorded by the South Carolina-based group The Swingin' Medallions. Spooner Oldham, the house organist of Alabama recording studio Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, can be heard playing the Farfisa on numerous southern soul recordings from the 1960s, notably \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" by Percy Sledge, among many others. The 1967 release of \\"Second Best\\" by The Household Sponge features a Farfisa Compact, played by Geoff Wright. Richard Wright's use of the Farfisa Compact Duo was integral to Pink Floyd's sound, the organ being his main instrument on the albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, More and Ummagumma. By 1970, he had started to use a Hammond Organ onstage and alternated between that and the Farfisa, depending on the song. The Farfisa was last used on \\"Dogs\\" from Animals, but Wright reintroduced it to his keyboard setup on David Gilmour's 2006 tour, featured notably on the Pink Floyd song \\"Echoes\\". Farfisa logo on Combo Compact Sly Stone from Sly and the Family Stone played a Farfisa Professional, as seen at their 1969 Woodstock Festival performance. Hugh Banton from Van der Graaf Generator originally used the Farfisa Professional, applying his knowledge of electronics and contacts as a former BBC engineer to customise it with a variety of additional effects pedals, including distortion and phasing. The Professional is the only organ used on The Aerosol Grey Machine and The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other, after which he also started using Hammonds. It was retired after the group's 1972 split. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin used a Farfisa on \\"Dancing Days\\" from Houses of the Holy, as well as occasionally using a VIP-255 or a Professional model on stage. Another famous recording is the 1970 A Tribute to Jack Johnson by Miles Davis, where Herbie Hancock plays spontaneous licks on a broken Farfisa. Composer Philip Glass began using Farfisa organs with his ensemble in the late 1960s. =1970s= With the advent of synthesizers, organs such as the classic Farfisa seemed to be headed for obsolescence, but time proved otherwise. In the late 1970s, with older models becoming cheaper, numerous punk rock and New Wave bands (especially those influenced by 1960s garage rock and psychedelia), such as Blondie, The B-52s, Suicide, Squeeze, Human Switchboard, XTC and Talking Heads embraced Farfisas as substitutes for more sophisticated keyboards and synthesizers. Their classic sound, in turn, became a staple on multitimbral instruments, first synthesized, then sampled from the originals. Numerous songs by the Industrial group Cabaret Voltaire use Farfisa drum machines and organs. \\"Crocodile Rock\\" by Elton John features a Farfisa organ, played by John in a honky-tonk rhythm with carnival-style riffs. The introduction of the Farfisa into West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s played an important role in evolution of Highlife, Mbalax, and later Afro-rock. This can be heard in the work of seminal acts like K. Frimpong and Monomono. The Farfisa sound is today used to impart a stereotypical 1960s-retro essence to music. It was a key ingredient to the sound of bands such as Inspiral Carpets and has appeared recently on many albums by contemporary artists. The Farfisa brand name, meanwhile, continues to appear on contemporary MIDI keyboards. The Italian keyboardist/artist Joey Mauro used various Farfisas (Syntorchestra, Professional, Compact, Deluxe, and VIP) to create sound in his Italo disco songs. =1980s= Farfisa Pergamon (c.1984) One of Farfisa's most distinctive and expensive organs was the , which debuted in 1981. Due to its weight of over , the Pergamon didn't have a portable version. =1990s= The Post-rock group Stereolab used various Farfisa organs extensively throughout their career. They were also used by Candida Doyle of the Sheffield group Pulp. A Farfisa was used on Mike Watt's \\"Against the 70's\\", played by former Nirvana bassist, Krist Novoselic. Christian alternative rock band Caedmon‚Äôs Call used a Farfisa organ on the song‚Äô Stupid Kid‚Äô off their self-titled debut in 1997. =after 1990s= The rock group Green Day used a Farfisa organ on the song \\"Misery\\" from the album Warning, played by their bassist Mike Dirnt. Series Farfisa Foyer (1963), a predecessor of Mini Compact =Compact Series (1964‚Äì1969)= The Compact series had four models. On the Compact Duo dual manual organs, tone and volume were regulated by controls on the F/AR combination preamp, reverb and power supply unit. On most other models the tone controls and a bass section volume were located on an indented panel on the rear of the keyboard. Underneath the keyboards, a knee-high lever could be actuated for the tone boost feature, turned on by rocker levers on the console. All models had reverb except for the mini-compact. Optional feature: 13-note bass pedals (not for the mini- compact). Mini-compact The Mini-Compact is the smallest of the Compact Series. It has only four octaves, with no bass on the early models. The later version had a selector switch to choose bass or high sound in the lowest octave; these models had grey naturals with white sharps in the bass octave. Some of these extended bass models have only three voices (sounds), while the later models had six voices. * Tan/black Tolex * Early model (Mini Compact, Mini Deluxe Compact) had three tone switches: dolce, principale, strings * Late model (Mini Deluxe I Compact): 16' bass; 8' flute, oboe, strings; 4' flute and strings * Three organ footages: 16', 8', 4' * Multi-tone booster with knee trigger (also served as expression control). * 1/4\\" headphone output * Swell (expression) pedal (optional) * Removable legs which stored inside bottom cover (all other models have folding/pivoting non-removable legs) * Solid State Preamp The model was used by Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Kate Radley of Spiritualized and by Steve Reich in his piece Four Organs. Early Compact (Combo Compact) Farfisa Combo Compact Features: * Red/black or grey/black Tolex * One octave of bass with inverse key colors. * 16' bass, strings * 8' flute, oboe, trumpet, strings * 4' flute, piccolo, strings * 4 vibrato settings * 3 reverb settings * 3 rockers for bass volume * Multi-tone booster * Swell (expression) pedal * 1/4\\" headphone output * Tube preamp (2 12AX7s) and real spring reverb * 1/4\\" bass optional output * Independent bass and treble 1/4\\" outputs * Back panel adjustments for treble and bass tone as well as bass output volume Late COMPACT (COMBO COMPACT I) Features: * Same as Early Combo Compact except: * Two inferior octaves (one black/white, one grey/white) on the left-hand side of the keyboard; one set of octaves were switch-controllable for choice of a bass or acute sound with bass note sustain and controllable bass percussion. * Volume balance control between bass and treble on the front panel (trim pot as opposed to rockers of the earlier version) * Sharp and Soft sound for the manual bass * Only backpanel adjustment is for bass output. Compact Deluxe Features: * Tan/black tolex * Two inferior octaves (one black/white, one grey/white) on the left- hand side of the keyboard; one set of octaves were switch-controllable for choice of a bass or high sound. * Bass note sustain and soft/sharp controls. * Independent controllable percussion for both bass and treble manuals. * 16' bass, strings * 8' flute, oboe, trumpet, strings * 4' flute, piccolo, strings * 2-2/3' with independent \\"brilliant\\" tab * 4 vibrato settings * Tube preamp (2 12AX7s) and real spring reverb * 3 reverb settings * Multi-tone booster * Swell (expression) pedal + knee control for multi-tone booster * Independent bass and treble 1/4\\" outputs * 1/4\\" headphone output * Late models (Combo Deluxe Compact I) also includes a rhythm section (drum machine) of brush cymbal and drum Compact duo Farfisa Compact Duo (Pink Floyd's) Most renowned of the Compact Series, having been used by Rick Wright (Pink Floyd), Stereolab, Al Kooper (Blues Project), Michael MacNeil (Simple Minds), Keith Emerson (ELP), and Clint Boon (The Inspiral Carpets). Features: * Grey/Black Tolex * Four-octave upper keyboard with 9 selectors: 16' Bass, Strings; 8' Flute, Oboe, Trumpet, Strings; 4' Flute, Strings; 2-2/3' (Flute), Brilliance * Four-octave lower keyboard with three selectors: Dolce, Principale, Ottava. * Two inferior octaves on the left-hand side of the lower keyboard; one octave was switch-controllable for choice of a bass or acute sound. * 4 vibrato settings * 3 reverb settings * Multi-Tone Booster * Swell (expression) pedal + knee control for Multi-Tone Booster * Bass note volume control, sustain, sharp, and percussion. * 1/4\\" Bass output * Lower manual volume control * Brilliance control which only works with the 2-2/3 (Flute) Tab. * Later models also incorporate tremolo, percussion and repeat functions for both the upper and lower treble manuals independently. * Unlike other Compact series organs, the Compact Duo models require a separate power supply/solid-state preamp/real spring reverb unit (called the Farfisa F/AR), to which the organ connects via a multi-lead cable. The American version used a 7-pin Amphenol connector, while European models used a 16-pin bakelite (Hirschmann MES 160). Treble output is available only via the F/AR. Farfisa Amplifier Models BR80 or Twin 80 accept the 7-pin connector and power the organ, allowing the Compact Duo to operate directly, without the F/AR; Farfisa Amplifier Models TR60 accepts the Multipin connector and powers the organ, allowing the Compact Duo to operate directly, without the F/AR. Rocker switches on the organ activate the reverb in the amplifiers (a TelRay (Adineko) reverb/echo unit (oilcan) built into the speaker cabinet). =FAST Series (1968‚Äì1971)= The FAST (Farfisa All Silicon Transistor) Series models had a metal cabinet covered with a washable skin plate and plastic edges, chrome folding legs, retractable carrying handles, and a removable music rack. This model of Farfisa was used by Philip Glass on some of his early recordings. This series had the combo organs (FAST 2,3,4,5,Console), and the Professional (Original, Duo, and Pianos) Fast 3 Farfisa Fast 3 Features: * Keyboard: 49 notes (C to C) * Manual Bass: 12 notes (C to B) * Voice Stops (7): Bass, Clarinet, Flute (8'), Oboe, Trumpet, Strings, Flute (4') * Vibrato Stops: On/off, Fast/slow * Manual Bass Selector: Bass/treble, Piano/forte * Swell pedal: Optional Fast 4 Features: * Keyboard: 61 notes * Voice Stops (8): Bass, Bass Clarinet, Flute (8'), Oboe, Trumpet, Flute, Oboe, Trumpet, Strings, Flute (4'), Piccolo * Mixture Stops (2) * Vibrato Stops (3): On/off, Slow/Fast, Light/Heavy * Percussion Stops (5): Manual bass on/off, Treble on/off, Long/short, Mixture on/off, Mixture soft/sharp * Manual Bass Selector: Bass/treble * Pedal and Manual Bass Sound: Soft/Sharp * FAST 4 has been used by Philip Glass Fast 5 The Troubadour, Los Angeles, 2010-01-14 Features, same as FAST 4, plus: * Sustain Stops (3): Celesta, Clavicord, Kinura Artists: * FAST 5 used by Ronnie Rancifer (Jackson 5) and The Black Keys. =Professional Series (1968 - 1975)= Farfisa Professional (probably PP/222) Notable artists: Candida Doyle (Pulp), The Ventures (seen on Hawaii Five-O clip), Irmin Schmidt (Can) Laurent Sinclair of (Taxi Girl), These are the most sophisticated models made by Farfisa. In 1972 Leir Siegler and started producing VIP models and custom models. * Professional (PP/222 and PP/221): The original single keyboard organ with gray keys. There are two models, with and without foot pedals. Used by Sylvester Stewart (of Sly and the Family Stone). Also by Sun Ra, Tangerine Dream, Jean-Michel Jarre, Kevin Ayers, Fran√ßois de Roubaix, Anthony Cedric Vuagniaux, Amon D√º√ºl II, Art Neville, and Hugh Banton of Van der Graaf Generator. This model later evolved to the VIP 345 and VIP 370. * Professional DUO: Double keyboard version with bass pedals and an option (white keys). There are two models. This model later evolved to the VIP 400, VIP 500, and VIP 600. * Professional Piano - used by Ralf Hutter of Kraftwerk (track Tanzmuzik), Edgar Froese of Tangerine Dream throughout 1975 and Irmin Schmidt of Can. There are two models, and a Super Piano model in a console style with integrated amp and speakers. During this same time period, Farfisa also produced a line of effect pedals: the Repeat/Volume pedal (in orange), the Wah-Wah/Volume pedal (in green), and the Sferasound pedal (in blue). There was also a high-end amplifier called the 80 or S-80, which came with speaker cabinets, either the Twin-80, or the BR-80. =VIP Series= Farfisa VIP 345 * VIP 200 * VIP 202 * VIP 205 and 205 r * VIP 233 used by G√∂ran Fritzon of Swedish group Gyllene Tider, featuring Per Gessle from Roxette. * VIP 345 (redesigned Professional) used by Susan Dey (in role as Laurie Partridge, The Partridge Family). * VIP 255 used by John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin). * VIP 370 (redesigned VIP345) * VIP 400 (redesigned Professional DUO) used by Edgar Froese of Tangerine Dream * VIP 500 (improved VIP 400) * VIP 600 (improved VIP 500) used by Michael MacNeil (Simple Minds). =Matador= Farfisa Matador M The Farfisa Matador was produced in the early to mid-1970s. It is a compact organ with a built-in speaker and amplifier. Several models of Matador were produced. * Matador A * Matador LR * Matador M (model 111124) appears in 1972/1973 Farfisa catalogs * Matador SR * Matador 80 =Syntorchestra= In the mid-1970s Farfisa produced the \\"Stereo Syntorchestra\\", with a three octave keyboard, and \\"mono\\" and \\"poli\\" tone generator sections. The \\"poli\\" section has four timbres: Trombone, Trumpet, Piano, and Viola. The mono section is the \\"synth\\" part of the machine. It has nine timbres: Tuba, Trombone, Trumpet, Bari Sax, Alto Sax, Bass Flute, Flute, Piccolo, and Violin. This section is monophonic, with a highest note priority. The mono section can be modified by two envelope controls and a wah-wah; there is also a variable portamento. Only one timbre from each section can be used at a time. Each section has a brilliance control, which adds more top end to the sound, and a variable speed vibrato, which has a delay function, for delayed vibrato effects. The Syntorchestra also has separate outputs for each of its two sections. Farfisa also produced two very large organs which incorporated the Syntorchestra at this time, the 259r and 6290r \\"Maharani\\" organs. Some examples of recordings including the Farfisa Syntorchestra are New Age of Earth by Ashra (Manuel G√∂ttsching) and Moondawn by Klaus Schulze (especially the first half of the B-side, \\"Mindphaser\\"). Farfisa Soundmaker (1979‚Äì1981) The Syntorchestra was produced at a similar period in the mid-1970s to the more basic String Orchestra, which included piano and string sections. The Soundmaker was Farfisa's next non-organ instrument, with a further development of the synthesizer approach, incorporating string, brass and monosynth sections. =Polychrome= The \\"Polychrome\\", built at the end of the 1970s, was Farfisa's largest and most well-featured non-organ instrument, as an analog synthesizer featuring vocal, brass, string, and percussion sections, and including a built in chorus, phaser and modulation as well as aftertouch sensitivity. =Transicord= Farfisa Transicord The \\"Transicord\\" was a transistor electric accordion. Essentially, it was not a true accordion; an \\"accordion-shaped combo organ\\" would have been perhaps a more fitting name. There were no reeds; it was purely electronic. It was designed to be used in conjunction with Farfisa's amplifiers, and had a multi-pin cable that connected the controls of the accordion, with the controls of the amplifier, or the F/AR Reverb preamp power supply unit. The Transicord came in two models, a \\"standard\\" and a \\"DeLuxe.\\" The standard has one row of stop-tabs similar to those found on a Combo Compact organ, and is reported to have a similar sound. The color scheme was grey with light blue and green. The DeLuxe has two rows of stop-tabs and is black in color. Opening and closing the bellows reportedly engage an effect similar to the \\"tone boost\\" knee lever on Combo Compact model organs. The Transicord can also be equipped with the same volume pedal used for many other Farfisa organs. =Bravo and Commander= Among the very last combo organs made by Farfisa were the Bravo and Commander, produced at the end of the 1970s. The Commander reprised part of the design of the VIP 205 in updated form, while the lightweight and simple Bravo's sound was a move to reflect the changing tastes of the time.

The parish includes the hamlets of Norrington Common and The Common. History Formerly much of Broughton Gifford and the surrounding area was covered with woodland. Much of this was felled during the First and Second World Wars. Villagers long used the common to graze their livestock and grow their crops. Although the common was not included when the rest of the parish's lands were inclosed in 1783,Pugh & Crittall, 1956, pages 51‚Äì59 eventually its agricultural uses died out. Railway The Wessex Main Line railway was opened across the southeast of the parish in 1848, following the Avon valley. In October 1905 a small station, , was opened for the newly- introduced steam railcar service between Chippenham and Trowbridge. The halt was southeast of the village at the Mill Lane bridge, near the road between Melksham and Bradford-on-Avon; it was closed on 7 February 1955 but the line remains open. Geography The village has two parts. The lower village has the church, the school, the village hall and The Rusty Stag public house. There are also two housing estates and some detached houses in this part. The higher part, The Common, is a large area of open land with houses around it. As at 2008 there were three ponds on the common, inhabited by a paddling of ducks in their breeding season. At one end of the common is the Bell public house, and the football pitch and bowling green. The River Avon forms a natural boundary to the south and east of the parish. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions. Unusually the parish shares some land in common with the parish of Melksham Without.  Religious sites  = Parish church = Parish church The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin, at the south end of the village, is from the 13th century and is a Grade I listed building. Additions in the 14th century included the south chapel, and the tower was added in the 15th. The rectory was built in 1848 to designs of T.H. Wyatt, and the church was lightly restored by G.G. Scott in 1878. St Mary's is part of the united benefice of St Katherine's at Holt, together with All Saints at Great Chalfield. = Chapels = A Particular Baptist chapel was built in 1806 on the east side of the common, and is still in use. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1828 and replaced by a larger building in 1907. The chapel closed c. 2008 and is now a private home. Notable buildings Packhorse bridge over the Avon Three houses are Grade II* listed: * Gifford Hall, c.1700, The Common * Manor House, early 17th century, on the road to The Common * Monkton House, 1647, south of the village, by the Avon In March 2015 Mr Daniel Gerber, of Gifford Hall, obtained a decision in the High Court quashing a planning permission granted by Wiltshire Council for a ¬£10.5 million solar farm erected by Norrington Solar Farm Limited and Terraform Power.This Is Wiltshire, 6 March 2015 This decision was then overturned, allowing the solar farm to remain, some distance to the north of Gifford Hall. A packhorse bridge dating from 1725 spans the River Avon to the south of Broughton Gifford, providing a route (now a public footpath) to the hamlet of Whaddon. Amenities The village has a primary school, St Mary's, a short distance north of the church. Its first building dates from 1856, when it became a National School following the rebuilding of an earlier charity school. The school became Voluntary controlled in 1952 and was remodelled and extended in 1975. Broughton has two public houses. The Bell on the Common is on the common. The Fox, formerly the Fox and Hounds, is at the other end of the village. There are also a village hall, a butcher's shop, a small park and an industrial estate.

He was a Quaker.Bernet, Claus, in Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon (BBKL), Band 30, Nordhausen 2009 Life Harris was born to a Congregationalist family and grew up as one of eleven children. His father, Henry Marmaduke Harris, was a house decorator. His mother, Elizabeth Corker Harris, ran a shop selling baby clothes. His paternal aunt, Augusta Harris, was the mother of the poet Henry Austin Dobson. After studying at Plymouth Grammar school, he enrolled at Clare College, Cambridge, and was third at the mathematical Tripos of 1874. He was a fellow of Clare College from 1875 to 1878, in 1892, and from 1902 to 1904. In 1880, he married a Quaker from Plymouth, Helen Balkwill, and under her influence and that of the Evangelical Revival of the 1870s, in 1885 he became a member of the Society of Friends. He moved to the United States in 1882 following his wife who was at the time engaged in missionary work, and was appointed professor of New Testament Greek at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, US (1882‚Äì85). Harris resigned his post in response to criticism that his attack on the vivisection practiced in the Johns Hopkins laboratories had elicited from his colleagues. The couple returned to Britain for a short while, as Harris was soon appointed professor in Biblical Studies at Haverford College, near Philadelphia (1886‚Äì91). In 1888-1889, while on leave from Haverford, he travelled to Palestine and Egypt, purchasing 47 rolls and codices written in Hebrew, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, Armenian and Ethiopic. He said that these texts, which discussed biblical and linguistic topics and some of which were as old as the 13th century, were \\"all acquired by the lawful, though sometimes tedious, processes of Oriental commerce.\\" During this journey, he also discovered the Syriac version of the Apology of Aristides in the Monastery of Saint Catherine. Upon his return, he donated the manuscripts he had collected to Haverford. They are held by the college library's Quaker Collection.Haverford College In 1903 he was appointed the first director of studies at the Society of Friends' new college at Woodbrooke near Birmingham. In accepting the post, he turned down an appointment as a professor of theology at Leiden University. However, students from Leiden attended his courses at Woodbrooke. The university later awarded him a doctorate.Falcetto, A. The Daily Discoveries of a Bible Scholar and Manuscript Hunter: A biography of James Rendel Harris 1852‚Äî1941.

One of the most infamous bank robbers in South Africa's history, Stander was notorious for the audacious manner with which he carried out his crimes; he sometimes carried out the crime on his lunch break, often returning to the scene as an investigating officer.The police officer turned bank robber at CNN Stander was portrayed by American actor Thomas Jane in the 2003 film Stander.  Police career  The son of a prominent figure in the South African Prison Service, Major General Francois Jacobus Stander (1916‚Äì2001), Andr√© was under pressure from an early age to pursue a career in law enforcement. He enrolled at the South African Police training college near Pretoria in 1963, graduating at the top of his class. Shortly afterwards he joined the Kempton Park criminal investigation department.  Criminal activities  = Robberies = Zonderwater prison In 1977, Stander flew to Durban and robbed his first bank. Between 1977 and 1980, he is believed to have stolen nearly a hundred thousand rand. After robbing nearly 30 banks, Stander was arrested and sentenced to 75 years in prison on 6 May 1980. However, since many of the charges in the sentence ran concurrently, he faced an actual sentence of 17 years. Stander met Allan Heyl and Lee McCall at the Zonderwater maximum security prison. = Motivation = After his first trial, Stander claimed that his disillusionment with police service stemmed from a prior incident when he and his fellow officers shot and killed over twenty unarmed black residents of Thembisa during the 1976 Soweto uprising. However, Stander was not present with the police contingent at Thembisa when the alleged shooting took place. Other accounts have suggested that Stander, who completed his national service in Angola during the South African Border War, may have also been bored with civilian life and craved the excitement afforded by a life of crime. = Stander Gang = On 11 August 1983, Stander and McCall, along with five other inmates, were taken from its premises for a physiotherapy appointment. Once the prisoners were left alone with the physiotherapist, Stander and McCall overpowered her and escaped. The other prisoners refused to participate and stayed behind.The Stander Gang Stander and McCall returned to Zonderwater on 31 October 1983, in order to spring Allan Heyl from the facility where he was taking a trade test. From that day until the end of January 1984, the three began robbing banks together, under the nom de guerre of the Stander Gang ‚Äì a term coined by the news media. McCall was killed on 30 January 1984, in a police raid on the gang's hide-out in Houghton Estate, Gauteng. Heyl fled to Greece, then England, then Spain, and eventually back to England, where he was caught, tried, and sentenced to nine years in prison for robbery and a related firearms charge. After serving his time in the UK, he was extradited back to South Africa where he was sentenced to a further 33 years in prison. Heyl was released on parole on 18 May 2005. While police were closing in on McCall in South Africa, Stander had been in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, trying to arrange for the sale of the gang's recently purchased sailing yacht‚Äîthe Lilly Rose‚Äîthat they planned to use for their final getaway once they had acquired enough money.  Florida and death  While Stander remained in the United States, international arrest warrants and all points bulletins were issued for his arrest. Trying to make the best of the situation, Stander created the false identity of an Australian author named \\"Peter Harris\\" and forged a driver's license. Afterwards, he visited a used car lot and purchased a Ford Mustang from a dealer named Anthony Tomasello. On 10 February 1984, police pulled Stander over while he was driving and arrested him for driving an unregistered vehicle. Being relatively unknown to the American authorities at that time, Stander presented his false ID to the police, who recognized it as a forgery and subsequently seized it‚Äîadding driver's license forgery to his list of offenses‚Äîbut believed his story about his identity and released him. Once released on the same evening, Stander returned to the police impound lot where his seized Mustang was being kept, broke in and stole the car. On the following morning, Stander returned to the same used car lot where he had purchased the vehicle and asked the same dealer, Tomasello, to have the car re-painted in a different colour. However, Tomasello had just read about the Stander Gang in a local newspaper. He told Stander that he would help him, got his information, and as soon as Stander had left, Tomasello called his lawyer. On his lawyer's advice, Tomasello called the local police. Based on Tomasello's information, a police tactical unit surrounded the apartment that Stander had been using as a hideout, but Stander was not there. He had acquired a bicycle to use while his car was with Tomasello to be repainted. He had left the apartment on the bicycle and returned only after the police had surrounded it. As he unknowingly rode up to the apartment complex, officer Michael van Stetina‚Äîwho had been posted on the perimeter‚Äîrecognised Stander and attempted to stop him. Stander tried to get away, but as Stetina prevented his escape a struggle for the officer's shotgun began. The gun discharged and Stander was hit; he fell onto the apartment complex's driveway, bleeding profusely. Stetina immediately radioed for an ambulance. Although officer Stetina tried to administer first aid, Stander's wounds were too extensive and he bled to death before an ambulance arrived.

Bugge Bridge) is a floating bridge in the northwest United States, located in western Washington. It carries State Route 104 across Hood Canal of Puget Sound and connects the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. At in length (floating portion ), it is the longest floating bridge in the world located in a saltwater tidal basin, and the fourth longest floating bridge overall. First opened in 1961, it was the second concrete floating bridge constructed in Washington. Since that time, it has become a vital link for local residents, freight haulers, commuters, and recreational travelers. The convenience it provides has had a major impact on economic development, especially in eastern Jefferson County. The bridge is officially named after William A. Bugge (1900‚Äì1992), the director of the Department of Highways from 1949 to 1963, who was a leader in the planning and construction of the bridge. History =Design, fabrication, and construction= Seen from the north (Termination Point) Hood Canal Bridge from Buena Vista Cemetery, Port Gamble, Washington. Aerial view of the bridge's southeast half, with drawspan section at far left The design and planning process for the Hood Canal Bridge took nearly a decade amid criticism from some engineers throughout that time. Critics questioned the use of floating pontoons over salt water, especially at a location with high tide fluctuations and the concern that the funneling effect of the Hood Canal might magnify the intensity of winds and tides. The depth of the water, however, made construction of support columns for other bridge types prohibitively expensive. The water depth below the pontoons ranges from . In its marine environment, the bridge is exposed to tidal swings of . The pontoons for the bridge were fabricated in the Duwamish Waterway in Seattle; during fabrication, two of the pontoons sank. When they were attached for the first time, and then towed into place and anchored, sea conditions in the Hood Canal were too severe and the pontoons were returned to a nearby bay until a better method of attaching could be devised. The structural engineers and the contractor decided the design was faulty. A new contractor was hired and the design modified. It was decided to use a large rubber dam between each of the two pontoons as they were attached, clean the concrete surfaces of all marine growth, epoxy, and tension them with a number of cables welded to a variety of attachment points. This system seemed to work from when the bridge opened in 1961 until the disaster of 1979. The eastern approach span weighs more than 3,800 tons (3,400 tonnes) and the western approach span weighs more than 1,000 tons (907 tonnes) =1979 sinking= The Hood Canal Bridge suffered catastrophic failure in 1979 during the February 13 windstorm. During the night, the bridge had withstood sustained winds of up to and gusts estimated at , and finally succumbed at about 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, The western drawspan and the pontoons of the western half had broken loose and sunk, despite the drawspan being opened to relieve lateral pressure. At the time of the failure, the bridge had been closed to highway traffic and the tower crew had evacuated; no casualties resulted. Evidence points to blown-open hatches allowing flooding of the pontoons as the cause of the sinking. =West-half reconstruction and 1982 re-opening= retracts under it. Efforts to repair the bridge began immediately and Washington Secretary of Transportation William A. Bulley secured a commitment of federal emergency relief money for the project. On June 15, 1979, actual work began with the removal of the west truss and transport for storage. The state's department of transportation attempted to mitigate the impact of the disaster by redirecting traffic to US Highway 101 to drive around the length of Hood Canal and by reestablishing the state ferry run between Lofall and South Point across the canal just south of the bridge. This route had been discontinued after the 1961 bridge opening and the state needed to reacquire access to and restore operational conditions on both landings. During the course of the closure an additional ferry route was temporarily added between Edmonds and Port Townsend. The Hood Canal Bridge re- opened to vehicular traffic in 1982 on Sunday, The west portion replacement had been designed and constructed in less than three years using $100 million in federal emergency bridge replacement funds at a total cost of $143 million (equivalent to $ today).. The bridge reopened as a toll bridge, but tolls were lifted in 1985 after a court ruled that the insurance settlement constituted repayment of the construction bonds, and since federal funds were used in reconstructing the bridge, the Washington State Department of Transportation could not charge tolls after the bonds were retired. =East-half replacement= In a project that lasted from 2003 to 2009, WSDOT replaced the east-half floating portion of the bridge, the east and west approach spans, the east and west transition spans, and the west-half electrical system. The total cost of the project, about $471 million, was paid for by state, federal and agency funds. The project required the bridge to close to traffic for five weeks to allow the old pontoons of the east-half to be cut away and the new pontoons floated into position, cabled together and connected by cables to large anchors on the sea floor. The transition spans and center draw span were also replaced during this closure. The bridge reopened June 3, 2009. The pontoons and anchors for the bridge could not be built at the bridge site due to space and facility limitations. WSDOT evaluated different sites at which to build during a site selection process. The Port Angeles graving dock was chosen for its accessibility to water and land as well as the work force. Before purchase, the National Historic Preservation Act required archaeologists to perform a review of the historical site. At that time, \\"there was no evidence of historic properties or cultural resources\\" (NEPA Re- evaluation Consultation, FHWA) and WSDOT was able to purchase the site and begin construction. Within the first two weeks of construction, artifacts were found from an ancestral burial ground from an ancient village called Tse-whit- zen. WSDOT stopped all work on the site, and a government-to-government consultation process began among the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, WSDOT, the Federal Highway Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the State Historical Preservation Office. On August 14, 2006, WSDOT agreed to donate the site to the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe, rebury all remains uncovered, and pay $2.5 million in damages.Associated Press. \\"Settlement reached in Indian burial site\\" http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/news/breaking_news/15274953.htm August 14, 2006 (accessed September 19, 2006) It is believed that this discovery may be documentation of the first time that Natives and non-Natives began to interact on this shore. These historical findings will be investigated thoroughly by the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and archaeologists. On December 21, 2004, Governor Locke and Secretary MacDonald announced that WSDOT would stop pontoon and anchor construction at the Tse-whit-zen site in Port Angeles and begin searching for a more suitable place to build. Many sites were considered but the best option to be found by WSDOT was in Tacoma, Wash. at Concrete Technology. Construction began on the new east-half floating pontoons at Concrete Technology in April 2006. Fourteen pontoons will be built in four cycles at the site. Completed pontoons will be floated out of the graving dock in Tacoma and transported to Seattle for outfitting at Todd Shipyards. Outfitting includes adding all electrical and mechanical parts, connecting the pontoons into sections and building the roadway on top of the pontoons. Another three pontoons, built during the west-half bridge replacement in the early 1980s, were retrofitted in Seattle. Use In planning for a prolonged closure of the bridge for the east-half replacement, the Washington State Department of Transportation conducted a five-day survey of bridge use in early June 1998 in order to assess closure impact and plan effective mitigation strategies. The survey was in three stages: A video camera count of traffic on weekdays (Tuesday and Wednesday) and a weekend (Friday through Sunday) to estimate average volume; the use of that video to record license plate numbers for vehicle registration addresses to assess which communities would be most affected; and the mailing of a questionnaire to the registered owners of those vehicles seeking information on trip origin, destination, and purpose, and choice of travel alternatives during a bridge closure. The video count produced a weekday average of 14,915 trips/day and a weekend average of 18,759 trips/day. Peak volumes reach 20,000 vehicles on summer weekends. The vehicle registration information indicated that a majority of trips were by residents of communities near the bridge. The most represented communities were, in numerical order, Port Ludlow (8%), Port Townsend (7%), Port Angeles (6%), Seattle (6%), Sequim (5%), Poulsbo (5%), Bremerton (4%), Port Hadlock (2%), and Silverdale (2%). The questionnaires revealed that a majority of trips were to and/or from communities near the bridge. On the weekend 48% of westbound trips originated on the north and central Kitsap Peninsula, with 88% of the destinations in areas near Port Ludlow, Port Townsend, Sequim, and Port Angeles. For weekday trips, nearly 55% of westbound trips originated in northern or central Kitsap County with 90% of the destinations in the Port Ludlow, Port Townsend, Sequim, and Port Angeles areas. A large number of eastbound weekday morning trips appeared to be for commuting purposes, with 92% of originating in Port Ludlow, Port Townsend, Sequim, or Port Angeles, and 60% with central or northern Kitsap County as a destination, and 32% ending in the Seattle metropolitan area. The evening westbound trips seemed to mirror the morning patterns. When asked the purpose of their trips, respondents reported that for weekend trips 21% were for recreational, 21% for social, 19% for personal, 18% for work, 6% for business, and 4% for medical reasons. For weekday trips 33% were for work, 17% for personal, 14% for business, 11% for medical, 9% for social, and 8% for recreational reasons. Sources *Burows, Alyssa. \\"Bulley, William A.

He attended Lake Placid Preparatory School in New York before attending Indiana University, where he graduated in 1930. Jenner worked as elevator operator in the old House Office Building while attending night classes at the George Washington University Law School. Jenner later graduated with a law degree from Indiana University Maurer School of Law, and practiced in Paoli and later in Shoals. Political career =Indiana Senate= Jenner entered politics in 1934, when he was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1934. He was minority leader from 1937 to 1939, and then majority leader and president pro tempore from 1939 to 1941. In 1940, Jenner ran for Governor of Indiana, finishing second at the Republican state convention. In 1942, during World War II, Jenner resigned his seat to become a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Jenner was discharged in 1944 at the rank of captain. =U.S. Senate= One month after his discharge from the Army Air Corps, Jenner was elected to the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by the death of Frederick Van Nuys. He served the last few months of Van Nuys's term from November 14, 1944, to January 3, 1945; he was not a candidate for the full six-year term that began in 1945.James H. Madison, Indiana through Tradition and Change: A History of the Hoosier State and Its People 1920‚Äì1945 (Indiana Historical Society Press, 2016), p. 403.JENNER, William Ezra, (1908-1985), Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. Jenner was the first veteran of World War II elected to the Senate and the youngest member of the Senate. He ran for the Senate in 1946 defeating Congressman Charles M. La Follette 1,994 to 105 at the Republican state convention. He then won the general election by over 150,000 votes. He ran for governor of Indiana for a second time in 1948, winning a plurality on the first ballot at the Republican state convention. Jenner lost the nomination on the second ballot to Holbart Creighton 885 to 931. Jenner was re-elected to the Senate in 1952. Jenner voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. McCarthyism In Congress, Jenner was the chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration during the Eighty-third Congress. He was also a member of the Subcommittee on Internal Security.Robert Griffith, The Politics of Fear: Joseph R. McCarthy and the Senate (University of Massachusetts Press, 1996), p. 196. He was a strong supporter and friend of Joseph McCarthy and engaged in McCarthyism.James Cross Giblin, The Rise and Fall of Senator Joe McCarthy (Clarion Books, 2009), pp. 252-254. Jenner and McCarthy were both part of \\"a core of isolationist Republicans in the Senate\\" along with Herman Welker of Idaho and George W. Malone of Nevada. In 1950, when McCarthy issued a report falsely accusing a number of State Department employees of being secret Communists (see Tydings Committee), Jenner supported him, claiming that the State Department had engaged in \\"the most scandalous and brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history\\" and stating: \\"Considering the fact that we are now at war ... how can we get the Reds out of Korea if we cannot get them out of Washington?\\"Giblin, p. 114-15. When McCarthy was censured by the Senate in 1954, Jenner gave a speech suggesting that censure resolution \\"was initiated by the Communist conspiracy.\\"Giblin, p. 252. In the Senate, Jenner was a strident opponent of General George Marshall, who was appointed Secretary of Defense in 1950. During the confirmation debate, Jenner and McCarthy was part of a group of militantly anti-communist Republican Senators that attacked Marshall. Jenner \\"delivered a shrill, hour- long attack on the nominee\\" in which he also disparaged President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of State Dean Acheson.Ed Cray, General of the Army: George C. Marshall, Soldier and Statesman (1990: Cooper Square Press ed. 2000), pp. 685-86. Exemplifying McCarthist rhetoric,Brian R. Farmer, American Conservatism: History, Theory and Practice (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2005), p. 256. Jenner accused the Truman administration of \\"bloody tracks of treason\\" and called Marshall \\"a living lie\\" who was \\"joining hands once more with this criminal crowd of traitors and Communist appeasers ... under the direction of Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson.\\"Cray, p. 686. Jenner also \\"denounced and blamed Marshall for the Pearl Harbor defeat and for his role in helping FDR 'trick America into a war,' the extension of lend-lease to the Communist Soviet Union, the 'selling out' of Eastern Europe at Yalta, the loss of China, and the inclusion of an offer of aid to the Soviet Union under the Marshall Plan.\\"Farmer, p. 256. When Marshall was informed of Jenner's speech, the former general replied: \\"Jenner? Jenner? I do not believe I know the man.\\"Cray, p. 686. In 1951, after President Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur for insubordination, Jenner gave a speech on the floor of the Senate in which he said: \\"I charge that this country today is in the hands of a secret inner coterie, which is directed by agents of the Soviet Government. Our only choice is to impeach President Truman and find out who is the secret invisible government.\\" Jenner introduced legislation that sought to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction \\"in all the areas where it had interfered with the anticommunist program,\\" a measure that Senator Lyndon B. Johnson maneuvered to oppose. Ultimately, Jenner's measure was tabled by a vote of 49-41.Lucas A.

Jenner claimed that the United Nations had infiltrated the American educational system in 1952. Later life and death In 1958, he did not seek re-nomination. After leaving the Senate, Jenner practiced law in Indianapolis and was the owner of the Seaway Corporation, a land development company. He also owned farms in Indiana and Illinois. He died at Dunn Memorial Hospital in Bedford, Indiana, of a respiratory illness, on March 9, 1985, at age 76. Jenner is interred at Crest Haven Memorial Gardens in Bedford, Indiana.

Jobin was born in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He moved to Flin Flon, in the northern part of the province, in 1935. He worked for Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting as a labourer, miner and surveyor, later working in the company's purchasing department. Jobin was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1949 provincial election, as a Liberal candidate supporting the government of Premier Douglas Campbell. Running in The Pas, he easily defeated independent incumbent Beresford Richards, who opposed the governing Liberal-Conservative coalition. Jobin was re-elected in the 1953 election, easily defeating opponents from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and Social Credit. On July 6, 1956, he was sworn in as Railway Commissioner and Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Campbell government. Provincial CCF leader Lloyd Stinson later referred to Jobin as Campbell's only \\"labour-oriented\\" minister. Campbell's Liberals were defeated by Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservatives in the 1958 election, but Jobin was able to retain the redistributed riding of Flin Flon. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative Charles Witney in the following year's election, however, as Roblin's Tories won a majority government. When Campbell resigned as Manitoba Liberal Party leader in 1961, Jobin was one of four candidates who sought to replace him. He was accused by some of representing \\"radical\\" elements within the party, though he denied this, using his friendship with the arch-conservative Campbell as evidence. Jobin was a somewhat marginal candidate, however, and received only 79 votes in the leadership convention, compared to 475 for the winner, Gildas Molgat. Jobin ran as a Liberal candidate in the sprawling northern riding of Churchill in the federal election of 1962, but finished a distant second against Progressive Conservative candidate Robert Simpson. In early 1963, he lost a deferred provincial election in Churchill to Progressive Conservative Gordon Beard, albeit by a relatively close margin. Jobin again lost to Simpson in the federal election of 1965. Jobin was elected to the Flin Flon Municipal Council in 1966.

She has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame, Gloria Allred Early life and education Gloria Rachel Bloom was born into a Jewish working-class family of Philadelphia on July 3, 1941. Her father, Morris,https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:24WQ-357 worked as a salesman; her British-born mother, Stella, was a housewife. After graduating from the Philadelphia High School for Girls, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she met her first husband, Peyton Huddleston Bray Jr. The couple had their only child, Lisa Bloom, on September 20, 1961, and divorced shortly after. Bloom is also an attorney and is best known as a former Court TV anchor. Gloria Bloom moved back in with her parents and continued her education. In 1963, she earned a bachelor's degree in English, graduating with honors. Over strong objections from her professor, she wrote her honors thesis on black writers. She was employed in a number of occupations before she decided to become a teacher, taking a position at Benjamin Franklin High School. She began work on a graduate degree at New York University, where she became interested in the civil rights movement. After earning a master's degree, she became a teacher and, in 1966, moved to Los Angeles, California, and lived in Watts. She worked for the Los Angeles Teachers Association and taught at Jordan High School and Fremont High School.Allred 2006, p. 16 In her autobiography she describes how, during a vacation in Acapulco in 1966, she was raped at gunpoint.Allred 2006, p. 17 She discovered she was pregnant and sought an abortion. Abortion was illegal for doctors to perform at the time so Allred had a back-alley abortion. After undergoing the procedure, she began hemorrhaging and became infected, only recovering after being hospitalized.Allred 2006, p. 18 She did not report the rape, she said, because she did not think anyone would believe her. In 1968, she married William Allred. She enrolled in Southwestern University School of Law and later transferred to Loyola University School of Law at the Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Allred graduated and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1975. Allred divorced her husband in 1987, retaining her married name. Career =Legal= In a legal career that has spanned four decades, Allred has represented a wide variety of clients in civil rights suits that have involved sexual harassment, women's rights, wrongful termination, and employment discrimination. The New Republic has called her \\"a longtime master of the press conference.\\" She often takes high-profile cases, using press conferences and appearances on television to much effect. Allred has represented many clients in suits against celebrities, including those against M√∂tley Cr√ºe drummer Tommy Lee, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Herman Cain, David Boreanaz, Scott Lee Cohen, Anthony Weiner, Sacha Baron Cohen, Esai Morales, and R Kelly. 1970s and 1980s Allred (right) with client Norma McCorvey (\\"Jane Roe\\" in Roe v.

In 1981, while California State Senator John G. Schmitz was leading hearings on outlawing abortion, Allred presented him with a chastity belt. Schmitz retaliated in a press release, calling her a \\"slick butch lawyeress.\\" She sued him for libel, and eventually secured a settlement of $20,000 and an apology. In 1985, Allred, along with Catharine MacKinnon, drafted a version of the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance for Los Angeles County. The legislation failed to pass the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. p 250. In 1987, Allred took on the then all-male Friars Club of Beverly Hills, an exclusive private club, over its membership discrimination policies.

She kept pressure on the Committee and urged Packwood to release his diaries. The Committee eventually voted for his expulsion, and he resigned.Allred 2006, pp. 56‚Äì60 In 1983, Allred represented lesbian activists Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol√≥n in their lawsuit against the owner of a Los Angeles restaurant, Papa Choux, after he denied them service in a booth reserved for \\"romantic couples\\".Jet (magazine), Apr 16, 1984, Vol. 66, No. 6, p. 38 While the lower court denied the two an injunction based on unlawful discrimination, the appellate court reversed the decision in Rolon v. Kulwitzky (1984), finding that the restaurant's behavior was discrimination prohibited under the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Rather than serve LGBT couples, the restaurant decided to eliminate the booths altogether, and took out newspaper ads inviting the public to a \\"Wake for Romance\\" event. In 1995, Allred represented eleven-year-old Katrina Yeaw in Yeaw v. Boy Scouts of America, a suit against the Boy Scouts of America to determine whether the organization had the right to exclude girls from being members.Allred 2006, pp. 117‚Äì121 That same year, she represented Nicole Brown Simpson's family during the O.

She took the case pro bono for Robin Tyler and Diane Olson and Rev. Troy Perry and his husband Phillip Ray De Blieck. The case went to the California Supreme Court where on May 15, 2008 she won a decision affirming the right of same sex couples to marry in California. She represented three former Circuit City employees on behalf of a large plaintiff class in an age discrimination lawsuit against that company after it fired 3,400 workers nationwide in April 2007. In a March 2008 complaint against the TSA, Allred represented a client who was given pliers and told to remove her nipple rings at a Lubbock, Texas, airport. In April 2008, it was reported that she had been hired by the family of the teenager who had been beaten and filmed by eight Florida teenagers.Lindsay Family Hire Allred, http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=78204 She also appeared on Today with Jessica Gibson, who was counter-suing Rob Lowe for sexual harassment.

In August 2010, Allred represented Jodie Fisher, whose sexual harassment claim revealed expense- account irregularities that led to the resignation of HP CEO Mark Hurd. Allred was visible in the 2010 California Gubernatorial race, going public as the lawyer for Nicky Diaz, a former domestic worker for Republican nominee Meg Whitman. Allred contended that Whitman employed Diaz for years while knowing that Diaz was an undocumented immigrant. On April 27, 2011, Allred appeared at a press conference with the family of Justin Quinn, who was allegedly threatened at a San Francisco Giants baseball game by Braves coach Roger McDowell. Quinn had objected to McDowell's uttering of homophobic slurs and use of a baseball bat to simulate a sex act in the presence of his daughters. On October 18, 2011, Allred won court approval to represent nine former middle-aged cocktail waitresses who were fired from their jobs at Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey after they \\"did not look good enough\\" in new uniforms modeled after 1920s-era Flapper outfits. Resorts had sought to bar Allred from the discrimination lawsuit, arguing in court papers that her \\"flamboyant and headline-grabbing antics\\" would add nothing to the case. On March 9, 2012, Allred called for an investigation into whether radio host Rush Limbaugh should be prosecuted in Florida under a 19th-century law against \\"maliciously imputing to [any woman] a want of chastity\\" for derogatory remarks he made regarding Sandra Fluke, who testified before House Democrats to advocate for free birth control. Allred commented: \\"Mr. Limbaugh targeted his attack on a young law student who was simply exercised [sic] her free speech and her right to testify before congress on a very important issue to millions of American women and he vilified her. ... He needs to face the consequences of his conduct in every way that is meaningful.\\" Allred did not represent Fluke or have contact with her at the time of her remarks nor did the prosecutor's office respond to request for comment.Lee, MJ. \\"Gloria Allred seeks Rush Limbaugh prosecution\\" Politico. March 9, 2012. Also in 2012, Allred took on the case of Jenna Talackova, a Canadian transgender woman who was challenging her disqualification from the Miss Universe Canada pageant for not being a \\"naturally born\\" female.\\"Jenna Talackova‚Äîarmed with a high-profile lawyer‚Äîfires back at Miss Universe Canada\\".

On October 4, 2013 Allred was hired by the wife of a critically injured motorcyclist Edwin Mieses, who was run over by Alexian Lien during the Hollywood Stuntz gang assault. Lien ran over Mieses with his SUV while Lien was being surrounded and threatened by Mieses and his motorcycle gang on Manhattan's West Side Highway. Fellow bikers later caught up with Lien and assaulted him. Allred told the press that Mieses, who suffered spinal injuries and two broken legs, was an \\"innocent victim\\" who was trying to \\"defuse the situation\\". Allred is representing at least 28 women who accuse Bill Cosby of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and/or other sexual misconduct. She is also representing three women who accuse Donald Trump of sexual misconduct‚Äîclaims which Trump has denied, and which first arose during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In 2017, former Allred client Kyle Hunter filed official complaints with both the State Bar of California and the District of Columbia Bar, alleging conflict of interest because Allred was in negotiations with CBS at the same time she was representing him in a lawsuit against CBS for employment discrimination. Allred issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming the investigation was sparked by a failed extortion attempt. On November 11, 2017, Allred held a press conference representing her client Beverly Young Nelson, as she made a statement alleging sexual assault perpetrated by Roy Moore when she was 16 years old. In 2019, New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey discussed the ways in which Allred and her firm profited from non- disclosure agreements they negotiated, which silenced victims of sexual misconduct through \\"secret settlements\\" and \\"bur[ied] allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\\" Allred's practice negotiated non-disclosures for a victim of Harvey Weinstein, and victims of Fox News host Bill O‚ÄôReilly and the Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Allred was vocal in her dislike of a proposed 2017 California bill that would ban non-disclosure clauses in agreements that silence victims of sexual harassment or assault. In February 2020, Allred hired an American-style school bus to encourage Prince Andrew to respond to talk to the FBI about the sexual misconduct allegations surrounding him. The school bus was covered with an advertisement and placed outside of Buckingham Palace, London, and included photographs of the Duke of York and a message urging him to answer questions surrounding the controversy. =Entertainment= Allred co-hosted a radio talkshow with Mark Taylor on KABC in Los Angeles for fourteen years.

The development, via plant breeding, of new varieties is a major occupation of floriculturists. Floriculture crops include bedding plants, houseplants, flowering garden and pot plants, cut cultivated greens, and cut flowers. As distinguished from nursery crops, floriculture crops are generally herbaceous. Bedding and garden plants consist of young flowering plants (annuals and perennials) and vegetable plants. They are grown in cell packs (in flats or trays), in pots, or in hanging baskets, usually inside a controlled environment, and sold largely for gardens and landscaping. Pelargonium (\\"geraniums\\"), Impatiens (\\"busy lizzies\\"), and Petunia are the best-selling bedding plants. The many cultivars of Chrysanthemum are the major perennial garden plant in the United States. Flowering plants are largely sold in pots for indoor use. The major flowering plants are poinsettias, orchids, florist chrysanthemums, and finished florist azaleas. Foliage plants are also sold in pots and hanging baskets for indoor and patio use, including larger specimens for office, hotel, and restaurant interiors. Cut flowers are usually sold in bunches or as bouquets with cut foliage. The production of cut flowers is specifically known as the cut flower industry. Farming flowers and foliage employs special aspects of floriculture, such as spacing, training and pruning plants for optimal flower harvest; and post-harvest treatment such as chemical treatments, storage, preservation and packaging. In Australia and the United States some species are harvested from the wild for the cut flower market.

The stand, which still exists today, sold hamburgers and hot dogs topped with chili. At first business was slow, but it soon started to pick up. During the 1960s, the entire lot at this intersection was purchased. Soon after, the northwest corner was acquired for expanded parking and storage of goods. Not long after that, a second service counter occupying the building at the perimeter of the northeast lot was set up. The food was essentially the same from both locations, except for longer lines at the original shack counter, perhaps for nostalgic reasons. Tommy's grew to 30 locations by 2006. Most Original Tommy's restaurants are found in the Greater Los Angeles Area. In recent years several locations have closed. The Santa Monica location was closed on April 20, 2014 when the landlord refused to renew the lease and leased the location to Starbucks instead.

It is based on the R-29R designed by State Rocket Center Makayev and related to the Shtil' Launch Vehicle . The Volna is a 3-stage launch vehicle that uses liquid propellant. The warhead section is used for the payloads that can be either put into orbit with the help of an additional boost engine or travel along a sub-orbital trajectory to be recovered at the landing site. Volna can be launched from Delta III-class submarine or from land based facilities. Performance Because of its mobile launch platform the Volna launch vehicle can reach a large number of different inclinations and could increase its performance to low Earth orbit by launching from equatorial sites. All flights to date have taken place from the Barents Sea. From this site the Volna can lift 100 kg into a 400 km high orbit with an inclination of 79 degrees. The warhead section can accommodate a payload of up to 1.3 m3. For sub-orbital missions the payload can be either a recoverable vehicle of up to 720 kg or research equipment placed in a descent vehicle of up to 400 kg. Launch history *The first launch of the Volna took place at June 6, 1995 on a suborbital trajectory. The payload of this flight was a thermal-convectional Earth model developed by Bremen University (Germany). *On 20 July 2001 the second flight took place with a simplified (two-bladed) test vehicle of the Cosmos 1 solar sail of the Planetary Society and an inflatable re-entry heat shield. The Volna was launched from Delta III Submarine Borisoglebsk in the Barents Sea. Although the launch vehicle reached the intended suborbital trajectory the spacecraft failed to separate. The separation command was not issued by the flight software because of the presence of non-nominal variations. Failure of the Cosmos-1 to separate also resulted in the loss of the secondary payload, a new inflatable re-entry vehicle. *On 12 July 2002 the Volna was used for a sub-orbital flight for a second attempt to test a new re-entry vehicle, IRDT-2. The launch took place from Delta III class submarine K-44 Ryazan. Due to a failure in the launcher/payload interface the vehicle was lost and did not land on the expected area on the Kamchatka peninsula. It is unclear whether the spacecraft separated from the third stage of the Volna and did not inflate correctly or that it remained attached to the payload module.

Much of Atwater Village lies in the fertile Los Angeles River flood plain. Located in the northeast region of the city, Atwater borders Griffith Park and Silver Lake to the west, Glendale to the north and east, and Glassell Park to the south. Basically the eastern boundary is the Railroad tracks (Originally, the Southern Pacific) The area has three elementary schools‚Äîtwo public and one private. Almost half the residents were born abroad, a high percentage for the city of Los Angeles. History 1927 photo showing historic Glendale‚ÄìHyperion Bridge connecting Silverlake and Atwater Village. Much of Northeastern Los Angeles was part of Rancho San Rafael, until 1868, when parts of it were purchased by W.C.B. Richardson, who renamed it Rancho Santa Eulalia. The entire region was subdivided and sold to home builders in 1902, with the Atwater Village portion being named as such due to its proximity to the Los Angeles River. The area was initially named \\"Atwater,\\" while the \\"Village\\" was added in 1986. Initial residents included the newly created middle-class workers employed at the nearby DWP substation. The location between the Los Angeles and Glendale city cores made it a highly sought after residential neighborhood beginning in the 1920s. The majority of homes and structures in Atwater Village have never been demolished (although many have changed in use or have been renovated), resulting in the neighborhood having one of the highest number of structures built before 1939 in Los Angeles County. Today, the neighborhood is among Los Angeles' most rapidly gentrifying, with an influx of young creative professionals (sometimes called \\"hipsters\\") and businesses catering to them, spilling over from the popular Silver Lake and Los Feliz areas. Population =2013 findings= Census tracts 1883, 1881 and 1871.01 lie wholly within Atwater Village boundaries, and a large portion of census tract 1871.02 is also within Atwater Village. Here are the five-year findings as reported by American Community Survey in 2013: Census tract 1883 had a median income of $31,111 and was 37.8% non-Hispanic white, 34.1% Hispanic, 20.2% Asian, 1.6% Pacific Islander and 1.1% black. Census tract 1871.01 had a median income of $72,526 and was 42.9% non-Hispanic white, 34.4% Hispanic, 21.2% Asian and 1.4% black. Census tract 1881 was 60.3% Hispanic, 23.9% non-Hispanic white, 13.2% Asian, 2% black and 1.3% American Indian or Alaska Native. Median income for this census tract was $30,996. Census tract 1871.02 was 47.9% Hispanic, 27.5% non-Hispanic white, 13.9% Asian and 8.4% black, with a median income of $24,852. =2008 estimate= In 2008, the city estimated that 15,455 people lived in Atwater Village. =2000 census= The 2000 U.S. census counted 14,888 residents in the 1.78-square-mile Atwater Village neighborhood‚Äîor 8,379 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. The median age for residents was 34, about average for the city. The neighborhood was considered highly diverse ethnically, with a high percentage of Asians. The breakdown was Latinos, 51.3%; whites, 22.2%; Asians, 19.7%; blacks, 1.4%; and others, 5.4%. Mexico (27.2%) and the Philippines (20.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 49.3% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîa high percentage, compared to the city at large. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $53,872, an average figure for Los Angeles. The percentages of households that earned $20,000 to $60,000 yearly were high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 2.7 people was average for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 59.6% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners held 40.4%. The percentage of never-married women was among the county's highest. Geography Much of Atwater lies in the old Los Angeles River flood plain, which resulted in deep, fertile soil.\\"Future looks brighter in urban Atwater\\", LA Times, May 25, 2003 According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Atwater Village is bordered on the north and east by Glendale, on the southeast by Glassell Park, on the south by Echo Park, on the southwest by Los Feliz and Silver Lake and on the west by Griffith Park. Street and other boundary limits are the Ventura Freeway on the north, San Fernando Boulevard on the east, and the Los Angeles River on the south and west. Education Twenty-two percent of Atwater Park residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for both the city and the county.

Mount Sinai is the main hospital of the Sinai Health System, although it is linked by bridges and tunnels to three adjacent hospitals of the University Health Network (Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre). During the 2005 annual charity, the hospital reported to the Canada Revenue Agency as having assets of roughly C$ 520 million. Mount Sinai Hospital has existed in Toronto since 1923 under various names; it has occupied its present site on University Avenue since 1953. In the fiscal year ending March 2013, Mount Sinai Hospital cared for 128,714 inpatients days, delivered almost 7000 babies and performed almost 20,000 surgeries. Toronto and area residents made more than half a million ambulatory clinic visits to Mount Sinai. In that same year, the hospital‚Äôs Schwartz/Reisman Emergency Department saw 56,080 visits and that number is expected to increase to 80,000 per year over the next few years.Mount Sinai Hospital‚Äôs Report to the Community 2012/2013 More than 600 staff work at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai's research facility.

During the August of that year, the Society began a fundraising campaign to establish a hospital, spearheaded by four immigrant women: Mrs. Cohn, Mrs. Miller, Mrs. Spiegel and Mrs. Adler. In 1922, a location at 100 Yorkville Avenue was purchased with $12,000. The two-storey building was built as a private residence in 1871 by James D. Bridgland, the Crown's Inspector of Roads; in 1914, the home was converted into the Lyndhurst Private Hospital. Dorothy Dworkin (seated in the centre) with members of the Mount Sinai Hospital Ladies Auxiliary, Toronto, circa 1923. In 1923, the hospital opened and was named \\"The Hebrew Maternity and Convalescent Hospital\\". Dorothy Dworkin, who helped in the fundraising campaign, became president of the institution. The first list of permanent staff included: a nursing superintendent, four graduate and two undergraduate nurses, a cook, a laundress, a housemaid and a janitor, while the 33 Jewish doctors in the city all volunteered some time. In 1924, the name was changed to Mount Sinai Hospital. In 1930, a new surgical wing was begun by architects, Kaminker & Richmond. The original designs were drawn up in 1928 by Benjamin Swartz. The project was only completed in 1934. In 1943, a new site was purchased on University Avenue at the corner of Gerrard Street. In 1953, it opened. In the same year, the original Mount Sinai Hospital became the St. Raphael's Nursing Home. In 1985, the original property was designated as a site of historical significance by the Toronto Historical Board Despite this, the 1930 wing was partially demolished in 1988. (Heritage Toronto). In 2015, Mount Sinai Hospital, Bridgepoint Health, and Circle of Care joined in a voluntary amalgamation to create the Sinai Health System, which has the goal of creating an integrated health system that provides more efficient, coordinated care for patients. At the time of its founding, Mount Sinai Hospital was the only hospital to offer kosher food in Canada. Indeed, it was an institution where Jewish patients could communicate in Yiddish, and be able to observe their religious practices. The hospital has continued to be an institution to provide culturally appropriate services to the Jewish community alongside other immigrant and non-English speaking communities.Mount Sinai Website Retrieved August 17, 2010 Today, Mount Sinai has one of the most vibrant volunteer programs in Canada.

While the genre is targeted to adolescents, approximately half of YA readers are adults. The subject matter and genres of YA correlate with the age and experience of the protagonist. The genres available in YA are expansive and include most of those found in adult fiction. Common themes related to YA include friendship, first love, relationships, and identity. Stories that focus on the specific challenges of youth are sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming-of-age novels.Lamb, Nancy, Crafting Stories for Children. Cincinnati: Writer's Digest Books, p. 24 Young adult fiction was developed to soften the transition between children's novels and adult literature. History =Beginning= Title page from Sarah Trimmer's The Guardian of Education, vol. I, 1802 The history of young adult literature is tied to the history of how childhood and young adulthood has been perceived. One early writer to recognize young adults as a distinct group was Sarah Trimmer, who, in 1802, described \\"young adulthood\\" as lasting from ages 14 to 21. In her children's literature periodical, The Guardian of Education, Trimmer introduced the terms \\"Books for Children\\" (for those under fourteen) and \\"Books for Young Persons\\" (for those between fourteen and twenty-one), establishing terms of reference for young adult literature that still remains in use. Nineteenth and early twentieth century authors presents several early works, that appealed to young readers, though not necessarily written for them such as Lewis Carroll, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Francis Hodgson Burnett, Edith Nesbit, JM Barrie, L. Frank Baum, Astrid Lindgren, Enid Blyton, CS Lewis.Susan Broomhall, Joanne McEwan, Stephanie Tarbin. \\"Once upon a time: a brief history of children‚Äôs literature\\", The Conversation (website), May 28, 2017 =20th century= In the 1950s, The Catcher in the Rye (1951), attracted the attention of the adolescent demographic although it was written for adults. The themes of adolescent angst and alienation in the novel have become synonymous with young adult literature. The modern classification of young- adult fiction originated during the 1960s, after the publication of S. E. Hinton's The Outsiders (1967). The novel features a truer, darker side of adolescent life that was not often represented in works of fiction of the time, and was the first novel published specifically marketed for young adults as Hinton was one when she wrote it.Jon Michaud, \\"S. E. Hinton and the Y.A. Debate\\", The New Yorker, October 14, 2014Constance Grady,\\"The Outsiders reinvented young adult fiction. Harry Potter made it inescapable.,\\" Vox (website), January 26, 2017 Written during high-school and published when Hinton was only 16, The Outsiders also lacked the nostalgic tone common in books about adolescents written by adults.Dale Peck, 'The Outsiders': 40 Years Later, New York Times, 23 September 2007 The Outsiders remains one of the best-selling young adult novels of all time. The 1960s became the era \\"when the 'under 30' generation became a subject of popular concern, and research on adolescence began to emerge. It was also the decade when literature for adolescents could be said to have come into its own\\".Cart, p. 43, This increased the discussions about adolescent experiences and the new idea of adolescent authors. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, what has come to be known as the \\"fab five\\"Cart, p. 77. were published: I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), an autobiography of the early years of American poet Maya Angelou; The Friends (1973) by Rosa Guy; the semi-autobiographical The Bell Jar (US 1963, under a pseudonym; UK 1967) by poet Sylvia Plath; Bless the Beasts and Children (1970) by Glendon Swarthout; and Deathwatch (1972) by Robb White, which was awarded 1973 Edgar Award for Best Juvenile Mystery by the Mystery Writers of America. The works of Angelou, Guy, and Plath were not written for young readers. As publishers began to focus on the emerging adolescent market, booksellers and libraries began creating young adult sections distinct from children's literature and novels written for adults. The 1970s to the mid-1980s have been described as the golden age of young- adult fiction, when challenging novels began speaking directly to the interests of the identified adolescent market. In the 1980s, young adult literature began pushing the envelope in terms of the subject matter that was considered appropriate for their audience: Books dealing with topics such as rape, suicide, parental death, and murder which had previously been deemed taboo, saw significant critical and commercial success. A flip-side of this trend was a strong revived interest in the romance novel, including young adult romance. With an increase in number of teenagers the genre \\"matured, blossomed, and came into its own, with the better written, more serious, and more varied young adult books (than those) published during the last two decades\\".Tomlinson and Lynch-Brown, p. 5. The first novel in J.K. Rowling's seven-book Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. The series was praised for its complexity and maturity, and attracted a wide adult audience. While not technically YA, its success led many to see Harry Potter and its author, J.K. Rowling, as responsible for a resurgence of young adult literature, and re-established the pre-eminent role of speculative fiction in the field, a trend further solidified by The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The end of the decade saw a number of awards appear such as the Michael L. Printz Award and Alex Awards, designed to recognize excellence in writing for young adult audiences. The category of young adult fiction continues to expand into other media and genres: graphic novels/manga, light novels, fantasy, mystery fiction, romance novels, and even subcategories such as cyberpunk, techno-thrillers, and contemporary Christian fiction. =21st century= Since about 2017, issues related to diversity and sensitivity in English-language young adult fiction have become increasingly contentious. Fans frequently criticize authors ‚Äì including those who themselves belong to minorities ‚Äì for \\"appropriating\\" or wrongly portraying the experiences of minority or disadvantaged groups. Publishers have withdrawn several planned young adult novels from publication after they met with pushback on these grounds from readers on websites such as Goodreads. Authors have reported harassment, demands to cease writing, and death threats over social media. To prevent offending readers, publishers increasingly, though with mixed success, employ \\"sensitivity readers\\" to screen texts for material that could cause offense.  Themes  Many young adult novels feature coming- of-age stories. These feature adolescents beginning to transform into adults, working through personal problems, and learning to take responsibility for their actions. YA serves many literary purposes. It provides a pleasurable reading experience for young people, emphasizing real-life experiences and problems in easier-to-grasp ways, and depicts societal functions. An analysis of YA novels between 1980 and 2000 found seventeen expansive literary themes. The most common of these were friendship, getting into trouble, romantic and sexual interest, and family life. Other common thematic elements revolve around the coming-of-age nature of the texts. This includes narratives about self-identity, life and death, and individuality.  Genre  There are no distinguishable differences in genre styles between YA fiction and adult fiction. Some of the most common YA genres include contemporary fiction, fantasy, romance, and dystopian. Genre-blending, which is the combination of multiple genres into one work, is also common in YA. =New adult fiction= New adult fiction (also known as NA) is a genre, generally written about and aimed towards young adults between 18 and 30 years old. Many publishers specifically target the genre towards the 18 to 24 age range. The term \\"new adult\\" was popularized in 2009 when St. Martin's Press ran a contest requesting stories about \\"a sort of older YA or new adult.\\" There are some disparities in defining new adult, but it generally focuses on characters exploring the challenges of adult life. Common themes include: relationships, college life, self-identity, new responsibilities, and issues like abuse. Often, new adult is seen as a subcategory of romance as many books feature themes like sexual exploration. Critics of the new adult genre claim that the terminology is condescending because it implies that readers need \\"training wheels\\" before reading adult fiction. It is believed that New Adult bridges the gap between Young Adult and Adult Fiction by detailing how to adjust to life after adolescence. Popular new adult authors include Jennifer L. Armentrout, Jamie McGuire, Colleen Hoover and Tammara Webber. = Problem novels = \\"Social-problem\\" novels or problem novels are a sub-genre of literature focusing and commenting on overarching social problems. They are typically a type of realistic fiction that characteristically depict contemporary issues such as poverty, drugs, and pregnancy. Published in 1967, S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders is often credited as the first problem novel. Following this release, problem novels were popularized and dominated during the 1970s. Sheila Egoff described three reasons why problem novels resonate with adolescents: * They depict real situations that the readers are experiencing so they have \\"therapeutic value\\" * They are interesting, new and foreign to those not experiencing these issues, * They feature mature story lines which appeal to a child's desire to grow up. A classic example of a problem novel and one that defined the sub-genre is Go Ask Alice by Anonymous (pseudonym for Beatrice Sparks) published in 1971. Go Ask Alice is written in first-person as the diary of a young girl who experiences a lot of problems while growing up. In order to cope with her problems, the protagonist begins experimenting with drugs. Modern examples of problem novels include Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson, Crank by Ellen Hopkins, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. =Boundaries between children's, young adult, and adult fiction= The distinctions among children's literature, young adult literature, and adult literature have historically been flexible and loosely defined. This line is often policed by adults who feel strongly about the border.Richard Flynn, Boundary Issues, Children's Literature Association Quarterly, Volume 33, Number 2, Summer 2008 At the lower end of the age spectrum, fiction targeted to readers age 8-12 is referred to as middle-grade fiction. Some novels originally marketed to adults are of interest and value to adolescents, and vice versa, as in the case of books such as the Harry Potter series of novels. Some examples of middle grade novels and novel series include the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series by Rick Riordan, The Underland Chronicles by Suzanne Collins, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney. Some examples of young adult novels and novel series include the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Middle grade novels are typically for the ages of 8‚Äì12. They tend to have an ATOS level of 5.0 or below, have a smaller word count, and are significantly less mature and complex in theme and content than YA, NA, or adult fiction. Young adult novels are for the ages of 12‚Äì18. They tend to have an ATOS level of 5.0 or above, have a larger word count, and tackle more mature and adult themes and content. Middle grade novels usually feature protagonists under the age of 13, whereas young adult novels usually feature protagonists within the age range of 12‚Äì18. Uses in the classroom Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books YA has been integrated into classrooms to increase student interest in reading. There is a common misconception that YA lit is solely for \\"struggling\\" or \\"reluctant\\" readers and should be reserved for remedial classes. Studies have shown that YA can be beneficial in classroom settings. YA fiction is written for young adults and so it is often more relevant to students' social and emotional needs than is classic literature. Use of YA in classrooms is linked to: * higher levels of engagement and motivation among students * increased levels of self-confidence, personal development and self- identification * increased desire to read similar books Students who read YA are more likely to appreciate literature and have stronger reading skills than others. YA also allows teachers to talk about \\"taboo\\" or difficult topics with their students. For example, a 2014 study shows that using Laurie Halse Anderson's novel Speak aided in discussions on consent and complicity. Those who read about tough situations like date rape are more emotionally prepared to handle the situation if it arises. It is important to use diverse literature in the classroom, especially in discussing taboo topics, to avoid excluding minority students. Literature written for young adults can also be used as a stepping stone to canonical works that are traditionally read in classrooms, and required by many school curriculums. In Building a Culture of Readers: YA Literature and the Canon by Kara Lycke, Lycke suggests pairing young adult literature and canon works to prepare young adults to understand the classic literature they will encounter. YA can provide familiar and less alienating examples of similar concepts than those in classic literature. Suggested pairings include Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series with the Iliad or the Odyssey, or Stephenie Meyer's Twilight with Wuthering Heights. When discussing identity, Lycke suggests pairing Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter with Sherman Alexie's The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian.  Diversity  English language young adult fiction and children's literature in general have historically shown a lack of books with a main character who is a person of color, LGBT, or disabled. In the UK 90% of the best-selling YA titles from 2006 to 2016 featured white, able-bodied, cis-gendered, and heterosexual main characters. The numbers of children's book authors have shown a similar lack of diversity. Between 2006‚Äì2016, eight percent of all young adult authors published in the UK were people of color. Diversity is considered beneficial since it encourages children of diverse backgrounds to read and it teaches children of all backgrounds an accurate view of the world around them. In the mid-2010s, more attention was drawn to this problem from various quarters. In the several years following, diversity numbers seem to have improved: One survey showed that in 2017, a quarter of children's books were about minority protagonists, almost a 10% increase from 2016.

Life  Dodoens was born Rembert van Joenckema in Mechelen, a town between Antwerp and Brussels and capital of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1517 to Denis Van Joenckema (d. 1533) and Ursula Roelants. The van Joenckema family and name were Frisian in origin. In Friesland they were active in politics and jurisprudence, and in 1516 moved to Mechelen. His father was one of the municipal physicians in Mechelen and had been one of the private physicians to Margaret of Austria, Governor of the Netherlands, in her final illness, whose court was based in Mechelen. Rembert later changed his last name to Dodoens (literally \\"Son of Dodo\\", a form of his father's name, Denis or Doede). He was educated at the municipal college in Mechelen before beginning his studies in medicine, cosmography and geography at the age of 13 at the University of Leuven (Louvain), under Arnold Noot, Leonard Willemaer, Jean Heems, and Paul Roelswhere. He graduated with a licentiate in medicine in 1535, and as was the custom of the time, began extensive travels (Wanderjahren) in Europe till 1546, including Italy, Germany, and France. In 1539 he married Kathelijne De Bruyn (1517‚Äì1572), who came from a medical family in Mechelen. With her he had four children, Ursula (b. 1544), Denijs (b. 1548), Antonia and Rembert Dodoens. He had a short stay in Basel (1542‚Äì1546). In 1557, Dodoens turned down a chair at the University of Leuven. He also turned down an offer to become court physician of king Philip II of Spain. After his wife's death at the age of 55 in 1572, he married Maria Saerinen by whom he had a daughter, Johanna. He died in Leiden in 1585, and was buried at Pieterskerk, Leiden.  Work  Ghent University Library. After graduation, he eventually established himself as one of the three municipal physicians in Mechelen, as his father had been, together with Joachim Roelandts and Jacob De Moor, in 1548. He became the court physician of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian II, and his successor, Austrian emperor Rudolph II in Vienna (1575‚Äì1578). In 1582, he finally became professor in medicine at the University of Leiden in 1582. = Life and times = At the opening of the sixteenth century the general belief was that the plant world had been completely described by Dioscorides, in his De Materia Medica. During Dodoens' lifetime, botanical knowledge was undergoing enormous expansion, partly fueled by the expansion of the known plant world by New World exploration, the discovery of printing and the use of wood-block illustration. This period is thought of as a botanical Renaissance. Europe became engrossed with natural history from the 1530s, and gardening and cultivation of plants became a passion and prestigious pursuit from monarchs to universities. The first botanical gardens appeared as well as the first illustrated botanical encyclopaedias, together with thousands of watercolours and woodcuts. The experience of farmers, gardeners, foresters, apothecaries and physicians was being supplemented by the rise of the plant expert. Collecting became a discipline, specifically the Kunst- und Wunderkammern (cabinets of curiosities) outside of Italy and the study of naturalia became widespread through many social strata. The great botanists of the sixteenth century were all, like Dodoens, originally trained as physicians, who pursued a knowledge of plants not just for medicinal properties, but in their own right. Chairs in botany, within medical faculties were being established in European universities throughout the sixteenth century in reaction to this trend, and the scientific approach of observation, documentation and experimentation was being applied to the study of plants. Otto Brunfels published his Herbarium in 1530, followed by those of Jerome Bock (1539) and Leonhard Fuchs (1542), men that Kurt Sprengel would later call the ‚ÄúGerman fathers of botany‚Äù. These men all influenced Dodoens, who was their successor.  Publications  Dodoens' initial work was in the fields of cosmography and physiology. His De frugum historia (1552), a treatise on cereals, vegetables, and fodders marked the beginning of a distinguished career in botany, and his herbal Cruydeboeck (herb book) with 715 images (1554, 1563) was influenced by earlier German botanists, particularly that of Leonhart Fuchs. Rather than the traditional method of arranging the plants in alphabetical order, he divided the plant kingdom into six groups (Deel), based on their properties and affinities. It treated in detail especially the medicinal herbs, which made this work, in the eyes of many, a pharmacopoeia. This work and its various editions and translations became one of the most important botanical works of the late 16th century, part of its popularity being his use of the vernacular rather than the commonly used Latin. Cruydeboeck was translated first into French in 1557 by Charles de L'Ecluse (Histoire des Plantes), and into English (via L'Ecluse) in 1578 by Henry Lyte (A new herbal, or historie of plants), and later into Latin in 1583 (Stirpium historiae pemptades sex). The English version became a standard work in that language. In his times, it was the most translated book after the Bible. It became a work of worldwide renown, used as a reference book for two centuries. His Latin translation of 1583, the Stirpium or Pemtdades, was also a considerable revision, adding new families, enlarging the number of groups from 6 to 26 and including many new illustrations, both original and borrowed. It was used by John Gerard as the source for his widely used Herball (1597). Thomas Johnson, in his preface to his 1633 edition of Herball, explains the controversial use of Dodoens' work by Gerard. = List of selected publications = Title page of Crvydt-Boeck (1644 ed.) see  ** (1584) De sphaera sive de astronomiae et geographiae principiis cosmographica isagoge.

Enrico Forlanini (13 December 1848 ‚Äì 9 October 1930) was an Italian engineer, inventor and aeronautical pioneer, known for his works on helicopters, aircraft, hydrofoils and dirigibles. He was born in Milan. His older brother Carlo Forlanini was a physician. Early life Experimental helicopter by Enrico Forlanini (1877), exposed at the Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci of Milan Enrico was born to Francesco Forlanini, a notable physician and director of the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli in Milan. After elementary school he attended one of the three Milan Regie Scuole Tecniche, in 1863 he entered the Military College of Turin. In 1866 he enrolled at the Military Academy of Turin, and become a Lieutenant of Engineers. Enrico enrolled in the Scuola di Applicazione Artiglieria e Genio (Application School of Artillery and Engineers) in Turin in 1868. Upon graduation in 1870, he was assigned to Casale Monferrato, where he was able to work in the police station's workshop. He began working on a systematic testing of propellers. He subsequently studied at Politecnico di Milano and graduated in Industrial Engineering. Helicopter model In 1877, he developed an early helicopter powered by a steam engine. It was the first of its type that rose to a height of 13 meters, where it remained for some 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off from a park in Milan.Biografie - Enrico Forlanini Industry Then, he worked in Forl√¨, in a society named Societ√† Anonima Forlivese per l‚Äôilluminazione a gas e per la fonderia di ferro. Airships Later he designed and built a series of dirigibles, notably, designed in 1901 and launched in 1909, the Leonardo da Vinci that he dedicated to the famous Renaissance inventor and, in 1912, the Citt√† di Milano, dedicated to his beloved home town. The latter showed exceptionally good characteristics of stability and controllability that won Forlanini international renown.New York Times 1918 A further four airships were constructed: F3, F4, F5 and F6. A seventh, named Omnia Dir was only completed after his death. Hydrofoils Forlanini hydrofoil on Lake Maggiore circa 1911 He is also known for his hydrofoils that he started modelling since 1898. One of those, built at full scale, used a ladder system of foils and a engine driving two counter-rotating air props. During testing on Lake Maggiore in 1906, this craft reached a top speed of 68 km/h (42.5 mph). He also tested a hydrofoil with a steam engine but this only achieved around in 1908-1909.Brozzola Legacy Forlanini obtained a number of British and American patents on his ideas and designs, most of which were aimed at seaplane applications.International Hydrofoil Society. Forlanini , last accessed 2008-06-30 He died in 1930 while still working on the design of the Omnia Dir airship. Milan has dedicated to him its city airport, also named Linate Airport, as well as the nearby park, the Parco Forlanini. He also has an avenue named after him. Notes References *Diego Brozzola. 1999.

In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40,000, the Orks are a race of aliens and a playable army in the tabletop miniatures wargame. Alongside the Space Marines, Orks are one of the most iconic elements of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Orks revel in violence for its own sake; their entire culture revolves around warfare. They are one of the oldest, most widespread and persistent of the Imperium's enemies and even outnumber the quadrillions strong humanity as a species, making them the most numerous species in the galaxy. Their simplistic personalities, reckless tactics and ramshackle technology make them the comic relief characters of the setting.  Tabletop game mechanics The Orks are oriented towards melee combat; their ranged units are rather weak. Most of their units have weak armour and are thus easy to kill, but they are cheap and thus can make up for this weakness with numbers. A favourite strategy is \\"the Green Tide\\": the player fields as many Orks as they can and simply marches them across the playing field to overwhelm or swarm his opponent. Orks do have a number of specialised units who can use psychic powers and attack vehicles (among other things), but typically Ork warfare is about brute force and attrition. Ork gameplay is viewed as being fairly forgiving of tactical errors or bad dice rolls.  Appearance  The general appearance of Warhammer 40k orks is fairly typical of other orcs; they have a large-boxy build with varying shades of green skin. Much like other races of Warhammer 40k, the Orks are divided into divergent armies with their own colour schemes, background, and play-style. For the orks, these armies are called \\"clans\\". Some examples include the \\"Goffs\\" Clan with black and white colours (sometimes in a checkered pattern) with splashes of red and a preference (by background) for melee combat; another clan is the \\"Evil Sunz\\" that features a red and yellow colour scheme and has a preference for using bikers and vehicles while \\"Bad Moons \\" smother their armour in bright yellow. Some Bad Moonz, who are stricken with wanderlust, or have more teef (the monetary system used by Orks) than they know what to do with, become Freebootas, which wear eccentric outfits, and travel the stars in Space 'Ulks, or Kroozas, which are space ships, mostly stolen Imperial ships. They mostly take on the appearance of Pirates. In addition to the clan colours, some players will also paint the faces of their ork armies blue in a \\"Woad\\" fashion (due to the ork belief that blue is a lucky colour). While these colours are mainly aesthetic, the ork codex does feature some rules such as \\"Da red wunz go fasta!\\" and it is required that ork vehicles with this upgrade actually feature red paint. With the exception of army colours, ork armies are largely green with varying shades of hair colours and teeth. Color schemes for orks are typically very rough and sloppy with much \\"rust\\" and \\"dirt\\" colouring's. Ork technology is sometimes referred to as \\"junkyard\\" tech. This is mainly due to orky armour/structures/vehicles having a \\"thrown-together\\" look to them. Ork body armor takes the form of bulky and ill-fitting metal plates being crudely strapped to its user, along with spikes or emblems to make the wearer appear more ferocious. Ork vehicles also carry the theme. These typically look as modern-day industrial vehicles would had they been found in a junk yard, rebuilt with scrap iron/corrugated metal/wooden 2x4's/metal rivets, had various (and seemingly random) weapons attached and made to function (poorly).  Physiology  In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40k, Orks are green-skinned, a side effect of their blending on a genetic level with fungi and photosynthetic organisms (essentially being enormously complex lichens). Orks are genetically engineered for combat. They are extremely strong and immensely resilient, fortunate due to their lifestyle of constant warfare and primitive medical technology and techniques. Orks live for combat, and regard fighting as the highest form of worship for their (largely indistinguishable) gods, Gork and Mork. Orks are generally indifferent as to whom they fight, being as content to fight one another as any of the various other races inhabiting the Warhammer galaxy. As such, Orks are extremely disorganised and fractious. They eat fungi of all kinds as well as meat, whether the source is sapient or not. A particularly favoured ingredient in their diet are the squigs, a small organism closely related to Orks in biological terms. Squigs are comparable to two legged mouths, and are often coloured red. Most such animals are used for food or in other domestic applications (to the extent that Orks have a domestic sphere), but some particularly vicious varieties have applications in combat, mainly as attack dogs or living grenades. The only other major form of squig are the elephantine (or even larger) squiggoths. Particularly large examples are used as mobile fortresses, while smaller such beasts serve as pack animals. Orks grow all through their lives, though the average Ork stands around the same height as the average man, at least given their almost perpetual slouch, meaning that, at full height, they would be much taller than a person. This typical pose gives them the appearance of a large, green gorilla. Orks grow at greatly varying rates, however, dependent on social conditions. The effect is notable in extremely aggressive Orks, which tend to grow much faster, for several reasons. First, due to the extremely peculiar nature of Ork physiology, social structure, and their unique psychic gestalt, as an Ork survives combat and wins trophies, the respect of other Orks will produce in him an effect somewhat similar to adolescence in the human male: he puts on muscle, becomes more aggressive and assertive. If an Ork continues to be successful, gaining more respect, he may become a Nob (short for \\"noble,\\" but pronounced \\"knob\\"), a leader of Orks, noticeably larger, tougher, stronger and of a darker green than the average specimen. Once he begins to grow, an Ork will generally keep getting bigger, stronger, and greener until another Ork defeats him, by whatever means. This indicates that the effects of adolescence in Orks continue indefinitely, but can be triggered on or off by defeat or success. However, the means by which Orks become greener is apparently not rooted in their physiology, but in their role as the comic relief in the setting. Orks achieve their theoretical pinnacle, socially at least, when a Nob becomes a Warboss or a Warlord, the rulers of continents and empires. Such creatures are exceptionally large, often standing over three meters (10') tall or higher, with the most powerful known to reach up to twice that height. And although they have achieved the highest possible rank at this point, as previously indicated, they continue to grow and become ever greener, until they are almost black. In the extremely unlikely event that they are not killed in any number of gruesome and/or implausibly humorous ways, an Ork will live indefinitely. Orks seem to live longer the more powerful they are, with some truly legendary Warbosses rumoured to be hundreds of years old. It seems Ork Warbosses are, in general, possessed of great longevity, again, assuming the extreme danger of Ork lifestyle and society (not to mention the constant warfare) does not kill them. The process causing this is unknown, but most likely another remnant of the initial genetic manipulation which created the Orks, perhaps with the intention of creating a recognisable and permanent leadership base for the Orks. Retirement is nonexistent in Ork society. Orks' brutish behaviour and choice to always use a direct approach in combat stems from their lack of a fear of death. They lack a traditional central nervous system found in most mammals and reptiles, a strength built into the Orks during their creation long ago as weapons in a great ancient war. Their cross- breeding with fungi allows them to reproduce asexually, which explains the lack of Ork females. This reproductive process basically involves the dispersion of spores from a decomposing Ork corpse, such that killing an Ork literally creates more Orks, which also explains why Orks are so difficult to fight and more so eradicate, and how they are able to infiltrate and build up large populations virtually anywhere imaginable from barren deserts to lush jungles, to iron glass and stone cities. The only known solution to this problem is to incinerate the entire area, or failing that the entire planet to destroy all Orks and Ork spores. Because Orks are so genetically similar to plants and fungi, their diets are flexible in the absolute extreme - Orks, and to that extent all Orkoids can be used not only as meat, but also as yeast and phytochemical-containing fibrous plantlike sides. The 'Orkoid Pie' is a staple of Ork diets, particularly on the battlefield, where little other food is available, and dead Orkoids are in abundance. Language Orks use a modified form of Low Gothic (the language of the human Imperium 40 millennia in the future, represented for gamers by the English language), in which phonetic misspellings such as \\"kannon\\", \\"choppa\\", and \\"boyz\\" are commonly utilised in lieu of standard spelling. This seeming ignorance belies the species' evolutionarily advantageous ability to adapt the existing tools of others, be they tropes or tanks, to their own unique usage. In some depictions, Orks have their own distinct language, which is described as guttural, grunting, and involving plenty of physical violence. In these depictions, most characters don't comprehend their language, and sometimes assume they don't have one capable of communicating complex ideas at all. Culture Ork culture circulates around seemingly random violence, which dominates every aspect of their culture. However, to characterise it as evil, malicious, or racist is to ignore the fact that it is in their nature. Most competitive activities amongst fellow Orks end in death. In fact, most activities Orks engage in involve death. Their culture (when not fighting each other) is mainly reminiscent of tribal methods, with a crude understanding of trade and commerce (although comically, their currency is said to be the teeth knocked out of each other in brawls). Ork behaviour is dominated by the WAAAAAGH!, a gestalt psychic field they generate that affects the Ork psyche, as it allows Orks to instinctively recognise who is 'bigga' and therefore in charge, which also feeds into the physiological expressions of success. All Orks generate this field, and it grows stronger as the Orks enjoy themselves, generally while fighting. The WAAAAAGH! helps give momentum (and the name) to the Orks' planet-crushing WAAAAAGH!s. These WAAAAAGH!s are a cross between a mass migration, holy war, looting party and pub brawl, with a bit of genocide thrown in for good measure. Millions of Orks will gather together, drawn to the power of a single dominant Ork called a Warboss, who are essentially extremely successful Ork Nobs, distinguished from most Nobs thanks to their higher level of intelligence, many qualifying as geniuses even by human standards (which is not to say that Warbosses are always intelligent; some are simply too big, too green, and too strong to be resisted), though their lack of education can often lead their enemies to assume their stupidity (which is usually the last mistake they make). Once assembled into a huge mass, consisting of hundreds of millions or even billions of Orks and their countless ramshackle vehicles and spacecraft, the Orks will set off to find an enemy to fight. Ork WAAAAGH!s will sweep whole planetary systems away and destroy armies and fleets in tides of bloodlust and carnage, and only once the Orks have killed every available enemy will they start to fight amongst themselves again. \\"The Orks are the pinnacle of creation. For them, the great struggle is won. They have evolved a society which knows no stress or angst. Who are we to judge them? We Eldar who have failed, or the Humans, on the road to ruin in their turn. And why? Because we sought answers to questions that an Ork wouldn't even bother to ask. We see a culture that is strong and despise it as crude.\\" \\\\- From Culture vs. Kultur: Thoughts on Orkish Society by Uthan the Perverse, a controversial Eldar philosopher. Weapons Orks prefer close combat weapons as they are represented in-game as being terrible marksmen, which they compensate for by building comically powerful guns, which are often manned, again for humorous effect, by the weedy Grots or Gretchin who are portrayed as being slightly better handlers of ballistic weapons than their bigger cousins, having a similar proficiency as an average human Imperial Guardsman. The Ork WAAAGH gestalt also works on their equipment. Aside from allowing Orks to form some form of hierarchy, this gestalt psychic field allows slapped-together weapons, vehicles, spacecraft, and aircraft to function when, according to all laws of physics, they should explode, fall apart or simply not work- for example, when a human or Eldar attempts to fire an Ork gun, it usually explodes. In the same way, the generalised Ork belief that vehicles or aircraft painted or otherwise coloured red have higher top speeds than those painted or coloured otherwise ('da red wunz go fasta!') actually results in measurably higher top speeds for Ork vehicles painted red. It is theorised by fans that at some point in the past, orks built two vehicles that were identical in their eyes, save for some internal difference that resulted in the red painted one going faster. This effect can be included in the game, with an Ork player using 5 army points to buy a \\"Red Paint Job\\" for any vehicle, giving it an extra inch of movement. In a similar vein, Orks desiring stealth will paint themselves purple; the logic being that 'no one has ever seen a purple Ork'. All this combined suggests that the only thing supplementing the Ork war machine is their own confidence in their methods- were there to be logic applied to the situation, the Orks would not be half as effective as they are. The Orks are very simple in their naming conventions; a weapon is basically named for what it is or does, usually without any meaningful name. The spelling of the names follows the Orks' convention of broken English words. A few examples; * Slugga ‚Äî Ork equivalent of a pistol * Shoota ‚Äî Ork assault rifle * Big Shoota ‚Äî Ork heavy machine gun * Speshul Shoota ‚Äî Ork shotgun * Supa' Charged Shoota ‚Äî A Shoota that is wired with an odd modification that allows it to easily pierce Space Marine Power Armour * Burna ‚Äî Ork flamethrower/ industrial cutting tool * Skorcha ‚Äî Heavier version of Burna, often vehicle-mounted * Deffgun ‚Äî Ork heavy automatic weapon, usually looted and heavily modified * Beamy Deffgun ‚Äî An Ork directed-energy weapon, typically shoulder-mounted and modified the same way as a Deffgun * Kustom Mega Blasta ‚Äî Incredibly strong energy weapon, used mainly by Meks * Rokkit Launcha ‚Äî Ork rocket launcher * Kombi Weapon ‚Äî Shoota with the addition of a single shot Skorcha or Rokkit Launcha * Snazzgun ‚Äî Personal weapon of firepower obsessed \\"Flash Gitz\\", extensively customised and potentially dangerous to the wielder * Dakkagun ‚Äî Heavy automatic weapon, equatable to a .50 cal machine gun. Often mounted in pairs or double-barrelled configurations on motorcycles * Dakkakannon ‚Äî Exceptionally large and powerful dakkagun capable of damaging enemy armour, wielded by very rare ork biker bosses * Boomgun ‚Äî Ork tank cannon (Found on Looted Wagons/Leman Russ tanks) * Zzap gun ‚Äî Ork tank cannon/ grot controlled cannon; electricity-based weapon * Killkannon ‚Äî Ork tank cannon (Mounted on Battlewagons) * Lobba ‚Äî Large mortar, rocket launcher, or even trebuchet/catapult * Shokk Attack Gun ‚Äî A massive and unorthodox weapon that teleports crazed and traumatised members of the snotlings subspecies into enemy ranks or vehicles * Uge' Choppa ‚Äî A two handed equivalent of the normal choppa, stronger and as an ork would say \\"more killy\\". Usually used by Nobs  Ork Warbosses  * The Beast - Boss of possibly the largest WAAAGH! to have ever existed which came dangerously close to destroying the Imperium around 32nd millennium. The Beast was also the largest Ork to have ever existed (although the Eldar stated that during the zenith of their civilisation they fought warbosses much larger and more powerful that would have easily have wiped out the Imperium, though this could be Eldar arrogance) , being at least ten meters tall. The real name of The Beast is unknown. * Wazzdakka Gutsmek - A Biker Boss who is the most killy speed freak ever known. Legend has it that he once destroyed a titan of the Legio Titanicus by driving through its void shields on his bike and smashing through the cockpit canopy. While still on fire from passing through the void shields, he set about slaughtering the princeps and his crew, and keeps the still burning skulls of the crew as his favored trophies. * Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka - (Probably) The most notorious Warboss alive. Responsible for the second and third Wars of Armageddon. He started as an insignificant goff boy, and after losing a fraction of his skull, went to see mad dok Grotsnik. The Painboy replaced the missing part of Ghazghkull's head with what is suggested to be part of a computer, covering it with adamantium plating; after this, he claimed to see visions of the Ork gods, Gork and Mork. Ghazgkull united the tribes, claiming to be the prophet of the WAAAAAGH!, and prepared to assault Armageddon. Ghazghkull is a complete monster in close combat, managing to rip armies apart with his powerclaw and armoured bulk. He is all but impossible to stop, and many planets have fallen to his mighty hordes. * Boss Zagstruk - A stormboy Boss who leads the infamous 'vulcha skwad' to battle. He and his elite squad of stormboyz are the shock troops of many an ork army. * Mad Dok Grotsnik - An ork 'dokter' who supposedly saved Ghazghkull's life when he was a goff boy. Ghazghkull's rise to fame gave the dokter the chance to experiment on Ghazghkull's orks. Grotsnik survived attempted murder by disgruntled patients, and had to be pieced back together by his gretchin orderlies. * Kaptin Badrukk - Badrukk is the leader of the Freebooterz; infamous Ork pirates and mercenaries. He is well known for helping Warlord Garaghak when fighting against the tyranids. He and his infamous mob of flash gits can light up battlefields with their highly powered Snazz guns. His preferred weapon is \\"Da Rippa\\", an Ogryn Ripper Gun modified to fire fuel rods. The radiation given off by the gun while firing is such that Badrukk must wear a lead lined coat for protection. * Gorgutz 'Ead 'Unter - An ork that plays a major role in all of the expansions of the original Dawn of War, reappearing as the leader of the Orks in Dawn of War 3. He excels at escaping from the enemy when all seems lost, making him intelligent in a way, and his combat ability is enough to take out an entire company of Imperial Guardsmen with no aid. His appearance and Wargear are similar to Ghazghkull Thraka in appearance. His campaigns are staged on Lorn V, Kronus, and the Kaurava system. He is still at large, waiting for the next moment to strike or simply building his WAAAAAGH! yet again. * Kaptin Bluddflagg - A Freeboota Warboss, known for his penchant (or obsession as it is) for hats, that appeared in the Dawn of War II game as the leader of the Ork Faction. *Old Zogwort - A renowned weirdboy who is said to have strangled 2 vipers at birth. Since then he goes into battle with a nest of vipers. He left his clan due to his curse of turning any unsuspecting independent character into a squig, and is currently a freebooter roaming the galaxy. *Grimskull not confirmed, however depicted in Space Marine (video game) - A Warboss leading a 'WAAAGH' onto Forge-world Graia. He would combat the Ultramarines, and others before being killed by Captain Titus. He is not confirmed to exist in the main timeline, however as said earlier, Grimskull was depicted in Space Marine.

It refers to all types of the theory that attempt to account for the probabilistic features of quantum mechanics by the mechanism of underlying inaccessible variables, with the additional requirement from local realism that distant events be independent, ruling out instantaneous (i.e. faster-than-light) interactions between separate events. The mathematical implications of a local hidden-variable theory in regard to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement were explored by physicist John S. Bell. Bell's 1964 paper (see Bell's theorem) showed that local hidden variables of certain types cannot reproduce the quantum measurement correlations that quantum mechanics predicts. The theory of quantum entanglement predicts that separated particles can briefly share common properties and respond to certain types of measurement as if they were a single particle. In particular, a measurement on one particle in one place can alter the probability distribution for the outcomes of a measurement on the other particle at a different location. If a measurement setting in one location instantaneously modifies the probability distribution that applies at a distant location, then local hidden variables are ruled out. For an expanded description, see Bell's theorem. Local hidden variables and the Bell tests Bell's theorem starts with the implication of the principle of local realism, that separated measurement processes are independent. Based on this premise, the probability of a coincidence between separated measurements of particles with correlated (e.g. identical or opposite) orientation properties can be written: where p_A(a, \\\\lambda) is the probability of detection of particle A with hidden variable \\\\lambda by detector A, set in direction a, and similarly p_B(b, \\\\lambda) is the probability at detector B, set in direction b, for particle B, sharing the same value of \\\\lambda. The source is assumed to produce particles in the state \\\\lambda with probability \\\\rho(\\\\lambda). Using (), various Bell inequalities can be derived, these inequalities provide limits on the possible behaviour of local hidden-variable models. When John Bell originally derived his inequality, it was in relation to pairs of entangled spin-1/2 particles, every one of those emitted being detected. Bell showed that when detectors are rotated with respect to each other, local realist models must yield a correlation curve that is bounded by a straight line between maxima (detectors aligned), whereas the quantum correlation curve is a cosine relationship. The first Bell test experiments were performed not with spin-1/2 particles, but with photons, which have spin 1. A classical local hidden-variable prediction for photons, based on Maxwell's equations, yields a cosine curve, but of reduced amplitude, such that the curve still lies within the straight-line limits specified in the original Bell inequality. A great variety of realist models could be proposed, and they can be arbitrary provided that they yield results consistent with experiments. Bell's theorem assumes that measurement settings are completely independent, and not in principle determined by the universe at large. If this assumption were to be incorrect, as proposed in superdeterminism, conclusions drawn from Bell's theorem may be invalidated. The theorem also relies on very efficient and space-like separated measurements, not yet satisfied simultaneously experimentally. Such flaws are generally called loopholes. Bell tests with no \\"non-detections\\" Consider, for example, David Bohm's thought experiment (Bohm, 1951), in which a molecule breaks into two atoms with opposite spins. Assume that this spin can be represented by a real vector, pointing in any direction. It will be the \\"hidden variable\\" in our model. Taking it to be a unit vector, all possible values of the hidden variable are represented by all points on the surface of a unit sphere. Suppose that the spin is to be measured in the direction a. Then the natural assumption, given that all atoms are detected, is that all atoms the projection of whose spin in the direction a is positive will be detected as spin-up (coded as +1), while all whose projection is negative will be detected as spin-down (coded as ‚àí1). The surface of the sphere will be divided into two regions, one for +1, one for ‚àí1, separated by a great circle in the plane perpendicular to a. Assuming for convenience that a is horizontal, corresponding to the angle a with respect to some suitable reference direction, the dividing circle will be in a vertical plane. So far we have modelled side A of our experiment. Now to model side B. Assume that b too is horizontal, corresponding to the angle b. There will be second great circle drawn on the same sphere, to one side of which we have +1, the other ‚àí1 for particle B. The circle will be again in a vertical plane. The two circles divide the surface of the sphere into four regions. The type of \\"coincidence\\" (++, ‚àí‚àí, +‚àí or ‚àí+) observed for any given pair of particles is determined by the region within which their hidden variable falls. Assuming the source to be \\"rotationally invariant\\" (to produce all possible states Œª with equal probability), the probability of a given type of coincidence will clearly be proportional to the corresponding area, and these areas will vary linearly with the angle between a and b. (To see this, think of an orange and its segments. The area of peel corresponding to a number n of segments is roughly proportional to n. More accurately, it is proportional to the angle subtended at the centre.) The formula () above has not been used explicitly ‚Äì it is hardly relevant when, as here, the situation is fully deterministic. The problem could be reformulated in terms of the functions in the formula, with œÅ constant and the probability functions step functions. The principle behind () has in fact been used, but purely intuitively. The realist prediction (solid lines) for quantum correlation when there are no non-detections. The quantum- mechanical prediction is the dotted curve. Thus the local hidden-variable prediction for the probability of coincidence is proportional to the angle (b ‚àí a) between the detector settings. The quantum correlation is defined to be the expectation value of the sum of the individual outcomes, and this is where P++ is the probability of a \\"+\\" outcome on both sides, P+‚àí that of a \\"+\\" on side A, a \\"‚àí\\" on side B, etc. Since each individual term varies linearly with the difference (b ‚àí a), so does their sum. The result is shown in the figure. Optical Bell tests In almost all real applications of Bell's inequalities, the particles used have been photons. It is not necessarily assumed that the photons are particle-like. They may be just short pulses of classical light (Clauser, 1978). It is not assumed that every single one is detected. Instead the hidden variable set at the source is taken to determine only the probability of a given outcome, the actual individual outcomes being partly determined by other hidden variables local to the analyser and detector. It is assumed that these other hidden variables are independent on the two sides of the experiment (Clauser, 1974; Bell, 1971). In this stochastic model, in contrast to the above deterministic case, we do need equation () to find the local-realist prediction for coincidences. It is necessary first to make some assumption regarding the functions p_A(a, \\\\lambda) and p_B(a, \\\\lambda), the usual one being that these are both cosine squares, in line with Malus' law. Assuming the hidden variable to be polarisation direction (parallel on the two sides in real applications, not orthogonal), equation () becomes where \\\\phi = b - a. The predicted quantum correlation can be derived from this and is shown in the figure. The realist prediction (solid curve) for quantum correlation in an optical Bell test. The quantum-mechanical prediction is the dotted curve. In optical tests, incidentally, it is not certain that the quantum correlation is well-defined. Under a classical model of light, a single photon can go partly into the \\"+\\" channel, partly into the \\"‚àí\\" one, resulting in the possibility of simultaneous detections in both. Though experiments such as by Grangier et al. (Grangier, 1986) have shown that this probability is very low, it is not logical to assume that it is actually zero. The definition of quantum correlation is adapted to the idea that outcomes will always be +1, ‚àí1 or 0. There is no obvious way of including any other possibility, which is one of the reasons why Clauser and Horne's 1974 Bell test, using single-channel polarisers, should be used instead of the CHSH Bell test. The CH74 inequality concerns just probabilities of detection, not quantum correlations.  Quantum states with a local hidden-variable model  For separable states of two particles, there is a simple hidden-variable model for any measurements on the two parties. Surprisingly, there are also entangled states for which all von Neumann measurements can be described by a hidden-variable model. Such states are entangled, but do not violate any Bell inequality. The so-called Werner states are a single-parameter family of states that are invariant under any transformation of the type U \\\\otimes U, where U is a unitary matrix. For two qubits, they are noisy singlets given as {4},}} where the singlet is defined as \\\\vert \\\\psi^-\\\\rangle = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(\\\\vert 01\\\\rangle - \\\\vert 10\\\\rangle\\\\right). R. F. Werner showed that such states allow for a hidden- variable model for p \\\\leq 1/2, while they are entangled if p > 1/3. The bound for hidden-variable models could be improved until p = 2/3. Hidden-variable models have been constructed for Werner states even if POVM measurements are allowed, not only von Neumann measurements. Hidden variable models were also constructed to noisy maximally entangled states, and even extended to arbitrary pure states mixed with white noise. Beside bipartite systems, there are also results for the multipartite case. A hidden-variable model for any von Neumann measurements at the parties has been presented for a three-qubit quantum state. Generalizations of the models By varying the assumed probability and density functions in equation (), we can arrive at a considerable variety of local-realist predictions. =Time effects= Previously some new hypotheses were conjectured concerning the role of time in constructing hidden-variables theory. One approach is suggested by K. Hess and W. Philipp (Hess, 2002) and discusses possible consequences of time dependences of hidden variables, previously not taken into account by Bell's theorem. This hypothesis has been criticized by R. D. Gill, G. Weihs, A. Zeilinger and M. ≈ªukowski (Gill, 2002). Another hypothesis suggests to review the notion of physical time (Kurakin, 2004). Hidden variables in this concept evolve in so called \\"hidden time\\", not equivalent to physical time. Physical time relates to \\"hidden time\\" by some \\"sewing procedure\\". This model stays physically non-local, though the locality is achieved in mathematical sense. = Implications for general relativity and quantum gravity = General relativity and various quantum gravity theories predict that the intrinsic quantum spin should bend the spacetime around it, breaking its spherical symmetry. However, through a spin-spacetime EPR gedanken experiment (see figure below), it follows that such a spin-related deviation from spherical symmetry would violate relativistic causality. To avoid a paradox, the measurable spacetime (which is associated with quantum spin) has to be spherically symmetric. Thus, this spacetime version of the EPR experiment sheds important insights on the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. A time dilation (spacetime) version of the EPR experiment The spacelike EPR experiment gedanken experiment is performed with the following stages: \\\\bf (a) An EPR pair of spin-¬Ω particles, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left( \\\\left\\\\uparrow \\\\downarrow \\\\right\\\\rangle - \\\\left\\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow \\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) is prepared and distributed to Alice and Bob. \\\\bf (b) Alice measures her particle with a Stern‚ÄìGerlach setup. By orienting her magnets, Alice controls the orientation of both spins. She can set them to be parallel to any direction she desires (e.g., parallel to the X-axis or parallel to the Y-axis). \\\\bf (c) Bob measures the time dilation effect around his spin-¬Ω particle. To do that he uses extremely precise clocks placed symmetrically around his particle. If spin is an anisotropic source of gravity, then Bob can figure out which Stern-Gerlach orientation Alice chose. This creates a paradox - as it violates relativistic causality. In conclusion it is asserted that the measurable spacetime around spin-¬Ω particles must be spherically symmetric. =Optical models deviating from Malus' law= If we make realistic (wave-based) assumptions regarding the behaviour of light on encountering polarisers and photodetectors, we find that we are not compelled to accept that the probability of detection will reflect Malus' law exactly. We might perhaps suppose the polarisers to be perfect, with output intensity of polariser A proportional to cos2(a ‚àí Œª), but reject the quantum-mechanical assumption that the function relating this intensity to the probability of detection is a straight line through the origin. Real detectors, after all, have \\"dark counts\\" that are there even when the input intensity is zero, and become saturated when the intensity is very high. It is not possible for them to produce outputs in exact proportion to input intensity for all intensities. By varying our assumptions, it seems possible that the realist prediction could approach the quantum-mechanical one within the limits of experimental error (Marshall, 1983), though clearly a compromise must be reached. We have to match both the behaviour of the individual light beam on passage through a polariser and the observed coincidence curves. The former would be expected to follow Malus' law fairly closely, though experimental evidence here is not so easy to obtain. We are interested in the behaviour of very weak light and the law may be slightly different from that of stronger light. General remarks Hydrodynamic quantum analogs provide some experimental support for local hidden-variable models. Walking-droplet systems have been found to mimic several quantum-mechanical phenomena, including particle diffraction, quantum tunneling, quantized orbits, the Zeeman effect, and the quantum corral. Keith Moffatt states: \\"The work of Yves Couder and the related work of John Bush ‚Ä¶ provides the possibility of understanding previously incomprehensible quantum phenomena, involving 'wave-particle duality', in purely classical terms\\".

Several figures have their left hand replaced by a weapon of some kind. Battle Beasts were created, largely produced by Takara and distributed by Takara in Japan (under the name BeastFormers) and by Hasbro outside Japan, beginning in 1987. History Battle Beasts were created by Takara of Japan in 1986. Tomy Co., Ltd., aka K.K. Takara-Tomy, still owns the worldwide rights to the property. The heyday for the toyline came during the period in which it was licensed to Hasbro for distribution outside Japan when Hasbro marketed the toys in America and many other parts of the world. Although in the Japanese market Takara branded the toys as a spin-off of Transformers and even named the toys \\"BeastFormers,\\" their tie-in to the Transformers universe was not part of the Hasbro story or marketing. As part of the Takara strategy, many of the Battle Beasts appeared in the episode \\"Rebellion on Planet Beast\\" of the Japanese Transformers cartoon series Transformers: The Headmasters. The Battle Beasts reside on the planet Beast. Four series were released overall. The first three contain beasts 1 - 76. Each figure has a heat sensitive rub sign on his/her chest and a hand-to-hand weapon. Three pull-back vehicles and three transforming bases were also released. The fourth series had 36 figures and was renamed Laser Beasts, the renaming corresponded with some minor changes to the figures. The entire Laser Beast line was released in Japan, and in small numbers in America and Europe. These figures have orbs in their chest instead of rubs and each came with a gun that resembled the creature who held it. Some small chariots were also released as part of the Laser Beast line in Japan. In addition to these figures, some promo figures were also made. These were made of clear plastic and were available only in special sets. The figures were released in Japan in small boxes of individual figures and in larger multi- packs. In America Series 1, 2 and the 12 Laser Beasts were released on blister cards with two figures per card. Series 3 figures were only available in boxes of eight per package. The vehicles came in boxes and each came with a figure. Story The universe history of 2011 takes place in the galaxy territory of the Decepticon‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlanet Beast.‚Äù The intelligent race of animals called BeastFormers lived in peace on Planet Beast. However, the scheming evil hand of the Decepticon's bent on domination of the entire universe to the peaceful Planet Beast was fast approaching. To defeat the Lion Family that ruled Planet Beast, Galvatron supplied Alligatron with weapons in order to overthrow the Lion family. Alligatron was given the Sharkticons, who were the military escorts of the Destrons to fight in the rebellion. This is how the BeastFormer war began. The Beast Star was suddenly engulfed in war. Before Alligatron the wielder of the Decepticon Power and his Decepticon Beast's could capture the Cybertron Beasts, they were able to escape into the forest. In order to ask for help from the Transformers Cybertron Army, the Cybertron Beast's strongest warrior Platinum Tiger had to make his way to the occupied communication room of the palace. However, Alligatron planted a trap there called the \\"Holography Mirror.\\" As soon as Platinum Tiger unwittingly set foot in the palace, a sudden flash of light trapped the strongest warrior in the holography mirror. Is Planet Beast going to remain under occupation? What about the fate of the Supreme Commander White Leo's Cybertron Beasts? Can Platinum Tiger escape from the power of the Holography Mirror? Right now, the battle and mystery of the BeastFormers is just beginning. =Series 1 - 3: Battle Beasts= Japanese Battle Beast catalog. Battle Beasts came out in the late 1980s and like most toys of the era, had a gimmick to help sales. Each Battle Beast had a heat sensitive sticker on his chest which, when rubbed would reveal the warrior's strength. The symbols would represent either fire, wood or water and could be used in a rock, paper, scissors type game--fire beat wood, wood beat water, water beat fire. Later a fourth emblem was added, the Sunburst, and it would beat all other types. The Sunburst was extremely rare, in a ten pack in Japan, or Pirate Leo was available in America as a variant, despite claims that there were others of that affiliation. Each Beast also carried his own distinctive weapon which could be identified to its Beast with the corresponding number. In the U.S. Battle Beasts came in packages of two, usually (but not always) in numerical order. It was impossible to tell which figure had a rub of fire, wood, or water until the package was opened. That came in handy with marketing, as their slogan was, Fire! Wood! Or Water!... You'll never know until you own them!. Also listed on the packages starting with Series 2 was the possibility of getting the Sunburst Warrior. There was a total of three series adding up to 76 Battle Beasts beginning with #1, Pirate Lion and ending with #76, Crooked Crow. Series 1 & 2 were released in Japan, Europe and North America while Series 3 was only released in Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. =Series 4: Shadow Warriors= Japanese Laser Beast catalog cover. The fourth and final series released was named Shadow Warriors, or Laser Beasts in Japan. The heat sensitive sticker was replaced by an orb that could be seen through, depicting which clan the Beast represented. The Shadow Warriors had a new slogan on the American package that read Fire! Wood! Water!... Only the crystal shield will reveal their strength!. Shadow Warriors carried guns instead of the hand-to-hand weapons that the Battle Beasts had, and each gun resembled the creature to which it belonged. The entire new series of 36 Laser Beasts and new sleds were released mainly in Japan. North America only received 12 of the new Laser Beasts, which were packaged as ‚ÄúShadow Warriors‚Äù in two-pack blister cards. These were mainly sold by Value City stores. No accessories, such as sleds or shields, were released, although they appeared on the packaging. Some of the lower numbered Lasers were produced in Europe and a few came with unique shields and sleds that like the guns, resembled the animal it belonged to. The sleds from Japan were available in two colors (grey and bordeaux) and both were included in the Six Shield Battler set. In France a third color, purple, appeared. This exclusive color was included in the blister packs of Laser Beasts #93 to #96, the grey one was available with Beasts #89 to #92, and the bordeaux was available with Beasts #97 to #100. The main color of the sled is not the only difference. The color of the wheels change too. The grey sled has orange wheels, the bordeaux sled has black wheels and the purple sled has yellow wheels. Six of the 12 shields were released only in Europe; #89 Brown Lion, #92 Hustlebear, #95 Dragon Seahorn, #97 Seapanic, #98 Puzzlecolor and #100 Scope Cougar.

Vehicles A number of vehicles were released throughout the line. For the Battle Beast line, three chariots and three bases were released that looked like animals, and each came with one figure that was not unique to the vehicle. The chariots were able to hold up to three figures comfortably and each had its own name: Tearin' Tiger, which looked like a tiger, Big Horn which looked like a ram and Deer Stalker which looked like a deer. All the chariots had a pull-back motion that would spring the vehicle forward when it was released. The three bases were the Blazing Eagle (known as the Firebird in a toy commercial for the vehicles), Shocking Shark and Wood Beetle. Each base had a unique symbol theme that matched the \\"Fire, Wood, Water\\" concept that the line was based on. Each base could hold several figures and had a jail-cell with which to hold captured Beasts. The Laser Beast line had several vehicles as well. Three Battle chariots which were smaller than the Battle Beast chariots could be purchased with a unique figure, and several types of Drills were released as well. To date, there are four known types of Drills to exist, all of which are the same design but feature different colors; Gold, Maroon, Yellow and Blue. The Blue Drill is the rarest, with only three or four known to exist. Premium figures There were several promotional figures released in Japan throughout the run that could be obtained in certain ways, mainly through mail-aways or by purchasing special sets. Most of the figures weren't exactly new, as most of the premium figures were just repaints of previously existing molds. Figures that were repaints were the Stone Cobra, Clear Gator, Clear Carp and the Striped Carp. The only exception to this rule was the mail-away offer for the #101 Skull Grotess figure, which was a completely original figure. Premium figures were available in various ways. The Clear Gator and Sunburst Lion could be obtained by purchasing a Japanese 10-pack set that contained either one figure or the other although the owner couldn't tell until he or she opened the package. The Stone Cobra could only be obtained through the mailing of the two halves of the \\"Stone Tablet\\". One half could be found in the Japanese Fire Phoenix playset (which was the Japanese equivalent to the American Blazing Eagle set), while the other was in the Sunburst Lion set. The Stone Cobra was sent out in two different waves due to a larger demand than Takara originally expected. The first way came with no rub, the second came with a sticker that had White Leo's face on it. The Clear and Striped Carps could be found in the Japanese \\"Punch Box\\" set, which was basically a box that had covers which the owner would \\"punch\\" to find a figure. The Striped Carp was much more rare than the Clear version. The Skull Grotess figure could be purchased (along with a Gold Drill) through a mail-away offer exclusively. An order form advertising the figure could be found in almost all single-figure packages sold in Japan. Merchandise Blackthorne's Battle Beasts #1. Starting with the second series of figures in America, a 23\\" x 30\\" poster was available via mail order featuring drawings of all the Battle Beasts as well as their names. A strap called the Bandolier was introduced for children to hold and carry around their Battle Beasts figures, in the middle of it was a box that has the Battle Beasts logo on it and all over it are compartments to hold several figures. A comic series simply titled Battle Beasts was published by Blackthorne Publishing from February through November 1988. There were only four issues published by the company before it was canceled on a cliffhanger. All four issues were published in black-and-white. The stories were written by John Stephenson, penciled by Andy Ice, and inked by Jorge Pacheco (issues 1 and 2), Shepherd Hendrix (issue 3), and Rachel \\"Fuzzy\\" Haze (issue 4). They centered primarily on seven characters: Horny Toad, Knight Owl, and Gargantuan Gorilla dealing with the betrayal of Chameleon, Rocky Rhino, Blitzkrieg Bat, and Cutthroat Cuttlefish, who interrupted a ceremony with the Soulspirit causing madness and constant sign changes among their people. A sludgy devil character called Ruhin was also featured. The final issue implied that Pirate Lion, piloting the Shocking Shark with first mate Webslinger Spider, was the Sunburst Warrior who would be able to set things aright. Two annuals were published as well, although by a different company and they were only released in Europe. The stories are unrelated to the Blackthorne series. Revivals In 2011 Takara Tomy announced the Beast Saga line, a spiritual successor to the original figures. The line focuses on three factions - land, air and sea. The fire/wood/water battling mechanism was replaced by a dice launcher which enables a dice battle game between figures. The series was released in September 2012. Figures include shields in addition to weapons and have been released in monthly waves. Shonen Jump produced a manga based on the toy line and an anime was released in 2013. At the 2009 San Diego Comic Con, Diamond Select Toys, announced that it had acquired the Battle Beasts brand name after Hasbro allowed the trademark to lapse. They displayed a playset featuring a Minimates version of their new Battle Beasts line. The playset was to become available for sale on December 31, 2009, but was cancelled. Several repaints of the figure were sold in 2010, and at C2E2 2012 the company confirmed they would be going forward with a full line of figures. Additionally, a comic book based on the Minimates franchise was released by IDW Publishing in May 2012. Also in 2012, a small company called Plastic Imagination! announced Rise of the Beasts, a forthcoming line of minifigures with articulated arms and necks inspired by the original 1980s toys. The project launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, but the Kickstarter was cancelled pre-funding due to factory issues. In August 2014, factory test shots were posted as an update to the Kickstarter project and an estimated release date of full production figures was given as November or December 2014. The first figures to be released are the Rhino and Scorpion characters that were teased during the original campaign. Changes to the original design include articulation at the neck, shoulders and waist, instead of just at the shoulders. Also the joints use Glyos pegs.

Corbett OBE (28 February 1925 ‚Äì 21 March 1982) was an English actor and comedian, who co-starred alongside Wilfrid Brambell in the long-running BBC television sitcom Steptoe and Son, which was broadcast from 1962‚Äì65 and 1970‚Äì74. Early life Corbett, the youngest of seven children, was born in Rangoon, Burma, where his father, George Corbett (1885/86‚Äì1943), was serving as a company quartermaster sergeant in the South Staffordshire Regiment of the British Army, stationed at a cantonment as part of the Colonial defence forces. Corbett was sent to Britain after his mother, Caroline Emily, n√©e Barnsley, (1884‚Äì1926) died of dysentery when he was eighteen months old. He was then brought up by his aunt, Annie Williams, in Earl Street, Ardwick, Manchester and later on a new council estate in Wythenshawe. He attended Ross Place and Benchill Primary Schools; although he passed the scholarship exam for entry to Chorlton Grammar School, he was not able to take up his place there and instead attended Sharston Secondary School.Corbett, S. (2012). Harry H. Corbett ‚Äì The Front Legs of the Cow. The History Press, Stroud, Glos. Corbett enlisted in the Royal Marines during the Second World War, and served in the Home Fleet on the heavy cruiser HMS Devonshire. After VJ Day in 1945, he was posted to the Far East, where he was involved in quelling unrest in New Guinea and reportedly killed two Japanese soldiers there whilst engaged in hand-to-hand fighting. He was then posted to Tonga, but deserted and remained in Australia before handing himself in to the Military Police. His military service left him with a damaged bladder following an infection, and a red mark on his eye caused by a thorn, which was not treated until late in his life. Upon returning to civilian life, Corbett trained as a radiographer before taking up acting as a career, initially in repertory. In the early 1950s, he added the initial \\"H\\" to avoid confusion with the television entertainer Harry Corbett, known for his act with the glove-puppet Sooty. He joked that \\"H\\" stood for \\"hennyfink\\", a Cockney pronunciation of \\"anything\\". In 1956, he appeared on stage in The Family Reunion at the Phoenix Theatre in London. From 1958, Corbett began to appear regularly in films, coming to public attention as a serious, intense performer, in contrast to his later reputation in sitcom. He appeared in television dramas such as The Adventures of Robin Hood (as four characters in episodes between 1957 and 1960) and Police Surgeon (1960). He also worked and studied Stanislavski's system at Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London. Career =Steptoe and Son= In 1962, scriptwriters Galton and Simpson, who had been successful with Hancock's Half Hour, invited Corbett to appear in \\"The Offer\\", an episode of the BBC's anthology series of one-off comedy plays, Comedy Playhouse, written by Galton and Simpson. He played Harold Steptoe, a rag-and- bone man who lives with his irascible widower father, Albert (Wilfrid Brambell) in a dilapidated house attached to their junkyard and stable for their cart horse, Hercules. At the time, Corbett was working at the Bristol Old Vic, where he appeared as Macbeth. The programme was a success and a full series followed, continuing, with breaks, until 1974, when the Christmas special became the final episode. Although the popularity of Steptoe and Son made Corbett a star, it damaged his serious acting career, as he became irreversibly associated with Steptoe in the public eye. As a result, severe typecasting forced him to come back to the role of Harold Steptoe over and over. Before the series began, Corbett had played Shakespeare's Richard II to great acclaim; however, when he played Hamlet in 1970, he felt both critics and audiences alike were not taking him seriously and could only see him as Steptoe. Corbett found himself receiving offers only for bawdy comedies or loose parodies of Steptoe. Production of the sitcom was stressful in the last few years, as Brambell was an alcoholic, often ill-prepared for rehearsals and forgetting his lines and movements. A tour of a Steptoe and Son stage production in Australia in 1977 proved a disaster due to Brambell's drinking. During the tour, the pair appeared in character in an advert for Ajax soap powder. The television episodes were remade for radio, often with the original cast; it is these that were made available on cassette and CD. After the series of Steptoe and Son had officially finished, Corbett and Brambell played the characters again on radio (in a newly written sketch to tie in with the Scottish Team's participation in the 1978 World Cup), as well as in a television commercial for Kenco coffee. The two men reunited in January 1981 for one final performance as Steptoe and Son in a further commercial for Kenco.'' The Curse of Steptoe, a BBC television play about Corbett and Brambell, was broadcast on 19 March 2008 on the British television channel BBC Four, featuring Jason Isaacs as Corbett. The first broadcast gained the channel its highest audience figures to that date, based on overnight returns.Chris Tryhorn \\"BBC4 breaks ratings record\\", The Guardian, 19 March 2008 =Other work= Steptoe and Son led Corbett to comedy films: as James Ryder in Ladies Who Do (1963); with Ronnie Barker in The Bargee (1964), written by Galton and Simpson; Carry On Screaming! (1966); the \\"Lust\\" segment of The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins (1971); and Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky (1977). There were two Steptoe and Son films: Steptoe and Son (1972) and Steptoe and Son Ride Again (1973). In 1966 he appeared as a narrator in four episodes of the BBC children's television series Jackanory, and he also had the leading role in two other television series, Mr. Aitch (written especially for him, 1967) and Grundy (1980). Corbett had a supporting role in the David Essex film Silver Dream Racer (1980), and also appeared in the film Hardcore (1977). In addition, he had a supporting role in Potter (1980) with Arthur Lowe on the BBC. Corbett recorded multiple 45rpm records, most of which were novelty songs based upon the rag-and-bone character, including \\"Harry, You Love Her\\" and \\"Junk Shop\\". He recorded a number of sea shanties and folk songs. In 1973, he recorded an album titled Only Authorised Employees To Break Bottles which was a \\"showcase of accents\\", with songs from Corbett in a range of accents, including Liverpudlian, Brummie and Mancunian; the title echoes a notice which is visible in the bottle-smashing scene in the film 'The Bargee'. The album was recorded in 1973 andhttp://peterice.com/RA.htm released in 1974 on the Torquay, Devon based RA record label with support from seventies folk band 'Faraway Folk': RALP 6022 http://peterice.com/RA.htm Including the album, he released over 30 songs. Personal life Corbett married twice, first to the actress Sheila Steafel (from 1958 to 1964), and then to actress Maureen Blott (stage name Crombie) (from 1969 to 1982), with whom he had two children, Jonathan and Susannah. Susannah is an actress and author, and has written a biography of her father, Harry H. Corbett: The Front Legs of the Cow, which was published in March 2012. Steafel published her autobiography When Harry Met Sheila in 2010. =Politics= Corbett was a Labour Party campaigner,Misc  Homepage ‚Äì This Is Local London appeared in a party political broadcast, and was a guest of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The television character Harold Steptoe appears as the Labour Party secretary for Shepherd's Bush West in the sixth series episode, \\"Tea for Two\\". In 1969, Corbett appeared as Harold Steptoe in a Labour Party political broadcast, where Bob Mellish had to argue against Steptoe‚Äôs accusation that all parties are the same. This was not in any way connected to Galton and Simpson, who wrote Steptoe and Son. As Prime Minister, Wilson wished to have Corbett appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), but the middle initial \\"H\\" was lost in the process and the award went to the Sooty puppeteer, Harry Corbett, instead.Sin to Win: Seven Deadly Steps to Success, Marc Lewis Both were eventually included in the same New Year's Honours list on 1 January 1976.Supplement to the London Gazette, 1 January 1976 =Health issues and death= A heavy smoker all his adult life, Corbett had his first heart attack in September 1979. According to his daughter, he smoked 60 cigarettes a day until the heart attack, after which he cut down to 20. He appeared in pantomime at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley, within two days of leaving hospital. He was then badly hurt in a car accident. He appeared shortly afterwards in the BBC detective series Shoestring, his facial injuries obvious. Other work included the film Silver Dream Racer, with David Essex, and a Thames Television/ITV comedy series Grundy, both in 1980. In the latter, Corbett played an old man discovering the permissive society after a lifetime of clean living.The Times, 14 July 1980 The series was a flop and was soon cancelled. Corbett's final role was an episode of the Anglia Television/ITV series Tales of the Unexpected, entitled \\"The Moles\\". It featured a man who planned to tunnel into a bank, only to find the bank was closed due to industrial action and there was no money in the vaults. Filmed shortly before his death, it was broadcast two months later, in May 1982. Corbett died of a heart attack on 21 March 1982 in Hastings, East Sussex. He was 57 years old. He is buried in the graveyard at St Michael the Archangel church at Penhurst, East Sussex. The headstone inscription, chosen by his wife Maureen, reads \\"The earth can have but earth, which is his due: My spirit is thine, the better part of me\\", from William Shakespeare's Sonnet 74. Maureen was buried alongside him in 1999. Corbett is commemorated in the name of the Corbett Theatre at the East 15 Acting School at Loughton. Selected filmography References External links  Harry H.

History Dolphin jumping The property on which Theater of the Sea sits was formerly a quarry used to supply rock for construction of Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad. When the railroad went bankrupt after the devastating Labor Day Hurricane, the property was sold by the receivership to a local for $800 (having no interest in the property, the local was offered a parcel stretching to Whale Harbor, about 0.2 miles to the west, for the same $800).

Biography =Early life= Bend was born in Poplar Point, Manitoba, the son of J.P. Bend (who unsuccessfully ran for the Manitoba legislature in 1927 and 1932 as a Conservative) and Annie Ada Wilson. The younger Bend received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba, taught school and later worked as a school principal. He later received a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Manitoba. In 1938, Bend married Laura Kathleen Fisher. =Politics= In 1949, Bend was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the riding of Rockwood. The election was somewhat unusual, in that Bend ran as an \\"Independent Progressive Conservative\\" supporting the Liberal-Progressive-Progressive Conservative governing coalition, while his opponent R.A. Quickfall was an Independent Liberal opposing the government. Bend won with over two-thirds of the vote. The Progressive Conservatives left the governing coalition in 1950, but Bend continued to support the government of Liberal-Progressive Premier Douglas Campbell. He scored an easy re-election in 1953, this time running as an \\"Independent Liberal-Progressive\\". On January 25, 1955, he was named Minister of Health and Public Welfare in the Campbell government. =Defeat and retirement= The Progressive Conservatives under Dufferin Roblin won a minority government in 1958, though Bend was again re-elected in the renamed riding of Rockwood-Ibreville. The following year, however, he was defeated by Tory candidate George Hutton. Bend remained out of active political life for the next decade. In 1969, he stood for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party (as the Liberal-Progressives had renamed themselves), and scored an easily first-ballot win over his three opponents (none of whom had legislative experience). The selection of Bend proved to be a strategic error for the party. Bend represented the rural populist wing of the Liberal Party, and was unable to reach an urban audience. Under his influence, the party adopted a \\"cowboy\\"/\\"rodeo\\" theme for the campaign, which made it look and sound dated. The Liberals tumbled to only five seats, the fewest they had ever won. Bend himself was narrowly defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Harry Enns in the riding of Lakeside (which Campbell had previously held for 47 years). He stepped down as Liberal leader shortly thereafter, and did not seek provincial office again. Bend subsequently returned to the education field, serving as superintendent of a rural school division. He died at Rosewood Lodge in Stonewall at the age of 85. Bend spent 50 years as a baseball umpire and was inducted into the Manitoba Baseball Hale of Fame in 1997. There is currently an elementary school named after him in Stonewall, Manitoba, called \\"√âcole R.W. Bobby Bend School.\\"R.W.

History The building opened in a former workhouse building as the City of London Union Infirmary in 1874. The palatial design of the workhouse had been created by architect Richard Tress and had cost over ¬£55,000 to construct, boasted central heating, a dining-hall measuring 100 feet by 50 feet, Siberian marble pillars, and a chapel with stained glass windows and a new organ. It closed in 1909 but re-opened as a hospital for chronically ill people becoming known as the City of London Institution in 1912 and as the Bow Institution in 1913. It became a psychiatric unit, known by its most commonly adopted name of 'St Clement's Hospital' in 1936. The west side of the site suffered extensive bomb damage during the war, destroying the chapel and the sites initial symmetry. The hospital joined the newly formerd National Health Service in 1948 and then came under the same management as the London Hospital in 1968. After services were transferred to a new Adult Mental Health Facility at Mile End Hospital, the hospital closed in February 2006. = London's First Community Land Trust = Following the hospital's closure the site was transferred from the NHS to English Partnerships, then to the Homes and Communities Agency, and eventually the Greater London Authority, who marketed it as a regeneration opportunity in 2011. Following a long campaign, the Greater London Authority announced in April 2012 that the site would include London's first Community Land Trust. Mayor of London Boris Johnson broke the ground on the site in March 2014. The house prices are not be based on the open market rate but instead are linked to the average median salaries in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

The community was founded in 1898 by Tolstoyans and today has no spare land available with over sixty homes and 120 colonists. At the beginning, private property was rejected and personal property shared; however, today the colonists' homes are privately owned and sold at market value. As the colony abandoned Tolstoy's philosophy it has been regarded by many, including Mohandas Gandhi who visited in 1909, as a failed Tolstoyan experiment. History The colony was set up in 1898 by a Quaker journalist, Samuel Veale Bracher, along with other Tolstoyans. Bracher purchased along with seeds, tools, materials and provisions. The colonists then burnt the property deeds on the end of a pitchfork in a symbolic rejection of the notion of property. Aylmer Maude led the founding board of trustees for the colony. The early settlers had utopian socialist ideals, sharing provisions and going back-to-the-land. The founding colonists numbered about eight but over time the community rose to forty with anyone welcome. However Bracher, his family and other founders left the colony soon afterwards as they became increasingly frustrated with the other residents' idleness. Early life in the colony was spartan with some residents using a barn as shelter - piped water did not arrive until 1949 and electricity not until 1954. The site was originally open land surrounding Whiteway House but is now heavily wooded and home to a collection of mainly wooden buildings - as no one owns the land, mortgages could not be obtained so people had to build their own houses. A court ruling in 1955 established that nobody owns the legal title for the land. A communal hall was built by residents in 1924 to house social activities and a school, and a swimming pool was built in 1969. Whiteway Colony is still in existence today and houses, among others, descendants of its original settlers. Though it no longer has an explicitly anarchist character, today's residents are aware, and proud, of its origins. Traces of them run through the community still, the best examples being the continued use and maintenance of communal facilities (hall, swimming pool and playing field). In addition, the governance of the community is still done by a general meeting of its residents. Over the years residents have included immigrant anarchists, conscientious objectors and refugees from the Spanish Civil War, as well as co-operative ventures such as Protheroe's Bakery (known in the local area for the quality of its bread), the Cotswold Co- operative Handicraft guild and the Co-operative Gardening Group. For a period the anarchist newspaper Freedom was produced here by Thomas Keell.

Each SHA was responsible for managing performance, enacting directives and implementing health policy as required by the Department of Health at a regional level.  History  In 2002, the existing regional health authorities were renamed and merged to form 28 new strategic health authorities, under the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002. This was the first time that the regional tier in the NHS reported directly to the centre rather than having a board and non-executive members. The SHA chief executives were appointed after a wide-ranging search and selection process and did not represent continuity with the previous regions, not least because CEOs were allocated to areas they were not generally familiar with. A number of the new CEOs had previously been health authority CEOs or CEOs of large trusts, rather than being on the traditional path. The role of the SHAs was set out in Shifting the Balance of Power within the NHS ‚Äì Securing Delivery and included the following: The goal was to create a coherent strategic framework for the development of services across the full range of local NHS organisations, including: * Performance management * Brokering solutions where there were disputes * Building capacity and supporting performance improvement * Preparing and delivering cohesive strategies for capital investment * Working with workforce confederations (in some unspecified way) * Ensuring effective professional leadership across their area. = Evolution = A pivotal event seems to have been a loss of financial control in 2005/6 and a failure of the management system to respond quickly or firmly enough. This, combined with some ministerial ambivalence about the effectiveness of SHAs and a promise in the 2005 election to reduce NHS management spending, led to Patricia Hewitt, Secretary of State for Health to announce that, following an NHS consultation which ended in March 2006, the SHAs were to be reorganized. They were reduced to ten in number by the Strategic Health Authorities (Establishment and Abolition) (England) Order 2006, as amended, and this was expected to produce substantial financial savings. At the same time there were other important changes that had implications for the functioning of SHAs: * Span of control ‚Äì the number of PCTs was reduced to 152 from 302 in 2002 (although there had been a continuous process of mergers). At the same time, an increasing number of providers were achieving foundation trust status. Both of these changed the nature of the relationships of the intermediate layer to local organisations. * Reporting relationships ‚Äì the role of CEO of the NHS and Permanent Secretary of the DH were separated and the reporting relationship for SHA CEOs moved to directly report to the NHS CEO. * Top team changes ‚Äì the top management team was reduced in size from over 50 during the early part of the period to a much more manageable number, and this was accompanied by the development of procedures to reduce the traffic of policies, instructions and requests for information to the service from the centre. The period from 2006 saw financial control being restored and key targets were generally achieved. However, further questions about the effectiveness of SHAs and the regulatory process more generally were raised by the 2008 scandal at Mid Staffordshire Hospitals Foundation Trust. During 2009, SHAs were subject to an assurance process to examine their performance, role in developing their systems and to give developmental feedback. David Nicholson, NHS Chief Executive, said that the recession was one of several factors that had changed the context: \\"Part of the reason for doing it is that the SHAs' responsibilities are changing as we speak\\", he said at the time. SHAs in this period were expected to develop a more directly strategic approach than was the case in the earlier period, following the launch of Lord Darzi's 'Next Stage Review' report in 2008. There were some examples of successful strategic changes being introduced e.g. the implementation of trauma networks, the redesign of stroke services in London, and changes to the shape of services in Manchester, But many strategic issues remained unresolved. This was not helped by the period having an election followed by the introduction of stricter controls on reconfiguration by the incoming government and then an almost two year period of uncertainty when the government announced its intention to abolish SHAs in May 2010. This led to SHAs being 'clustered' from ten to four in October 2011. = Abolition = Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts were abolished on 31 March 2013 as part of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Facilities owned by SHAs were transferred to NHS Property Services, and their public health functions to Public Health England.  Role  Each SHA area contained various NHS trusts which took responsibility for running or commissioning local NHS services, and the SHA was responsible for strategic supervision of these services.

The station went on the air with 10 watts on October 15, 1972. Following efforts by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to encourage as many Class D stations as possible to increase power, a campaign was raised by the students of the college, and in the late 1970s, the FCC granted a license for a 110-watt, directional, transmission.

Many episodes later graduated to their own series, including Steptoe and Son, Meet the Wife, Till Death Us Do Part, All Gas and Gaiters, Up Pompeii!, Not in Front of the Children, Me Mammy, That's Your Funeral, The Liver Birds, Are You Being Served? and Last of the Summer Wine, which is the world's longest running sitcom, having run from January 1973 to August 2010. In March 2014, it was announced that Comedy Playhouse would make a return that year with three new episodes. Background The series began in 1961 at the prompting of Tom Sloan, Head of BBC Light Entertainment at the time. Galton and Simpson were no longer writing for Tony Hancock and Sloan asked them to write ten one-offs with the hope that one might become established as a series.Radio Times, 25 March 1971 Thus, the first two series of Comedy Playhouse were written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, but after that the episodes were written by various writers. In all, 27 series started from a pilot in the Comedy Playhouse. The first eight series were in black-and-white, with the rest being in colour. Like many television programmes from the time, many of 1960s episodes are missing presumed wiped. In Australia the series was broadcast on ABC Television in the early 1960s-late 1970s.

Early life Britton was born in New Dorp in Staten Island, New York to Jasper Alexander Hamilton Britton and Harriet Lord Turner. His parents wanted him to study religion, but he was attracted to nature study at an early age. He was a graduate of the Columbia University School of Mines and afterwards taught geology and botany at Columbia University. He joined the Torrey Botanical Club soon after graduation and was a member his entire life. He married Elizabeth Gertrude Knight, a bryologist, on August 27, 1885. They had met when she joined the club and were lifelong collaborators in botanical research. New York Botanical Garden During their honeymoon in 1888, they visited Kew Gardens, which led to his wife proposing a botanical garden for New York at a Torrey Club meeting. Together, they campaigned to bring about the NYBG. Britton left Columbia in 1895 to become the first director of the New York Botanical Garden, a position he held until 1929. He was on the first Board of Managers for the institution, along with Andrew Carnegie, J. Pierpont Morgan, and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. He engendered substantial financial support for the botanical garden by naming plants after wealthy contributors. Scientific research Much of his field work was done in the Caribbean, where he visited frequently when the winter weather in New York City became too severe. His contributions to the study of Caribbean flora are undisputed. He wrote Illustrated Flora of the Northern United States, Canada, and the British Possessions (1896) with Addison Brown, and The Cactaceae with Joseph Nelson Rose. Britton is also remembered as one of the signatories of the American Code of Botanical Nomenclature * that proposed such radical changes to the rules governing nomenclature that a compromise was not reached (and some of the principal American provisions adopted) until nearly 30 years later. Death and legacy He died at his home in the Bronx, after suffering a stroke 9 weeks earlier. The house he lived and worked in, the Britton Cottage, is preserved at Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island. The genera Brittonastrum, Brittonella, Brittonamra, Brittonia, and Brittonrosea, and the journal Brittonia are named after him.  Works John Hendley Barnhart contributed a bibliography of all of Britton's works to Biographical memoir of Nathaniel Lord Britton, 1859-1934 authored by Elmer Drew Merrill and presented to the National Academy of Sciences at the annual meeting, 1938. In 1960, Henry A. Gleason published The scientific work of Nathanial Lord Britton, where he summarized and provided commentary on Britton's early botanical activities, botanical organizations, his nomenclatural work, the Illustrated Flora, his leadership of the New York Botanical Garden, his West Indian Flora, his North America Flora, his Flora of Northern South America, his North American Trees, and his monographic work.

Note the 6-armed \\"starfish\\" hubs holding circular white tape reels in place. The vertical aluminium block above each pair of tape reels holds the read/write heads. DECtape, originally called Microtape, is a magnetic tape data storage medium used with many Digital Equipment Corporation computers, including the PDP-6, PDP-8, LINC-8, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, and the PDP-15. On DEC's 32-bit systems, VAX/VMS support for it was implemented but did not become an official part of the product lineup. DECtapes are 3/4 inch (19 mm) wide, and formatted into blocks of data that can each be read or written individually. Each tape stores 184K 12-bit PDP-8 words or 144K 18-bit words. Block size is 128 12-bit words (for the 12-bit machines), or 256 18-bit words for the other machines (16, 18, 32, or 36 bit systems). From a programming point of view,A file system was developed for it, and is included in the PDP-6 monitor because the system is block-oriented and allows random seeking, DECtape behaves like a very slow disk drive.A PDP-6 using only DECtape, that formerly supported 4-6 timesharing users could, with a single disk drive, support up to 30 users - p.35, Volume 1, Number 1, The DEC Professional (magazine) Origins DECtape has its origin in the LINCtape tape system, which was originally designed by Wesley Clark at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an integral part of the LINC computer. There are simple LINC instructions for reading and writing tape blocks using a single machine instruction.Mary Allen Wilkes and Wesley A. Clark, 18: Magnetic Tape Instructions, Programming the LINC, LINC Volume 16, Section 2, June, 1965; pages 80-104. The design of the LINC, including LINCtape, was placed in the public domain because its development had been funded by the government. LINCtape drives were manufactured by several companies, including Digital. In turn, LINCtape's origin can be found in the magnetic tape system for the historic Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer, designed by Richard L. Best and T. C. Stockebrand. The TX-2 Tape System is the direct ancestor of LINCtape, including the use of two redundant sets of five tracks and a direct drive tape transport, but it uses a physically incompatible tape format (¬Ω-inch Tape on 10-inch reels, where LINC tape and DECtape used ¬æ-inch tape on 4-inch reels).R. L. Best and T. C. Stockerbrand, A Computer-Integrated Rapid Access Magnetic Tape System with Fixed Address, Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference: Contrasts in Computers, May 6‚Äì8, 1958; pages 42-46.Herbert R. Johnson, Tape reels and hubs - \\"fit\\" section of LINC, LINCtape, DECtape, November 26, 2013. Digital initially introduced the Type 550 Microtape Control and Type 555 Dual Microtape Transport as peripherals for the PDP-1 and PDP-4 computers, both 18-bit machines. DEC advertised the availability of these peripherals in March and May, 1963, and by November, planning was already underway to offer the product for the 12-bit PDP-5 and 36-bit PDP-6, even though this involved a change in recording format.Levin H. Campbell, Court ruling, Digital Equipment Corporation, Plaintiff, Appellant, v. Sidney A. Diamond, Etc., et al., 653 F.2d 701 (1st Cir. 1981), June 12, 1981; see paragraph 5 for the chronology of introduction.Leonard M. Hantman, Microtape: Its Features and Applications, Second Annual Meeting of the Digital Equipment Corporation User's Society (DECUS), Lawrence Radiation Laboratories, Livermore, Nov. 18-19, 1963; see the Future Trends section, page 15. The initial specifications for the Type 550 controller discuss a significant advance beyond the LINCtape, the ability to read and write in either direction.555/550 Micro-Tape Dual Transport & Tape Control, Digital Equipment Corporation, May, 1963. By late 1964, the Type 555 transport was being marketed as a DECtape transport.555 DECtape Dual Transport, Digital Equipment Corporation, H-555, Dec. 1964; The start of Chapter 1 contains the term 'DECtape'. The tape transport used on the LINC is essentially the same as the Type 555 transport, with the same interface signals and the same physical tape medium. The LINC and DEC controllers, however, are incompatible, and the positions of the supply and take-up reels were reversed between the LINC and DEC tape formats. While LINCtape supports high-speed bidirectional block search, it only supports actual data read and write operations in the forward direction. DECtape uses a significantly different mark track format to provide for the possibility of read and write operations in either direction, although not all DECtape controllers support reverse read. DEC applied for a patent on the enhanced features incorporated into DECtape in late 1964.Thomas C. Stockebrand, Bidirectional Retrieval of Magnetically Recorded Data, , issued June 4, 1968. It is notable that the inventor listed on this patent, Thomas Stockebrand, is also an author of the paper on the TX-2 tape system from which the LINC tape was derived. Eventually, the TC12-F tape controller on the PDP-12 supported both LINCtape and DECtape on the same transport. As with the earlier LINC-8, the PDP-12 is a PDP-8 augmented with hardware support for the LINC instruction set and associated laboratory peripherals.  Technical details  A partially restored LINC-8, including LINCtape drives. DECtape was designed to be reliable and durable enough to be used as the main storage medium for a computer's operating system (OS). It is possible, although slow, to use a DECtape drive to run a small OS such as OS/8 or OS/12. The system would be configured to put temporary swap files on a second DECtape drive, so as to not slow down access to the main drive holding the system programs. Upon its introduction, DECtape was considered a major improvement over hand-loaded paper tapes, which could not be used to support swap files essential for practical timesharing. Early hard disk and drum drives were very expensive, limited in capacity, and notoriously unreliable, so the DECtape was a breakthrough in supporting the first timesharing systems on DEC computers. The legendary PDP-1 at MIT, where early computer hacker culture developed, adopted multiple DECtape drives to support a primitive software sharing community. The hard disk system (when it was working) was considered a \\"temporary\\" file storage device used for speed, not to be trusted to hold files for long-term storage. Computer users would keep their own personal work files on DECtapes, as well as software to be shared with others. The design of DECtape and its controllers is quite different from any other type of tape drive or controller at the time. The tape is wide, accommodating 6 data tracks, 2 mark tracks, and 2 clock tracks, with data recorded at roughly 350 bits per inch (138 bits per cm). Each track is paired with a non-adjacent track for redundancy by wiring the tape heads in parallel; as a result the electronics only deal with 5 tracks: a clock track, a mark track and 3 data tracks. Manchester encoding (PE) was used. The clock and mark tracks are written only once, when the tape was formatted; after that, they are read-only.TU55 DECtape 55 Instruction Manual, DEC-00-HZTA-D, Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard Mass., Sept. 1968; sections 1.4 and 1.5. This meant a \\"drop-out\\" on one channel could be tolerated; even a hole punched through the tape with a hole punch will not cause the read to fail. Another reason for DECtape's unusually high reliability is the use of laminated tape: the magnetic oxide is sandwiched between two layers of mylar, rather than being on the surface as was common in other magnetic tape types. This allows the tape to survive many thousands of passes over the tape heads without wearing away the oxide layer, which would otherwise have occurred in heavy swap file use on timesharing systems. The fundamental durability and reliability of DECtape was underscored when the design of the tape reel mounting hubs was changed in the early 1970s. The original machined metal hub with a retaining spring was replaced by a lower cost single-piece plastic hub with 6 flexible arms in a \\"starfish\\" or \\"flower\\" shape. When a defective batch of these new design hubs was shipped on new DECtape drives, these hubs would loosen over time. As a result, DECtape reels would fall off the drives, usually when being spun at full speed, as in an end-to-end seek. The reel of tape would fall onto the floor and roll in a straight line or circle, often unspooling and tangling the tape as it went. In spite of this horrifying spectacle, desperate users would carefully untangle that tape and wind it laboriously back onto the tape reel, then re-install it onto the hub, with a paper shim to hold the reel more tightly. The data on the mangled DECtape could often be recovered completely and copied to another tape, provided that the original tape had only been creased multiple times, and not stretched or broken. DEC quickly issued an Engineering Change Order (ECO) to replace the defective hubs, to resolve the problem.DECtape reliability? Eventually, a heavily used or abused DECtape begins to become unreliable. The operating system is usually programmed to keep retrying a failed read operation, which often succeeds after multiple attempts. Experienced DECtape users learned to notice the characteristic \\"shoe-shining\\" motion of a failing DECtape as it is passed repeatedly back and forth over the tape heads, and would retire the tape from further use.  On non-DEC computers  COI LINC Tape II drive. Computer Operations Inc (COI) of Beltsville, Maryland offered a DECtape clone in the 1970s. Initially, COI offered LINC-tape drives for computers made by Data General, Hewlett-Packard and Varian, with only passing reference to its similarity to DECtape.Linc Tapes, Operating System Give Users I/O Paper Tape Option, Computerworld, Dec. 20, 1972; page 15.Varian 610s Gain Direct-Access Tapes, Computerworld, Oct. 17, 1973; page 19. While DECtape and LINC tape are physically interchangeable, the data format COI initially used for 16-bit minicomputers was distinct from both the format used by the LINC and the format used on DECtape.CO 600 NP LINC Tape System for Nova Computers, Computer Operations, Inc., Beltsville, MD, Nov. 24, 1971, Doc. No. 112; Section 9.0 describes the tape format. When COI offered the LINC Tape II with support for the DEC PDP-8, PDP-11, Data General Nova, Interdata 7/32, HP 2100, Honeywell 316 and several other computers in 1974, the drive was priced at $1995 and was explicitly advertised as being DECtape compatible.LINC Tape II - Direct Access Mini-Computer Mass Storage System, Computer Operations Inc., Sept. 1974; 5 pages.Low Cost Tape Drives made for DEC, DG Gear, Computerworld, June 4, 1975; page 33.COI Showing Mass Storage Units, Computer World, May 31, 1976; page 56. In 1974, DEC charged COI with patent infringement. COI, in turn, filed a suit claiming that DEC's patent was invalid on several grounds, including the assertions that DEC had marketed DECtape-based equipment for over a year before filing for the patent, that they had failed to properly disclose the prior art, and that the key claims in the DEC patent were in the public domain. The US Patent and Trademark Office ruled DEC's patent invalid in 1978.Martha Blumenthal, Fraud Ruled in 1968 DEC Tape Patent, Computerworld, May 1, 1978; page 65. The court case continued into the 1980s.Rya W. Zobel, Memorandum of Decision, Digital Equip. Corp. v. Parker, April 2, 1980.Levin H.

DECtape II  DECtape (top and lower left) and DECtape II (lower right) removable magnetic media DECtape II was introduced around 1978 and has a similar block structure, but uses a much smaller tape (the same width as an audio compact cassette). The tape is packaged in a special, pre-formatted DC150 miniature cartridge consisting of a clear plastic cover mounted on a textured aluminum plate. Cartridge dimensions are . The TU58 DECtape II drive has an RS232 serial interface, allowing it to be used with the ordinary serial ports that are very common on Digital's contemporary processors. Because of its low cost, the TU58 was fitted to several different systems (including the VT103, PDP-11/24 and /44 and the VAX-11/730 and /750) as a DEC-standard device for software product distribution, and for loading diagnostic programs and microcode. The first version of the TU58 imposed very severe timing constraints on the unbuffered UARTs then being used by Digital, but a later firmware revision eased the flow-control problems. The RT11 single-user operating system can be bootstrapped from a TU58, but the relatively slow access time of the tape drive makes use of the system challenging to an impatient user. Like its predecessor DECtape, and like the faster RX01 floppies used on the VAX-11/780, a DECtape II cartridge has a capacity of about 256 kilobytes. Unlike the original DECtape media, DECtape II cartridges cannot be formatted on the tape drive transports sold to end-users, and have to be purchased in a factory pre-formatted state. The TU58 is also used with other computers, such as the Automatix Autovision machine vision system and AI32 robot controller. TU58 driver software is available for modern PCs running DOS.TU58 Driver Early production TU58s suffered from some reliability and data interchangeability problems, which were eventually resolved. However, rapid advances in low-cost floppy disk technology, which had an inherent speed advantage, soon outflanked the DECtape II and rendered it obsolete.

In 1969, he unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party. Life and career Edmonds was born in Toronto, Ontario, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1959. He began doctorate studies at the London School of Economics. He left his graduate studies, never to return, to take a job in Ottawa as an executive assistant with the office of Liberal Opposition Leader Lester Pearson, the future Prime Minister. He next worked as a professor of political studies at Carleton University, and became a Dean of Residence at Carleton. He played a major role in organizing the Company of Young Canadians in 1965. He also worked for CUSO, and for Crossroads Africa in the 1960s. From 1963-66 he was Executive Assistant to Paul Martin Sr. in the Department of External Affairs and he chaired Paul Martin Sr.'s unsuccessful leadership campaign in 1968 (Sawatsky, pp. 65‚Äì66). Although Edmonds had no legislative experience, he was the primary opposition to Robert Bend at the 1969 Liberal convention. Some youth delegates were seen burning their membership cards after Bend's victory was announced. Edmonds ran in the Winnipeg-area riding of Charleswood in the 1969 provincial election, but lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Arthur Moug by over a thousand votes. Edmonds retired from active politics after this loss. He worked as a consultant and lobbyist in Ottawa during much of the 1970s, first on his own, and then as a co-founder of the firm Public Affairs International, along with Torrance Wylie (Sawatsky, pp. 67‚Äì77). With PAI a success, Edmonds then took a job as senior policy advisor to federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark in 1977 (Sawatsky, p. 79). Edmonds developed advanced concepts around free trade in North America, but Clark did not pursue this initiative (Sawatsky, pp. 85‚Äì86). Edmonds left this job after one year, to return to consulting work with his own firm. The free trade ideas developed by Edmonds would have to wait another decade, for Brian Mulroney's rule, to become reality. Clark became Prime Minister in 1979 but was defeated in 1980; during that time, Edmonds continued to advise Clark on an informal basis. Edmonds returned as senior policy adviser to Defence Minister Robert Coates, when the Tories regained power in September 1984. But Coates had to resign in early 1985 over an ill-advised visit to a strip club in West Germany while on official business; this escapade constituted a security risk. Edmonds reported the details of this and other matters to senior Canadian civil servants. Mulroney was annoyed that Edmonds had acted as a whistle-blower on Coates, and blacklisted Edmonds from government. This scandal, so soon after the Mulroney government had taken power, foreshadowed the many Tory scandals to come in the years ahead (Sawatsky, pp. 288‚Äì296). Edmonds continued to work in the field of international development, and wrote a book on Canada-United States relations in the mid-1980s. He served as a professor and Chairman of Canadian Studies at Yale University, starting from 1986 to 1988. He was later named Vice Chairman of the McRae Group of Companies, a real estate and development firm based in Arizona and California.

The Hoito has operated continuously on 314 Bay Street, in the historic Bay & Algoma neighbourhood, for more than a century and is perhaps the oldest co- operatively owned and operated restaurant in Canada. Beginnings The name \\"Hoito\\" is Finnish for the word \\"care\\". The idea for the restaurant came about in a logging camp outside Nipigon, Ontario. IWW union organizer A.T. Hill had come to organize the camp into the union and promote the new Finnish-Canadian socialist newspaper Vapaus (Freedom). After winning some improvements in the camp, the workers expressed a concern that while being able to find cheap accommodation in the city of Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay), they were unable to find reasonably priced, home-cooked meals. The request to open a co- operative restaurant was taken to the board of directors of the Finnish Labour Temple and approved. 59 people pooled their money together in the form of 5-dollar ‚Äúcomrade loans‚Äù. Union organizer A.T. Hill was chosen as the restaurant's first manager. For several decades, workers in the restaurant belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union and later to the Canadan Teollisuusunionistinen Kannatusliitto (CTKL or Support League of Canadian Industrial Unionists), the Finnish section of the union, and not, as is often mistaken, to the Communist Party of Canada. The IWW was active in the bushcamps in Northwestern Ontario primarily among Finnish-Canadian bushworkers, and effectively operated as a radical alternative to their rivals in the communist-led unions. The Finnish Labour Temple itself was the Canadian administration for the IWW for a number of years. When IWW organizer J. A. McDonald visited the Hoito and Finnish Labour Temple in 1926, \\"it was the activities of the women that he was most impressed by. According to McDonald all the waitresses were members of the IWW, and one of the cooks was a woman who had served a year in a Finnish prison for her activities on behalf of the Reds during the Finnish Revolution of 1918.\\". Food Hoito pancakes with eggs and bacon The Hoito Restaurant is best known for the Finnish pancakes they serve to their customers. Thin and the size of a large dinner plate, they are eaten with maple syrup, strawberry sauce or a sprinkle of sugar. Known as lettu or l√§tty in Finnish, depending on what part of Finland one is from, they are one of the traditional Finnish foods served at the Hoito. Other items prepared include viili (a sour yogurt), Karelian pasty (karjalanpiirakka), Karelian hot pot (karjalanpaisti), salmon-potato casserole (lohiperunalaatikko), pulla (sweet cardamon bread), salted fish (suolakala), rice pudding (riisipuuro), fish soup (kalakeitto), pea soup (hernekeitto) and Vienna sausage (nakki). Another well-known dish is mojakka, a stew of beef, potatoes and turnips that is seasoned with allspice. The word mojakka is not a Finnish word at all, but a term that was coined by the Hoito staff themselves. Co-operative restaurant Since the restaurant began in 1918, it has operated as a consumer co-operative along Rochdale Principles. Customers can buy yearly membership cards that enable them to vote at the Finnish Labour Temple annual general membership meeting, where the board of directors is chosen for one to two year terms. Workers maintain a degree of workers' self- management and organize their own work schedules. Customers The Hoito is a popular place with locals in Thunder Bay, with line-ups for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Clientele from all walks of life can be found at the Hoito, ranging from students and blue collar workers, to visiting celebrities, politicians and newsmakers. Until the 1970s, the dining room featured long communal tables, and customers were able to buy meal tickets. Today, the restaurant operates in a more conventional way, with individual tables and several small communal tables.

It was founded in the aftermath of the Norman conquest of England when William the Conqueror (1066‚Äì1087) ordered its construction because he wished to have a fortified place in the town of Norwich. It proved to be one of his two castles in East Anglia, the other being Wisbech. In 1894 the Norwich Museum moved to Norwich Castle and it has been a museum ever since. The museum & art gallery holds significant objects from the region, especially works of art, archaeological finds and natural history specimens. The castle is one of the city's Norwich 12 heritage sites. History Norwich Castle was founded by William the Conqueror some time between 1066 and 1075. It originally took the form of a motte and bailey. Early in 1067, William the Conqueror embarked on a campaign to subjugate East Anglia, and according to military historian R. Allen Brown it was probably around this time that the castle was founded. It was first recorded in 1075, when Ralph de Gael, Earl of Norfolk, rebelled against William the Conqueror and Norwich was held by his men. A siege was undertaken, but ended when the garrison secured promises that they would not be harmed. Norwich is one of 48 castles mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086. Building a castle in a pre- existing settlement necessitated the destruction of existing properties. At Norwich, estimates vary that between 17 and 113 houses occupied the site of the castle. Excavations in the late 1970s discovered that the castle bailey was built over a Saxon cemetery. The historian Robert Liddiard remarks that \\"to glance at the urban landscape of Norwich, Durham or Lincoln is to be forcibly reminded of the impact of the Norman invasion\\". Until the construction of Orford Castle in the mid-12th century under Henry II, Norwich was the only major royal castle in East Anglia. Charles Knight's Old England: A Pictorial Museum (1845). The stone keep, which still stands today, was probably built between 1095 and 1110. In about the year 1100, the motte was made higher and the surrounding ditch deepened. During the Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174, in which Henry II's sons rebelled against him and started a civil war, Norwich Castle was put in a state of readiness. Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk was one of the more powerful earls who joined the revolt against Henry. With 318 Flemish soldiers that landed in England in May 1174, and 500 of his own men, Bigod advanced on Norwich Castle. They captured it and took fourteen prisoners who were held for ransom. When peace was restored later that year, Norwich was returned to royal control. The Normans introduced the Jews to Norwich and they lived close to the castle. A cult was founded in Norwich in the wake of the murder of a young boy, William of Norwich, for which the Jews of the city were blamed. In Lent 1190, violence against Jews erupted in East Anglia and on 6 February (Shrove Tuesday) it spread to Norwich. Some fled to the safety of the castle, but those who did not were killed in their hundreds. The Pipe Rolls, records of royal expenditure, note that repairs were carried out at the castle in 1156‚Äì1158 and 1204‚Äì1205. The castle was used as a prison for felons and debtors from 1220, with additional buildings constructed on the top of the motte next to the keep. The prison reformer John Howard visited it six times between 1774 and 1782. These buildings were demolished and rebuilt between 1789 and 1793 by Sir John Soane, and more alterations were made in 1820. The use of the castle as a gaol ended in 1887, when it was bought by the city of Norwich to be used as a museum. The conversion was undertaken by Edward Boardman and the museum opened in 1895. =Refacing of the keep= Edward Thomas Daniell, Norwich Castle - before the restoration of 1834 (Norfolk Museums Collections) The forebuilding attached to the keep was pulled down in 1825. Although the keep remains, its outer shell has been repaired repeatedly, most recently in 1835‚Äì9 by Anthony Salvin, with James Watson as mason using Bath stone. None of the inner or outer bailey buildings survive, and the original Norman bridge over the inner ditch was replaced in about the year 1825. During the renovation, the keep was completely refaced based faithfully on the original ornamentation., plate XXXII The etcher and watercolourist Edward Thomas Daniell, who was one of the vociferous opponents of the proposed refacing. One of the letters he wrote about the subject appeared in the Norwich Mercury in August 1830, and referred to the \\"scandalous re-facing of the ancient keep\\". Although living in London during this period, his letters to his friends the artist Henry Ninham and his friend the botanist Dawson Turner reveal the extent of his opposition. In a letter to Turner, Daniell wrote, \\"I have had a very beautiful drawing made of it, and I mean to etch it the size of the drawing. I can only say that if my etching be half as much like the castle, or half as good as the drawing, it will be more like, than anything yet done, of that very beautiful relic.\\" To Ninham he wrote, \\"Show me by a plan, how high they have got pulling down, and enable me to judge whether even now in the eleventh hour, any good can be done; and I in return will just inform you, how I stand with regard to my plate. It stands precisely as it did when I left Norwich.\\" His etching of the old keep, however, was never completed, and the refacing went ahead and was successfully completed. Present day Part of the Snettisham Hoard on display in the museum. The castle remains a museum and art gallery today and still contains many of its first exhibits, as well as many more recent ones. Two galleries feature the museum's fine art collection, including costume, textiles, jewellery, glass, ceramics and silverware, and a large display of ceramic teapots. Other gallery themes include Anglo-Saxons (including the Harford Farm Brooch). Norwich Castle and cattle market at the end of the 19th century The fine art galleries include works from the 17th to 20th centuries, and include English watercolour paintings, Dutch landscapes and modern British paintings. The castle also houses a good collection of the work of the Flemish artist Peter Tillemans. Norwich Castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade I listed building. Visitors can tour the castle keep and learn about the castle through interactive displays. Separate tours are also available of the dungeon and the battlements. Although not permanently on display, one of the largest collections it holds is the butterfly collection of Margaret Fountaine. An unusual artefact is the needlework done by Lorina Bulwer at the turn of the twentieth century whilst she was confined in a workhouse. The work has featured on the BBC.BBC Documentary 2015 - Antiques Roadshow Detectives 2 Lorina Bulwer, BBC, retrieved 11 April 2015 Architecture G. T. Clark, a 19th-century antiquary and engineer, described Norwich's great tower as \\"the most highly ornamented keep in England\\". It was faced with Caen stone over a flint core. The keep is some by and high, and is of the hall-keep type, entered at first floor level through an external structure called the Bigod Tower. The exterior is decorated with blank arcading. Castle Rising is the only other comparable keep in this respect. Internally, the keep has been gutted so that nothing remains of its medieval layout. The uncertainty surrounding the keep's arrangement has led to scholarly debate. What is agreed on is that it had a complex domestic arrangement, with a kitchen, chapel, a two-storey high hall, and 16 latrines. Exhibit highlights The Paston Treasure c.1663 oil on canvas 165 x 246.5 cm The Paston Treasure is a painting commissioned around 1663 either by Sir William Paston (1610-1663), or by his son Robert (1631-1683). The identity of the artist is unknown, however it is likely that it was a Dutch artist working in a studio at the principal residence of the Pastons at Oxnead. The artwork can be placed within the mid- seventeenth century Dutch still life tradition, with elements that conform to the genre of vanitas. Still life paintings usually feature one or two objects which are artists' stock items, included only for their symbolism. On the other hand, the majority of the objects represented in The Paston Treasure were all real, as they correspond to an existing item in the inventories of the Pastons'. Therefore, not only it was commissioned as a memento mori, but also as a record for the family's wealth and own collections. It was also meant to be commemorative of the death of a family member, probably William Paston. The painting debuted in America with an exhibition held at the Yale Center For British Art. Now it is currently in display at the Castle, in The Paston Treasure Riches & Rarities of the Known World exhibition curated by Francesca Vanke, which reunites for the first time in 350 years the painting with some of the objects depicted. The Happisburgh Handaxe. Flint. 12.2 x 7.8 cm. Norwich Castle Museum The Happisburgh hand axe is made of flint, and measures 12.2 cm x 7.8 cm. The discovery of this Lower Palaeolithic hand axe in 2000 along the Norfolk coast at Happisburgh transformed our understanding of early human occupation in Britain. Dated and shown to be from 550,000 to 700,000 years old, it is now the oldest human-made object in North Europe, doubling the known duration of human occupation in Britain. Analysis of pollen in the silt allowed the archaeologists to build a picture of temperate woodland with the existence of pine, alder, oak, elm and hornbeam trees in evidence at the time the handaxe was made. The Cavalry Parade Helmet and Visor was found in the River Wensum at Worthing in 1947 and 1950 respectively. The items, of Roman origin, date to the first half of the third century CE. They are an important testimony of the presence of Roman army personnel in central Norfolk during the later period of the Roman occupation. The helmet is made from a single sheet of gilded bronze, highly decorated as to represent a feathered eagle's head on the crest, foliate-tailed beasts on either side and a plain triangular front panel with feather borders on either side at the top, with the lower ends terminating in birds' heads. The visor mask complements the helmet by carrying similar repouss√© decoration, depicting Mars on one side and Victory on the other. These two objects are not a fitting pair, although they can be considered together as each would have originally had been coupled with a similar complementary object. Spong Man. AD 500-600. Height 14.0 cm. Norwich Castle Museum. The unique Anglo-Saxon ceramic figurine now known as Spong Man was found in 1979 in Spong Hill. The figure is shown sat on a chair decorated with incised panelling and is leaning forwards with head in hands wearing a round flat hat. It is likely to have once sat on the lid of a pagan funerary urn and is a unique object in North Western Europe. Although it is labelled as a man, its gender is unclear, as there are no distinctive anatomic details. Exactly why this figurine was created is still a mystery. It is the earliest Anglo-Saxon three-dimensional figure ever found. It may be a representation of a deity whose identity is now lost, but it is still a great artifact that reminds us how little we know about religion in this early migration period across northern Europe. Also known as neck-rings, torcs were a characteristic kind of jewel used in the Iron Age across Europe. They would have been worn by prominent people within society as a symbol of status and power. The rare tubular gold torc known as the Gold Tubular Torc came from the Snettisham Treasure. It was found in 1948 at Snettisham, alongside a large number of other torcs, carefully disposed in the ground, confirming that burial rituals had great significance within the people of Late Iron Age Norfolk. Also known as The Seven Sorrows of Mary, the Ashwellthorpe Triptych has significant connections with South Norfolk and its long trading tradition with Holland. This Flemish altarpiece was commissioned by the Norfolk family of the Knyvettes of Ashwellthorpe. Christopher Knyvettes was sent by King Henry VIII to the Netherlands in 1512, when he commissioned this painting to Master of the Legend of the Magdalen. Both Christopher and his wife Catherina are represented kneeling to Mary, mother of Jesus in the foreground of the composition, showing their religious devotion and wealth. Dragons in England are famous through the legend of Saint George, however, they have always been particular important in Norwich since the medieval period. The Norwich Snapdragon was made to reflect the civil power and wealth of the city within Norfolk and was used during a procession which combined the celebration of the city's saint and the installation of the new major of the town. The Snapdragon at the Norwich Castle, known as Snap, is the last complete example of the civic snapdragon. Like all others, it was built to contain one person, its body is made of basketwork, painted with gold and red scales over a green body and red underside, while the person's legs were hidden within a canvas 'skirt'. Norwich River: Afternoon by the Norwich School of Painters artist John Crome. The Norwich Society of Artists was founded in 1803 by Crome and Robert Ladbrooke and brought together professional painters and drawing masters such as John Sell Cotman, James Stark, George Vincent as well as other talented amateur artists, who were often inspired by the East Anglian landscape, and were influenced by Dutch landscape painters. This oil on canvas is considered one of the finest works made by Crome. It depicts the River Wensum, near New Mills, at St Martin's Oak, close to where the artist lived, in Norwich. The Norfolk Regiment First World War Casualty Book is a unique graphic record of the Norfolk Regiment's participation in the First World War. It records details of more than 15,000 soldiers from the regular and service battalions in 1914 to their return home in 1919. Each entry of the book contains the soldier's name, service number, battalion and details of their health. It also records those who perished in action. Part of a quartet of rare examples of English medieval art, the stained-glass roundel depicting December is an example of the Norwich School of stained-glass. It shows clear Flemish influences, and it is possible that it has been made by one of the Norwich Strangers, immigrants of the sixteenth century from the Low Countries. It is thought to have been made for the Major Thomas Pykerell's house. originally there would have been twelve roundels depicting the Labours of The Months, a popular pageant in Norwich during that period. This roundel in particular depicts the King of Christmas. Of the original twelve only four now survive, depicting December, September, probably March and either April or November.

Major League career After being drafted by the Dodgers in 1968, Alexander debuted in the big leagues in 1971 with the team. He was traded, along with Bob O'Brien, Sergio Robles and Royle Stillman, to the Baltimore Orioles for Frank Robinson and Pete Richert in the offseason. Alexander enjoyed his first winning season with the Orioles in 1973, when he went 12‚Äì8 with a 3.86 ERA. Alexander was traded to the New York Yankees as part of a ten-player deal in the middle of the 1976 season and went 10‚Äì5 to help the Yankees win the American League East division. He did not pitch during the American League Championship Series, so he was tapped to start Game One of the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, which he lost. Alexander signed with the Texas Rangers as a free agent in the offseason and enjoyed one good year before falling apart. It would not be until he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1983 season, after being released by the New York Yankees, that he would return to form. The Blue Jays were on the rise in the mid 1980s, and Alexander was an instrumental part of their success, winning 17 games in both 1984 and 1985, including the division-clinching win over the Yankees in 1985. In the ALCS, however, he went 0‚Äì1 with an 8.71 earned run average in two starts as the Blue Jays fell to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. When Alexander negotiated his contract with the Blue Jays, the team refused to pay Alexander if he injured himself while hunting. Toronto lawyer Gord Kirke worked out a compromise in which Alexander would collect money while hurt, \\"only if he was following all hunting regulations and wearing an orange hunting jacket\\". A slow start the next year resulted in Alexander being traded to the Atlanta Braves, who dealt him in turn to the contending Detroit Tigers midway through the 1987 season for a then unknown minor-leaguer named John Smoltz. The Tigers got more than they could have possibly hoped for in Alexander, who went 9‚Äì0 with a 1.53 ERA to propel the Tigers to the division title. However, he struggled again in the ALCS, going 0‚Äì2 with a 10.00 ERA, bringing his postseason totals to 0‚Äì5 with an 8.38 ERA. The following year, Alexander went 14‚Äì11 with a 4.32 ERA, earning his only All-Star appearance. In 1989, his performance declined (6-18, 4.44 ERA) in part due to pitching with a fractured jaw. He retired following the season.

Tripoli in northern Lebanon. A clothes line or washing line is any type of rope, cord, or twine that has been stretched between two points (e.g. two sticks), outside or indoors, above the level of the ground. Clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or clothespins. Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies. Longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing. More elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape, with multiple lines being used (such as the Hills Hoist from Australia). Some can be folded up when not in use (although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught, so there is usually a safety button). In Scotland, many tenement buildings have a \\"drying green\\", which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines ‚Äì it may also be used as a recreational space - as well as a clothes horse connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather. Comparison with clothes dryer A rotary, or Hills Hoist, type of clothes line Sundrying in Hermiston, Oregon. Both clothes lines and clothes dryers serve the same purpose: drying clothes that have been recently washed, or that are wet in general. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using a clothes line instead of a mechanical dryer: =Advantages= * Saves money. * Zero greenhouse gas emissions per load (2 kg CO2eq of greenhouse gas emissions from the average mechanical clothes dryer per load). * Less fabric wear and tear. * Laundry items do not shrink (hot air from a mechanical clothes dryer may shrink items). * No static cling and no perfume smells throughout the neighborhood from fabric softener and anti-static dryer sheets. * Laundry items stay softer to the touch (mechanical clothes dryers tend to remove short, soft, fine fibers), and may be less wrinkled. * Laundry items often do not need ironing if line dried in a breeze. * Avoids the potential of airborne lint and reduced air quality. * Eliminates the noise from a mechanical clothes dryer. * Does not vent indoor air to the outside and waste the large volume of conditioned (heated or cooled) air that a mechanical dryer's blower does. * For a simple line drying arrangement (rope and clothes pins) the repair and replacement costs are about $20.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 2 cents per load. For non-commercial mechanical clothes drying the repair and replacement costs (including labor expenses) are about $200.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 20 cents per load. =Disadvantages= * Putting laundry on a line usually takes more time than putting it into a mechanical dryer (as laundry items have to be hung up and fixed one by one). * Laundry items need to be hung indoors during rainy weather, or may get wet if the weather changes. * Neighbors may find it aesthetically unpleasant. * Exposing dirty laundry can lessen privacy, showing information about inhabitants' living habits. * There may be a risk of theft or vandalism of clothes depending on where the clothes are hung. * Environmental contaminants such as soil, dust, smoke, automotive or industrial pollutants, pollen and bird and animal droppings can come in contact with clothing. * Clothespins can leave imprints (including rust from the spring) on the clothes. Drying laundry indoors Clothes drying indoors Laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including: * inclement weather * physical disability * lack of space for a line * reduce the damage to fabrics from sun's UV rays * legal restrictions * to raise the humidity level indoors, and lower the air temperature indoors * convenience * to preserve privacy Several types of devices are available for indoor drying. A drying rack or clotheshorse can help save space in an apartment, or clothes lines can be strung in the basement during the winter. Small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole. The drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct solar radiation and the convective assistance of the wind. The evaporation of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level, which may or may not be desirable. In cold, dry weather, moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable. In warm weather, increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter. Increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi, which can cause health problems. An average-sized wash load will convert approximately of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water, as follows. A typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water, after being spun in a laundry machine. To determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry, weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried. The difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them. Multiply that weight in kg by 2,257 kJ/kg,http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fluids-evaporation-latent-heat- d_147.html which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram, to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water, or multiply by 0.6250 kWh/kg to get kilowatt-hours. (Note: If the moisture later condenses inside the house, the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly.) Diamond, Sheldon R. (1970). Fundamental Concepts of Modern Physics. USA: AMSCO School Publications, Inc. pp. 205. \\"During evaporation... The surroundings thereby become the ultimate source of the energy required to change the phase of [water] from liquid to gas.\\" To obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation, the process can be traced on a psychrometric chart. Factors that determine the drying duration Various factors determine the duration of drying and can help to decide rather to use a drier or a clothes line * The environmental temperature - increase of temperature decreases the drying duration * The environmental humidity - decrease of humidity will decrease the drying duration * Wind velocity - Sometimes people put a fan near the clothes when drying them indoors * Direct sun - usually only the external line will be exposed to direct sun, so usually people put the thickest clothes on the most external line. * Cloth thickness Drying laundry in freezing conditions Laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point. First, the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff. Then the frost on the clothes will sublimate into the air, leaving the items dry. It takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors, but indoor drying removes heat from the air, so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency. Controversy in North America Controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass \\"right-to-dry\\" laws allowing their use. According to Ian Urbina, a reporter for The New York Times, \\"the majority of the 60 million people who now live in the country‚Äôs roughly 300,000 private communities\\" are forbidden from using outdoor clothes lines. , the states of Florida, Colorado,Chaker, Anne Marie (September 18, 2007) \\"The Right to Dry\\", The Wall Street Journal.Colorado Governor's Energy Office HOA Bill ‚Äì HB 1270 Hawaii, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin had passed laws forbidding bans on clothes lines, while Utah allows local jurisdictions to forbid such bans. At least eight states restrict homeowners' associations from forbidding the installation of solar-energy systems, and lawyers have debated whether or not those laws might apply to clothes lines. A British filmmaker, Steven Lake, was planning to release a documentary in 2011 titled Drying for Freedom about the clothes-line controversy in the United States. In Canada, the province of Nova Scotia's first NDP government passed An Act to Prevent Prohibitions on the Use of Clotheslines on December 10, 2010 to allow all homeowners in the province to use clotheslines, regardless of restrictive covenants. The province of Ontario lifted bans on clothes lines in 2008. Some affluent Canadian suburban municipalities such as Hampstead, Qu√©bec or Outremont, Qu√©bec prohibit clotheslines.

Important features of LEAP are dynamic WEP keys and mutual authentication (between a wireless client and a RADIUS server). LEAP allows for clients to re- authenticate frequently; upon each successful authentication, the clients acquire a new WEP key (with the hope that the WEP keys don't live long enough to be cracked). LEAP may be configured to use TKIP instead of dynamic WEP. Some 3rd party vendors also support LEAP through the Cisco Compatible Extensions Program. An unofficial description of the protocol is available.  Security considerations  Cisco LEAP, similar to WEP, has had well-known security weaknesses since 2003 involving offline password cracking. LEAP uses a modified version of MS-CHAP, an authentication protocol in which user credentials are not strongly protected. Stronger authentication protocols employ a salt to strengthen the credentials against eavesdropping during the authentication process. Cisco's response to the weaknesses of LEAP suggests that network administrators either force users to have stronger, more complicated passwords or move to another authentication protocol also developed by Cisco, EAP-FAST, to ensure security. Automated tools like ASLEAP demonstrate the simplicity of getting unauthorized access in networks protected by LEAP implementations.

The series is a sequel to the 1953 film The War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the 1898 novel of the same title by H. G. Wells, using the same war machine designs and often incorporating aspects from the film, radio adaptation, and the original novel into its mythology. Though the original film's producer, George Pal, envisioned a TV series from the same film sometime in the 1970s, it was not until the late 1980s that a series was finally realized, this time by television producer Greg Strangis. The show was a part of the boom of first-run syndicated television series being produced at the time. It was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Premise  According to the series, rather than being killed outright by germs at the end of the 1953 film, the aliens had all slipped into a state of suspended animation. Their bodies were stored away in toxic waste drums and shipped to various disposal sites within the United States (ten such sites are known to exist in the countryDumpsite locations are visible on a map from the episode \\"The Last Supper\\".), and a widespread government cover-up combined with a condition dubbed ‚Äúselective amnesia‚Äù has convinced most people that the invasion had never happened. Although the original movie narration had explicitly stated that the aliens were Martians (even featuring artwork indicating an alien city on the planet Mars), since 1953 the concept of vastly intelligent life on Mars had lost plausibility. In the series, the aliens are revealed to actually be from Mor-Tax‚Äîa garden planet 40 light-years away in the Taurus constellation orbiting a dying sun. Thirty-five years later, in 1988 (modern day when the series began), a terrorist group calling itself the People's Liberation Party accidentally irradiates the drums containing the aliens while raiding the dumpsite near Fort Jericho. The radiation destroys the bacteria that were keeping the aliens unconscious. Once free, the aliens take possession of the bodies of the six terrorists who overran the site. From there they use a series of human bodies and crudely adapted Earth technology to find means of appropriating the planet, both in removing humanity and developing a permanent means to inoculate themselves against the planet's indigenous bacteria. Their attempt to successfully make Earth into their new homeworld is imperative for in roughly five years, three million colonists from Mor-Tax are expected to arrive.  Plot  = First season = Opening narration (spoken in voice- over by Martin in character as Blackwood): Along with other sci-fi/horror series that ran in syndication in the late 1980s (such as Friday the 13th: The Series and Freddy's Nightmares), War of the Worlds constantly pushed the ‚Äúacceptable content‚Äù envelope, regularly featuring violence on par with the R-rated horror movies of the time. Gore is commonplace in the first season: dead aliens and their tossed-away hosts‚Äô bodies melt in a grotesque puddle and the ruthless Mor-Taxans have no compunctions about torturing or mutilating any human who gets in their way. One of their trademark methods of murder would be gouged-out eyes courtesy of the third arm that would often burst out from their chest. During the first season, the aliens are led by a triumvirate known as the Advocacy. They are a part of their society's ruling class, overseeing the invasion force on Earth while their leaders, the invisible and never heard Council, remain back on Mor-Tax. Outfitted throughout most of the season in contamination suits that pump coolant to counteract the killing heat of the radiation they need, they stay in their base of operation: a cavern in the Nevada desert, which is perfect due to the ambient radiation from atomic bomb tests. Due to the risks to their lives, they rarely venture into the outside world because without the Advocacy the lower classes would have no guidance and be useless. Their goal is to pick up where they left off in 1953 by making way on Earth for the three million colonists heading in exodus from their dying world. Their major objective in order to accomplish this terraforming is to remove humanity from the planet. The aliens‚Äô hatred of human beings goes beyond simple prejudice. Having come from a planet that can be compared to the Garden of Eden based on its description, the aliens see that humans do nothing but desecrate what they would call a paradise, and most importantly, a new home. Without humans in the way, they can restore the vegetation, and better replicate the conditions of their deceased world. To carry out a successful war, they seek out weapons (some of which are their own left behind from previous visitations), help amass their army, and engage in infiltration and all sorts of acts of warfare. But to make things more problematic, they must also find immunity against the germs that befell them in 1953. The simplicity of the alien invasion storyline is countered in the first season by the addition of anomalous entities whose motives are only partially explained: * Quinn: An alien trapped in a human host since the invasion of ‚Äô53, mysteriously immune to bacteria, and ready to play both of the major warring factions against each other for his own favor. * The Qar‚ÄôTo: An unknown alien race represented by a synthetic lifeform sent to Earth, they want the Mor-Taxans dead and humanity preserved, but for sinister reasons. * Project 9: A shadow government organization much like the Blackwood Project, but more interested in alien research than in resisting or countering the Mor- Taxan invasion plans. A number of recurring allies are presented for the Blackwood team. Sylvia Van Buren (a character from the George Pal film reprised by the original actress, Ann Robinson), who was a colleague of Dr. Forrester, has since the end of the war developed the ability to sense the aliens and is prone to fairly accurate precognitive visions. The aliens‚Äô scientific arsenal has little power over the supernatural powers of shaman Joseph Lonetree (whose presence is seemingly foreshadowed in the first episode). The team even makes friends with the remaining Grover's Mill militia of 1938 who had their own run-in with the aliens. A recurring element in the series is the number three. This is an extension of the film, wherein the aliens‚Äô physiology, technology and society are rooted in multiples of three: from their caste system (ruling class, soldiers, and scientists) to their bodies (three arms with three fingers), weaponry (in ‚ÄúThe Resurrection‚Äù, they make bolas with three weighted ends), and even their mating cycle is every nine years (three times three years). The appearance of the number in some form is sprinkled throughout the season in reference to the aliens. The episodes all had (often ironic) Biblical titles, such as \\"The Walls of Jericho\\", \\"To Heal the Leper\\", and \\"Among the Philistines\\". ‚ÄúTo Life Immortal‚Äù (too doe nakotaeThis spelling can be seen onscreen in \\"Among the Philistines\\" on Norton's computer monitor. Another spelling variation is visible as well, but it is not seen clearly enough. as it would be said in the aliens‚Äô native tongue), a phrase by which the aliens seem to sum up their belief system, is a common exchange between aliens, as a pledge to their shared goal or as a battle cry before honorable self-sacrifice. It later became a popular catchphrase among the show's fans. = Second season = Opening voice-over: The creative team of Season 1 was replaced, bringing in Frank Mancuso, Jr., who was also busy producing Friday the 13th: The Series. Many aspects of the show were retooled, such as the title sequence and music, and much of the black humor and Biblical references were removed. Norton and Ironhorse, two major characters from the first season, are killed off in the season premiere and replaced by mercenary John Kincaid (Adrian Paul). The modern-day setting of the first season shifted to a not-too-distant future of \\"Almost Tomorrow\\" where the world has since spiraled into a dismal state with its economy, environment, and government all beaten down. The antagonists of the first season are replaced by the Morthren, from Mothrai; while the first season aliens were said to be from the planet Mor-Tax, there is a half-hearted explanation for this change in the final episode. The Morthren exterminate all the aliens from the first season for their failure to eradicate humanity. Whereas bacteria and radiation are constant problems for the aliens in the first season, the Morthren have quickly found a cure-all means for this by transmutating into human bodies. With this, they forwent the ability to possess human bodies, retaining only one human body. These bodies are however easily damaged; as seen in the series a single bullet wound is enough to cause the aliens' human form to break down, killing them. Their equivalent of body- swapping is a cloning machine that makes exact copies of someone, only differing in that the duplicates would be loyal to the Morthren cause and their existence tied to the original. Ironically, as sores are the telltale signs of alien possession in the first season, a lack of scars or any physical flaw was a telltale sign of a clone, as the Morthren are fixated with perfection. While the Eternal is their god, the Morthren are led by Malzor (played by Denis Forest, who had a large part in the Season 1 episode ‚ÄúVengeance Is Mine‚Äù). Just under him was the scientist Mana (Catherine Disher, whose husband also played a major role in a Season 1 episode) with Ardix (Julian Richings who appeared briefly in ‚ÄúHe Feedeth Among the Lillies‚Äù) as her assistant. Meanwhile, with General Wilson missing, the Cottage destroyed, and two team members lost in battle, the remnants of the team, with mercenary Kincaid, seek shelter. They take up base in an underground hideout in the sewers. Some of the characters experience shifts, such as Harrison carrying a gun, becoming more sullen and losing his more quirky personality traits. The friction between the militaristic Ironhorse and the other team members was not transferred with Kincaid, who got along well with everyone, who themselves became more militaristic in season 2. The show's theme of warfare between two races, and all the issues that come with it, was replaced by a theme of a bleak life on a desolate world. Although the series was canceled after 14 episodes had been broadcast, six more episodes were completed. This also gave the production team the opportunity to create a finale, \\"The Obelisk\\", which offers a conclusive ending to the series as a whole.  Cast  = Main cast = An eclectic group is formed by the government to deal with the new alien threat, and the series follows their missions and adventures (and often failures) in fighting the aliens. The Blackwood Project, named after its central member, consists of the following: * Dr. Harrison Blackwood (Jared Martin): Astrophysicist whose parents were killed in the 1953 invasion. He was adopted following the events of the film by Dr. Clayton Forrester and Blackwood's character is played very much to resemble Forrester down to his demeanor, dress, and even his speech and appearance. He is a pacifist and a vegetarian, and is often seen practicing many alternative health techniques such as yoga during the first season, but becomes grittier in the second. * Dr. Suzanne McCullough (Lynda Mason Green): Microbiologist and single mother to Debi. She firmly embraces standard procedure in her work, which causes friction with Blackwood and his chaotic and eccentric work habits. * Debi McCullough (Rachel Blanchard) * Norton Drake (Philip Akin, season 1): A long- time friend of Harrison, he is a paraplegic computer genius who is granted mobility via a voice-activated wheelchair named Gertrude. He is often portrayed as being cool and laid back with a good sense of humor. In earlier episodes he had a pseudo-Caribbean accent; this was later dropped. * Lt. Col. Paul Ironhorse (Richard Chaves, season 1): Military man. He is rather conservative and often clashes with the other members of the team, especially Blackwood who is his political and philosophical opposite. * John Kincaid (Adrian Paul, season 2): Human resistance member * Malzor (Denis Forest, season 2): Alien commander * Mana (Catherine Disher, season 2): Alien scientist = Notable guest stars = The first season featured some recognisable actors in the series. Aside from getting Ann Robinson to reprise her role as Sylvia van Buren from the film, the series also obtained John Colicos (from Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek) as rogue alien Quinn who, while only appearing twice, was no doubt intended to play an integral part of the series as it went on (the character's power-hungry nature and middleman status between two worlds is noticeably reminiscent of Colicos‚Äô role as Count Baltar). The list of notable guests begins in the show's very start with John Vernon appearing in the first two episodes as General Wilson. Other actors throughout the series: Patrick Macnee, Greg Morris, Jeff Corey, John Ireland, Colm Feore, and James Hong. The series was also the early working ground for future stars (including Chris Potter who made his acting debut in episode two). Aside from exclusive season two star Adrian Paul (of Highlander fame), the second season also featured the first onscreen appearance of Mia Kirshner. The second season also gave more screentime to Rachel Blanchard, who only had minor play in the first season.  Episodes  =Season 1 (1988‚Äì89)= =Season 2 (1989‚Äì90)=  Releases  = Novelization = A novelization of the pilot episode was written by J. M. Dillard. While following the same narrative structure of the episode, the book contains characters from the 1953 film and scenes not included in the final cut of the pilot; it also explores more deeply the aliens' political motivations, and emphasizes denial instead of the \\"selective amnesia\\" aspect of the plot. = Home media = On November 1, 2005, Paramount Home Media Distribution released season 1 on DVD in Region 1. The set's release coincided with the DVD re-release of the 1953 film from which the show was spawned (the updated version from Steven Spielberg being released on DVD later the same month). A common criticism of the DVDs has been the poor image quality; fans in particular also point out the omission of the alien hand animation from the opening credits that had been inexplicably removed from every episode. The set contains no special features. It does, however, allow the viewer to jump to a chapter, which are divided by act, including the opening and closing credits, but are not available via any menu. It also includes closed captioning, but these may not be entirely reliable as there are several clear errors - for example, it is inconsistent in how it spells the name of the aliens' homeworld, neither of which is the canonical spelling. By contrast, however, in a few episodes, the captioning refers to the Advocates by the name of their original host bodies from the pilot episode (i.e. Chambers, Urick, and Einhorn), even in the absence of the original actors. The second and final season was released on October 26, 2010, nearly five years after the release of the first season. In Region 2, Revelation Films has released both seasons on DVD in the UK. Season 1 was released on April 30, 2012 and Season 2 was released on August 30, 2012. On February 6, 2018, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution released seasons 1 and 2 as a single package entitled War of the Worlds: The Complete Series on DVD.

The film stars Lindsey Haun, Jack Huston, and Max Kasch. The plot follows a group of American students and their English guide who are stalked by a serial killer while out in the woods looking for psilocybin mushrooms.  Plot  American student Tara and her college friends visit Ireland to meet with local resident and friend Jake, and go camping in woodlands surrounding a long-disused children's home. While collecting psilocybin mushrooms for later consumption, Tara eats a death bell mushroom (Galerina) and suffers a seizure after which she experiences dream-like trances in which she begins having premonitions of future events. Around the evening camp fire, with Tara resting in her tent, Jake tells a ghost story of the empty children's home nearby, and of a violent sadistic monk who survived an assault by one of his charges, as revenge for killing his twin brother. Overhearing this causes Tara to have premonitions of the murders of her friends. After a deathly row with his girlfriend and the others, aggressive jock Bluto drinks some of the hallucinogenic tea (supposedly for all to share in the morning) and experiences a trip which culminates in his murder, seemingly at the hands of the rogue monk from the children's home. The following morning, unconcerned by Bluto's disappearance ‚Äì the others consume the mushroom tea, only to become separated from one another in the woods while under its effects. The three women, arguing and squabbling, get lost until they themselves are split, and Holly and Lisa are violently murdered ‚Äì in accordance with Tara's continuing visions ‚Äì after an encounter with local woodsmen Ernie and Bernie. Jake and Troy find Tara on the bank of a river, and tell her to meet them in the abandoned home to summon help. Upon investigating the property, Troy is apparently killed by the monk, and Jake escapes by jumping from a high window, breaking his leg as he lands. Tara finds him and the two flee the haunted scene. Then, while resting his leg, he is murdered. Tara awakes as a Garda helicopter hovers over the camp, and is dispatched into an ambulance as the sole survivor. As her mobile phone rings, she experiences a rapid flashback and realizes that the death bell mushroom caused her to murder all of her friends. She asks the paramedic for help. Everything becomes quiet until we see her bloody hands holding a pair of bloody scissors which suggests that she has killed the paramedic. The film ends with Tara running in the woods.

As a result, the CTTIC speaks for about 3,500 language professionals, some 2,500 of whom are certified. The CTTIC is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT). History The Council was originally incorporated in 1956 as the Society of Translators and Interpreters of Canada (STIC), or, in French, the Soci√©t√© des traducteurs et interpr√®tes du Canada (STIC). It changed its name, becoming CTIC (the Canadian Translators and Interpreters Council, or, in French the Conseil des traducteurs et interpr√®tes du Canada) in 1970. The Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario (ATIO) and the Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interpr√®tes agr√©√©s du Qu√©bec (OTTIAQ) (known, at that time, as the Soci√©t√© des traducteurs du Qu√©bec (STQ)), are the founding members of the Council. On June 11, 2012, OTTIAQ withdrew from CTTIC.

More than 100 professional associations are affiliated, representing over 80,000 translators in 55 countries. The goal of the Federation is to promote professionalism in the disciplines which it represents. It seeks constantly to improve conditions for the profession in all countries and to uphold translators' rights and freedom of expression. The FIT maintains operational relations with UNESCO and promotes International Translation Day. Objectives The objectives of the FIT are: *to link and bring together existing associations of translators, interpreters and terminologists; *to encourage and facilitate the formation of such associations in countries where they do not already exist; *to provide member associations with information about conditions of work, technological tools, initial and ongoing training, and all questions useful to the profession; *to develop and maintain, among all member associations, good relations that serve the interests of translators; *to uphold the moral and material rights of translators throughout the world;. *to promote the recognition of the professions of translator, interpreter and terminologist, enhance the status of translators in society, and promote translation as a science and an art. Committees The Federation, through its committees, undertakes to meet the various expectations of its members by addressing matters of training, conditions of work, the various aspects of the profession, and the categories of translators, interpreters and terminologists. To take part in the work of one of the twelve committees is an individual contribution to the profession as a whole. Governing bodies The FIT's supreme body is the statutory congress, which is held every three years. It brings together delegations from the member associations, and it elects the Council, which in turn elects its Executive Committee and directs the FIT until the next world congress. The governing bodies are supported by different committees, which report to the Council annually about their activities, and to the congress. The statutory congress is followed by an open congress, which is an outstanding platform for exchanges among all professionals in the translation sector. Publications and public relations The FIT is a worldwide organisation, composed of the national translation organisations from over 60 countries. It represents over 100,000 translators worldwide. The journal BABEL and the bulletin Translatio are the Federation's quarterly publications, and are widely disseminated. Babel is a scholarly publication presenting articles from all round the world. Translatio is the Federation's information organ, telling members about its activities and those of its committees and member associations. The proceedings of each congress are also published, and serve as a further source of valuable information to those interested in the many facets of the translation profession. In addition, FIT participates, between its own world congresses, in the organisation of seminars, colloquia and round table discussions on various aspects of the profession. Secretariat FIT has had a part-time secretariat (20 hours a week) since 1999. The secretariat is the anchor for FIT's membership administration and activities. The secretariat works closely with the EC and Council and relevant task forces. The FIT Secretariat has been located in Switzerland since October 2010, after 11 years in Canada, and is run by FIT's Executive Director, Jeannette √òrsted.

This may be the oldest henge site in the British Isles. Various traditions associated with the stones survived into the modern era and they form part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site. They are looked after by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. Layout and location The surviving stones are sited on a promontory at the south bank of the stream that joins the southern ends of the sea loch Loch of Stenness and the freshwater Loch of Harray. The name, which is pronounced stane-is in Orcadian dialect, comes from Old Norse meaning stone headland. The stream is now bridged, but at one time was crossed by a stepping stone causeway, and the Ring of Brodgar lies about away to the north-west, across the stream and near the tip of the isthmus formed between the two lochs. Maeshowe chambered cairn is about to the east of the Standing Stones of Stenness and several other Neolithic monuments also lie in the vicinity, suggesting that this area had particular importance. The Stenness Watch Stone stands outside the circle, next to the modern bridge leading to the Ring of Brodgar Although the site today lacks the encircling ditch and bank, excavation has shown that this used to be a henge monument, possibly the oldest in the British Isles. The stones are thin slabs, approximately thick with sharply angled tops. Four, up to about high, were originally elements of a stone circle of up to 12 stones, laid out in an ellipse about diameter on a levelled platform of diameter surrounded by a ditch. The ditch is cut into rock by as much as and is wide, surrounded by an earth bank, with a single entrance causeway on the north side. The entrance faces towards the Neolithic Barnhouse Settlement which has been found adjacent to the Loch of Harray. The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north-west and is high. Once there were at least two stones there, as in the 1930s the stump of a second stone was found. Other smaller stones include a square stone setting in the centre of the circle platform where cremated bone, charcoal and pottery were found. This is referred to as a \\"hearth\\", similar to the one found at Barnhouse. Animal bones were found in the ditch. The pottery links the monument to Skara Brae and Maeshowe. Based on radiocarbon dating, it is thought that work on the site had begun by 3100 BC. Traditions and history Even in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals, by then relating to Norse gods. It was visited by Walter Scott in 1814. Other antiquarians documented the stones and recorded local traditions and beliefs about them. One stone, known as the \\"Odin Stone\\" which stood in the field to the north of the henge, was pierced with a circular hole, and was used by local couples for plighting engagements by holding hands through the gap. It was also associated with other ceremonies and believed to have magical power.Orkneyjar ‚Äì The Odin Stone There was a reported tradition of making all kinds of oaths or promises with one's hand in the Odin Stone; this was known as taking the \\"Vow of Odin\\". In December 1814 Captain W. Mackay, a recent immigrant to Orkney who owned farmland in the vicinity of the stones, decided to remove them on the grounds that local people were trespassing and disturbing his land by using the stones in rituals. He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone. This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying one other stone and toppling another. The toppled stone was re-erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle.Orkneyjar - The Standing Stones of Stenness In the 1970s, a dolmen structure was toppled, since there were doubts as to its authenticity. The two upright stones remain in place. A picture of the Stones of Stenness features on the cover of Van Morrison's album The Philosopher's Stone, and the Odin stone is depicted on Julian Cope's album Discover Odin. The stones are also the setting for the Loreena McKennitt song \\"Standing Stones\\" from her album Parallel Dreams, concerning a pair of star- crossed lovers who meet at the Odin stone, only for the man to meet a tragic fate. World Heritage status The Heart of Neolithic Orkney was inscribed as a World Heritage site in December 1999. In addition to the Standing Stones of Stenness, the site includes Maeshowe, Skara Brae, the Ring of Brodgar and other nearby sites. It is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, whose 'Statement of Significance' for the site begins: > The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the > triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were > approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt > (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first > cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than > the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a > remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol > of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of > civilisation...Stenness is a unique and early expression of the ritual > customs of the people who buried their dead in tombs like Maes Howe and > lived in settlements like Skara Brae.\\"The Heart of Neolithic Orkney\\". > Historic Scotland.

It offers video game news, coverage of industry events, interviews with gaming figures, editorial content, and product reviews. History The magazine was founded in 1988 as U.S. National Video Game Team's Electronic Gaming Monthly under Sendai Publications. In 1994, EGM spun off EGM¬≤, which focused on expanded cheats and tricks (i.e., with maps and guides). It eventually became Expert Gamer and finally the defunct GameNOW. After 83 issues (up to June 1996), EGM switched publishers from Sendai Publishing to Ziff Davis.EGM #83, June 1996; EGM #84, July 1996 Until January 2009, EGM only covered gaming on console hardware and software. In 2002, the magazine's subscription increased by more than 25 percent. The magazine was discontinued by Ziff Davis in January 2009, following the sale of 1UP.com to UGO Networks. The magazine's February 2009 issue was already completed, but was not published. In May 2009, EGM founder Steve Harris purchased the magazine and its assets from Ziff Davis. The magazine was relaunched in April 2010 by Harris' new company EGM Media, LLC, widening its coverage to the PC and mobile gaming markets. Notable contributors to Electronic Gaming Monthly have included Martin Alessi, Ken Williams (as Sushi-X), \\"Trickman\\" Terry Minnich, Andrew \\"Cyber-Boy\\" Baran, Danyon Carpenter, Marc Camron (later Director of Operations), Mark \\"Candyman\\" LeFebvre, Todd Rogers, Mike Weigand a.k.a. Major Mike (now Managing Editor at GamePro Magazine), Al Manuel, Howard Grossman, Arcade Editor Mark \\"Mo\\" Hain, Mike \\"Virus\\" Vallas, Jason Streetz, Ken Badziak, Scott Augustyn, Chris Johnston, Che Chou, Dave Ruchala, Crispin Boyer, Greg Sewart, Jeanne Trais, Jennifer Tsao, artist Jeremy Norm Scott, Game Scholar Leonard Herman, Shawn \\"Shawnimal\\" Smith, West Coast Editor Kelly Rickards, Kraig Kujawa, Dean Hager, Jeremy Parish, and Mark Macdonald (who later went on to become director of Gamevideos.com before leaving Ziff-Davis). Writers who also served stints as editor-in chief include Ed Semrad, Joe Funk, John Davison, James Mielke, artist Jeremy \\"Norm\\" Scott, Dan \\"Shoe\\" Hsu, and Seanbaby. In addition, writers of EGM's various sister publications ‚Äì including GameNow, Computer Gaming World/Games for Windows: The Official Magazine, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine ‚Äì would regularly contribute to EGM, and vice versa. The magazine is known for making April Fools jokes. Its April 1992 issue was the source of the Sheng Long hoax in Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. = Web-only relaunch (2019‚Äìpresent) = In March 2019, EGM announced that it was going to relaunch \\"later this year\\" into an outfit that will have \\"a new look and a focus on long-form features, original reporting, and intelligent critique.\\" It enters under the backronym \\"Enjoy Games More\\". In a letter in April 2020, editor Josh Harmon announced that the site would no longer publish long-form articles, prompting speculation that the publication had shut down. Harmon edited the announcement shortly afterwards to confirm that the site would continue \\"some form of daily news coverage\\".  Magazine structure  Second revision of the EGM logo The magazine includes the following sections: * Insert Coin ** Letter from the editor ‚Äì the editorial ** Login ‚Äì Letters from readers and replies by the magazine * Press Start ** This section contains a general article about video gaming ** EGM RoundTable ‚Äì discussions around video games ** The Buzz ‚Äì industry rumors ** The EGM Hot List ‚Äì background information about a critically acclaimed game * Features ‚Äì feature articles ** The EGM Interview ‚Äì interview with a person from the gaming industry ** Cover Story ‚Äì preview of the game featured on the magazine cover ** Next Wave ‚Äì previews of upcoming games ** Launch Point ‚Äì short previews of upcoming games * Review Crew ‚Äì review section ** Review Recap ‚Äì recapitulation of the review scores from the preceding issue * Game Over ‚Äì Commentary articles on video gaming related topics = The Review Crew= EGM's current review scale is based on a letter grade system in which each game receives a grade based on its perceived quality. Games are reviewed by one member (originally a team of four until the year 2000, then a team of three, and finally knocked down to one in 2008), except for \\"the big games\\", which were reviewed by one of a pool of editors known as \\"The Review Crew.\\" They each assign a grade to the game and write a few paragraphs about their opinion of the game. The magazine makes a strong stance that a grade of C is average. Towards the top of the scale, awards are given to games that average a B- or higher from the three individual grade: \\"Silver\\" awards for games averaging a grade of B- to B+; \\"Gold\\" awards for games averaging a grade of A- or A; and \\"Platinum\\" awards for games with three A+ grades. The current letter grade system replaced a long-standing 0‚Äì10 scale in the April 2008 issue. In that system, Silver went to a game with an average rating from 8 to 9, Gold to a game reviewed at 9 to 10, and Platinum to a game that received nothing but 10 ratings. Until 1998, as a matter of editorial policy, the reviewers rarely gave scores of 10, and never gave a Platinum Award. That policy changed when the reviewers gave Metal Gear Solid four 10 ratings in 1998, with an editorial announcing the shift. In addition, they gave the game (or multiple games in the event of a tie, as with Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for Xbox and NCAA Football 2006) with the highest average score for that issue a \\"Game of the Month\\" award. If a \\"Game of the Month\\" title receives a port to another console, that version is disqualified from that month's award, such as with Resident Evil 4, which won the award for the Nintendo GameCube version and subsequently received the highest scores for the PlayStation 2 port months later, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, which won the Platinum award for two separate versions of the game. In 2002, EGM began giving games that earned unanimously bad scores a \\"Shame of the Month\\" award. As there is not always such a game in each issue, this award is only given out when a game qualifies. Originally, a team of four editors reviewed all the games. This process was eventually dropped in favor of a system that added more reviewers to the staff so that no one person reviewed all the games for the month. Though the scores ranged from 0‚Äì10 on the previous numerical scale, the score of zero was almost never utilized, with exceptions being Mortal Kombat Advance, The Guy Game, and Ping Pals. International expansion EGM en Espa√±ol was released in Mexico in November 2002. It was published by Editorial Televisa and is edited by a different staff. Sometimes the content was more focused to the Latin American gaming crowd (e.g. soccer games were paid more attention than NASCAR or American football games), as well as the humor and other features. Sometimes it featured jokes among the Mexican community and sometimes supported the production with a poster. Adri√°n Carbajal ‚ÄúCarqui‚Äù, with a long experience in Mexican gaming magazines (prior to EGM en Espa√±ol, he worked in now competitor publications Club Nintendo and Atomix), was the editor-in-chief through the entire run. There was a weekly official podcast called \\"Playtime!\\" hosted by most of the editorial staff. EGM en Espa√±ol has been cancelled as of December 2008 due to Ziff Davis Media's economical problems. EGM was also published in Brazil as EGM Brasil by Conrad Editora since April 2002. Since the last quarter of 2005, EGM Brasil was being published by Futuro Comunica√ß√£o. With the suspension of U.S. sales of the EGM, the Brazilian EGM was rebranded to EGW (Entertainment + Game World). In 2006 three other editions of EGM were published around the world. EGM Thailand is published by Future Gamer Company Ltd., EGM Singapore is published by MediaCorp Publishing and EGM Turkey is published by Merkez Dergi. Internet presence In 1995, EGMs first online website was nuke.com. It merged with GameSpot in 1996 after Ziff-Davis purchased Sendai Media Group. In 2003, EGM created a new website, 1UP.com, after GameSpot was sold to CNET Networks. Since the magazine's relaunch in 2010, the affiliated website has been egmnow.com EGM Live* was a podcast hosted every Monday by the editors of EGM on 1UP.com. The podcast was available for download at 1UP.com or the iTunes music store. Much like other podcasts on the 1UP network, the program could include discussion of various message board topics, an analysis of new games being reviewed, a mailbag section, a deeper look into the most recent issue of the magazine, or interviews with special guests such as Marcus Henderson and Ted Lange from Harmonix and Cliff Bleszinski from Epic Games. The \\"*\\" at the end of the name was to denote that the podcast was not actually \\"live\\" in the general media sense. It was later replaced by 1UPFM, another weekly Monday podcast where 1UP crew members Nick Suttner and Phil Kollar hosted the show, along with other 1UP members. EGM2 EGM2 (stylized as EGM2) was a video game magazine published by Sendai Publishing from July 1994 to July 1998 as a spin-off of Electronic Gaming Monthly. Unlike EGM, however, EGM2 lacked a reviews section and had a greater emphasis on import games. Starting in August 1998, EGM2 became Expert Gamer (often abbreviated as XG). Although with a different name, XG continued EGM2s numbering system. XG lasted for 39 issues until October 2001 (with the last issue being XG #88). =History= The first issue of EGM2 was in July 1994. The magazine lasted 49 issues with the last issue under the original name coming out in July 1998. The change of name prompted a cleaner looking redesign although the content of the magazine would remain the same. Reception In a 2014 retrospective, Polygon said: \\"For two decades, EGM maintained a focal position in the games media landscape. In the time before the internet, the periodical was a vital conduit for American readers interested in the hobby.\\" References  External links  *EGM Now ‚Äì official site of the revised magazine. * EGM History Page on VideoGameObsesion ‚Äì Contains information and covers for both runs of EGM. *Archived EGM magazines at the Internet Archive *Electronic Gaming Monthly PDF scans on Retro CDN Category:1988 establishments in Illinois Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Video game magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1988 Category:Magazines published in Illinois ","title":"Electronic Gaming Monthly"},{"id":"893482","text":"The Canadian Association of Sign Language Interpreters (CASLI), formally the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada (AVLIC), is a professional association that represents interpreters in Canada whose working languages are English, American Sign Language (ASL), French and Langue des signes qu√©b√©coise (LSQ).

However, the MOB is not a traditional marching band, but rather a scatter band; members do not march, and some members play non-standard instruments (or no instrument at all). For example, in recent seasons these instruments included violins, violas, a cello, electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano, and even a harp. Extras known as Show Assistants are also a perennial inclusion in the MOB; these students play no instruments besides the kazoo (or an occasional didgeridoo), but are responsible for constructing and employing props in the halftime shows and acting out any mime or gag bits during performances. Rather than wear traditional marching band attire, The MOB instead dons pinstriped three-piece suits, ties, sunglasses, fedoras, and (in the case of Show Assistants) tommy gun props. (This attire is an obvious nod to the band's acronym, though in practice falls somewhere between the style of Capone-era mobsters and The Blues Brothers.) The group is known for satirical football halftime shows which, as MOB director Chuck Throckmorton says, poke fun at rival universities' sacred cows. The MOB plays primarily classic rock-and-roll pieces, though blues, swing, funk, classical, and other styles are featured on various occasions. Its signature song is a rendition of \\"Louie Louie\\", a hit from the 1960s originally performed by the Kingsmen. Other staples include \\"Bonnet\\" (adapted from \\"Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet\\", 1909), the Rice University Fight Song (played after every Rice touchdown at football games), and \\"Turning it Loose\\" (a variation of the Otis Redding and Steve Cropper blues hit \\"I Can't Turn You Loose\\" similar to the one used as The Blues Brothers' theme song). History =Formation and early years= Formed in 1916, the Rice Owl Band consisted of twelve enterprising students from all colleges of the university. In 1922, under the leadership of Mr. Lee Chatham, the band grew from thirty-five to about fifty pieces. Rehearsals were held in Autry House, across Main Street from campus. During this period, however, there were few high school bands, so civic and municipal bands and private teachers supplied the main body of membership. Mr. Kit Reid stepped up as director following Mr. Chatham's retirement in 1938. During the period of World War II, manpower shortages that plagued other areas also hit the band, prompting Hugh Saye and Dick Kincheloe to form a band under the V-12 program consisting of Navy cadets supplemented by civilians from the student body. After the war, the band was reorganized, and the first women, four majorettes, joined the previously all-male organization. Neel Cotten completed the academic year as director following Mr. Reid's retirement in 1950. In 1951, Holmes McNeely became director and instituted a building program of both equipment and personnel. Mr. McNeely was the first to offer a number of band scholarships to students involved with the Rice Owl Band. At this time, women musicians were added to the general Rice band for the first time. Upon the retirement of Mr. McNeely in 1967, Mr. Bert Roth took charge of band activities. In the fall of 1968, he gave a work scholarship to every qualified member of the Rice Owl Band in recognition of their participation. The Rice Owl Band broke with tradition in 1970 and began to introduce timely and sometimes controversial topics into their halftime activities. With their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks, the band parodied politics, life at Rice, and other members of the Southwest Conference. During this period the band also gradually stopped marching and began the \\"scattering\\" techniques for which it is now known. This type of entertainment proved popular with band members, since the rehearsal time necessary to learn a show was greatly reduced, thus becoming more manageable in conjunction with a full academic course load. These shows also become popular with Rice's proudly irreverent student body. =Modernization= Dr. Ken Dye took over the director's job in 1980. By emphasizing musical quality and contemporary show design, the band (now called the Marching Owl Band, or the MOB) could target and entertain a larger audience. In 1982, Dye updated the MOB's uniforms, playing to the \\"mob\\" angle of the band's acronym and introducing the gray felt fedoras that have ever since been the band's trademark. Dr. Dye's tenure at Rice saw MOBsters perform at the Opening Ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics, the 1985 Presidential Inauguration, the 1986 Statue of Liberty Celebration and U.S. Olympic Festival, as well as the 1993 Carnivale in Nice, France. Dr. Dye believed that travel was an important part of any major college band. During his time as MOB director, the band accompanied the football team to places as far afield as Tulane, Notre Dame, and the campuses of all three military service academies. However, even with all of these notable accomplishments during his term at the helm, Dr. Dye's greatest legacy continues to be the library of musical arrangements that he has left to the band. A prolific arranger, during his time at Rice Dye arranged literally hundreds of tunes for the MOB to perform (as well as many that have been published and used by other schools). Among the MOB repertoire are first-class arrangements of many rock, jazz, and blues standards, from China Grove to Proud Mary, Hawai‚Äôi 5-0 to Mortal Kombat, Rock Lobster to Vehicle. =Disaster and rebirth= In the spring of 1995, a fire in the Rice Memorial Center gutted much of the MOB band hall, as well as campus hang-out Willy's Pub and other parts of the RMC. Devastated, members of the band wondered how the MOB could possibly recover. However, a move out of the aging band hall had already been planned, and this move was merely accelerated. Still, the MOB was forced to rebuild, working from a new band hall and purchasing new instruments, new uniforms, new equipment, new computers, and new office supplies all in time for the fall 1995 football season. On St. Patrick's Day, 1997, the MOB released a CD called MOB Reborn, featuring 25 of the band's favorite and most popular numbers. =Turmoil and succession= In 1996, the Southwest Conference disbanded. Rice, Southern Methodist University, and Texas Christian University joined the Western Athletic Conference, while traditional SWC opponents such as the University of Texas, Texas A&M; University, Baylor University, and Texas Tech University went to the Big 12. The resulting WAC swelled to an arguably unwieldy size, including schools from 16 states across 6 time zones. While this period saw the MOB travel to new locations such as California, it was also a significant adjustment for students and fans. In 1997, Dr. Dye left Rice to rebuild the band program at the school now known as University of West Georgia, a position he held for only one year before moving on to a directorship at the University of Notre Dame in the fall of 1998. Mr. Sean Williams was hired in the summer of 1997 to serve the MOB and the Rice Band Department as interim director until a permanent replacement for Dye could be found. That replacement was Dr. Robert Cesario, who came from Tulsa, Oklahoma and took up the baton in the fall of 1998. After four years, Dr. Cesario resigned as Director of Rice Bands in the summer of 2002, and was succeeded by Mr. Charles Throckmorton. In 2005, Rice joined Conference USA (C-USA), restoring cross-town rival, the University of Houston, to the status of conference opponent for the first time since the breakup of the Southwest Conference. The two are no longer conference rivals following UH's 2013 departure for the American Athletic Conference. Despite considerable membership turnover in C-USA in the early 2010s, the league still brings Rice into contact with opponents from Texas to the Eastern Seaboard. Satire and controversy The MOB \\"pokes fun at itself and the world\\", from political figures to Rice administration personnel to visiting teams. A few shows in particular have provoked more than the usual uproar: * In 1973 the Texas A&M; Aggies took exception to a MOB performance which featured such typical MOB irreverence as Nazi-style goosestepping, turning the Aggie War Hymn into \\"Little Wooden Soldier March\\", and forming a fire hydrant while playing \\"Oh Where, Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone?\\" in reference to the Aggie mascot Reveille. After the game, the Aggies formed an angry mob outside Rice's own stadium, trapping the Owl band inside for hours until police dispersed some of the crowd and allowed the band to exit, transported by food service trucks. In the years after this now-infamous show, attention has been focused on the shot at Reveille, and that this was an attempt to mock the mascot shortly after her death; in fact it was no more than \\"poorly-aimed scatological humor\\", the mascot in question having been alive and present at the game. * In 2007, the MOB used their halftime performance to poke fun at the legal woes facing some members of the Texas Longhorns. The band, wearing dark sunglasses, opened with the theme from Dragnet. Three members dressed as Longhorn football players ran around the field being chased by other band members carrying cardboard police cars. The Rice announcer narrated: \\"In the two years since the MOB last visited Austin, your team's demeanor ‚Äî and misdemeanor ‚Äî has changed. Buy a program at today's game. It includes Mack Brown's wrist-slap Top 10 and a photo guide to the next episode of America's Most Wanted.\\" * In 2011, the season opener against Texas in Austin saw the MOB form $EC during halftime as a commentary regarding Texas A&M; leaving the Big 12 Conference and moving to the Southeastern Conference. This happened days before A&M; announced its withdrawal from the Big 12 Conference and upcoming move to the SEC. * In 2016, during the halftime performance of Rice's game against Baylor, the band formed the roman numerals \\"IX\\" in reference to Title IX, the federal law at the center of an offseason sexual assault scandal at Baylor. They also made the shape of a star while playing the song \\"Hit The Road Jack,\\" alluding to the firing of former Baylor president Ken Starr in the wake of the scandal.http://www.chron.com/sports/rice/article/Rice-band-mocks- Baylor-for-Title-IX-lawsuits-9228565.php References External links * Category:Rice Owls Category:Conference USA marching bands Category:Scramble bands Category:Musical groups established in 1916 Category:1916 establishments in Texas ","title":"Marching Owl Band"},{"id":"893493","text":"Mush, MUSH, or Mushing may refer to :  Common meanings  * Mush (cornmeal), a kind of corn pudding or porridge * Mushing, a sport or transport method powered by dogs or a command to a dog team * Psilocybin mushroom, a mushroom used as a recreational drug  Places and jurisdictions  * Mu≈ü Province, in eastern Anatolia (Asian Turkey) ** Mu≈ü, a town and the capital of Mu≈ü Province, transliterated as \\"Mush\\", former bishric and present Armenian Catholic titular see  People  = Nickname = * Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer, born 1970), Pakistani former cricketer * Mushaga Bakenga (born 1992), Norwegian footballer of Congolese descent * Mush Crawford (1898-1966), American National Football League player * R.

It is dedicated to the god Shiva and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, where the Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar, Maharashtra are kept. The origin of the sacred Godavari river is near Trimbak. Kusavarta kunda (sacred pond) in the temple premises, built by Shrimant Sardar Raosaheb Parnerkar who was the Fadnavis of Indore State, is the source of the Godavari River, the longest river in peninsular India. A bust of Sardar Fadnavis and his wife can be seen on the edge of the kunda. The current temple was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao (Nanasaheb). Architecture The temple is located between three hills namely Brahmagiri, Nilagiri and Kalagiri. The temple has three lingams (an iconic form of Shiv) representing Shiv, Vishnu and Brahma. The temple tank is called Amritavarshini, which measured bu . There are three other bodies of water, namely, Bilvatheertha, Viswananthirtha and Mukundathirtha. There are images of various deities, namely, Gangadevi, Jaleswara, Rameswara, Gautameswara, Kedarnatha, Rama, Krishna, Parasurama and Lakshmi Narayana. The temple has also several monasteries and samadhis of saints. Jyotirlinga Triambakeshwar Temple, Nashi As per the Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.R. 2003, pp. 92-95 To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The Jyotirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.Eck 1999, p. 107See: Gwynne 2008, Section on Char Dham Originally there were believed to be 64 jyotirlingas while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve jyotirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiv.Lochtefeld 2002, pp. 324-325 At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiv.Harding 1998, pp. 158-158Vivekananda Vol. 4 The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Trimbakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Nageshwar Temple at Dwaraka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.Chaturvedi 2006, pp. 58-72 Lord Shiva showed himself as a Jyotirlinga on the night of the Aridra Nakshatra. It is believed that a person can see the Jyotirlingas as columns of fire piercing through the earth as he reaches a higher level of spiritual attainment. Each Jyotirlinga site takes the name of the presiding deity. Basically, the Jyotirlinga signifies the infinite nature of Lord Shiv. At the highest level, Shiva is regarded as formless, limitless, transcendent and unchanging absolute Brahman and the primal Atman (soul, self) of the universe. =Genealogy registers= Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar are the genealogy registers of pilgrims maintained here by pandas.Tracing your Asian roots www.overseasindian.in.Hindu Pilgrimage Marriage Records www.movinghere.org.uk.10 Places Across The World That Help You Trace Your Ancestors, India Times, 29 Jan 2016. Temple Legend Close up of the top of Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple Trimbakeshwar is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Rudra. Due to the excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. The Lingas are covered by a jeweled crown which is placed over the Gold Mask of Tridev (Brahma Vishnu Mahesh). The crown is said to be from the age of Pandavs and consists of diamonds, emeralds, and many precious stones. The crown is displayed every Monday from 4-5 pm (Shiv). All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The entire black stone temple is known for its appealing architecture and sculpture and is at the foothills of a mountain called Brahmagiri. Three sources of the Godavari originate from the Brahmagiri mountain. Story related to the Godavari river Entrance to the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple. Brahmadev worshipped God Trivikram when he came to Satya Loka (on earth) with the same holy water of the Ganges, to get the river Ganges held up by God Shankar on his head, to flow. There was a famine of 24 years and people were affected by the pangs of hunger. However, Varun - the God of Rains, pleased with Sage Gautama arranged rains every day in Gautama's Ashram (dwelling place) which was in Trimbakeshwar. Gautama used to sow rice in the surrounding fields of his Ashram in the morning, reap the crop in the afternoon and with it fed a large group of Hrishis, who took shelter in his Ashram on account of the famine. The blessings of the group of rishis increased the merit (Punya) of Gautama. Lord Indra's position became shaky because of his increased merit. So Indra ordered clouds to rain all over Trimbakeshwar, so that the famine will be over and rishis will go back and the increasing merits of Gautama will be weakened. Although the famine was over, Gautama urged the Rishis to stay back and kept on feeding them and gaining merit. Once he saw a cow grazing in the paddy field and he drove her away by throwing Darbha (sharp, pointed grass). The slender cow died by this. It was Jaya - Parvati's friend, who had taken the form of a cow. This news upset the Rishis and they refused to luncheon at his Ashram. Gautama requested Rishis to show a way out of this sin. He was advised to approach Lord Shiva and request him to release the Ganges and a bath in the Ganges would set him free of his sins. Gautama then practiced penance by going to the peak of Brahmagiri for 1000 years. Lord Shankara was pleased by his worships and gave him the Ganges. Kusavarta, a place where river Godavari takes course. However, Ganges was not prepared to part with Lord Shiv, which irritated him. He made TandavNrutya (dance) on the peak of Brahmagiri and dashed his jata there. Frightened by this action, Ganges appeared on Brahmagiri. Later on, Ganges appeared in the Trimbak Tirtha. Gautama praised her but she off and on appeared on the mountain at various places and disappeared in anger. Gautama could not bathe in her waters. The Ganges then appeared in Gangadwar, Varaha-tirtha, Rama- Laxman tirtha, Ganga Sagar tirtha. Still, Gautama could not bathe in her waters. The Gautama surrounded the river with enchanted grass and put a vow to her. The flow stopped there and the tirtha thus came to be called Kushavarta. It is from this Kushavarta that the river Godavari flows up to the sea. The sin of killing a cow by Gautama was wiped off here. This place is famous for its many religious rituals (vidhis). Narayan Nagbali, Kalsarpa Shanti, Tripindi Vidhi are done here. Narayan Nagbali puja is performed at Trimbakeshwar only. This puja is performed in three days. This puja is performed on special dates. Some days are not suitable to perform this puja. This puja is performed for many reasons like to cure an illness, going through bad times, killing a Cobra (Nag), childless couples, financial crisis or you want to perform some religious puja to have everything. Trimbakeshwar town has a large number of Brahmin households and is also a centre for Vedic Gurukuls (kind of boarding school). It also has ashrams and Muths devoted to Ashtanga Yoga, the Hindu art of living. The existing temple was built out of basalt after it was commissioned by Peshwa Nanasaheb. It so happens that the Peshwa made a bet on whether the stone surrounding the Jyotirlinga, is hollow from the inside or not. The stone was proved to be hollow, and on losing the bet, the Peshwa built a marvelous temple out of it. The Shiva deity of the temple consisted of the world-famous Nassak Diamond. It was looted by the British in The Third Anglo-Maratha War and lies with one owner or the other ever since. The diamond presently lies with Edward J. Hand, a trucking firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut, USA The place is known for its scenic beauty in rainy/monsoon season and is surrounded by lush green hills untouched by pollution. Anjaneri mountain, the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, is 7 km from Trimbakeshwar. Shri Nilambika/Dattatreya/Matamba Temple Back view of Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple This temple is on top of the Neel mountain. All goddesses ('Matamba', 'Renuka', 'Mananmba') came here to see 'Parashuram' when he was performing penance (tapas). After his penance, he requested all goddesses to stay there and the temple was formed for these goddesses.

The pits usually comprise a pit lane which runs parallel to the start/finish straight and is connected at each end to the main track, and a row of garages (usually one per team) outside which the work is done. Pit stop work is carried out by anywhere from two to twenty mechanics (also called a \\"pit crew\\"), depending on the series regulations, while the driver often waits in the vehicle (except where a driver change is involved or in Motorbike racing). Location and terminology Pit road at 302x302px Depending on the circuit, the garage may be located on pit lane or in a separate area. In most series the order of the teams' pit boxes is assigned by points standings, race results, or previous qualifying results before the start of the race. In NASCAR and in INDYCAR's Indianapolis 500, typically pit assignments are made after qualifying, with the fastest qualifiers choosing their pit stall first. Most North American circuits feature a pit lane with a number of pit stalls (typically 30-50) and a pit wall that separates the pit lane from the infield, with the garages (if used) on a separate road in the infield. In races where there are different series racing together, each series has its own separate garage or are parked in their own area. Circuits in other parts of the world (used in Formula One) typically have the individual garages open directly onto the pit lane through the team's assigned pit box. In American English, it is common to drop the definite article and just refer to \\"pit road\\", whereas in British English one would always refer to \\"the pit lane\\". A further difference is that in British English, the term \\"pit box\\" is universally used, whereas in American English, one would say \\"pit stall\\". It is important to note that in NASCAR, a pit box is a tool (see below), though there is a definitive term used for them.  Purpose  Pit stop in 1964 at N√ºrburgring Where it is permitted, refuelling is often an important purpose of a pit stop. Carrying fuel slows down a vehicle and there is often a limit on the size of the fuel tank, so many races require multiple stops for fuel to complete the race distance in the minimum time. Changing tyres is also common to permit the use of softer tyres that wear faster but provide more grip, to use tyres suitable for wet conditions, or to use a range of tyres designated by the rules. Teams will aim for each of their vehicles to pit following a planned schedule, with the number of stops determined by many factors such as fuel capacity, tyre lifespan, and the trade-off between time lost in the pits versus time gained on the track due to the benefits of pit stops. Choosing the optimum pit strategy of how many stops to make and when to make them is crucial in having a successful race. It is also important for teams to take competitors' strategies into account when planning pit stops to avoid being held up behind a competitor where overtaking is difficult or risky. An unscheduled or extended stop, such as for a repair, can be very costly for a driver's chance of success, because while they are stopped for service, competitors remaining on the track are gaining time on them. For this reason, the pit crew often undergo intensive training to perform operations such as tyre changes as quickly as possible leading to pit stops, for example in Formula 1, where the car is only stationary for a few seconds for a regular pit stop.  General strategy  Pit lane at Pocono Raceway. In any racing series that permits scheduled pit stops, pit strategy becomes one of the most important features of the race; this is because a race car travelling at 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour) will travel approximately 150 feet (45 metres) per second. During a ten-second pit stop, a car's competitors will gain approximately one-quarter mile (400 metres) over the stopped car. However, the car that made the additional pit stop will run faster on the race track than cars that did not make the stop, both because it can carry a smaller amount (and thus lower weight) of fuel, and will also have less wear on its tyres, providing more traction and allowing higher speeds in the corners. In racing series where teams have their choice of different compound tyres, the lower tyre wear may be enough to allow the team to choose to use a tyre with a softer rubber compound that provides increased grip at the expense of faster wear; going longer between stops may even cause enough wear on the softer tyre to cause the tyres to fail. Because of this, race teams plan a pit strategy prior to the start of every race. This is a schedule for each car's planned pit stops during the race, and takes into account factors such as rate of fuel consumption, weight of fuel, cornering speed with each available tyre compound, rate of tyre wear, the effect of tyre wear on cornering speed, the length of pit road and the track's pit road speed limit, and even expected changes in weather and lighting conditions. The pit strategy does not just include a schedule of when pit stops will happen; it also includes what service and adjustments are scheduled for each pit stop, particularly in endurance racing, where scheduled changes of wear-limited parts such as brake pads may be planned for specific points during the race. The pit strategy is calculated carefully so that the amount of time to be \\"given away\\" to other competitors in pit stops is balanced out by the time gained while on the track, resulting, theoretically, in the shortest possible time to cover the scheduled distance. However, a team's pit strategy is not a fixed, immutable thing; it is subject to change during the race to take into account the unpredictable events that happen in every race. In road racing, for example, if the weather changes from dry to rain, teams will be forced to recalculate their pit strategy based on the unscheduled stop to change from dry-weather \\"slick\\" tyres to treaded wet-weather tyres. Safety car periods often see mass pit stops by many teams, hoping to take advantage of the slowed pace to reduce the ground lost to other teams while making pit stops; this forces teams that do so to immediately recalculate their pit strategy to optimize it for the remaining race distance after the stop. Even when a team chooses not to take advantage of the opportunity to stop during a full-course caution, it can still result in significant changes to pit strategy; under caution, the cars run at a reduced speed that results in greatly reduced tyre wear and fuel burn for a distance travelled. Depending on the circumstances, this may be enough for a team to gain more by choosing not to pit, hoping that the reduced fuel burn and tyre wear will allow them to make one pit stop fewer than the other teams, allowing them to gain distance and time on their opponents. At tracks noted for frequent full-course cautions, teams may even plan their entire race strategy around this, using a suspension and aerodynamic setup suited to short sprints instead of extended runs to gain positions in the short bursts of green-flag racing, and planning their pit strategy on the assumption that cautions will extend their fuel mileage and tyre wear enough to make fewer stops than would otherwise be needed to complete the race distance.  Services performed  Veteran pit crew member Jim Hersey holding pit 'lollipop' sign to signal the driver (267x267px During a scheduled pit stop, the team's pit crew services the vehicle as quickly as possible, completing a number of different services. The most common services performed are refuelling (where permitted) and changing tyres. Other services performed in routine pit stops include removing debris from radiator air intakes; cleaning the windscreen; and making adjustments to tyre pressure, suspension settings, and aerodynamic devices to optimize the vehicle's performance for the current conditions. In endurance racing, scheduled driver changes and brake pad replacements are also considered \\"routine\\" service when done as part of a scheduled pit stop. An unscheduled pit stop may see other services performed; because unscheduled stops are often due to damage or mechanical problems, they may include emergency repairs and replacement of parts. In some forms of racing, a team may be ordered to bring a vehicle into the pits as a penalty and either drive through the pit lane at the maximum permitted speed or remain stationary in their pit box for a specified period of time. During this time no services can be performed.  Formula One  Fernando Alonso's Ferrari pit crew carry out a pit stop at the 2012 Italian Grand Prix In Formula One, mid- race refuelling has been banned since 2010, and cars make pit stops with the primary purpose of changing tyres. Teams sometimes also make adjustments to the front and rear wings and perform minor repairs, most commonly replacing the nose and front wing assembly. A pit stop typically take 2 to 3 seconds to complete. Red Bull Racing holds the current world record for the fastest pit stop, with a 1.82 second stop performed at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix on Max Verstappen. Pit strategies generally call for between one and four scheduled stops, depending on the circuit. The drives between pit stops are commonly known as 'stints'. When the car is approximately one lap away from making its stop, the team's pit crew will set up fresh tyres and all needed pit equipment. Because of the overhead pneumatic rig, the team may have all pit mechanics in position prior to the car's arrival, with the exception of the rear jack man. Unlike almost all other forms of racing that feature routine pit stops, Formula One rules limit teams to a single pit crew for the mandatory two cars entered. Most other racing series that feature routine pit stops permit each car its own pit stall and crew. Therefore, teams must stagger their pit schedules so that only one of their two cars is in the pits at any given time, otherwise, one car must wait for the other car to finish services. However, with proper timing or in special conditions (for example, in the period immediately after the safety car being called out), it is possible for teams to pit both cars on the same lap without losing significant time - the 'double stack' strategy. This allows both of the team's drivers to race on equally fresh tyres, preventing either from having an advantage over the other, and helps the team hide the relative performance between two cars to other teams when only one car is in the pits. One strategy commonly used in Formula One pit stops is the 'undercut' involving two cars battling for track position. In this strategy, the car behind makes an earlier pitstop than the leading car; if successful, the car behind should be able to utilize the advantage of having fresh tyres to reduce the lead of the car they are attempting to overtake. If the gap between the two cars is reduced to less than the time lost in a pit stop, when the leading car pits, the leading car will exit the pits behind the car which pitted first. This strategy is especially effective when the leading car is stuck in traffic and/or if the car behind has clear track to push on, but can be negated if the car behind gets stuck in traffic after their early pitstop or is unable to drive fast enough to neutralize the advantage of the leading car. Similarly, there is the reverse (but less common) strategy of the overcut, where the leading car stays out on their older tyres longer and laps fast enough to maintain or even extend their advantage over the car behind - this strategy may be successful if the leading car's tyres are still in good shape when the car behind pits, sufficiently so that the leading car can push without being overly limited by tyre degradation, or if the car behind gets stuck in traffic, thus negating their ability to utilise their fresher tyres to their advantage. = Refuelling = Refuelling, now banned in F1 races, was permitted from the 1994 season to the 2009 season. During this period, a pit stop involved about twenty mechanics, with the aim of completing the stop as quickly as possible. Stops generally lasted for six to twelve seconds depending on how much fuel was put into the car. However, if there was a problem, such as a fuel pump failing or the engine stalling, or repairs having to be made, it could take much longer. Cars were fuelled at a rate of more than 12 litres per second. This was accomplished by a fairly complex closed system that pumped air out of the car's fuel tank as the fuel was being pumped in. Since fuel was a significant portion of a car's weight, teams varied the amount of fuel loaded into a car at any given stop (and prior to the race) and thus vary the number of pit stops. The most common strategies seen were one stop and two stop strategies; two stop strategies were employed to increase the car's speed/improve lap times to catch cars ahead, whereas one-stop strategies were used to gain time and track position to cars ahead with the advantage of one fewer pit stop. However, teams could and sometimes did opt for unorthodox pit strategies with multiple (3+) pit stops, as was employed by Ferrari and Michael Schumacher with four stops at the 2004 French Grand Prix which he eventually won. As refuelling was a potentially hazardous situation, the mechanics wore fire-resistant multi-layer suits and flame-resistant gloves, long underwear, balaclava, socks and shoes, which had to meet the guidelines set by FIA Standard 8856-2000. = F1 pit crew roles = 325x325px *Four wheel-gunners or tyre changers, one for each wheel/corner of the car, use a pneumatic wrench (\\"tyre gun\\") to remove the car's single locking lug nut from each tyre then reinstall it on the new tyre. *Eight tyre carriers are used (four each of wheel-off and wheel-on), two for each wheel/corner of the car, one to remove the old tyre from the car and one to put the new tyre in place. *Two stabilisers stabilise the car on each side at the middle of the car. *The front wing men, if necessary, adjust the front wing angle (to provide more/less downforce) and/or change the entire front wing (in case of damage sustained during the race). *The front and rear jack men use lever-type jacks to lift the car and permit the changing of tyres during the pit stop. **The job of the front jack man is generally considered the most hazardous of the entire pit crew, as it requires standing directly in front of the car as it enters its pit box. Mechanics in this role have been injured in the past when drivers have overshot/failed to brake in time for their pit box. **By contrast, due to the location of his duties directly behind the car, the rear jack man is the only team member not in his working position before the car enters its pit box. *The fire extinguisher man stands ready with a hand-held fire extinguisher to put out any fires that may occur during a stop, at least long enough for the pit crew and driver to evacuate. This job became standard following Jos Verstappen's 1994 pit fire. **Sometimes, more than one pit crew member may perform this role if a car comes in for an unscheduled stop with mechanical issues involving a fire/excessive heat (e.g. overheating brakes). Deprecated roles *The lollipop man held the team's pit sign (nicknamed the \\"lollipop\\" for its circular shape, hence the name of the role), helping the driver identify his pit box on the pit lane and holding it in position during the stop to remind the driver to keep his brakes on while tyres are being changed, to remember to put the car in first gear once the jacks are lowered, and finally to signal the driver to leave the pit box once the pit stop was complete by raising the sign. **Nowadays, this role is carried out by a traffic light system - drivers drive into their team pit by memory or by watching the crews out on pit lane and are signaled to leave the pit box by a series of lights suspended over the driver's head in the pit box controlled from the garage. *The refueling man managed the refueling system for the car, hooking it in place during the pit stop and disengaging it when refueling was complete. **With refueling having been banned in F1 from the 2010 season onwards, this role is no longer necessary as cars no longer refuel mid-race. *The starter man stood ready with a starter tool to restart the car should the driver stall his engine during the pit stop. **Nowadays, as modern F1 cars have anti-stall systems and can be started by the driver independently if needed using the car's battery, this role is no longer necessary, unless a situation calls for a complete engine reset.  Formula E  For its first four seasons, pit stops in Formula E served the primary purpose of changing cars - since FE cars did not yet contain the necessary electric charge to complete a full race, drivers needed to switch cars during the race. With the exception of repairing damaged tyres, no other mechanic services were allowed to be performed on the cars during the pit stop. Prior to the 2017‚Äì18 season, the rule and scoring system in Formula E allowed for some unusual pit stop strategies. Previously, drivers scored one point for setting the fastest lap in the race regardless of finishing position (or whether they finished the race at all); hence a driver with no chance at finishing in the point-scoring positions for whatever reason could switch cars, wait for the prematurely right moment to come out of the pits and set the fastest lap of the race. Notably, this was seen in the 2016 London ePrix, when championship contenders S√©bastien Buemi and Lucas di Grassi utilised this strategy after their first lap crash rendered them otherwise unable to score points; Buemi ended up with the fastest lap, winning the Formula E 2016 drivers‚Äô championship as a direct result. For the 2017‚Äì18 season, Formula E's rules were amended to restrict the additional point for fastest lap to drivers finishing in the top 10 only, rendering the aforementioned strategy obsolete. For its fifth season (2018‚Äì19) new cars were introduced which had batteries capable of completing the entire race distance. As such pit stops were no longer used during races other than in the event of repairing damages.Gitlin, Jonathan (14 December 2018) Formula E starts season 5 in Saudi Arabia with a faster electric race car Ars Technica. Retrieved 14 April 2019.  NASCAR  Brandon Jones' Joe Gibbs Racing pit crew of the NASCAR Xfinity Series execute a pit stop at Atlanta Motor Speedway in February 2019. Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s #8 Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo during a pit stop at Bristol Motor Speedway in 2006 Crew chiefs lead the pit crew during pit stops in addition to coaching the driver during the race. Pit crew members were once the mechanics on the racecar, but most teams feature individuals dedicated to pit stops only, and often former collegiate or professional athletes are used for pit stops. Former NFL player Tim Goad is regarded as the first former professional athlete involved in a pit crew, as a jackman. Nonetheless, some pit crew members work with the team in fabricating or designing the race cars during the week while training for their \\"pit job\\" on the weekends. Teams have built full training centers similar to that of professional athletes for their pit crews. There are a number of penalties that can be incurred on a pit stop. The driver must keep the car below the pit road speed from the pit entrance to the pit exit; the speed limit is typically 35-55 mph, depending on the size of the track. Teams can be penalized if the car is serviced outside of the designated pit stall, if the car drives over an air hose, or if any of the old tires are not on the pit wall side (usually left) of the vehicle's centerline before the car leaves. The most common penalty for a pit infraction is a \\"drive-through\\": the driver must enter the pits again, under the green flag, and maintain the pit speed limit for the entire length of pit road. If a car stalls, the pit crew may provide a push start, but the car cannot be pushed beyond three pit stalls ahead of its own, or beyond the pit exit light and steward at the end of pit road. Pit stops are timed from the moment the car stops in its pit stall, until service is finished and the car leaves the stall. A pit stop for four tires and fuel can last 12 to 16 seconds, and a stop for two tires and fuel may take 5 to 7 seconds. Late in a race, a team may only need a small amount of fuel to make it to finish; this is called a \\"splash and go\\" and may take as little as 2 to 3 seconds. These times depend upon any suspension adjustments performed and the quality of the crew. NASCAR Cup Series team pit strategies vary widely, depending on the track. Fuel is generally a more limiting factor than tire wear, and the phrase \\"fuel window\\" or \\"pit window\\" is used to indicate the maximum number of laps possible with a full load of fuel, assuming continuous green flag conditions and a small reserve. The window is used to calculate (or recalculate after a stop) the minimum number of pit stops required to complete the race. The road courses on the schedule may see as few as two scheduled stops; oval race tracks generally see between four and six scheduled stops. Races at short tracks such as Bristol Motor Speedway and Martinsville Speedway are short enough to be completed with only two scheduled stops for fuel, but teams plan on more stops due to rapid tire wear and significant loss of cornering speed on worn tires. If one team pits for tires and is considerably faster (between 1 and 3 seconds per lap), then teams will usually follow quickly to avoid losing time. Pit strategy can play a significant role in the outcome of a NASCAR race, perhaps more so than other racing series. Under caution, most teams use similar strategies to avoid being caught alone, typically following the leader's decision to stay out or pit, but sometimes teams will deliberately pit \\"off-sequence\\" if they feel they can gain an advantage later. Race tactics can affect strategy as well. Late in a race, drivers can reduce throttle input to save fuel at the cost of slower lap times, but by doing so they can stretch their pit window to the end of the race and skip the final pit stop. A late caution can force teams to make a tough call: Stay out on worn tires, or pit and give up track position. The green-white-checker rule can cause headaches, as it can potentially extend the race an unknown number of both green-flag and yellow-flag laps. Furthermore, strategy can be determined by qualifying position. A team that qualifies in the top six positions will have the best choice of pit stalls, most often choosing the first, last, or a stall with an opening either in front of or behind that one. A team that qualifies deeper in the field will have a greater opportunity to be stacked behind cars during a pit stop, slowing them down. = NASCAR pit crew roles = Typical pit box in NASCAR Pit crew on Alex Bowman's car at Dover International Speedway in 2019. * The crew chief is the leader of the pit crew. They are responsible for all aspects of the crew, car set-up (from the construction of the car at the shop down to in-race handling adjustments), and at-track activities. They call the team's pit strategy (usually with the help of one or more race engineers who monitor telemetry) and will hire a pit crew coach to help coordinate the pit stops and train the pit crew members to stay in good physical shape. NASCAR regulations dictate that only five individuals can go \\"over the wall\\" to service a racecar during a pit stop. The tool limits on the crew are two impact wrenches, one jack, and two cans of gasoline. Other tools may be used if needed, but major work must be performed in the garage area. An important tool used by the crew chief is referred to as the pit box, but colloquially called the \\"war wagon\\". The pit box is generally equipped with flat-screen monitors and the television broadcast of the event. These tools are used to help analyze the car up close during any moment of the race. * The car chief performs a majority of the scheduling and day-to-day preparations at the shop prior to the race weekend. This person is responsible for managing the crew throughout the weekend, ensuring that the car meets all of NASCAR's inspection requirements, and overseeing changes to the car requested by the crew chief or the team engineer. This role is similar to that of a chief operating officer's in general. If the crew chief is not able to attend the race, the car chief will occasionally serve as interim crew chief. *The jackman raises each side of the car so that the tires can be replaced. This person must do this quickly with the use of a 22-pound (10 kg) floor jack. while also removing and reinstalling the rear tires since the removal of the rear tire carrier. The jackman signals for the driver to leave the pits by lowering the car. *The two tire changers remove and tighten the lug nuts on the tires using a specification impact wrench (or \\"air gun\\") made by Paoli (prior to the 2018 season, air guns were open to development, and top teams often built their own from scratch). One tire changer is solely responsible for the front tires, while the other is responsible for the rears. NASCAR requires a wheel to have five traditional lug nuts, as opposed to the single locking lug nut seen in other professional racing categories. Many jackmen watch the tire changers to make sure the lug nuts are tight, as NASCAR rules state that all five lug nuts must be in contact with the wheel. *The gas man fills the car with Sunoco Green E15 racing fuel using a special gas can. The gas man is normally prohibited from doing any other work during a stop, but may also help pull old tires from the race car after lug nuts are loosened if the car does not need fuel. Prior to the 2011 season, an additional crewman (the \\"catch-can\\" man) was allowed over the wall to hold a special can over the car's fuel system overflow port to collect any spilled fuel. NASCAR disallowed the catch-can man in 2011; now the fuel cans are self-venting to reduce spillage. *The tire carrier brings new outside tires over the pit wall and removes and installs the front tires. They must maintain control of old tires as they are being taken back to the wall, where additional team members will have the new inside tires ready and waiting. The front tire carrier is usually responsible for pulling damaged front fenders away from the tire if necessary. He may also be responsible for cleaning and adding or removing tape to/from the grille during a pit stop in order to adjust front-end downforce and engine temperatures. *The utility man is only permitted over the wall in the second half of the race (sometimes earlier if conditions and NASCAR dictate otherwise). He may clean the windshield and provide the driver with fresh drinking water and other necessities, but he may not make any other adjustments to the car.  IndyCar Series  Pit stops during the 2017 Rainguard Water Sealers 600 at Texas Motor Speedway. In the IndyCar Series, a pit stop is a more complex operation than in NASCAR, but far less so than in Formula One. Rules permit six mechanics over the pit wall during a stop. The pit rules and procedures have origins in USAC National Championship racing. The spare fuel for IndyCar competition is stored in large pitside fuel tanks. Each team's tank is filled to a specified volume of fuel, depending upon the race distance. Teams are also given a certain allotment of spare tires sets, likewise owing to the race distance. All of the spare tires are pre-mounted on wheels before the race. During a routine pit stop, the tires are laid out beforehand, and three of the four tire changers are pre-positioned before the car enters its pit stall. The fourth tire changer, whose responsibility is the rear tire on the far side of pit road from the pit wall, does not take his position until after the car arrives, due to a rule against having the car run over the feed hose for the impact wrench used to change the tires, and a prohibition of using an overhead boom to support air hoses. As a result, the outside rear changer also serves to wave at the driver to inform him of where his pit box is while holding the air hose up. As soon as the car comes to a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a mechanic to activate the car's built-in pneumatic jacks. A pressurized air hose is inserted into a receiving nozzle at the rear of the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A fueling hose is inserted into a socket (called the \\"buckeye\\"), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car's fuel tank. The fuel hose has a built-in vent/overflow hose as part of the mechanism, an invention of the mid-2000s. Previously, a second \\"vent hose\\" was utilized, but it was phased out to improve safety. Simultaneously, the four tire changers remove the wheels and install the new ones. IndyCar wheels are affixed to the hubs with a single lug nut, making it easier and faster to change them. After the tire changes are complete, the front tire changers may use manual adjusters to adjust the angle of the car's front wing, remove debris from air intakes, or make other minor repairs. While the service is being completed by the over-the-wall crew, another crew member behind the wall may use a stick to offer the driver a refreshment. After the tire changes are complete, the air jack hose is removed, dropping the car to the ground. However, the driver usually must wait additional seconds until the refueling is complete. The right front tire changer (who is usually also the crew chief) signals the driver when the stop is complete. Before the car departs its pit stall, a crew member must squirt water to wash any excess spilled fuel from the fuel buckeye; this is usually done with a pressurized water hose by a crew member behind the pit wall. Under normal conditions, a routine stop for an IndyCar team lasts between six and ten seconds. IndyCar teams are permitted to set their own pit strategies.  Super Formula  In Super Formula, Japan's top- level single-seater series, a total of six mechanics are allowed to work on a car. Of these six, three have fixed roles: the lollipop-signalman, the refueler, and the fire-fighter. They are forbidden from undertaking any other function during the pit stop. The remaining three mechanics are responsible for all other operations, most notably jacking up the car and changing the tyres. The general strategy is to have the three free mechanics operate on the car in an assembly-line-like manner, moving around the car between different stations. Because of the limited personnel, teams often come up with creative solutions to decrease pit stop times. For example, some teams employ an automatic front jack, which is placed in front of the car as it stops. Mechanics might also jump over the nose-cone of the car to save time getting to the other side. With the automatic front jack, a Super Formula pit stop takes between ten to twelve seconds; even without the automatic jack, pit stops can be completed in as little as fourteen seconds.  Endurance racing  United Autosports performs a pit stop during the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the various forms of sports car endurance racing, pit stops are a more leisurely affair, but no less important than in other forms of racing. While stops take longer, much more routine maintenance is scheduled during such pit stops, needed to keep the car running for as long as twenty-four hours; this includes major aerodynamic changes to deal with the changing temperature in such a long race, and replacement of certain wear-limited parts, such as brake pads. Due to the fact that the race is scheduled to last a certain length of time rather than a specific distance, pit strategies are generally not designed to be synchronised with the race distance, but rather to happen on a schedule based on the car's requirements for routine service. Under the rules of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) only five mechanics are permitted to work on the car. One man is permitted to fuel the car; all fuelling must be completed before any other service occurs. The other four mechanics on pit lane at any given time are typically two tyre changers and two tyre carriers, each of whom handles his task on only one side of the car. Automatic pneumatic jacks are used, integrated into the car itself. At all times the car's engine must be shut off during the stop, and may start only when the stop has concluded. IMSA allows only four mechanics to service a car during a pit stop. One crew member will refuel the car while the other three are responsible for changing tyres and operating the pneumatic jacks. A fifth crew-member must serve as the team's designated firefighter and must stand ready in the pit stall with a fire extinguisher while the car is being refuelled. A sixth crew- member may assist in a driver change. Neither the firefighter or driver's assistant may perform any additional service to the car.Grand-am.com 2009 Sporting Regulations, Retrieved January 25, 2009 Unlike the ACO, IMSA does not force crews to wait for fuelling to complete before changing tyres, and does not require the car's engine be shut off during the stop. Michael Shank Racing Acura performs a pit stop during 2018 Petit Le Mans. In endurance racing, driver changes are mandatory; the shortest endurance races are scheduled for four hours, one hour longer than the longest nonstop time permitted behind the wheel. During a pit stop with a driver change, the new driver and a driver change assistant are permitted into the pit lane. The assistant, who may not do any mechanical work on the car, is tasked with helping the current driver out of the car, removing or swapping driver seat inserts, helping the new driver into the car, and helping the new driver tightly fasten his safety harness and connect his various helmet connections to the car's systems, including the two-way team radio and the drink bottle used to stave off dehydration. A routine pit stop with no scheduled maintenance and no driver change generally lasts from thirty to forty seconds. With a driver change included, that time increases by about ten seconds. Should there be significant scheduled maintenance, such as changing brake pads, the stop can easily last well more than a minute. Unlike most other forms of racing, the practice of \\"double-stinting\\" or even \\"triple-stinting\\" tyres is commonplace in longer races; tyres hard enough to withstand the rigours of racing in the heat of the daytime may be so hard that they do not wear significantly during the nighttime hours. In a race where this is an issue, significant time can be gained by choosing to leave worn tyres on the car during the first stop after they were put on the car; if the temperature drops low enough, teams may even be able to go two pit stops without changing tyres.  Notable pit stops  *1963 Daytona 500: Wood Brothers Racing developed choreographed pit stops to reduce the amount of time spent on pit road. Driver Tiny Lund spent so little time on pit road that he went on to win the race without changing his tyres once. For this, Wood Brothers Racing is often credited with inventing the modern pit stop. *1965 Indianapolis 500: Wood Brothers Racing was invited by Ford to service the Lotus 38-Ford driven by Scottish Formula One driver Jim Clark. This brought their new concept of fast pit stops into open-wheel racing. Clark won the race with an average speed of 150.686 (a new Indianapolis 500 record). This was Ford's first win at Indianapolis. *1976 Indianapolis 500: A world record was set for time taken in a pit-stop when Bobby Unser pitted in four seconds. *1981 Daytona 500: During the final round of pit stops, Richard Petty's crew called off a planned tyre change, and serviced fuel only. The lightning-fast stop put Petty back on the track in the lead, and he held off a shocked Bobby Allison for a record seventh Daytona 500 victory. *1982 Indianapolis 500: Gordon Johncock and Rick Mears were running together on the track as they approached their final pit stops. Johncock's crew saved time by giving him just enough fuel to finish the race, sending him out with an 11-second lead. The better-handling Mears closed the gap but ran out of laps as Johncock hung on to win by 0.16 seconds. *1989 Portuguese Grand Prix: Nigel Mansell came in too fast and missed his pit box. He then reversed back to take his spot, and mechanics changed the tyres. Due to reversing in pit lane (as opposed to waiting for the mechanics to push him back), he was disqualified. He did not acknowledge the black flag, later collided with Ayrton Senna and was subsequently given a one-race suspension. *1991 First Union 400: After an offseason of discussion at the end of the NASCAR season during the Atlanta Journal 500 when Melling Racing rear tyre changer Mike Rich was killed by Ricky Rudd's car going out of control during a pit stop, NASCAR experimented with various rules on tyre changes in an attempt to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The first was to only allow tyre changes during green flag racing, with the first lap after the restart being assigned to cars that started in odd-numbered starting positions, and the second lap after restart for even-numbered starting positions. The rule was unpopular, and teams began to change tyres only for regularly scheduled times under the green flag. After the first five races, NASCAR experimented with a rule for the Valleydale Meats 500 in Bristol. The same odd-even rules were used for the first two laps of a pit stop under caution, with the cars starting double-file, with the odd cars on the inside and even cars on the outside. After more complaints, for the seventh race, at North Wilkesboro Speedway, NASCAR reverted to the rules prior to the 1990 crash, along with a new rule mandating a pit lane speed limit. By the middle of the 1990s, almost all motorsport began enforcing a pit lane speed limit. *1991 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach: Michael Andretti's pit service was complete as he passed by Emerson Fittipaldi, who began exiting his pit area. Fittipaldi was apparently unaware that Andretti was approaching, and as the two made wheel-to wheel contact Andretti's car was launched into the air. Andretti's damaged car slid into another pit stall, but, though very angry, he walked away uninjured. As this incident took place in the wake of the aforementioned First Union 400, this incident prompted CART to mandate pit lane speed limits. *1991 Portuguese Grand Prix: Nigel Mansell lost a wheel instantly after making his stop. The mechanics put the wheel back on in the middle of pit road, and Mansell was disqualified for the second time in three years in the event. *1993 European Grand Prix: On lap 57, Ayrton Senna came into the pit lane for a tyre change but aborted the stop and drove straight through instead. In the process, he ended up setting the fastest lap of the race, due to both the unique configuration of Donington Park's pit lane, and the lack of pit lane speed limits in F1 at the time (which would be introduced the following year after Senna's death). *1993 Australian Grand Prix: McLaren's Ayrton Senna came into the pit unexpectedly for new tyres; the team serviced the car in under four seconds. *1994 San Marino Grand Prix: Michele Alboreto lost a wheel after his pit stop. The wheel caused injuries to mechanics from Ferrari and Lotus. Following this and other tragic events during the weekend, the pit lane speed limit was introduced in Formula One. *1994 German Grand Prix: Benetton driver Jos Verstappen came into the pits; while refuelling, some fuel was accidentally sprayed onto the hot bodywork of the car ‚Äì a few seconds later the fuel ignited and Verstappen's car was engulfed in a ball of flames. Verstappen escaped the incident with burns around his eyes, as he had his visor up during the pit stop. *1995 Spanish Grand Prix: Johnny Herbert exited his pit box with the rear jack still attached to his car. It fell off harmlessly at the pit lane exit. *1996 24 Hours of Daytona: Max Papis was charging around the track on the final stint of the race, trying to catch the leader. On his final pit stop, Papis entered the pit area at full speed (~200 mph). Despite still finishing second, the startling sight helped earn him the name \\"Mad Max.\\" This is no longer possible, as almost all federations controlling motorsport have adopted pit lane speed limits because of crew safety. *1998 British Grand Prix: Two laps from the finish, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was issued with a ten-second penalty, meaning he had to drive through the pit lane obeying the speed limit, stop at the penalty box (not the team's pit box), and remain stationary for ten seconds before leaving the pits and continuing with the race. On the final lap of the race, Schumacher came in to serve the penalty and in doing so crossed the finish line (which extends across the pit lane) before reaching his pit box and before Mika H√§kkinen crossed the finish line on the race track. *1999 Portland Grand Prix: Gil de Ferran was leading but had insufficient fuel to make it to the finish. Rather than try to conserve fuel, de Ferran's Walker Racing team instructed him to drive all-out to build enough of a margin to make an extra pit stop. The strategy was a gamble as a yellow flag would bunch the field and wipe out any margin de Ferran built. The green flag stayed out, de Ferran pitted without losing the lead and he went on to take the team's first win in four years. *2001 24 Hours of Le Mans: Joest Racing changed the transaxle on their Audi R8 (a process that usually takes hours) in less than 5 minutes. They went on to win the overall race. *2002 UAW-Daimler Chrysler 400: Sterling Marlin of Chip Ganassi Racing spun while attempting to make a late race pit stop, causing him to break the pit road speed limit. At the time, NASCAR's penalty for speeding while entering pit road was to hold the driver in his pit stall for an additional 15 seconds. The official in Marlin's pit was not informed of the penalty until after the crew released the car. NASCAR determined that they had no precedent for forcing Marlin to return to the pits as his early release was their mistake (and they could not order him back for a stop and go penalty). Marlin won the race by 1.163 seconds.USAToday\\"Without penalty, Marlin speeds to Las Vegas win\\" Retrieved January 12, 2009 Following the incident, NASCAR amended its rules so that all green flag speeding violations are enforced with a drive through penalty (forcing the driver to travel the length of pit road at the speed limit). *2002 The Winston: Roush Racing's Jeff Burton made a pit stop on the final lap of the first 40-lap segment. A pit stop for tyres was mandatory during the segment, but the rule did not stipulate when it had to be taken. By selecting a pit stall only 100 yards shy of the start/finish line, Burton did not have to spend the time all the other drivers took traveling the entire length of pit road.USAToday.com \\"Newman captures The Winston all-star event\\" 2/18/08 Since Sprint All-Star Race XIX, the rule was modified to mandate the stop within a specific number of laps in the race. *2008 Canadian Grand Prix: Ferrari's Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen came to a stop at the end of the pit lane as the exit was closed, with the red indicator light on. R√§ikk√∂nen was alongside BMW's Robert Kubica at the end of the pit lane when Lewis Hamilton sped towards them not noticing the red light at first. Hamilton slid into the back of R√§ikk√∂nen's car, with Nico Rosberg further hitting the back of Hamilton. Both Hamilton and R√§ikk√∂nen retired from the race, each leaving their vehicles at the exit of the pitlane. Both Hamilton and Rosberg were penalised a 10 place grid penalty at the next Grand Prix in France. *2008 Singapore Grand Prix: Ferrari's Felipe Massa drove off with the fuel hose still attached to the car knocking down a member of the pit crew while he attempted to head back to the track as he was mistakenly shown the green signal. The problem was later attributed to the failure of Ferrari's automated light system. This being the first night race in F1, the Ferrari team subsequently resumed the use of the traditional lollipop man for the remainder of the season.sportinglife.com \\"MASSA RUES PIT-LANE ERROR\\" 29/09/08 *2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: McLaren's Lewis Hamilton entered the pit lane and had his service in 3.19 seconds followed seconds later by teammate Jenson Button having a 4-second pit stop. *2012 Chinese Grand Prix: The Ferrari team completed a pit stop for Fernando Alonso in 2.4 seconds. *2012 German Grand Prix: The McLaren team completed a pit stop for Jenson Button in 2.31 seconds. *2013 Malaysian Grand Prix: McLaren's previous record of 2.31s was bettered six times during the course of the race, the fastest of which came from Infiniti Red Bull Racing's pit stop for Mark Webber, completing the stop in 2.05 seconds. Lewis Hamilton also had a notable pitstop after accidentally driving his Mercedes car into the McLaren pits, after only moving from the team two races prior. *2013 German Grand Prix: Mark Webber was released from the pit box before his right-rear wheel was properly fitted on. The tyre came loose as he drove down the pit lane and hit a cameraman. This led to increased pit lane safety measures being implemented, including mandatory head protection for all team members working on a car during a pit stop, a reduced pit lane speed limit, and restricted access for the media into the pit lane. *2013 GoPro Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma: While exiting his pit stall, race contender Scott Dixon struck Will Power's right rear tyre carrier, who was thrown into another pit crew member, while another member of Power's crew was injured by an air gun. Dixon was penalised for the incident, but he believed the tyre carrier had intentionally walked in front of his car. Power would go on to win the race, while Dixon's penalty relegated him to 21st, and a final finishing position of 15th. *2013 Japanese Grand Prix: The Ferrari team completed a pit stop for Fernando Alonso in 1.95 seconds. *2013 US Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing Team completed a pit stop for Mark Webber which they timed at 1.923 seconds.Formula1Onlive \\"Red Bull Racing sets new F1 pitstop world record \\", Formula1Onlive.

Two laps later, his teammate Romain Grosjean was also released with a loose wheel, forcing both drivers to retire. Haas was fined ‚Ç¨10,000 for the unsafe pit releases. *2018 Bahrain Grand Prix: During Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen's second pit stop, his Ferrari struck tyre changer Francesco Cigarini's left leg as it left the pit box, fracturing Cigarini's tibia and fibula. The cause of the incident was a sensor confusion in the Ferrari pit box light system. *2019 DXC Technology 600: Having led the race from pole position, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing's Takuma Sato entered the pits for his first stop at the end of lap 62 and overshot his pit box, hooking the inside air hoses and lollipop on his car and launching the inside front tire changer into the next pit box. The crewman was uninjured, but the lengthy pitstop- and subsequent penalty for hitting pit equipment, left Sato 3 laps down and out of contention. *2019 British Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing team completed a 1.91 pit stop for Pierre Gasly, making it the third fastest pit stop in F1 and overall. *2019 German Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing team completed a pit stop for Max Verstappen in 1.88 seconds,, making it the second fastest pit stop in F1 and overall. *2019 Brazilian Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing team completed a pit stop for Max Verstappen in 1.82 seconds,, making it the fastest pit stop ever in F1 and overall.

They play in the Swiss Super League. Servette is one of Switzerland's most successful clubs and the most successful club from the Francophone part of the country, winning 17 national titles, as well as 7 Swiss cups. Founded in 1890, the team has spent the majority of its history in the top flight of Swiss football, regularly contesting for the title with rivals Grasshopper Z√ºrich. However, after their last league title in 1998, Servette began experiencing financial problems, which led to a turbulent decade. The club was relegated to the third division in 2004‚Äì05 due to a bankruptcy, but achieved promotion to the Swiss Challenge League after the 2005‚Äì06 season, where the club remained until 2011. Servette earned promotion to the Swiss Super League after defeating Bellinzona in a relegation/promotion playoff on 31 May 2011. The club finished fourth in its first season back in the top flight, thereby gaining entrance to the Europa League second round qualification round for the 2012‚Äì13 season. However, they were relegated at the end of the 2013 season. They are back in Swiss first tier in 2019, being promoted from a playoff against FC Lausanne-Sport.  History  Chart of FC Servette table positions in the Swiss football league system FC Servette defender Jean-Claude Schindelholz with coach B√©la Guttmann on a bus in Holland, 1966. = Early years to bankruptcy = Founded in 1890, Servette was the leading club in French-speaking Switzerland, having won 17 Swiss league championships and seven Swiss cups. Servette were also winners of the Torneo Internazionale Stampa Sportiva, one of the first international football competitions in the world, in 1908. In 1930 Servette organized Coupe des Nations, the predecessor of UEFA Champions League. Led by Umberto Barberis and Claude \\"Didi\\" Andrey, in 1978‚Äì1979 the club won all of the competitions it entered ‚Äì with the exception of the European Cup Winners' Cup where they were eliminated in the quarter-finals on away goals by Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, that year's finalist. Barberis later became French champion in 1982 with AS Monaco. Until its bankruptcy, Servette was the only Swiss club to have remained in the top league since its creation in 1890. Servette remained the only club to have never been relegated for sporting reasons, until they finished at the last place, following the 2012‚Äì2013 season. = Bankruptcy and revival = Old Servette FC Logo On 4 February 2005, the parent company of the club was declared bankrupt. It had run debts of over 10 million Swiss francs, having not paid the players since the previous November, and consequently the club suffered an exodus of players looking for paying clubs. As a consequence of the bankruptcy Servette Under 21s took over the club name playing two divisions below the original Servette team in 1. Liga, a fate already experienced by regional rivals Lausanne Sports in 2003, and continued to play at the Stade de Geneve in front of smaller crowds. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, a rejuvenated Servette secured promotion to the Challenge League, the second highest division in Switzerland. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Servette finished 2nd in the Challenge League, thereby qualifying for a relegation/promotion play- off against Super League team AC Bellinzona. Servette lost the initial match in Bellinzona 1‚Äì0, but won the return match 3‚Äì1 and winning the tie 3‚Äì2 on aggregate, securing promotion to the Swiss Super League. = 2011 to present = During the Summer 2011 transfer window, Servette FC made very few signings, considering the club had been promoted from the second division to the Super League. Barroca, Issaga Diallo, Carlos Saleiro and Abdoulaye Fall (the latter failed to receive a work permit) were signed as permanent transfers, in addition to Ishmael Yartey and Roderick Miranda joining the club on loan from Benfica. Costinha, a former Portugal international and Champions League winner with FC Porto, was appointed as the club's Sporting Director, after he had been previously fired by Sporting Lisbon. With a largely unchanged squad from their previous season in the second division, Servette achieved very impressive results in the first half of the season, including victories over FC Zurich, BSC Young Boys, Neuchatel Xamax, FC Lucerne, local rivals FC Lausanne-Sport and a 4‚Äì0 away win over arch-rivals FC Sion. Despite achieving overall impressive results in the first half of the season, manager Jo√£o Alves was fired, and was replaced by his compatriot Jo√£o Pereira, to the disappointment of many of Servette's supporters. In December 2011, reports surfaced that Servette was unable to pay players' salaries, in addition to other expenses. In January 2012, one of the club's star performers and leading goalscorers, Mat√≠as Vitkieviez, was sold to Young Boys for only 150,000 CHF. In February 2012, Servette filed for bankruptcy a second time. On 12 March 2012, chairman Majid Pishyar sold the club to a consortium headed by Hugh Quennec, president of the city's hockey club, Gen√®ve-Servette HC. The club was initially given one month to secure the funding necessary to come out of bankruptcy proceedings, and was successful in doing so. Pishyar remains as \\"honorary president\\" through the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. In April 2012, the decision was made to reinstate manager Jo√£o Alves, who had achieved promotion and impressive results in the first half of the season, and to fire his replacement Jo√£o Pereira, who had failed to improve the club's results. Alves' return immediately led to improved results, and the club finished the season's final five matches with four wins and one draw. This included a 2‚Äì1 victory over FC Basel on the final day of the season, which ended a run of 17 consecutive losses against FC Basel dating back to 2001, as well as ending Basel's 26 match unbeaten streak. The victory also meant that Servette secured fourth place in their first season back in Switzerland's top flight, granting Servette entry into the second round of qualifying for the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Europa League. The season ended with further good news, as on 24 May 2012, the Swiss Football League granted Servette its license for the 2012‚Äì13 season, thus marking the end of Servette's financial worries for the time being. Servette announced that it would be preparing for the 2012‚Äì13 season with friendly matches against Thun, Shakhtar Donetsk, Yverdon-Sport, √âtoile Carouge, Lausanne-Sport and Porto. In the transfer market, Servette sold St√©phane Nater and Carlos Saleiro, while Ishmael Yartey and Roderick Miranda were recalled to Benfica from their loan spells. Servette bolstered its ranks by signing Geoffrey Tr√©and, Alexandre Pasche, Christopher Mfuyi, Kevin Gissi, Simone Grippo, Mike Gomes, and Samir Ramizi. Servette also brought in Gens√©ric Kusunga, Steven Lang, and Kelvin on loan for the season. On 12 July 2012, it was confirmed that Servette would face Gandzasar FC in the second round of qualifying for the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Europa League. The club won the tie 5‚Äì1, progressing to face Rosenborg BK in the third qualifier round, against whom they were eliminated on away goals. Servette's league campaign, meanwhile, went poorly, and the club was relegated (for sporting reasons) for the first time in its 113-year history in May 2013, following a 3‚Äì0 away defeat by relegation rivals FC Lausanne-Sport. On 14 July 2013, Servette began the 2013‚Äì14 season in the Swiss Challenge League with a 2‚Äì1 win at FC Wohlen. After finishing 2nd in the 2014‚Äì15 Swiss Challenge League, the Swiss Football League refused Servette FC a Challenge League licence meaning that Servette would play in the 1st Promotion League (third tier) during 2015‚Äì16. In June 2015 the club held a press conference where it was revealed that Servette FC had new owners ‚Äì 1890 Foundation ‚Äì holding 100% of the capital stock of SFC SA. At the same press conference it was declared that 1890 Foundation was a private foundation subject to scrutiny by the public supervisory authority. While Kevin Cooper stayed on as coach, many players left. On 3 November 2015, Servette FC announced that Kevin Cooper had left the club and William Niederhauser and Thierry Cotting would be temporarily in charge of first team affairs. In January 2016 the club announced that Anthony Braizat had taken charge of first team affairs.  Stadium  The home ground of Servette is the Stade de Gen√®ve. It was inaugurated on 16 March 2003 after three years of construction. The opening match was played between Servette and Young Boys. With an all-seater capacity of 30,084, the Stade de Gen√®ve is the third largest stadium in Switzerland, and hosted three group matches in the 2008 European Football Championship. Servette moved to the Stade de Gen√®ve from their old ground, the Stade des Charmilles, in 2003. The Charmilles was inaugurated on 28 June 1930, with the first game drawing a crowd of 14,000 on the first match of the Coupe des Nations. The official capacity peaked at 30,000, but a record 40,000 spectators managed to squeeze in for the international game between Switzerland and France on 14 October 1951. Flood lights were installed in 1977 and the stands were entirely covered in 1983. The capacity gradually diminished from the 1980s onward, first to 20,000 in 1985 and then to 9,250 in 1998 when the stadium became an all-seater. Plans for a new stadium were first launched in 1984, in response to the Charmilles becoming increasingly outdated and run down. A project committee was established in 1992, which proposed to either rebuild the stadium over the course of four years or construct a new stadium elsewhere in Geneva. Meanwhile, with more substantial plans failing to materialize, the poor state of the old stadium became apparent when the main stand, the Tribune A, was declared unsafe in 1995 and closed off. A renovation project began the following year, which saw the main stand re-opened and seats eventually being installed throughout the stadium. Servette would secure another Swiss Championship and a Cup trophy while playing at the Charmilles, before construction on the new Stade de Gen√®ve finally commenced in 2000. The last match was played on 8 December 2002 in front of a capacity crowd.

This Flamboyant Gothic tower is all that remains of the former 16th-century Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie (\\"Saint James of the butchers\\"), which was demolished in 1797, during the French Revolution, leaving only the tower. What remains of the destroyed church of Saint-Jacques- de-la-Boucherie is now considered a national historic landmark. History Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie church on the map of Truschet and Hoyau (1550) =The Way of St. James= The tower's rich decoration reflects the wealth of its patrons, the wholesale butchers of the nearby Les Halles market. The masons in charge were Jean de Felin, Julien M√©nart and Jean de Revier. It was built in 1509 to 1523, during the reign of King Francis I. With a dedication to Saint James the Greater, the ancient churchThe Historia Caroli Magni, a legendarium concerning Charlemagne, pseudepigraphically ascribed to Charlemagne's contemporary Turpin, Archbishop of Reims, affirms that the church had been founded by Charlemagne. and its landmark tower welcomed pilgrims setting out on the road that led to Tours and headed for the Way of St James, which led to the major pilgrimage destination of Santiago de Compostela. A relic of the saint preserved in the church linked it the more strongly and in modern times occasioned its listing in 1998 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO among the sites and structures marking the chemins de Compostelle, the pilgrimage routes in France that led like tributaries of a great stream headed towards Santiago in the northwest of Spain. =Nineteenth century= Saint-Jacques Tower circa 1867 The church, with the exception of the tower, was demolished in 1793; preservation of the tower was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials. In 1824 it was being used as a shot tower to make small shot. It was repurchased by the City of Paris in 1836 and declared a Monument Historique in 1862. A statue of the saint was installed on the top of the tower during the 19th century. During the Second Empire, the architect Th√©odore Ballu restored the tower, placing it on a pedestal and designing a small city park around it. This coincided with the construction of the rue de Rivoli and the avenue Victoria nearby, requiring huge quantities of earth to be removed to ensure the rue de Rivoli a smooth flat path. The pedestal allowed the tower to retain its original elevation: nowadays, the change in ground level can best be appreciated in rue St-Bon, just northeast of the tower, where a staircase leads up to the original street level at rue de la Verrerie. A statue of Blaise Pascal is located at the base of the tower, commemorating the experiments on atmospheric pressure, though it is debated whether they were performed here or at the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut- Pas. A meteorological laboratory is also installed at the top of the tower. The tower inspired Alexandre Dumas to write the play La tour Saint-Jacques-de- la-boucherie in 1856. Gustave Le Gray, Tour St-Jacques, 1859 Nicolas Flamel, a patron of the church, was buried under its floor. =Modern restoration= The tower was surrounded by scaffolding and obscured by sheeting for some years as surveyors investigated the condition of the stone. Recent findings show that most of the stone and its ornamentation originates from the late-medieval era of the tower's construction, and was not added by the 19th-century restorers. Unfortunately, the survey also indicates serious cracking. The top three quarters of sheeting were taken down in March 2008, revealing a renovated upper section of the tower. From October 2008 to February 2009, the scaffolds and sheeting were completely removed and the surrounding park's landscaping was being restored. Finally, on 18 April 2009, the park was re-opened to the public.Jean-Fran√ßois Lagneau, \\"La restauration de la tour Saint-Jacques\\", Monumental (Les √âditions du patrimoine, no semestriel 2), 2008 Gallery Turgot map Paris KU 10.jpgSaint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie and its surroundings on the Turgot map of Paris (1736) Tour Saint-Jacques 2008.jpgSaint-Jacques Tower as seen from the Conciergerie, with the \\"Victory Column\\" of Place du Ch√¢telet in 2008 Tour saint-Jacques √† Paris novembre 2007.JPGRestoration of the Saint-Jacques Tower in November 2007 File:Tour Saint-Jacques au cr√©puscule.jpg Saint-Jacques tower at dusk, 2015 Tour Saint-Jacques 070508 01.jpgPinnacle sculpture by Paul Chenillon See also * Fontaine du Palmier * Place du Chatelet References  External links  * Category:1525 establishments in France Category:16th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Monuments and memorials in Paris Category:Monuments historiques of Paris Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1523 Category:Roman Catholic churches in the 4th arrondissement of Paris Category:Towers completed in the 16th century Category:Towers in France Category:World Heritage Sites in France ","title":"Tour Saint-Jacques"},{"id":"893516","text":"In group theory, a branch of mathematics, a core is any of certain special normal subgroups of a group. The two most common types are the normal core of a subgroup and the p-core of a group. The normal core =Definition= For a group G, the normal core or normal interiorRobinson (1996) p.16 of a subgroup H is the largest normal subgroup of G that is contained in H (or equivalently, the intersection of the conjugates of H). More generally, the core of H with respect to a subset S‚äÜG is the intersection of the conjugates of H under S, i.e. :\\\\mathrm{Core}_S(H) := \\\\bigcap_{s \\\\in S}{s^{-1}Hs}. Under this more general definition, the normal core is the core with respect to S=G. The normal core of any normal subgroup is the subgroup itself. =Significance= Normal cores are important in the context of group actions on sets, where the normal core of the isotropy subgroup of any point acts as the identity on its entire orbit. Thus, in case the action is transitive, the normal core of any isotropy subgroup is precisely the kernel of the action. A core-free subgroup is a subgroup whose normal core is the trivial subgroup. Equivalently, it is a subgroup that occurs as the isotropy subgroup of a transitive, faithful group action. The solution for the hidden subgroup problem in the abelian case generalizes to finding the normal core in case of subgroups of arbitrary groups. The p-core In this section G will denote a finite group, though some aspects generalize to locally finite groups and to profinite groups. =Definition= For a prime p, the p-core of a finite group is defined to be its largest normal p-subgroup. It is the normal core of every Sylow p-subgroup of the group. The p-core of G is often denoted O_p(G), and in particular appears in one of the definitions of the Fitting subgroup of a finite group. Similarly, the p‚Ä≤-core is the largest normal subgroup of G whose order is coprime to p and is denoted O_{p'}(G). In the area of finite insoluble groups, including the classification of finite simple groups, the 2‚Ä≤-core is often called simply the core and denoted O(G). This causes only a small amount of confusion, because one can usually distinguish between the core of a group and the core of a subgroup within a group. The p‚Ä≤,p-core, denoted O_{p',p}(G) is defined by O_{p',p}(G)/O_{p'}(G) = O_p(G/O_{p'}(G)). For a finite group, the p‚Ä≤,p-core is the unique largest normal p-nilpotent subgroup. The p-core can also be defined as the unique largest subnormal p-subgroup; the p‚Ä≤-core as the unique largest subnormal p‚Ä≤-subgroup; and the p‚Ä≤,p-core as the unique largest subnormal p-nilpotent subgroup. The p‚Ä≤ and p‚Ä≤,p-core begin the upper p-series. For sets œÄ1, œÄ2, ..., œÄn+1 of primes, one defines subgroups OœÄ1, œÄ2, ..., œÄn+1(G) by: :O_{\\\\pi_1,\\\\pi_2,\\\\dots,\\\\pi_{n+1}}(G)/O_{\\\\pi_1,\\\\pi_2,\\\\dots,\\\\pi_{n}}(G) = O_{\\\\pi_{n+1}}( G/O_{\\\\pi_1,\\\\pi_2,\\\\dots,\\\\pi_{n}}(G) ) The upper p-series is formed by taking œÄ2i‚àí1 = p‚Ä≤ and œÄ2i = p; there is also a lower p-series. A finite group is said to be p-nilpotent if and only if it is equal to its own p‚Ä≤,p-core. A finite group is said to be p-soluble if and only if it is equal to some term of its upper p-series; its p-length is the length of its upper p-series. A finite group G is said to be p-constrained for a prime p if C_G(O_{p',p}(G)/O_{p'}(G)) \\\\subseteq O_{p',p}(G). Every nilpotent group is p-nilpotent, and every p-nilpotent group is p-soluble. Every soluble group is p-soluble, and every p-soluble group is p-constrained. A group is p-nilpotent if and only if it has a normal p-complement, which is just its p‚Ä≤-core. =Significance= Just as normal cores are important for group actions on sets, p-cores and p‚Ä≤-cores are important in modular representation theory, which studies the actions of groups on vector spaces. The p-core of a finite group is the intersection of the kernels of the irreducible representations over any field of characteristic p. For a finite group, the p‚Ä≤-core is the intersection of the kernels of the ordinary (complex) irreducible representations that lie in the principal p-block. For a finite group, the p‚Ä≤,p-core is the intersection of the kernels of the irreducible representations in the principal p-block over any field of characteristic p. Also, for a finite group, the p‚Ä≤,p-core is the intersection of the centralizers of the abelian chief factors whose order is divisible by p (all of which are irreducible representations over a field of size p lying in the principal block). For a finite, p-constrained group, an irreducible module over a field of characteristic p lies in the principal block if and only if the p‚Ä≤-core of the group is contained in the kernel of the representation. =Solvable radicals= A related subgroup in concept and notation is the solvable radical. The solvable radical is defined to be the largest solvable normal subgroup, and is denoted O_\\\\infty(G). There is some variance in the literature in defining the p‚Ä≤-core of G. A few authors in only a few papers (for instance Thompson's N-group papers, but not his later work) define the p‚Ä≤-core of an insoluble group G as the p‚Ä≤-core of its solvable radical in order to better mimic properties of the 2‚Ä≤-core.

As with all other versions of the Z, the 300ZX was sold within the Japanese domestic market under the name Fairlady Z. It was sold in Japan from 1983 to 2001 and in the United States from 1984 to 1996, the 300ZX name followed the numerical convention initiated with the original Z car, the Nissan S30, which was marketed in the U.S. as the 240Z. The addition of the \\"X\\" to the car's name was a carryover from its predecessor, the 280ZX, to signify the presence of more luxury and comfort oriented features. The first generation 300ZX known as the Z31 model was produced from 1983 through 1989 and was a sales success becoming the highest volume Z-car for Nissan. To become even more competitive in the sports car market, the second generation Z32 was driven up-market. It was redesigned to be faster and feature more advanced technology, but came with a higher price than its predecessor, with consecutive price increases each model year of availability. As such, sales dwindled each year, a trend in the higher end sports car market at the time, and Nissan placed a hiatus on selling new Nissan Z-Cars to the US after the 1996 model year, though the car would continue to be sold in the Japan domestic market until 2001 in low production numbers. Car and Driver placed the Z32 on its Ten Best list for seven consecutive years, each model year of its availability in the United States. Motor Trend awarded it as the 1990 Import Car of the Year. The Nissan 350Z, officially the Z33 generation Z-Car, succeeded the 300ZX in 2003. Z31 The Z31 chassis designation was first introduced in Japan on September 16 1983, as the Fairlady Z. Designed by Kazumasu Takagi and his team of developers, the Z31 improved aerodynamics and increased power when compared to its predecessor, the 280ZX. The newer Z-car had a drag coefficient of 0.30 and was powered by Japan's first mass-produced V6 engine instead of the inline-sixes of the previous Z-cars. According to Nissan, the new V6 engine was intended to uphold the sporty, six-cylinder spirit of the original Fairlady Z, but in a more compact and efficient package. 1984 Nissan 300ZX rear 1989 Nissan 300ZX 2+2 rear Unlike its predecessors, the Z31 featured a V6 engine in the 200Z/ZS/ZG, 300ZX and 300ZR, and the only Z31 to come with an inline-six cylinder engine was the Fairlady 200ZR which was only available in Japan. The 200ZR was the last Z-car to feature a factory-installed inline six. There were five engine options in total: A turbocharged dual overhead cam 2.0 L straight- six (RB20DET, used in the 200ZR), a turbocharged single overhead cam 2.0 L V6 (VG20ET, found in the Japanese domestic market 200Z/ZS/ZG), a naturally aspirated single overhead cam 3.0 L V6 (VG30E, found in 300ZX), a turbocharged single overhead cam 3.0 L V6 (VG30ET, used in 300ZX Turbo) and a naturally aspirated dual overhead cam 3.0 L V6 (VG30DE, used in 300ZR). The Z31 had electronic fuel injection (EFI), and was rear wheel drive. The VG30 engine was either a type A or type B sub-designation from 1984 to March 1987, while models from April 1987 to 1989 had a W sub-designation. The W-series engines featured redesigned water jackets for additional cooling, and fully floating piston wrist pins. Finally, these engines were equipped with self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters. The transmissions were a 5-speed manual or an optional 4-speed automatic (all Z31 automatics were the E4N71B equipped with torque-converter lockup including turbo models). All Z31s were equipped with a Nissan R200 rear differential, April 1987 and later turbo models received an R200 clutch limited-slip differential except 1988 Shiro Specials which had a Viscous-type limited slip. Select 300ZX models (as well as some other Nissan models of the time period) could also be equipped with a digital gauge cluster that also utilized a \\"Voice Warning System\\". The Voice Warning System used the vehicle's radio and driver's door speaker to mute the radio and provide a vocal warning whenever the left or right door was ajar, the exterior lights were left on after the vehicle was turned off, parking brake was left on while trying to operate the car, or the fuel level was low. Other technological features in the 300ZX included a \\"Body Sonic\\" audio system that utilized a separate amplifier and speakers in the vehicle's front seats that allowed bass from music to be felt by the vehicle's occupants, and a fully digital climate control system. =Chassis= The Z31 chassis was based on the 280ZX. Although the newer chassis had the same wheelbase and MacPherson strut/semi-trailing arm independent suspension, it handled and accelerated better than the 280ZX it replaced. Turbocharged models, except for the Shiro Special edition, had 3-way electronically adjustable shock absorbers. The Z31 was available in either left or right hand drive. =Style and evolution= The Z31 body was slightly restyled in 1986 with the addition of side skirts, flared fenders, and sixteen inch wheels (turbo models only). Many black plastic trim pieces were also painted to match the body color, and the hood scoop was removed. The car was given a final makeover in 1987 that included more aerodynamic bumpers, fog lamps within the front air dam, and 9004 bulb-based headlamps that replaced the outdated sealed beam headlights. The 300ZX-titled reflector in the rear was updated to a narrow set of tail lights running the entire width of the car and an LED third brake light on top of the rear hatch. This was the first car in history to have the central brake light with LED, in 1987 model year, made by Stanley Electric. The Z31 continued selling until 1989, more than any other Z-Car at the time. Cars produced from 1984 to 1985 are referred to as \\"Zenki\\" models, while cars produced from 1987 to 1989 are known as \\"Kouki\\" models. The 1986 models are a special due to sharing some major features from both. They are sometimes referred to as \\"Chuki\\" models, but are usually grouped with the Zenki models because of the head and tail lights. =North American market= North America was the main market for the 300ZX, as for previous generations of the Z-car. It was introduced to the United States in October 1983, along with the remainder of Nissan's 1984 model year lineup. By now the \\"Datsun\\" nameplate had been completely retired in North America. Over 70,000 units were sold in North America in 1985 alone. There were three trim models available: SF, GL, and GLL. The SF model was only available in Canada. The new V6 (2960 cc) Single overhead cam engine was available as a naturally aspirated VG30E or a turbocharged VG30ET producing and respectively. The 1984 to 1987 turbo models featured a Garrett T3 turbocharger with a 7.8:1 compression ratio, whereas 1988 to 1989 models featured a low inertia T25 turbocharger with an increased 8.3:1 compression ratio and slightly more power ‚Äî naturally aspirated and turbocharged.Flammang, p. 175 For the 1986 model year, the base two-seater model was made available without the T-bars, creating a lower cost entry-level version.Flammang, p. 174 Special editions 1984 50th Anniversary Edition 300ZX Two Special Edition versions of the Z31 generation model were produced by Nissan; a 50th Anniversary Edition celebrated the company's semi-centennial in 1984 and offered additional luxury features, and a \\"Shiro Special\\", released four years later, with performance-oriented upgrades. The 1984 300ZX 50th Anniversary Edition, released to celebrate the automaker's half-century, was a turbocharged coup√© (two-seater) model with a Silver/Black color scheme. All 50th Anniversary Editions came equipped with a digital dash and ancillary gauges including average mileage, G-force, and compass readouts, in-car electronic adjustable shocks, Bodysonic speakers in the seats, cruise and radio controls in the steering wheel, mirrored t-tops, embroidered leather seats, embroidered floor mats, sixteen-inch (406 mm) aluminum wheels, rear fender flares, flared front fenders, a 50th AE logo badge on the driver's side front fender, and grey cloth indoor car cover with 50AE printing. The only option available to the 50th Anniversary Edition was the choice between an automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. 5,148 AE models were produced for the U.S. market and 300 for the Canadian market. A non-turbo 2+2 model was also available with 50AE badging in the Australian market. In 1988, the turbocharged Shiro Special debuted with pearl white paint, stiffer springs and matched shocks, heavy-duty anti-sway bars, a unique front air dam, paint matched wheels, Recaro seats with matching door panels, painted bumperettes, white painted door handles and a viscous limited-slip differential. No options were available for the Shiro. It was the fastest car out of Japan, capable of speeds, as tested by Motor Trend with the electronic speed limiter disabled. A total of 1,002 Shiro Special Z31s were produced for the U.S. market between January and March 1988. =Japanese market= In Japan, the Z31 was marketed as the Fairlady Z and was originally only available with two turbocharged engines: the VG20ET in the regular Fairlady Z and the VG30ET in the Fairlady Z 300ZX. Both outputs are JIS Gross and both engines use the Garrett AiResearch T03 turbocharger. The 300ZX, unencumbered by Japanese Government dimension regulations restricting overall width to less than was somewhat wider than the 2-liter models, at . Japanese 300ZX buyers were liable for additional yearly taxes that affected sales. As originally introduced, all Japanese market Fairlady Z's were slicktops, but the T-top option was made available in February 1984. The 2-liter models later gained the 200Z, 200ZG, or 200ZS monikers to help differentiate from the larger, three-liter models. They all used the VG20ET engine while the 200ZR came with the RB20DET. The 300ZX came with the VG30ET, with similar specifications to the USDM model. The only Fairlady Z variant to use the VG30DE engine, and the only Japanese-market model with a naturally aspirated engine, was the 300ZR. It continued to be marketed as a companion fastback to the more formal appearance of the Nissan Skyline-based Nissan Leopard coup√© at Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships. The 200ZR model was introduced in October 1985 and was the first production car in the world to use a ceramic turbocharger. Maximum power output is Net. The 200ZR was offered on both wheelbases and as a slicktop (200ZR-I) or as a T-top (200ZR-II). 1986 model year 200ZR's feature a prominent central hood scoop. This was made much smaller with the October 1986 facelift, which generally made for a smoother appearance overall. With the facelift, claimed power of the turbocharged 300ZX dropped to as Nissan changed from Gross to Net ratings, and the VG20-powered models were discontinued. This was also when the DOHC, naturally aspirated, 300ZR model was added to the lineup, with , making for three differently engined models with nearly the same performance. The 300ZR was positioned as a sportier alternative, with tighter suspension settings, while the turbocharged 300ZX was now only offered with an automatic transmission, and the 200ZR was a budget alternative as it fit into a lower tax and insurance category thanks to its smaller engine. =European models= The European turbo models, as well as those sold in other markets unencumbered by strict emissions regulations, produce due to higher lift and higher duration on the camshaft profile, also known outside of Europe as the Nismo camshafts. The two-seater model was not available in mainland Europe but was available in the United Kingdom.New Model Introduction Product Bulletin, pp. 13, 16 Some models were also equipped without catalytic converters. All European turbocharged models received a different front lower spoiler as well, with 84-86 models being unique and 87-89 production having the same spoiler as the USDM 1988 Shiro Special model. Swedish- and Swiss- market models (as well as those sold in Australia) received exhaust gas recirculation control systems to meet those countries particular emissions regulations.New Model Introduction Product Bulletin, p. 27 =Australian models= All Australian model Z31 300ZXs were 2+2 T-top body, with an engine offering of either the 3.0L V6 N/A VG30E, or the 3.0L V6 Turbo Charged VG30ET. The cars sold in 1984 and '85 were all naturally aspirated with no catalytic converter, while the turbocharged version was the only model available from 1986 to 1988. There was only one trim level in Australia, with the digital dashboard and climate control being an optional upgrade package, and leather seats only available in the redesigned series 3 \\"Californian\\" models. The Australian factory service manual provides camshaft measurements which do not match any of the known USDM or EDM camshaft profiles, the FSM states the exhaust valve has an open duration of 252 degrees, but the specified opening and closing angles add up to 258 degrees. All Australian publication content express that N/A versions possess , along with the turbocharged versions as . The Australian 50th Anniversary Edition was more basic than the U.S. version, the 50th AE was a normal n/a 300ZX with the digital dash package, a black interior, black velour seats, and a 50th AE badge on the exterior. The exterior badge was fixed to the cars by dealerships, so the position of the badge is not the same on all models. There was no Shiro Special in Australia, and no models featured the adjustable shock absorbers. Z32 The Z32 was a new design, approved in final form by Nissan management on October 1, 1986 and designed by Isao Sono and Toshio Yamashita. The body was wider with a rounder profile and fewer hard edges. It had a marginally increased drag coefficient of .31 compared to the Z31's .30. Unchanged from the previous generation 300ZX was the displacement of the VG30 V6 engine, now with DOHC and variable valve timing (N-VCT), producing at 6,400 rpm and at 4,800 rpm in naturally aspirated (NA) form. The twin turbocharged (TT) variant was upgraded with Garrett AiResearch parallel twin-turbochargers and dual intercoolers producing at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 3,600 rpm. The Z32 was the first car to be marketed following the introduction of the power ceiling imposed by JAMA that remained until 2004. Performance varied from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) times of 5.0-6.0 seconds depending on the source, and a governed top speed of . Twin Turbocharged Z32s also featured adjustable two mode suspension and the four- wheel steering systems called \\"Super HICAS\\" (High Capacity Actively Controlled Steering), first introduced on the R31 Nissan Skyline. Nissan utilized the Cray-2 supercomputer to design the new Z32 with a form of CAD software making it one of the first production cars to utilize this tool. Like previous generations, Nissan offered a 4-seater (2+2) model with the Z32. Most Z32s now featured T-tops as standard. A hardtop (Slicktop) model was available in North America, only in Naturally Aspirated guise, and in Japan was available as Naturally Aspirated as well as an extremely rare Twin Turbo model (Japan- only). All ‚ÄúSlicktops‚Äù were 2 seaters (2+0). In 1992, a 2-seat convertible version (produced by ASC) was introduced for the first time, in response to aftermarket conversions. In 1990, Motorsports International of Waco, Texas collaborated with Japanese tuning company HKS to create the SR-71 Z32. The cars were upgraded with larger Garrett turbochargers, HKS electronics and a Kaminari body kit designed for the SR-71 by Pete Brock. The SR-71 was California CARB certified and was to be sold through a select dealer network and Japanese performance tuning shops located within the United States. Officially, a total of eight cars were produced and were numbered #000-#007. But there were others custom-made. The exact number is not known. The SR-71 claimed the title of the third fastest production car in the world in 1990 for a fraction of the price of a Lamborghini Diablo and Ferrari F40 according to the designer Randy Ball. The base price was $65,000 for the Z32 and SR-71 conversion. In 1995 and 1996, Steve Millen Motorsports (Stillen), developed a SMZ model with Nissan North America that were sold throughout the U.S. and Canada through designated Nissan dealerships. The performance upgrades were covered by the factory warranty. Each vehicle was numbered in the engine bay and interior. A total of 104 SMZs were produced at $14,000 more than the standard Nissan Z32 Twin Turbo. American Z-car sales reached one million sales during the 1990 model year, making it at that time the best selling sports car. In America the 300ZX faced the same fate of many Japanese sports cars of the time. While the 1989 300ZX was priced at around $30,000, its final model year price increased to about $50,000. The mid-1990s marketplace trends toward SUVs and the rising Yen:Dollar ratio contributed to the end of North American 300ZX sales in 1996 with over 80,000 in sales. A Commemorative Edition for the final 300 units shipped to America included decals and certificates of authenticity. In the UK & Europe, all Z32s offered were in 2+2 TT form between 1990 and 1996 (1990-1994 for UK). They were sold through dealerships in the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy. In Australia, all Z32s offered were in 2+2 NA form between 1990 to 1995. In Japan, the 300ZX continued until August 2000. The Japanese Domestic Market was offered a number of variants unavailable to the international market such as the \\"Version S\\" (Spec Model), ‚ÄúVersion R‚Äù (Ready Model) and Slicktop Twin Turbo (the most expensive trim option only available in Version S guise). Version S was a base grade specification that includes all necessary road trim and items as standard, such as stereo and A/C. It could be ordered with various options separately. Options were available separately by order only, and include: ‚Ä¢ 2+0 SWB 2-Seater T-Top trim ‚Ä¢ 2+0 SWB 2-Seater solid roof (slicktop) trim ‚Ä¢ 2+2 LWB 4-Seater T-Top trim ‚Ä¢ Automatic Climate Control ‚Ä¢ Cruise Control ‚Ä¢ 8 Way Power Drivers Seat ‚Ä¢ 4 Way Power Passengers Seat ‚Ä¢ Recaro Seats ‚Ä¢ BOSE Audio ‚Ä¢ VG30DE Naturally Aspirated Engine ‚Ä¢ VG30DETT Twin Turbo Engine ‚Ä¢ Super HICAS (only available on TT option) ‚Ä¢ Anti-Lock Brake System ‚Ä¢ Drivers Side Airbag ‚Ä¢ Suede / Tweed / Cloth / Leather Seating ‚Ä¢ All other available ‚ÄúAltia‚Äù options from order guide Version R: Available only on 2+2 LWB 4-Seater with the only major options being in N/A or Twin Turbo configuration, with automatic or manual transmissions, this trim came with preset options from the factory at a reduced (combined) cost, giving customers a ‚Äúready‚Äù model by which to order if they didn‚Äôt feel like ordering options one by one. This presented buyers with an easier choice selection and a ‚Äúbase model‚Äù car by which to settle for. Standard features (for 1998) included: ‚Ä¢ Recaro Seats ‚Ä¢ Sideskirts ‚Ä¢ Rear Spoiler ‚Ä¢ Drivers Side Airbag ‚Ä¢ Cloth Seats ‚Ä¢ Anti-Lock Brakes ‚Ä¢ Xenon HID Headlamps ‚Ä¢ Cruise Control ‚Ä¢ Automatic Climate Control The only options were: ‚Ä¢ Carbon / Marble Interior Trim ‚Ä¢ Audio Equipment Package with EQ. ‚Ä¢ Automatic or Manual Transmission ‚Ä¢ VG30DE or VG30DETT The aforementioned facelift of late 1998 featured a new front fascia, tail lights, optional Xenon HID headlights, optional rear spoiler, optional BBS mesh wheels, orange rear corner lights and an instrument cluster with white dials as well as other minor changes. Early model Z32‚Äôs (made pre-1994) and sold in Japan did not have Exhaust Gas Recirculation systems nor Air Injection Valve systems. All JDM Z32‚Äôs used a front rebar system made out of fiberglass rather than steel (like their American Market counterparts), and also had different exhaust systems with lighter weight Catalytic Converters (with only one set on the JDM Twin Turbo model vs. two sets on the USDM Twin Turbo models). Given the lack of these regulatory items, JDM Z32‚Äôs often weighed 100+lbs (45+kg) less than their American specification counterparts. =Style and evolution= The Z32 chassis underwent some changes during its production run between 1989 and 2000 (Japan) and 1990 to 1996 (US). The Z32's extended model year sales in 1990 reached 39,290 units.

The 60-second commercial was directed by Ridley Scott and only aired once. Executives at Nissan pulled the commercial after the initial airing when they became concerned the commercial would promote street racing since the commercial features the 300ZX being faster than a sport bike, a formula one car and a fighter jet. Another memorable 300ZX commercial is \\"Toys\\" from 1996. Inspired by the film Toy Story, the commercial is set to Van Halen's cover of \\"You Really Got Me\\" and depicts a G. I. Joe-like action figure coming to life, getting behind the wheel of a red 300ZX radio-controlled car and picking up a Barbie-like doll for a date, stealing her away from her husband, who resembles Ken. They then drive around the feet of Mr K, a caricature of former Nissan executive Yutaka Katayama, who smiles as he watches them go by.Remember Nissan‚Äôs Ken and Barbie Toy Ads? Throwback Thursday Toy manufacturer Mattel filed a lawsuit against Nissan in 1997, claiming the ad's use of dolls that resemble G. I. Joe, Barbie and Ken amounted to \\"trademark and copyright infringement\\" and caused \\"irreparable injury to Mattel's name, business reputation and goodwill.\\"Mattel Sues Nissan Over TV Commercial Mattel sought unspecified damages and an injunction that would pull the ad off the air. Nissan defended the ad, claiming that the dolls were named \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Nick\\" and \\"Tad\\" and that they were modeled after celebrities.AFTER AQUA, MATTEL GOES AFTER CAR AD Mattel and Nissan eventually settled the lawsuit out of court and observers noted that the lawsuit ultimately just gave Nissan and the advertisement further exposure and publicity.Throwback Thursday: A Look Back at Nissan‚Äôs 1996 $200 Million Ad Campaign Motorsports Paul Newman's 300ZX won the 1986 Trans Am at Lime Rock for Bob Sharp Racing The 300ZX was campaigned during 1984 and 1985 in showroom stock racing. The car scored a Trans Am win in 1986 at Lime Rock by Paul Newman for Bob Sharp Racing. This would be the only Trans Am win by a 300ZX. From 1985 to 1987, the Electramotive-developed GTP ZX-Turbo was raced in the IMSA GT Championship's GTP class and also the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, badged as a Fairlady Z, using a Lola T810 chassis and a VG30ET engine. Following development through 1987, the car would become dominant in IMSA GT in 1988. Additional factory endorsement, combined with a new chassis, transmission and more reliable Goodyear tires contributed to the team's success. The SOHC VG30ET was making upwards of , with a power band that extended from 4,000 to 9,000 rpm on a single turbo. The Clayton Cunningham Racing 300ZX which won the 1994 24 Hours of Daytona From 1990 to 1995, Steve Millen drove the twin turbo 300ZX for Clayton Cunningham Racing. The car dominated the IMSA in its GTO, then later GTS categories due to its newly designed chassis and engine. Millen would rank as the #1 Factory Driver for Nissan for 7 years and earn two IMSA GTS Driving Championships and two IMSA GTS Manufacturer's Championships. The biggest triumph for the Z32 racecar was the victory in the 1994 24 Hours of Daytona. In the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 300ZX ranked first in the GTS-1 class and 5th overall. In an attempt to level the playing field in the GTS-1 class by reducing the allowable horsepower, the IMSA declared the twin turbo VG engine ineligible for the 1995 season. The 1995 GTS 300ZX car would debut with the V8 Nissan VH engine at Daytona and would place first in the GTS-1 class at the 12 Hours of Sebring and Moosehead Grand Prix in Halifax. The JUN- BLITZ Bonneville Z32 holds the E/BMS class land speed record of 260.87 mph (419.84 km/h) set at the 1995 Bonneville Speed Trial. The vehicle was built as a partnership between JUN Auto and BLITZ. In 1990, JUN's first Z32 went 210.78 mph (339.2 km/h) at their Yatabe test course and hit 231.78 mph (373 km/h) after some tuning at Bonneville.

() (full name: \\"Maccabi Avshalom Ironi Petah Tikva F.C., ) is an Israeli football club based in the city of Petah Tikva. It is part of the Maccabi sports club. The team promoted to first division at 2019/20 after only one season in second division (Liga Leumit). History The club was founded in 1912 by a group of Jewish students from Petah Tikva, who were studying in the Ottoman city of Constantinople (many of them would later serve in the Ottoman army during World War I), making it the second oldest Jewish football club in Israel after Maccabi Tel Aviv, which was formed in 1906.Maccabi Petah Tikva: From 1908 to Today Asher Goldberg, m-pt.co.il In 1921, after the death of founder member Avshalom Gisin during the 1921 Palestine riots, the club added his name to the club's name, and the club was named \\"Maccabi Avshalom Petah Tikva\\".Maccabi Avshalom Do'ar HaYom, 26 June 1928, Historical Jewish Press In 1927 the club moved to the Maccabi Petah Tikva Ground, where they would play until the 1970s. In 1935 they won their first piece of silverware, beating Hakoah Tel Aviv 1‚Äì0 in the cup final.Israel ‚Äì List of Cup Finals RSSSF In 1939 they reached the final again, but lost 2‚Äì1 to Hapoel Tel Aviv. The following year they won the Haaretz tournament. The club was included in the new Israeli League in 1949, and finished fifth in the inaugural post-independence league table.Israel ‚Äì List of Final Tables RSSSF In the next season (1951‚Äì52 ‚Äì there was no 1950‚Äì51 edition) they finished as runners-up to champions Maccabi Tel Aviv and also won the State Cup, beating Maccabi Tel Aviv 1‚Äì0. In 1953‚Äì54 (1952‚Äì53 was also not played) they also finished second with Eliezer Spiegel finishing as the league's top goalscorer on 16 goals from 22 matches. After several seasons of mid-table finishes, Maccabi finished bottom of the table in 1962‚Äì63 (a season in which the club were deducted 3 points due to suspicions of bribery during a game with Maccabi Jaffa) and were due to be relegated to Liga Alef. However, the Israel Football Association decided to expand the league from 12 to 15 clubs and they were spared demotion. However, the club was relegated at the end of the 1965‚Äì66 season after finishing second from bottom. After two seasons in Liga Alef (one of which ‚Äì 1966‚Äì68 Liga Leumit ‚Äì lasted for two years) the club returned to the top division in 1969. At the end of the 1970‚Äì71 season the club was relegated again after finishing second from bottom, but made an immediate return as Liga Alef champions. Although Maccabi finished bottom in 1974‚Äì75, they were again reprieved from relegation due to league expansion. However, after a repeat performance in 1976‚Äì77 they did go down. After making another immediate return to the top flight, the club maintained several mid-table finishes, before ending the 1987‚Äì88 season bottom of the table. In 1990 and 1991 the club won the Liga Artzit Toto Cup. They returned to the top division in 1991 and have remained there since. In 1995 the club won the top division's Toto Cup for the first time, a feat repeated in 2000 and 2004. In 2001 the club reached the cup final for the first time in 49 years, losing 3‚Äì0 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 2003‚Äì04 they finished third, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. However, the home leg of their third qualifying round tie against SC Heerenveen was cancelled by UEFA due to a baggage handlers strike,Uefa make U-turn BBC Sport, 22 September 2004 and they lost the away leg 5‚Äì0.

He was known for three decades as the embodiment of the debonair man-about-town in the tradition of George Grossmith Jr., and was described by The Times as \\"the last of the knuts.\\" He is best known in America for his role in the classic Hollywood musical The Band Wagon in 1953. Biography Buchanan was born in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the son of Walter John Buchanan Sr (1865‚Äì1902), auctioneer, and his wife, Patricia, n√©e McWatt (1860‚Äì1936).Spicer, Andrew H: \\"Buchanan, Walter John (1890‚Äì1957)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, January 2008. Retrieved 3 November 2008 He was educated at the Glasgow Academy. =Early career= After a brief attempt to follow his late father's profession and a failure at acting in Glasgow, he moved to London and became a music hall comedian under the name of Chump Buchanan and first appeared on the West End in September 1912 in the comic opera The Grass Widow at the Apollo Theatre. Hardship dogged him for a while before he became famous whilst on tour in 1915 in Tonight's the Night. He produced and acted in his own plays both in London and New York City. Buchanan's health was not robust, and, to his bitter regret, he was declared unfit for military service in the First World War. He appeared with some success in West End shows during the war, attracting favourable notices as a \\"knut\\"defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \\"a fashionable or showy young man\\" in the mould of George Grossmith Jr, and achieved front rank stardom in Andr√© Charlot's 1921 revue A to Z, appearing with Gertrude Lawrence. Among his numbers in the show was Ivor Novello's \\"And Her Mother Came Too\\", which became Buchanan's signature song. The show transferred successfully to Broadway in 1924. For the rest of the 1920s and 1930s he was famous for \\"the seemingly lazy but most accomplished grace with which he sang, danced, flirted and joked his way through musical shows.... The tall figure, the elegant gestures, the friendly drawling voice, the general air of having a good time.\\"The Times: \\"Last of the knuts\\", 21 October 1957, p. 12 During the Second World War he starred in his own musical production It's Time to Dance, whose cast included Fred Emney. The musical show was based on a book by Douglas Furber and L. Arthur Rose, and was staged at the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, London. =Film career and later years= He made his film debut in the silent cinema, in 1917 and appeared in about three dozen films in his career. In 1938, Buchanan achieved the unusual feat of starring in the London stage musical This'll Make You Whistle while concurrently filming a film version. The film was released while the stage version was still running; thus the two productions competed with each other. Other starring roles included Monte Carlo (1930), Smash and Grab (1937) and The Gang's All Here (1939). He also produced several films including Happidrome (1943) and The Sky's the Limit (1938), which he also directed. He continued to work on Broadway and the West End and took roles in several Hollywood musicals, including The Band Wagon (1953), his best-known film, in which he plays camp theatre director Jeffrey Cordova opposite Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. He suffered from spinal arthritis, though this did not stop him from performing several dance numbers with Astaire in Band Wagon. British stage career Buchanan's British stage appearances included A to Z, Battling Butler, Toni, Sunny, That's a Good Girl, Stand up and Sing, Mr Whittington, This'll Make You Whistle, Top Hat and Tails, The Last of Mrs Cheyney, Fine Feathers, Canaries Sometimes Sing, Don't Listen, Ladies!, Castle in the Air, King's Rhapsody and As Long as They're Happy. His first pantomime appearance (Christmas, 1940) was as \\"Buttons\\" in Cinderella. His productions included The Women, The Body was Well Nourished, Waltz Without End, It's Time to Dance, A Murder for a Valentine, Treble Trouble and The Lady Asks for Help. American stage career Buchanan's American stage appearances included: Andr√© Charlot's Revues, Charles B. Cochran's Wake Up and Dream, Pardon My English, Between the Devil and Harvey (1948). Film career Buchanan's Hollywood films included Paris, The Show of Shows (1929), Monte Carlo (1930) and The Band Wagon (1953). His British films included Yes, Mr Brown (1933), Goodnight, Vienna (1932), That's a Good Girl (1933), Brewster's Millions (1935), Come Out of the Pantry (1935), When Knights Were Bold (1936), This'll Make You Whistle (1936), Smash and Grab (1937), The Sky's the Limit (1938), Break the News (1938), The Gang's All Here (1939), The Middle Watch (1940), Bulldog Sees It Through (1940), As Long as They're Happy (1955) and Josephine and Men (1955). He made one French film (bilingual), The Diary of Major Thompson (1955). Radio and television Buchanan was a frequent broadcaster on British radio, especially during the Second World War. Programmes included The Jack Buchanan Show and, in 1955, the hugely popular eight-part series Man About Town. On 12 June 1928, Buchanan participated in the first-ever outside television broadcast, conducted by John Logie Baird. Television appearances in the USA included Max Liebman's Spotlight in 1954 and The Ed Sullivan Show. Business interests In a British tradition of actor-management, Buchanan frequently produced his own shows, many of which were premiered in the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow.\\"Alhambra Glasgow\\" by Graeme Smith He was also heavily involved in the more commercial side of British show-business. He was responsible, with partners, for the building and ownership of the Leicester Square Theatre, London, and the Imperial in Brighton. He also controlled the Garrick Theatre in the West End of London and the King's Theatre in Hammersmith. Jack Buchanan Productions (in which his partners were J. Arthur Rank and Charles Woolf) owned Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. He had been at school with the pioneer of television John Logie Baird and with him co-owned Television Limited, which manufactured and rented televisions. Not all his business ventures were profitable, and at his death his estate was valued for probate (in 1958) at ¬£24,489 (equivalent to ¬£ today). Marriage Buchanan's image was that of the raffish eternal bachelor, but he was, unknown to most, married to Saffo Arnau in 1915. She was a singer. This marriage was annulled in 1920. Later in life, he married Susan Bassett, an American, in 1947; he was her second husband. Through her he had a stepdaughter, Theo, who lived with him and his wife. He had no children of his own. He had previously had a relationship with Australian actress Coral Browne, and during her meeting in Moscow with Soviet spy Guy Burgess in the late 1950s she informed Burgess, on mentioning Buchanan, that \\"we almost got married'. \\"And...?\\" \\"He jilted me.\\" Burgess, previously at the British Foreign Office, had defected to Moscow a few years earlier, and one of the few mementoes of his earlier life that he had been able to keep was one 78rpm Jack Buchanan record‚Äî\\"Who?\\"‚Äîwhich, when Browne visited his Moscow flat, he played repeatedly. This event is portrayed in Alan Bennett's play An Englishman Abroad. Character Buchanan was noted for his portrayals of the quintessential English gentleman, despite being a Scot. He was known for his financial generosity to less prosperous actors and chorus performers. Sandy Wilson recalled that each year during the running of the annual Grand National horse race, Buchanan would cancel that day's performance of his current musical and charter an excursion train to the racecourse and back, supplying meals for the entire cast and crew of his show, in addition to giving them ¬£5 each for a \\"flutter\\" on the horse of their choice. Buchanan died in London in 1957 from spinal cancer at age 66.

The Monuments to the Warsaw Uprising were first established in Warsaw in the 1970s. Prior to that, there were only monuments to the Red Army soldiers and the Armia Ludowa soldiers. The role of the latter in the city fights in 1944 was exaggerated and overrated. Most of the victims of the Uprising who were buried in graves all over the city were later exhumed and buried in mass graves far away from the city centre, with a small concrete monument to \\"the victims of the war with Nazism\\". No mention of the Uprising was allowed. Despite communist efforts, the people of Warsaw did not forget the Uprising. The only way to express it was on Polish zaduszki day, when thousands of people lit candles on graves of the Armia Krajowa soldiers in PowƒÖzki cemetery. According to the Polish secret police, in 1983 more than 400,000 people attended the informal feast. In 1979, the first (unofficial) celebration of Warsaw Uprising anniversary took place. By the 1970s, some monuments were put up which even mentioned the uprising by name, but not that the Home army had fought in it. Only in the 1990s were monuments with full details of the fighting permitted. In the 1970s, the Polish United Workers' Party under the lead of Edward Gierek started to seek a \\"Polish way to socialism\\" and allowed for some liberalization of Polish history. The official propaganda started to underline that although the commanders of the Armia Krajowa were criminals, the individual soldiers simply followed wrong orders. In Warsaw, some 500 stone tablets were erected to commemorate those who fell in the city during the war. The tablets were all identical, except for the dates and number of victims. The text under the monuments says: This place is sanctified with the blood of Poles who fell in fight for the freedom of the Motherland. Still no mention of the Uprising was allowed in public places. Warsaw Uprising Monument Also, a monument to the engineers of the Soviet- backed 1st Polish Army who crossed the river in late September and tried to help the Uprising was erected in Powi≈õle area. However, there was no text explaining when or what for did they die. The text written on the tables around the statue of an engineer said The Free Warsaw will never forget those who started the great effort of its reconstruction (...) to the engineers who lost their lives on duty.. In 1980, the start of the Solidarity movement allowed for a committee to be created, whose purpose was to erect a monument of the Warsaw Uprising. The money was to be gathered from private sponsors since the party still did not want to participate in such an initiative. Many prominent members of the Solidarity joined the committee, but it was banned after the Martial Law was imposed in 1981. However, the communist authorities understood that the memory of the Uprising will not fade in peoples' minds and agreed to prepare a project of the monument. On July 20, 1984, an erection act was prepared. The date was chosen to blur the connection with the uprising and the feast was officially connected to July 22, the anniversary of signing the PKWN manifesto. No Armia Krajowa members were invited and the construction never started. At the start of the 21st century, monuments to those insurrectionists killed by the NKVD and Polish Communists at the end of the war are being put in place After the peaceful dissolution of communist system in Poland in 1989, the committee was recreated. The project by Jacek Budyna was already prepared and construction begun immediately. The Warsaw Uprising Monument (Pomnik Powstania Warszawskiego) was erected on Krasi≈Ñski Square, close to the place where one of the sewer communication lines with Star√≥wka, ≈ªoliborz and the city centre was located. The monument was revealed on August 1, 1989. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the monuments to the soldiers who fought in the battle were no longer banned and started to spread throughout the city. Nowadays every battalion who took part in the struggle has got a monument, a street or a square named after.

The conjugate of z is . Since , the product of a number z with its conjugate is , an isotropic quadratic form, . The collection D of all split complex numbers for forms an algebra over the field of real numbers. Two split-complex numbers w and z have a product wz that satisfies . This composition of N over the algebra product makes a composition algebra. A similar algebra based on R2 and component-wise operations of addition and multiplication, , where xy is the quadratic form on R2, also forms a quadratic space. The ring isomorphism :\\\\begin{align} D &\\\\to \\\\R^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x + yj &\\\\mapsto (x + y, x - y) \\\\end{align} relates proportional quadratic forms, but the mapping is an isometry since the multiplicative identity (1, 1) of R2 is at a distance from 0, which is normalized in D. Split-complex numbers have many other names; see ' below. See the article Motor variable for functions of a split-complex number. Definition A split-complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers, written in the form :z = x + jy where x and y are real numbers and the quantity j satisfies :j^2 = +1 Choosing j^2 = -1 results in the complex numbers. It is this sign change which distinguishes the split-complex numbers from the ordinary complex ones. The quantity j here is not a real number but an independent quantity. The collection of all such z is called the split- complex plane. Addition and multiplication of split-complex numbers are defined by :\\\\begin{align} (x + jy) + (u + jv) &= (x + u) + j(y + v) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (x + jy)(u + jv) &= (xu + yv) + j(xv + yu). \\\\end{align} This multiplication is commutative, associative and distributes over addition. =Conjugate, modulus, and bilinear form= Just as for complex numbers, one can define the notion of a split-complex conjugate. If :z = x + jy the conjugate of z is defined as :z^* = x - jy. The conjugate satisfies similar properties to usual complex conjugate. Namely, :\\\\begin{align} (z + w)^* &= z^* + w^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ (zw)^* &= z^* w^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(z^*\\\\right)^* &= z. \\\\end{align} These three properties imply that the split-complex conjugate is an automorphism of order 2. The modulus of a split- complex number is given by the isotropic quadratic form : \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert = z z^* = z^* z = x^2 - y^2 . It has the composition algebra property: : \\\\lVert z w \\\\rVert = \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert \\\\lVert w \\\\rVert . However, this quadratic form is not positive-definite but rather has signature , so the modulus is not a norm. The associated bilinear form is given by :\\\\langle z, w \\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left(zw^*\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left(z^* w\\\\right) = xu - yv, where and . Another expression for the modulus is then : \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert = \\\\langle z, z \\\\rangle . Since it is not positive-definite, this bilinear form is not an inner product; nevertheless the bilinear form is frequently referred to as an indefinite inner product. A similar abuse of language refers to the modulus as a norm. A split-complex number is invertible if and only if its modulus is nonzero (\\\\lVert z \\\\rVert e 0), thus x ¬± j x have no inverse. The multiplicative inverse of an invertible element is given by : z^{-1} = \\\\frac{z^*}{\\\\lVert z \\\\rVert}. Split-complex numbers which are not invertible are called null vectors. These are all of the form for some real number a. =The diagonal basis= There are two nontrivial idempotent elements given by and . Recall that idempotent means that and . Both of these elements are null: : \\\\lVert e \\\\rVert = \\\\lVert e^* \\\\rVert = e^* e = 0 . It is often convenient to use e and e‚àó as an alternate basis for the split-complex plane. This basis is called the diagonal basis or null basis. The split- complex number z can be written in the null basis as :z = x + jy = (x - y)e + (x + y)e^*. If we denote the number for real numbers a and b by , then split- complex multiplication is given by :\\\\left(a_1, b_1\\\\right)\\\\left(a_2, b_2\\\\right) = \\\\left(a_1 a_2, b_1 b_2)\\\\right. In this basis, it becomes clear that the split-complex numbers are ring-isomorphic to the direct sum with addition and multiplication defined pairwise. The split-complex conjugate in the diagonal basis is given by :(a, b)^* = (b, a) and the modulus by :\\\\lVert (a, b) \\\\rVert = ab. Though lying in the same isomorphism class in the category of rings, the split-complex plane and the direct sum of two real lines differ in their layout in the Cartesian plane. The isomorphism, as a planar mapping, consists of a counter-clockwise rotation by 45¬∞ and a dilation by . The dilation in particular has sometimes caused confusion in connection with areas of a hyperbolic sector. Indeed, hyperbolic angle corresponds to area of a sector in the plane with its \\"unit circle\\" given by . The contracted \\"unit circle\\" of the split-complex plane has only half the area in the span of a corresponding hyperbolic sector. Such confusion may be perpetuated when the geometry of the split-complex plane is not distinguished from that of . Geometry Unit hyperbola with , conjugate hyperbola with , and asymptotes . A two-dimensional real vector space with the Minkowski inner product is called -dimensional Minkowski space, often denoted R1,1. Just as much of the geometry of the Euclidean plane R2 can be described with complex numbers, the geometry of the Minkowski plane R1,1 can be described with split- complex numbers. The set of points :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z : \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert = a^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a hyperbola for every nonzero a in R. The hyperbola consists of a right and left branch passing through and . The case is called the unit hyperbola. The conjugate hyperbola is given by :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z : \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert = -a^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} with an upper and lower branch passing through and . The hyperbola and conjugate hyperbola are separated by two diagonal asymptotes which form the set of null elements: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z : \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert = 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. These two lines (sometimes called the null cone) are perpendicular in R2 and have slopes ¬±1. Split-complex numbers z and w are said to be hyperbolic-orthogonal if . While analogous to ordinary orthogonality, particularly as it is known with ordinary complex number arithmetic, this condition is more subtle. It forms the basis for the simultaneous hyperplane concept in spacetime. The analogue of Euler's formula for the split-complex numbers is :\\\\exp(j\\\\theta) = \\\\cosh(\\\\theta) + j\\\\sinh(\\\\theta).\\\\, This can be derived from a power series expansion using the fact that cosh has only even powers while that for sinh has odd powers. For all real values of the hyperbolic angle Œ∏ the split-complex number has norm 1 and lies on the right branch of the unit hyperbola. Numbers such as Œª have been called hyperbolic versors. Since Œª has modulus 1, multiplying any split-complex number z by Œª preserves the modulus of z and represents a hyperbolic rotation (also called a Lorentz boost or a squeeze mapping). Multiplying by Œª preserves the geometric structure, taking hyperbolas to themselves and the null cone to itself. The set of all transformations of the split-complex plane which preserve the modulus (or equivalently, the inner product) forms a group called the generalized orthogonal group . This group consists of the hyperbolic rotations, which form a subgroup denoted , combined with four discrete reflections given by :z \\\\mapsto \\\\pm z and z \\\\mapsto \\\\pm z^*. The exponential map :\\\\exp\\\\colon(\\\\mathbb{R}, +) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{SO}^{+}(1, 1) sending Œ∏ to rotation by exp(jŒ∏) is a group isomorphism since the usual exponential formula applies: :e^{j(\\\\theta + \\\\phi)} = e^{j\\\\theta}e^{j\\\\phi}.\\\\, If a split-complex number z does not lie on one of the diagonals, then z has a polar decomposition. Algebraic properties In abstract algebra terms, the split-complex numbers can be described as the quotient of the polynomial ring R[x] by the ideal generated by the polynomial , :R[x]/(x2 ‚àí 1). The image of x in the quotient is the \\"imaginary\\" unit j. With this description, it is clear that the split- complex numbers form a commutative ring with characteristic 0. Moreover, if we define scalar multiplication in the obvious manner, the split-complex numbers form a commutative and associative algebra of dimension two over the reals. The algebra is not a division algebra or field since the null elements are not invertible. All of the nonzero null elements are zero divisors. Since addition and multiplication are continuous operations with respect to the usual topology of the plane, the split-complex numbers form a topological ring. The algebra of split-complex numbers forms a composition algebra since :\\\\lVert zw \\\\rVert = \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert \\\\lVert w \\\\rVert for any numbers z and w. From the definition it is apparent that the ring of split-complex numbers is isomorphic to the group ring R[C2] of the cyclic group C2 over the real numbers R. Matrix representations One can easily represent split-complex numbers by matrices. The split-complex number :z = x + jy can be represented by the matrix :z \\\\mapsto \\\\begin{pmatrix}x & y \\\\\\\\\\\\ y & x\\\\end{pmatrix}. Addition and multiplication of split-complex numbers are then given by matrix addition and multiplication. The modulus of z is given by the determinant of the corresponding matrix. In this representation, split-complex conjugation corresponds to multiplying on both sides by the matrix :C = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1\\\\end{pmatrix}. For any real number a, a hyperbolic rotation by a hyperbolic angle a corresponds to multiplication by the matrix :\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\cosh a & \\\\sinh a \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sinh a & \\\\cosh a\\\\end{pmatrix}. This commutative diagram relates the action of the hyperbolic versor on D to squeeze mapping œÉ applied to R2 The diagonal basis for the split-complex number plane can be invoked by using an ordered pair for z = x + jy and making the mapping :(u, v) = (x, y) \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\1 & -1\\\\end{pmatrix} = (x, y) S. Now the quadratic form is uv = (x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2. Furthermore, :(\\\\cosh a, \\\\sinh a)\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\1 & -1\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\left(e^a, e^{-a}\\\\right) so the two parametrized hyperbolas are brought into correspondence with S. The action of hyperbolic versor e^{bj} \\\\\\\\! then corresponds under this linear transformation to a squeeze mapping :\\\\sigma: (u, v) \\\\mapsto \\\\left(ru, \\\\frac{v}{r}\\\\right),\\\\quad r = e^b. Note that in the context of 2 √ó 2 real matrices there are in fact a great number of different representations of split-complex numbers. The above diagonal representation represents the Jordan canonical form of the matrix representation of the split-complex numbers. For a split-complex number given by the following matrix representation: :Z = \\\\begin{pmatrix}x & y \\\\\\\\\\\\ y & x\\\\end{pmatrix} its Jordan canonical form is given by: :J_z = \\\\begin{pmatrix}x + y & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x - y\\\\end{pmatrix} , where Z = SJ_z S^{-1}\\\\ , and :S = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} . History The use of split-complex numbers dates back to 1848 when James Cockle revealed his tessarines.James Cockle (1849) On a New Imaginary in Algebra 34:37‚Äì47, London-Edinburgh-Dublin Philosophical Magazine (3) 33:435‚Äì9, link from Biodiversity Heritage Library. William Kingdon Clifford used split-complex numbers to represent sums of spins. Clifford introduced the use of split-complex numbers as coefficients in a quaternion algebra now called split-biquaternions. He called its elements \\"motors\\", a term in parallel with the \\"rotor\\" action of an ordinary complex number taken from the circle group. Extending the analogy, functions of a motor variable contrast to functions of an ordinary complex variable. Since the late twentieth century, the split-complex multiplication has commonly been seen as a Lorentz boost of a spacetime plane.Francesco Antonuccio (1994) Semi-complex analysis and mathematical physicsF.

In that model, the number represents an event in a spacio-temporal plane, where x is measured in nanoseconds and y in Mermin's feet. The future corresponds to the quadrant of events which has the split-complex polar decomposition z = \\\\rho e^{aj} \\\\\\\\!. The model says that z can be reached from the origin by entering a frame of reference of rapidity a and waiting œÅ nanoseconds. The split-complex equation :e^{aj} \\\\ e^{bj} = e^{(a + b)j} expressing products on the unit hyperbola illustrates the additivity of rapidities for collinear velocities. Simultaneity of events depends on rapidity a; :\\\\lbrace z = \\\\sigma j e^{aj} : \\\\sigma \\\\isin \\\\R \\\\rbrace is the line of events simultaneous with the origin in the frame of reference with rapidity a. Two events z and w are hyperbolic-orthogonal when . Canonical events exp(aj) and are hyperbolic orthogonal and lie on the axes of a frame of reference in which the events simultaneous with the origin are proportional to . In 1933 Max Zorn was using the split-octonions and noted the composition algebra property. He realized that the Cayley‚ÄìDickson construction, used to generate division algebras, could be modified (with a factor gamma (Œ≥)) to construct other composition algebras including the split-octonions. His innovation was perpetuated by Adrian Albert, Richard D. Schafer, and others.Robert B. Brown (1967)On Generalized Cayley-Dickson Algebras, Pacific Journal of Mathematics 20(3):415‚Äì22, link from Project Euclid. The gamma factor, with ‚Ñù as base field, builds split-complex numbers as a composition algebra. Reviewing Albert for Mathematical Reviews, N. H. McCoy wrote that there was an \\"introduction of some new algebras of order 2e over F generalizing Cayley‚ÄìDickson algebras.\\"N.H. McCoy (1942) Review of \\"Quadratic forms permitting composition\\" by A.A. Albert, Mathematical Reviews #0006140 Taking and corresponds to the algebra of this article. In 1935 J.C. Vignaux and A.

Lehmer reviewed the article in Mathematical Reviews and observed that this second system was isomorphic to the \\"hyperbolic complex\\" numbers, the subject of this article. In 1961 Warmus continued his exposition, referring to the components of an approximate number as midpoint and radius of the interval denoted.

The company was founded in 1988 and has its headquarters in Aachen, Germany. MAGMA's product and service portfolio includes simulation software MAGMASOFT, with the newest release MAGMA5, as well as engineering services for casting design and optimisation. The software is used world-wide by foundries, casting buyers and designers, especially for the optimization of cast components in automotive and heavy industry applications. German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung cites MAGMA amongst the global market leaders for simulation software for casting processes.[S√ºddeutsche Zeitung]. Ausgabe vom 26.11.2009. Worldwide, MAGMA employs more than 200 people in software development, support, marketing, and administration, of which 90 are in Aachen. The company also has offices and subsidiaries in the United States, Singapore, Brazil, Korea, Turkey, India, China, and the Czech Republic. MAGMA5 MAGMA5 is the standard solution for the simulation of casting processes. The software stands for the prediction of the entire casting component quality and process chain by providing a better understanding of mold filling, solidification and cooling and allows the quantitative prediction of mechanical properties, thermal stresses and distortions of the resulting castings. Simulation accurately describes a cast component's quality up-front before production starts and the casting methoding can be designed with respect to the required component properties. This not only results in a reduction in pre-production sampling as the precise layout of the complete casting system leads to energy, material, and tooling savings. MAGMA5 consists of a base module and a set of additional modules that cover all steps of the casting production. The range of application of MAGMA solutions comprises all cast alloys, from cast iron to aluminum sand casting, permanent mold and die casting up to large steel castings. The software supports the user in the modeling of the component, the determination of melting practice and casting methoding through to model and mold making, heat treatment, and finishing. This saves costs consequently along the entire manufacturing route.

From the last years of the 15th century, its Renaissance spread around Europe. Called the Northern Renaissance because it occurred north of the Italian Renaissance, this period became the German, French, English, Low Countries, Polish Renaissances and in turn other national and localized movements, each with different attributes. In France, King Francis I imported Italian art, commissioned Italian artists (including Leonardo da Vinci), and built grand palaces at great expense, starting the French Renaissance. Trade and commerce in cities like Bruges in the 15th century and Antwerp in the 16th increased cultural exchange between Italy and the Low Countries, however in art, and especially architecture, late Gothic influences remained present until the arrival of Baroque even as painters increasingly drew on Italian models. Universities and the printed book helped spread the spirit of the age through France, the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire, and then to Scandinavia and finally Britain by the late 16th century. Writers and humanists such as Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard and Desiderius Erasmus were greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance model and were part of the same intellectual movement. During the English Renaissance (which overlapped with the Elizabethan era) writers such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe composed works of lasting influence. The Renaissance was brought to Poland directly from Italy by artists from Florence and the Low Countries, starting the Polish Renaissance. In some areas the Northern Renaissance was distinct from the Italian Renaissance in its centralization of political power. While Italy and Germany were dominated by independent city-states, most of Europe began emerging as nation-states or even unions of countries. The Northern Renaissance was also closely linked to the Protestant Reformation with the resulting long series of internal and external conflicts between various Protestant groups and the Roman Catholic Church having lasting effects. Overview Feudalism had dominated Europe for a thousand years, but was on the decline at the beginning of the Renaissance. The reasons for this decline include the post-Plague environment, the increasing use of money rather than land as a medium of exchange, the growing number of serfs living as freemen, the formation of nation-states with monarchies interested in reducing the power of feudal lords, the increasing uselessness of feudal armies in the face of new military technology (such as gunpowder), and a general increase in agricultural productivity due to improving farming technology and methods. As in Italy, the decline of feudalism opened the way for the cultural, social, and economic changes associated with the Renaissance in Europe. Reproduction of Johannes Gutenberg-era Press on display at the Printing History Museum in Lyon, France. Finally, the Renaissance in Europe would also be kindled by a weakening of the Roman Catholic Church. The slow demise of feudalism also weakened a long-established policy in which church officials helped keep the population of the manor under control in return for tribute. Consequently, the early 15th century saw the rise of many secular institutions and beliefs. Among the most significant of these, Renaissance humanism would lay the philosophical grounds for much of Renaissance art, music, science and technology. Erasmus, for example, was important in spreading humanist ideas in the north, and was a central figure at the intersection of classical humanism and mounting religious questions. Forms of artistic expression which a century ago would have been banned by the church were now tolerated or even encouraged in certain circles. The velocity of transmission of the Renaissance throughout Europe can also be ascribed to the invention of the printing press. Its power to disseminate information enhanced scientific research, spread political ideas and generally impacted the course of the Renaissance in northern Europe. As in Italy, the printing press increased the availability of books written in both vernacular languages and the publication of new and ancient classical texts in Greek and Latin. Furthermore, the Bible became widely available in translation, a factor often attributed to the spread of the Protestant Reformation. Age of Discovery One of the most important technological development of the Renaissance was the invention of the caravel. This combination of European and North African ship building technologies for the first time made extensive trade and travel over the Atlantic feasible. While first introduced by the Italian states and the early captains, such as Giovanni Caboto, Giovanni da Verrazzano and Columbus, who were Italian explorers, the development would end Northern Italy's role as the trade crossroads of Europe, shifting wealth and power westwards to Spain, Portugal, France, England, and the Netherlands. These states all began to conduct extensive trade with Africa and Asia, and in the Americas began extensive colonisation activities. This period of exploration and expansion has become known as the Age of Discovery. Eventually European power spread around the globe. Art The Ghent Altarpiece (interior view) by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, painted 1432. Saint Bavo Cathedral, Ghent, Belgium. Early Netherlandish painting often included complicated iconography, and art historians have debated the \\"hidden symbolism\\" of works by artists like Hubert and Jan van Eyck. The detailed realism of Early Netherlandish painting, led by Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and 1430s, is today generally considered to be the beginning of the early Northern Renaissance in painting. This detailed realism was greatly respected in Italy, but there was little reciprocal influence on the North until nearly the end of the 15th century. Although the notion of a north to south-only direction of influence arose in the scholarship of Max Jakob Friedl√§nder and was continued by Erwin Panofsky, art historians are increasingly questioning its validity: Lisa Deam, \\"Flemish versus Netherlandish: A Discourse of Nationalism,\\" in Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 1 (Spring, 1998), pp. 28‚Äì29. Despite frequent cultural and artistic exchange, the Antwerp Mannerists (1500‚Äì1530)‚Äîchronologically overlapping with but unrelated to Italian Mannerism‚Äîwere among the first artists in the Low Countries to clearly reflect Italian formal developments. Around the same time, Albrecht D√ºrer made his two trips to Italy, where he was greatly admired for his prints. D√ºrer, in turn, was influenced by the art he saw there and is agreed to be one of the first Northern High Renaissance painters. Other notable northern painters such as Hans Holbein the Elder and Jean Fouquet, retained a Gothic influence that was still popular in the north, while highly individualistic artists such as Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder developed styles that were imitated by many subsequent generations. Later in the 16th century Northern painters increasingly looked and travelled to Rome, becoming known as the Romanists. The High Renaissance art of Michelangelo and Raphael and the late Renaissance stylistic tendencies of Mannerism that were in vogue had a great impact on their work. Renaissance humanism and the large number of surviving classical artworks and monuments encouraged many Italian painters to explore Greco-Roman themes more prominently than northern artists, and likewise the famous 15th-century German and Dutch paintings tend to be religious. In the 16th century, mythological and other themes from history became more uniform amongst northern and Italian artists. Northern Renaissance painters, however, had new subject matter, such as landscape and genre painting. As Renaissance art styles moved through northern Europe, they changed and were adapted to local customs. In England and the northern Netherlands the Reformation brought religious painting almost completely to an end. Despite several very talented artists of the Tudor Court in England, portrait painting was slow to spread from the elite. In France the School of Fontainebleau was begun by Italians such as Rosso Fiorentino in the latest Mannerist style, but succeeded in establishing a durable national style. By the end of the 16th century, artists such as Karel van Mander and Hendrik Goltzius collected in Haarlem in a brief but intense phase of Northern Mannerism that also spread to Flanders.

Didelphodon (from [is] \\"opossum\\" plus \\"tooth\\") is a genus of stagodont metatherians from the Late Cretaceous of North America. Description Skull cast of Didelphodon in the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, CO; collected in Harding County, SD. Although perhaps little larger than a Virginia opossum, with a maximum skull length of and a weight of , Didelphodon was a large mammal by Mesozoic standards. The teeth have specialized bladelike cusps and carnassial notches, indicating that the animal was a predator; the jaws are short and massive and bear enormous, bulbous premolar teeth which appear to have been used for crushing. Analyses of a near-complete skull referred to Didelphodon show that it had an unusually high bite force quotient (i.e. bite force relative to body size) among Mesozoic mammals, suggesting a durophagous diet. However, its skull lacks the vaulted forehead of hyenas and other specialized bone-eating durophagous mammals, indicating that its diet was perhaps a mixture of hard foodstuffs (e.g. snails, bones) alongside small vertebrates and carrion; although omnivorous habits were suggested in the past, it appears that it was incapable of processing plant matter, rendering it more likely to be hypercarnivorous or durophagous. Some convergence with the carnassials of other predatory mammal groups has also been noted. Discovery A cast of the first Didelphodon mandible, assigned to D. vorax, to be discovered still containing teeth, now located in the permanent collection of The Children‚Äôs Museum of Indianapolis Molars Three species of Didelphodon are known: D. vorax, D. padanicus, and D. coyi. The genus is known from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and the Lance Formation of Wyoming, the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, and the Scollard Formation of Alberta, where it is one of the most abundant mammals. It is found solely in late Maastrichtian deposits. Classification Didelphodon is a stagodontid marsupial related to Eodelphis and Pariadens. The genus appears to descend from the Campanian Eodelphis, and in particular appears to be related to Eodelphis cutleri. Pariadens appears to be more primitive than either Eodelphis or Didelphodon, and is probably sister to their group. Didelphimorphia is an order that was named in 1872 by Gill. Previously, in 1821, Gray named the superfamily Didelphoidea to house the families Alphadontidae, Pediomyidae, Peradectidae, and Stagodontidae, which unites Didelphodon with many other genera. In 2006, a study found that the stagodontids only contained two taxa, Didelphodon and Eodelphis. The previously-included Pariadens was excluded from the group because its type species, P. kirklandi, lacks any of the clade's characteristics; it was reassigned to Marsupialia incertae sedis. Another species, \\"P.\\" mckennai lacks marsupial features, and is probably a therian. Another historical stagodontid, Boreodon, is a nomen dubium. Finally, the purported stagodontid Delphodon is probably a synonym of Pediomys or Alphadon. A 2016 phylogenetic analysis found that Didelphodon and other stagodontids were marsupialiforms. Their relationships within the Marsupialiformes are shown below. Paleobiology Life restoration of Didelphodon vorax Although it has been argued on the basis of the shape of referred tarsal bones that Didelphodon and other stagodontids were semiaquatic due to having flexible feet, these traits may in fact be evidence of increased rigidity in the foot. Nevertheless, a recently-found and as-of-yet undescribed specimen, located just away from a Triceratops in a riverbed, suggests that Didelphodon may have possessed an otter-like body with a tasmanian devil-like skull. A study that is being prepared by Kraig Derstler, Greg Wilson, Robert Bakker, Ray Vodden and Mike Triebold will describe this new specimen, housed in the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center. A study on Mesozoic mammal locomotion demonstrates that Didelphodon groups with semi-aquatic species.Meng Chen, Gregory Philip Wilson, A multivariate approach to infer locomotor modes in Mesozoic mammals, Article in Paleobiology 41(02) ¬∑ February 2015 DOI: 10.1017/pab.2014.14 The evolution of Didelphodon and other large stagodontids (as well as large deltatheroideans like Nanocuris) occurs after the local extinction of eutriconodont mammals, suggesting passive or direct ecological replacement.G.

A similar status exists under a different name in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Gaining QTS or QTLS An undergraduate degree and successful completion of a teacher training programme is compulsory for QTS recommendation. One of the main routes to achieving QTS, for those already in possession of a degree, involves undertaking a postgraduate teacher training course, such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) or a School Direct programme. The Diploma in Education and Training (DET) leads to QTLS. There are also some undergraduate degree qualifications leading to QTS, such as the Bachelor of Education. In England only, candidates must also pass professional skills tests. All candidates must have GCSEs at grade C or above in English and mathematics, and prospective primary teachers must also be in possession of (usually) a grade C in a science subject before embarking on teacher training. All training which leads to qualified teacher status requires trainees to train across at least two key consecutive pupil age ranges, as defined in the Secretary of State's Requirements for Initial Teacher Training. The age ranges are: *Ages 3‚Äì5 (Early years foundation stage) *Ages 5‚Äì7 (School years 1 and 2) *Ages 7‚Äì9 (School years 3 and 4) *Ages 9‚Äì11 (School years 5 and 6) *Ages 11‚Äì14 (School years 7 to 9) *Ages 14‚Äì16 (School years 10 and 11) *Ages 16‚Äì19 (School years 12 and 13) The Teaching Regulation Agency in England and General Teaching Council for Wales maintain all registrations, as well as issuing QTS certificates. QTS is technically recognised only in the country it was awarded (England or Wales), but teachers can normally apply for QTS in other Home Countries relatively easily. QTS is also recognised by many other countries once the relevant paperwork has been completed, though many countries place a lot of importance on the route to QTS (such as requiring a PGCE, whilst not accepting the GTP). Teachers trained outside England and Wales must also apply to be awarded QTS if they wish to teach in these countries. After having been awarded QTS teachers must normally still pass an induction period (previously called 'probation') - normally their first year of teaching. Teachers who have gained QTS but have not yet completed the Induction period are known as NQTs. NQTs who fail the induction still retain their QTS, but cannot teach in state-run schools. The induction period normally lasts a year (three school terms). Not all European Union qualifications have been officially recognised yet, so one should confirm with one's education establishment as to whether one's qualifications are acceptable, or whether one needs to go through the recognition process. =Routes to QTS or QTLS= Many different qualifications and courses lead to QTS or QTLS: Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) The PGCE is a one-year course for existing degree holders, and the most common postgraduate route into teaching. It is based at and coordinated by a university or other higher education institution, though students spend a large proportion of the course working in placement schools. The PGCE carries credits towards a master's degree. Diploma in Education and Training (DET) The DET is a Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training. It is a one- year 120 credit initial teacher training programme awarded by a university or an awarding body such as Learning Resource Network (LRN). DET graduates are eligible to apply for QTLS from Society for Education and Training. School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) A SCITT programme enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to QTS. Some SCITT programmes also award a PGCE qualification. It is available in England only. Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP)  The GTP enables candidates to gain QTS while they are employed as an unqualified teacher in a school. Both the graduate and registered teacher programmes (GTP and RTP) have been closed in England. The graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been replaced by the School Direct Training Programme (salaried). Undergraduate QTS routes Students can take a three or four-year undergraduate degree course that includes QTS. This enables a candidate to gain their QTS while they study for their degree, with teaching practice being undertaken over the course of the whole programme. These are usually Bachelor of Education (BEd) degrees, though some are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees. Scotland and Northern Ireland QTS as such does not exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland. However, as is the case in England and Wales, all teachers in Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to register with either the General Teaching Council for Scotland or the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland; the General Teaching Councils will consider only graduates with teaching qualifications (such as a BEd, PGCE or PGDE) for registration. In Northern Ireland, a one-year Induction programme (equivalent to the NQT programme in England and Wales) must be completed. In Scotland, a one-year probation period (equivalent to induction in England and Wales) must be completed. Those holding English or Welsh QTS (or an equivalent from another country) must apply for registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. Each case is considered individually; even those with English or Welsh QTS are not guaranteed to be allowed to teach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.  Schools not requiring QTS for teachers  There is no formal requirement for teachers at independent schools to have QTS. As of 27 July 2012, there is no longer any requirement for teaching staff in academies to have QTS.

The Commission was to make recommendations on Israeli involvement in the massacre through an investigation of: Following a four-month investigation, on 8 February 1983, the Kahan Commission submitted its report, which was released to the public by spokesman Bezalel Gordon simultaneously in Hebrew and English. It concluded that \\"direct responsibility\\" rested with the Gemayel Phalangists led by Fadi Frem, and that no Israelis were deemed \\"directly responsible\\", although Israel was held to be \\"indirectly responsible\\". The Defence minister Ariel Sharon was found to bear \\"personal responsibility\\" for \\"ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge\\" and \\"not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed\\". Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a \\"non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defence Minister was charged\\", and it was recommended that Sharon be dismissed as Defence Minister. Initially, Sharon refused to resign, and Prime Minister Menachem Begin refused to fire him. However, following a peace march against the government, as the marchers were dispersing, a grenade was thrown into the crowd, killing Emil Grunzweig, a reserve combat officer and peace activist, and wounding half a dozen others, including the son of the Interior Minister. Although Sharon resigned as Defence Minister, he remained in the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. Years later, Sharon would be elected Israel's Prime Minister. The Commission arrived to similar conclusions with respect to Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Rafael Eitan (\\"tantamount to a breach of duty that was incumbent upon the Chief of Staff\\"), as well as Director of Military Intelligence, Major general Yehoshua Saguy, and other Intelligence officials ‚Äî though the Mossad was not reprimanded and parts of the report commenting on its role remain under military censorship. Critics of the Commission point to its limited scope, some of whom argue it amounted to a whitewash. The final paragraph of the report anticipated such reaction: \\"We do not deceive ourselves that the results of this inquiry will convince or satisfy those who have prejudices or selective consciences, but this inquiry was not intended for such people. We have striven and have spared no effort to arrive at the truth, and we hope that all persons of good will who will examine the issue without prejudice will be convinced that the inquiry was conducted without any bias.\\" Israel's standing in the international community, which had sunk to an all-time low in the wake of the massacre, rebounded following the publication of the report. Israel was praised from many quarters for having investigated itself and punishing senior members of its government.Interior Minister of France Gaston Defferre was quoted saying: \\"This report is the honor of Israel. It gives the world a new lesson in democracy\\". In Italy, the Communist paper L'Unita called the report \\"a turning point for Israel,\\" while Italian Journalist Arrigo Levi remarked in La Stampa: \\"It would be difficult to find any other nation at war that would let itself be subject to such an open and hard self-criticism\\". See \\"The Verdict Is Guilty: An Israeli commission and the Beirut massacre\\", Time (21.2.83). Richard Falk noted that the \\"sincere and careful\\" report was \\"much more devastating in its impact on the evaluation of state leadership during the Lebanon War than any self-scrutiny that the American government allowed during the Vietnam War.\\" Quotes from pp. 319, 320.

Illustration by the Danish Lorenz Fr√∏lich in a 19th-century book. Harald Wartooth or Harold Hiltertooth (Old Norse: Haraldr hildit«´nn; Modern Swedish and Danish: Harald Hildetand; Modern Norwegian: Harald Hildetann; flourished 8th century) was a legendary king of Denmark who is mentioned in several traditional sources. He is held to have (indirectly) succeeded his father as king of Zealand and to have expanded his realm. According to different sources, he may have ruled over Jutland, part of Sweden and the historical northern German province of Wendland. He is said to have been finally defeated and killed at the semi-legendary Battle of Br√•valla. Name Saxo Grammaticus, in Gesta Danorum, gives two different accounts about why Harald had the name wartooth. According to one tradition, it was due to Harald having lost two of his teeth in battle against Veseti, the lord of Scania, after which two new teeth grew out. Saxo further tells that according to another opinion, the name was derived from Harald having protruding teeth.Saxo (1905), p. 456. A scholarly view, however, holds the name to be derived from a name for \\"war hero\\".Andersson (1947), p. 212. Sources Harald Wartooth is stated by most texts to have flourished three generations before the conquest of part of England by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok (860s-870s). This would place him around the late 8th century, though the genealogy linking him with Viking Age rulers is dubious.Nerman (1925), p. 261. However, the sources that mention him are quite late. The most detailed text is Saxo Grammaticus's chronicle Gesta Danorum (c. 1200) which is however complicated by the flow of Danish-patriotic rhetoric, in part a reflection of the Valdemarian age of military expansion. An Icelandic text S√∂gubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum (Fragment of a saga about some ancient kings, 13th century) provides brief details about his life and a fuller account of his dramatic demise. Shorter accounts are found in the Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks (13th century), Lejrekroniken (12th century), The Saga of Herraud and Bose, and others.Nerman (1925), p. 242-57. A lay about the Br√•valla battle, seemingly written by a Norwegian skald in the 11th century, may once existed, forming the basis for the extended saga accounts.Nerman (1925), p. 250-1. By far the oldest reference to Harald is a praise poem by Einarr Helgason from c. 980, where the current Danish ruler Harald Bluetooth is likened with Hilditann, implying that the older Harald was seen as a prestigious forbear of his younger namesake. There is moreover a song in the Poetic Edda, Hyndlulj√≥√∞ (12th century) which describes Harald's descent from Ivar Vidfamne.Herrmann (1922), p. 517-8. Family Most sources describe him as the son of Ivar Vidfamne's daughter Au√∞r the Deep-Minded (but Hervarar saga calls her Alfhild). According to S√∂gubrot, Njal's Saga and the Lay of Hyndla, Harald was the son of Hr≈ìrekr Ringslinger (sl√∂ngvanbaugi), the king of Zealand. S√∂gubrot relates that his mother later married Ra√∞bar√∞r, the king of Gar√∞ar√≠ki and they had the son Randver. However, according to Hervarar saga, both Harald and Randver were the sons of Valdar and Alfhild.Nerman (1925), p. 243-5. Njal's Saga adds that Harald had the son √ûr√°ndr the Old (hinn gamli) who was the ancestor of one of the characters in the saga. S√∂gubrot also mentions that he had a son named √ûr√°ndr the Old (gamli), but also adds a second son, Hr≈ìrekr Ringslinger (sl√∂ngvandbaugi), who apparently was named exactly like his grandfather.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 6 Another son, Eysteinn Illruler is mentioned by Hervarar saga; he later became a king of Sweden.Tolkien & Turville-Petre (1956), p. 68. Landn√°mab√≥k informs that Hr≈ìrekr Ringslinger the younger had a son named √û√≥r√≥lfr (Thorolfur) \\"V√°ganef\\", who in turn had the son V√©mundr Wordplane. V√©mundr was the father of Valgar√∞ur (Valgardur), the father of Hrafn \\"heimski\\" (the Foolish). Hrafn was one of the first settlers in Iceland and settled on the southern coast, in Rang√°rvallas√Ωsla (county of R√°ng√°rvellir). Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum does not mention any Ivar Vidfamne, and gives two different versions of Harald's ancestry. First Saxo writes that Harald was the son of the Scanian chieftain Borkar and a woman named Gro.Saxo (1905), p. 431. Later Saxo has forgotten about this and writes that Harald was the son of Halfdan, Borkar's son, and a woman named Gyrid, the last member of the Skj√∂ldungs.Saxo (1905), p. 455. Claiming his inheritance According to S√∂gubrot, his mother Au√∞r fled to Gar√∞ar√≠ki with her young son when her husband King Hr≈ìrekr was treacherously killed in Zealand by his father-in-law Ivar Vidfamne. She then married the local King Ra√∞bar√∞r, and Harald stayed at his court. When his grandfather Ivar drowned during a punitive expedition against Ra√∞bar√∞r, young Harald traveled to Zealand, where he was accepted as king. Then he went to Scania, which his mother's family had ruled, and was well received and given much help in men and arms. Then he took his fleet to Sweden in order to claim his inheritance. However, many petty kings arrived to reclaim their kingdoms, which Ivar had taken from them. These petty kings thought it would be easy to fight Harald who was only 15 years old. Harald successfully reclaimed his grandfather's domains, so that in the end he owned more than his grandfather had, and there was no king in either Denmark or Sweden who did not pay him tribute or was his vassal. He subjugated all the parts of England that had belonged to Halfdan the Valiant and later Ivar. In England he appointed kings and jarls and had them pay him tribute. He also appointed Hj√∂rmund, the son of Hj√∂rvard Ylfing, the king of √ñsterg√∂tland.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 4 Hervarar saga also mentions that Harald retook his grandfather's domains, but it says that the conquests started out from G√∂taland (or Gotland depending on the manuscript). The Hervarar saga also alleges that Harald's nephew Sigurd Hring became (subservient) king over Denmark, which is gainsaid by other sources.Tolkien & Turville-Petre (1956), p. 68. S√∂gubrot relates that Hring (Sigurd Hring) received Sweden and V√§sterg√∂tland from his aging uncle, who kept Denmark and √ñsterg√∂tland for himself.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 6 . Gesta Danorum agrees with S√∂gubrot by saying that the conquests began from Zealand, but adds many details. During an early battle in Zealand he was critically wounded by the champion Veseti and barely saved by his mother Gyrid. Later on he murdered Veseti on the latter's wedding night in Scania, and proceeded in slaying King Hader of Jutland and two further petty rulers called Hunding and R√∏rik, seizing the traditional royal center in Lejre. He was favoured by Odin, so that steel could not hurt him; in return, he offered the souls of those slain by his sword to the god.Saxo (1905), p. 456. When the Norwegian petty ruler √Ösmund was deposed by his own sister, Harald intervened with a single ship to remedy this infamy. Unarmed and clad in a purple cloak and gold-embroidered coif, he strode towards the enemy at the head of his troops, while the adversaries vainly showered him with javelins. After victory was won, he restored √Ösmund, commenting that \\"the reward of glory was enough by itself\\".Saxo (1905), p. 457. Meanwhile the Swedish ruler Yngve attacked Denmark in order to expand his realm. Before battle had been joined, Odin appeared before Harald and gave him valuable advice about military tactics, especially the wedge-like Svinfylking formation. Applying this, Harald was able to defeat and kill Yngve and his brother Olof. The third brother Ingjald then sued for peace, that was granted. Later on, however, Ingjald ravished the sister of Harald and the war flared up again. After some indecisive fighting, Harald accepted the Swedish king as a friend and brother-in-law.Saxo (1905), p. 457-9. When Ingjald passed away at a later time, his adolescent son Hring inherited him, while Harald appointed suitable guardians for the boy.Saxo (1905), p. 461. A new incident in Norway draw Harald's attention, as King Olaf of the Thr√∏ndir was attacked by the shield-maidens Stikla and Rusla. Again reacting to undue female agency, Harald intervened and slew the two women in person.Saxo (1905), p. 459. He next overcame a Frisian raider called Ubbe who had attacked Jutland. When Ubbe was captured after great feats of strength, he agreed to become Harald's housecarl and married one of the sisters of the king. Harald furthermore undertook successful expeditions of conquest along the Rhine, in the lands of the Slavs, Aquitania, and Humbria in England. His fame attracted warriors from various parts of the world, who formed a mercenary guard. The mighty Danish ruler spent 50 years in peace, meanwhile subjecting his personal troops to hard military drill.Saxo (1905), p. 460-1. The Battle of Br√•valla When Harald realized that he was about to die of old age, he suggested to Hring, king of Sweden, that a great battle should be fought between them. The place was chosen to be at the moor of Br√•valla, and so the legendary Battle of Br√•valla came to be.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 7 Harald hoped to die in this battle and go to Valhalla instead of dying in his bed and end up in Niflheim. The Gesta Danorum gives a partly different background to the war. Harald and his nephew Hring of Sweden both trusted a councilor called Brune. When Brune drowned on a journey, Odin, who had by now abandoned Harald's cause, took his likeness and began to weave a web of intrigues, successfully pitting the two kings against each other. The opposing sides therefore spent seven years in military preparations. By this time, Harald's old age and cruelty had made him a burden to his subjects.Saxo (1905), p. 468-9. Hring gathered warriors from Sweden, V√§sterg√∂tland and Norway, while Harald assembled troops from Denmark, the Baltic region and Germany.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 7 The two armies finally moved by sea and land towards the fixed place of the contest at Br√•valla. S√∂gubrot says that this was a moor beneath the forest of Kolm√•rden, close to the Br√•viken bay in √ñsterg√∂tland.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 7 Hring came first to the battle site and bade his army to rest until the Danes arrived. This took time for the ships were so thick upon the Kattegat that one could walk across the Sound on the ships from Zealand to Sk√•ne as if there was a bridge. When the armies finally opposed each other, Harald found to his consternation that the Swedish army applied the Svinfylking formation that had so often secured victory to the Danes. The Gesta Danorum makes clear that this formed part of Odin's sinister game.Saxo (1905), p. 481. The kings encouraged their warriors to attack without holding back. The lur horns sounded and the battle cries rose up. The battle began with an exchange of spears and arrows and even then, at the first, of the battle blood flowed upon the ground. Then swords were drawn and warrior fought against warrior. The most ferocious champion on Harald's side was Ubbe the Frisian who killed scores of enemies before being shot down by Norwegian archers. St√¶rkod, on Hring's side, fought first with Ubbe the Frisian and received of him six wounds before the combatants drifted apart in the chaos. Then he fought with the shield maiden, Veborg, who struck him in the face so that his beard dangled loose, but he bit his beard to hold on to it. Then he met the shield maiden, Visne. \\"You hurry to your death!\\" she shouted. \\"Now, you shall die!\\" \\"No,\\" he cried, \\"not before you have lost King Harald's standard.\\" At that instant he struck her hand and went on.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 9 Blind, old King Harald rode out into the fray in a chariot with a sword in each hand and struck away at the enemy. Eventually Harald fell in the battle, according to the Gesta Danorum by Odin's own hand. The god steered the royal chariot in the shape of Brune and bludgeoned the king with a club (since he was hard against steel).Saxo (1905), p. 481. Along with him fell 15 kings and 30,000 free-born men. When Hring heard that his opponent had fallen, he instantly gave the sign that the fighting should cease. The day after the battle he sought out King Harald's body and put it onto a funeral pyre along with his horse. Hring stood before the fire and bade Harald ride straight to Valhalla and secure lodging for those who had perished. Thereafter, all the chiefs walked around the pyre throwing weapons and gold onto it.Fragment of a saga, Chapter 9 Sigurd Hring, traditionally the father of Ragnar Lodbrok, became the ruler of both Denmark and Sweden but not, it seems, of Norway which was then a patchwork of petty kingdoms. Historical origins The historicity of Harald Wartooth and the Battle of Br√•valla has been much debated over the time. Once seen as an essentially historical event taking place in about 740 or 750, the battle has undergone a number of reinterpretations. Paul Herrmann (1922) saw Harald as an \\"Odin hero\\" in an (originally) epically cohesive tale, without denying the possibility of a historical kernel.Herrmann (1922), p. 512-7. The saga scholar Axel Olrik (1914) regarded Harald as a historical Danish king who attacked an East Geatic King Hring. Though victorious, the East Geats were weakened and subsequently dominated by the Swedes. The archaeologist Birger Nerman (1925), on the other hand, argued that Harald was indeed the overlord over a comprehensive Danish- Swedish realm, while Hring was a sub-king with authority over Sweden, V√§sterg√∂tland and Gotland. By defeating Harald in the mid 8th century, the Swedes were supposedly able to subordinate √ñsterg√∂tland.Nerman (1925), p. 256-62. Later, Stig Wikander (1960) hypothesized that the battle was an eschatological myth with parallels to Indian mythology, an idea that has been endorsed by some modern scholars.Hultg√•rd (2017), p. 165-6 The Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde (1999) concludes that the battle has \\"perhaps certainly\\" a legendary and fictitious basis, and that the location to √ñsterg√∂tland is likely a later literary addition.Reallexikon, Vol. 13, p. 645-7. Most modern Scandinavian historians decline to discuss the background of Harald and the battle due to the late sources.Harrison (2002), p. 23. Frankish sources name three Danish kings of the 8th century, namely Angantyr (early 8th century), Sigfred (fl. 777-798) and Harald (years unknown, but older kinsman of a set of brothers who flourished after 812). An annal entry of 813 shows that the rivals of this Harald's nephews sought support in the struggle for Danish kingship among the Swedes, successfully ousting Harald's kin.Baldwin (1996) Whether vague memories of this dynastic contest are reflected in Harald Wartooth's story is a moot point.Waggoner (2009), p. xviii.

He was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party between 1975 and 1978. Huband attended the University of Manitoba in the 1950s, earning his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba in 1955. Huband was a member of the Metropolitan Council of Winnipeg from 1964 until 1968 (in which year he served as its Vice Chair). He supported the amalgamation of the city with its suburban neighbourhoods, which was accomplished in the early 1970s by New Democratic Party Premier Edward Schreyer. Huband first attempted to run for the provincial legislature in 1966, but lost the Liberal nomination in Wolseley to Julius Koteles. He later alleged that Koteles signed up several \\"instant members\\" to win the nomination. He ran in the upscale riding of River Heights in the 1973 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative leader Sidney Spivak. Huband was elected leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party on February 22, 1975, defeating his lone opponent Lloyd Henderson by 381 votes to 87. The party had only four seats in the 57-member legislature at the time, and was in need of renewal. Huband represented a more centrist direction in the party, which had long been considered very right-wing for its time. Under the rural populism of Robert Bend and the libertarianism of Israel Asper, the party's electoral fortunes had progressively declined. In a province that had become increasingly polarized between the Tories and NDP, the Liberals were finding it increasingly difficult to present themselves as an alternative. Huband declared himself a candidate when the central Winnipeg seat of Crescentwood became vacant in early 1975, after the one-vote victory of NDP MLA Harvey Patterson in the 1973 election was overturned. Huband was narrowly defeated by Tory incumbent Warren Steen. He again lost to Steen in the general election of 1977, as the Manitoba Liberals fell to only one seat (that of Lloyd Axworthy). Huband resigned as party leader in 1978, and later became a Manitoba Court of Appeal judge. In the mid-1990s, he ruled that the Canadian Wheat Board could not be sued by producers. This decision was given in response to a challenge initiated by the right-wing group Farmers For Justice. In 1996, Huband's years of service to the legal profession were recognized by the Manitoba Bar Association, which presented him with its Distinguished Service Award. In 2007, Huband retired from the Manitoba Court of Appeal and resumed private practice, joining the firm of Taylor McCaffrey LLP. Huband is also an active member of the United Church of Canada and in June 2014 he was elected to the governing council of the Manitoba Historical Society. Huband tried to return to politics when he won the Liberal nomination in the riding of Portage la Prairie during the 2019 provincial election, and finished a distant third.

It contains one species, A. natans. The genus name comes from Latin ambulare \\"to walk\\" and cetus \\"whale\\", and the species name natans \\"swimming\\". It is known primarily from a single skeleton which is about 80% complete, and is among the most completely known Eocene cetaceans, instrumental in the study of cetacean evolution and the transition from land to sea. Most notably, Ambulocetus had four functional limbs, and was the first cetacean postulated to have preserved a suite of adaptations consistent with an amphibious lifestyle. Ambulocetus is classified in the group Archaeoceti‚Äîthe ancient forerunners of modern cetaceans whose members span the transition from land to sea‚Äîand in the family Ambulocetidae, which includes Himalayacetus and Gandakasia (also from the Eocene of the Indian subcontinent). Ambulocetus probably had a long, broad, and powerful snout, and the eyes were placed near the top of the head. Because of these, it is hypothesised to have behaved much like a crocodile, waiting near the water's surface and ambushing large mammals, using the jaws to clamp onto and drown or thrash prey. The modern cetacean ear is highly specialised for hearing underwater and detecting certain frequencies, and Ambulocetus seems to share some of these traits. It is unclear if it used its specialised ear for hearing underwater, bone conduction on land, or if the adaptations were entirely non- functional in less aquatic cetaceans. Ambulocetus had a narrow, streamlined body, and heavy, pachyostotic ribs. Ambulocetus is thought to have swum much like modern river otters, alternating beats of the hind limbs while keeping the forelimbs tucked in for most of its propulsive power, as well as undulating the torso and tail. On land, Ambulocetus may have walked much like a sea lion. It may have had webbed feet and lacked a tail fluke. The Indian subcontinent during the Eocene was an island beginning its collision with Asia, which would eventually lead to the uplifting of the Himalayas. India had a hot climate with tropical rainforests and coastal mangroves. Ambulocetus was found in an area which was a shallow sea off the shores of a coastal swamp or forest, and it may have predominantly inhabited brackish areas such as at a river mouth. It lived alongside requiem sharks, catfish, other fish, turtles, crocodiles, the amphibious hoofed mammal Anthracobune, and the fellow cetaceans Gandakasia, Attockicetus, Nalacetus, and Pakicetus. Taxonomy =Discovery= Hans Thewissen with the holotype Ambulocetus skeleton The first remains were unearthed by an expedition jointly funded by Howard University and the Geological Survey of Pakistan, in the upper Kuldana Formation in the Kala Chitta Hills of Punjab, Pakistan, dating to the middle Eocene. The formation is constrained to sometime during the Lutetian stage. The holotype specimen, HGSP 18507, is a partial skeleton initially discovered preserving a partial skull excluding the snout, some elements of the vertebral column and ribs, as well as portions of the fore- and hind-limb. Other specimens initially found were HGSP 18473 (a second premolar), HGSP 18497 (a third premolar), HGSP 18472 (a tail vertebra), and HGSP 18476 (lower portion of a femur). The holotype was found in a silt and mudstone bed over a area. These were first described in 1994 by palaeontologists Hans Thewissen, Sayed Taseer Hussain, and Mohammad Arif. They identified the remains as clearly belonging to a seemingly amphibious cetacean (now whales, dolphins, and porpoises), and so named it Ambulocetus natans. The genus name comes from Latin ambulare \\"to walk\\" and cetus \\"whale\\", and the species name natans \\"swimming\\". Further excavation recovered most of the holotype's skeleton‚Äîmost notably the hip, sacrum, and most of ribcage and thoracolumbar series‚Äîleaving it about 80% complete by 2002. This made it the most completely known cetacean from the time period. In 2009, some more elements of the holotype's jawbone were identified. Though it was known that cetaceans descended from land mammals, the only evidence of this in the fossil record was the 52-million- year-old (fully terrestrial) Pakicetus and a hypothesised link between cetaceans and the Paleocene mesonychids. More aquatic Eocene cetaceans did not preserve limbs very well. The describers noted that, \\"Ambulocetus represents a critical intermediate between land mammals and marine cetaceans.\\" =Classification= Modern cetaceans (Neoceti) are grouped into either the parvorders Mysticeti (baleen whales) or Odontoceti (toothed whales), and Neoceti descended from the ancient Archaeoceti, whose members span the transition from terrestrial to fully aquatic. Archaeoceti is, thus, paraphyletic and does not comprise both a common ancestor and all of its descendants. Ambulocetus was an archaeocete. After discovery, archaeocetes were classified into the families Protocetidae (which included what are now the terrestrial Pakicetidae, and the rest were amphibious), Remingtonocetidae (amphibious), Basilosauridae (aquatic), and Dorudontidae (aquatic, now a subfamily of Basilosauridae). The absolute earliest cetaceans were thought to be the mesonychids, proposed before any firm early cetacean fossils were identified. Upon species description, Ambulocetus was preliminarily placed into Protocetidae, until the further description of the holotype prompted Thewissen and colleagues to move it into its own family Ambulocetidae in 1996. At the same time, they also erected the family Pakicetidae. They also proposed that some members of Pakicetidae, Protocetidae, and Ambulocetidae were the ancestors of the other two archaeocete families. They suggested that mesonychids gave rise to pakicetids, which gave rise to ambulocetids, which gave rise to both protocetids and remingtonocetids. Though middle-to-late- Eocene archaeocetes are also known from North America, Europe, and Africa, the most basal of these are found only on the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, it is thought cetaceans originally evolved in that region. Based on molecular data, cetaceans are most closely allied with hippos (Whippomorpha) and to the hoofed even-toed ungulates (Cetartiodactyla), and they split approximately 55 million years ago. This puts mesonychids as a distant relative of cetaceans rather than an ancestor, and their somewhat similar physiology was possibly a result of convergent evolution. The oldest identified cetacean is the ambulocetid Himalayacetus dating to 52.5 million years ago (predating the terrestrial pakicetids), though the exact dating of Himalayacetus to Pakicetus is debated. Ambulocetidae also includes Gandakasia. Ambulocetidae is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, and spans the early to middle Eocene. Family tree according to American vertebrate palaeontologist Mark Uhen, 2010:  Description  =Size= Ambulocetus next to a tall man Upon description, Thewissen and colleagues guessed the holotype specimen may have weighed the same as a male South American sea lion, about , and perhaps measured roughly long. In 1996, they estimated weight, using the cross-sections of the long bones, as . Alternatively, they also estimated Ambulocetus as about by using the length of the second upper and lower molars compared to trends between this length and ungulate body mass, as well as by using the skull size compared to those of similarly sized carnivores. In 2013, American palaeontologist Philip D. Gingerich estimated a weight of , similar to modern cetaceans, based on vertebral size. Thewissen suggested that this may be an unreliable weight determinant as the vertebrae are unusually robust in Ambulocetus. =Head= Like other archaeocetes which preserve this aspect, the base of the skull undulates both towards the front and the back of the head, probably related to the shape of the nasal canal and its passage to the throat, and the narrow infraorbital region (the area below the eyes). It is wide compared to other archaeocetes, more like that of modern cetaceans. The narrow infraorbital space, made of primarily the pterygoid processes, also occurs in Remingtonocetus and Pakicetus. However, the pterygoids connect as far back as the middle ear, much farther than other archaeocetes including the more ancient Pakicetus. Most modern cetaceans have a falcate process which juts out prominently halfway between the hypoglossal canal and the ear; Ambulocetus has a similar process continuous of the pterygoid, but it runs alongside and behind the hypoglossal canal. Like many other archaeocetes, the pterygoids, sphenoids, and palatines form a wall lining the bottom of the nasal canal, which causes the palate to extend all the way to the ear. Like other cetaceans, Ambulocetus lacks the postglenoid foramen. The ectotympanic bone which supports the eardrum is similar to that of Pakicetus, about as long as wide, whereas later archaeoecetes have more elongate ectotympanics. The ectotympanics of all archaeocetes, nonetheless, are much different than those of terrestrial mammals. The ectotympanics of all cetaceans, including Ambulocetus, possess an involucrum (thickened lump of bone) at the medial lip. Unlike Pakicetus but like later archaeocetes, the tympanic made close contact with the jaw. Like later archaeocetes, Ambulocetus seems to have possessed an air sinus in the pterygoids. It may have also had paranasal sinuses. The parietal bones on the sides of the braincase are more perpendicular than in Remingtonocetus, which makes the cheeks appear less flared. Like Remingtonocetus, Ambulocetus appears to have had a small brain. The end of the snout of the holotype is missing, so it is unclear how long the snout would have been. The snouts for Basilosaurus and Rodhocetus are short and make up about half the length of the skull. Remingtonocetid snouts are quite narrow, which was clearly not the case for Ambulocetus. The mandibular symphysis of most mammals is at the midline of the jaw, but it extends much farther in archaeocetes; in Ambulocetus it reached the tailmost end of the first premolar. These suggest reinforcement of the jaw to withstand a strong bite force. Similarly, the strongest biting muscle in Ambulocetus seems to have been the temporalis muscle involved in biting down. Like other cetaceans, there are embrasure pits (a depression between the teeth), preserving the tooth positions for the fourth premolar, the first molar, and the third molar. Unlike later archaeoecetes, the roots of the molars do not extend to the cheek bones, and the third molar is not as nosewards as in remingtonocetids. The coronoid process of the mandible (where the lower jaw connects with the skull) in Ambulocetus is steep. In contrast, it is low and slopes gently down in basilosaurids and later cetaceans. The mandibular foramen open below the coronoid process, and is around midway between terrestrial mammals and toothed whales in size. Like other cetaceans, the hyoid bone is jointed a basihyoid bone which is about as long as wide. Unlike other archaeocetes, the eyes are quite large and are placed near the top of the head facing upwards. Ambulocetus skeleton reconstructed with incisors Unlike modern toothed whales which only have one kind of tooth (homodont), archaeocetes are heterodont. Judging by tooth root size, the lower canine was larger than the incisors. The teeth are more robust than those of Rodhocetus and Basilosaurus. The premolars were double rooted, whereas most archaeocetes have single-rooted first premolars. The enamel of the lower premolars is crenulated (has scalloped edges). The fourth premolar is a high triangular shape. Like other ancient cetaceans, and most pronouncely in ambulocetids, the lower molars are shorter than the back premolars. The lower premolars are larger than those of Pakicetus and are separated by wider gaps (diastema). The molars had distinct trigonid and talonid cusps (these cusps are lost in basilosaurids), and the upper molars were trituberculate like ancient archaeocetes and ancient placental mammals, with a large protocone, distinct paracone and metacone, and no accessory cusps. Later archaeocetes developed accessory cusps. =Vertebrae= Reconstruction of Ambulocetus The holotype preserved seven neck vertebrae, which are rather long at . The 16 preserved thoracic vertebrae have thick spinous and transverse processes (which jut upwards and obliquely from the centrum), with deep depressions on both sides at the tail-end of each centrum which may have supported strong longissimus which flex the spine. The thoracic vertebrae become longer and wider tailwards and are tallest mid- series. In front-view (anterior aspect), the centra go from heart-shaped to kidney-shaped by T8. The pedicals (between the centrum and a transverse process) feature deep grooves. The spinous processes project tailwards from T1‚ÄìT9, T10's projects straight up, T11 and T12 project headwards, and the rest project straight up. The spinous processes progressively increase in length and width from T11‚ÄìT16. T10 seems to have been at the level of the thoracic diaphragm. T1‚ÄìT12 and T14 have capitular facets on the top margin of both the frontward and tailward side to join with the ribs. T15 and T16 have capitular facets on the headward side and lack transverse processes. T11‚ÄìT15 have accessory anapophyses which jut straight up from the top border between the centrum and the transverse processes; and in T16, these are small, originate near the pedicles, and project tailwards. The width between articular processes (two masses of bone which jut out of each centrum to connect with the next centrum) continually increases through the thoracolumbar series. In life, it is possible it had up to 17 thoracic vertebrae. The eight preserved lumbar vertebrae are much longer than the thoracic, and the centra and transverse processes, from L1‚ÄìL7, continually increase in length and height. The short transverse processes on L8 are probably due to its proximity to the ilium on the hip. The undersides are concave. The spinous processes are long and tall, and project headward from L1‚ÄìL5, and straight-up from L6‚ÄìL8. The spinous processes are bulbous on the tailward size to support epaxial muscles. The vertebral laminae are excavated headward to support the interspinous ligaments which connect the spinous processes. The vertebrae are about as robust as those of modern female leopard seals and walruses. The surface where the vertebrae join is flat rather than revolute, which would have made the series more flexible than that of terrestrial relatives. For the four preserved sacral vertebrae, the transverse processes of S1 are smaller than those of L8, and form a robust sacroiliac joint with the hip. For the spinous processes, those of S1‚ÄìS3 are fused. Metapophyses jut straight up from each lamina near the joint, progressively getting smaller with each vertebra. The holotype preserves 26 ribs, though it is thought to have had 32 in life. The cortical bone (the outermost layer) is thickest at the neck of the rib (between the joint and the costal cartilage), at max , and was filled with spongy bone. That is, unlike many other aquatic mammals, the ribs did not exhibit osteosclerosis; they did, however, exhibit pachyostosis and were made thicker and heavier with additional layers of bones. The shape of the ribs indicates Ambulocetus had a narrow and heart-shaped thorax looking at it head- on. Ribs are thickest at the T8‚ÄìT10 level, and then they get thinner. Ribs are broadest at the sternum, which suggests strong sternocostal joints. In the side view, the ribs have a slight S-curve, with the rib heads angled headwards, and the sternocostal joints angled tailwards. The holotype preserves a central and a tailward sternum bone which are both exceedingly thick, about on the outer margins and decreasing towards the centre. The central sternum bone is longer and wider than the tailward one. Only five of the tail vertebrae are preserved: a possible C1 or C2, a possible C3, a possible C4, a possible C7, and a possible C8. The more headward tail vertebrae have thick transverse processes, whereas those of the middle tail vertebrae are longer-than-broad. The C3 has a narrow spinous process and is mostly columnar, but the tailward side is broader. The C4 is more columnar. The C7 and C8 are columnar and taper off tailward, and the neural canal where the central nervous system runs through is still present. In life, Ambulocetus possibly had upwards of 20 tail vertebrae. =Limbs= Ambulocetus hindlimbs Unlike modern cetaceans, Ambulocetus had functional legs which could support the animal's bodyweight on land. The holotype has a robust radius and ulna (the forearm bones). The head of the radius was somewhat triangular, which probably meant the forearm was locked in a semi-pronated position. The olecranon, which forms part of the elbow joint, makes up about a third of the ulna's length, and is inclined tailward which would have allowed the triceps to more forcefully flex the elbow. The wrist bones indicate a strong flexor carpi ulnaris muscle for wrist flexion. The hand had five widely spaced digits. The first metacarpal (for the thumb) is long, the second , the third , the fourth , and the fifth . Like modern beaked whales, the thumb is short and slender. The ilium of the hip of Ambulocetus, like remingtonocetids, features deep depressions to support the rectus femoris and the gluteal muscles. Unlike terrestrial mammals and protocetids, the ischium is expanded dorsolaterally (from left to right, and leaning towards the head), which would have increased lever arm for thigh and leg retractor muscles when extended, such as while swimming. This would have also increased the surface area of the gemelli muscles (hip rotators which stabilise the hip) and the tail muscles. The widening of the ischial width may have also given Ambulocetus a more streamlined and thus hydrodynamic body. Ambulocetus had a pubic symphysis connecting the two pubic bones at the base of the pelvis together, which indicates the animal could support its own weight on land. The modern cetacean pubis bone lacks this and functions to anchor abdominal and urogenital muscles. The leg proportions of Ambulocetus are similar to otters and seals, and American mammalogist Alfred Brazier Howell predicted similar proportions for a transitional cetacean in 1930. The femur measures , which is similar to the presumably cursorial mesonychid Pachyaena. Archaeocete femurs are generally much shorter. The femoral head is spherical and, at maximum, has a width of , similar to Indocetus but much larger than mesonychids and Rodhocetus. The trochanteric fossa, supporting the lateral rotator group at the hip, is quite deep, but other than this, the femur does not seem to have supported particularly strong extensor or flexor muscles. The femoral condyles of Ambulocetus are quite long compared to those of other archaeocetes and mesonychids, suggesting the knee was capable of hyperflexion. The tibia is overall similar to those of mesonychids. The feet are huge, probably longer than the thigh and leg. The toes are also relatively long, with the fourth digit measuring in length. The fifth digit is slightly shorter and much less robust than the fourth. The phalanges of the toes are short, and end with a convex hoof. Like seals, the phalanges of both the hands and feet are flattened, which may have streamlined them to allow for webbed feet.  Palaeobiology  =Diet= Restoration of Ambulocetus The robustness of the cheek teeth, as well as the cusp arrangement, suggests they were involved in crushing, and the fact that both the premolars and molars were involved in crushing indicates Ambulocetus required a large area for crushing (probably because it was crushing large items). Similarly, the broad and powerful snout makes it unlikely it was pursuing small, quick prey items (which would have required a narrow snout like dolphins or gharials). The snout was also long, which may have precluded the ability to break a bone as it would have had reduced structural integrity at the tip. The anatomy of the cheek teeth resembles those of Mesozoic marine reptiles which fed on armoured fish, large fish, reptiles, and ammonites, and the teeth may have been used to grip onto prey firmly. Therefore, it most likely that Ambulocetus was an ambush predator, the jaw adapted to handle struggling prey. The unusually deep pterygoids potentially functioned to dissipate force while the prey was struggling. The eyes of Ambulocetus were placed on the top of the head, similar to crocodiles and other animals that prefer to keep most of their body submerged with the eyes peeking out of the water. The nasal canal has bony walls extending into the throat, which is used in crocodiles to keep the nasal airways open while killing prey either by drowning it or thrashing it around. Pieces of prey are subsequently torn off by forceful, thrashing head and body motions, with the feet anchoring the crocodile in place. Ambulocetus possibly used a similar feeding tactic, though Ambulocetus was probably capable of chewing, unlike crocodiles. Ambulocetus may have attacked large mammals which approached the water's edge, and semi-aquatic mammals including early (possibly herbivorous) sirenians (now manatees and the dugong) and the probably amphibious anthracobunids. These two seem to have been rather common on the Indian subcontinent, which could mean they were regular prey items. Since Ambulocetus was found in marine deposits (where animals would not come to drink), it is possible it hunted in river deltas which were preserved in the Kuldana Formation. Ambulocetus probably went after fish and reptiles when given the opportunity, though probably did not have the agility to commonly consume them. =Locomotion= Giant otter swimming at Tierpark Hagenbeck It is hypothesised that Ambulocetus was a drag-powered swimmer, and used its huge feet as its primary propulsion mechanism, much like modern river otters including the giant otter, Lontra, and Lutra. Based on the length of the tail vertebrae, Ambulocetus may have had a long tail, which would have made the tail an inefficient primary propulsion mechanism due to poorer lever arm (modern cetaceans have relatively short tail vertebrae). It is therefore unlikely Ambulocetus had a tail fluke. Nonetheless, drag powered swimmers still have powerful tails for producing lift, and the tails of river otters are 125% the size of the thoracolumbar series. So, using river otters as a model, Ambulocetus was possibly a pelvic paddler‚Äîswimming with alternating beats of the hindlimbs (without engaging the forelimbs)‚Äîand also undulated (move up and down) its tail while swimming. Like otters, its spine, particular the thoracolumbar series, was probably also undulating while swimming, so swimming was powered by both the tail and the torso. The pelvis and robust forelimbs have been used to argue that Ambulocetus was capable of weight transfer (walking) on land, and was more efficient at doing this than remingtonocetids and protocetids (it is unclear if the two latter taxa were capable of bearing weight on the limbs). Ambulocetus possibly used a sprawling gait on land, similar to modern sea lions. In 2016, Japanese biologists Konami Ando and Shin‚Äêichi Fujiwara performed a statistical test of ribcage strength among terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and fully aquatic mammals, and found that Ambulocetus clustered with fully aquatic mammals, because they assigned a very high rib density on par with fully aquatic sirenians which use their heavy, osteosclerotic ribs as ballasts. They then concluded Ambulocetus could not walk on land, but that the study was limited by a lack of information on the exact density of the bone, the location of the centre of mass, and the reliance of false ribs for thoracic support. =Hearing= Modern cetaceans have highly specialised ear bones to hear underwater as well as to detect certain frequency ranges. Unlike most other mammals, cetacean ear bones are comparatively thick, and so preserve more commonly. Modern cetaceans have air sinuses surrounding the ear bones (peritympanic sinuses), which acoustically isolate the ear by reflecting sound moving through the head and interrupting both bony and fleshy connections of the ear to the skull. Like later archaeocetes, Ambulocetus had at least one such sinus between the tympanic bone and the base of the skull. The evolution of these sinuses also seems to have caused some restructuring of the base of the skull due to the development of bony walls surrounding the sinuses. The ectotympanic of all cetaceans, including Pakicetus and Ambulocetus, has a bony growth (involucrum) on the medial lip, which is speculated to aid in the detection of low-frequency sounds. All cetaceans also have a vertical crest (\\"sigmoid process\\") right in front of the ear canal, which is speculated to be related to the increasing size of the malleus bone in the middle ear. As for the outer ear, terrestrial mammals channel sound in via an ear canal, but those of modern cetaceans are either narrowed or completely plugged, with sound being picked up (at least for toothed whales) by a fat pad in the lower jaw running to the ectotympanic bone. The size of the mandibular foramen can determine the size of the fat pad, and that of Ambulocetus is larger than that of Pakicetus and terrestrial mammals, but is smaller than later archaeocetes and toothed whales. Nonetheless, a lot of the change to the external auditory apparatus occurred between Pakicetus and Ambulocetus. These early archaeocetes may have developed such an external ear to either: better hear underwater; facilitate bone conduction of vibrations on dry land as some low-lying terrestrial creatures do (namely turtles and subterranean mole rats); or it was non-functional, and the malleus and jawbone (which are connected in the embryo stage of mammals) happened to stop separating. Palaeoecology Map of the Earth 50 million years ago During the Eocene, the Indian subcontinent was an island just beginning its collision with Asia which would eventually lead to the uprising of the Himalayas. The Eocene had a greenhouse climate (no permanent ice sheets at the poles) as opposed to the icehouse climate of today, so, in general, areas were much warmer than today. The abundance of Eocene brown coal deposits preserving tropical biota on the Indian subcontinent indicates the proliferation of tropical rainforests in a hot climate. Mangroves seem to have commonly grown along the western margin of the subcontinent in the early Eocene but decreased nearing the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. The waters off the western coast seem to have featured upwelling and low-oxygen. The holotype was identified in the upper level of the Kuldana Formation at Locality 9209, which features green mud and silt as well as a bed of marine shells, including marine snails (such as Turritella) and bivalves. It was likely a coastal area. A redbed underlies this layer, which is followed by grey, green, and purple freshwater mud, silts, sandstones, and limestone. These beds alternate with showing marine deposits. Near this locality, the formation begins with of grey and green mud, silt, and sandstone, containing two bivalve beds. The first often stretches only one shell, whereas the second stretches down, and the formation terminates with a bed before transitioning to the Kohat Formation. The holotype was found a few decimeters above the second bed. The upper Kuldana Formation may be contemporaneous with the Subathu Formation. The area may have formed in a shallow sea off the shores of a coastal swamp or forest. The only other vertebrate remain found at the 9209 locality was a (now lost) reptile scute. Other localities of the upper level of the formation have yielded remains of requiem sharks, the fish Stephanodus, catfish, turtles, crocodiles, and Anthracobune pinfoldi. Other archaeocetes are: the ambulocetid Gandakasia, the remingtonocetid Attockicetus, and the pakicetids Nalacetus, Pakicetus calcis, and P. chittas. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis indicates Ambulocetus inhabited brackish waters (part fresh and part salt water), possibly at a river mouth.

Description Pelvis of the holotype specimen This nodosaurid ankylosaur was about long. It was an ornithischian dinosaur with bony dermal plates covering the top of its body, and it may have had spikes along its side as well. The dermal plates were arranged in bands along its body, with narrow bands over the ribs alternating with wider plates in between. These wider plates were covered in regularly arranged bony nodules, which give the animal its scientific name. In 2010 Paul estimated its length at 6 meters (20 ft) and its weight at 3.5 tonnes (3.85 short tons). It had four short legs, five-toed feet, a short neck, and a long, stiff, clubless tail. The head was narrow, with a pointed snout, powerful jaws, and small teeth. It perhaps ate soft plants, as it would have been unable to chew tough, fibrous ones; or alternatively it may have processed the latter with gastroliths and its enormous intestinal apparatus.

They probably swam by paddling their large feet, which is not a very efficient mode of locomotion, suggesting they ambushed rather than chased prey. Ambulocetids had a narrow head with eyes facing laterally. Another lineage of fully aquatic freshwater predators, the neochoristoderes such as Champsosaurus, also have forward-faced eyes, as opposed to the dorsally positioned eyes of crocodilians and other amphibious predators.John Acorn, Deep Alberta: Fossil Facts and Dinosaur Digs, University of Alberta, 07/02/2007 Ambulocetus and Gandakasia primarily ate terrestrial prey, while a combination of low-oxygen isotope and high-carbon isotope values suggests that Himalayacetus consumed fresh water but ate marine prey, thus that it foraged in a marine environment but drank fresh water. Phylogeny Skeleton of Ambulocetus natans Ambulocetid fossils have been found in Pakistan along the former coastline of Cimmeria. The sedimentary facies in which these fossils were found indicates that ambulocetids inhabited a shallow, swampy near-shore marine environment. They may have occupied a similar ecological niche to river dolphins. The family is believed to have diverged from the more terrestrial Pakicetidae. The families Protocetidae and possibly Remingtonocetidae, are believed to have arisen from a common ancestor with ambulocetids. Together with Basilosauridae, the five families are classified under the suborder Archaeoceti.

Kensington RoadKensington Road Guide ‚Äî Kensington, London W8, LondonTown.com. is a section of road in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster, London, forming part of the A315 road. It runs along the south edge of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. To the west it becomes Kensington High Street, to the east it becomes Knightsbridge, while Kensington Gore is the name applied to the middle section. To the north is Kensington Palace and to the south, the road is joined by Palace Gate, Queen's Gate, Exhibition Road, and Rutland Gate (west to east). Kensington Road houses one of the remaining thirteen Grade II listed Cabmen's Shelters used by London's taxi drivers as a place to buy food and (non-alcoholic) drink. The London bus routes 9, 23, 52, 360 and 452 serve Kensington Road. Running adjacent to Kensington Road on the south side, separated by a high wall, is Prince's Gate. It was named after a gate into Hyde Park, opened in 1848 by Edward VII, the then Prince of Wales. In 1855 some stuccoed terraces were built opposite it, facing Kensington Road. They were described by Leigh Hunt as like \\"a set of tall, thin gentlemen squeezing together to look at something over the way\\". Many of the individual properties are now embassies or offices. Notable ones include: * The Embassy of Iran, 16 Prince's Gate * The Embassy of Ethiopia, 17 Prince's Gate * The Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum, 20 Prince's Gate * The Embassy of Thailand (branch), 28 Prince's Gate * The Embassy of Tunisia, 29 Prince's Gate * The Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, 30 Prince's Gate * The Embassy of Afghanistan, 31 Prince's Gate (entrance in Exhibition Road) Several notable people lived in Prince's Gate too.

He also worked as an advisor to Lloyd Axworthy. In 1979, Lauchlan was a federal Liberal candidate in the Alberta riding of Calgary West. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative Jim Hawkes. On November 30, 1980, Lauchlan was elected leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party, defeating Hugh Moran by 493 votes to 300. The Manitoba Liberals were in a precarious position in this period, holding only one seat in the provincial legislature (that of June Westbury, who replaced Axworthy in the by-election). With the electorate polarized between the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats, the Liberals were unable to present themselves as a viable alternative. In the general election of 1981, Lauchlan finished a poor third in the riding of Wolseley and the Liberal Party was eliminated from the legislature for the only time in its history. Lauchlan resigned as party leader in 1982. Lauchlan subsequently returned to Alberta. In 1988, he was recognized by the Canadian Speech Association as Speaker of the Year.

This algorithm can find the order of a finite permutation group, test membership (is a given permutation contained in a group?), and many other tasks in polynomial time. It was introduced by Sims in 1970, based on Schreier's subgroup lemma. The timing was subsequently improved by Donald Knuth in 1991. Later, an even faster randomized version of the algorithm was developed.  Background and timing  The algorithm is an efficient method of computing a base and strong generating set (BSGS) of a permutation group. In particular, an SGS determines the order of a group and makes it easy to test membership in the group. Since the SGS is critical for many algorithms in computational group theory, computer algebra systems typically rely on the Schreier‚ÄìSims algorithm for efficient calculations in groups. The running time of Schreier‚ÄìSims varies on the implementation. Let G \\\\leq S_n be given by t generators. For the deterministic version of the algorithm, possible running times are: * O(n^2 \\\\log^3 G + tn \\\\log G) requiring memory O(n^2 \\\\log G + tn) * O(n^3 \\\\log^3 G + tn^2 \\\\log G) requiring memory O(n \\\\log^2 G + tn) The use of Schreier vectors can have a significant influence on the performance of implementations of the Schreier‚ÄìSims algorithm. For Monte Carlo variations of the Schreier‚ÄìSims algorithm, we have the following estimated complexity: : O(n \\\\log n \\\\log^4 G + tn \\\\log G) requiring memory O(n \\\\log G + tn) In modern computer algebra systems, such as GAP and Magma, an optimized Monte Carlo algorithm is typically used.  Outline of basic algorithm  Following is C++-style pseudo-code for the basic idea of the Schreier-Sims algorithm. It is meant to leave out all finer details, such as memory management or any kind of low-level optimization, so as not to obfuscate the most important ideas of the algorithm. It does not need to actually compile. struct Group { uint stabPoint; // An index into the base for the point stabilized by this group's subgroup. OrbitTree orbitTree; // A tree to keep track of the orbit in our group of the point stabilized by our subgroup. TransversalSet transversalSet; // A set of coset representatives of this group's subgroup. GeneratorSet generatorSet; // A set of permutations generating this group. Group* subGroup; // A pointer to this group's subgroup, or null to mean the trivial group. Group(uint stabPoint) { this->stabPoint = stabPoint; subGroup = nullptr; } }; // The given set of generators need not be a strong generating set. It just needs to generate the group at the root of the chain. Group* MakeStabChain(const GeneratorSet& generatorSet, uint* base) { Group* group = new Group(0); for (generator in generatorSet) group->Extend(generator, base); return group; } // Extend the stabilizer chain rooted at this group with the given generator. void Group::Extend(const Permutation& generator, uint* base) { // This is the major optimization of Schreier-Sims. Weed out redundant Schreier generators. if (IsMember(generator)) return; // Our group just got bigger, but the stabilizer chain rooted at our subgroup is still the same. generatorSet.Add(generator); // Explore all new orbits we can reach with the addition of the new generator. // Note that if the tree was empty to begin with, the identity must be returned // in the set to satisfy a condition of Schreier's lemma. newTerritorySet = orbitTree.Grow(generator, base); // By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the permutations in the returned set are // coset representatives of the cosets of our subgroup. for (permutation in newTerritorySet) transversalSet.Add(permutation); // We now apply Schreier's lemma to find new generators for our subgroup. // Some iterations of this loop are redundant, but we ignore that for simplicity. for (cosetRepresentative in transversalSet) { for (generator in generatorSet) { schreierGenerator = CalcSchreierGenerator(cosetRepresentative, generator); if (schreierGenerator.IsIdentity()) continue; if (!subGroup) subGroup = new Group(stabPoint + 1); subGroup->Extend(schreierGenerator, base); } } } Notable details left out here include the growing of the orbit tree and the calculation of each new Schreier generator. In place of the orbit tree, a Schreier vector can be used, but the idea is essentially the same. The tree is rooted at the identity element, which fixes the point stabilized by the subgroup. Each node of the tree can represent a permutation that, when combined with all permutations in the path from the root to it, takes that point to some new point not visited by any other node of the tree. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, these form a transversal of the subgroup of our group that stabilizes the point whose entire orbit is maintained by the tree. Calculating a Schreier generator is a simple matter of applying Schreier's subgroup lemma. Another detail left out is the membership test. This test is based upon the sifting process. A permutation is sifted down the chain at each step by finding the containing coset, then using that coset's representative to find a permutation in the subgroup, and the process is repeated in the subgroup with that found permutation. If the end of the chain is reached (i.e., we reach the trivial subgroup), then the sifted permutation was a member of the group at the top of the chain.

Work as playwright Gibson's Broadway debut had been with Two for the Seesaw in 1958, a critically acclaimed two-character play which starred Henry Fonda and, in her own Broadway debut, Anne Bancroft. It was directed by Arthur Penn. Gibson published a chronicle of the vicissitudes of rewriting for the sake of this production with a nonfiction book in the following year, The Seesaw Log.

Ruskin says himself that the articles were \\"very violently criticized\\", forcing the publisher to stop its publication after four months. Subscribers sent protest letters, but Ruskin countered the attack and published the four articles in a book in May 1862. The book greatly influenced the nonviolent activist Mohandas Gandhi. The title is a quotation from the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard: The \\"last\\" are the eleventh hour labourers, who are paid as if they had worked the entire day. Rather than discuss the contemporary religious interpretation of the parable, whereby the eleventh hour labourers would be death-bed converts, or the peoples of the world who come late to religion, Ruskin looks at the social and economic implications, discussing issues such as who should receive a living wage. This essay is very critical of capitalist economists of the 18th and 19th centuries. In this sense, Ruskin is a precursor of social economy. Because the essay also attacks the destructive effects of industrialism upon the natural world, some historians have seen it as anticipating the Green movement.Wall, Derek (1994), Green History: A Reader. London: Routledge, pp. 117, 122, 207. The eleventh hour labourers, etching by Jan Luyken based on the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard The essay begins with the following verses, taken from Matthew 20:13 and Zechariah 11:12 respectively (in the King James Version):Unto This Last by John Ruskin > Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take > that thine is, and go thy way. I will give unto this last even as unto thee. > If ye think good, give me my price; And if not, forbear. So they weighed for > my price thirty pieces of silver.  Mahatma Gandhi's paraphrase  Unto This Last had a very important impact on Gandhi's philosophy.Gandhi's Human Touch He discovered the book in March 1904 through Henry Polak, whom he had met in a vegetarian restaurant in South Africa. Polak was sub-editor of the Johannesburg paper The Critic. Gandhi decided immediately not only to change his own life according to Ruskin's teaching, but also to publish his own newspaper, Indian Opinion, from a farm where everybody would get the same salary, without distinction of function, race, or nationality. This, for that time, was quite revolutionary. Thus Gandhi created Phoenix Settlement. Mohandas Gandhi translated Unto This Last into Gujarati in 1908 under the title of Sarvodaya (Well Being of All). Valji Govindji Desai translated it back to English in 1951 under the title of Unto This Last: A Paraphrase. This last essay can be considered his program on economics, as in Unto This Last, Gandhi found an important part of his social and economic ideas.

The term was created by Emily Pronin, a social psychologist from Princeton University's Department of Psychology, with colleagues Daniel Lin and Lee Ross.Emily Pronin, Center for Behavioral Decision Research The bias blind spot is named after the visual blind spot. Most people appear to exhibit the bias blind spot. In a sample of more than 600 residents of the United States, more than 85% believed they were less biased than the average American. Only one participant believed that he or she was more biased than the average American. People do vary with regard to the extent to which they exhibit the bias blind spot. It appears to be a stable individual difference that is measurable (for a scale, see Scopelliti et al. 2015). The bias blind spot appears to be a true blind spot in that it is unrelated to actual decision making ability. Performance on indices of decision making competence are not related to individual differences in bias blind spot. In other words, everyone seems to think they are less biased than others, regardless of their actual decision making ability. Causes Bias blind spots may be caused by a variety of other biases and self-deceptions. Self-enhancement biases may play a role, in that people are motivated to view themselves in a positive light. Biases are generally seen as undesirable, so people tend to think of their own perceptions and judgments as being rational, accurate, and free of bias. The self-enhancement bias also applies when analyzing our own decisions, in that people are likely to think of themselves as better decision-makers than others. People also tend to believe they are aware of \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" they make their decisions, and therefore conclude that bias did not play a role. Many of our decisions are formed from biases and cognitive shortcuts, which are unconscious processes. By definition, people are unaware of unconscious processes, and therefore cannot see their influence in the decision making process. When made aware of various biases acting on our perception, decisions, or judgments, research has shown that we are still unable to control them. This contributes to the bias blind spot in that even if one is told that they are biased, they are unable to alter their biased perception. Role of introspection Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler have argued that this phenomenon is due to the introspection illusion. In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects. They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating illusory superiority). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the bias blind spot). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others' bias. Pronin and Kugler's interpretation is that, when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether they themselves are biased, people look inward, searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives. Since biases operate unconsciously, these introspections are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias. Pronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias. Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers. Differences of perceptions People tend to attribute bias in an uneven way. When people reach different perceptions, they tend to label one another as biased while labelling themselves as accurate and unbiased. Pronin hypothesizes that this bias misattribution may be a source of conflict and misunderstanding between people. For example, in labeling another person as biased, one may also label their intentions cynically. But when examining one's own cognitions, people judge themselves based on their good intentions. It is likely that in this case, one may attribute another's bias to \\"intentional malice\\" rather than an unconscious process. Pronin also hypothesizes ways to use awareness of the bias blind spot to reduce conflict, and to think in a more \\"scientifically informed\\" way. Although we are unable to control bias on our own cognitions, one may keep in mind that biases are acting on everyone. Pronin suggests that people might use this knowledge to separate other's intentions from their actions.  Relation to actual commission of bias  Initial evidence suggests that the bias blind spot is not related to actual decision-making ability. Participants who scored better or poorer on various tasks associated with decision making competence were no more or less likely to be higher or lower in their susceptibility to bias blind spot. Bias blind spot does, however, appear to increase susceptibility to related biases. People who are high in bias blind spot are more likely to ignore the advice of other people, and are less likely to benefit from training geared to reduce their commission of other biases.

The River Cam enters Cambridge from the south west of the city and heads north past many of the historic colleges of the University of Cambridge along the open area known as The Backs. After passing St John's College, it turns sharply and runs east, passing the weir at Jesus Green and the boathouses alongside Midsummer Common. Passing Chesterton, it turns north again and leaves the city, running a further before merging with the Great Ouse at Pope's Corner to the south of Ely.  Bridges over the River Cam (south to north)  = Upper River (upstream of mill pond weir) =  Trumpington Bridge (1790)  The most upstream bridge in Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency) lies along Grantchester Road between Grantchester and Trumpington.OpenStreetMap: Trumpington Ward Also known as Brasel Bridge, this 1790 brick bridge replaced a wooden bridge at the site of a ford.S.P. Widnall, A History of Grantchester in the County of Cambridge, pages 23 and 120  Footbridge, Coe Fen  Links Coe Fen behind The Leys School over a second small bridge to Lammas Land, near the area known as Hobson's Paradise. Also known as Sheep's Green bridge, it was closed in the second quarter of 2006 to replace the steps with ramps to make it easier for cyclists and prams to cross. The bridge decking was also replaced.  Fen Causeway Bridge (1926) The first road bridge that is reached as the river enters the city. The road was formally opened on 9 December 1926.Plaque on bridge The bridge is sometimes called the \\"Lesbian Bridge\\", from the nature of the graffiti sometimes written on its underside.  Crusoe Bridge (1898‚Äì99)  A steel footbridge with timber deck and supported on four cast-iron columns,Cambridge Historic Core Appraisal - June 2006 - Coe Fen / Sheep‚Äôs Green linking Sheep's Green and Coe Fen, and the final bridge on the 'Upper River' before it reaches the small weir at the mill pond. = Middle River (between mill pond weir and Jesus Green weir) =  Darwin College Bridges  Two wooden bridges within the college grounds connecting the main site with the college's two islands.  Silver Street Bridge (1958)  The site of bridges back to the 14th century, a cast iron bridge was built in 1843 but increasing heavy traffic led to a 1913 survey that determined the need for a new bridge. Repairs, however, allowed the bridge to last for a further 40 years. The present wide bridge, clad in Portland stone was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1932 and built in 1958-9.  Mathematical Bridge, Queens' College (1902)  The Mathematical Bridge This is the third version of the design, first built in 1749. Cambridge University, Mathematical Bridge, Queen's College  King's College Bridge (1819)  The first bridge on the site was built in the 15th century, and has been rebuilt several times before the current incarnation, designed by William Wilkins and built by Francis Braidwood.  Clare College Bridge (1640)  Clare College Bridge The oldest of Cambridge's current bridges, this bridge in classical style was built in 1639‚Äì40 by Thomas Grumbold (d.1659)About Clare: History from Clare College's website, retrieved 25 June 2007 It is one of two bridges left standing by the Parliamentarian forces in the Civil War (the other being the Great Bridge, a wooden bridge which has since been destroyed) when Cromwell used the stone from other bridges to refortify the castle. Many different stories are told to explain the missing section of the globe second from the left on the south side of the bridge. One rumour is that the builder of the bridge received (what he considered to be) insufficient payment, and in his anger, removed a segment of the globe; another is that complete bridges were subject to a tax at the time it was built, and the missing segment made the bridge incomplete and hence untaxed. Cambridge University, Bridge, Clare College  Garret Hostel Bridge (1960)  At least the eighth bridge on this site on Garret Hostel Lane between the colleges of Trinity and Trinity Hall. The current design is by Timothy Guy Morgan, who at the time was an undergraduate student at Jesus College, after an open competition. Morgan died in 1960, before the bridge was completed. It was one of the first post-tensioned concrete bridges in the country. Known to students locally as ‚Äúorgasm bridge‚Äù.  Trinity College Bridge (1764)  Designed by James Essex, it replaced a stone bridge built in 1651, which in turn replaced a stone bridge pulled down in 1643 by Cromwellian soldiers as a defence during the English Civil War. It is a Grade I listed building. Cambridge University, Trinity Bridge Cambridge University, Bridge, Trinity College  Kitchen Bridge, St John's College (1709‚Äì11)  Cambridge University, St. John's College from Kitchen Bridge with the Bridge of Sighs to the right The second oldest of Cambridge's remaining bridges, built by Robert Grumbold (1639‚Äì1720) according to designs by Sir Christopher Wren. The bridge was crafted from a single block of limestone, carved to give the appearance of masonry.  Bridge of Sighs, St John's College (1831)  The Bridge of Sighs Probably Cambridge's best-known bridge, designed by Henry Hutchinson and based on a similarly named bridge in Venice, although the only real similarity between them is that they are both covered bridges over waterways.. A bridge in Oxford, also nicknamed \\"The Bridge of Sighs\\" but more reminiscent of the Rialto Bridge, links two sites of Hertford College, but it bridges New College Lane rather than a river or canal.  Magdalene Bridge (1823)  Magdalene Bridge viewed from the boardwalk near Quayside, with the tower of St John's College New Court in the background. Named after Magdalene College, which stands nearby. It is very close to the location of the Roman ford (around 40 AD), and the location of the first bridge in Cambridge (probably built by Offa in the 8th century). The latest bridge was designed by Arthur Browne in Gothic revival style and was rebuilt in the same style in 1982. = Lower River (downstream of Jesus Green weir) =  Jesus Lock footbridge (1892)  An iron bridge over the weir that divides the 'Middle River' from the 'Lower River', where punting gives way to rowing.  Victoria Avenue Bridge (1890)  Allowed the residents of Chesterton easy access to the city for the first time. The foundation stone was laid by Frederic Wace, mayor of Cambridge, on 4 November 1889 and the bridge was officially opened by Wace on 11 December 1890. The bridge was rebuilt for strengthening in 1992.  Fort St George footbridge, Midsummer Common  Named after the Fort St George pub near its southern end. This bridge is now open for use by cyclists.  Cutter Ferry Bridge  A pedestrian and cycle bridge that links Cutter Ferry Lane with Midsummer Common. The original footbridge was closed in 2003 after over 75 years of service, and removed during December 2004. The replacement, over which cyclists may now legally cycle, was opened on 20 May 2005. Also known by Cambridge residents as Pye's Bridge because of the one-time nearby Pye electronics factory, and by student rowers as Emma Bridge because of its proximity to Emmanuel College Boathouse.Image of Cutter Ferry Bridge  Elizabeth Way Bridge (1971)  A plain four-carriageway concrete bridge, opened by Lord Butler in his capacity as High Steward of Cambridge on 13 July 1971, this is Cambridge's most recent road bridge. The opening caused a few minutes of embarrassment when Lord Butler's golden scissors failed to cut the ribbon across the road. The bridge forms part of Elizabeth Way (A1134).

Green Dragon bridge, Stourbridge Common  Named after the Green Dragon pub opposite its northern end. Also known to student rowers as 'Chesterton Footbridge' as it crosses over what they know as 'Chesterton Corner'.  Railway Bridge  Crosses the river through east Chesterton, south of the A14 bridge. It is the third railway bridge to be built on this site, replacing a plain plate girder bridge which stood on the site between 1870 and 1930, which itself replaced a wooden bridge built in 1846.

Allison (July 12, 1846 - December 19, 1916) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a catcher for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional baseball team. Allison was one of the first catchers to stand directly behind the batter, as a means to prevent baserunners from stealing bases. He was considered a specialist, at a time when some of the better batsmen who manned the position normally rested, or substituted at other fielding positions. Allison was the earliest known player to have used a glove, when he donned buckskin mittens to protect his hands in 1870. His brother Art Allison also played in the Major Leagues. Career =Cincinnati Red Stockings= Not quite 22 years old, he moved to Cincinnati for the 1868 season and played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings managed by Harry Wright. Open professionalism was one year away but the long move from Philadelphia, where he worked as a bricklayer,Puff, Richard (1996). \\"Douglas L. Allison.\\" Baseball's First Stars. Edited by Frederick Ivor- Campbell, Robert L. Tiemann and Mark Rucker. Cleveland, OH: SABR. suggests that Allison was somehow compensated by club members, if not by the club. Cincinnati fielded a strong team that year, with five of the famous team already in place. Allison was a defensive specialist, his job was simply to catch the ball. First, he caught for Asa Brainard plus he had to contend with pop ups and tips off the bat, a fielder could put the batter out by a catch on the first bounce at that time. Most catchers of his era stood twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter. His technique of moving closer to the batter proved effective in curtailing baserunners from stealing bases. In the 1860s, it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs a game. As the technique of moving closer to the batter became more widespread among other catchers, run production began to plummet helping usher in what became known as the Dead-ball era. When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) permitted professionalism, the Red Stockings hired five incumbents including Allison and five new men to complete its roster, the first team that consisted of salaried players. A few of the others had previously played some catcher (all played at the six infield positions in 1868), but Allison filled the role in almost every game. Cincinnati toured the continent undefeated in 1869 and may have been the strongest team in 1870, but the club dropped professional base ball after the second season. =Later career= Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates for . The other five regulars including Allison signed with Nick Young's Washington Olympics, an established club that also joined the new, entirely professional National Association (NA). The five former Red Stockings led the Olympics to a respectable finish in the inaugural NA season. Later, Doug Allison played in the Major Leagues with the Troy Haymakers in , the Brooklyn Eckfords in , the Elizabeth Resolutes in , the New York Mutuals from to , the Hartford Dark Blues from to , the Providence Grays from to , and one game with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association in . Later life Allison was reported playing for a post office team in 1882. Thirty- four years later he died in Washington, DC at age 70, en route to his job at the Post Office Department.

For example, All languages have nouns and verbs, or If a language is spoken, it has consonants and vowels. Research in this area of linguistics is closely tied to the study of linguistic typology, and intends to reveal generalizations across languages, likely tied to cognition, perception, or other abilities of the mind. The field originates from discussions influenced by Noam Chomsky's proposal of a Universal Grammar, but was largely pioneered by the linguist Joseph Greenberg, who derived a set of forty-five basic universals, mostly dealing with syntax, from a study of some thirty languages. Though there has been significant research into linguistic universals, in more recent time some linguists, including Nicolas Evans and Stephen C. Levinson, have argued against the existence of absolute linguistic universals that are shared across all languages. These linguists cite problems such as ethnocentrism amongst cognitive scientists, and thus linguists, as well as insufficient research into all of the world's languages in discussions related to linguistic universals, instead promoting these similarities as simply strong tendencies. Terminology Linguists distinguish between two kinds of universals: absolute (opposite: statistical, often called tendencies) and implicational (opposite non-implicational). Absolute universals apply to every known language and are quite few in number; an example is All languages have pronouns. An implicational universal applies to languages with a particular feature that is always accompanied by another feature, such as If a language has trial grammatical number, it also has dual grammatical number, while non- implicational universals just state the existence (or non-existence) of one particular feature. Also in contrast to absolute universals are tendencies, statements that may not be true for all languages but nevertheless are far too common to be the result of chance. They also have implicational and non- implicational forms. An example of the latter would be The vast majority of languages have nasal consonants.Lushootseed and Rotokas are examples of the rare languages which truly lack nasal consonants as normal speech sounds. However, most tendencies, like their universal counterparts, are implicational. For example, With overwhelmingly greater-than-chance frequency, languages with normal SOV order are postpositional. Strictly speaking, a tendency is not a kind of universal, but exceptions to most statements called universals can be found. For example, Latin is an SOV language with prepositions. Often it turns out that these exceptional languages are undergoing a shift from one type of language to another. In the case of Latin, its descendant Romance languages switched to SVO, which is a much more common order among prepositional languages. Universals may also be bidirectional or unidirectional. In a bidirectional universal two features each imply the existence of each other. For example, languages with postpositions usually have SOV order, and likewise SOV languages usually have postpositions. The implication works both ways, and thus the universal is bidirectional. By contrast, in a unidirectional universal the implication works only one way. Languages that place relative clauses before the noun they modify again usually have SOV order, so pre-nominal relative clauses imply SOV. On the other hand, SOV languages worldwide show little preference for pre-nominal relative clauses, and thus SOV implies little about the order of relative clauses. As the implication works only one way, the proposed universal is a unidirectional one. Linguistic universals in syntax are sometimes held up as evidence for universal grammar (although epistemological arguments are more common). Other explanations for linguistic universals have been proposed, for example, that linguistic universals tend to be properties of language that aid communication. If a language were to lack one of these properties, it has been argued, it would probably soon evolve into a language having that property. Michael Halliday has argued for a distinction between descriptive and theoretical categories in resolving the matter of the existence of linguistic universals, a distinction he takes from J.R. Firth and Louis Hjelmslev. He argues that \\"theoretical categories, and their inter-relations construe an abstract model of language...; they are interlocking and mutually defining\\". Descriptive categories, by contrast, are those set up to describe particular languages. He argues that \\"When people ask about 'universals', they usually mean descriptive categories that are assumed to be found in all languages. The problem is there is no mechanism for deciding how much alike descriptive categories from different languages have to be before they are said to be 'the same thing'\\"Halliday, M.A.K. 2002. A personal perspective. In On Grammar, Volume 1 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum p12.  Universal grammar  Noam Chomsky's work related to the innateness hypothesis as it pertains to our ability to rapidly learn any language without formal instruction and with limited input, or what he refers to as a poverty of the stimulus, is what began research into linguistic universals. This led to his proposal for a shared underlying grammar structure for all languages, a concept he called universal grammar (UG), which he claimed must exist somewhere in the human brain prior to language acquisition. Chomsky defines UG as \\"the system of principles, conditions, and rules that are elements or properties of all human languages... by necessity.\\" He states that UG expresses \\"the essence of human language,\\" and believes that the structure-dependent rules of UG allow humans to interpret and create infinite novel grammatical sentences. Chomsky asserts that UG is the underlying connection between all languages and that the various differences between languages are all relative with respect to UG. He claims that UG is essential to our ability to learn languages, and thus uses it as evidence in a discussion of how to form a potential 'theory of learning' for how humans learn all or most of our cognitive processes throughout our lives. The discussion of Chomsky's UG, its innateness, and its connection to how humans learn language has been one of the more covered topics in linguistics studies to date. However, there is division amongst linguists between those who support Chomsky's claims of UG and those who argued against the existence of an underlying shared grammar structure that can account for all languages. Semantics In semantics, research into linguistic universals has taken place in a number of ways. Some linguists, starting with Gottfried Leibniz, have pursued the search for a hypothetic irreducible semantic core of all languages. A modern variant of this approach can be found in the natural semantic metalanguage of Anna Wierzbicka and associates. See, for example, andGoddard (2002). Other lines of research suggest cross-linguistic tendencies to use body part terms metaphorically as adpositions,Heine (1997) or tendencies to have morphologically simple words for cognitively salient concepts.Rosch et al. (1976) The human body, being a physiological universal, provides an ideal domain for research into semantic and lexical universals. In a seminal study, Cecil H. Brown (1976) proposed a number of universals in the semantics of body part terminology, including the following: in any language, there will be distinct terms for BODY, HEAD, ARM, EYES, NOSE, and MOUTH; if there is a distinct term for FOOT, there will be a distinct term for HAND; similarly, if there are terms for INDIVIDUAL TOES, then there are terms for INDIVIDUAL FINGERS. Subsequent research has shown that most of these features have to be considered cross-linguistic tendencies rather than true universals. Several languages like Tidore and Kuuk Thaayorre lack a general term meaning 'body'. On the basis of such data it has been argued that the highest level in the partonomy of body part terms would be the word for 'person'.Wilkins (1993), Enfield et al. 2006:17. Some other examples of proposed linguistic universals in semantics include the idea that all languages possess words with the meaning '(biological) mother' and 'you (second person singular pronoun)' as well as statistical tendencies of meanings of basic color terms in relation to the number of color terms used by a respective language. Though words in any given language may be polysemous, that a single word may possess multiple meanings, there appears to be at least one word in every language that has the meaning of '(biological) mother' and 'you (second person singular pronoun)'. For colors, there exists a pattern of an implication linguistic universal in relation to the various meanings of basic color terms with respect to the total number of words describing color. For example, if a languages possesses only two terms for describing color, their respective meanings will be 'black' and 'white' (or perhaps 'dark' and 'light'). If a language possesses more than two color terms, then the additional terms will follow trends related to the focal colors, which are determined by the physiology of how we perceive color rather than linguistics. Thus, if a language possesses three color terms, the third will mean 'red', and if a language possesses four color terms, the next will mean 'yellow' or 'green'. If there are five color terms, then both 'yellow' and 'green' are added, if six, then 'blue' is added, and so on.  Counterarguments  Nicolas Evans and Stephen C. Levinson are two linguists who have written against the existence of linguistic universals, making a particular mention towards issues with Chomsky's proposal for a Universal Grammar. They argue that across the 6,000-8,000 languages spoken around the world today, there are merely strong tendencies rather than universals at best. In their view, these arise primarily due to the fact that many languages are connected to one another through shared historical backgrounds or common lineage, such as group Romance languages in Europe that were all derived from ancient Latin, and therefore it can be expected that they share some core similarities. Evans and Levinson believe that linguists who have previously proposed or supported concepts associated with linguistic universals have done so \\"under the assumption that most languages are English-like in their structure\\" and only after analyzing a limited range of languages. They identify ethnocentrism, the idea \\"that most cognitive scientists, linguists included, speak only familiar European languages, all close cousins in structure,\\" as a possible influence towards the various issues they identify in the assertions made on linguistic universals. With regards to Chomsky's universal grammar, these linguists claim that the explanation of the structure and rules applied to UG are either false due to a lack of detail into the various constructions use when creating or interpreting a grammatical sentence, or that the theory is unfalsifiable due to the vague and oversimplified assertions made by Chomsky. Instead, Evans and Levinson highlight the vast diversity that exists amongst the many languages spoken around the world to advocate for further investigation into the many cross- linguistic variations that do exist. Their article promotes linguistic diversity by citing multiple examples of variation in how \\"languages can be structured at every level: phonetic, phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic.\\" They claim that increased understanding and acceptance of linguistic diversity over the concepts of false claims of linguistic universals, better stated to them as strong tendencies, will lead to more enlightening discoveries in the studies of human cognition.

Such one-parameter families are ordinarily referred to as strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups. The theorem was proved by , and showed that the requirement that (U_t)_{t \\\\in \\\\R} be strongly continuous can be relaxed to say that it is merely weakly measurable, at least when the Hilbert space is separable. This is an impressive result, as it allows to define the derivative of the mapping t \\\\mapsto U_t, which is only supposed to be continuous. It is also related to the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras.  Formal statement  The statement of the theorem is as follows. Theorem 10.15 :Theorem. Let (U_t)_{t \\\\in \\\\R} be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Then there exists a unique (possibly unbounded) operator A: \\\\mathcal{D}_A \\\\to \\\\mathcal{H}, that is self-adjoint on \\\\mathcal{D}_A and such that ::\\\\forall t \\\\in \\\\R : \\\\qquad U_t = e^{itA}. :The domain of A is defined by ::\\\\mathcal{D}_A = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\left  \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\left(U_{\\\\varepsilon} (\\\\psi) - \\\\psi \\\\right) \\\\text{ exists} \\\\right. \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. :Conversely, let A: \\\\mathcal{D}_A \\\\to \\\\mathcal{H} be a (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operator on \\\\mathcal{D}_A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{H}. Then the one-parameter family (U_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\R} of unitary operators defined by ::\\\\forall t \\\\in \\\\R : \\\\qquad U_{t} := e^{itA} :is a strongly continuous one-parameter group. In both parts of the theorem, the expression e^{itA} is defined by means of the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators. The operator A is called the infinitesimal generator of (U_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\R}. Furthermore, A will be a bounded operator if and only if the operator-valued mapping t \\\\mapsto U_{t} is norm-continuous. The infinitesimal generator A of a strongly continuous unitary group (U_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\R} may be computed as :A\\\\psi = -i\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{U_\\\\varepsilon\\\\psi-\\\\psi}{\\\\varepsilon}, with the domain of A consisting of those vectors \\\\psi for which the limit exists in the norm topology. That is to say, A is equal to -i times the derivative of U_t with respect to t at t=0. Part of the statement of the theorem is that this derivative exists‚Äîi.e., that A is a densely defined self-adjoint operator. The result is not obvious even in the finite-dimensional case, since U_t is only assumed (ahead of time) to be continuous, and not differentiable.  Example  The family of translation operators :\\\\left[ T_t(\\\\psi) \\\\right](x) = \\\\psi(x + t) is a one-parameter unitary group of unitary operators; the infinitesimal generator of this family is an extension of the differential operator :-i \\\\frac{d}{dx} defined on the space of continuously differentiable complex-valued functions with compact support on \\\\R. Thus :T_{t} = e^{t \\\\frac{d}{dx}}. In other words, motion on the line is generated by the momentum operator.  Applications  Stone's theorem has numerous applications in quantum mechanics. For instance, given an isolated quantum mechanical system, with Hilbert space of states , time evolution is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on \\\\mathcal{H}. The infinitesimal generator of this group is the system Hamiltonian. Using Fourier transform Stone's Theorem can be recast using the language of the Fourier transform. The real line \\\\R is a locally compact abelian group. Non- degenerate *-representations of the group C*-algebra C^*(\\\\R) are in one-to-one correspondence with strongly continuous unitary representations of \\\\R, i.e., strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups. On the other hand, the Fourier transform is a *-isomorphism from C^*(\\\\R) to C_0(\\\\R), the C^*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the real line that vanish at infinity. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups and *-representations of C_0(\\\\R). As every *-representation of C_0(\\\\R) corresponds uniquely to a self-adjoint operator, Stone's Theorem holds. Therefore, the procedure for obtaining the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group is as follows: * Let (U_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\R} be a strongly continuous unitary representation of \\\\R on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}. * Integrate this unitary representation to yield a non-degenerate *-representation \\\\rho of C^*(\\\\R) on \\\\mathcal{H} by first defining ::\\\\forall f \\\\in C_c(\\\\R): \\\\qquad \\\\rho(f) := \\\\int_{\\\\R} f(t) ~ U_{t} dt, :and then extending \\\\rho to all of C^*(\\\\R) by continuity. * Use the Fourier transform to obtain a non-degenerate *-representation \\\\tau of C_0(\\\\R ) on \\\\mathcal{H}. * By the Riesz-Markov Theorem, \\\\tau gives rise to a projection-valued measure on \\\\R that is the resolution of the identity of a unique self-adjoint operator A, which may be unbounded. * Then A is the infinitesimal generator of (U_{t})_{t \\\\in \\\\R }. The precise definition of C^*(\\\\R) is as follows. Consider the *-algebra C_c(\\\\R), the continuous complex-valued functions on \\\\R with compact support, where the multiplication is given by convolution. The completion of this *-algebra with respect to the L^1-norm is a Banach *-algebra, denoted by (L^1(\\\\R),\\\\star). Then C^*(\\\\R) is defined to be the enveloping C^*-algebra of (L^1(\\\\R),\\\\star), i.e., its completion with respect to the largest possible C^*-norm. It is a non-trivial fact that, via the Fourier transform, C^*(\\\\R) is isomorphic to C_0(\\\\R). A result in this direction is the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, which says that the Fourier transform maps L^1(\\\\R) to C_0(\\\\R).  Generalizations  The Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to a pair of self- adjoint operators, (P,Q), satisfying the canonical commutation relation, and shows that these are all unitarily equivalent to the position operator and momentum operator on L^2(\\\\R). The Hille‚ÄìYosida theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of contractions on Banach spaces.  References  Bibliography  * * K.

However, her name appears in the birth indexes for England and Wales for the July‚ÄìSeptember quarter of 1915. ‚Äì 24 March 1979) was an English stage, television and film actress. After beginning her acting career in theatre, Mitchell progressed to films in the late 1940s. Her roles include Julia in the 1954 BBC adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. She retired from acting in 1977. Personal life Mitchell was born Yvonne Frances Joseph, but in 1946 changed her name by deed poll to Yvonne Mitchell (without the Frances).London Gazette, 8 October 1946, p. 5007. Her parents were Madge (Mitchell) and Bertie Joseph. She was Jewish. Mitchell was married to the journalist, film and theatre critic and novelist Derek Monsey (1921‚Äì1979) and they lived in a village in the south of France. Mitchell died of cancer, aged 63, in 1979. Monsey died the same year, roughly one month earlier. Their daughter Cordelia Monsey is a theatre director and a long-term associate of both Sir Peter Hall and Sir Trevor Nunn. Yvonne Mitchell's grandson is the drummer and violinist, Mitch McGugan. Writing Outside acting, Mitchell was also an established author, writing several books for children and adults as well as winning awards for playwriting. Her plays include The Same Sky. She wrote an acclaimed biography of the French writer Colette, and her own autobiography was published in 1957. Acting Already an experienced stage actress, Mitchell made her speaking film debut in The Queen of Spades (1949), although she played an uncredited minor role in Love on the Dole eight years earlier. She had several prominent film roles over the next three decades, winning a British Film Award for The Divided Heart (1954) and the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival for Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957). She appeared as Mildred in the controversial film Sapphire (1959). Mitchell was voted 'Television Actress of the Year' for 1953 by the Daily Mail newspaper, mainly for her role as Cathy in the Nigel Kneale/Rudolph Cartier adaptation of Emily Bront√´'s novel Wuthering Heights. The next year, she appeared in another Kneale/Cartier literary adaptation in the role of Julia, with Peter Cushing as Winston Smith, in their adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four. She starred as Lea in the 1973 BBC TV production of Colette's Cheri. She continued to appear in television guest roles until the late 1970s, in series such as Out of the Unknown (in 1966); her final screen role was in the BBC science-fiction series 1990 (1977).

The objective of four square is to eliminate other players to achieve the highest rank on the court, and this is done by bouncing the ball back and forth between quadrants. A player is eliminated when a ball is bounced in a player's quadrant and the player is unable to touch the ball into another player's quadrant. It is a popular game at elementary schools with little required equipment, almost no setup, and short rounds of play that can be ended at any time. Playing environment Four square is played on any hard-surfaced court, such as wood, concrete or asphalt. There is no official court size, but typically courts measure between 10 and 20 feet (3-6 meters) on a side, and divided into four smaller equal-size squares. Each of the four squares has a rank and is occupied by a single player. The ranks may be arranged so that either the highest ranking square is positioned facing the lowest ranking square, or the ranks increase as one moves clockwise (or counterclockwise). The lines on the court are boundaries. The interior lines separating player squares are out of bounds. The ball may not touch any portion of an inside line or the player who hit the ball is in error. The lines marking the outermost edges of the court are typically considered in- bounds.Official Rules of Four Square. Squarefour.org (2004-09-10). Retrieved on 2011-06-18. These boundary rules are often described as \\"inside out, outside in.\\" In recreational play, and even with a judge in tournament play, it is often difficult to determine if the ball hits the line. Ball usage Four square is played with a rubber playground ball, typically diameter, and inflated to . However, other sizes and types of balls can be used. During regular play, or \\"classic,\\" the ball must be hit with the player's hands only. In classic play, carrying, catching, or holding the ball during play is not allowed, although putting spin on the ball is allowed as long as carrying does not occur. Prolonged contact with the ball can give players unfair control over the play. Hitting the ball must create a perceptible change in the ball's velocity (speed or direction). Elimination Players may be eliminated from the court because of errors or fouls they commit. Eliminated players leave the court, the remaining players move up to the next highest square, and a new player joins the court in the lowest square. Eliminated players wait in line for their next turn. The following actions may result in elimination (although many variations exist):Monstrous Collection of Cool Rules. Squarefour.org (2010-02-23).

It is possible to scale the game's difficulty and supervision appropriately for different age groups and ability levels. Schools, churches, and camps often change the size of the court, the type of ball, or aspects of the rules to create variation in play or to suit the players' abilities. History Four square dates back to at least the 1950s. A game called \\"four square\\" is mentioned in newspapers at least as far back as the 1950s, although the rules are not explained. Four Square is described with the same rules used today in a 1953 teacher's manual.

Usage of the term The term is used to refer to suboptimal traits that such a process may produce as a result of having to compromise between the requirements and viewpoints of the participants, particularly in the presence of poor leadership or poor technical knowledge, such as needless complexity, internal inconsistency, logical flaws, banality, and the lack of a unifying vision. This democratic design process is in contrast to autocratic design, or design by dictator, where the project leader decides on the design. The difference is that in an autocratic style, members of the organizations are not included and the final outcome is the responsibility of the leader. The term is especially common in technical parlance; and stresses the need for technical quality over political feasibility. The proverb \\"too many cooks spoil the broth\\" expresses the same idea. The term is commonly used in information and communications technology, especially when referring to the design of languages and technical standards, as demonstrated by USENET archives. Occurrences of \\"Design by committee\\" in Google Groups USENET archives, 1981‚Äì1992 An example of a technical decision said to be a typical result of design by committee is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell size of 53 bytes. The choice of 53 bytes was political rather than technical.D. Stevenson, \\"Electropolitical Correctness and High-Speed Networking, or, Why ATM is like a Nose\\", Proceedings of TriCom '93, April 1993. When the CCITT was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload. Parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length of 32 bytes. A 53-byte size (48 bytes plus 5 byte header) was the compromise chosen. The term is also common in other fields of design such as graphic design, architecture or industrial design. In automotive design, this process is often blamed for unpopular or poorly designed cars.Biggest Automaker Needs Big Changes An example described as naming by community was a school near Liverpool formed by the merger of several other schools: it was officially named the \\"Knowsley Park Centre for Learning, Serving Prescot, Whiston and the Wider Community\\" in 2009, listing as a compromise all the schools and communities merged into it. The name lasted seven years before its headmistress, who called the name \\"so embarrassing\\" cut it to simply \\"Prescot School\\".

Tenn.) is the Federal district court covering the western part of the state of Tennessee. Appeals from the Western District of Tennessee are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).  Jurisdiction  The jurisdiction of the Western District of Tennessee comprises the following counties: Benton, Carroll, Chester, Crockett, Decatur, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Henderson, Henry, Lake, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Obion, Perry, Shelby, Tipton, and Weakley. The court's jurisdiction includes the entirety of West Tennessee, plus Perry County in Middle Tennessee. This area includes the cities of Jackson and Memphis. The United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. The current United States Attorney is D. Michael Dunavant.  History  The United States District Court for the District of Tennessee was established with one judgeship on January 31, 1797, by .Asbury Dickens, A Synoptical Index to the Laws and Treaties of the United States of America (1852), p. 391.U.S. District Courts of Tennessee, Legislative history, Federal Judicial Center. The judgeship was filled by President George Washington's appointment of John McNairy. Since Congress failed to assign the district to a circuit, the court had the jurisdiction of both a district court and a circuit court. Appeals from this one district court went directly to the United States Supreme Court. On February 13, 1801, in the famous \\"Midnight Judges\\" Act of 1801, , Congress abolished the U.S. district court in Tennessee, and expanded the number of circuits to six, provided for independent circuit court judgeships, and abolished the necessity of Supreme Court Justices riding the circuits. It was this legislation which created the grandfather of the present Sixth Circuit. The act provided for a \\"Sixth Circuit\\" comprising two districts in the State of Tennessee, one district in the State of Kentucky and one district, called the Ohio District, composed of the Ohio and Indiana territories (the latter including the present State of Michigan). The new Sixth Circuit Court was to be held at \\"Bairdstown\\" in the District of Kentucky, at Knoxville in the District of East Tennessee, at Nashville in the District of West Tennessee, and at Cincinnati in the District of Ohio. Unlike the other circuits which were provided with three circuit judges, the Sixth Circuit was to have only one circuit judge with district judges from Kentucky and Tennessee comprising the rest of the court. Any two judges constituted a quorum. New circuit judgeships were to be created as district judgeships in Kentucky and Tennessee became vacant.The Honorable Harry Phillips, \\"History of the Sixth Circuit \\". The repeal of this Act restored the District on March 8, 1802, . The District was divided into the Eastern and Western Districts on April 29, 1802. On February 24, 1807, Congress again abolished the two districts and created the United States Circuit for the District of Tennessee. On March 3, 1837, Congress assigned the judicial district of Tennessee to the Eighth Circuit. On June 18, 1839, by , Congress divided Tennessee into three districts, Eastern, Middle, and Western.Alfred Conkling, A Treatise on the Organization, Jurisdiction and Practice of the Courts of the United States (1842), p. 42. Again, only one judgeship was allotted for all three districts. On July 15, 1862, Congress reassigned appellate jurisdiction to the Sixth Circuit. Finally, on June 14, 1878, Congress authorized a separate judgeship for the Western District of Tennessee. President Rutherford B. Hayes then appointed Eli Shelby Hammond as the first judge for only the Western District of Tennessee.

The lake is long and deep, making it the 2nd longest lake in the mountain parks of the Canadian Rockies (the result of a power dam at the west end). The lake is fed by the Cascade River, flowing east of Cascade Mountain, and runs south through Stewart Canyon as it empties into the western end of the lake. Numerous streams flowing down from Mount Inglismaldie, Mount Girouard and Mount Peechee on the south side of the lake also feed the lake. Aboriginal people long inhabited areas around Lake Minnewanka, as early as 10,000 years ago, according to stone tools and a Clovis point spearhead discovered by archaeologists. The area is rich in animal life (e.g. elk, mule deer, mountain sheep, bears) and the easy availability of rock in the mountainous terrain was key to fashioning weapons for hunting. The western end of the lake can be reached by following Lake Minnewanka road from the Trans-Canada Highway. Boat tours are available near the parking lot. A hiking and mountain biking trail runs along the northern shore of the lake, passing Stewart Canyon and six backcountry campsites.Canadian Rockies - Banff National Park - Lake Minnewanka Mount Aylmer which at is the highest mountain in this area of the park, is located a few kilometres north of the lake. Dams were built in 1912 and 1941 to supply the town with hydro-electric power. The most recent dam (1941) raised the lake and submerged the resort village of Minnewanka Landing that had been present there since 1888. Because of the presence of the submerged village, submerged bridge pilings, and submerged dam (the one from 1912) the lake is popular among recreational scuba divers. The construction of the dam resulted in involuntary resettlement of inhabitants from the reservoir area.B.

In 2020, Canadian filmmaker and YouTuber Dan Olson, who lives in nearby Calgary, attempted to demonstrate the curvature of Earth, and debunk the Flat Earth conspiracy theory, by filming a point at the lake's shore from the far shore, and moving the camera vertically up and down to show trees and other features disappearing behind the Earth's curved surface as the camera is moved closer to the ground.

The major action in its history was a January 22, 1980, demonstration, in commemoration of the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Between 200,000 and 350,000 people took to the streets this day in a country with just 5 million inhabitants. The security forces attacked the march with snipers located in the National Palace and other buildings in downtown San Salvador against the contingents of Frente de Acci√≥n Popular Unificado (United Popular Action Front) (FAPU) and Uni√≥n Democr√°tica Nacionalista. The contingents of Bloque Popular Revolucionario and Ligas Populares 28 de Febrero (LP-28) had not yet begun to march when the demonstration was dissolved. Later marches of the CRM were dispersed with particular dispatch by the National Guard, Hacienda Police, National Police and paramilitaries. The last big demonstration of the CRM occurred on March 24, 1980, during the funeral of Archbishop √ìscar Romero, assassinated the week before. The repression of the march was brutal and the marchers began to leave the streets and the CRM devolved into a coordinating body of unions, student, farmer and worker groups. The last actions were during the general offensive of 1981 (la fallida).

Influenced by the Sicilian School and Tuscan poetry, its main theme is Love (Amore). Gentilezza (Noblemindedness) and Amore are indeed topoi in the major works of the period. The name Dolce Stil Novo was used for the first time by Dante Alighieri (Canto 24, Purgatorio). When he arrives in Purgatory he meets Bonagiunta Orbicciani, a 13th-century Italian poet, who tells Dante that Dante himself, Guido Guinizelli, and Guido Cavalcanti had been able to create a new genre: a stil novo. Precursors to the dolce stil novo are found in the Proven√ßal works of the troubadours, such as the Genoese Lanfranc Cigala. The artists of the stil novo are called stilnovisti. Compared to its precursors, the poetry of the Dolce Stil Novo is regarded as superior in quality and more intelligent: it is a more refined poetry with regular use of metaphors and symbolism, as well as subtle double meanings. Poetry of this movement also often includes profound introspection. Many literary critics have argued that introspection in Italian literary works was first introduced by the Stil Novo poets, and later developed by Francesco Petrarca. Poetry from this school is also marked by adoration of the human form, incorporating vivid descriptions of female beauty and frequently comparing the desired woman to a creature from paradise. The woman is described as an 'angel' or as 'a bridge to God'. Rather than being material in nature, the 'Love' of the Dolce Stil Novo is a sort of 'Divine Love'. The two main concepts (introspection and love) are thus brought together as the poet enters his interior world to express his most inner feelings which are caused by an excessively divine female beauty. The first expression of this style of writing is credited to Guido Guinizelli and his poem Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore, whereas the major exponent of this school of poetry was Dante Alighieri, who is most famous for his Divina Commedia. The importance of the Dolce Stil Novo lies in the fact that apart from being the manifestation of the first true literary tradition in Italy, it ennobled the Tuscan vernacular, which was destined to become the Italian national language. The Stilnovisti influenced the later Spanish poet Melchior de Gualbes.

It was directed by Chris Wedge, co-directed by Carlos Saldanha, and produced by Jerry Davis, William Joyce, and John C. Donkin, and stars the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Amanda Bynes, Drew Carey, Jim Broadbent, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Coolidge, Harland Williams, Paul Giamatti, Dianne Wiest, and Robin Williams. The film follows a robot named Rodney Copperbottom who attempts to meet his idol at his company in Robot City, only to unravel a plot by its new owner to force older robots to buy expensive upgrades. Development began in 2001, when Wedge and Joyce failed to adapt Joyce‚Äôs book Santa Calls and they decided to do a story on robots. It is also the second film to be based on or written by William Joyce, with the first one being Buddy in 1997, as well as the first completely computer animated film to based on or written by Joyce. The film was released on March 11, 2005. The film received mixed to positive reviews, with critics noting its unique setting, story, humor, voice performances; including Ewan McGregor as Rodney Copperbottom and Robin Williams as Fender, John Powell‚Äôs score and animation. The film was a box office success, grossing $260.7 million on its $75 million budget. Plot In a world populated by sentient robots, Rodney Copperbottom, son of Herb and Lydia Copperbottom from Rivet Town, is an aspiring young inventor who idolizes Bigweld, a famous inventor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist whose company, Bigweld Industries, hires other inventors and provides robots with spare parts. Following Bigweld's example to \\"see a need, fill a need\\", Rodney develops a small, flying robot, named Wonderbot, to assist his father, who works as a dishwasher at a restaurant in town. When Herb's supervisor confronts them, Wonderbot malfunctions and wreaks havoc in the kitchen, leaving Herb in debt. To help Herb pay for the damages, Rodney decides to move to Robot City, hoping to present Wonderbot to Bigweld Industries in order to get a job there. Upon his arrival at Robot City, Rodney is ejected from Bigweld Industries by the company's current head Phineas T. Ratchet, who in Bigweld's absence has stopped producing spare parts in favor of expensive \\"upgrades\\", thereby \\"outmoding\\" robots who are unable or unwilling to pay for them. Ratchet's mother, Madame Gasket, runs the Chop Shop, a place that collects scrap and spare parts (and sometimes outmoded robots) and melts them to create ingots for Upgrades. Rodney befriends Fender Pinwheeler, a ne'er-do-well he met at the train station. Fender takes him in to a boarding home populated by other outmodes, known collectively as the \\"Rusties\\". Word of Rodney's mechanical prowess spreads, and he is hailed as a local hero after he and the Rusties fix outmodes throughout the neighborhood, although they are eventually unable to cope with the demand due to the spare part shortage. Hoping to enlist Bigweld's help, Rodney and Fender infiltrate the Bigweld Ball ‚Äì where Bigweld is reputed to make an appearance ‚Äì only for Ratchet to announce that Bigweld will not attend. Enraged, Rodney publicly berates Ratchet, who orders his security team to eliminate him. Cappy, a Bigweld Industries executive opposed to Ratchet's plans, rescues Rodney and Fender. Fender is captured by a Sweeper, a vehicle that collects scrap metal and outmodes, and taken to the Chop Shop where he discovers Gasket and Ratchet's plan to use a heavily-armed fleet of Super-Sweepers to destroy all outmodes throughout the city in order to make them into more ingots. Meanwhile, Rodney and Cappy fly to Bigweld's mansion, where they eventually find Bigweld and tell him what has been going on. But he reveals that Ratchet's greed and business sense won over his idealism in the management of Bigweld Industries, and orders Rodney and Cappy to leave. Crushed, Rodney calls his parents and plans to return to Rivet Town but Herb encourages Rodney to fight for his dreams or he will spend the rest of his life regretting it like Herb did. Fender returns upon escaping from the Chop Shop and reveals Gasket and Ratchet's plot. Rodney rallies Cappy and the Rusties to stop them, soon joined by Bigweld who has regained his resolve after realizing how much he and his ideals meant to Rodney. The group returns to Bigweld Industries where Bigweld fires Ratchet, who ultimately knocks him unconscious, planning on melting him down as well. Rodney, Cappy, and Wonderbot rescue Bigweld from Ratchet and escape with the Rusties in a security vehicle with Ratchet close behind. Rodney unclips Ratchet‚Äôs vehicle to break free but their vehicle loses control in front of the Chop Shop and Bigweld is rolled inside. Undetermined to give up, Rodney upgrades the Rusties to rescue Bigweld. Rodney, Cappy and the Rusties battle Gasket and her army of Super Sweepers alongside an army of outmodes that Rodney had repaired earlier. Rodney and Bigweld immobilize the Super-Sweepers and defeat Ratchet, who accidentally throws Gasket into the incinerator while trying to escape and is stripped of his upgrades, being left chained to the ceiling with his father (who was already there for an unknown reason). Taking control of Bigweld Industries once again, Bigweld promises to make spare parts available to everyone. Later, he holds a public ceremony in Rivet Town, where he nominates Rodney as his new second-in-command and eventual successor. Rodney provides Herb with new replacement parts and a flugelhorn-like instrument to fulfill his dream of being a musician. After a shaky start, Herb leads Rodney, Cappy, the Rusties, Bigweld and the townspeople in a rousing rendition of \\"Get Up Offa That Thing\\".

NAS Sigonella has the best claim to be hub of U.S. naval air operations in the Mediterranean. The base command is landlord to more than 40 other U.S. units. Among the largest are a rotating P-3C patrol squadron; a Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station; and a U.S. Naval Hospital. The hospital was built in 1992. Previously, there was only a clinic and the closest U.S. Naval Hospital was at Naples. Sigonella is home to more than 4,000 troops, civilian personnel, and family members. NAS Sigonella is the Navy's second largest security command, second only to that located at Naval Support Activity Bahrain. NAS Sigonella also has a large support of security personnel from NR NSF Sigonella, a Navy Reserve command based in NOSC Detroit at Selfridge ANGB, Michigan. The base comprises two sections: NAS I was the site of the original U.S. base but is now a support facility, and NAS II which includes the runways, operations and most tenant commands. NAS I also contains the Navy Exchange and Commissary, the school, and some homes, mainly for the commodore of Task Force 67, the air station commanding officer, air station executive officer and commanding officers of tenant activities. NAS I also is host to other facilities, mainly for entertainment. NAS II is now only used as a service base. History The United States Naval Air Facility (NAF), Sigonella, was established 15 June 1959. Its first commanding officer was Captain Walter J. Frazier. The facility was conceived in the early 1950s, when plans to base U.S. Navy P2V Neptunes at Hal Far, Malta began to outgrow the facility. When there was no room for expansion at Malta, the U.S. Navy obtained NATO backing to be hosted by Sicilians. Italy made land available under a temporary agreement signed 25 June 1957. Six days later, Landing Ship Tank (LSTs) began to deliver equipment from the Malta base. Ground was broken in September, and construction on the administrative area at NAF I was started in 1958. It was built on top of an airfield where damaged fighters and bombers of the German Air Force had once landed during the Second World War. The first Americans arrived for work at Sigonella in March 1959‚Äîsix months before any buildings were ready‚Äîand so worked for six months in Catania at a large warehouse complex called Magazzino Generale (General Warehouse), which is opposite the cemetery on the right side of the street as one enters Catania from the base. By the end of August 1959, the NAF II airfield was available for daylight flights under visual flight rules (VFR); 24 flights were logged by 31 August. One of Sigonella's first buildings was what is now the American Forces Network (AFN) building. In 1958, that building was Sigonella's vector (pest) control center, where rat poison was stored. The Army Corps of Engineers next used the building for their offices, later sharing it with Special Services, or what is now called Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR). Around 1966, AFN came to Sigonella and joined Special Services, which soon moved out, leaving the building to the broadcasters. Sigonella's first flood occurred mid-September 1959. The Dittaino Bridge between NAF I and NAF II was under six feet of water on 20 September and all traffic had to go through Catania. Power outages accompanied the floods. In 1965 the Italian Air Force sited at Sigonella the 41st Antisubmarine Warfare Wing (86st Gruppo and 88st Gruppo) with mixed crews from the Air Force and Navy. In the 1980s, \\"Naval Air Facility\\" Sigonella was redesignated as a \\"Naval Air Station\\". In 1983 the base was named after World War II pilot Captain Cosimo Di Palma (it), who was shot down by the Luftwaffe while on a mission with the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force and was honored with the Gold medal of Military Valor. NAS Sigonella during flooding in December 2005. On the night of 10 October 1985, there were tense hours on NAS II when the Italian Carabinieri, Italian Air Force, and the US Army's Delta Force came close to firing upon one another following the interception by US Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters of an Egyptian Boeing 737 airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship, the Achille Lauro, which had been commandeered by members of the PLO on 7 October. The hijackers had killed a Jewish-American citizen Leon Klinghoffer. The F-14s instructed the Egyptian plane to land at Sigonella where the Americans had planned to take the hijackers into custody. The Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi instead claimed the hijackers were under Italian jurisdiction. The Italian authorities therefore refused to allow the SEALs to board the plane, threatening to open fire on the Americans had they made an attempt to do so. This move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about terrorists targeting Italy if the United States had had it their way, and by the Italian tradition of diplomacy with the Arab world. The ensuing stand-off lasted throughout the night, until President Ronald Reagan gave the orders for the Americans to stand down. A taxiway on NAS Sigonella In late 1985, work crews belonging to NMCB 133 were repairing and installing sidewalks in the housing area at NAS I when they uncovered a small stockpile of Luftwaffe antiaircraft ammunition. The stockpile had apparently belonged to an antiaircraft position that had been buried during raids in the Allied invasion of 1943.Stars and Stripes Europe, 25 October 1985 On 1 April 2004, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) opened Defense Depot Sigonella Italy on NAS II to serve as a supply base for the Mediterranean. DLA also provides fuel and property disposal from NAS II. Sigonella suffered its second major flood mid December 2005. Over 400 service members and family evacuated. In 2006, a newly installed protective berm prevented a nearly second consecutive year of flooding. When NATO took military intervention to Libya in 2011, NAS Sigonella played an important role in US Operation Odyssey Dawn because of its short distance to the country. As Libya remained unstable in 2013, a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force‚ÄìCrisis Response unit was formed and an element of this was moved to the base to be within V-22 range of Libya.\\"US Repositioning 200 Marines in Italy as Precaution for Libya Unrest.\\"\\"Marine rapid reaction unit moved to Italy amid escalating crisis in Libya.\\" During the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, most of the base including recreational facilities, daycare programs and the school were shut down to slow the spread of the Covid-19 Coronavirus.\\"Facilities on US bases shuttered as Italy closes just about everything to fight coronavirus\\" Facilities =Airport= Air terminal of NAS Sigonella with Mount Etna in the background The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level.

Marinai flooded in December 2005 displacing many families temporarily. Also in Marinai is Boy Scout Troop 53 and Cub Scout Pack 53. Previously, \\"Mineo\\" was used as a housing base, but has since been returned to Italian Nationals and is no longer in service. Temporarily deployed unaccompanied military personnel, typically from rotational squadrons deployed from the United States, are housed in bachelor enlisted quarters and bachelor officer quarters located at NAS II. From 1987 to 2002, there was a base housing development Villaggio Costanzo which was located in the village of Santa Maria La Stella, in the comune of Aci Sant'Antonio, and approximately 60 minutes from NAS I. The closest community to the base is Motta Sant'Anastasia, where many military personnel and their families live in rented accommodation on the economy. Relations between the Americans and the local Italian nationals are cordial, despite some anti-American demonstrations outside the base protesting the Iraq War. Many Italian nationals are employed as civilian workers at the base.

Biography Ludwig Julius Sophus Felix Dahn was born in Hamburg as the oldest son of Friedrich (1811‚Äì1889) and Constanze Dahn who were notable actors at the city's theatre. The family had both German and French roots. Dahn began his studies in law and philosophy in Munich (he had moved there with his parents in 1834), and graduated as Doctor of Laws in Berlin. After his habilitation treatise, Dahn became a lecturer of German Law in Munich in 1857. In 1863 he became senior lecturer/associate professor in W√ºrzburg, received a professorship in K√∂nigsberg (in 1872). Dahn was married to the artist Sophie Fries (1835‚Äì1898), with whom he had a son. He tutored baroness Therese von Droste-H√ºlshoff, a relative of the poet Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff, in poetry from 1867 and entered an illicit love affair with her, which he gave a literary treatment in his Sind G√∂tter? (1874). He divorced his wife and married Therese, against opposition from both families, in 1873. Dahn relocated to University of Breslau in 1888, again as a full professor, and was elected rector of the university in 1895. As rector, he enforced a ban on Polish student associations.Norman Davies, Microcosm (2003), p. 305 He was an honorary member of German Student Corps and an active member of the nationalist Alldeutscher Verband. Dahn received honorary doctorates in Medicine and in Philosophy. Dahn died in Breslau, a month before his 78th birthday. Works Dahn's writings were influential in the conception of the European Migration Period (V√∂lkerwanderung ) in German historiography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His multi-volume Prehistory of the Germanic and Roman Peoples, a chronology of the Migration Period that first appeared in print in 1883, was so definitive that abbreviated versions were reprinted until the late 1970s. From the 1860s, Dahn regularly wrote for Die Gartenlaube. His nationalist historical novels were widely received, and according to Houdsen (1997) were influential in the formation of the v√∂lkisch ideology that formed the \\"Germany's pre-Hitlerian intellectual background for National Socialism\\". His 1876 Ein Kampf um Rom according to Kipper (2002) contributed to the ethnic essentialism and opposition to ethnic miscegenation of the \\"v√∂lkisch avant- garde\\".Rainer Kipper. Der German mythos in Deutschen Kaiserreich: Formen und Funktionen historischer Selbstthematisierung. G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2002. 394 pp. ., review at Humanities and Social sciences - Online - Net Dahn published numerous poems, many with a nationalist bent. His Mette von Marienburg portrays bands of \\"Masures and Poles\\" hiding in the \\"Podolian forest\\".Gesammelte Werke. Band 5: Gedichte und Balladen, Leipzig 1912. The comparison to packs of wolves is mentioned as stressing the \\"implacability of the Poles\\" alongside the writings of Arthur Jonetz and \\"many other German nationalists\\" by Besides his historical and literary production, Dahn also published a large amount of specialist legal literature, on topics such as trade law and international law.

This small, dog-sized animal was once considered to be the earliest known member of Equidae before the type species, H. leporinum, was reclassified as a palaeothere, a perissodactyl family basal to both horses and brontotheres.Florida Museum of Natural History and the National Science Foundation: Fossil Horses In Cyberspace Hyracotherium, page 1 The remaining species are now thought to belong to different genera, such as Eohippus, which had previously been synonymised with Hyracotherium. Description Hyracotherium averaged 78 cm (2.5 feet) in length and weighed about 9 kg (20 pounds).Radinsky 1978. \\"Evolution of brain size in carnivores and ungulates.\\" American Naturalist: 815-831. It had four hoofed toes on each front foot and three hoofed toes on each hind foot. Each toe had a pad on its underside, similar to those of a dog. It had a short face with eye sockets in the middle and a short diastema (the space between the front teeth and the cheek teeth). The skull was long, having 44 low-crowned teeth. Although it had low-crowned teeth, the beginnings of the characteristic horse-like ridges on the molars can be seen. Hyracotherium is believed to have been a browsing herbivore that ate primarily soft leaves as well as some fruits and nuts and plant shoots. Discovery Holotype BMNH M16336 The first fossil identified as being of this genus, holotype specimen BMNH M16336, was found in the cliffs of Studd Hill near Herne Bay, Kent, and described by the paleontologist Richard Owen in a paper read to the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1839 as a \\"small mutilated cranium about the size of that of a hare\\". He identified it as belonging to an extinct order of Pachydermata, with teeth resembling those of the Chseropotamus and the general form of the skull \\"partaking of a character intermediate between that of the hog and the hyrax, though the large size of the eye must have given to the physiognomy of the living animal a resemblance to that of the Rodentia.\\" Referring to this resemblance to the hyrax, Owen proposed the genus name Hyracotherium for this new genus.Owen, Richard (1840) ‚ÄúDescription of the fossil remains of a mammal, a bird, and a serpent, from the London Clay.‚Äù Proceedings of the Geological Society of London, 3(66):162-166 pp. 64‚Äì65 In his formal description published by the Geological Society in 1841, Owen wrote \\"Without intending to imply that the present small extinct Pachyderm was more closely allied to the Hyrax than as being a member of the same order, and similar in size, I propose to call the new genus which it unquestionably indicates, Hyracotherium, with the specific name leporinum.\\"Owen, Richard (1841) ‚ÄúDescription of the Fossil Remains of a Mammal (Hyracotherium leporinum) and of a Bird (Lithornis vulturinus) from the London Clay.‚Äù Transactions of the Geological Society of London, Series 2, VI: 203-208 A horse is a horse, unless of course‚Ä¶ ¬´ Playing Chess with Pigeons, 25 May 2008 In 1876, in America, Othniel C. Marsh found a full skeleton, which he placed in another new genus Eohippus, from the Greek Œ∑œéœÇ (e≈çs, \\"dawn\\") and ŒπœÄœÄŒøœÇ (hippos, \\"horse\\"), meaning \\"dawn horse\\". Its similarities with the fossils described by Owen were formally pointed out in a 1932 paper by Sir Clive Forster Cooper. The only species, E. angustidens, was moved to the genus Hyracotherium, which had priority as the name for the genus, with Eohippus becoming a junior synonym of that genus. Many other North American equids were subsequently classified as species of Hyracotherium as well, but this synonymy has recently been questioned. Taxonomy and evolution The type species, H. leporinum, is now regarded as a paleothere, rather than a horse proper. Most other species of Hyracotherium are still regarded as equids, but they have been placed in several other genera, such as Arenahippus, Minippus, Sifrhippus, Xenicohippus, Pliolophus, Protorohippus and the resurrected Eohippus. At one time, Xenicohippus was regarded as an early brontothere. The main stream of horse evolution occurred on the North American continent.

The act established a single office for a judge to preside over the court. Initially, the court was not within any existing judicial circuit, and appeals from the court were taken directly to the United States Supreme Court. In 1837, Congress created the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, placing it in Chicago, Illinois and giving it jurisdiction over the District of Illinois, . The Northern District itself was created by a statute passed on February 13, 1855, , which subdivided the District of Illinois into the Northern and the Southern Districts. The boundaries of the District and the seats of the courts were set forth in the statute: The district has since been re-organized several times. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois was created on March 3, 1905, by , by splitting counties out of the Northern and Southern Districts. It was later eliminated in a reorganization on October 2, 1978, which replaced it with a Central District, , formed primarily from parts of the Southern District, and returning some counties to the Northern District.

It played a major role in the Ogaden War of 1977-78 assisting the invading Somali Army. History Somali guerrilla activity in the Ogaden and in the Haud area east of Harar flared sporadically after Somalia gained its independence in 1960, but the guerrilla activity remained essentially a police concern until a border war erupted in 1964. When he seized power in Mogadishu in 1969, Siad Barre thwarted attempts at an understanding between Ethiopia and Somalia. He pledged to renew efforts to establish a \\"Greater Somalia\\" that would encompass about one-third of Ethiopia's territory. Encouraged by the breakdown of authority in Addis Ababa after the 1974 overthrow of Haile Selassie, Somalia provided equipment, as well as moral and organizational support to insurgent movements in the Ogaden and southern Ethiopia. The WSLF was founded by a young captain called Yusuf Dheere Mohamed Sugaal (Yuusuf the tall man) who was educated and trained in Syria, after finishing high school in Hargeisa. Upon his return from Syria, Yusuf Dheere has created the Ururka Dhalinyara Soomaali Galbeed or the Western Somali Youth Organization. Yusuf Dheere, who was well connected and from a noble family, met the Somali president Siad Barre in 1973 after putting the Somali elders behind his plan, and convinced the Somali President to do something about the Ogaden region. So Siad Barre gave Yusuf Dheere 2 years to give diplomacy a chance and to prepare the Somali National Army, for it was still unproven. In the meanwhile, Yusuf Dheere was told to recruit about 1500 volunteers and was permitted rations for only 1500 people; in the space of a month, he recruited over 3000 soldiers, most of them were old fighters from all over the country. Two years after the initial meeting, and after going through the UN and unsuccessful peace meeting with Emperor Haile Selassie, Yusuf Dheere was given the go ahead he wanted and was told to get control of at least 60% of the Ogaden region before the Somali army would involve itself in the fighting. The WSLF found its opportunity when the Derg overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, and switched from American support to the Soviet Union. Two years later, when the WSLF had control of most of the Ogaden, the first time since the Second World War that all Somalia was united with the exception of the NFD region in Kenya. The victory in Ogaden was mostly because of support from the Harari populace who had aligned with the WSLF. The WSLF was supported in its rebellion by the Somali Abo Liberation Front (SALF), whose sphere of operations was in the provinces of Bale, Sidamo, and Arsi, where it advocated union with Somalia or the creation of an independent state. Somalia equipped both groups with Soviet arms, and in early 1977 sent 3,000 soldiers from the Somali Army to fight as guerrillas with the WSLF. Both groups also received aid and training from various Arab and socialist states, including Cuba. Although the Ethiopian army outnumbered the Somalis by at least 3 to 1, the Somali army had much more air-superiority than the Ethiopians and was much better equipped. However, after massive Soviet support stopped and the United States did not accept the military support that Somalia had requested, the WSLF was forced later to retreat to camps in Somalia Proper after Soviet-supported and Cuban-armed Ethiopian and Cuban soldiers pushed back the WSLF and the Somali Army. The Somali government subsequently forbade the WSLF and its leaders to use its territory to launch attacks into Ethiopia. By 1989 the WSLF had ceased to be an effective guerrilla organization within Ethiopia. Siad Barre's decision to restrict the WSLF, led to the exile of Yusuf Dheere in 1989 and to the formation of a WSLF splinter group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), whose headquarters were in Kuwait. Elements of the ONLF slipped back into the Ogaden in 1988, where they still operate. However, not everyone was happy with the ONLF because of its name (Ogaden rather than Somali), therefore many of the original WSLF supporters formed the United Western Somali Front which also includes some former ONLF members.

He coined the term \\"magazine\\" for a periodical, founding The Gentleman's Magazine in 1731, and was the first publisher to successfully fashion a wide-ranging publication. The son of a cobbler, Cave was born in Newton near Rugby, Warwickshire and attended Rugby School, but was expelled after being accused of stealing from the headmaster Henry Holyoake. He worked at a variety of jobs, including timber merchant, reporter and printer. He conceived the idea of a periodical that would cover every topic the educated public was interested in, from commerce to poetry, and tried to convince several London printers and booksellers to take up the idea. When no one showed any interest, Cave took on the task himself. The Gentleman's Magazine was launched in 1731 and soon became the most influential and most imitated periodical of its time. It also made Cave wealthy. Cave was an astute businessman. He devoted all his energy to the magazine, and rarely left its offices at St John's Gate, Clerkenwell. He made use of many contributors, most famously Samuel Johnson, who was always grateful to Cave for having provided his principal employment for many years. Cave himself often contributed pieces to the Magazine under the pen name of Sylvanus Urban. He also obtained a licence from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine, a precursor of the water frame. In 1742 he bought Marvel's Mill at Northampton and converted this to a cotton mill, probably the first water- powered spinning mill in the world. This was apparently profitable, but only modestly so. It closed in (or possibly soon after) 1761. Cave suffered from gout. He is buried at St. James Church, Clerkenwell.

Organization The union operated directly under the Party of Labour of Albania, with its local organs supervised by the relevant district or city party committees. Founded in 1941, the union was considered one of the most important auxiliaries of the party. Organized in the same way as the party, the union had city and district committees, and higher organs, including the politburo and Central Committee. It was patterned after All- Union Leninist Communist Youth League, known as Komsomol, in the Soviet Union. = Membership = The more than 200,000 members of the union ranged in age from fifteen to twenty-five. The union was responsible for controlling all Pioneer organizations, which embraced children from seven to fourteen years of age; for implementing party directives among youth; and for mobilizing so- called volunteer labor brigades to work on special economic projects. Membership in the union was a prerequisite for those aspiring to a career in the party or state apparatus.

It consisted only of a list of acts and scenes; the details were left to the improvisation of the actors.

The spotlight fell on the actors rather than on the play itself. The use of improvisation on top of canovaccio enabled the avoidance of censorship because censors cannot censor that which is not written.

Legal issues On 26 February 2014, the Supreme Court of India ordered the detention of Roy for failing to appear before it in connection with legal dispute with Market Regulator - SEBI. In a statement after the arrest, his lawyer said Roy's 92-year-old mother was in poor health and needed \\"her eldest son\\" by her side, and hence he failed to appear at the court. As he failed to appear in the court during the ongoing legal battle, Roy was held in custody in the Tihar Jail, Delhi and is now out on parole since May 2016. Sahara was allowed to sell a part of its assets in India to raise part of the money in question. Initially he was granted interim bail by Supreme Court of India on 26 March 2014 on condition of depositing Rs 10,000 crore with the market regulator SEBI. His deposit of 10,000 crore has not been made. As of August 2014, Roy was trying to sell some of his hotel properties to raise enough money. Roy was granted his first bail in May 2017 for four weeks to perform the last rites for his deceased mother, later extended to 24 October. Since then he has been successful in getting his bail extended on various grounds. As of 31 January 2019, Sahara still had to pay Rs 10,621 crore to meet its total liability. Sahara claims that the company's fundamentals are intact and assets are greater than the liabilities. Sahara also claims that so far it has deposited more than 20,000 crores which will in due course of justice come back to Sahara India as it has already repaid 95% of its investors. The Securities And Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has repaid only Rs 64 crore to the investors since 2012. It is also been reported that Sahara has paid Rs 725.97 crore as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009‚Äì10 and 2012-13. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.

Early life Bob Layton was born on September 25, 1953.VIAF: \\"Layton, Bob\\" He learned to read comics from the age of four, explaining that his \\"older sister Sue became bored with reading the same comic to me about fifty times. (It was a Showcase featuring the Challengers of the Unknown.)\\" After leaving high school, Layton began \\"playing comics dealer ... selling them out of his apartment in Indianapolis,\\" through which he met Roger Stern in 1973, while the latter was working for a radio station in Indianapolis. Career =CPL= Layton and Stern began publishing a fanzine called CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature) out of Layton's apartment. Stern recalls that, \\"CPL started out as Bob's sale catalog. Bob was drawing the covers and including little reviews written by some of his customers. By issue #5, it turned into a small 'zine with a catalog insert, and I started writing short articles for it. I eventually became an editor of sorts.\\" CPL rapidly became a popular fan publication, and led to the two forming an alliance with Charlton Comics to produce and publish \\"the now-famous Charlton Bullseye magazine.\\" During the mid-1970s, both Marvel and DC were publishing in-house \\"fan\\" publications (F.O.O.M. and The Amazing World of DC Comics respectively), and Charlton wished to make inroads into the superhero market, as well as \\"establish a fan presence\\", leading to the alliance with CPL to produce the Charlton Bullseye. This led to Charlton giving Layton and Stern \\"access to unpublished material from their vaults by the likes of Steve Ditko, Jeff Jones and a host of others.\\" This association with Charlton (and Bill Pearson, production manager) in turn led to Layton becoming acquainted with the legendary Wally Wood, with whom he apprenticed.\\"All-Star Comments,\\" All-Star Comics #66 (May/June 1977). This apprenticeship led to work for Charlton on anthology titles, but not working from the Charlton offices, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, while still publishing fanzines. =Marvel Comics and DC Comics= Layton's first, albeit uncredited, work for Marvel Comics was inking a single page in the Marvel UK title The Avengers and the Savage Sword of Conan #135 (April 17, 1976). Part of Layton's role as Wally Wood's apprentice included him occasionally delivering artwork to \\"NYC from Connecticut.\\" Layton recalls that: Layton's reaction was one of panic, and his search for help to meet the deadline led him to Dick Giordano and Neal Adams' Continuity Associates where his \\"fledgling contemporaries,\\" the Crusty Bunkers (\\"Terry Austin, Bob Wiacek, Joe Rubinstein, Bob McLeod, Joe Brozowski, Carl Potts and a host of others\\") were able to lend a hand and help him finish the book. A month later, Layton received a package containing \\"an entire issue of pencils on the Champions\\", and discovered that he was \\"the new regular inker on the book.\\" He worked for Marvel \\"for about a year, then signed an exclusive one-year contract with DC ‚Äî after they made me 'an offer I couldn't refuse'.\\" Layton began work for DC Comics in early 1977, taking up regular inking duties on All Star Comics, as well as inking multiple issues of Secret Society of Super Villains, DC Super Stars, and DC Special, among others. In Nov./Dec. 1977, he inked the first issue of David Michelinie's Star Hunters, and after a number of other shorter inking jobs, moved back to Marvel in 1978, to ultimately take up one of his best remembered roles. In 1978, Layton reunited with Michelinie, to co-write Iron Man. The two would become regular creative partners, and began their collaboration on Iron Man with #116 (November 1978). Micheline and Layton established Tony Stark's alcoholism with the story \\"Demon in a Bottle\\", and introduced several supporting characters, including Stark's bodyguard girlfriend Bethany Cabe;Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 187: \\"In December [1978], co-plotters David Michelinie and Bob Layton, and penciler John Romita Jr. ... came up with Bethany Cabe, a highly capable professional bodyguard and a different sort of leading lady.\\" Stark's personal pilot and confidant James Rhodes, who later became the superhero War Machine;Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 188: \\"Writer David Michelinie and artists John Byrne and Bob Layton introduced James Rhodes Tony Stark's best friend and future super hero War Machine in The Invincible Iron Man #118.\\" and rival industrialist Justin Hammer,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 189: \\"Tony Stark's billionaire nemesis Justin Hammer made his first appearance in The Invincible Iron Man #120 by writer David Michelinie and artist John Romita Jr. and Bob Layton.\\" who was revealed to be the employer of numerous high-tech armed enemies Iron Man fought over the years.

Layton continued to ink and work on covers for titles such as The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Power Man and Iron Fist, and Micronauts. In September 1982, he launched one of Marvel's first limited series, writing and drawing the four-issue Hercules: Prince of Power.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 208: \\"Written and drawn by Bob Layton, Hercules, Prince of Power was a four-issue limited series set in the twenty-fourth century.\\" Its success spawned a four-issue sequel in 1984DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 216: \\"The first Hercules: Prince of Power limited series (1982) sold so well that writer/artist Bob Layton was commissioned to do another.\\" and a 1988 graphic novel (#37 in the \\"Marvel Graphic Novel\\" series) - Full Circle. Around this time, he designed the highly successful Marvel Secret Wars toy line for Mattel, which formed the impetus behind the 1984 Secret Wars event. Layton was one of the inkers on The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #18 (1984) which featured the wedding of Spider-Man supporting characters J. Jonah Jameson and Marla Madison in a story written by Stan Lee. In February 1986, Layton revived the original X-Men characters in the series X-Factor,DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 227: \\"Like many older fans, writer/artist Bob Layton longed for the good old days.

Layton wrote the first five issues before handing over the series to Louise Simonson. Michelinie and Layton became the creative team on Iron Man once again in issue #215 (Feb. 1987) They crafted the \\"Armor Wars\\" storyline which ran from #225 (Dec. 1987)DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 233: \\"Although actually called 'Stark Wars', the story arc that became known as 'Armor Wars began in this issue and ran until June 1988.\\" through #231 (June 1988). After Michelinie and Layton finished their second Iron Man run with issue #250, Layton returned to the title briefly to write and draw #254 and write #256 before leaving Marvel. A year later, he returned to the comics industry to ink Jim Shooter's Magnus, Robot Fighter #1, from Valiant Comics. =Valiant Comics= Bob Layton was one of the chief architects of the Valiant Universe, along with Jim Shooter, Barry Windsor-Smith, Steven J. Massarsky, and Jon Hartz. He co-created a number of the core characters including X-O Manowar, and later became Editor-in-Chief and Senior Vice President, during which time he controlled the company during its most profitable period. His first Valiant work appeared in Magnus, Robot Fighter #1 (May 1991), in which he inked Art Nichols' artwork from Jim Shooter's script. He would continue with Magnus for five issues and produce covers to issue #9, while inking the inaugural issues of Solar, Man of the Atom, which he edited. In February 1992, he co-created with Shooter and Steve Englehart and penciled the first issue of X-O Manowar, after which he handed over the core art duties to Sal Velluto, but provided inks for #2. The following month he drew the cover to David Michelinie's Rai In August 1992, he co-wrote, edited and inked Archer & Armstrong #1, edited and provided pencilwork on Eternal Warrior #1, and inked Barry Windsor-Smith on Unity #0. Starting in November 1992, he co-edited with Dark Horse publisher Mike Richardson the Predator/Magnus, Robot Fighter two-issue crossover, and in December was again inking and editing a Michelinie-written comic book series: H.A.R.D. Corps. Layton edited Turok, Dinosaur Hunter, Deathmate and Secret Weapons before writing the first of thirteen issues of The Second Life of Doctor Mirage. He was editing a vast array of titles during this time, for which he won the Editor of the Year award in 1993, as voted by the readers of the comics magazine, Wizard. His workload decreased greatly towards the end of 1994, in large part due to the sale of Valiant (Voyager Communications, Inc.) to video game giant Acclaim Entertainment for $65,000,000.00 USD, a deal in which Layton played an instrumental part. His story concepts and design work on Turok, Dinosaur Hunter was utilized to great effect by Acclaim when the video game became the largest selling title in Acclaim's history, with over 1.5 million units sold. He continued to work editorially, largely for the new Acclaim imprint Armada Comics, for which he edited a number of Magic: The Gathering comics during 1995-96. He edited Bob Hall's four-issue Armed & Dangerous (April‚ÄìJuly 1996), and returned to X-O Manowar for which he wrote the final three issues. After a several-year association with Valiant/Acclaim, Layton moved to Florida for a short retirement. Although he found time to write the first eleven (of twelve) issues of Acclaim's Doctor Tomorrow between 1997 and 1998, inking a couple of issues, notably #6 which was drawn by Dick Giordano, who resided in Florida as well and was something of a mentor to Layton. =Return to DC and Marvel= In 1998, he returned to DC, re-teaming briefly with penciler Sal Velluto on a story in September 1998's The New Gods Secret Files and Origins, before collabotaring with his fellow Floridian and artistic friend/mentor Dick Giordano on several projects. The two-issue prestige format Elseworlds tale Batman: Dark Knight of the Round Table was co- drawn and co-inked by the both of them, from a script by Layton and debuted a month after their six-issue mini-series The L.A.W. (Living Assault Weapons), which ran from September 1999 to February 2000, with script and inks by Layton, and full pencils by Giordano. The two wrote a second Batman Elseworlds tale, Batman: Hollywood Knight a three-issue mini-series which told the story of a Serials-actor who became convinced he was The Batman. It was written by Layton with pencils and inks by Giordano. Between Elseworlds, Layton worked with Marvel Comics on an Iron Man reunion, which saw him produce the four-part limited series Iron Man: Bad Blood with his long-term collaborator David Michelinie. The series ran from September to December 2000, with art by Layton and, as previously, the plot was a joint effort, and the final script by Michelinie. Layton then stayed at Marvel for a short time, teaming with Dan Jurgens as inker on Captain America (#38-50), as well as inking a short run on The Avengers (#44-47). He inked the Dan Jurgens-drawn The Power Company: Manhunter and part of Just Imagine Stan Lee ... Secret Files and Origins for DC in March 2002. =2000s= Layton in 2013 In December 2000, Layton launched Future Comics, with Dick Giordano, Allen Berrebbi, and David Michelinie. Layton acted as editor-in-chief, Berrebbi was CFO and director of marketing, Michelinie was head writer, Giordano was art director, and Skip Farrell was the publisher. Between 2000 and 2002, they prepared to revolutionize the direct market system by bypassing distributors and selling direct to customers and shops through the Internet. In August 2002, Freemind #0 was released. Edited and inked by Layton, written by Layton and Michelinie, and with pencils by Giordano, it was followed by another title, Metallix, before the company bowed to pressure and signed with distributor Diamond Comics Distribution in an attempt to maximize sales while maintaining their independent approach. Ultimately, after three titles the third was Deathmask, and seventeen total issues, the company was not making enough money to survive, and it folded, with one announced title ‚Äî Peacekeeper ‚Äî unpublished. Layton's work continues to be collected in multiple trade paperback collections. In 2006, he produced a number of variant covers to issues of Superverse Comics' Zoom Suit, written by John Taddeo, and in 2007 his work was featured in issues of Marvel's encyclopedic All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update. Layton worked for Marvel as a freelance artist and writer on several projects including the miniseries Iron Man: Legacy of Doom and Iron Man: The End. He continues to enjoy doing commission work, writing: Layton has been quoted as saying that he \\"miss[es] telling stories,\\" and to that end has showcased unpublished issues of Future Comics properties on his website, where he presented his serialized comic\\" Colony, with art by Giordano, and which \\"is a project that [Layton has] been developing for [over] 10 years and is currently making the rounds in Hollywood.\\" Other potential film deals for the Future Comics characters are reportedly semi-ongoing.

The canto () is a principal form of division in medieval and modern long poetry. The word canto is derived from the Italian word for \\"song\\" or \\"singing\\", which comes from the Latin cantus, \\"song\\", from the infinitive verb canere, \\"to sing\\".\\"Canto\\", The Merriam- Webster Dictionary. Retrieved 27 September 2015. The use of the canto was described in the 1911 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as \\"a convenient division when poetry was more usually sung by the minstrel to his own accompaniment than read\\". There is no specific format, construction or style for a canto and it is not limited to any one type of poetry. Some famous poems that employ the canto division are Dante's Divine Comedy (with 100 cantos), Cam√µes' Os Lus√≠adas (10 cantos), Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata (20 cantos), Byron's Don Juan (17 cantos, the last of which is unfinished) and Ezra Pound's The Cantos (116 cantos). The typical length of a canto varies greatly from one poem to another. The average canto in the Divine Comedy is 142 lines long, while the average canto in Os Lus√≠adas is 882 lines long.

Second cousin to the Shunzhi Emperor, Mingzhu came from an aristocratic line that belonged to the Plain Yellow Banner of the Eight Banners. His grandfather, Gintaisi, was the last prince of the Yehe Nara clan. In 1677, Mingju was named the Grand Secretary, one of the top-ranking positions, and became involved in a long power struggle with Songgotu throughout the middle years of Kangxi's reign. He was related to Consort Hui, one of the Kangxi Emperor's concubines who bore the emperor his first surviving son, Yinzhi. Consequently, he supported Yinzhi during the struggles for succession. He was sent to prison for corruption and various other charges in his final years. He married Ajige's fifth daughter and had at least three sons.

Under the provisions of the Texas Constitution, the lieutenant governor is president of the Texas Senate. Unlike with most other states' senates and the U.S. Senate, the lieutenant governor regularly exercises this function rather than delegating it to the president pro tempore or a majority leader. By the rules of the Senate, the lieutenant governor establishes all special and standing committees, appoints all chairpersons and members, and assigns all Senate legislation to the committee of his choice. The lieutenant governor decides all questions of parliamentary procedure in the Senate. He or she also has broad discretion in following Senate procedural rules. The lieutenant governor is an ex officio member of several statutory bodies. These include the Legislative Budget Board, the Legislative Council, the Legislative Audit Committee, the Legislative Board and Legislative Council, which have considerable sway over state programs, the budget and policy. The lieutenant governor is also a member of the Legislative Redistricting Board (together with the speaker of the House, attorney general, comptroller, and land commissioner), which is charged with adopting a redistricting plan for the Texas House of Representatives, Texas Senate, or U.S. House of Representatives after the decennial census if the Legislature fails to do so. In the case of a vacancy in the lieutenant governor's office, the Senate elects one of its members to act as President of the Senate until the next statewide office election, in effect becoming the lieutenant governor. A senator elected as presiding officer in this way retains his district seat and the voting privileges entailed with his Senate election. The lieutenant governor is sworn-in on the third Tuesday every four years, the same as the governor. Dan Patrick has been the lieutenant governor of Texas since January 20, 2015. The term of office was two years from 1846 to 1972. Voters then increased it to four years, effective for the 1974 election. The lieutenant governor assumes the powers of the governor of Texas when the governor is out of the state or otherwise unable to discharge the office. The lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor, rather than on the same ticket; it is therefore possible for the governor and lieutenant governor to be from different political parties (which was the case during Governor George W. Bush's first term and also during Bill Clements's two non-consecutive terms). The lieutenant governor becomes the governor if the elected governor resigns, dies or is removed from office via impeachment and conviction. Former governor Rick Perry took office upon George W. Bush's resignation on December 21, 2000. Bush became US President on January 20, 2001. When Perry became lieutenant governor on 19 January 1999, he became the first Republican since Albert Jennings Fountain in 1873 to serve as lieutenant governor, and the first Republican to be elected as Lieutenant Governor since James W. Flanagan in 1869. Compared to other lieutenant governors Texas is one of the few states that vests significant power in the office of lieutenant governor, making it among the most influential. By contrast, the lieutenant governor position in other states has few (if any) legislative responsibilities, akin to the vice president of the United States. The consequence is that the governor of Texas is weaker than other states' governors.
