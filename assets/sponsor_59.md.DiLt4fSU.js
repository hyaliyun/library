Three of the trawler's crew were killed, and the ship was subsequently damaged beyond repair after running aground. While the incident has been called a war crime, Allied submarines also conducted similar attacks during World War II. Background The Dureenbee was a fishing trawler of 223 tons displacement constructed in 1919. As of 1942, she belonged to Cam and Sons and operated in the seas off the South Coast of New South Wales. She was unarmed. Her crew comprised Captain William Reid and ten other men. Reid had served with the British Royal Navy during World War I. Two groups of Japanese submarines operated off the east coast of Australia in mid-1942. The first group arrived in May, and launched the Attack on Sydney Harbour on the 31st of the month. These submarines subsequently attacked merchant shipping until late June. A second group of three Japanese submarines comprising , and I-175 commenced operations in mid-July. I-175 departed the Japanese base at Kwajalein in the central Pacific on 8 July 1942 to operate off Australia. This would be the submarine's fourth war patrol; during the previous three she had mainly operated off Hawaii. The only ship sunk during these patrols was the small United States merchant vessel Mainini on 17 December 1941. The submarine also shelled Palmyra Naval Air Station on Palmyra Atoll on 24 December 1941. On 23 July I-175 torpedoed the Australian merchant vessel Allara off Newcastle. While the ship's crew abandoned ship, she did not sink and was towed into Newcastle. The next day the submarine torpedoed and damaged the Australian merchant vessel Murada north-east of Newcastle. On 26 July she was attacked by , and withdrew to the south. Two days later I-175 sank the French merchant vessel Cagou north-east of Newcastle, before proceeding south. Attack At about 1:30 am on 3 August Dureenbee accidentally approached I-175 during one of her fishing voyages. At this time the submarine was on the surface recharging its batteries. The trawler's crew were stowing recently-caught fish and dropping her net, and did not spot I-175. I-175 initiated the engagement by opening fire on Dureenbee with her deck gun. The first shell missed, and exploded in the sea. After realising the trawler was under attack, Dureenbees radio operator sent a distress signal. The submarine's crew then opened fire with machine guns, which destroyed the trawler's radio room and badly wounded the radio operator. Two more shells were fired at Dureenbee, with both striking the vessel. The shells destroyed the trawler's wheel house and crippled her engine, leaving the vessel motionless. Following the initial barrage Reid attempted to contact the Japanese sailors by yelling \\"don't fire! We are only a harmless fishing boat\\". This had no effect, and I-175 circled the trawler for 45 minutes. During this time her deck gun continued to fire on Dureenbee. The submarine then submerged, and reappeared six minutes later travelling out to sea. After I-175 disappeared, Reid fired several distress flares to summon assistance. At this time one member of the trawler's crew was dead, and another two seriously wounded. All of the other sailors had survived the attack with only minor injuries by sheltering behind machinery. Shortly after the attack on Dureenbee commenced, members of the Moruya Volunteer Defence Corps unit asked the co-owners of the trawler Mirrabooka and one of their crew to put to sea as a rescue vessel. They agreed, and departed the town at 2:30 am. At 6:20 am Dureenbee was spotted by a patrolling Royal Australian Air Force aircraft, which directed Mirrabooka towards her. Once Mirrabooka arrived alongside Dureenbee the damaged trawler's surviving crew and the body of the dead sailor were transferred across. One of the badly wounded sailors died on board Mirrabooka, and the third died in hospital several days later. Aftermath An attempt was made to locate and salvage Dureenbee on the morning of 4 August. Mirrabooka was also used for this task, having been commandeered by two members of the Commonwealth Salvage Board. Following a search, Dureenbee was found aground on rocks off the North Head of Batemans Bay. An attempt to tow Dureenbee off the rocks was unsuccessful, with Mirrabooka also nearly running aground and having to be rescued by the trawler Erina. No further attempts to recover Dureenbee were made, though local fishermen removed equipment from the wreck before it sank. Following the attack I-175 proceeded north, and took up a station to the south of Jervis Bay. On 7 August she was ordered to abandon her patrol off Australia to operate off San Cristobal in the Solomon Islands in response the United States landing on Guadalcanal that day. Five days later two US Navy aircraft attacked and damaged the submarine south-west of Espiritu Santo, forcing her to break off her patrol for repairs. She arrived at Rabaul on 17 August. The three members of Dureenbees who were killed in the attack were buried at Moruya Cemetery, with their graves being marked by Merchant Navy headstones. Six RAAF airmen killed during World War II are also buried in the cemetery. The remnants of the trawler still lie in the sea off what is now the Murramarang National Park. As of 2017, it was not a protected site. An account published during World War II labelled the attack on Dureenbee to have been \\"murder and piracy on the high seas\\". A postwar author has labelled it \\"barbarism\\". However, Allied submarines conducted many such attacks on Japanese fishing boats in the belief that they formed part of the Japanese war economy. In 2017 a local amateur historian noted that Dureenbees catch would have been used to feed Australian soldiers.

She is a professor emeritus of cognitive neuroimaging at the Aston Brain Centre, Aston University, Birmingham. Rippon has also sat on the editorial board of the International Journal of Psychophysiology. In 2019, Rippon published her book, Gendered Brain: The New Neuroscience that Shatters the Myth of the Female Brain, which investigates the role of life experiences and biology in brain development.  Career  = Researcher = Rippon gained her PhD in 1982 in physiological psychology and then focused on brain processes and schizophrenia. Rippon's research applies brain imaging techniques, particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and uses cognitive neuroscience paradigms to study normal and abnormal cognitive processes. Her work has also focused on Autistic Spectrum Disorders and to developmental dyslexia. = Gendered Brain = In 2019, Rippon released her book, Gendered Brain: The New Neuroscience that Shatters the Myth of the Female Brain.  Reviews  Reviews of Rippon's work have been \\"positive\\", according to review aggregator Book Marks, with three rave reviews, four positive, and three mixed reviews. In a review for Nature, neuroscientist Lise Elliot wrote that Rippon's book accomplishes its goal of debunking the concept of a gendered brain. Rhonda Voskuhl and Sabra Klein, of the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences, responded in Nature to Eliot's review, arguing against the idea that sex differences in behavior are due only to culture, and criticizing Eliot's claim that the brain is \\"no more gendered than the liver or kidneys or heart\\". They state that biological and cultural effects are not mutually exclusive, and that sex differences occur also in animals, who are not affected by culture. In a review for The Times, psychologist Simon Baron- Cohen stated that \\"most biologists and neuroscientists agree that prenatal biology and culture combine to explain average sex differences in the brain\\". He argues that Rippon \\"[boxes] herself into an extremist position by arguing that it‚Äôs all culture and no biology\\". Writing for The Guardian, Rachel Cooke writes that the book is a \\"brilliant debunking of the notion of a ‚Äòfemale brain‚Äô\\". In a mixed review at The New York Journal of Books, Jane Hale noted the book could be improved by finding \\"a social scientist to partner with\\".  Views  = Criticism of 'neurotrash' = Rippon is critical of what she sees as the misrepresentation and hijacking of neuroscience, what she calls 'neurotrash'. \\"The logic of their argument is that males and females are biologically different, men and women are behaviourally different, so their behavioural differences are biologically caused and cannot and, more importantly, should not be challenged or changed. I aim to... produce a guide to spotting such ‚Äòneurononsense‚Äô.\\" :Transcript of a lecture given at the British Science Festival, 18 September 2010. Neurotrashers, she says, \\"extrapolate wildly\\" from their data and believes that their science can be used for \\"social engineering\\" to reinforce perceived male and female roles and status. She says that neurotrashers perpetuate the idea \\"that biology is destiny. If you are biologically different that's it and if you fight against it in any particular way that's going to be damaging.\\" Rippon cites the work of Louann Brizendine as examples of neurotrash and has also criticized experiments done by Simon Baron-Cohen. = Sex differences in the brain = Rippon does not believe that there is a \\"single item type as a male brain or a female brain\\", instead that \\"everybody is actually made up of a whole pattern of things, which is maybe due to their biology and maybe due to their different experiences in life.\\" She puts forward the idea that \\"every brain is different from every other brain\\". Rippon is also opposed to the \\"continued emphasis on 'essentialist', brain-based explanations in both public communication of, and research into, many forms of gender imbalance.\\" When asked for a comparable \\"watershed\\" moment in science to compare her findings to, Rippon responded \\"the idea of the Earth circling around the sun\\". Rippon states that \\"I do think there are sex differences in the brain; there are bound to be, with respect to different roles in the reproductive process\\". She expanded that, when discussing brain differences, \\"there are sex differences that we should pay attention to, but the power that‚Äôs attributed to biology is what needs challenging\\".  Media appearances  Rippon appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme alongside professor Robert Winston and BBC's No More Boys And Girls: Can Our Kids Go Gender Free?. She was interviewed on the podcast NOUS on the publication of her book The Gendered Brain, where she responded to her critics.

Te Pahi was one of the senior chiefs of the north-western Bay of Islands. He was the son of Wharerau, a descendant of the ancient ancestral Ngati Awa, Nga Puhi, Ngati Rehia, and Te Hikutu and Ngati Rua. Te Atahoe lived at Te Puna in the Rangihoua Bay area of the Bay of Islands and was also known as Mary Bruce.Trade and Relations Maori in Parramatta 2015 Maarama Kamira, Parramatta City Council  Life  As a teenager, between 1806 and 1808, Te Atahoe was given in 'marriage' by her father to a former convict, English man, George Bruce. Bruce had been a crew member on a voyage from Sydney to New Zealand in 1806 during which Te Pahi had fallen ill and Bruce had cared for him. In 1807 Te Atahoe accompanied Bruce on the General Wellesley, a ship travelling to North Cape. However, the ship's captain, Captain Dalrymple, instead of returning the pair to the Bay of Islands, sailed for India via Malacca. Arriving in Malacca in December 1808, Bruce disembarked to lay a complaint about Dalrymple's behaviour, but while he was ashore Dalrymple left for Penang, with Te Atahoe on board. Bruce met the ship at Penang and the couple returned to Malacca to wait for a ship destined for New Zealand. As no ship was found, they instead sailed for Calcutta in late 1809, seeking a passage home. They found and joined the ship Union, which was sailing to Tasmania and then Sydney; only a few days after leaving Calcutta, Te Atahoe gave birth to a daughter, Mary. Te Atahoe contracted dysentery while in Sydney however, and died on 27 February 1810. Mary was placed with the Female Orphan School in Sydney and George Bruce returned to England, where he died in 1819 at the age of 40. Thomas Kendall and Samuel Marsden mention Mary in letters to the Church Missionary Society in 1815 and 1816 suggesting that Bruce tried to return to Sydney and his daughter Mary, but was denied entry to the colony by Governor Macquarie. In 1816 Kendall wrote \\"George Bruce, whom you mention in your letter would not in my opinion do any good here. The woman he cohabited is dead. The child is in the Orphan School at Sydney. It is better provided for that he could provide for it.\\"Pratt to Kendall 16 August 1815, Kendal to Pratt 6 Dec 1816 There is some suggestion that having Mary at the Orphan School meant that she, as a high ranking granddaughter of a senior Maori Chief, could possibly be used as collateral if hostilities broke out between the Port Jackson traders and Maori in the Bay of Islands and Hokianga regions. She was the granddaughter of Te Pahi and the niece of Ruatara, Kawiti and Hongi Hika, all Chiefs in their own right and seminal trading partners to the colony. Mary was one of the first orphans at the new Female Orphan School at Parramatta, now the Whitlam Centre, Western Sydney University. She became a teacher at the school and in 1828 married a former convict, James Tucker; Samuel Marsden officiated at the ceremony, at St Johns Church, Parramatta.Maori Trade and Relations in Parramatta 2015 Maarama Kamira Parramatta City Council Te Atahoe was buried at the Old Sydney Burial Ground which is now the site of Sydney Town Hall. When construction began on the Town Hall, she was exhumed and taken to Haslams Creek, which became Rookwood Necropolis. Her death notice was placed in the Sydney Gazette on 3 March 1810 and states that she died at 4am in the home of a Frances McKuen.Sydney Gazette 3 March 1810 Page 2 Her headstone read \\"Sacred to the memory of Mary Bruce, a Princess of New Zealand who departed this life Feb 27 1810.

Searching for Junnu, he goes to a music stall and starts playing the same tune they created during childhood. Junnu, hearing the song, desperately runs searching for him but cannot find him. Avinash finds the hundred rupee note with Junnu's phone number on it, and dials the number repeatedly, but Junnu/Priya cuts the call repeatedly as she is also calling searching for the tune player's location in the fest. She finally picks up the call, speaks with him, but Avinash's mobile runs out of battery. He now knows that Junnu is also in the music festival. He visits the music stall again where Junnu had played earlier and plays one final time. Hearing the tune, Priya/Junnu runs around looking for the player. Stunned by seeing Junnu with a desperate look, Avinash murmurs, identifying Junnu followed by sign of her saying yes, and they both embrace each other in love.

The post holder was chiefly responsible for the command of the navy's fleet that operated in the North Sea and off the English coast out of Yarmouth from 1294 to 1412.  History  The origins of the office Admiral of the North dates back to 1294 with the appointment of John de Botetourt. The office was known by different names from its inception, such as Admiral of the North and Admiral on the Yarmouth Station (1294‚Äì1325), Admiral of the North Sea, Admiral of the Northern Squadron and Admiral North, of the Thames with the exception of the office of Admiral of all the Fleets about England between 1360 and 1364 and the creation of the office of Admiral of England from 1385 to 1388 according to Ehrman \\"During the fourteenth centuries this office grew rapidly in importance\\" it was one of the two Admiralty's that existed at this time, and in 1412 this office along with the Admiralty of the West was amalgamated into a single office Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine. It was considered the most important naval command in the English Navy from the late 13th century until the beginning of the 15th century. The first royal commission as Admiral to a naval officer was granted in 1303. By 1344 it was only used as a rank at sea for a captain in charge of a fleet or fleets. :Rank and Role The naval defence of England from the end of the 13th century was divided into regional commands or 'admiralties' until the end of the fourteenth Century. The appointment of an admiral was not regarded by the English government at the time as an honorary post subordinate to a military rank, their importance attached to their office can be confirmed by the recording of their allowances paid recorded in the Calendar of Patent Rolls. In the fourteenth Century Admirals were paid a respectable salary which was only granted because the position was viewed as substantially important. In addition the rank of admiral was only granted to men of high prestige within feudal hierarchy, most recipients of the office were usually knights but more often earls.Rodger pp. 131-142 The Admirals duties usually consisted of assembling fleets for naval expeditions undertaken by the monarch on campaign, maintaining order and discipline and supervising the work of the Admiralty Courts for each region. On major military expeditions the Admiral would go to sea with their fleets and accompany the overall Commander-in-Chief of both sea and land forces usually the King himself but sometimes a nobleman of higher rank than the admiral. Their role was to observe and direct naval battles but not necessarily taking part in them, themselves. However, from 1344 onward their role was moving from primarily an administrative one to that of a seagoing command.National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy In 1337 the first known record of the appointment of a \\"vice-admiral' was granted to a Nicholas Ususmaris, a Genoese, he was made Vice-Admiral of the King's fleet of galleys, and all other ships of Aquitaine. However these appointments were far and few between. There was two further instances of the appointment of Vice- Admirals to Sir Thomas Drayton as Vice-Admiral of the Northern Fleet and Sir Peter Bard Vice-Admiral of the Western Fleet both on 28 July 1338. Special assistants were appointed to handle two important sub-divisions of the admirals powers. The first was the admiral's lieutenant, or deputy sometimes referred to as sub-admirals, who handled administrative and legal duties and each of these admirals had one and often retained more knowledge than the Admiral himself in relation to the sea and coastal communities. It would not be until the early 15th century that they would appointed on a more regular basis however they were referred to at this time as the admirals Lieutenant- General this office eventually became known as the Lieutenant of the Admiralty. The second was the Wardens of the Coast for each region who were responsible for the direction and co-ordination of the fleet, the equipping of boats and processing payments to sailors and superintendence of the Sea Guard Militia assigned to each coastal county. From the mid fourteenth century there was a move to centralise these regional naval authorities as seen with the appointment of the Admiral of the Southern, Northern and Western fleets sometimes referred to as Admiral of the Fleet or Admiral of England and the Admiral of the North and West this tendency towards unifying regional naval authorities under one admiral eventually led to the creation of the office of the Lord-Admiral of England The Admirals were logistically supported by the Clerk of the Kings Ships who looked after all the navy's finances whilst victualling of the navy was handled by another one of Kings Clerks. Office Holders Notes:The British Naval Historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger in his book the Safeguard of the Sea (2004) lists only officers that were appointed to this office and also took part in particular campaigns and not those that were officially appointed Admiral of the North, but their appointments were cancelled at the start of a campaign. :Included: * Admiral Sir John de Botetourt, 1st Baron Botetourt, (1295 ‚Äì 1296). * Admiral Sir Edward Charles, (1306 ‚Äì 1307). * Admiral Sir John Sturmy and Sir Peter Bard, (1314 ‚Äì 1315).

It was shortlisted as one of the three films to be selected as the potential Spanish submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards. However, it was not selected, with Summer 1993 being selected as the Spanish entry. Plot Carmen (Verd√∫) is married to Carlos (De la Torre), a rude, emotionally abusive construction worker who barely pays any attention to his wife and teenage daughter. One night, during a family party, Carlos pretends to offer himself for the act of Carmen's cousin, supermarket security guard and amateur hypnotist Pepe (Mota), but he instead crashes Pepe's performance as his idea of a joke. However, he ends up unexpectedly affected by the hypnosis, to the point of holding Pepe hostage with a knife for a moment while everybody believe he is still joking. From the next day onwards, Carlos starts having lapses of time where he shows a very different personality, behaving like a loving, charismatic and intelligent man. Shocked yet gradually delighted, Carmen welcomes this change, but she starts suspecting there is something sinister behind it when Carlos's second personality suffers brief but dangerous episodes of psychosis. She enlists the aid of Pepe and his hypnotism teacher, odontologist Dr. Fumetti (Pou), and together discover the truth: Carlos had sleeping mediumnic abilities, and the failed hypnosis act caused a dead man's soul to forge a spiritual link with him, possessing him at several moments. After investigating further, Carmen and Pepe eventually find out the identity of the dead man, a dancing prodigy named Tito (Guti√©rrez) who suffered from schizophrenia and murdered his own mother before committing suicide 15 years before. His identity is further proved in a club, in which Carlos dances spectacularly with Carmen to Steve Miller Band's \\"Abracadabra\\" song. Carmen, Pepe and Dr. Fumetti hold a s√©ance through the body of a dying old man to try to convince Tito to leave Carlos alone, but the spirit refuses on the claim to be in love with Carmen. The latter impulsively drives Dr. Fumetti away when he tries to destroy the spirit by killing the old man, which would have killed Carlos too. Time passes, and Carmen is left conflicted about what to do, while the Tito-possessed Carlos becomes increasingly unhinged due to his constant psychotic visions of chimpanzees tormenting him. At his new job as a steward, Tito suffers a breakdown while working on wedding, and only the arrival of Carmen and Pepe impedes him from possibly murdering the entire restaurant with a knife. In order to solve the situation once for all, Pepe pretends to be an entertainer and celebrates an impromptu hypnotism act for the guests, which he uses to send both Tito and Carmen to the bottom of Carlos's mind. Here she finds the mental representations of both men, equally pleading for her to allow them to take over the body. She faces a difficult decision, but despite seeming willing to accept the charming Tito over the brutish Carlos, she suddenly stabs Tito with the mental representation of the knife, sending his soul to the afterlife for good. After waking up, Carlos tries to make up with her for his failures as a husband and father, but she ignores him and leaves silently the restaurant, implying she has decided to abandon him and seek a better life.

Life  The daughter of Julius Perzina and Emmi Ehrlich von Treuenst√§tt, Maria Perzina was born in Reichenberg, at that time a major commercial and industrial city in Austrian northern Bohemia (and known after 1945 as Liberec in Czechoslovakia). She grew up in Vienna where she attended a teacher training college, which she left in 1892. Around this time she married Konrad Hoheisel, a talented and ambitious official in the imperial postal service, and the couple moved to Trieste in connection with Konrad's work. In 1907 Konrad's work caused them to relocate to Linz. In 1910 her husband was moved again, taking the couple, accompanied by this time by their two children Konrad and Emmi, back to Vienna where by 1918 Konrad Hoheisel had become national General Director for posts and telecommunications. While they were living in Linz Marie Hohenheisel began working to improve living conditions for women. She concerned herself with wage levels and working conditions and also demanded better status and recognition by society for the work undertaken by women as wives and mothers. From her published articles and lectures/speeches from those years it is evident that her over-riding goal was legislative backing for the equal standing of men and women in the workplace and in society. In Vienna, supported by the pioneering feminist activist Marianne Hainisch, from 1926 she focused on the campaign to introduce a US-style Mother's Day to the country. In 1928 she became chair of the Austrian Mothers' Day committee. Three years later she also took on the presidency of the League of Austrian Women's Associations (\\"Bund √ñsterreichischer Frauenvereine\\" / B√ñF), a position she retained till the League's dissolution in 1938 following the 1938 merger (\\"Anschluss\\"\\") of Austria into Nazi Germany. In 1934 Hoheisel was also elected to the national committee of the \\"Women's Emergency Services\\" (\\"Frauen- Notdienst\\"). She also took a leading role in the Austrian (\\"Consumers' League\\") \\"Konsumentenliga\\". In 1937 an article that she contributed to a specialist journal entitled \\"Food price inflation, dual income legislation and their impact on socio-political issues\\" (\\"Lebensmittelteuerung und Doppelverdienergesetz und ihre bev√∂lkerungspolitischen Folgen\\") dealt with themes that are as important today as they were in 1937. At the time of the \\"Anschluss\\" Hoheisel was in her mid-60s. She lost or surrendered from her public appointments and for most purposes disappears from the public record. She died in Vienna in 1947.  Significance  By a circuitous route, papers comprising Marie Hoheisel's \\"literary legacy\\" came into the possession of the Vienna Public Library and were transferred to the public archives at the City Hall in 2013. The resulting archive incorporates approximately 500 hand- written and typed documents that she produced, mostly during the period 1928-1936. Along with texts by Hoheisel, the archive contains written material from other feminist activist of the time, providing insights into the workings of the feminist network in Austria and internationally. The public accessibility of the archive has opened the way to a wider appreciation of a women's rights activists whose contribution had been largely overlooked during the Nazi years and in the turmoil generated by the war and its politically charged aftermath.

Doreen was also one of the founders of the organisation now called the Pagan Federation, which, more than 40 years on, continues to represent modern day pagans in mainstream society in areas such as law, government, hospitals, schools and the wider community.

The Doreen Valiente Collection The Doreen Valiente Collection, owned by the,Doreen Valiente Foundation Registered Charity No. 1178528 in England and Wales, a Registered Charity No. 1178528 in England and Wales, is probably the most significant collection in the world of original artifacts and documents related to the twentieth century rise of modern-day witchcraft (‚ÄúWicca‚Äù) which paved the way for the development of awareness and cultural acceptance of modern-day interpretations of paganism into society. The latter part of the millennium saw underground indigenous British religious and spiritual traditions become worldwide phenomena and begin to take their place in mainstream society, the 2011 census showed Paganism as Britain's seventh largest faith group. As the author of some of the religious texts that are used in modern-day Wicca, the Doreen Valiente Collection naturally contains a number of these original manuscripts. Doreen Valiente was an inveterate collector of material relating to folklore, witchcraft and other allied interests. Nearly all of the witchcraft-related material, which she accumulated, passed to John Belham-Payne upon her death.

Iran Front Page online, April 19, 2017. Text The poem comes from Saadi's book the Gulistan or Golestan (chapter 1, story 10), completed in 1258 AD. : : : : : : : : : The literal translation of the above is as follows: :\\"Human beings are members of a whole, :since in their creation they are of one essence. :When the conditions of the time brings a member (limb) to pain, :the other members (limbs) will suffer from discomfort. :You, who are indifferent to the misery of others, :it is not fitting that they should call you a human being.\\" Another translation (adopting the variant reading for ), is as follows: :\\"Adam's children are limbs of one body :That in creation are made of one gem. :When life and time hurt a limb, :Other limbs will not be at ease. :You who are not sad for the suffering of others, :Do not deserve to be called human.\\" Context of the poem Shrine of John the Baptist in the Umayyad Mosque. The poem comes in the Gulistan at the end of story 10 of the 1st chapter, which is titled \\"On the Conduct of Kings\\". In this story Saadi claims to have been praying at the tomb of John the Baptist in the Great Mosque in Damascus, when he gave advice to an unnamed Arab king who requested Saadi to add his prayers to his own as he was afraid of a powerful enemy. Saadi's advice to the king was that if he wished to live a life free of fear of retribution he should rule his people with justice. He reinforces his advice with two short poems, the second of which is Bani Adam. There seems no reason to doubt that Saadi may have visited Damascus in his travels, although this particular incident, like many of Saadi's stories, may of course be fictional.Paul Losensky: Sa'di (Encyclopaedia Iranica). \\"Although Sa ødi‚Äôs own writings, especially the BustƒÅn and GolestƒÅn, contain many purportedly autobiographical reminiscences, a good number of these are historically implausible and are probably fictionalized or cast in the first-person for rhetorical effect.\\" The story is quoted below in the version completed in 1888 and published in 1928 under the name of Richard Francis Burton, but probably in fact by the Hungarian linguist Edward Rehatsek:J. D. Yohannan (1950). \\"Did Sir Richard Burton Translate Sadi's Gulistan?\\". The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 3/4 (Oct., 1950), pp. 185-188. :Story 10 :I was constantly engaged in prayer, at the head of the prophet Yahia's tomb in the cathedral mosque of Damascus, when one of the Arab kings, notorious for his injustice, happened to arrive on a pilgrimage to it, who offered his supplications and asked for compliance with his needs. ::The dervish and the plutocrat are slaves on the floor of this threshold ::And those who are the wealthiest are the most needy. :Then he said to me: 'Dervishes being zealous and veracious in their dealings, unite thy mind to mine, for I am apprehensive of a powerful enemy.' I replied: 'Have mercy upon thy feeble subjects that thou mayest not be injured by a strong foe.' ::With a powerful arm and the strength of the wrist ::To break the five fingers of a poor man is sin. ::Let him be afraid who spares not the fallen ::Because if he falls no one will take hold of his hand. ::Whoever sows bad seed and expects good fruit ::Has cudgelled his brains for nought and begotten vain imaginations. ::Extract the cotton from thy ears and administer justice to thy people ::And if thou failest to do so, there is a day of retribution. ::‚Äì ::The sons of Adam are limbs of each other ::Having been created of one essence. ::When the calamity of time afflicts one limb ::The other limbs cannot remain at rest. ::If thou hast no sympathy for the troubles of others ::Thou art unworthy to be called by the name of a man. Variant readings The first line of the poem is quoted in two different versions, one with \\"one another\\" and the other with \\"one body\\". Both readings have their supporters. =In favour of = The variant of the poem containing the word \\"one another\\" is the form more usually quoted in Iran. It is the version found in the standard edition of the Gulistan edited by Mohammad Ali Foroughi, on the Internet on the Persian Literature website,Gulistan 1.10 (Ganjoor website) . and woven on the Persian carpet presented to the United Nations in New York in 2005.United Nations press release. In 2010 the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran issued a containing the first couplet of the poem, also with the version. In a statement issued at the time in response to a controversy in the press about the choice of version, the bank said that they had chosen this version after consultation with experts at the Academy of Persian Language and Literature.Mehr News article, 1 Tir 1389 (22 June 2010) (in Persian).IBNA News Agency article, 31 Ordibehesht 1397 (21 May 2018) (in Persian). Among statements issued by experts at the time of the issue of the banknote, Professor Kavoos Hasanli of the University of Shiraz, the author of a book on Saadi, was quoted as saying that is closer to the construction and grammar of Persian in Saadi's time and therefore more trustworthy. Later, however, in another statement he revised his view to say that although is more grammatical and closer to the language of Saadi, he believed that since this version is not found in the early manuscripts, it is not the original one.Central Bank press release, 8 Tir 1389 (29 June 2010) (in Persian). The variant is also favoured by Mohammad Jafar Yahaghi of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature, and was also supported by the late Professors Mojtaba Minovi and . The version with is said to be found in all the early manuscripts, dating to within 60 years of the composition of the Gulistan. The scholar wrote: \\"Twenty years ago when I was assisting the late Mohammad Ali Foroughi in preparing the 2nd edition of his collected works of Saadi, we had available some very old and reliable manuscripts, dating from 717 (1317-8 AD) and 724 (1324 AD) and later. In all these copies the poem appeared in the form banƒ´ ƒÅdam a'zƒÅye yekdƒ´gar-and.\\" Mehr News article, 6 Tir 1389 (27 June 2010) (in Persian). =In favour of = However, despite the lack of manuscript support, other scholars have argued for the correctness of the variant . Among these was Saeed Nafisi, himself the author of an edition of the Gulistan (1962), who pointed out that in the ta'liq style of handwriting used in Saadi's time, the expressions and would have looked almost identical.Rasoul Ghorbani, Rahpardakht, 1 Khordad 1397 (22 May 2018) (in Persian, with illustration).article by Seyyed Abdolreza Mousavi Tabari (in Persian). Another scholar who supported the reading yek peykar was the famous blind teacher , on the grounds that \\"members of one body\\" was not only more logical, but also closer to the hadith cited above, on which the poem is based.article by Ali Saki, Golvani News Agency, 11.3.1397 (1 June 2018) (in Persian). It may be noted that although the carpet in the United Nations has the version woven into it, the English translation by Edward Eastwick on the plaque alongside it quoted in a speech by Ban Ki-moon (see below) \\"All human beings are members of one frame\\" translates the other version with yek peykar. The word has a wide range of meanings: \\"image\\", \\"figure\\", \\"effigy\\", \\"likeness\\", \\"statue\\", \\"icon\\", \\"body\\".Google translate.Wictionary: Ÿæ€å⁄©ÿ±. Before Saadi's time it was most famously used by Nizami Ganjavi in his poem Haft Peykar (\\"The Seven Portraits\\")Fran√ßois de Blois: Haft Peykar (Encyclopaedia Iranica). of 1197, the story of King Bahram, who finds portraits of seven princesses in a locked room. In other contexts, however, such as ghazal 595.6, where Saadi writes of his \\"feeble body\\" (), the translation \\"body\\" is appropriate.Saadi, Ghazal 595 (Ganjoor website). Metre The prose stories of the Gulistan are illustrated with short poems in a large variety of different metres. Three different metres are used in Story 10. The first couplet is in the 13-syllable ruba'i metre (3.3.13 and 5.1.13 in Elwell-Sutton's classificationElwell-Sutton, L.P. (1986). Ar≈´z (Encyclopaedia Iranica).); the second poem, of four couplets, is in the 15-syllable metre known as (4.1.15), often used for lyric poetry. The third poem, Bani Adam, is in the well-known 11-syllable (mutaqƒÅrib) metre (1.1.11), which is also used for Ferdowsi's Shahnameh and for Saadi's long poem the Bustan. Although it has an Arabic name, it is likely that this metre is originally Persian and not derived from any Arabic metre.Elwell-Sutton, L.P. (1975). \\"The Foundations of Persian Prosody and Metrics\\". Iran, vol 13. The metre is usually used as here in the form of rhyming couplets. The pattern of the metre is as follows (where \\"u\\" is a short syllable, and \\"‚Äì\\" a long one), reading from left to right: :u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì Monotony is avoided by variation in the position of the word accents, and by the occasional use of \\"overlong\\" syllables such as r≈´z and ozv- in the third and fourth lines, which are prolonged and occupy the time of a long plus a short syllable:Elwell- Sutton, L.P. (1976). The Persian Metres. Cambridge University Press., p. 214. : : Thus these two lines have only 10 syllables instead of the usual 11. United Nations connection The first Iranian representative to the League of Nations (the predecessor of the United Nations) from 1928 to 1930 was Mohammad Ali Foroughi, the editor of Saadi's works.For≈´gƒ´, Mohammad Ali (Encyclopedia Iranica). In a speech made in Paris in 1929, Foroughi described how at a banquet of the League of Nations in Geneva in September 1928, an Albanian representative (who had apparently learnt Persian when Albania was still part of the Ottoman Empire) had made the suggestion that Saadi's poem would make a good motto for the organisation.Seyyed Abdolreza Mousavi Tabari, quoting the account of the 1929 conference published in the book JƒÅme'e-ye Melal (Soci√©t√© des Nations) (1930), pp. 10-11 (in Persian). It seems that the suggestion was not taken up, but for many years it was rumoured in Iran that Saadi's poem had been inscribed over the entrance to the United Nations headquarters, either in New York or in Geneva. Later, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007, described how he searched both locations in vain, and could find no trace of any such inscription. It was during Zarif's time, however, that Mohammad Seirafian, the owner of a famous carpet workshop in Isfahan, let it be known that he had a large 5 metre by 5 metre carpet containing Saadi's poem woven into it in gold letters, which he was willing to offer to the United Nations as a gift. This carpet was eventually installed in 2005 in a meeting hall in the interior of the United Nations headquarters in New York, where it shares a wall with a Chinese carpet. The eighth Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, mentioned the carpet and quoted Saadi's poem in a speech made in Tehran in 2012 in these words:Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Tehran (Iran), 30 August 2012 :\\"There is a magnificent carpet ‚Äì I think the largest carpet the United Nations has ‚Äì that adorns the wall of the United Nations, a gift from the people of Iran. Alongside it are the wonderful words of that great Persian poet, Sa‚Äôadi: ::All human beings are members of one frame, ::Since all, at first, from the same essence came. ::When time afflicts a limb with pain ::The other limbs at rest cannot remain. ::If thou feel not for other‚Äôs misery ::A human being is no name for thee.\\" The translation quoted by Ban Ki-moon, which is the same as that on the plaque on the wall of the United Nations commemorating the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations (2001), is taken from the second edition (1880) of the translation of the Gulistan by Edward Eastwick.Eastwick, E.B. Gulistan (1880 edition). (The first edition (1852) has slightly different wording: \\"All Adam's race are members of one frame\\".) The sentiment of Saadi's poem can be seen to conform to the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948,Universal Declaration of Human Rights of which the first article reads as follows: :\\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\\" Cultural references The poem was featured as one of Coldplay's songs (also called \\"ÿ®ŸÜ€å ÿ¢ÿØŸÖ\\") on their album Everyday Life released in November 2019.

History and description In 1989 the city decided to ensure that the Aarschotse Bruine, a typical Flemish Red-Brown beer of the wider Aarschot countryside, was being brewed again after the last local brewer ceased trading in 1969. Before that year many local brewers made the beer but take-overs and consolidation of the market caused them to cease brewing. In 2012 the city governors decided to support the initiative of the tourist board and make the barn of the culture centre Het Gasthuis available for conversion to a brewery.

It was fought between the forces of the Clan Stewart of Appin and their allies the Clan MacLaren against the Clan MacDougall and the Clan MacFarlane. The latter force may have included men from the Clan Campbell. Background In 1463 John Stewart, Lord of Lorne, was murdered at Dunstaffnage Castle by Alan MacCaul, or MacDougall, and his supporters. As a result, the right of John Stewart's son, Dugald Stewart, to succeed was disputed. Over the next few years Dugald lost the title of Lord of Lorne through the treachery of his uncle Walter Stewart and also the Lord of Argyll. However, he had retained Appin and Lismore, and consolidated his power and fortified the hunting lodge which later became Castle Stalker on the Cormorant's Rock in Loch Liach. His clan also kept up regular raids on the Campbell territory that surrounded Appin. Battle In 1468 the feud culminated in the bloody Battle of Stalc. Colin Campbell and Walter Stewart had organized a massive raid against Dugald Stewart and his clan. Alan MacCaul (or MacDougall) was also involved. Dugald Stewart gathered his men, and as the enemy approached he sent his men out along a ridge, which gave him the advantage of ground. Although Dugald lost many men, he virtually destroyed the military strength of the MacFarlanes, which they never recovered from. 130 of the MacLarens also fell in the battle. Alan MacDougall, or MacCaul, murderer of John Stewart, was killed in the battle, apparently by Dugald himself. However, according to 21st-century historian Walter MacDougall, it is not entirely clear what happened to Alan MacCaul (MacCoul), but if he did die in the battle that the Scottish Gaelic name of the place where the fight took place, \\"Lagna an Phail\\", which translates as \\"treacherous hollow\\", was a fitting place for his final moments. Aftermath In the autumn of 1469, Dugald Stewart gave up his claim to Lorne to his uncle, Walter Stewart, in order to hold Appin. However, the battle had solidified Dugald's claim to Appin and the surrounding area, and it was formally granted to him by James III of Scotland on 14 April 1470. However, Dugald was later killed in battle in 1497 or 1498 fighting against the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, at the Battle of Black Mount.

Overview  ISO 15118 is one of the International Electrotechnical Commission's group of standards for electric road vehicles and electric industrial trucks, and is the responsibility of Joint Working Group 1 (JWG1 V2G) of IEC Technical Committee 69 (TC69)IEC Technical Committee 69 together with subcommittee 31 (SC31)ISO technical committee 22 subcommittee 31 of the International Organization for Standardization's Technical Committee 22 (TC22)ISO technical committee 22 on road vehicles. The user-convenient and secure Plug & Charge feature that comes with ISO 15118 enables the electric vehicle to automatically identify and authorize itself to the charging station on behalf of the driver to receive energy for recharging its battery. The only action required by the driver is to plug the charging cable into the EV and/or charging station. Some of the networks using the standard are Electrify America.  Standard documents  ISO 15118 consists of the following parts, detailed in separate standard documents: * ISO 15118-1: General information and use-case definition * ISO 15118-2: Network and application protocol requirements * ISO 15118-3: Physical and data link layer requirements * ISO 15118-4: Network and application protocol conformance test * ISO 15118-5: Physical and data link layer conformance test * ISO/DIS 15118-6: General information and use-case definition for wireless communication (out of commission, merged with 2nd edition of ISO 15118-1) * ISO/CD 15118-7: Network and application protocol requirements for wireless communication (out of commission, moved to ISO/DIS 15118-20) * ISO 15118-8: Physical layer and data link layer requirements for wireless communication *ISO 15118-20: 2nd generation network and application protocol requirements  Use of ISO 15118 in heavy duty vehicles  The ISO 15118 is also used as communication protocol for charging of heavy duty vehicles as: * Harbor Automated Guided Vehicles https://www.globalpsa.com/assets/uploads/nr160620.pdf * Public transportation https://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2017/04/Highlights-2016-Electric- transport-in-the-Netherlands-RVO.nl_.pdf When using the ISO 15118 in a commercial operation the use of WLAN (ISO 15118-8) must be considered carefully since there is no way to guarantee operation uptime when using wireless communication based on WLAN .

As they were trying to build a fortress in Mindouos, the Byzantines were defeated by the Sasanian army.Conor Whately, Battles and Generals: Combat, Culture, and Didacticism in Procopius, 2006, Netherlands, p.238 Belisarius managed to flee but the Sasanians destroyed the buildings. Despite their victory, the Persians suffered heavy losses, angering Kavadh I, the Sasanian king of Persia. Background After the death of the emperor Justin I in 527, his successor Justinian I was determined to continue the war against the Sassanid Empire. He appointed Belisarius as magister militum of the East and put him in charge of strengthening the Byzantine positions and building a new fortress near Dara to protect the region from Persian raids. Thannuris appeared to be a convenient place for a city and a military force to be stationed but the current fort was vulnerable. He began firstly by overseeing the strengthening of the fortifications.Zachariah of Mitylene, Syriac Chronicle (1899). Book 9. Battle At the same time, a Persian army under prince Xerxes with 30,000 men invaded Mesopotamia. Perceiving the threat, other Byzantine units and Ghassanid allies joined the forces of Belisarius to protect Roman workers undertaking the construction of the fort. As the building operations were progressing, the Persian army rose up. Despite the Byzantine efforts, the Persians managed to close up to the walls and breach them.Zachariah of Mitylene, Syriac Chronicle (1899). Book 9 Belisarius tried to counter-attack with his cavalry but was defeated and ordered to withdraw to Dara. The exact course of the Persian campaign is poorly recorded in primary sources, which have often compressed the events of the battles of Thannuris and Mindouos into one. In the narrative that portrays them as separate battles, the battle of Thannuris took place before Mindouos, and is depicted as the Persians luring the Roman infantry into a trap where they fell into deep holes and were killed or captured. The end of the battle was disastrous for the Byzantine army. Belisarius and the cavalry escaped, but two commanders were killed and three captured. Jabalah IV ibn al-Harith, ruler of the Ghassanids, who fought under Belisarius' command as a Byzantine vassal, fell from his horse and was killed by the Persians.Greatrex, Geoffrey; Lieu, Samuel N. C. (2002). The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (Part II, 363‚Äì630 AD). London, United Kingdom: Routledge. , p85. Coutzes's fate is uncertain. Procopius writes that he was taken prisoner and never seen again, while Zacharias of Mytilene records that he was killed.Martindale, John Robert; Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin; Morris, J., eds. (1992). The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Volume III: A.D. 527‚Äì641. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. . Aftermath After the battle, the foundations of the new fortress were left in the hands of the Persians who then began to destroy them. The Byzantine army retreated to Dara, but some of the infantry died of thirst on the march.Zachariah of Mitylene, Syriac Chronicle (1899). Book 9 Despite their victory, the Persians suffered heavy losses and then retreated behind the frontier. In particular, the loss of 500 Immortals from the Imperial Guard, made the king of Persia Kavadh I angry. Despite his victory, the general Xerxes was disgraced shortly after the battle by Kavadh I.Greatrex, Geoffrey; Lieu, Samuel N. C. (2002). The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (Part II, 363‚Äì630 AD). London, United Kingdom: Routledge. . The Byzantine emperor Justinian sent additional troops to reinforce the border fortresses of Amida, Constantia, Edessa, Sura and Beroea. He also raised a new army which was placed under the command of Pompeius, but a severe winter interrupted further operations until the end of the year. Belisarius would later be accused to incompetence because of this battle and the one later fought at Callinicum but all charges against him were cleared by an inquiry. According to Irfan Shahid, the Persians adopted the tactic of using trenches from the Hephthalites in the disastrous war of 484. Belisarius subsequently adopted it from the Persians and used it at the Battle of Dara two years later, and Muhammad also somehow adopted it from the Persians‚Äîpossibly via the Ghassanid Arabs who saw their king killed at Thannuris‚Äîand used it at the Battle of the Ditch a hundred years later. =Battle of Mindouos= It has been argued that the battle of Mindouos is a separate battle taking place shortly after the battle of Thannuris instead of being one event.

Huling published The Bookseller and edited numerous newsletters, among them Social Progress, The Stylus, and The Sentinel. She also wrote two novels, The Courage of Her Convictions (1896) and Letters of a Business Woman to Her Niece. Early life and family Caroline Augusta Alden Huling was born in Saratoga Springs, New York, on April 2, 1856. Her father was Edmund James Huling (1820‚Äì1891), editor and publisher in Saratoga Springs. He was public- spirited and liberal, and his daughter was said to owe much to the encouragement of both her parents. Her mother, Anna Rebecca Spooner (1822‚Äì1891), was the daughter of Colonel Alden Spooner of Brooklyn, New York. Alden Spooner's ancestors were also editors and publishers. Mrs. Huling's family was also literary minded. Among them were \\"Fanny Fern\\" (Sara Willis), Nathaniel Parker Willis, and the brothers Prime (Samuel I. Prime, Edward Dorr Griffin Prime and William Cowper Prime) who were her cousins. Her mother was directly descended from John Alden and Priscilla Alden (ascending line: Alden Spooner, Judah Paddock Spooner, Rebecca Paddock, Alice Alden, David Alden, John Alden), made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Huling was graduated from the village high school. Music, languages and the periodicals of the day were studied after that date. Career Caroline Augusta Huling chose journalism as her profession. Under the tutelage of her father she began active work when but twelve years old, starting with society reporting in the ballrooms of Saratoga Springs. Later on, sermons and conventions were entrusted to her. For several years Huling followed the usual routine of most young women, entering society and taking an active interest in temperance and church work. In 1874 she became a Good Templar, holding her membership continuously until the end of the century. She was prominent in the work and held several offices in the lodges. When the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was organized, she was one of the first to don the white ribbon, the symbol of appartenance to the union. She was one of the first executive board members of the Humane society and secretary of the local Woman Suffrage Society. Much inspiration to greater efforts in the latter line was derived from frequent visits to Boston, where she mingled with those of similar tastes and studied the methods which they favored. Huling was especially trained as a teacher and expected to follow that profession, but the ill health of both her parents prevented, and, becoming tired of what seemed an idle life, she begged to enter business, and was duly installed associate editor of the Saratoga Sentinel with her father, and became his right hand in all business matters, having special superintendence of his book-bindery. She was also correspondent of many city papers. President Grover Cleveland, then Governor of New York and with whom her family had political connections, made her a notary public, the first woman in New York to be appointed a notary public. Huling was for two years secretary of the Cook County Equal Suffrage Association, for two years superintendent of press work of the State society, and for one year county organizer. In 1884 she went to Chicago to attend the national suffrage convention and decided to move permanently and try to self-support herself as journalist and devoting most of her time to the cause of woman's enfranchisement. There she became an associate editor of a trade journal, having responded to a want ad as \\"C. A. Huling\\", to avoid being identified as a woman. In 1885 Huling was a founding member of the Illinois Woman's Press Association (IWPA), and for several years she was one of its executive board. In 1890 she represented the association in the National Newspaper Association, and was unanimously elected assistant recording secretary of that body, the first woman elected to office. Huling took great interest in the formation of the Illinois Woman's Alliance, in October 1888, and was elected president, serving two-years without opposition, and declining election the third year in order to devote herself to a working-woman's club, of which she was also president. From October 1887 to November 1888, Huling edited and published an eight-page semi-monthly periodical called Justitia, a Court for the Unrepresented, in which she had a small pecuniary interest. It was the organ of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association, and devoted to the advancement of women, social purity and other reforms. Owing to differences of opinion regarding its editorial policy, Justitia was discontinued at the close of its first volume. Huling was well and favorably known as a speaker, possessing a clear, distinct voice and an unconventional manner. In 1884 she made several addresses for the Prohibition party and exerted her personal influence in the lodge-room and elsewhere for that party. She was known as a superior parliamentarian. When very young, she became a member of the Episcopal Church. For many years she was very devoted to that form of faith, but at the end of the 19th century she adopted the liberal tendencies of her father and became broadly undenominational, though still retaining a respect for the church in which she was reared and a nominal membership therein. Much of Huling's work with the pen was in the line of unsigned editorial and special articles. She had a taste for fiction and more purely literary work, and aspired to achieve success in that line, publishing a number of short stories. She especially delighted in news-editorial work, and was peculiarly fitted for it. In March 1888 Huling went to a conference in Washington, D.C., put on by the International Council of Women. There she served as a link connecting the Chicago and international women's movements. In the fall of 1891 Huling aided in the organization of the Woman's Baking Company, and became its secretary. The philanthropic features of the plan appealed to her sympathies, and she relinquished her professional work in a great measure to aid her sisters, the company aiming to provide a good investment for small savings and an avenue of employment for many women. Huling published The Bookseller and edited numerous newsletters, among them Social Progress, The Stylus, and The Sentinel. She additionally authored two novels, The Courage of Her Convictions (1896) and Letters of a Business Woman to Her Niece. In The Courage of Her Convictions the heroine, wanting a child but disillusioned by men, seeks artificial insemination as a compromise. In the end she decides that a child needs two parents after all, and marries her doctor, the father of the baby. In 1912 Huling founded the Midwest chapter of Alden Kindred of America. Reading Room of the Chicago Woman's Club Huling was also an active member of many other societies. She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Hugenot Society of Pennsylvania, the Institute of American Genealogy, the Woman's City Club of Chicago, and the Society of Midland Authors. Personal life Both Huling's parents died in 1890. All of their nine living children were more or less connected with newspaper work, and were authors. All were married excepting Huling. They were: Maria Smith Huling (1843‚Äì1918, married George Oberne (1843‚Äì1911)), Alden Spooner Huling (born 1845, married Ida M. Ferris (born ca. 1851)), Mary Jermaine Huling (born 1847, married (1) Eugene Dibble Ainsworth (born ca. 1843) and (2) A. LeRoy Freeman (born ca. 1843), Nancy L'Amoreux Huling (born 1850), John Beekman Huling (1852‚Äì1917, married Mary Eliza Eberwine (1859‚Äì1951)), Henry Pierson Huling (born 1853, married Ellen Newell (born ca. 1854)), Katherine Barclay Huling (born 1858), Edmund James Huling (born 1860), Margaret Olivia Huling (1863‚Äì1874). She died on March 10, 1941, and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, Downers Grove, Illinois.

They were officially established as the main ultras group for Shk√´ndija in 1992. History The supporters of KF Shk√´ndija are called the Ballist√´t, named after the World War II Balli Komb√´tar. When the club was formed in 1979, use of nationalism was strictly prohibited by the Yugoslavian government. The supporting firm of Shk√´ndija called themselves BAL, using the first three letters of Balli Komb√´tar. When Shk√´ndija was reinstated into the Macedonian Football League, the supporting firm was re- established as the Ballist√´t in 1992. When kick-off commences, The Ballist√´t always sing the national anthem of Albania. In Tetovo, the group has been responsible for the desecration of the monument to the fallen partisans in the national-liberation struggle. They graffiti \\"Ballistet Shk√´ndija\\" and \\"1992 Ultras\\". This occurred ten days after the Macedonian independence day. 2010s The Ballist√´t are one of the most notorious football supporter groups in Macedonia.Filip Zdraveski Their antics are occasionally reported on the news. On 18 October 2010, Shk√´ndija played against FK Napredok away in Kicevo. The Ballist removed the Macedonian flag from the mast and put an Albanian flag in its place. As the police tried to put the Macedonian flag up again, the Ballist tore out their seats and threw them at the police. Fans of opposing clubs barely go to Ecolog Arena as the \\"Ballistet\\" are one of the largest firms in Macedonia. This was noted when FK Rabotniƒçki played Shk√´ndija in 2008. Rabotnicki had the lead over Shk√´ndija in Tetovo with the score 0:1. A loss would have meant relegation into the second division. At half time, Rabotnicki's players and coaches were attacked when they were leaving the pitch. Rabotnicki supporters and police could not stop the large presence of Shk√´ndija supporters, resulting in the match to be abandoned and Shk√´ndija being relegated to the second league. On 3 August 2010, during a heated match with city rivals Teteks, the majority of the supporters of Teteks, the Vojvodi, abandoned their team in the 78th minute and left the stadium to avoid clashing with the Shk√´ndija supporters after the game. Those that remained for the whole game had to remain in the stadium as the Ballist√´t were outside the stadium waiting for them. A heavy police presence escorted the Teteks supporters out of the stadium. On 11 September 2011, the Shkendija supporters attacked fans and players of FK Ohrid at half time. This resulted in Shkendija supporters being suspended for two home matches. After Partizan Belgrade defeated Shk√´ndija in Skopje for the qualifying rounds of the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Champions League, Partizan coach Aleksandar Stanojevic stated that Shk√´ndija out played Partizan in the first half due to the great atmosphere of the Shk√´ndija supporters intimidating the Partizan players. In the match, the Albanian flag covered the entire west end of the stadium, along with banners such as \\"Ballistet\\", \\"1st state Albania, 2nd state Kosova, 3rd state coming soon\\" and \\"24 March 1999\\". The Ballistet chanted notable remarks such as, \\"Ubi ubi srbina\\" (Kill the Serbs) , Adem Jashari, U√áK, Republic of Kosovo and singing Albanian nationalist songs. On 10 March 2012, two Shk√´ndija supporters were arrested after a policeman was stabbed while apparently protecting two men from a mob attack. The cause of this was retaliation for the killing of two ethnic Albanians by an off-duty police officer in the town of Gostivar. After the arrests, hardcore Shkendija fans, the Ballist√´t, threatened to cause trouble in a match against league leaders Vardar Skopje originally scheduled for Wednesday, which had been suspended and played on another date with no fans being allowed to attend. In May 2012, a delegation of the Ballist√´t ultras travelled to neighbouring Kosovo to pay their respects at a shrine to Adem Jashari, one of the founders of the Kosovo Liberation Army. On 4 May 2012, the Ballist√´t joined counter-protests in ethnic Albanian neighbourhoods for the inter-ethnic violence. On 23 May 2013, the Macedonian Cup final was abandoned late on Wednesday between Shk√´ndija and Teteks. The match was abandoned after 20 minutes for fear that the chants might ignite violence. The Shk√´ndija supporters booed the Macedonian national anthem, threw flares at the police and security as well as chanting \\"Ballisti Zakon\\", \\"U√áK\\" and other nationalistic rhetoric. Also and Macedonian fans of Teteks did the same against Albanians. The match between Teteks and Shk√´ndija was rescheduled for Sunday and the Macedonian Football Federation said it would be played in an empty stadium to avoid provocation. After Shk√´ndija's 5‚Äì0 victory over Teteks, Shk√´lzen Meta, the leading captain of the Ballist√´t, handed over the reins to the young Isak Luma. On 19 October 2014, during the rivalry match against FK Vardar, The Ballist√´t held a large banner stating \\"They are cancer of Europe ‚Äì UEFA do you need more?!\\" accompanied with a montage of pictures showing Serb hooligans involved in the Serbia vs England U-21 match, Italy vs Serbia match and the Serbia vs Albania match. The Ballist√´t are part of the TKZ ultras group that supports Albania in international football. In the next home game against FK Metalurg, the Ballist√´t, dissatisfied with the UEFA ruling of the cancelled Serbia vs Albania match, held banners stating \\"Dear Platinovic, They beat our players and won 3:0! We kill them in the return match and we get EURO 16 final spot??\\" along with chants against UEFA and Michel Platini. On 7 April 2015, Shk√´ndija were fined by the FFM and supporters banned due to politically motivated banners and chants, as well as the assault on FK Tetek's manager Gorazd Mihajlov. A banner with a picture of Milenko Nedelkovski and an Orangutan were held up with a caption stating, \\"is there a difference?\\". The Ballist√´t have sent a letter to the FFM stating that the banner was in retaliation for Nedelkovski's offensive remarks about Albanians. Milenko Nedelkovski runs a talk show on Macedonia state television and is a fervent supporter of VMRO-DPMNE. On the morning of the 21 February 2016, two buses of Buducnost Podgorica supporters, Varvari Podgorica, travelled to Skopje to attend a match. On the road to Skopje, Shkendija supporters, Ballist√´t, came across the supporters while heading towards the match between Shkendija and Turnovo on the bridge. The slavic medias claim that Ballist√´t initiated the clash between the 2 groups, but in reality it was the Buducnost supporters attacking one bus of the Shk√´ndijas supporters convoy(around 10 buses in total). The other buses were a little left behind, when they arrived the clash had already started. When the Ballist√´t almost outnumbered the montenegrins and after the montenegrins getting beaten up, they started boarding their buses. The built adrenaline and the need of a hospital made the montenegrin drivers rage and speed up on the mountainy roads, nearly running over the opposite fans. After the clash Shk√´ndija's convoy continued the road without any consequences. Shk√´ndija won the match that day, with Marjan Radeski's only 2 goals of the match. Notable fans Shk√´ndija's main supporters are Albanians from Tetovo, greater Albania regions and Albanian diaspora. Some notable fans include politicians Shpend Ahmeti and Albin Kurti, actors Xhevdet Jashari and Blerim Destani, singers Shkumbin Ismaili and Arif Ziberi of Elita 5 and athletes, Blerim Dzemaili and Admir Mehmedi.

The film stars Nani, Anupama Parameswaran, Rukshar Dhillon in lead roles. Nani played a dual role for the third time after Janda Pai Kapiraju & Gentleman. Part of the film was shot in Prague, Czech Republic. The film opened worldwide on 12 April 2018 to mixed reviews, with praise for Nani's acting but criticism of the screenplay, lag in second half, its farfetchedness and its formulaic story.  Plot  Krishna & Arjun Jayaprakash (both played by Nani) are lookalikes hailing from Akkurthi village in Chittoor and the other from Prague in the Czech Republic, respectively. While the former is a happy-go-lucky individual, the latter is a rockstar and a flirt. Krishna falls in love with the village president's (Nagineedu) granddaughter Riya (Rukshar Dhillon), a doctor. Arjun loves a traditional Indian girl Subbalakshmi (Anupama Parameswaran), a wildlife photographer. In the village, Riya's grandfather comes to know about her relationship with Krishna and sends her to Hyderabad, and Krishna follows her. Meanwhile, Subbalakshmi starts to hate Arjun because of his flirting nature. In a certain incident, her professional camera is damaged by Arjun's manager Brahmaji (Brahmaji), which contains a rare photograph. Arjun realizes he really loves her and goes to her aunt's (Devadarshini) house to convince her, but she thinks it is one of his tricks to make her fall in love with him. Subbalakshmi leaves Prague and returns to India, and Arjun follows her. In Hyderabad, Riya and Subbalakshmi are kidnapped by a trafficking gang who plan on sending them to Dubai. Upon reaching Hyderabad, Krishna and Arjun realize that neither of the girls has reached home and begin searching for them. How Krishna and Arjun try to track down the traffickers to rescue the girls forms the climax of the story.  Cast  * Nani as Krishna & Arjun Jayaprakash (Dual role) * Anupama Parameswaran as Subbalakshmi * Rukshar Dhillon as Riya * Brahmaji as Brahmaji, Arjun's manager * Devadarshini as Dhinchak Roja, Subbalakshmi's aunt * Nagineedu as Riya's grandfather * Ravi Awana as Bhai * Prabhas Sreenu as Shankar * Hari Teja as Shankar's wife * Vidyullekha Raman as Call Center Girl * Pooja Ramachandran as Nikki * Alapati Lakshmi as Krishna's mother * Kalpalatha as Riya's mother * Chatrapathi Sekhar as Bhai's henchmen * Mirchi Hemanth as TV Journalist * Neelya Bhavani as Doctor * Ruhika Dass as Jessy * Sudhakar * Rajeshwari Pamidighantam * Mashesh Vitta  Soundtrack  The duo Hiphop Tamizha composed the music for the film. This is their second Telugu film after Dhruva. 'Turn This Party Up' is a peppy rock number. 'Dhaari Choodu' is a folk song which has typical Chittoor dialect. 'I Wanna Fly' is a soothing melody which has two versions composed parallelly. 'Ela Ela' is a heartbreak montage love song. 'Urime Manase' is yet another breakup number. 'Thaaney Vachhindhanaa' is a slow and pleasant melody.  Release  = Marketing = Dil Raju acquired distribution rights for the film in the Telugu states. In its pre-release business, the film earned Rs 35 crore from its global theatrical rights, Rs 7 crore from its satellite rights sold Star Maa, Rs 4.50 crore from its Hindi dubbing rights and Rs 50 lakh from its music and other rights. Shine Screens distributed the film locally. Magnus Media acquired overseas theatrical rights for Rs 3.50 crore and arranged 600 shows in the US, on its release day.  Reception  = Critical response = The film received mixed negative reviews from critics. Neeshita Nyayapati, from Times of India rated the film 2.5/5 and wrote 'Walking away from the film, the only memories that one takes back happy is the vision of Nani dancing to ‚ÄòDhaari Choodu‚Äô with childish abandon, the humorous scenes that elevate the first half and the fact that his friend spells Riya's name as Royya. For a film that touches the subject of human trafficking, it sure bombs at making a point.' Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from The Hindu, while praising the acting performance of Nani as Krishna and the picturization of Dhaari Choodu song, also wrote, 'on the whole, Krishnarjuna Yuddham doesn‚Äôt get its rhythm right. There was a time, not long ago, when Nani's name was associated with films that stood out from the clutter. This one had the potential to be a fusion of global and local music, the way Arjun wanted it to be, but ends up a mess'. Hemanth Kumar from Firstpost rated the film 2/5 and wrote, 'there's a notion that the film has all the necessary elements - vastly different characters, a conflict, an issue it tries to address - to make for an engaging drama, but on the other side, there's the image of me sitting in the cinema hall not knowing what to make of the film because it struggles to find its rhythm and doesn‚Äôt build the drama efficiently' = Box office = The film collected $162K from its US premiers. On opening day, the film collected Rs 4.58 crores in the Telugu states. This is the fourth biggest opening for Nani, falling behind ‚ÄòMCA‚Äô, ‚ÄòNinnu Kori‚Äô and ‚ÄòEega‚Äô. MCA had reportedly raked in Rs 7.57 Cr on its opening day, ‚ÄòNinnu Kori‚Äô Rs 4.72 Cr and ‚ÄòEega‚Äô Rs 4.61 Cr. The film was made on a budget of 30 crores and only recovered 14.50 crores. It could not even recover 50% at the box office, labeling it as Nani's first disaster since 2014.

History The former H√¥tel de Valentinois, as painted in the 1770s by Alexis-Nicolas P√©rignon bordering present-day Rue Raynouard. In January 1837, the Brothers of the Christian Schools opened a boarding school for boys at 165Rue du Faubourg Saint-Martin, which they transferred on 8 April 1839 to Passy (at the time a commune on the outskirts of Paris), in specially-built facilities and ones of the allotted H√¥tel de Valentinois which they had possibly preserved.Annuaire, p. 91; Doniol, p. 42. In the following decades, the Brothers rebuilt some of the school's facilities and expanded other ones, as the number of boarders kept growing, despite a decrease during the French Revolution of 1848.Annuaire, p. 92. The school buildings bordered eventually, if not from the day of its opening in Passy, all of the segment of present-day Rue Raynouard running from the corner of present-day Rue Singer to that of Rue des Vignes. On 18 March 1864, the school (having over 700 pupils then) was visited by Minister of Education Victor Duruy, who complimented the Brothers \\"in the most flattering terms upon the appearance and tendency of the pensionnat\\".Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education. Another ministerial visit took place on 12 May of the same year, > caused by the resistance to the projet de loi for special instruction which > was manifested in the parliamentary commission which had been appointed to > examine the subject. To overcome this opposition M. Duruy invited the > members of the commission to accompany him to Passy, in order to demonstrate > to them, as he expressed it, the successful realization of his project by > the Christian Brothers. As a law of 7 July 1904 prevented religious congregations from teaching any longer, the Brothers moved their boarding school's residence to Froyennes, Belgium in 1905.Journal officiel; Houssain, p. 163. They would be selling off approximately three quarters of the boarding school's buildings in Passy.Houssain, p. 164.

Life Davidson was born in Cohoes in New York in 1900, the son of a travelling salesman, Matthew H. Davidson and his wife Laura (Sutherland). He studied at the University of Pennsylvania graduating in 1923, and taking successively a Master's (1924) and Doctoral degree in anthropology (1928). He was appointed instructor at his alma mater, remaining there, apart from a brief stint at the University of Buffalo for the academic year 1932-1932, until 1946. He spent a year at the University of Oregon before accepting a professorship at the University of Washington where he taught until his untimely death three years later. Davidson's initial research focused, under the direction of his mentor Frank Speck, on the eastern Algonquian, where he developed an archaeological approach. Already with his doctoral dissertation however his deep interest in the indigenous population of Australia emerged as he applied the diffusionist model of the age and area theory to antipodean ethnographical materials. His doctoral thesis The Chronological Aspects of Certain Australian Social Institutions as inferred from Geographical Distribution was subject to a scathing critique at the time by one of the major authorities on Australian ethnography, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown. A grant from the American Philosophical Society enabled him to do fieldwork over nearly two years in northern Australia (1930-1931), followed up by a further stay in 1938-1939. Over this time, Davidson managed to gather a list of native vocabularies amounting to some 4200 words, collected from informants speaking 19 different languages of Western Australia. Much of this material has yet to receive close attention from researchers. In 1938 he published A Preliminary Register of Australian Tribes and Hordes together with an An Ethnic Map of Australia, a magisterial synthesis of his close sieving of the available ethnographic materials regarding Aboriginal groups. He followed this up with a monograph in 1941 on Australian tribal string figures, exhibiting a prestidigitator's mastery for replicating such designs which he had already demonstrated in a paper he had published in a 1927 paper on string figures among the Virginian Indians. Davidson also retrieved unpublished manuscript material written by Edith Hassell on the myths of the Koreng tribe of Western Australia, and edited it for publication over 1934 and 1935.

Career Shamir began working as an Insurance Agent at Mivtach, a subsidiary of the Sahar Insurance Group. In 1981, at the age of 30, Shamir purchased 50% of the company's shares and changed its name to Mivtach Shamir Holdings Ltd. In 1992 Shamir went on to purchase the remaining shares of the company, thus becoming its sole owner and director. In the following years, Shamir sold the company's insurance business, turning it into an internationally active Israel-based investment company that invests mainly in technology and communications, real estate and industrial companies. Under Shamir's leadership the company's market value in the stock exchange grew from 20 million NIS (approx. $5.6 million) in 1992 to 830 million NIS (approx. $230 million) by Jun/2017.

A full-brother to Sadler's Wells he won two of his five races in a track career which lasted from August 1985 until May 1986. As a two-year-old he finished unplaced in the Phoenix Stakes on his debut before winning a maiden race and then recorded his biggest victory in the National Stakes. In the following spring he ran third in the Gladness Stakes and then finished last in the 2000 Guineas before being retired from racing. In a brief stud career he sired several good winners, most notably Lyric Fantasy. Background Tate Gallery was a bay horse with a broad white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred in Kentucky by Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. During his racing career he carried the colours of the Greek shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos and was trained at Ballydoyle by Vincent O'Brien. Both Sangster and Niarchos were partner in John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. Tate Gallery was sired by the Canadian stallion Northern Dancer who won the Kentucky Derby in 1964 and went on to become one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. His dam Fairy Bridge was bought for $40,000 by Sangster in 1976 and was undefeated in a brief racing career consisting of two races as a juvenile in 1977. In the Irish Free Handicap for that year she was rated the joint-best two-year-old filly alongside Sookera. As a broodmare she was an outstanding success, with her other foals including Tate Gallery's full-brothers Sadler's Wells and Fairy King. She came from an exceptional family, being a half-sister to Nureyev and a close relative of Thatch Racing career =1985: two-year-old season= Tate Gallery had a challenging introduction to the track when he was ridden by Pat Eddery in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 10 August. O'Brien had not intended to run the colt in the race but changed his plans when Tate Gallery's better-fancied stablemate Woodman fell sick. Despite his lack of experience he was made the 5/4 favourite but finished unplaced behind Roaring Riva, with Eddery easing him down when it became apparent that he had no chance of winning. Later that month he recorded his first success in a maiden race over even furlongs at the Curragh, winning \\"smoothly\\" from nineteen opponents. In the National Stakes (run as a Group 1 race for the first time) over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 14 September Tate Gallery was ridden by Cash Asmussen and started the 4/6 favourite. The best of his eight opponents appeared to be the British filly Sweet Adelaide and the Jim Bolger-trained colt Nashamaa both of whom came ito the race unbeaten. After tracking the leaders Tate Gallery went to the front two furlongs out and stayed on well under pressure to win by one and a half lengths from Nashamaa with Sweet Adelaide a further one and a half length back in third. In the official International Classification for 1985, Tate Gallery was given a rating of 77, six pounds behind the top-rated Bakharoff. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 117p (with the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make more than usual improvement) making him fourteen pounds inferior to their best two-year-old Huntingdale. =1986: three-year- old season= Tate Gallery began his second season in the Gladness Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in which he was matched against older horses. He finished third behind the four-year-old Lidhame with Timeform reporting that he \\"hung left and lacked enthusiasm\\". Despite his poor effort at the Curragh he was sent to England for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 May. He was ridden by Tony Ives after O'Brien had first offered the ride to the recently retired Lester Piggott. He made no impact, coming home last of the fourteen finishers behind Dancing Brave and never raced again. Stud career Tate Gallery was retired to stud and became a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary at an initial fee of 15,000 guineas. He died in an accident in 1990 at the age of seven. By far the best of his offspring was the exceptionally fast and precocious filly Lyric Fantasy, but he sired a few other good winners including Surrealist (Godolphin Stakes), Title Roll (King George Stakes) and Lee Artiste (Sandy Lane Stakes) He was also the damsire of the Prix de l'Abbaye winner Namid.

The British divisions were still organising their defences on the ridge, having recently relieved the French when the German attack began. The attack was a success and raised concerns that it was a prelude to a more ambitious attempt to capture Arras. Plans were made for a British counter-attack but it was cancelled, to avoid a diversion of effort from the forthcoming offensive on the Somme, in favour of the Attack on the Gommecourt Salient; plans laid in the meantime formed the basis for the attack of the Canadian Corps in April 1917.

Eighty artillery batteries, including the artillery of the IX Reserve Corps, IV Corps and the Guard Reserve Corps, plus six batteries of heavy howitzers and nine mortar batteries, along with six heavy, nine medium and eight light Minenwerfer were to participate.

It was officially launched on 23 April 2017 with the sole purpose of returning the power of government to the hands of the citizenry. It is a broad based party that practices inclusive politics and champions democracy and citizen's rights, and the nation's inherent national values. Its ideology is defined by its leaders as one based on their definition of Bangladeshi Nationalism. It identifies as centrist. The party has got registration from the Election Commission of Bangladesh. The symbol of the party is Lion. History Nationalist Democratic Movement ‚Äì NDM has its origins in the ShopnerDesh movement started by party founder and Chairman, Bobby Hajjaj. The erosion of political values, centralization of party power, and the abeyance of democratic norms, were reasons stated by party leaders for their formation of the party. Party Chairman along with other current members of the NDM's National Executive Committee started work on launching the party at a national scale in midyear 2016 and on 23 April 2017 they officially launched the party. According to party leadership NDM had the biggest launch of any political party in Bangladesh with representatives from over thirty districts convening for the official launch in Dhaka. Ideology In its official Declaration NDM lists (i) Bangladeshi Nationalism, (ii) Religious Values, (iii) Spirit of Independence, and (iv) Accountable Democracy, as their core values. The first, Bangladeshi Nationalism, is made declared as most significant and they argue that their definition differs from the current understanding of the term in Bangladesh politics. =Bangladeshi Nationalism= The party's Declaration denounces the use of the term by other political parties, especially the BNP, and adds that theirs is a definition of complete national inclusion. They also aver that the Awami League's ideology of Bengali Nationalism is outdated, stating that the citizenry is now unified under their identity as Bangladeshi and not through language, religion, or any other cultural artifact. Their declaration document states Bangladeshi Nationalism cannot and must not ever be confused with jingoism or a philosophy of exclusion. It is an overarching philosophy of belonging, an establishment of faith in the bonds of citizenship, in the fraternity and love of each other and of nation that transcends all other constructs. Bangladeshi Nationalism is the inherent faith we have in our identity and is the bedrock of NDM. Elections The party was seeking registration from the Election Commission of Bangladesh to participate in the next General Election, likely to be held in late 2018 or early 2019.

It is located on the Eskenazi Health campus, near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and is part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.  Description  Calm Waters is a 2013 mixed-media installation by artist Kathy Bradford, which consists of seven panels of ‚Öú-inch thick glass that sit several inches in front of a painted abstract pattern resembling waves in blue, gray, and teal. The glass panels consist of sand-carved clear laminated glass and clear, white, and gray etched glass. A technique known as glue- chipping, which creates a sparkle effect, is also used on the panels. The layered arrangement of glass and paint, which measures 77\\" x 238\\" overall, creates the illusion of both notable depth and change or movement as pedestrians walk past. Of the work's subject and purpose, the artist says: ‚ÄúThis imagery is of a large body of calm water with cloud reflections throughout the composition. This imagery is intended to transport the thoughts of the viewer, creating relaxation and calmness. Combining the art glass with the painted wall behind the glass surface creates multiple colors shifting throughout the composition. It is intended to intrigue the viewer and encourage further investigation.‚Äù -Kathy Bradford  Historical information  = Acquisition = Calm Waters was commissioned by Eskenazi Health as part of a re-imagining of the organization's historical art collection and to support \\"the sense of optimism, vitality and energy\\" of its new campus in 2013.

Narrative consumption was a large influence on Hiroki Azuma's theory of otaku and database consumption. Overview Narrative consumption involves the relationship between \\"grand narratives\\" or \\"worldviews\\" and \\"small narratives\\" or \\"variations\\". The concept of worldview or world (sekai), which comes from anime production and kabuki tradition, refers to the entire world or setting of a work of fiction. Each individual story told within that universe (such as an episode or even season of television) is a small narrative, or a variation of the worldview. In his book, ≈åtsuka examines the way children consumed Bikkuriman Chocolates, which came with stickers featuring a character. The stickers were the primary commodity: children would throw the chocolate out and keep the sticker. ≈åtsuka argues that each sticker, with its character, contained a fragment of a larger narrative. Children collected these stickers (small narratives) in order to consume more of the grand narrative. ≈åtsuka also writes about otaku subculture and how the creation of d≈çjinshi fits into this paradigm. According to ≈åtsuka, multiple small narratives can exist within the grand narrative. In kabuki theatre, multiple variations of the same narrative setting are common. He finds a similar pattern in Japanese fan subcultures, where fans create d≈çjinshi containing unofficial stories set within the world of an established media work. ≈åtsuka argues that once the fans consumed the official narrative, they were able to make their own variations from the worldview referenced by the original work. However, because both the original story and the fan-created stories are small narratives set within the grand narrative, they are equally valid.  Impact  The philosopher Hiroki Azuma was heavily influenced by narrative consumption when writing Otaku: Japan's Database Animals. Azuma argues that narrative consumption has been replaced by the database, a new paradigm of media consumption. Azuma's use of narrative consumption in his work sparked a renewed interest in the theory, which led to a second edition of ≈åtsuka's book in 2001. Marc Steinberg writes that Azuma helped narrative consumption gain \\"canonical status within manga and anime criticism\\".

The resolution tightened economic sanctions for the 6th time, since they were first imposed in 2006, when North Korea had its first nuclear test. The new restrictions ban purchases of North Korean coal, iron, lead and seafood (the country‚Äôs main exports). According to some estimates, this will deprive the regime of $1 billion a year‚Äîa third of its foreign earnings. The sanctions also prohibit governments around the world from admitting any more North Korean workers, as the regime pockets most of their wages.  Background  Before adopting this resolution, North Korea had conducted 14 missile tests in 2017, advancing its capabilities to eventually deliver a nuclear warhead. The tests in July 2017 were of intercontinental ballistic missiles. For the first time they demonstrated the capability by the DPR Korea to deliver warheads to even as far as part of the continental U.S. Continued efforts by North Korea in advancing the host of technologies to allow them to launch a nuclear strike, led the UN to for the 6th time impose tightening economic sanctions against the country since they were first imposed in 2006. Sanctions The resolution imposes several full sectoral bans on exports North Korea uses to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, namely: *A ban on its largest export, coal, representing a loss to North Korea of over $401 million in revenues per year; *A ban on iron and iron ore exports, worth roughly $250 million per year; *A ban on seafood exports, worth roughly $300 million in revenue each year; and *A ban on lead and lead ore exports, worth roughly $110 million per year; Sanctions also tighten North Korea's access to the international financial system, by expanding prior financial sanctions to include a foreign asset freeze of North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank. It also bans countries from accepting new North Korean laborers. Analysis According to some estimates, the new tightening of sanctions will deprive the regime of $1 billion a year, a third of its foreign earnings. According to sources interviewed by The Economist, the regime has grown adept at dodging the restrictions, using illicit slush funds in China to finance business partnerships. The higher commissions on offer for such risky transactions simply attract more capable middlemen. Enforcement has been patchy: of the UN‚Äôs 193 members, only 77 have reported on their implementation of the previous round of sanctions, adopted in November 2016. Further, China, which accounts for more than 90% of North Korea‚Äôs trade, has promised to apply the new restrictions ‚Äúfully and strictly‚Äù. However, they do not include the one measure thought likely to cause the regime real difficulty: a curb on the North‚Äôs imports of oil.

B. Cowell, Asian Educational Services, 2000 p.37 Story The story runs that the Bodhisattva was born as a monkey, ruler over 80,000 monkeys. They lived at a spot near the Ganges and ate of the fruit of a great mango tree. King Brahmadatta of Benares, desiring to possess the mangoes, surrounded the tree with his soldiers, in order to kill the animals, but the Bodhisattva formed a bridge over the stream with his own body and by this means enabled the whole tribe to escape into safety. Devadatta, the jealous and wicked cousin of the Buddha, was in that life one of the monkeys and, thinking it a good chance to destroy his enemy, jumped on the Bodhisattva‚Äôs back and broke his heart. The king, seeing the good deed of the Bodhisattva and repenting of his own attempt to kill him, tended him with great care when he was dying and afterwards gave him royal obsequies. Depiction in Bharhut In this jataka tale the Buddha, in a previous incarnation as a monkey king, self-sacrificingly offers his own body as a bridge by which his fellow monkeys can escape from a human king who is attacking them. A short section of the river, across which the monkeys are escaping, is indicated by fish designs. Directly below that, the impressed humans are holding out a blanket to catch him when he falls.

To the left, at the top, is the great mango tree to which two monkeys are clinging, while the king of the monkeys is stretched across the river from the mango tree to the opposite bank, and over his body some monkeys have already escaped to the rocks and jungles beyond. In the lower part of the panel, to the left, is king Brahmadatta on horseback with his soldiers, one of whom with bow and arrow is aiming upwards at the Bodhisattva.

He was the son of Fran√ßois- Paul de Solages, Marquis de Carmaux in Albigeois, and his second wife Isabeau Catherine de Galatrave. His elder brothers were Antoine-Paulin de Solages (1706‚Äì78), Marquis de Carmaux and Fran√ßois-Paul (1707‚Äì73), Comte de Solages. Gabriel de Solages was intelligent and energetic. He was received as a page of the king on 15 September 1729. He campaigned in Italy with his brothers as a lieutenant in the Royal-Carabineers regiment, and later fought in Germany and Bohemia. He rose through the ranks, becoming mestre-de-camp for a brigade of carabineers. On 13 October 1749 he married Marie de Juillot de Longchamps, daughter of Jean-Fran√ßois de Juillot de Longchamps, equerry, and of Fran√ßoise de Guyot. Coal mines A royal decree of 14 January 1744 let the government grant concessions to private individuals to exploit the subsoil. At this time industry was developing in France and coal was an attractive alternative to increasingly scarce wood. Gabriel's brother, the marquis Antoine Paulin, received a concession in 1747, and again in 1748. Gabriel recalled that \\"since the disarray of my brother's affairs made it impossible for him to make better use of this new authorization than he had made of the first, he engaged me to take it over\\". Gabriel agreed, with the consent of his mother, to become the head of the mining operation. Gabriel de Solages quickly suspended the work at the existing Mon-Talba mine because air did not reach the bottom of the galleries and started a new mine. The 1744 regulation stated that mine shafts could be no more than wide at their opening, which was inadequate. Gabriel asked for permission to make wider shafts with a rectangular cross-section with ladders attached to the walls for use by the miners and a separate chimney through which air could be blown into all the galleries. He braced the galleries with wood and cement structures to prevent collapses, and took precautions to prevent flooding. He encountered a layer of high quality coal in the new mine at a depth of . He suspended work and, with government permission, visited coal mines in the north to obtain further knowledge, and brought back a colony of experienced Flemish miners. On 19 December 1752 Louis XV of France granted Gabriel de Solages the concession of coal mines at Carmaux. This gave Gabriel de Solages the mining rights within a radius on one league around his Blaye ch√¢teau. By 1754 Solages was employing 12 Flemish miners and 20 local workers engaged in various operations, as well as a dozen horses. He had two working mines, each with a machine to hoist up the coal, was producing 100 barrels a day and had 6,000 barrels in store. Bordeaux at this time consumed 14,600 barrels a year, the diocese of Albi 3,000 and the region about 300. The enterprise was struggling due to the expenses from the glassworks, the high cost of transport of the coal, and competition from the English, who were dumping cheap coal on the market. In the years that followed he suffered from competition with nearby mines, but due to poor management several of these were abandoned, one was burned and others were flooded, leaving Solages the only mine operator. Portrait of Gabriel de Solages held by the Mus√©e du Verre In 1767 the king granted Solages a 50-year extension to his concession of 1752. The king also gave him the sole right for three years to search for coal within three leagues around the town of Albi, with the promise to grant a concession of one league around any mines that he exploited. In 1769 the mine beside the glassworks caught fire and had to be flooded by diverting a stream into it. The next year the king extended the license for exploration by another three years. Solages sunk two more pits, but the coal was inferior to the flooded mine. He extended a gallery towards the flooded mine in hope of locating the high-quality seam, but was forced to abandon this after three years due to flooding that his pump could not handle. In 1789 there were two working shafts at Carmaux, connected by subterranean galleries, and a third shaft that could be brought into operation within two weeks if needed. The mines employed 100 workers and 14 horses, and produced 16,000 barrels a year, each holding . Solages was not forced to close the coal mines in 1789 when the French Revolution began. At that time he was employing 100 workers. He was arrested in 1793 and his mines were placed under sequestration. A decree by the Committee of Public Safety of 24 Frimaire year III (13 December 1794) restored the lands and defined the limits of the concession. The mining rights would remain in the Solages family until the Compagnie mini√®re de Carmaux was nationalized in 1947. Glass works To make use of the coal Solages established a glass factory, and sent for glass workers from Bohemia and Saxony. The factory was licensed by a decree of 2 May 1751. It was opened in a ceremony on 20 April 1754 with the assistance of the cur√© of Carmaux, who lit the first fire, and two other priests. The glassworks were in a building beside the chateau with two furnaces, only one of which operated at any time. There were four store-rooms for the bottles, a room for the ashes, one for sand and one for earth. There were other shops for grinding stones, for blacksmiths and for carpenters. The workers were housed in a separate building. The constituents of the glass were placed in crucibles in openings in the furnace and melted by the coal fire. A team of four glassworkers stood at each opening making the bottles. At first there were five teams, including one to replace sick or absent workers. In 1758 the 20 workers made 200,000 bottles, which were sold in Montauban, Toulouse and Bourdeaux. He had planned to also make windows, but after three years he abandoned this attempt due to competition from factories in the Lyonnais. By 1789 the glassworks employed 62 workmen and produced 500,000 English-style brown bottles annually. Solages was paternalistic, giving pensions to retired glassworkers and often employing their widows in the glassworks or in his household. Other activities Solages had a brick factory built near the glassworks and started an iron smelting furnace, to be supplied by the mines at Alban. Solages also operated a factory for shipbuilding materials. Gabriel de Solages was made a brigadier of cavalry on 16 March 1767. He was appointed the king's commanding officer in Albigeois on 15 November 1770. He was promoted to mar√©chal de camp on 1 March 1780. Gabriel de Solages died on 28 July 1799 at the Ch√¢teau de La Verrerie, Carmaux, at the age of 87. His son Francois-Gabriel de Solages (1752‚Äì1834), took over the family business. His wife died in October 1827 at 103 years of age.

US 85 leaves I-25 at exit 128 and follows Santa Fe Avenue through Fountain before turning west briefly onto Lake Avenue, then turning north following Nevada Avenue through Colorado Springs before rejoining I-25 at exit 148. Approaching the south side of Denver, US 85 again leaves I-25 at exit 184. From there it heads west and north as a two-lane rural highway. It becomes an expressway near Chatfield Lake and the southern Denver suburbs of Littleton and Englewood, where it is commonly known as Santa Fe Drive. It continues north through Denver for a few miles before once again joining with I-25 at mile marker 207. There it runs concurrently with US 87 as well as I-25 and heads north through downtown Denver. At exit 214, US 85 turns east and runs concurrently with I-70 and US 6 for about a mile where it exits with US 6 and heads northeast through Commerce City.

History US 85 originally followed the route that I-25 would later take. In southern Colorado, US 85 originally was placed on city streets in Pueblo and Trinidad until 1938 where the route was ultimately paved from one state to another, taking place at the present I-25 corridor. =Realignment= Starting in 1942, a realignment project took place in northeastern Denver, involving the opening of Vasquez Blvd. Originally, US 85 ran along Brighton Blvd. from downtown going northeast and then was realigned along 46th Ave. to Vasquez Blvd. Five years later, in Pueblo, the route took the downtown streets before the Greenhorn/Crow bypass opened two years later. In 1950, the Palmer Lake/Larkspur bypass opened, moving US 85 along with US 87 along the expressway. The expressway opened north of Pueblo in 1951, which allowed both US 85 and US 87 to use the expressway coming out of downtown until 1954.

It was directed and written by Kip Oebanda. The concept for the film was created when Oebanda was watching a local horror film with a lawyer friend who described to him that law school is the \\"ultimate horror film\\". Oebanda presented the idea for the film at the 2014 Film Financing Forum. This led to Oebanda researching on law schools and its culture, law students and instructors and even the concept of friendship. He describes the film as a \\"love story\\" saying that friendship is a \\"form of love\\". He says that the characters in the film went through conflicts that made them make tough decisions and was asked to pick between friendship or personal success. The film was produced by Vanessa Ulgado. The film received support from the SM Foundation. Principal photography for Bar Boys was made in 2015 and additional shots were made the following year. Most of the school scenes, including the library and classrooms, were filmed in San Beda University, which was then a college, while scenes depicting the bar operations were actual footage shot during the 2015 bar examinations. Release The film distributed by Quantum Films made its theatrical debut on August 16, 2017 as one of the twelve official entries at the 2017 Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino. Reception The Cinema Evaluation Board gave Bar Boys an \\"A\\" rating.

the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus, near downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and is part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.  Description  May/September is a 2014 site-specific, permanent art installation created by artist Rob Ley located on the south exterior wall of the Parking Garage on the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus. The work, which measures 60' x 245' x 4', consists of approximately 6,500 anodized aluminum ‚Äúleaves‚Äù or panels of differing angles generally arranged vertically on the vast plane of the parking garage in order to create an ‚Äúinteractive, synthetic terrain.‚Äù Inspired by colors found in Hoosier artist T.C. Steele‚Äôs Four Seasons, works that are part of a larger mural project created for the hospital more than a century ago, and the changing of Indiana‚Äôs four recognizable seasons, the east sides of the installed aluminum panels feature a vibrant yellow color, while west-facing panel faces are dark indigo. This directional color program, in tandem with the differing angles and depths of protrusions, results in a dynamic fa√ßade that appears soft and undulating, ever-changing with the viewer‚Äôs position and speed. May/September was manufactured in collaboration with Indianapolis Fabrications, also known as iFab, an Indianapolis-based creative project fabrication company.  Historical information  = Acquisition = May/September was commissioned by Eskenazi Health as part of a re-imagining of the organization's historical art collection and to support \\"the sense of optimism, vitality and energy\\" of its new campus in 2013. In response to its nationwide request for proposals, Eskenazi Health received more than 500 submissions from 39 states, which were then narrowed to 54 finalists by an independent jury. Each of the 54 proposals was assigned an area of the new hospital by Eskenazi Health's art committee and publicly displayed in the existing Wishard Hospital and online for public comment; more than 3,000 public comments on the final proposals were collected and analyzed in the final selection. = Location = May/September is located on the south exterior wall of the Parking Garage located on the Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus in Indianapolis, Indiana. = Awards = May/September is a 2015 Public Art Network (PAN) Year in Review award recipient, the highest recognition for public art in the United States. Along with 30 other award recipients, May/September was chosen from more than 300 nationwide entries and was honored at the Americans for the Arts‚Äô 2015 Annual Convention in Chicago.  Artist  Rob Ley attended University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, where he received his B.Arch, and earned his M.Arch. from the University of California, Los Angeles.

The charity was located in Grozny, the Capital of Chechen Republic, and was dedicated to help children who had physical or mental trauma of war. Alik Djabrailov and Zarema Sadulayeva were kidnapped in the middle of the day in the charity office in the City of Grozny on August 10, 2009, then disappeared, then a day later found killed on the outskirts of the Grozny. The brutality of the killing of the couple of Zarema Sadulayeva (who was 33 year old) and Alik Djabrailov (also 33 year old), who married just two month before, caused international outcry among human rights, social institutions and media, was condemned by European Commission, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, German Federal Foreign Office; Bernard Kouchner of French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs said the human rights defenders killed systematically in Russia, and Russian government obliged to stop the crimes, punish culprits.  Save the Generation  Save the Generation charity was dedicated to help victims of war, including mine victims. Zarema Sadulayeva was leading the Grozny office of the charity. The Chechen charity, a nongovernmental organization, was founded in 2001 for psychological and physical rehabilitation to disabled children, orphans, and other victims of war. The group worked closely with UNICEF, for training about landmines, protection of the rights of the disabled.  Kidnapped and murdered  Alik Djabrailov and Zarema Sadulayeva were on August 10, 2009, together in the office of the Save the Generation, when at about 2 pm five unknown men came into and led out Alik Djabrailov together Zarema Sadulayeva. The charity was located in the centre of the City of the Grozny. One of the charity's employees was also in the office there and witnessed the abduction. Senior official at Russian human rights organization Memorial, Alexander Cherkasov, in interview for the Guardian said that two of the unknown were dressed up in black, while other three in camouflage. The unknown said they were from the security services and took Zarema Sadulayeva and Alik Djabrailov for questioning and left their telephone contact number. A little while later two of them returned in the charity office again and took Zarema Saduilayeva's mobile and Alik Djabrailov's car. When Zarema Sadulayeva and Alek Dzabrailov's colleagues called the contact number left by visitors, who were in reality kidnappers, then nobody answered them. On midnight of August 10‚Äì11, the dead bodies of Alik Djabrailov and Zarema Sadulayeva were found with gun wounds and traces of torture, in the boot of the Alik Djabrailov car. On August 11 Alik Djabrailov would have celebrated his 33rd birthday if he were alive. Zarema Sadulayeva was the same age of 33.  Investigation  Aug 11, 2009, Vladimir Markin, Russian Prosecutor General's Investigative Committee Spokesman, says about conducting investigation to determine all the circumstances of this incident as well as the perpetrators, and a group of experts from the Russian Prosecutor General's Investigative Committee has flown to the Grozny to help to solve the case. August 11, 2009, also Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, says the case is an inhuman crime and he'll take personal control of the investigation. 10 December 2009, Internet portal Caucasian Knot writes that when investigation started in the murder then colleagues of the killed human rights activists and friends criticized that because the investigation said Alik Djabrailov might be killed because he took part in recent Chechen warfare so maybe he was killed because of a feud after the warfare, but his wife killed just incidentally, but the friends and colleagues argued that if that be true why then Zarema Sadulayeva body had such severe traces of torture. 15 July 2012, portal Caucasian Knot publishes interview with Human Rights Watch/Russia senior official, Tatiana Lokshina, where she says: \\"...one witness who saw the kidnappers was questioned by investigation, a facial composite was composed. The witness knew also telephone number of the one of those visitors. Then the investigation took two years with such witness' testimony to identify kidnapper. But when the one was identified, it occurred that the identified was a police officer in the Kurchaloy Police Office who died during one of the police special operations. So there is no more investigation to be leading by now.\\" (This is a translation from Russian language; original quote see below in references.) January 22, 2015, investigative journalist Elena Milashina in the Novaya Gazeta writes that the murder is not yet investigated: \\"...in Chechnya unknown kidnapped and killed human rights defender Natalya Estemirova, also civil activists Alik Djabrailov and Zarema Sadulayeva, as well as during a special security operation led by Ramzan Kadyrov another activist, Zarema Gaysanova, disappeared.

He subsequently served in the RAF during the Second World War making models interpreting aerial photographs. This was when he met Sir James Mann, Master of the Armouries at the Tower of London. Robinson joined the staff of the Tower Armouries in 1946 as a Temporary Assistant, before rising to Assistant Keeper and finally, in 1970, Keeper of Armour. Robinson was a founder member and president of the Arms and Armour Society. In 1965 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1977, he was awarded an honorary MA by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.Robinson Obituary, The Times 18 January 1978 Between 1967 and 1969, Robinson (a practical armourer) worked with Charles Daniels to interpret and reconstruct the Roman armour nowadays known as 'lorica segmentata'. He produced a series of reconstructions of the two sub-types of armour from the Roman site at Corbridge and one from Newstead in time for them to be exhibited at the 1969 Congress of Roman Frontier Studies held in Cardiff.Daniels in Allason-Jones and Bishop 1988, 97‚Äì100 His work on the armour featured in one of his best-known books, The Armour of Imperial Rome. Published in 1975 by Lionel Leventhal at the Arms and Armour Press, it included line illustrations by his friend, Peter Connolly. Robinson's system of categorizing Roman helmets has been widely adopted in the UK and USA but never really found favour in Europe.Fischer 2014, 139‚Äì40. Robinson was not only known for Roman armour, since he worked on an exhibition of Japanese armour at the Tower Armouries and subsequently wrote two books on the subject.Robinson 1965; 1967.

These movements have historically been shaped in response to national and global reconfiguration of power, including colonialism, nationalism, dictatorship, democracy, and the War on Terror. The relationship between the women's movement and the Pakistani state has undergone significant shifts from mutual accommodation to confrontation and conflict.  Background  According to Zoya Rehman, the image of Pakistani womanhood has been a construction of the Pakistani state since its inception. Pakistani woman, she argues, are expected to guard their sexuality, are controlled, and can even be murdered in honour killings when they do not meet cultural expectations. According to Afiya S. Ziya, this cultural orthodoxy is produced and sponsored by state, the government, and its agency the ISPR as propaganda engineered to influence the public in its own pre-decided way, and censor what it considers to be unsuitable. The state, she argues, does not stop at controlling the national narrative but intrudes public and private life to decide what is legitimate and permissible as ‚ÄòPakistani culture‚Äô and, what is not. After independence, elite Muslim women in Pakistan continued to advocate for women's political empowerment through legal reforms. They mobilised support, leading to the passage of the Muslim Personal Law of Sharia in 1948, which recognised a woman's right to inherit all forms of property. There was an attempt to have the government include a Charter of Women's Rights in the 1956 constitution, but this was unsuccessful. The 1961 Muslim Family Laws Ordinance covering marriage and divorce, the most important sociolegal reform to have had Feminist drive in Pakistan, is still widely regarded as empowering to women. = First phase: 1947‚Äì1952 = Muslim women were some of the most badly affected victims of Partition; it is reported that 75,000 women were abducted and raped during this period. It was soon after this that Fatima Jinnah formed the Women's Relief Committee, which later evolved into the All Pakistan Women's Association. Jinnah later founded a secret radio station, and, in 1965, came out of her self-imposed political retirement to participate in the presidential election against military dictator Ayub Khan. Begum Ra'na Liaquat Ali Khan helped the refugees who fled India during partition and also organised the All Pakistan Women's Association in 1949, two years after the creation of her country. Noticing that there were not many nurses in Karachi, Khan requested the army to train women to give injections and first aid, resulting in the para-military forces for women. Nursing also became a career path for many girls. She continued her mission, even after her husband was assassinated in 1951, and became the first female Muslim delegate to the United Nations in 1952. = Second phase: 1980s = The end of 1970s heralded a new wave of political Islamisation in many Muslim majority countries. In Pakistan, the military dictatorial regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq gained power and initiated the Islamisation of Pakistan. These reforms replaced parts of the British-era Pakistan Penal Code, making adultery and fornication criminal offences, and introducing the punishments of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death. The feminist movement in Pakistan highly opposed this implementation of Islam, which was they believed to be based on an archaic understanding of Islamic literature, asking instead for liberal modernist interpretation. After much controversy and criticism, parts of the law were considerably revised by the 2006 Women's Protection Bill. In this context, the vocal Women's Action Forum (WAF) was formed in 1981 According to Madihah Akhter, General Zia ultimately sought to morally police the role of women in the public sphere, which brought unexpected pressure on Pakistani women. As a reaction to the form of Zia's Islamisation, many Pakistani women, including writers, academics, and performers, became active in the opposition of these policies. Akhter argue that the younger generation of 1980's activists were more feminist in their outlook and approach; the Women's Action Forum, she says, used \\"progressive interpretations of Islam\\" to counter the state's implementation of religiously interpreted morality, and in doing so, succeeded in gaining the unexpected support of right wing Islamic women's organisations too. They campaigned through various mediums, such as newspaper articles, art, poetry, and song = After Zia: 1988‚Äì2008 = Since the end of General Zia's rule, Pakistan elected its first female prime minister - Benazir Bhutto. Some feminist legislative attempts were made, such as the founding of all-women police stations, and the appointing of female judges for the first time. Many of anti-feminist laws of General Zia era remained. Post-Zia, activists have been able to produce research that has focused on strengthening the political voice of women, and inclusive democratic governanceShaheed et al., 2009; Zia, 2005; Bari, 2015. They have also produced some of the first Pakistani research and awareness-raising material on the sexual and reproductive rights of womenSaeed, 1994, environmental issuesSadeque, 2012; Hanif, 2011, and citizen-based initiatives for peace between India and Pakistan.Sarwar, 2007 = 2008 ‚Äì Present = The feminist movement in Pakistan entered a crucial period after 2008 with the advent of private media channels and social media. The movement gained momentum as women were increasingly able to share their ideas and beliefs. Aurat March (Women Marches) are now held in numerous cities over the country. The subjects and issues raised by the marches include homosexual rights, transgender rights, non-binary rights, rape, the education of women, and workplace harassment. The contemporary movement has increased its vocal opposition of religious extremism and conservative religious values. This vocal criticism of religious institutions and the patriarchal construct of religion has generated criticism and counter-movements too, examples of which being the Haya March and Nisaism. Currently two types of feminism exists in the country.  Liberal Feminism in Pakistan  Liberal Feminism is most prominent in leftist liberal circles, and is often supported by left-leaning political parties such as PPP. It is often characterised by liberal values of freedom, liberty, human rights and secularism and has been one of the most vocal supporters of LBTGQ+ rights and marriage in Pakistan.  Nisaism  Nisaism is more traditionalist in nature and supports the acquisition of women rights under an Islamic lens. The movement is mainly supported by centrists and the right-wing parties of Pakistan. The word Nisaism comes from Surah Nisa, a chapter of Qur'an, demonstrating the Islamic roots of the movement. The movement has faced some criticism for preaching Islamic rights and accepting what other feminist groups call the 'Islamic patriarchal structure of Pakistan'.  Feminist Art and Literature in Pakistan  Much of Pakistani femininist art and literature struggles against orthodox advice literature, known for imposing religious dogma through puritanical reform; feminist authors often describe the journey of feminism in Pakistan as an oscillating battle, where women's movements struggle against the continued backlash of the patriarchal hegemony. According to Shahbaz Ahmad Cheema, the Pakistani patriarchy produces literature and art with the ultimate goal of making women accept, internalise, and promote patriarchal discourse as an ideal. Afiya S Zia identifies some of the writings she considers to be most problematic, such as those of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan; Ashraf Ali Thanawi's Bahishti Zewar; and, in post partition times, Abu Ala Maududi‚Äôs writings, which she considers to intend to create and sustain a privileged Muslim class, further facilitating and supporting patriarchal male dominance. Television and Film likewise continues to present submissive and subservient Pakistani women in a male- dominated Pakistani society. S.S. Sirajuddin in the Encyclopedia of Post- Colonial Literature in English, expresses reservations about the availability of free space for feminism in Pakistan, and feels that the nation is still much affected by religious fervour. However, she admits that an awareness of feminist concerns, the changing role of women, and female identity do exist in Pakistan, and these concerns are reflected in Pakistan's English literature. Perception and intervention of major female characters can be observed in novels like Bapsi Sidhwa, and Sara Suleri's Meatless Days. Pakistani poets like Maki Kureishi, Hina Imam, Alamgir Hashmi, Taufiq Rafat have been considered to be sensitive but restrained in their portrayal. One of the first feminist films in Pakistan was called Aurat Raj (Women's Rule). It was released in 1979, but failed to achieve at the box-office despite the fact that released in a successful period for Pakistani cinema = Rashid Jahan = Rashid Jahan (1905‚Äì1952) was an Indian writer who inaugurated a new era of Urdu literature written by women with her short-stories and plays. She is remembered for her short stories depicting the sexual agency of women, notably the collection, Angaaray (1931). The book railed against social inequity, hypocritical maulvis and the exploitation of women in patriarchal society. Of the two pieces that Jahan contributed to Angaaray was Dilli ki Sair; a narrative about a burqa-clad woman watching life on a railway platform waiting for her husband to turn up and take her home. The story meditates on life 'behind the veil' and the blindness of male privilege towards the experience of women behind the purdah. The other piece, Parde Ke Peeche, is a conversation between two women from affluent, sharif (respectable) families. Muslim orthodox clergy in the then united India opposed the book, forcing publishers to withdraw it. The British government too preferred to ban the book for its own political convenience. = Ismat Chughtai = Beginning in the 1930s, Ismat Chughtai wrote extensively on themes including female sexuality and femininity, middle-class gentility, and class conflict, often from a Marxist perspective.

Three were built and one had some success in a 1928 international contest. Another was later re-engined and provided with cabin accommodation. Design and development The RK.25 was noted by contemporaries for its speed, aerodynamic cleanness, its use of new light alloys and, with a range of , its suitability for long distance touring. It was a low wing, cantilever monoplane with an engine choice between a Cirrus II or a Cirrus III, both four-cylinder upright air-cooled inlines. Success in the upcoming first Challenge International de Tourisme would offer publicity and its points system benefited designs with high performance, high structural strength and low weight. Its wings were trapezoidal in plan, though with long, rounded tips. Their thickness reduced outwards, largely from below, contributing to the significant dihedral. Structurally, the wings were wooden, each with two longerons which were joined into a box spar by plywood skin out to three-quarter span; this appears dark in the photograph above. The rest of the surfaces, including the unbalanced ailerons which occupied about half the span, were silk covered. The ailerons had frames of elektron, a recently developed magnesium alloy. The RK.25's upright Cirrus engine was neatly cowled in weight-saving elektron, following the upper cylinders to minimise their obstruction of the pilot's forward view. The fuselage had a welded steel tube structure with fabric-covered sides and underside and a curved top which continued the narrow upper engine fairing dorsally. There were two open cockpits in tandem, one occupied by the navigator over the rear wing and the other by the pilot, behind the trailing edge. Its tail was conventional, with wooden structures and tapered, round- tipped surfaces. The elevators and the leading edges of the rudder (there was no fin) were ply-covered boxes, with silk elsewhere. The tailplane's angle of incidence could be adjusted on the ground for trimming but its elevators were unbalanced. A large balanced rudder reached down to the keel and worked in an elevator cut-out. The RK.25 had a traditional fixed undercarriage with a track of , its mainwheels on a single axle supported by a pair of V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tops of the forward V-strut members were joined transversely by a beam, free to slide vertically between pairs of fuselage members but restrained by sets of rubber rings which also circled the wing structure as it crossed the fuselage. The second RK.25 (registered D-1701) was fitted with a Cirrus III engine, the improved cylinder head cooling of which required a slightly wider and raised cowling. It also had raised cockpit sides. In 1932 the first prototype (D-1489) was rebuilt as the RK.25/32 for the Challenge International de Tourisme 1932. This had an enclosed cabin with large side and upper glazing panels, inboard Ksoll slotted, camber-changing flaps and independent, faired undercarriage legs. It was powered by a Argus As 8 air-cooled, four cylinder, inverted inline engine and had a maximum speed about . Operational history The date of the RK.25's first flight is not known, though the prototype was registered in September 1928. It and the second example competed in the 1929 Challenge; the latter, with its more powerful engine and flown by John Carberry, came third. A third and final RK.25 was registered to Luftfahrtverein Ruhrgau (Ruhrgau flying club) of Essen in 1933. The RK.25/32 took part in the 1932 Challenge, though it was late and only admitted after the payment of a fine. It performed badly in the tests before the tour, coming last of forty-one and engine problems forced it out of the tour at Rimini.

Before the beginning of the work, the directors agreed that everything is to be done together, each one has an opportunity to veto on any decision, but only every other day. Initially, another actor was invited for the role of Korostelyov. However, the artistic council of the association did not approve this and recommended Sergei Bondarchuk to them. The young directors did not believe that Bondarchuk would agree to act in a directorial debut. But after reading the script, Sergei said that he liked the role. The beginning of the shooting was scheduled for September 1959. Since the action of the picture takes place in the summer, it was decided to build the set in Krasnodar, where autumn has a large number of sunny days.

Description  It was just last year..., by artist Richard Ross, consists of three photomurals containing a total of 108 photographs of the people and environments in the neighborhoods served by Eskenazi Health as a ‚Äúdepiction of the community‚Äôs collective memory.‚Äù Inspired by T.C. Steele‚Äôs murals of the four seasons, originally created as part of the City Hospital mural project in 1914, which featured both professional artists and students working together, Ross, along with his daughter, Leela Cyd Ross, gathered together teams of student photographers to take photographs within the neighborhoods surrounding the hospital. In the fall of 2012 and spring and summer of 2013, using a Diana camera, the student photographers, including elementary school, middle school, high school, college undergraduate, college graduate students, and hospital staff, produced photographs of the people, landscapes, and buildings of Indianapolis neighborhoods. The photographs were then developed, printed, scanned, and retouched before Richard Ross selected 108 images to be used in the final work. He curated three large photomurals ‚Äì one for each season in which the photographs were taken. Each mural measures 72\\" x 303\\", unframed. Of the project, Ross explains: ‚Äú‚ÄôCollective Memory‚Äô serves as a great theme for the work. We wanted to create a series of 'tiles' that would reference the world that surrounds the hospital and make it a familiar and comfortable space. While people filled with the tension of awaiting hospital services sit waiting, they could explore and 'solve' the references of ambiguous yet alluring images. Our goal was for the artworks to transform the new space into a warm, welcoming, familiar environment for staff, patients, and visitors. To achieve this we collaborated with students from Marion County, ensuring the artwork truly belonged to the community it would reside in. We selected sites in the immediate environment that the community‚Äôs population would recognize. The final selects represented animals from the zoo, objects from surrounding museums, dogs and children in the neighborhood, swimming pools, the state fair‚Äîa broad swatch of images that would reference the world just beyond the hospital.‚Äù -Richard Ross  Historical information  = Acquisition = It was just last year... was commissioned by Eskenazi Health as part of a re- imagining of the organization's historical art collection and to support \\"the sense of optimism, vitality and energy\\" of its new campus in 2013. In response to its nationwide request for proposals, Eskenazi Health received more than 500 submissions from 39 states, which were then narrowed to 54 finalists by an independent jury. Each of the 54 proposals was assigned an area of the new hospital by Eskenazi Health's art committee and publicly displayed in the existing Wishard Hospital and online for public comment; more than 3,000 public comments on the final proposals were collected and analyzed in the final selection.

Description  Balance is a 2013 glazed ceramic wall installation designed by artist Tim Ryan. The work is composed of two large panels, each which measure 4' x 15', framed, and feature blue and green glazed, patterned, triangular tiles surrounding a path of red grout in which white egg-shaped forms are embedded. While all clay features were made using high-fire stoneware clay, three different techniques were used to create the forms. The blue and green triangular tiles are hand-rolled and slab-cut; a ceramic extruder was used to make the thin, raised dividers; and the white egg-shaped forms were thrown on a pottery wheel. Ryan conducted workshops with Eskenazi Midtown Community Mental Health Center, and participants helped to create the triangular tiles featured in the work. To install Balance, the tiles, grout, and eggs were attached directly to the wall before surrounding the panels with a frame. Of the installation, artist Tim Ryan explains: ‚ÄúBalance is an abstract work of art, intended to be visually interesting enough to invite a deeper look, finding personal patterns and significance. I think that the egg shape absolutely expresses this intersection of perfectly geometric and organic as well as hard edged triangles and soft texture.‚Äù  Historical information  = Acquisition = Balance was commissioned by Eskenazi Health as part of a re-imagining of the organization's historical art collection and to support \\"the sense of optimism, vitality and energy\\" of its new campus in 2013.

Each of the 54 proposals was assigned an area of the new hospital by Eskenazi Health's art committee and publicly displayed in the existing Wishard Hospital and online for public comment; more than 3,000 public comments on the final proposals were collected and analyzed in the final selection. Balance is credited \\"In honor of Eskenazi Health Midtown Community Mental Health Art Program.\\" = Location = Balance is located in the Multispecialist Waiting Room on the 6th level of the Eskenazi Outpatient Care Center on the Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus in Indianapolis, Indiana.

The incident occurred at the Red Arrows' home base, RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, England. The initiation of the ejection seat was assumed to be by accident. The parachute on the seat did not deploy and Cunningham fell, still strapped to the seat, to his death away from the motionless aircraft. In January 2018, in the prosecution brought by the Health and Safety Executive, Martin-Baker, the manufacturers of the seat, pleaded guilty to a breach of health and safety law regarding Cunningham's death. On 23 February 2018, Martin-Baker were fined ¬£1.1million. Early life Cunningham was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1976. His family moved to the United Kingdom in 1986 when he was nine years old and settled in the Ernesford Grange area of Coventry. Cunningham attended Ernesford Grange School and learnt to fly, gaining his pilot's licence at the age of 17. Despite a promising career in football, after university Cunningham joined the Royal Air Force in 2000; it had been his boyhood dream to fly with the Red Arrows, the RAF's aerobatic display team. He had flown with No. 617 Squadron and No. 100 Squadron of the Royal Air Force before being selected to join the Red Arrows as 'RED 5' in May 2011. Accident On 8 November 2011, Cunningham (who was to fly as RED 5), was crewing-in to his aircraft, a Hawk T1, callsign (XX177), to undertake a training flight and a transit to RAF Valley in North Wales. As the team were out of the display season (which normally ends in September), they flew up to three times a day, five days a week for continual professional training. During Cunningham's aircraft's pre- flight checks the ejection seat initiated at 11:06 am, which resulted in the canopy being shattered and the seat with Cunningham strapped into it being jettisoned into the air. After reaching a height of the drogue parachutes deployed (one was across and the other ) which were designed to allow the seat to stabilize itself in mid-air. As the seat fell back to earth the main parachute failed to deploy to slow the descent to a safe speed, and he fell to his death in the malfunctioning ejection seat. Cunningham was airlifted to Lincoln County Hospital by air ambulance, but was declared dead there at 12:14 pm. Cunningham died after what the coroner called \\"non-survivable injuries\\" to his brain and cardiovascular system. This model of ejection seat is a zero- zero seat; this is because it is designed to be activated whenever there is an emergency, whether at speed or at zero speed and zero altitude. The incident led to a grounding of many aircraft that the Royal Air Force were operating at that time, especially all variants of the Hawk aircraft. The Martin-Baker ejection seat used (Mk.10B1) was also fitted to other aircraft besides the Hawk, though many were cleared as being fit to fly in the days after the event. The Red Arrows were given their airworthiness back by early December 2011. (While other aircraft have the Mk.10-series seat, only the Hawk retains the Scissor/Drogue Shackle parachute release mechanism, the RAF having refused to upgrade the seats in 1984. Therefore, the Hawk seats are not at the recommended manufacturer's build standard). The seat did not act in the sequence that it was supposed to; after ejection from the canopy and a ceiling height is attained, the seat is supposed to drop away and a main parachute deploy to allow the pilot to drift back down to the ground. A bolt had been over-tightened which meant that the sequence could not complete properly. It was noted that the initiation of the ejection seat was almost impossible to do accidentally, with senior officers from the RAF at a loss to explain how it happened. The Service Inquiry into the accident found that the Seat Firing Handle (SFH) safety pin, had been displaced on an earlier flight (4 November 2011) and re-inserted incorrectly so as to appear that it was in the safe position, especially if viewed vertically from above, which is the normal stance when looking at the ejection seat for both aircrew and groundcrew, but actually it was in an unsafe position. As the aircraft was not used between 4 November and 8 November 2011, the cockpit was unsafe for four days. It was believed that straps from a previous sortie had pulled the SFH loose. Inquest A pre-inquest hearing was held in August 2013, where the coroner heard that Flight Lieutenant Kirsty Stewart, a fellow pilot on the Red Arrows, had a related incident at RAF Valley where her seat straps had gone throughout the ejection handle and dislodged the SFH, putting her at risk. The inquest was heard at Lincoln Cathedral Centre in January 2014. This had been delayed due to Lincolnshire Police conducting their own criminal investigation in the incident and passing the case file to the Crown Prosecution service (CPS) who decided that no-one would be prosecuted as there was insufficient evidence to suggest anyone had breached their duty of care. The inquest heard about the incident and the events leading up to it, including how Cunningham had taken Night Nurse (a brand of sleeping drug in liquid form) the night before and how moments before crewing-in, he accepted a 49-second call on his mobile phone from an estate agent about a house sale. Two medical officers submitted testimony that disagreed with each other about the effect of Night Nurse on Cunningham's alert state. One stated that Night Nurse contains Promethazine, which can cause \\"drowsiness, poor vision, loss of concentration and cognitive impairment\\". The other stated that it was \\"highly unlikely\\" that the dose taken would have had any effect the following day. Before crewing-in, Cunningham and some of the other aircrew were waiting for the engineering paperwork to be completed and it was stated that Cunningham appeared \\"in good spirits\\", and that he was \\"buzzing with excitement at flying to RAF Valley and an overnight stay with four friends\\". The inquest also heard how a squadron leader who had returned to the Red Arrows after being away for four years was surprised by the lack of engineers for the squadron, the operational tempo (especially given the age of the aircraft) and the relative inexperience of the engineers, some of whom were on their first tour. There had also been pressure on the pilots to perform at a greater number of events. For the 2012 season, the number of hours flown had been dropped from 3,000 to 2,500. The coroner described the seat mechanism as being \\"entirely useless\\". Seven personnel had nineteen opportunities to check the position of the SFH between its final flight on 4 November and the incident, and none of them, including Cunningham, had determined the SFH to be misplaced. One senior aircraftman who was working that day gave evidence at the inquest about how he had not seen any problems with the ejection seat when he looked at it and that if the seat pin was in the seat, then it was deemed safe. He said \\"I still believe it's not possible, or shouldn't be possible, for those other positions. To me, an ejection seat should have two settings: safe or in use.\\" One of the last things that a pilot does when crewing-in before take-off, is to remove the safety pin(s) so that the seat is \\"live\\". The safety pin on the seat could also be mis-aligned, which when viewed from a normal vertical downward angle, means that it looks to be in the 'safe' position, but would not be. This means that the yellow and black strap that sits between the pilots legs (the SFH) can be pulled upwards sharply and the seat will deploy. The SFH can also be pushed accidentally into a downward position, so that any amount of downward pressure upon it will allow the ejection to activate. The coroner was critical of Martin-Baker, who knew about how the bolt that retained the drogue parachute was not to be over-tightened as far back as January 1990. Martin- Baker had informed some operators of the Mk10B1 seat (including many military air forces worldwide) not to over-tighten the bolt, but had not informed either the MoD or the Royal Air Force. An assessment carried out by the MoD after the incident stated that the event would occur only every 115 years. It was revealed prior to sentencing that Martin-Baker had passed this information to MoD before 1990, so had no obligation to do so again in 1990. In court, it was claimed MoD never had this information, from 1952 on. An RAF training film, MoD Air Publications and aircrew & engineer witnesses, proved otherwise; but the Health and Safety Executive advised the judge that this was irrelevant.Red 5 ‚Äì An investigation into the death of Flt Lt Sean Cunningham (David Hill) https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VTN8NVZ Aftermath and prosecution Martin-Baker have since designed a small metal plate to go over the SFH which prevents accidental firing. This had been proposed a number of times but always rejected by MoD. Additionally they have created a new bolt that cannot be over-tightened and will hold the main parachute in place until the ejection seat is initiated and stabilised. This shoulder bolt had previously been removed from the Mk9 seat design, with the MoD's agreement. Training on ejection seats in the Royal Air Force was changed after this event. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced in May 2013 that no-one would be prosecuted over the incident, but that the Health and Safety Executive might pursue a prosecution. In September 2016, The Health and Safety Executive announced that they would be pressing ahead with a prosecution of Martin-Baker under Section 3(1) Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. A pre-trial hearing was conducted in February 2017, where the company pleaded not guilty. A trial was scheduled to commence in January 2018, at which Martin-Baker pleaded guilty to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. According to Martin-Baker's solicitors (Clyde &Co;) they were advised to plead guilty to 'avoid upsetting MoD'.RED 5 ‚Äì An Investigation into the death of Flt Lt Sean Cunningham (David Hill) https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VTN8NVZ As part of the guilty plea, Martin-Baker agreed to pay court costs amounting to over ¬£550,000 but refuted the prosecution's allegation that what happened was \\"not an isolated incident\\".

It's you that I see, from my wonderful, beautiful afar, I see YOU.\\" These lines were written by a writer while living in Italy.

The former railway station was built together with the construction of the Tarnowskie G√≥ry - Katowice - Czechowice-Dziedzice. After World War I, and the division of Silesia, the station's significance increased. In 1929-30, the two oldest buildings from 1872 and 1900 were demolished, and replaced by a new railway station building with a platform hall, in the place of the former round engine house from 1872 and a depot for the transit of cargo from wagons on narrow-gauge railway and normal track gauge.

Description  Synchronicity of Color, an installation by artist Margo Sawyer, consists of a total of 31 square and rectangular forms, which vary in size and depth, producing a layered effect. Of the forms, 23 are wall-mounted and eight are inset within the corridor between the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital and visitor parking garage. These boxy forms are constructed of steel and are painted with various automobile paints in varying colors - including dynamic color paints, which give the impression of changing color when viewed from different angles - a nod to Indianapolis‚Äô rich history in racing. Synchronicity of Color takes its inspiration from Jung‚Äôs conception of synchronistic events, the idea that ‚Äúmeaningful coincidences‚Äù are created if subjects occur independently yet seem to be related in a meaningful way. While the individual forms exist separately from one another, their shared scale, rhythm, and repetition create a singular, cohesive experience. The inset of specific forms reinforces this connection, as well as expands the work into the architecture of the hospital corridor.  Historical information  = Acquisition = Synchronicity of Color was commissioned by Eskenazi Health as part of a re-imagining of the organization's historical art collection and to support \\"the sense of optimism, vitality and energy\\" of its new campus in 2013. In response to its nationwide request for proposals, Eskenazi Health received more than 500 submissions from 39 states, which were then narrowed to 54 finalists by an independent jury. Each of the 54 proposals was assigned an area of the new hospital by Eskenazi Health's art committee and publicly displayed in the existing Wishard Hospital and online for public comment; more than 3,000 public comments on the final proposals were collected and analyzed in the final selection. = Location = Synchronicity of Color is located in the West Corridor of the Eli Lilly and Company Foundation Concourse in the Eskenazi Health Outpatient Care Center on the Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital campus in Indianapolis, Indiana.

The opera describes life in a multi-religious and multi- cultural metropolis. It was premiered by the Bavarian State Opera, conducted by Kent Nagano, on 27 October 2012. Background and performance history The stage work Babylon was written by J√∂rg Widmann on a commission by the Bavarian State Opera. The opera was composed from 2011 to 2012. Librettist and composer were not held to any restrictions. The librettist Peter Sloterdijk describes life in a multi-religious and multi-cultural metropolis, the rise and fall of an empire. The Bavarian State Opera presented the world premiere of Widmann's Babylon, conducted by Kent Nagano on 27 October 2012 in National Theatre Munich. The production was directed by (La Fura dels Baus). A revised version of the opera was premiered on 9 March 2019 at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden Berlin. Conductor of the new production by was Christopher Ward, replacing Daniel Barenboim. In the revision Widmann used live electronics for the first time at the end. The first performance of Widmann's Babylon Suite, a commission of Grafenegg Festival and Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, took place on 21 August 2014 in Grafenegg under the direction of Kent Nagano. The Babylon Suite is the concertante version of Widmann's opera. Reception The premiere of Babylon was reviewed critically by several newspapers. The New York Times noted that Widmann's hard work received a major forum, that Sloterdijk's libretto is overstuffed and often inscrutable, and the production is extravagant. Die Zeit wrote about an indifferent libretto, a monstrous score and old men's lust (), S√ºddeutsche Zeitung about howling wind players, opulent pictures and strange music. Die Welt wrote: \\"alphabet soup of sound salad: orgiastic, bombastic\\" (\\"\\"). The premiere of the revision of the opera in 2019 received positive and mostly negative \\"icely\\" reviews. Music Babylon is a polystilistic opera. Example of a special musical style is Widmann's version of the Bayerischer Defiliermarsch and Tiroler Holzhackerbuab\`n from his composition Dubairische T√§nze in Scene III. Some other examples of self-quotation within the opera are Teufel Amor, Con brio, Antiphon and Messe. The work is characterized by cinematic editing techniques and various multimedia layers.

Early life and family Hannah Borden Palmer Hannah Chambers Borden was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, on October 8, 1843. Her father was a Presbyterian clergyman, Edmund Woodmansee Borden (1822-1893). On her mother's side, Margaret Hopper (1823-1901), she descended from Andries Willemszen Hoppe (1622-1658), who was among the first settlers of Manhattan Island. She was the oldest of a family of eight children, the four surviving siblings were: Almira C. Rice (1845-1934), Emma L. Borden (1848-1872), Edmund James Borden (1852-1927), Flora E. Exelby (1864-1941). Edmund Woodmansee Borden was the second son of Tyler and Hannah Borden and was born in Monmouth county, New Jersey on March 30, 1822. When twenty years old he married Margaret Hopper of New York City and with her moved to Michigan in 1843, at the time a pioneers land. He died on February 27, 1893, after fifty-three years of ministry. He is buried with his wife at Forest Hill Cemetery (Ann Arbor, Michigan). At the age of sixteen Palmer entered Albion College, in Albion, Michigan, and after a three-year course of study took her master's degree, M. A. 1862. Career After graduation Hannah Borden Palmer began to teach in the union school in Lapeer, Michigan. In 1864 Palmer accompanied her husband to the front with his regiment, camping with them until the muster-out in September 1865. After that home duties and the care of her children occupied her time until the crusade began. She was elected president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of Dexter, Michigan, under whose guidance and auspices were organized a public library and reading-room. She opened a private school in Colorado, which she conducted with success until she moved to Buffalo, New York. Mainly through her efforts, a lodge of Good Templars was organized in Boulder, Colorado, and she was its presiding officer for five successive terms. Her love for children induced her to organize a Band of Hope, which soon grew to nearly two-hundred members. During that time she became a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Boulder and soon received the gavel. In the spring of 1886 business led her husband to Buffalo, in the practice of his profession. Seeing in the Royal Templars what she believed to be a fruitful source of great good, she united with that order, serving as chaplain, vice-councilor and select councilor. After three years as select councilor of Advance Council No. 25 she declined reelection. Her council sent her as its representative to the Grand Council in February 1890. On her first introduction into that body she was made chairman of the committee on temperance work and was elected grand vice-councilor, being the first woman to hold that position in the jurisdiction of New York. In the subsequent sessions of the Grand Council in February 1891, and February 1892, she was reelected grand vice-councilor, being the only person ever reelected to that office. Personal life In November 1864, Hannah Borden married Dr. Elmore Palmer (December 16, 1839 - October 23, 1909), son of Layton Palmer, then surgeon of the 29th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Dr. Palmer wrote a lengthy series in 1908 and 1909 about Albion History in the Albion Mirror newspaper entitled \\"Biographical Sketches\\", which provided valuable information about the early history of Albion. Palmer attended the Albion public school, and the Albion Seminary and Albion College. He graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor as a medic in 1864. His uncle, Dr. Alonzo B. Palmer was dean of the medical school there. In 1881, after the death of all four of her children, she moved to Boulder, Colorado, and then in 1886 to Buffalo, New York, always with her husband. They lived at 309 Plymouth Avenue. She spent the last 5 years of her life at the Episcopal Church Home and died from arterial sclerosis on January 26, 1940. She was buried as a pauper at the Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo) with no headstone together with her husband's ashes.

It is consecrated to the patron of miners ‚Äì St. James.  History  The church of St. James the Greater was first mentioned in documents, which are dated to 1256, when the previous church, which stood in its place, was burned down. In the same year the construction of the new church began. In 1257 the presbytery was completed, since the main altar of St. Nicolaus was consecrated in the same year. The consecration was carried out by the bishop Bruno of Schaumburk, who also promoted the church to parish. The first priest in the newly ordained church was Stephen, one of the prominent figures in the history of medieval Jihlava. The construction of the church continued in the next decade. Church of Saint James the Elder, historical photography The completing of the northern (higher) tower of the church is documented at the end of the 13th century. With its height of 63m, its function was also as a watchtower at that time. This tower is used as a lookout tower nowadays. The whole city suffered a great fire in 1353 and this fire apparently damaged the parish church too. The large repairs of the church are dated back to 1373-1379. At that time, a three-aisled nave was completed and topped with a cross-ribbed vault. A spiral staircase on the south side and a floor above the sacristy were built at that same time as well. The southern tower, which had the function of a belfry, was built in the 1430s. An important point in the history of the church was the year 1436, when the Mass was served to the occasion of the proclamation of the Compacts of Basel, during the presence of the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. Jihlava was struck by another big fire in 1523, the church of St. James, including both towers, was heavily damaged too. Subsequent repairs lasted over 40 years. The southern tower began to lean dangerously and to deflect from its axis in 1548. It was necessary to reduce its height to today's 54 meters. A new big bell was hanged and consecrated in 1563 and it was called Zuzana. It is the second largest bell in Moravia until nowadays. The church went through the Baroque style changes in 1702, the chapel of The Mother of Sorrows was added to the northern side of the church, and it was separated from the main nave by the decorated Baroque grid. A general reconstruction of the church was made in a Purist spirit at the end of the 19th century, during which the roof got new covers. Several static supports of the northern tower were carried out by August Wolfholz company in 1922. The interior was modified in 1987, by removing the inappropriate Art Nouveau decoration. The church of St. James the Greater was declared a national cultural monument on April 28, 2008.  Architecture  = The interior = The interior of Saint James the Elder church The interior of the church is built as three-aisles, the main nave is followed by a chancel, which has a polygonal pentagonal closing. The side aisles end in short rectangular closings. The three aisles of the temple and the presbytery are topped by cross ribbed vaults. The closing of the chancel has a radial vault. The ribs are carved in a decorative shape, with slightly bevelled edges, and joined in the flat circular keystones at the apex of the vault. Ribs in the chancel continue to the heads, which are closing simple or bundle round shafts. The vault above the three aisles is supported by four massive polygonal pillars and ribs ends in pyramidal brackets on the walls. The chancel is opened to the nave by a massive triumphal arc. There is a huge choir with organs above the entrance hall of the church. The entrance hall is also topped with a cross ribbed vault. = Decoration of the interior = The temple's chancel is covered with a large number of frescoes and medieval paintings. The vault is covered in paintings with Neo-Gothic ornaments, the walls are painted with scenes from the life of St. Bernard. The church is equipped with several Baroque gilded altars. The monument of the church is a 7.5m high painting of \\"Decapitation of St. James\\", which decorates the main altar. Its author, one of the painters of Empress Maria Theresa, J. N. Steiner, was born in Jihlava. In church are kept sculpture treasures - a unique pieta from 1330, the statue of St. Catherine of Alexandria from the beginning of the 15th century and the late Gothic statue of St. James from the 16th century. An interesting artefact is the modern replica of the P≈ôemyslid cross. The original is dated to 1330 and is now located in the picture gallery of the Strahov Monastery. The replica is there to remind, that the original was hung in the church of Jihlava. Church of Saint James the Elder, supporting buttresses = The exterior = The church is currently without any external plaster; walls consist mainly of quarried stone from local quarries. The buttresses are made from larger blocks of the local stone, bricks are used in some newer parts of the building. Only the highest floor of the tower and the Mother of Sorrows chapel are plastered at the current time. The walls of the church are mostly supported by one stepped buttresses on the outside. The walls of the chapel and the aisles are decorated with tall, slender lancet arch windows, which are divided by vertical rods. Windows are decorated with tracery, mostly filled with complicated curved shapes with a flame motive. The main entrance to the church is through a portal, which is from the early gothic period. There are slender columns with crowded plate pedestals in the corners, topped with shaped capitals. Tympanum is smooth, lined with multiple archivolts. Few smaller portals are similarly conceived, preserved also in the northern and southern walls of the church. The northern portal columns are decorated with folk decor and perhaps with grapes, compared to the other portals. The walls of the church are unconventionally decorated with gravestones from the cemetery, which originally surrounded the church. On the eastern side there is a Baroque statue of John of Nepomuk. The Mother of Sorrows chapel, interior = The towers = The towers of the parish church belong between the most visible buildings monuments in Jihlava. Today's shape of towers is the result of many reconstructions and adaptations over the centuries. The north tower now measures 63 meters and serves as a lookout tower. The gallery is located 40 m above the ground and offers a wide view of the surroundings. The original tower had a pyramidal roof and a mural painting in the front. After many fires, the two towers were rebuilt and finished with baroque onion dome. The southern tower was reduced to today's height of 54 meters. = The Mother of Sorrows chapel = In 1702 the Chapel of the Mother of Sorrows was built at the northern side of the church, separated from the interior of the church by a richly decorated baroque grid. The ceiling is in a form of wedge-shaped rib vaulted. The chapel has two portals with and semi- circular windows. It is decorated with lunettes and a polygonal lantern hanging in the middle. The walls are divided by pilasters, which supports the continuous entablature. The chapel has a rich stucco decoration. Its author is Giacomo Antonio Corbellini. The decorations of the chapel are by V√°clav Jind≈ôich Noseck√Ω. The entrance to the Baroque Mother of Sorrows chapel is through a richly decorated portal. In the Mother of Sorrows chapel there is an altar from the first half of 19th century. There is a Pieta in the centre of the altar, from the second half of the 14th century. It is richly decorated with statues of saints.  Interesting facts  = The legend about the bell Zuzana = The burghers of Jihlava, who wanted to show off their richness to the surroundings, invited a famous bellsmen Brikci of Cinperk to create a bell for them, which would become famous across the whole land. They promised him a nice amount of coins, if the work would be successful. And so the great bell was created in the fortification moat near the Virgin gate on the day of St. Michael in 1563. When the metal was melted in the big boiler, women and girls, young and old, sinful and pious came and threw gold chains, rings, jewels and hardly earned and speared coins into the boiling melt. All of this slowly disappeared in the forge. The biggest amount of coins donated a woman named Zuzana. It was 1840 golden coins, to redeem herself. As soon as the bell, baptized by the name of James, was hung on the tower in 1563, Zuzana sat on a chair between the temple doors and let it ring. And since then everybody refers to the bell as Zuzana, although its name is James.

Kolb's research focuses on the organization and functions of the cerebral cortex. In 1976, Kolb's PhD thesis established the utility of employing rats for study of the prefrontal cortex in medical research. opening up a new venue for non-primate animal research in the prefrontal cortex and accelerating the development of new treatments that help victims of disease and cerebral injury. He was the first to demonstrate how the regrowth of brain cells accompanies restoration of brain function and also the first to show, with Terry Robinson, that psychoactive drugs change neuronal structures and networks permanently and in a manner such that later neuroplasticity is altered. Kolb has contributed extensively to the literature of neuroplasticity during development and in response to experience, drugs, hormones and injury; including how these changes influence behavior. Kolb's 1980 textbook Fundamentals of Neuropsychology, co-authored with colleague Ian Whishaw, helped define the field of neuropsychology and as of 2015 is in its seventh edition. Kolb has published over 400 articles and chapters including co-authoring popular textbooks in neuropsychology and behavioral neuroscience. He is a professor of Neuroscience and holds a Board of Governors' Research Chair in Neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge. He is a primary investigator at the Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience which he was key in establishing. In 2016 Kolb was inducted as an Officer of the Order of Canada. Early life and education Bryan Edward Kolb was born in 1947 in Calgary, Canada. Kolb's father Jack Kolb was actively pursuing success in the Calgary's burgeoning oil industry in the 1950s, and his mother Virginia was a professional dancer turned stay-at-home mother. From a very early age Bryan gravitated to precision measurements. In school he excelled in science though struggled with English and history. He later attended the University of Calgary planning to enter law school after obtaining an undergraduate in Psychology. However Kolb became fascinated by the work of eminent human brain researchers such as fellow Canadians Brenda Milner (with whom he would later work) and Wilder Penfield who performed lesion studies. He completed his studies in Calgary with both Bachelor of Science (1968) and Master of Science (1970) degrees in Psychology. Kolb completed his PhD in Psychology in 1973 at Pennsylvania State University, under the supervision of John Michael Warren. While working with Warren, Kolb wondered whether lesion studies of the human prefrontal cortex could be extended to non-primates such as rats. If this were true using non-primates could facilitate research for illnesses such as Parkinson's Disease. For his thesis, Kolb demonstrated that rat possessed a prefrontal cortex. This finding accelerated the rate of learning for lesion studies of the prefrontal cortex opening up a new more cost and time effective vehicle for animal studies research that prior to this time had been largely confined to more costly and more time-consuming studies of non-human primates. Professional career and leadership Kolb returned to Canada to do postdoctoral work in electrophysiology with Cornelius Vanderwolf from 1973‚Äì75, followed by additional postdoctoral work at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) at McGill University studying brain-injured patients with Brenda Milner. He was offered a research position at the MNI from Milner but chose instead to accept a professorship at the University of Lethbridge (U of L) where he could pursue his own research focusing on the comparative physiology of the rat and human diseases including Parkinson's Disease, Stroke and developmental disorders. He has remained at the U of L ever since. Kolb is likely best known for his textbook, Fundamentals of Neuropsychology, as of 2019 in its seventh edition and in multiple languages, which he wrote with his longtime colleague, Ian Whishaw.Kolb, B. & Whishaw, I.Q. (2015) Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, 7th Edition. New York: Worth-MacMillan. Originally published in 1980, this book was the first in the new field of neuropsychology and has been described as \\"the book that defined the field.\\" The book is said to be \\"the most stolen textbook in England\\". Kolb and Whishaw also co-authored the entry level textbook An Introduction to Brain and Behavior now in its sixth edition. As of 2017, Kolb has also published five other books, and over 400 papers and chapters. Kolb was influential in transforming the originally 5170 m2 Life Sciences Building on the campus of the University of Lethbridge into the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience. The Centre has been an integral part of establishing the University of Lethbridge as the top rated university in Canada for undergraduate research. Kolb is a theme leader for the Canadian Stroke Network and an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia and University of Calgary, as well as the Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Calgary, Alberta. Kolb has served as president of the Experimental Division of the Canadian Psychological Association, President of the Canadian Society for Brain, Behavior, and Cognitive Science and is senior fellow of Child & Brain Development for the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Research While working with Mike Warren at Penn State, Kolb became interested in the prefrontal cortex. Warren was doing work comparing the prefrontal cortex of cats and monkeys, which led Kolb to wonder if rodents had a prefrontal cortex. A seminal paper by Christiana LeonardLeonard, C.M. (1969). The prefrontal cortex of the rat. I. Cortical projection of the mediodorsal nucleus. II. Efferent connections. Brain Research, 12, 321-343 provided an anatomical basis for this possibility, leading to Kolb's demonstration that rodents have frontal areas that appear homologous to prefrontal areas in the primate.Kolb, B. (1984). Functions of the frontal cortex of the rat: A comparative review. Brain Research Reviews, 8, 65-98Uylings, H., Groenewegen, H., & Kolb, B. (2003) Does the rat have a prefrontal cortex? Behavioural Brain Research, 146, 3-17 Although the rodent prefrontal cortex is millions of evolutionary years removed from that of primates, including humans, his work showed that laboratory rodents could provide a useful model for studying cognitive, motor, and emotional functions of the prefrontal cortex. In parallel, Kolb began to study the role of age in understanding the effects of early brain injury and he published seminal papers showing that the effects of early brain injury varied exquisitely with the precise age and that at certain ages there was remarkable neuronal plasticity leading to functional restitution whereas at other ages the outcome was abysmal,.Kolb, B. (1995). Brain plasticity and behavior. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence ErlbaumKolb, B., Mychasiuk, R., Muhammad, A., & Gibb, R. (2013). Brain plasticity in the developing brain. Progress in Brain Research, 207: 35-64. Later studies with longtime colleague Robbin Gibb showed that both pre- and post brain injury treatments at all ages could enhance functional recovery. Kolb was the first to show that some treatments stimulate neurogenesis in the neocortex, which underlies some of the recovery.Kolb, B., Gibb, R., Gorny, G. & Whishaw, I.Q. (1998) Possible brain regrowth after cortical lesions in rats. Behavioural Brain Research, 91, 127-141.Monfils, M.-H., Driscoll, I., Kamitakahara, H, Wilson, B., Flynn, C., Teskey, G.C., Kleim, J.A., & Kolb, B. (2006) FGF-2-induced cell proliferation stimulates anatomical, neurophysiological, and functional recovery from neonatal motor cortex injury. European Journal of Neuroscience, 24 ,740-749. In recent years his research focus has shifted more to the examination of how environmental events, including drugs, stress, hormones, and learning differentially affect brain and behavior at different developmental ages by altering neuronal morphology, gene expression, and ultimately behavior. His work on the effects of drugs on neuronal morphology, in collaboration with Terry Robinson (University of Michigan), was the first to show that the physical structure of neurons becomes altered by addictive drugs, thus showing that drugs physically alter brain systems.Robinson, T.E. & Kolb, B. (2004) Structural plasticity associated with drugs of abuse. Neuropharmacology, 47 Suppl 1, 33-46. Awards and honors Kolb has been given four honorary degrees and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (2000). He is also a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (1983), Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) (1984), Association for Psychological Science (1985), and the Canadian Society for Brain, Behaviour, and Cognitive Science (CSBBCS) (2017). In 2000, he was awarded the CPA's Donald O. Hebb Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology as a Science and in 2002, the CSBBCS's Donald O. Hebb Distinguished Contribution Award.

The K√∂nigsberg Amber Factory had its origins in the second half of the 19th century, when the Stantien & Becker company leased the Palmniken quarry from the government. Stantien & Becker introduced industrial methods to amber mining, by employing steam-powered excavators. The East Prussian government terminated the company's lease in 1899, granting amber extraction rights to the state-owned Koeniglichen Bernsteinwerke. In the same year, Stantien & Becker started an amber processing operation in K√∂nigsberg, which employed 600 workers by 1912 and processed about 80 tons of amber. The amber business was purchased by Preussag AG in 1924. After the Nazis gained power in 1933 the government centralized the management of amber extraction and production to Berlin. In general, however, they were uninterested in boosting amber production, preferring to focus investment on military industries. After the end of World War II the company came under Soviet ownership, and was re- established in 1947; over the following decades the enterprise developed successfully, using forced labour,There were two gulags: one for men working in the mine, the other for women, employed in the factory.

Hydraulic mining continues to the present day. The Walter quarry was opened in 1912. When its resources had been depleted in 1976 the new Primorsky quarry was commissioned, where mining continues to this day. The project envisaged a more modern technology of amber mining and processing, with the use of a multi-bucket excavator for excavating amber rock into a concentrating factory by using sea water. The company was privatized during the early 1990s, but the decision was annulled by the Kaliningrad Regional Court due to the unique nature of the company. In 2015 it was transferred to the state corporation Rostec with a presidential decree. In 2015 it had 1.3 billion rubles in revenues, and extracted 310 tons of amber.

It is located in the neighborhood and former separate city, Zemun, and for decades was one of Zemun's and Belgrade's most popular restaurants, due to its panoramic position above the Danube and being synonymous with good service and quality food. Opened in 1913, it is in the process of being declared a cultural monument. It has been described as the \\"bohemian hub of Zemun...the crossroads of many generations of fishermen, artists, journalists and politicians\\", and a \\"symbol of Old Zemun and Old Belgrade\\". It is credited with \\"symbolically connecting two towns, even before the official merger\\". Despite the \\"iconic\\" status it achieved in over a century, in April 2019 \\"Venecija\\" was transformed into the Chinese restaurant \\"Lotus\\".  Location  Situated on the southeast slopes of Gardo≈°, the restaurant is located in Zemunski Kej, in the neighborhood of Donji Grad. It is placed on the very bank of the Danube. The official location of Venecija is 6 Kej Osloboƒëenja.  History  = Origin = The restaurant was opened in 1913 by Aleksandar ≈†trajher (1861-1913), a reputable merchant, landowner and rentier, who was also a deputy mayor of Zemun. He opened it in the newly built summer pavilion next to the, now defunct, Zemun's port authority. The pavilion was made of wood and constructed by Josip Bogner. Originally a fish restaurant, it soon became famous for its fish soup and a good ambience. Apart from the local guests from Zemun, being located right next to the port building, the restaurant had a constant influx of visitors. Even though Zemun and Belgrade were at two different states at the time, Austria-Hungary and Serbia, respectively, it soon became popular among Belgrade's elite. Many sportsmen, authors, journalists, actors and actresses opted to go through the complicated border procedure just to come to Venecija, either by boat or train. They included actors Ilija Stanojeviƒá, Dobrica Milutinoviƒá, Bogoboj Rucoviƒá and Svetislav Dinuloviƒá, writers Branislav Nu≈°iƒá and Bora Stankoviƒá, journalists Darko F. Ribnikar and Jovan Tanoviƒá, actress Zorka Todosiƒá, etc. Popularity among Belgraders lasted until July 1914, when the World War I broke out. = Interbellum = After the war was over in 1918, the pavilion, basically constructed as the temporary edifice, was demolished. A new, ground- floor building was constructed instead. It had a large terrace, partially above the Danube, which was built on stilts. Because of that, the restaurant got its name (Venecija, Serbian for Venice). Managed by the leaseholder Sima Ivanov, the restaurant became even more popular during the Interbellum, as both Zemun and Belgrade were now in one state, and in 1934 Zemun lost a separate city status and became part of Belgrade. Daily guests mostly included local inhabitants who would play chess or dominoes. In the evenings, the Belgraders would arrive and it was a matter of prestige to bring your out-of- town guests to Venecija. = After 1944 = After the World War II, Venecija remained the most popular restaurant in Zemun for a long time. The restaurant was noted for its panoramic position overlooking the Danube and for the quality food and service. The restaurant was nationalized after 1945 by the new Communist authorities and became part of the \\"Central\\" company, which also comprised, among other facilities, one of the most famous hotels in Zemun, \\"Central\\", founded in 1894. Due to its position, the restaurant, and especially the terrace, were always flooded during the high levels of the Danube, so several attempts were made to construct Zemunski Kej in such a way to protect the restaurant, and Zemun in general, from flooding. When hydroelectrical plant ƒêerdap I began to fill its reservoir in the late 1960s, due to the backwater of the Danube, underground waters in Zemun and New Belegrade got elevated and the cellars of the buildings got flooded. To prevent this, the high embankment with the promenade was built in 1967 so the Danube rarely flooded the quay (most notably in 1981). In September 2007 reconstruction of the quay‚Äôs long section began including further elevation of the embankment, widening of the pedestrian path and construction another one on separate level, completion of the cycling path, etc. Works, which were the first works on any embankments in Belgrade since 1990, were finished in 2008.Politika daily, 27 September 2007, p.26 Works continued in 2010-2011. After being elevated by one meter in 1967 to the point , embankment was further raised to the points in 2010 and in 2011, thus preventing any further floodings as the recorded water level was never higher than that. Over of the embankment was first solidified with of different materials, then consolidated with beams and further elevated with of sand, gravel and stone. As of 2017, the restaurant is away from the bank, separated from the river by the promenade. = Decline = The company was privatized in July 2007 and the quality of the service fell drastically and it appeared that the restaurant became part of criminal activities, typical for the Serbian transition economy. The private owners changed soon, and it turned out that the latter owner leased the restaurant to his own company. On 1 October 2010, the owner filed for bankruptcy and the state appointed the bankruptcy manager. In August 2011 the state annulled the 2007 privatization and the company became a state property again. In December 2012 the bankruptcy was officially declared and in June 2013, instead of celebrating 100th anniversary, the restaurant was closed due to the financial situation. The state then leased the restaurant to the \\"Planum\\" company in November 2013. State opted for leasing at this moment because the heirs to the pre-war owners of Venecija applied for restitution, which legally blocked the selling of the premises. \\"Planum\\" re-opened the restaurant in January 2014 after extensive repairs as parts of the restaurant were ruined. In August 2017, the state decided to sell the restaurant. This prompted stories about the real leaseholders of \\"Venecija\\" as news reports claimed that one of them was Predrag Rankoviƒá Peconi, one of Serbian \\"controversial businessmen\\". Peconi, with his associates, was mentioned as the leaseholder when in March 2017 his legs were bullet-riddled in a shootout in another of his properties, hotel \\"Prag\\". Ownership of the Venecija was mentioned as a possible reason for the shootout. The first attempt at selling the venue in September 2017 failed. The state estimated \\"Venecija\\" to 105.3 million dinars (‚Ç¨880,000) but no one offered to buy it. In December 2017, the state offered \\"Venecija\\" once more, this time for 95 million dinars (‚Ç¨795,000), but after two contestants finished the bidding, the price rose to 110 million dinars (‚Ç¨920,000) and the new owner became Swiss entrepreneur Johan Peter Z√ºger. Without any announcement, in April 2019 the venue was adapted into the Chinese restaurant \\"Lotus\\". This caused a vocal discontent in the social media and among the residents of Zemun. A new owner is \\"Lotus Restaurant Ltd\\", owned by Chinese-Cypriot entrepreneur Aidi Jiang.APR - Lotus Restaurants d.o.o.  Architecture  The building of the restaurant covers . It is adjoined by the terrace (\\"summer garden\\") with and a covered section with . After numerous reconstructions and repairs after 1945, almost nothing of the original architecture remained. As of 2017, the pink fa√ßade is done in the rustic manner which reminiscence the \\"old kafana look\\".

He was arrested, sentenced and executed at age 35.  Life Fehrentz came from a miner's family in Saarland, near the French border, and had nine siblings. Already at age 14 he had to work in a coal mine. He left the locksmith's training in Saarbr√ºcken for economic reasons. Afterwards, he became a wandering labourer in Alsace and Luxembourg, working as a land-grabber and locksmith. At the end of the 1920s he moved to Heidelberg to live with his brother Hans. First he worked there as a shoemaker and roller shutter fitter. He was a member of the Red Sports, where he mostly did wrestling. After a motorcycle accident, he found a job as a truck driver and locksmith at the company Seppich. He married Gertrud n√©e. Blum in 1938. The couple moved to an apartment in Dreik√∂nigstra√üe and had two children. After the defeat of Stalingrad the Nazi regime exacerbated their policies against any kind of resistance inside the Reich. Fehrentz was an outspoken anti-fascist and was introduced to some members of the illegal Communist Party by his brother. He did not join the Party but he regularly met some friends at the local pub \\"Zum Neckarstaden\\" for bowling and exchanging news they heard from acquaintances or from the radio programs of the Allied forces. The group was opposed to the Nazi regime. The circle was betrayed by an informer to the Gestapo. On 10 February 1943, seven persons were arrested, including Heinrich Fehrentz, and on 26 October 1943 they were sentenced by the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart. The accusation was \\"preparation for high treason, undermining of military morale and listening to enemy radio stations\\". Six of his friends were sentenced to lengthy prison terms, while Heinrich Fehrentz was sentenced to death. Prosecutor Krebs has characterized him as a dangerous enemy of the Reich and as the leader of the group. Emilie Fehrentz remembers: \\"And then I was present there [at the trial].

Spingarn (September 1, 1908 ‚Äì August 6, 1984) was a mid-20th- century American lawyer and civil servant in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and (briefly) Dwight D. Eisenhower administrations, including Special Counsel (1949) and Administrative Assistant to Truman (1950) and lastly commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission (1950‚Äì1953) during transition to Eisenhower. Writings on the mid-20th-Century often cite his official writings during office; less often, they describe him in text. Background Stephen Joel Spingarn was born on September 1, 1908, in Bedford, New York. His father, Joel Elias Spingarn, was a professor of comparative literature at Columbia University, co-founder of Harcourt, Brace & Co., Republican Party supporter who ran for Congress in New York with an endorsement from President Theodore Roosevelt, and later chairman of the board of the NAACP. His uncle was Arthur B. Spingarn (1878-1971). Lewis Mumford was a close family friend: he bought their family home in Leedsville, New York. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He started studies at Yale University but, after working summers as a U.S. National Park ranger in the Mesa Verde National Park, decided to stay West and settled on the University of Arizona in Tucson, where he graduated in the mid-1930s and passed the Arizona State Bar. Career Spingarn served three presidential administrations from 1934 to 1953. Under Roosevelt in the New Deal, he served as an attorney in the U.S. Treasury (1934‚Äì1941): \\"In '36, I was a young Treasury lawyer, a legislative lawyer.\\" He also served as assistant to U.S. Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings (1937‚Äì38). He became special assistant to the general counsel at Treasury (1941-1942). During World War II, he served as a colonel in the 5th Army Counter Intelligence Corps (1943-1945). He later recalled: > I was a counterespionage officer during the war and I was commanding officer > of the 5th Army Counter Intelligence Corps for two years, from the end of > the African and throughout the Italian campaign. I was in the Salerno > invasion, I was at Anzio and at Cassino and at many other places, and while > I was not a combat officer I saw a lot of people get killed, close by. We > went into new cities with the assault troops and did the initial > counterintelligence work, grabbing the human targets of whom we had advance > information, and trying to grab the documents too, at the intelligence > centers and places like that, and other things. And we captured, the > counterintelligence personnel at 5th Army in the Italian Campaign, captured > approximately 525 German spies and saboteurs. They were mostly Italians, but > they were working for the German intelligence services, Abwehr and SD, which > I believe is more than any other allied army captured during World War II. I > don't have any figures on the Russians, but as far as I know it was better > than any of the Western allies, and we often modestly stated that it was > more than the FBI had caught in the whole forty years of its history. Later, he wrote articles for the Saturday Evening Post out these exploits. In 1946, after the war, he returned to Treasury as assistant general counsel (1946-1949), which meant operatively as legislative counsel on the non-tax side. He helped write a 1937 Anti-Smuggling Act. He was also legal counsel to the U.S. Secret Service and coordinator of Treasury enforcement agencies (a committee of the six heads of the enforcement bureaus, with Spingarn as legal member). He served on President Truman's Temporary Commission on Employment Loyalty (1946 ‚Äì 1947), about which he said later: > I had been the principal 'borer inner' at the meetings of the Loyalty > Commission. I had tried to get J. Edgar Hoover before the Commission. I had > prepared a list of questions for Hoover. My thesis had been, then, that > before the Loyalty Commission comes up with a program we ought to know how > big a war this is. Is it a one division war, a five division war, or a > twenty division war. We therefore need to know the real facts, the secret > information of the Department of Justice, on how widely infected with > subversives, they believed, the Government is. Facts, not speculation ‚Äì > facts. He also served as Deputy Director in the Office of Contract Settlement (1947 ‚Äì 49). > I know I made some enemies in this process, by boring in.

This has been my experience > everywhere. Every intelligence man with information won't give it to anyone > else. That's one of the troubles. It was true in the war, you know. We spent > more time fighting each other sometimes than we did the enemy, really. In Spring 1948, Spingarn questioned former Soviet spy Whittaker Chambers for one or two hours about Harry Dexter White: > Whittaker Chambers had had something to say on the subject, but I don't > believe that he ever met Harry White either. Actually, Whittaker Chambers > said later, and he told me this, because I interrogated him once in '48, I > think it was, '47 or '48, one or the other. I interrogated Whittaker > Chambers up in New York in the offices of Time magazine about these Treasury > cases, and as I recall he told me that he didn't believe Harry White was a > Communist; he believed that he was a man who thought he was smarter than the > Communists, and he could use them, but really they used him. That was just > about the way that Whittaker Chambers expressed it to me, as I recall it. > And when I said \\"me,\\" it was also to Mal Harney ‚Äì Malachi L. Harney ‚Äì who > was then the chief coordinator of Treasury Enforcement activity. There was a > Treasury Enforcement Coordination Committee, and I was the legal member of > that committee... > And Chambers said he had never met this man, but there was one reference, > way back, in the thirties, to a name, which was unusual, a first name, mind > you, an unusual name, that someone had said to Chambers that there was a > fellow with this unusual first name in the Treasury, who was one of ours, a > Communist. A very tenuous, thin thing, not even a last name just a first > name, and this was ‚Äì now we're talking about events ten years or more later, > you see. On August 3, 1948, Chambers would appear under subpoena before HUAC and name White among more than half a dozen former federal officials as part of the Ware Group ring he ran. He provided details about his meetings with White, also included in his 1952 memoir, Witness. Among those named was also Alger Hiss (friend of Max Lowenthal ‚Äì see below.) Having submitted three articles written for the Saturday Evening Post with journalist Milton Lehman on \\"How We Caught Spies\\" during World War II, Spingarn had New York City Mayor Bill O'Dwyer and producer Ray Stark, help him pitch his articles for a movie in Hollywood. Leaving Washington as the Hiss Case started, Spingarn landed meetings Buddy Adler at Columbia Studios, Sam Briskin at Paramount Studios, and Armand Deutsch at MGM Studios but failed to close a deal. In early September, President Truman's secretary called him to come home and work on the presidential election. In 1949, Spingarn became Special Counsel to the President. In 1950, he became Administrative Assistant to the President. In 1950, he became a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), where he served until 1953. After leaving government service, in 1956 he served on the Small Business Advisory Committee of the Democratic National Committee. In 1967, during an oral history interview with Jerry N. Hess of the Truman Library, he said that rival Truman associates Max Lowenthal and Matthew J. Connelly \\"knifed him\\": > Max Lowenthal was a good friend of the President's from the days in the > '30s... They became friends at that time, and he had total access to the > White House. During the McCarthy period he was there all the time, almost > daily; he used to hang out in Matt Connelly's rear office. I had had an > encounter early in my White House career with Max Lowenthal. Clark Clifford > told me that Max was worried about an Internal Security bill (of 1950). However, Spingarn also suspected that Lowenthal (and Connelly) \\"stuck the knife in me.\\" Phileo Nash told Spingarn it was Connelly, influenced by Lowenthal: > I mentioned that Max Lowenthal had once told Niles, and possibly others that > I was a Fa[s]cist, that was in 1949, because I told Lowenthal I favored > wiretapping under proper controls... Nash said it was quite possible that > Max Lowenthal was very vindictive, and he mentioned that Max Lowenthal is > currently spending much time in Matt‚Äôs office with L‚Äôs son. Spingarn further recalled: > There was an operation run, more or less, under the supervision of Max > Lowenthal in the basement of the White House which was to prepare answers to > the charges that McCarthy was hurling so freely during all that period and > get them ready in a hurry, not wait until the lie had gone around the world > before the truth has gotten its pants on. I remember Herb Maletz‚Äìgood > man‚Äìworked in that thing and one or two others whose names I can't remember > at the moment. > Max Lowenthal was very much involved in that, and in his book The Truman > Presidency, Cabell Phillips has me teamed up with Max Lowenthal in running > that operation, which is not correct. I did an awful lot of work on the > McCarthy stuff, but I did it in terms of trying to devise some machinery, or > system, or operation. Personal life and death Truman held Spingarn in high regard, as evinced by his letter to him dated December 29, 1952, which opens \\"You are performing a public service...\\" even as both the president and Spingarn were readying to leave office in the advent of the new Eisenhower administration.

Truman, who having risen to Executive Secretary to Vice President Truman and then Appointments Secretary to President Truman, was indicted for bribery in 1955, convicted in 1956, served six months in prison in 1960, and was granted a full pardon by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Career In 1930, he graduated from Fordham University and began his career as a stockbroker in New York City. =Civil service= In 1933, Connelly began civil service with federal relief agencies based in Boston and then Washington, DC. In 1935, moved to Washington. In 1938, his first job on the Hill in DC was \\"investigation of the relief program\\"‚Äìthat is, \\"the local welfare program.\\" In 1939, he joined the staff of the House Appropriations Committee, chaired by U.S. Representative Clarence Cannon and investigated the Works Progress Administration. In 1940, he joined the staff of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Campaign Expenditures, chaired by U.S. Representative Guy Gillette. There, he worked under subcommittee chair U.S. Senator J. Lister Hill \\"to investigate the Kelly-Nash machine\\" in Chicago and then the Wendell Wilkie campaign in Alabama. Senator Lister had Connelly join the Truman Committee. In 1941, he served as chief investigator of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, known as the \\"Truman Committee.\\" Investigators who reported to him included: Hugh Fulton, William S. Cole, Rudolph Halley, Walter Hehmeyer, Robert L. Irvin, Donald M. Lathrom, and Frank E. Lowe. In July 1944, he became Executive Assistant to Senator Truman. In January 1945, he served as Executive Secretary to newly elected Vice President Truman. In April 1945 through 1953, he served as Appointments Secretary to President Truman. =Bribery charges= In 1955, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Connelly and T. Lamar Caudle for accepting a bribe and conspiring to defraud the government. In 1956, he received a conviction. In 1960, he served six months in prison. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy granted Connelly \\"a full and unconditional pardon.\\" Personal and death Connelly married Doris and had one son. In a 1967 interview with Truman Library oral historian Jerry N. Hess, Stephen J. Spingarn, Federal Trade Commission Commissioner (1950‚Äì1953), suspected that Max Lowenthal and Connelly \\"stuck the knife in me.\\" Philleo Nash told Spingarn it was Connelly, influenced by Lowenthal: > I mentioned that Max Lowenthal had once told Niles, and possibly others that > I was a Fa[s]cist, that was in 1949, because I told Lowenthal I favored > wiretapping under proper controls ... Nash said it was quite possible that > Max Lowenthal was very vindictive, and he mentioned that Max Lowenthal is > currently spending much time in Matt's office with L's son. Spingarn further recalled: > There was an operation run, more or less, under the supervision of Max > Lowenthal in the basement of the White House which was to prepare answers to > the charges that McCarthy was hurling so freely during all that period and > get them ready in a hurry, not wait until the lie had gone around the world > before the truth has gotten its pants on. I remember Herb Maletz‚Äìgood > man‚Äìworked in that thing and one or two others whose names I can't remember > at the moment. > Max Lowenthal was very much involved in that, and in his book The Truman > Presidency, Cabell Phillips has me teamed up with Max Lowenthal in running > that operation, which is not correct. I did an awful lot of work on the > McCarthy stuff, but I did it in terms of trying to devise some machinery, or > system, or operation. He lived in Cicero, Illinois.

It lies to the north of the city centre on the river Oker. It is part of the Stadtbezirk Lehndorf-Watenb√ºttel. History The first mention of the village of √ñlper, then called Elbere, is in 1251. In 1642, the √ñlper Tower (√ñlper Turm) was built as an outer defence for Braunschweig and a customs post, but it was demolished in 1825 and replaced with a dance hall which still carries the name. An important part of the early economy of √ñlper was a large water mill, the √ñlperm√ºhle. At one time, the mill had eleven mill- wheels and was one of the largest mills in northern Germany. It fell out of use in the 19th century. In 1761 during the Seven Years' War, a force of Brunswick and Hanoverian troops defeated a joint Franco-Saxon force in the first Battle of √ñlper. In 1809, during the War of the Fifth Coalition, troops of the Kingdom of Westphalia attempted to block the advance of the Black Brunswickers under Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in the second Battle of √ñlper. Although the Brunswickers were unable to achieve a breakthrough, the Westphalians withdrew during the night allowing the Brunswickers to continue their march and ultimately escape to England. The village of √ñlper was incorporated into the city of Braunschweig in 1934. Recent developments have included the construction of a motorway junction in 1974‚Äì78 and the creation of the √ñlpersee, a large lake in former gravel workings.

It literally means \\"recognizing the good.\\" Etymology The Hebrew word lehakir means to recognize; The word Tov means good or goodness. History The word Jew is derived from the name given to Judah (son of Jacob), son of Jacob and Leah. The Hebrew for Judah is Yehudah, from the wording \\"I will praise\\" (odeh, Gen. 29:35). The root for this wording means \\"to thank.\\" and refers to \\"I am grateful.\\" Hakaras Hatov is an attitude and a required part of the Jewish way of life : * Your children are exhausting, but you have children. * You misplaced your car keys, but you do own a car.There's also what some call \\"there's bad, and there's worse:\\" It is internal, whereas by contrast HoDaa, giving thanks, is an action.

It was one of a series of forts stretching from the Tower of Belem close to Lisbon to Cabo da Roca. It is now a museum. History The fort was erected during the Portuguese Restoration War with Spain. It was designed as shelter for a small garrison of a corporal, three gunners and 18 soldiers, positioned to prevent landings on the coast between Guincho beach and Guia beach and thus complement the defence of the River Tagus. It permitted crossfire with the Fort of Nossa Senhora da Guia and the Fort of S√£o Br√°s de Sanxete at Cabo Raso. The fort was constructed under the direction of Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva. It was equipped with four cannons, complemented by covered bartizans in the corners and by a covered line for the musketeers. Although the inscription under the Coat of Arms on the gate specifies the dates of beginning and completion respectively as May 4, 1642 and 1648, scholars believe that a more correct period would have been from 1641 to 1643. The museum The building has been classified as a cultural heritage building since 1974. After considerable work to restore the fort to its original layout, the museum opened for the first time on March 1, 2001. Restoration was based on a dated drawing of the fort from 1796. In September 2005, the fort and museum were closed for further work in order to address structural problems, to be re-opened on February 28, 2009.

They mostly consist of a heavy and light chain of the variable region of immunoglobulin. Recombinant antibodies have many advantages in both medical and research applications, which make them a popular subject of exploration and new production against specific targets. The most commonly used form is the single chain variable fragment (scFv), which has shown the most promising traits exploitable in human medicine and research. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma technology, which may lose the capacity to produce the desired antibody over time or the antibody may undergo unwanted changes, which affect its functionality, recombinant antibodies produced in phage display maintain high standard of specificity and low immunogenicity.  Structure and characterization  = Formats = There are several known formats of recombinant antibodies which are commonly produced. These are the Fab recombinant antibodies, scFv and diabodies. Each of the formats has a slightly different potential in applications and may be used in various fields of research as well as human and animal medicine. Another researched possibility is the development of anti-idiotypic antibodies. Anti- idiotypic antibodies bind to a paratope of another specific antibody. Therefore, it can be used for measuring presence of antibodies and drug loads in patients' sera. Based on their binding specificity 3 types of anti- idiotypic antibodies can be distinguished, which partially overlap with the previously mentioned formats: the classical ones, a group including Fab fragment antibodies, antibodies binding to idiotope outside of the drug binding site and antibodies, which only bind to the already assembled complex of drug bound to the target. The most commonly used are the scFv, Fab fragments and bispecific antibodies.  Single chain variable fragment (scFv)  scFv is the smallest of the recombinant antibody formats, which is capable of antigen binding. They have a molecular weight of approximately 27kDa. They are formed by light and heavy chain of the variable region of an immunoglobulin. The two chains are linked by a flexible peptide linker. The flexible peptide linker usually consists of short sequence repetition. The sequence is made up of four glycines and a serine and it serves the purpose of stabilization of the fragment. The functionality may be enhanced by site- specific chemical modifications, adding a peptide-tag or by fusion with a gene to achieve production of bifunctional recombinant antibodies. It is important to establish the binding activity in order to ensure good functionality of the product. To determine the binding activity, ELISA assay is routinely performed.  Fab fragments  Structurally Fab fragments consist of two sets of variable and constant components, which create two polypetide chains. Together they form a stable structure. As a member of the anti-idiotypic antibodies, Fab fragment recombinant antibodies bind directly to the paratope of the target antibody. That means that they compete with the drug for binding site and have an inhibitory function. Fab fragment antibodies can be used for detection of not bound drugs or free drugs in the serum. Fab antibodies have also been used to avoid the adverse effects caused by unspecific binding of the Fc portion of the antibody, which is missing in the Fab fragment. In case the IgG immunoglobulin was more suitable for the treatment or some other particular application, experiments have also been conducted, in which the recombinant Fab fragments were converted into recombinant IgG form. This possibility further broadens the pool of potential target structures.  Bispecific recombinant antibodies  Along scFv and Fab fragments, diabodies or bispecific recombinant antibodies are the third major format. Bispecific antibodies combine two different antigen binding specificities within one molecule. The bispecific antibodies are used to crosslink the target molecules with two different cells and mediate direct cytotoxicity.  Production and development  = Production of recombinant antibodies = The production of recombinant antibodies follows principally similar workflow. It consists of determining the sequence of the desired product followed by refinement of the codon, then gene synthesis and construct generation. Once the construct is delivered to the laboratory, expression constructs are produced, then they are transferred to a cell culture in the process called transfection and once the cell culture produces the desired recombinant antibody, it is regularly collected, purified and analyzed or used for further experimentation. For recombinant antibody production the stable cell lines such as CHO and HEK293 are used. In the beginning phases of the recombinant antibody production it was important to achieve the assembly of a functional Fv fragment in Escherichia coli. The correct fold is essential for functionality of the antibody. Second essential prerequisite for the modern day production of scFv was the successful assembly of recombinant antibodies from heavy and light chain of immunoglobulin. These two experiments allowed for further development and refinement of the recombinant antibodies until modern day form.  Hybridoma  Monoclonal antibodies are essential for many therapies applied today in human medicine. The first successful technology which was robust and led to a stable production of desired antibodies was hybridoma technology. The hybridoma cell lines, which produced large quantities of relatively pure and predictable antibodies was first introduced in 1975. Since then, it has been used for various purposes scaling from diagnostic and therapeutic to research applications. Despite its indisputable role in scientific discoveries and numerous treatment strategies, the hybridoma technology presents researchers with some obstacles such as ethical issues, potential to lose expression of the target protein or lengthy production and most importantly the development of HAMA in patients as mentioned previously. Therefore, different methods need to complement or even partially replace the hybridoma. Hybridomas are an essential part of the recombinant antibody generation even today as they are still used to produce the monoclonal antibodies, from which the Fab fragments, scFv or somatically fused antibodies create a bispecific antibody.  Phage display  The most commonly applied technology to produce recombinant antibodies in the laboratory settings today is the phage display. Phage display is a method, in which the target recombinant antibody is produced on the surface of a bacteriophage. This allows for a fast recombinant antibody production and easy manipulation in the laboratory conditions. Both scFv and Fab fragment recombinant antibodies are routinely produced using the antibody phage display. From all the possible phage display systems, the most common is the Escherichia coli, due to its rapid growth and division rate and cheap set up and maintenance. = Engineering and development = Two main strategies have been described to engineer the scFv fragments. The first one is the so- called non-colinear approach. It works on the principle of heterodimerization of two chains. Non-colinear approach leads to production of diabodies and recombinant antibodies, which combine two specificities. The second approach is called colinear and it described the process of fusion of two different scFv with a biologically active protein.  Medical and research applications  Recombinant antibodies fulfill a large spectrum of functions spanning from research to diagnosis and treatment therapies for various diseases. Their specificity and low immunogenicity make them a great alternative to traditional forms of treatment, increasing the accuracy of targeting specific molecules and avoiding adverse side effects. Recombinant antibodies have been explored as a treatment for cancer, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and more. ScFv have been a part of the highly promising therapeutic approach of universal chimeric antigen receptors (uniCAR) technology, which shows promising results. The scFv are part of the technology in the form of target modules, which direct the immune response to specific cancer cells, expressing the target antigen. In case of research into HIV treatment, the recombinant antibodies are rather used for their neutralizing quality. The same goes for HSV infection. Specific recombinant antibodies are designed to bind with to surface heparin sulphate proteoglycan (HSP), which complicates or even disables the entry of the HSV into the host cell. This is a method which significantly decreases the severity of HSV infection. As was mentioned in the beginning of this section, recombinant antibodies can also be used in diagnosis, an example of such diagnostic application is the detection of rabies virus. Since the current diagnostic antibodies are not as accurate as would be desired, the recombinant antibodies offer a promising alternative. In case of rabies infection, which is only treatable shortly after exposure, accurate and precise diagnosis is vital for survival of the patient. In comparison to commercially produced and commonly available antibodies, the recombinant antibodies are cheaper to produce and more accurate in determining the infection. Another advantage of the recombinant antibody is the potential application as a neutralizing antibody as part of the subsequent treatment. The potential of recombinant antibodies in human and animal medicine is immense as shown even by the few selected examples. As mentioned previously the recombinant antibodies and especially those, which have been developed in phage display are highly specific, have great pharmacokinetics and could be used in wide range of treatments. However, it is important to realize that it is not expected or desired for the recombinant antibodies created in phage display to completely replace the hybridoma antibody production but rather to complement it.  Advantages of using recombinant antibodies  Recombinant antibodies bring many advantages with their application in human medicine and research. The first one is the complete elimination of ethical issues because there is no need for animal immunization. Thanks to their size, which is smaller than complete antibody and particularly than 2000 nm, yet not smaller than 8 nm they are cleared from the organism with ease and in a timely manner, through the renal pathway, which is the desirable clearance. Another great advantage is their monovalency, which means that they are highly specific and bind to a single antigen. Researchers have managed to produce antibodies carrying no other activity than the antigen binding. Since the recombinant antibodies are sequence defined they are more reliable as well as reproducible. In combination with their small size the great specificity can be exploited to deliver highly specific drug to a specific site precisely because the small size predisposes the recombinant antibodies to penetrate tissues more easily. It has been reported that the recombinant antibodies penetrate tumor tissue better than the full-length IgG immunoglobulins. The small size also adds to better biodistribution in the patient. In comparison to antibodies derived from hybridoma cell lines the recombinant antibodies do not cause immunogenicity, the infamous human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA). These were the top advantages for use in patients. However, the use of recombinant antibodies is also advantageous compared to traditional monoclonal antibodies derived from hybridoma cell lines during their production as well. The production is much faster and we have better control over the process than in hybridoma technology. Moreover, the recombinant antibodies may be designed virtually against any antigen, of the proper size and shape, but they are not solely limited to the peptide nature of an antigen. The recombinant antibodies may also be used in fused form with drugs and/or toxins, which may be further exploited in the medical applications. Last but not least of their advantages during production is the possibility to optimize and genetically engineer the recombinant antibodies based on the current demand of the patient or researcher.. An experienced technician is required to perform the phage display and third it is almost inevitable to include outsource companies in the process for the gene synthesis and construct generation.. However, in a systematic comparison of animal derived antibodies verus phage display derived recombinant antibodies used for research and diagnostic applications, the EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM) released a recommendation in favor of on non-animal derived antibodies in May 2020, mainly based on the fact that in contrast to animal derived antibodies, recombinant antibodies are always sequence defined protein reagents, allowing to eliminate some of the quality issues attributed to current research antibodies when made in animals.

Joseph Reade (1694 ‚Äì March 2, 1771) was a merchant, vestryman, and politician from New York. Early life Reade was a second- generation English prominent merchant. He was the son of English merchant Lawrence Reade, who arrived in New York from Saint Michael, Barbados, around 1691. His brother was John Reade. His sister, Mary Reade, was first married to William Vesey, the first rector of Trinity Church in Manhattan. After his death, she married Daniel Horsmanden, a chief justice of the supreme court in the Province of New York and member of the governor's executive council. Career Reade was prominent in New York business, political and social life. He was first a member of the vestry of Trinity Church in 1715, and later a warden of the Church, a role in which he served for over fifty years. In 1725, the same year he endorsed \\"a petition to ban the sale and export of spoiled flour\\", he was elected assessor of the East Ward of New York. Reade was appointed a member of the governor's council by then Governor of the Province of New York, Robert Monckton, in 1761, serving until his death in 1771. While on the council, he advised the next governor, Sir Henry Moore, and his Lt.

He is also known as a charity worker and a recipient of Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year award he was awarded in recognition for his work defending Lotfi Raissi who was wrongly accused of training September 11 hijackers. In 2014 Egan came to notice after successful defence of Tania Clarence who was charged with murder of her two children after her unsuccessful legal battle with social workers. After a series of defence motions, murder charge was reduced to that of a manslaughter by diminished responsibility and Clarence was given a hospital order. Career Egan qualified as a solicitor in 1990 and joined Tuckers Solicitors, law firm based in London, where he became a partner in 2001. His work is focused mainly on criminal defense. Experience Egan is a member of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association and Association of Military Court Advocates and Justice. He has gathered local attention in London for his aggressive defense style and was one of those who contended that solicitor advocates should be entitled to wear the same wig and gown in court as barristers. =Notable cases= Egan's work has included acting for: * Lotfi Raissi, Algerian pilot who allegedly instructed four of the hijackers who crashed the plane into the Pentagon on September 11. The prosecution case was that Raissi qualified in the United States as a pilot in 1997, attending the same Arizona flight school as four of the hijackers involved in the attacks September 11. Raissi was acquitted after trial. * Navinder Singh Sarao, accused of triggering a multibillion-dollar Wall Street crash, who was represented by Egan prior to and during extradition proceedings. * Surinder Pal Singh Sappal, who was the only defendant acquitted in a trial relating to insider dealing. Egan and the Special Casework team acted for Sappal on a private basis in one of the rare cases brought by the FCA for insider dealing. The prosecution alleged that the 3 defendants were involved in a plan to make illegal profits from share dealing on secret information obtained by an insider on the board at Logica, a multinational IT and management consultant agency, shortly before the business was the subject of a takeover by CGI Group Holdings Ltd, netting the defendants massive profits. Sappal was acquitted by the jury, with his co- Defendants sentenced. * Giorgina Ray, Jimmy Savile's love child. * Egan also represented Tania Clarence, a wife of an investment banker, in her defence to a charge of murder in connection with the deaths of her three disabled children. Clarence family friends said the mother had felt under constant pressure by local authority and had been ‚Äúvery derogatory about Kingston social services‚Äù. Speaking after the trial, Clarence said \\"lessons need to be learned\\" from his wife's story of \\"dedication and love\\" which turned to \\"despair and utter hopelessness\\". After the trial, in a statement issued on Clarence' behalf, Egan blamed medical professionals and social services for contributing to Tania Clarence's depression. * In another widely publicised case Egan represented Pervez Rafiq, British charity worker who was the only defendant acquitted in a trial relating to terrorism offences. Egan led Tuckers Solicitors Terrorist and Special Casework team who have secured the acquittal of Rafiq who was accused of terrorist offences whilst Syed Hoque and Mashoud Miah were both convicted of funding terrorism. Hoque was found guilty of using aid convoys to smuggle money to his nephew fighting with an al-Qaida linked group * In 2019 Egan represented Jack Shepherd who was convicted of a speedboat murder. Television and Media appearances Egan has appeared on multiple national news television programs to provide legal commentary, including \\"The Briefs\\", series which were aired on ITV in July 2013. The series gathered an audience of about 2.4 million viewers during the first show. =On-air commentary= In 2014 Egan has appeared as a guest on 107.8 Radio Jackie commenting on Tania Clarence case. Awards In 2003 Egan was received Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year Award in recognition for successful defence of Lotfi Raissi who was wrongly accused of being the architect of the September 11th atrocities.

Dugger is a mass transportation specialist who worked for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) district from 1992 to 2011, spending the last four years as BART's first female General Manager.  Early life and education  Dugger was born and raised in Alabama on a chicken farm. Dugger earned a bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1973. She also attended a program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.  Career  = Before BART (1970s to 1992) = Dugger served as a legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union. From 1982 to 1992, Dugger worked at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a variety of roles. Her role just before leaving for BART was Director of Government and Community Affairs. In an interview in 2008, Dugger credited Sig Frigand for mentoring her during her ten years at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. = BART (1992 ‚Äì 2011) = Dugger joined BART in September 1992 as executive manager of external affairs. On April 6, 1994, she was promoted to Deputy General Manager, in recognition of her skills and expertise. She initially served under General Manager Richard A. White from 1994 to 1996, and then under General Manager Thomas Margro from 1996 to 2007. Effective June 29, 2007, Thomas Margro retired from the position of General Manager, and Dugger became the interim general manager while the Board deliberated on who Margro's successor should be. The two candidates considered by the Board for the General Manager position were Dugger and Beverly Scott, a black female who was running the Sacramento Regional Transit District at the time. The board voted on Thursday, August 23, 2007, and Dugger won the vote 6-3, with Directors Gail Murray, Joel Keller, Bob Franklin, Zoyd Luce, Thomas Blalock and James Fang voting for her, and Directors Lynette Sweet, Carole Ward Allen, and Tom Radulovich voting against her. The selection of Dugger was attributed to a preference for a candidate with deep inside knowledge of and experience with BART and Bay Area politics. Dugger was also the preferred choice of Sue Angeli, who heads a union representing BART's professional employees. Dugger transitioned from interim general manager to general manager on August 23. While General Manager, Dugger managed to make BART turn a surplus through a combination of labor concessions, salary freezes, and fare increases. However, her tenure as General Manager also included the shooting of Oscar Grant, and her handling of the situation would be the subject of criticism. Dugger also lost $70 million in federal funds for the Coliseum‚ÄìOakland International Airport line. = Departure from BART and subsequent controversy = On Thursday, February 10, 2011, the BART Board of Directors held a vote at a board meeting where they voted 5-4 to fire Dugger, and then asked her to resign. The San Francisco Chronicle reported unattributed sources as saying that President Bob Franklin and directors Tom Radulovich, James Fang, John McPartland, and Robert Raburn voted to terminate Dugger, whereas Joel Keller, Lynette Sweet, Thomas Blalock, and Gail Murray opposed the termination. However, discussion of Dugger's resignation was not included in the board meeting agenda, which violated the Brown Act. Board member Joel Keller, who opposed forcing Dugger to resign, brought in district counsel Matthew Burrows to examine the legality of the vote, and Burrows agreed that the vote was illegal. The Board later admitted to the illegality of the vote. The main reasons cited by Board members who wanted to get rid of Dugger were her poor communication skills, bad interactions with the board, poor handling of the shooting of Oscar Grant, and loss of federal funding for the Coliseum‚ÄìOakland International Airport line. However, Lynette Sweet, a board member who had voted against Dugger when selecting the General Manager in 2007, said that the board decision was puzzling considering Dugger's achievement of making BART achieve a surplus. On April 13, 2011, BART announced that Dugger was quitting as General Manager, with extra compensation of $958,000 (severance of $600,000 and extra compensation of $350,000 for a smooth transition), and BART was beginning the search for a replacement. Dugger's last day at work would be April 22, 2011. On August 31, 2011, Grace Crunican, who had previously headed the Seattle Department of Transportation, became the next General Manager of BART. In 2013, it was reported that in addition to her severance package, Dugger had continued to receive money from BART to compensate for unused sick leave during her 19 years of working for BART, and that, as a result, Dugger was BART's highest paid employee in 2012 despite not working for BART. Responding to concerns raised about this, Grace Crunican, the new BART General Manager, said that the policy deserved review, but also defended the policy by noting that allowing people to accumulate vacation time for later could incentivize them to work harder while at the helm.  Personal life  While she worked at BART, Dugger lived in the Grand Lake District in Oakland, California with her husband Lou. Since her office was near 19th Street Oakland station, the closest BART station to her home, she did not take BART to commute to work, but she frequently used BART for meetings in San Francisco and to check out the condition in trains. She identified not having children as one of her biggest regrets. See also * Richard A.

She is known for juxtaposing landscapes, historical characters, and mythical figures from New Zealand and from ancient Greece, mixing the realism of 19th-century colonial prints with the more stylized designs of Greek black-figure pottery and MƒÅori wood carvings. Life and education Maguire was born in 1962 in Christchurch. She earned a BFA at the University of Canterbury in 1984, and has also studied at the Tamarind Institute in the US. She returned to New Zealand in 1987, and set up a print studio and later a print gallery there. She has also taught printmaking at the Ilam School of Fine Arts at Canterbury. Works Maguire's early printmaking work included figures, architectural elements, and (by the late 1990s) ancient Greek culture. The prints of her work on New Zealand and ancient Greece are organized into series, including: *Southern Myths (2001), which transported Achilles and Ajax into the New Zealand landscape. *The Odyssey of Captain Cook (2003‚Äì2005), which combined 19th-century historical figures such as Captain Cook and the MƒÅori chief Natai with Greek imagery. *The Labors of Herakles (2006‚Äì2008), in which Hercules takes part in New Zealand events such as the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. *Titokowaru's Dilemma (2008‚Äì2011), a dialogue on war and passive resistance between Tƒ´tokowaru and Socrates that compares scenes from The Iliad with events from MƒÅori history. In 2015 she shifted media with her series Feats, Pursuits & Endless Toil of seven painted door panels and four etchings, continuing the mixture of Greek and New Zealand themes. The works in this series were partly inspired by Maguire's experiences living through the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Collections Maguire's works are in the collections of the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the National Maritime Museum in London, and the British Museum, among others.

These enzymes can be found in animals and plants, showing distinctive functions. In animals and humans, they are involved in the degradation of peptides, such as bradykinin, neurotensin, angiotensin I, and AŒ≤ peptide, helping to regulate physiological processes. In plants, their role is related to the degradation of targeting peptides and the immune response to pathogens through Salicylic Acid (SA)-dependent stress signaling. In Arabidopsis thaliana‚Äîrecognized as a model plant for scientific studies‚Äîtwo thimet oligopeptidases, known as TOP1 and TOP2, have been identified as targets for salicylic acid binding in the plant. These TOP enzymes are key components to understand the SA-mediated signaling where interactions exist with different components and most of the pathways are unknown. Origin and name Thimet (from \\"thiolsensitive metallo\\") oligopeptidases (peptide-size restriction) have been widely studied in the Kingdom Animalia. The first TOP enzyme was found and purified from rat brain homogenates in 1983. Today, it is known that TOP enzymes are mostly distributed in the pituitary, brain, and testes of humans and rats. In plants, specifically in A. thaliana, the enzymes were more recently discovered as part of the 20S proteasome and SA-binding proteins. Different names have been used to identify this group of enzymes, such as soluble metalloproteinase, Pz-peptidase, collagenase-like peptidase, thimet peptidase, and endopeptidase 24.15. In 1992 the name \\"thimet oligopeptidases\\" was proposed by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), preserving this name. Family Thimet oligopeptidases are metallopeptidases that belong to the clan MA, subclan MA (E), family M3 and subfamily M3A. M3 family is composed by eight other members, such as neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), saccharolysin (EC:3.4.24.37), oligopeptidase MepB, oligopepetidase A, oligopeptidase F, oligopeptidase PepB, among others. These enzymes perform important functions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains TOP1, TOP2, and TOPL enzymes. Arabidopsis thimet oligopeptidases There are three types of TOPs found in Arabidopsis thaliana. TOP1 (also known as OOP, organellar oligopeptidase, TOPorg, and thimet metalloendopeptidase 1) is located in the mitochondria and chloroplasts and has the AT5G65620 gene. TOP2 (also known as thimet metalloendopeptidase 2) is located in the cytosol and has the AT5G10540 gene. The distinctive genes of these two enzymes are maintained in fruit fly, mosquito, and rice as well. Finally, TOPL (also known as TOP-like) is located in the cytosol and has the AT1G67690 gene. These TOPs are similar to those found in mammalian tissues. TOP1 and TOP2 are more similar to the mouse TOP with 28% similarity in the amino acid sequence, whereas TOPL is more similar to the mouse neurolysin with 34% similarity in the amino acid sequence. Biochemical characteristics Thimet oligopeptidases are M3 peptidases that possess the conserved sequence His-Glu-X-X-His in the amino acid sequence (as cited in Wang, 2014). The enzymes need the presence of thiol and zinc to be able of performing their functions. From the three recognized thimet oligopeptidases in A. thaliana, only TOP1 and TOP2 are the TOP enzymes involved in SA immune system response. They are able of performing their function in a wide range of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. TOP enzymes have the capacity to bind and form a dimer. They can exist as monomers and dimers. TOP1 and TOP2 are considered homologs with a 93% similarity in the protein sequence. Their structures have two domains. However, these domains are closer in TOP1 than in TOP2 due to differences in the position of helices Œ±6, Œ±9, and Œ±20 in the domain I. Because of that, TOP1 has a closed form and TOP2 an open form. Unlike TOP1, TOP2 does not contain an N-terminal serine-rich region in its sequence. Based on the localization within the cell, TOP1 is considered an organellar oligopeptidase with dual localization while TOP2 is named as a cytosolic oligopeptidase. Functions and interactions in plants =Peptide degradation= TOP1 plays a role in the pathway for degradation of unneeded peptides during importation of proteins to mitochondria and chloroplasts. This function can be explained due to changes in the closed conformation of TOP1 structure. The spheroidal shape, generating by the domains I and II, represents the catalytic cavity with a volume of ‚àº3,000 √Ö3. During the peptide degradation, the substrate binding can occur only if there is a separation of the two domains allowing the access and binding of the free targeting peptides to the cavity (active site). The enzyme substrate complex is maintained by several non-covalent interactions: hydrophobic and polar interactions. The process is limited by the peptide size. Thus, only peptides with approximately the same volume (‚àº3,000 √Ö3) can be degraded by the enzyme. Peptides that can be cleaved off are between 8 and 23 amino-acid residues. In addition, it has been suggested that TOP1 takes place in the degradation of other types of peptides. The enzyme is important for the elimination of unfolded or damaged proteins within the organelles mitochondria and chloroplasts. During the cleavage process of the proteins, the enzyme can break down peptide fragments without any strict sequence requirement but only constrained by the peptide size. TOP2 is part of the proteolytic activity that takes place in the cytosol. In A. thaliana, the enzyme has a role in the response to oxidative stress and degradation of oxidized proteins by breaking down peptides between 5 and 17 amino-acid residues. =Stress signaling and immunity response= Salicylic acid (SA), recognized as a phenolic compound, is involved in different biological processes within plants. This compound, together with other hormones, contributes to growth and development regulation. Additionally, they maintain plant immune response. In order to counter pathogen attacks and stress conditions, SA signaling activates the pathogen triggered immunity (PTI), effector-triggered immunity (ETI), and programmed cell death (PCD). TOP1 and TOP2 have shown a capacity to interact with salicylic acid and mediate SA activity in the system. In vitro experiments have shown that when these enzymes are not present or defective, the vulnerability to pathogen infection is higher. TOPs proteolytic activity is affected by their monomer/dimer relation. Oxidative environment increases the dimer form and result in proteolytic activity inhibition while reducing environments, stimulate accumulation of monomers and then favor TOP enzymes activity. Under stress condition, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases, causing damages in the photosynthesis and the PCD. TOP enzymes mediate the response to this unfavorable condition. TOP1 regulates the importation of antioxidant enzymes to the chloroplast. These antioxidant enzymes reduce the ROS levels within the organelle. It has been suggested also that TOP1 allows the importation of enzymes that catalyze SA synthesis. On the other hand, TOP2 controls the amount of signaling peptides, important for PCD, in the cytosol. Oxidative damage, such as cadmium (Cd2+) stress produces oxidized proteins that have to be removed to prevent further damage in the cell. TOP2 helps with the degradation of these damaged proteins. The enzyme degrades peptides by targeting the amino acids residues that are exposed during the stress. =Interaction between exogenous salicylic acid and thimet oligopeptidases= In plants, endogenous SA activation can be carried out by exogenous SA. Low levels of exogenous SA, considered as less than 10 ŒºM, help to reduce the damage caused by abiotic stress and increase photosynthetic activity. In contrast, high levels of exogenous SA reduce photosynthetic activity and result in cell death. This high amount of exogenous SA interacts with TOP enzymes and results in a reduction of their enzymatic activity. TOP1 and TOP2 activity is reduced by approximately 60% in presence of 5 mN exogenous SA. This phenolic compound inhibits TOP enzymes by a non-competitive mechanism where SA binds in a site different to the active site. The type of reaction is characterized for having a decrease in the maximum velocity (Vmax), whereas the Michaelis constant (Km) is maintained unchanged.

The film was produced by Affinity Entertainment and MPH Entertainment Productions and distributed by Boulevard Entertainment and IFM Film Associates. The film was released direct- to-disc on March 8, 1997 to mixed reviews. Plot A group of men, all single on their birthdays, bet $2,000 each to see who can find a girlfriend and make the relationship last for three months. In a desperate attempt to find love, Nick begins a relationship with a much older woman and Les begins an affair with a married woman. Cast * Grant Shaud as Les * Maureen Teefy as Teri * Anthony Palermo as Nick * Will Ferrell as Al * Lisa Wilcox as Judy * Nia Vardalos as Iris Reception The film has been met with mixed to positive reviews. Christopher Null of Contact Music gave the film a positive review stating, \\"For a direct-to-video movie, Men Seeking Women is far funnier than it has any right to be...\\" and \\"The key to Jim Milio's film is that he lets the three men's stories bouncing around enough to keep you from getting bored.\\" Null also praised the performances of Ferrell and Shaud. In a more negative review, Bilge Ebiri of Rolling Stone criticized Ferrell's character stating, \\"Ferrell doesn't really get to use any of his talents. Better things were on the horizon. Much better.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club criticized the plot and the performances, saying: :\\"Ingeniously tapping into the well- documented male desire to speedily form life-long monogamous relationships, Men Seeking Women, if nothing else, proves that films about pathetic male lonely hearts can be just as inept and boring as films about pathetic female lonely hearts. Of course, it doesn't help that Men Seeking Women's three leads aren't the least bit sympathetic, or even particularly interesting.\\" : References External links * * Category:1997 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American comedy films Category:Films set in 1997 Category:1997 comedy films ","title":"Men Seeking Women"},{"id":"54971218","text":"Abdelbaki Es Satty () (1973 ‚Äì 16 August 2017) was an imam in Ripoll who was born in Morocco in 1973 and arrived in Spain in 2002. On 21 August, he was confirmed to have died in an accidental explosion in Alcanar on 16 August, which began the 2017 Barcelona attacks. Satty is believed to have been the mastermind of the planned attacks and to have radicalised the twelve terrorists responsible into the Takfir wal-Hijra sect, which allows adherents to copy typically \\"Western\\" behaviour often forbidden in Islam in order to conceal their radicalisation and terror plans. However, he was also serving as an informant to Spain's intelligence agency, CNI. Previous terrorist and criminal activities Es Satty was implicated in the 2006 Operation Chacal, in which five Islamists were arrested for sending jihadis to fight in Iraq. From 2003 he had shared an apartment with Islamists connected to the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM) and the 2003 Casablanca bombings. In 2012, the imam completed a four-year prison sentence for drug trafficking in Castell√≥n. While in prison, he is reported to have established a \\"special friendship\\" with Rachid Aglif, who was serving an 18-year sentence for his role in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. He was convicted of drug smuggling in 2014 and was to be deported from Spain, but Es Satty claimed deportation violated his human rights and he remained in Spain. A successful asylum application in November 2014 facilitated him moving freely in the 26 EU countries of the Schengen area. Es Satty, who had been employed as imam at the Ripoll mosque since 2015, quit \\"abruptly\\" in June. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months in 2016, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium said that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his \\"radicalised and polarising\\" approach. Investigators believe the imam might be aligned with the Salafist movement, but this might not be unusual, as one in three Islamic prayer centers in Catalonia are. He has been described as \\"unfailingly courteous and studiously discreet\\", betraying no radicalism in his appearance and interactions with those who did not know him, and training those in his terrorist cell to also lead double lives. Barcelona attacks Es Satty had been renting a room in the house in Alcanar for four months. On 16 August, he told his roommate that he was leaving for a trip to Morocco. On 16 August 2017, the house was destroyed in an explosion. Satty and another man, possibly Youssef Aallaa, died in the explosion. Initially thinking it was an accidental gas explosion, police hours later discovered that the explosion was caused by stockpiled explosives accidentally going off. The explosive TATP and 120 canisters of butane and propane were found inside the house. There was speculation that the terrorists had intended to take trucks loaded with explosives and combustible gas to attack the Sagrada Fam√≠lia.

Ewing (March 8, 1889 - January 8, 1980) was a 20th-century American lawyer, social reformer, and politician who was one of the main authors of the Fair Deal program of U.S. President Harry S. Truman. Background Oscar Ross Ewing was born on March 8, 1889, in Greensburg, Indiana. His parents were George McClellan Ewing and Nettie Ross Ewing. In 1910, he graduated from Indiana University Bloomington. In 1913, he graduated from Harvard Law School. Career =Private practice= Ewing first taught at the University of Iowa Law School. Then, he joined a firm in Indianapolis. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Army and left as captain. In 1920, he joined the law firm of Hughes, Schurman and Dwight in New York City. In 1937, he co-founded Hughes, Hubbard and Ewing, where he remained until 1947. In 1942, he became a special U.S. prosecutor who won the conviction of William Dudley Pelley, leader of the Silver Shirts, for sedition. In 1947, he won the convictions of Douglas Chandler and Robert Best on charges of treason, both of whom had broadcast for the Nazis during World War II. =Government service= By 1940, Ewing had become assistant chairman of the Democratic National Committee; in 1942, he came vice chairman until he stepped down in 1947. In the Winter of 1946‚Äì1947, after the Republicans swept mid-term elections, Ewing began holding quiet meetings at his home in Washington that lead to formulation of Truman's Fair Deal. Participants included: Clark M. Clifford, then Truman's special counsel (later, last Secretary of Defense under President Lyndon B. Johnson); Leon Keyserling of the Council of Economic Advisers and advocate of planned economic growth; C. Girard Davidson, assistant secretary of U.S. Department of Interior; David A. Morse, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor; and Charles S. Murphy, an Administrative Assistant to Truman. In 1948, the Fair Deal helped Truman defeat Governor Thomas E. Dewey. In 1947, Truman appointed him administrator of the Federal Security Agency (FSA‚Äìnow the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). In 1948, Clifford and he were in charge of Truman's \\"whistle stop\\" tour. As head of FSA until 1952, he promoted civil rights, extended federal welfare programs, and broadened Social Security coverage. He opened the old Gallinger Hospital in Washington, DC, to African- American doctors. He advocated for a national health plan. Ewing is credited as the organizer and leader of this unofficial policy group of Truman's, though some other members changed (1947‚Äì1952). They also supported recognition of Israel (1948), Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Act (YYYY), and a \\"welfare state.\\" =Return to private practice= In 1952, Ewing returned to private law practice. In 1960, he moved to Chapel Hill, where he served as a director of the Research Triangle Foundation until 1989. From 1963 to 1967, he was also chairman of the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission. Private and death Ewing had a close, personal friendship with Truman. On November 4, 1915, he married Helen E. Dennis. They had two sons, George and James D. Ewing. She died in 1953. In 1955, he married Mary Whiting MacKay Thomas. He died of ischemia complicated by pneumonia on January 8, 1980, at home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. References External sources * Harry S. Truman Library & Museum: Oscar R.

During his time at the BBC, Huggers and his team refocused the BBC's online and technology strategy, launched iPlayer and revamped the BBC's online presence. He was credited with bringing order amidst chaos and infighting, helped by his outside perspective, while causing discontent among people for his macho attitude, leading to many being happy to see him leave. Huggers was also the subject of controversy when he submitted reimbursement requests for taxi rides for thousands of pounds, including ¬£639 for a single day of taxi rides. Huggers' departure was announced in January 2011, and his role was split into two, with John Linwood taking over technology and Ralph Rivera taking over digital media. = Intel (OnCue) and Verizon = After leaving the BBC, Huggers became corporate vice-president and general manager of the digital home group of chip maker Intel. In that role, he led OnCue, Intel's Internet TV effort.

Huggers worked from Vevo's New York City headquarters. In his role as CEO, Huggers initially planned to focus on launching a paid subscription. However, he deferred that goal in order to focus on international expansion of its localized website and apps, to better cater to the 80% of its users who were accessing its content from outside the United States (mostly through partners such as YouTube). Huggers identified as one of his main challenges making people aware of and engaged with the Vevo brand directly; as of now the majority of views of Vevo videos happen on the YouTube platform. On December 15, 2017, Vevo announced that Huggers was resigning as CEO, and Alan Price, the CFO, would be interim CEO while the Board was looking for a replacement. Price had played a similar role of interim CEO after the departure of founding CEO Rio Caraeff.

It is almost entirely made up of the areas of the city historically in Somerset, and since the abolition of the county Avon, consists of the southern suburbs in the county of Bristol. Definitions sometimes also include areas of North Somerset, including Long Ashton, Nailsea and Backwell. History South Bristol originated from the area of Redcliffe, once a separate town. In 1373 Redcliffe became part of Bristol to form the city and county of Bristol. In the 19th century South Bristol expanded to absorb Bedminster and Brislington Although it has historically and continues to this day, to be smaller than North Bristol, in the 20th century new housing estates such as Hengrove, Hartcliffe and Withywood significantly increased the size of South Bristol. These estates were mainly built on former open farmland, similar to the later development of the North Fringe, rather than by infilling of already partially built up areas, as happened in North East Bristol.Ordnance Survey map, 1885-1900 Boundaries Some confusion may occur as to the boundary between North and South Bristol as many do not realise that the New Cut is a man made channel made in the early 1800s. The boundary lies along the original course of the Avon, now the Floating Harbour as far as Totterdown Basin. The council wards located in the Bristol South parliamentary constituency are as follows, along with their population estimated by Bristol City Council in 2019: * Bedminster - 12,500 * Bishopsworth - 11,400 * Filwood - 13,800 * Hartcliffe and Withywood - 19,000 * Hengrove and Whitchurch Park - 17,200 * Knowle - 13,300 * Southville - 12,700 * Stockwood - 11,600 * Windmill Hill - 13,700 Some wards of Bristol East, including parts of Brislington, are a part of South Bristol. Furthermore, some areas of the county of North Somerset including Long Ashton, Nailsea and Backwell are also included in definitions of South Bristol. Politics South Bristol has its own parliamentary constituency, Bristol South, and has traditionally been strongly represented by the Labour Party. Transport No motorways pass through South Bristol; primary roads servicing the area are the A370 to Weston, the A38 to Bristol Airport and the A37 to Shepton Mallet and Dorset. The only railway line to pass through the area is the Bristol‚ÄìExeter line, with stations at Temple Meads, Bedminster and Parson Street. The former Bristol and North Somerset Railway passed through Whitchurch roughly following the A37 road into Bath and North East Somerset. First West of England operates bus services in South Bristol, with routes 24, 75, 76, 90, 91, 92 and 96 serving the area. The A1 and A2 Bristol Flyer routes from the city centre to Bristol Airport serve the area, along with Bath Bus Company's A4 service from Bath to the airport. In 2018/19, the MetroBus bus rapid transit lines m1 and m2 opened. The West of England Combined Authority is also investigating a potential light rail or metro line between the city centre and airport via South Bristol. Bristol's first main airport was Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport located in Whitchurch, and was in use until 1957. Future development Recent development of the Greater Bristol urban area has been primarily concentrated on the North Fringe of the city, along with the East Fringe - examples including Emersons Green; at the expense of the southern suburbs. In 2017 the South Bristol Link Road opened along the southern boundary of the city. Housing developer Taylor Wimpey submitted a proposal to North Somerset council to develop greenfield land outside Ashton Vale, a project known as The Vale. The proposal outlined plans for 4,500 homes to be built as three separate villages, but attracted criticism from the council due to it using land currently allocated to the Avon Green Belt. The former Whitchurch Airport site has been partially developed, with a leisure centre and the South Bristol Community Hospital opening in 2012. In 2019, planning permission for 1,400 homes on the former airfield was given by Bristol City Council. The West of England Joint Spatial Plan outlined plans for 2,500 new homes in Whitchurch along with an orbital road to link the A4 with the A37. These proposals are uncertain following the Planning Inspectorate's rejection of the plan in 2019.

The group was mentored by Lillie Rose Ernst, assistant superintendent of education in the St. Louis public school system. Several members of the group went on to have successful careers in the arts, notably Sara Teasdale, Caroline Risque, and the Parrish Sisters. Name Inaugural cover of The Potter's Wheel, November 1904 The name The Potter's Wheel was inspired by Caroline Risque's cover art for the inaugural edition in November 1904, which depicted a pair of potters sitting opposite one another. Williamina Parrish, who acted as editor-in-chief of the magazine, preferred to call the group the \\"Self and Mutual Admiration Society\\". Members The members of the group were in their teens and early twenties. They included: * Grace Parrish (1882‚Äì1954) and Williamina Parrish (1880‚Äì1940), respected photographers who worked together as the Parrish Sisters. Williamina \\"Will\\" Parrish was considered the leader of The Potters. Grace Parrish, Will's younger sister, was a very successful photographer. She was also a model and a violinist. * Sara Teasdale (1884‚Äì1933), lyric poet. Will Parrish played a major role in Sara Teasdale's life, helping her organize the poems for her first collection. They met in 1903 and Teasdale was among the initial members of The Potters.Collection of Teasdale's letters in the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library. * Guida Richey (b. 1881) writer, lived one block down the street from the Parrish Sisters. Grace and Guida remained close friends and often travelled together. * Caroline Risque (1883‚Äì1952) American painter and sculptor. * Petronelle Sombart (1897‚Äì1949) (artist), possessed a lyric soprano voice, and studied for grand opera in Milan * Vine Colby (1886-1971) (writer), engaged in a career of sociological and economy study * Inez Dutro (writer) * Celia Harris (writer), became a member of the faculty of Mary Institute until ill health compelled her retirement * Edna Wahlert (writer), married McCourt, published a \\"completion\\" of Coleridge's fragment, \\"Christabel\\" Mentor St. Louis educator Lillie Rose Ernst was the mentor of The Potters. The group described themselves as \\"idolatrous females worshipping a yellow-haired Amazon\\"; they called Ernst a \\"blond brute...the star of our existence\\". Some members of the group, including Ernst, are suspected to have been bisexual or lesbian. Several of the artists had known Ernst when they were students at Central High School, where Ernst taught botany. Teasdale dedicated a sonnet to Ernst which begins: Magazine July 1906 cover art by Caroline Risque; this issue includes an address by Lillie Rose Ernst The group produced The Potters Wheel magazine monthly from November 1904 to October 1907. Only one copy of each magazine was produced each month, \\"hand-lettered and hand-illustrated\\" by The Potters themselves. Contents included poetry, fiction, photographs, and needlework. The thick, textured pages of the hand- bound magazine were decorated with \\"border designs, illuminations, and watercolors\\". The cover art often sported \\"mythological or fantastical scenes, in tones resembling stained glass\\". The group circulated each issue among their peers with the expectation of receiving constructive criticism. These critiques were printed in booklets which later became part of The Potters Wheel Collection at the Missouri History Museum. The magazine attracted the attention of St. Louis newspaperman William Marion Reedy, who commissioned an article about it for his Reedy's Mirror in 1905. The Potters disbanded in late 1907 and \\"drew lots\\" to decide who would keep the magazines they had produced. Teasdale received three issues, which were eventually stored at Yale University. The Missouri History Museum was the beneficiary of 16 issues, in addition to the 12 booklets of critiques. Legacy Many members of The Potters are buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, located in St. Louis.Williamina (Plot: Block 52‚Äì53 lot 6001) and Grace Parrish (Plot: Block 52‚Äì53 lot 6001), Sara Teasdale (Plot: Block 66, Lot 2693) and Caroline Risque (Plot: Block 166, Lot 2834). Another woman related to The Potters was Zoe Akins (1886‚Äì1958). She was not officially part of The Potters, as she was too young to join the group. However, she was friends with several of the members, and became companion to Teasdale after the group disbanded. A woman related to Akins is Thekla M.

History  ERD was founded in late 2012 by Henri Alexander as an Avant-garde fashion collective, in an effort to create a French punk streetwear line based on the movements of the late 1970s and Japanese Avant-garde movements of the 1980s. One of the core precepts of the brand is high price points, with T-shirts ranging from $300 to $1,000, and haute couture jackets priced as high as $95,000. ERD consistently utilizes the business model of artificial scarcity. In this regard, all styles are sold on an extremely exclusive basis, and thus in relatively small quantities. \\"The price point is not only a marker of value, but intrinsically part of the piece itself,\\" Alexander remarked in a 2015 interview with The Guardian. He further noted that, \\"No pieces are alike and everything is limited. I have no interest in making affordable pieces for the masses.\\" Consistent with this perspective, the artist further noted in a 2016 interview with Complex Magazine that, \\"The best way for me to explain the brand is elitist, nihilist couture‚Ä¶The price point eliminates the masses, and the ideas eliminate the people who I don't want, generally, in it, due to the dark nature.\\" The originality of ERD's designs has also resulted in other brands appropriating similar designs and styles, most notably Gucci, Balmain and Vetements. ERD has made a point to be extremely particular with respect to accepting new stockists. Enfants reportedly informed stores in 2017 that if there is any evidence of carrying brands that copy ERD or feature \\"mid-level contemporary bullshit,\\" the brand will categorically prohibit those stores from carrying the brand. Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s began with just a small handful of stockists in 2012. From 2013 to 2014, the label quietly garnered a following amongst celebrities, including Jared Leto, Kanye West, Pusha T, Beyonc√©, G Dragon, Sky Ferreira, Courtney Love, Frances Bean Cobain, Justin Bieber, Guns N' Roses, and Zayn Malik. From 2015 to 2017, Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s has experienced significant business growth, notably with its garments being stocked by Barneys New York, Maxfield, SSENSE, Selfridges, 10 Corso Como, Luisa Via Roma, and Trois Pommes. The brand has also earned considerable artistic acclaim in the fashion world with Alexander's trailblazing and particularly confrontational and provocative designs. These garments have catapulted the brand to an unprecedented level. Enfants Riches Deprimes know for stealing other designers work and using for their own gain. A series of T-Shirts called \\"Bad Seed\\" are exact copies of copyrighted magazines held by Norton Records. Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s unveiled its SS18 pre-collection at Christie's Paris in June 2017, the first time in which a fashion house has shown at the historic auction house, founded in 1766.  Influences  Enfants has stolen inspiration from a variety of historical sources. In an interview with V Magazine, Henri Alexander commented that \\"As far as other painters I am really into Robert Motherwell. I'm envious of the scale of his work. Also, [the work of ] Cy Twombly, Antoni T√†pies and Jean Dubuffet‚Ä¶I find particularly appealing at this point in my life. I think those that are familiar with T√†pies' work, will see he has influenced ERD from the informality to the way he uses furniture and rags.\\" The artist has also noted being influenced by Japanese fashion designers Rei Kawakubo And Yohji Yamamoto, artist Raymond Pettibon, and punk rockers Darby Crash and Johnny Thunders.  Collaborations  Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s has engaged in a number of collaborations over the years. In 2012, the brand did a limited T-shirt release with Young & Starving, a New York nonprofit organization that works to support budding artists and curators. In 2015, the brand collaborated with Vans to create a custom classic high-top sneaker, featuring hand-drawings and \\"rebellious scribbling\\". For their Fall Winter 2016 collection, ERD collaborated with the estate of Cy Twombly to create a capsule collection featuring interpretations of the late artist's polaroid works. ERD has also had a continuing relationship with the contemporary artist and architect, Didier Faustino. His sculpture was notably featured as the centerpiece of their Paris runway show in September 2016, which premiered the brand's Spring Summer 2017 main collection. In early 2017, Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s collaborated with Daft Punk for their store at Maxfield in Los Angeles. In late 2016, Henri Alexander was introduced to Kanye West. Directly following his release from the hospital after being admitted for psychological evaluation, West was photographed in December 2016 visiting ERD's Los Angeles studio. There have reportedly been rumors circulating that Alexander and West are working on a collaboration for 2017. In July 2017, Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s launched a pop-up store at Maxfield, transforming the sprawling space into a pawn shop. The shop featured a capsule collection of archival pieces, as well as a number of new limited edition styles.

Charlie Poole taught Shelor‚Äôs grandfather the banjo, and Shelor‚Äôs grandfather in turn taught Shelor. When Shelor was four years old, growing up in southwestern Virginia, his grandfather fashioned a banjo for him from an old pressure cooker lid. His other grandfather promised to buy Shelor a real banjo if he learned to play two songs. Sam met the challenge, his grandfather bought him a Ventura banjo, and by age 10 Shelor was performing in local bands. Shelor patterned his playing and career after J. D. Crowe, Earl Scruggs, and Sonny Osborne of The Osborne Brothers. Shelor became a full time professional musician when he joined Richmond, Virginia-based The Heights Of Grass at age 19. That band eventually morphed into The Virginia Squires, featuring Rickie and Ronnie Simpkins. Shelor played six years with the band.

Folger Porter (born October 13, 1962) is an American activist who is the founder and president of Faith2Action. Biography Porter founded the now defunct website ReaganBook and, in 2003, conservative Christian ministry Faith2Action. Porter is most known promoting the pro-life movement for children in uterine. She also is an outspoken Christian, who seeks to conservative Christian values. In 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Centre designated Faith2Action as a hate group for its anti-LGBT stance. In 2017, she served as a spokesperson for Roy Moore in his campaign for the United States Senate special election in Alabama, 2017, drawing media attention for repeatedly refusing to answer direct questions about the candidate's publicly stated beliefs. She was the National Director for the Center for Reclaiming America, during 1997 to 2002, and an Ohio Right to Life legislative director. Porter has also worked for campaigns supporting George W. Bush for president; Mike Huckabee for president; Mandate to Save America; Birther Movement; and Risk Factors. Pro-Life Activism Porter's efforts supporting the passing of fetal heartbeat bills in American state legislatures has led to her being described as \\"in many ways the godmother of the heartbeat movement.\\" Prior to founding Faith2Action in 2003, she was the legislative director for Ohio Right to Life for 1988 to 1997. At Ohio Right to Life, she helped lobby for the first partial-birth abortion ban in the United States, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court in Gonzales v. Carhart. She then served as the national director of the Center for Reclaiming America from September 1997 to 2002. She has said that she joined the Center because she wanted to focus on more issues than just abortion. At the Center, she led a campaign promoting the idea that homosexuality is an individual choice. The original Ohio \\"Heartbeat Bill\\" (House Bill 493) was authored by Porter, who launched the first version of it in Ohio in 2011, and advocated for its passing; former Governor John Kasich then vetoed it twice, prior to its passing in 2019. In 2011, she played \\"testimony\\" from a fetus in legislative hearings on the bill, by projecting an ultrasound image onto a screen and showing it to legislators. Introduced in 11 states, and passed by legislatures in four more, Porter‚Äôs bill is supported by conservatives seeking to mount a challenge to Roe v Wade. Faith2Action radio show Porter previously hosted a radio show, also called Faith2Action, before it was cancelled in 2010. VCY America, the show's parent company, said it cancelled the show because Porter had expressed views too similar to dominion theology. The following week, she posted a blog post denying that she supported dominion theology. Political candidacy In 2016, Porter ran unsuccessfully against Larry Obhof in the Republican primary for the Ohio Senate's 22nd district. During her candidacy, she criticized Republican opponents for not supporting her heartbeat abortion bills. Her campaign for Obhof's senate seat was supported by Mike Huckabee. In a February 2016 video, Huckabee announced that he was supporting Porter because she would fight \\"for faith, family and for freedom.\\" Author Porter is the author of several books published by Random House, including True to Life and The Criminalization of Christianity.Author: Janet Folger; Amazon.com.

The estate traces its history back to the 14th century, but the current main building is from 1933. Oremandsgaard was acquired by Alfred Hage in 1861 and is currently owned by the fifth generation of the Hage family. It is one of the oldest organic farms in Denmark and plays host to an annual chamber music festival. History =Early history= Oremandsgaard is first mentioned in a letter of 1356, in which a \\"P√¶ther Bek√¶re\\" cedes all his farms and the village of Gedh√¶rudh (Geder√∏d) to Valdemar IV. It is unclear whether the estate was continuously owned by the crown over the next centuries until it was included in one of the 12 new cavalry districts by the crown in 1721. It is believed that the main building was destroyed during the Dano-Swedish War in 1658‚Äì1660 due to finds of rubble and weapons in the surrounding fields and also because this was the case for nearby Jungshoved. =1651-1861: Changing owners= Henrik Brockenhuus Oremandsgaard and Jungshoved were sold by the crown in 1761, when the cavalry district on Falster was dissolved. The buyer was Henrik Brockenhuus, a friend of Frederick IV. Shortly thereafter he also acquired the much larger Nys√∏ Manor. All three estates belonged to the same owners until 1795.Niels Lunde Reiersen In 1785, they were acquired by Niels Lunde Reiersen. In 1775 he had founded a successful trading house in a partnership with Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck, trading both in the East Indies and on the Guinea Coast. When he died in 1795, unmarried and childless, his estate was passed on to a foundation named Det Reiersenske Fond. Oremandsgaard was sold in 1796. It was later divided into the estates Ny Oremandsgaard and Gammel Oremandsgaard. In 1846, it was passed on to Peter Collet, a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm. =1861-present: The Hage family= Alfred Hage In 1861, Alfred Hage purchased Oremandsgaard. It comprised Ny Oremandsgaard, Gammel Oremandsgaard, Allerslev Church and 139 tenant farms. He demolished the existing buildings and constructed a new main building on the Ny Oremandsgaard estate. The main building from 1860 Alfred Hage and his wife Vilhelmine Faber took many initiatives that benefitted the community and were held in high regards by the locals. Their son, Alfred Peter Anton Hage, began to sell the tenant farms to the farmers towards the end of the century. The last tenant farms were not sold until 1919, making Oremandsgaard one of the last estates in Denmark to have tenant farms. Alfred Peter Anton Hage, like his parents, engaged in charitable work among the farmers on his estate, providing economic support for the sick, poor and children and establishing a public library. Daniel Hage took over the estate at the age of 25 in 1963. He became a pioneer of organic farming in Denmark. Today The Oremandsgaard estate also comprises 20 other buildings that are rented out. The Oremandsgaard estate covers 788 hectares of land (2011) of which 420 hectares are farmland and 362 hectares is covered by woodland. It is one of the oldest organically farmed estates in Denmark. =Chamber music festival= Oremandsgaard has played host to an annual chamber music festival.

It was originally discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana as part of a family of 17 related proteins, commonly referred to as the Theseus1/Feronia family or the CrRLK family. So far, THE1 and 5 other members in the same family of RLKs have been found to play key roles in cell elongation during vegetative growth through interacting mostly with the cell wall. Though the exact mechanism for this process is still unknown, it is thought to be very similar to, and even partially regulated by, the brassinosteroid pathway. In addition, Theseus1 has the ability to detect changes in cell wall integrity and could possibly even recognize pathogenic sequences. While the workings of THE1 and other members of the CrRLK family are understood on a general level, research of the specific interactions between them has yet to be published.  Discovery  Theseus1 was discovered, along with the other members in its family of RLKs, while researchers were attempting to describe a pathway of monitoring cell-wall stability in plant cells. It was first characterised from its interaction with a Procuste1 mutant (prc1-1). This Procuste1 mutant produces less cellulose because of alterations to the cellulose synthase site, resulting in drastically decreased cell wall elongation. When THE1 was also mutated in the presence of the prc1-1 mutant, the rate of cell elongation was increased to half-way between the normal growth and the prc1-1 only growth rate. Because of this interaction, it was named after Theseus, the mythological founder of Athens and killer of Procrustes. Theseus 1 was originally found in, and is still most commonly obtained from, Arabidopsis thaliana. Other members of the same RLK family are named according to other mythological figures, such as Feronia, Anxur, and Hercules.  Structure  Theseus1 is an 855 residue, type I transmembrane protein that has an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus. The serine/threonine kinase domain that is typical of RLKs is present on the intracellular C-terminal along with an adjacent binding site for ATP. There are also two internal phosphorylation sites that could possibly act as molecular switching sites for THE1 activation/suppression. The N-terminal contains a roughly 19 residue long dissociable sequence that is thought to be used for signaling about an issue in the cell wall. Additionally, there are a few regions on the extracellular N-terminus of Theseus1 that closely resemble the structure of ML domains in other proteins, suggesting that it could have an additional function of monitoring pathogenic response in the cell wall.  Activity  Theseus1 is normally expressed in all cells, with increased expression in tissues that are expanding. The enzymatic activity of THE1 can be described on its own, but most of its actions happen in coordination with other members of the CrRLK family, most of which have yet to be described let alone given a proven mechanism. = Sensing Changes in Cell Wall and Pathogen Response = Theseus1 is commonly believed to be able to detect changes in the cell wall and respond to perturbations. This thought has been applied to a few different scenarios. First, it has been considered that THE1 detects fragments of cell walls, and then signals for the inhibition of cell elongation. Another proposition is that THE1 responds to changes in the cell wall composition before signalling for the inhibition of cell elongation. Both fragmentation and alternate composition of the cell wall are commonly due to the presence of pathogens. The final commonly supported idea is that THE1 could just directly identify the presence of pathogens themselves though the use of its ML domain- like regions. All of these ideas support the theory that THE1 is part of the cell's response to pathogenic activity. Also, THE1 has been shown to upregulate the same genes that are regulated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and code for defense-related proteins, which further suggests that THE1 plays a role in pathogenic response = Vital for Cellular Elongation = Theseus1 and other members of the CrRLK family are important to cellular elongation. In particular, Theseus1 and Hercules1 (HERK1) have shown to perform similar roles in the process of elongation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants with a loss-of-function mutation to only one of these proteins will maintain a similar growth rate to the wild-type plant. However, if both proteins are mutated, the plant displays a greatly inhibited growth rate. Though the specific mechanism that causes this is unknown, it can be seen that these proteins are redundant but necessary for regular vegetative growth. Additionally, both THE1 and HERK1 function in coordination with the brassinosteroid pathway with a slight regulatory overlap between the two. = Regulation by Rate of Cellulose Synthesis = Theseus1 has been shown to regulate cell elongation in response to decreased cellulose synthesis. The most commonly described example of this is in coordination with the procuste1 mutant for decreased cellulose synthase activity (prc1-1). When prc1-1 is present, THE1 greatly inhibits cellular elongation; however, when a less- functional mutant of theseus1 was used in combination with prc1-1, the growth rate increased to somewhere between the natural growth rate and the THE1 repressed growth rate. This shows that while a cell is able to expand further with decreased cellulose levels, THE1 represses elongation because of the change in the rate of cellulose production. This is also thought to be another method of pathogenic response, as some pathogens inhibit cellulose production.

Davis (August 28, 1900 - April 17, 1995) was an American politician from Illinois who served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1943 until 1979 making him the longest serving African American member in the body's history. Early life Davis was born on August 28, 1900 in Warren County, Mississippi on a farm near Vicksburg, Mississippi. His family relocated to the Vicksburg city proper for access to educational opportunities. He attended Tougaloo College and graduated with the Class of 1917. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War I and fought during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He served in the 92nd Division with the 318th Medical Detachment. He returned to Vicksburg, but left after watching the lynching of a childhood friend. In August 1919, he joined his family, who moved to Chicago to escape violence in Mississippi. He joined Quinn Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church and eventually rose to become an assistant pastor. He continued his military service as a member of the Illinois National Guard until an honorable discharge in 1931. After working as a shipping clerk he joined William L. Dawson's political organization. Initially a Republican like Dawson, both he and Dawson played a prominent role in persuading Chicago's African Americans to join the Democratic Party during the realignment of African American voting behavior from the Republican to Democratic parties. In 1939, Davis ran for the Chicago City Council in Chicago's 2nd ward. Earl B. Dickerson defeated Davis in the Democratic primary. Dickerson defeated William E. King in the general election to become the first African American Democrat to serve on the Chicago City Council. Illinois House of Representatives Davis was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1942. When he first arrived in Springfield, Illinois he was turned away from the hotel and resorted to staying at the train station. In protest, Abraham Lincoln Marovitz, Illinois's first Jewish State Senator, joined him at the train station. During his tenure, he backed cost of living increases for welfare recipients and many civil rights measures with a focus on fair employment practices. When former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and Democratic Minority Leader John Touhy took a seat on the Cook County Board, Davis became the subject of a draft effort by fellow African American House members including Harold Washington, Raymond W. Ewell, and Lewis A. H. Caldwell. Around this time, there was a similar push to elevate Cecil A. Partee to the position of President of the Illinois Senate. Partee was elevated to the Senate presidency while Davis was appointed to the leadership team of Democratic House Minority Leader Clyde L. Choate. In 1975, just months after Democrats regained the majority in the House, Davis resigned his position in leadership after he was ignored during a debate on the Equal Rights Amendment by Speaker William A. Redmond. In 1977, he announced he would not seek reelection to the Illinois House of Representatives. The Democratic slate for the 22nd that year consisted of Quentin Goodwin, an attorney, and Larry Bullock, a former independent Democrat. At the time of his retirement from the Illinois House of Representatives, he was its most senior member. =Civil Rights= In 1946, Davis assisted the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a group of African American teachers in Cairo, Illinois sue the district over a two to one pay disparity with the district's white teachers. Observers cite his speech against a bill which would have required clinical treatment for fathers accepting welfare benefits who had a \\"more than an adequate\\" number of children as one of his most memorable. Davis was chair in 1963 of the Illinois Emancipation Proclamation Commission and a delegate to the National Black Convention in 1972. Post legislative life In 1979, Davis was appointed to the Chicago Board of Elections to replace Howard Medley after the latter's appointment to the Chicago Transit Authority Board. Two years later, he was one of two individuals appointed by Michael Madigan to serve on the 1981 deccenial district reapportionment committee. In 1986, he and the board's Republican member, voted against a resolution to switch to nonpartisan mayoral elections. Mayor Harold Washington opposed the resolution, believing it was designed to hurt his chances at reelection in the 1987 mayoral election. Chicago switched to nonpartisan municipal elections in 1999. Davis died on April 17, 1995 at age 94. In 1989, his grandson, Albert C. Maule, was appointed President of the Chicago Police Review Board. Maule would serve in this position until his October 1995 death and is survived by his wife Adela Cepeda, a finance executive, and daughters (Davis' great grandchildren) Alexis Maule, Alicia Maule, and Laura Maule.

History James Pile (c. 1799 ‚Äì 19 March 1885) was born in Beverley, Yorkshire and left Scotland for South Australia aboard Anna with his wife and family and brother George, arriving November 1849 and settled at \\"Beckwith\\" near Gawler. He was until 1852 licensee of the Old Spot Hotel on Murray Street, Gawler. He acquired a considerable area of land at Gawler East and Gawler South, as well as properties at Munno Para East and Nuriootpa, which he stocked with horses and cattle droved overland from Sydney. Around 1850 he was involved with the explorer John McKinlay, who became something of a family friend. McKinlay settled for a while on Yambro station on Lake Victoria station, and on his recommendation James Pile around 1860 took up land with western frontage on the Darling River, which became Cuthero station, of and Netley stations. A year or two later he sold the Netley station to Joe Dunne (c. 1827‚Äì1874) who drowned in Menindie Creek, while rescuing his horses, and his brother John (c. 1832‚Äì1893). Around the same time he also acquired Polia station. At first they stocked Cuthero (perhaps named for a type of acacia bush) and Polia with horses and some 1,200 cattle. When his sons reached adulthood he left to them management of the properties, and built for himself a fine house \\"Oaklands\\" in Gawler East, where he retired, was appointed Justice of the Peace and served as a Town Councillor and Elder of the Presbyterian Church. McKinlay died at \\"Oaklands\\" in 1871. Around 1870 the sons turned their attention from cattle to sheep, which thrived and soon they had built up their small flock to some 200,000.Then came the \\"seven years' drought\\" 1880‚Äì1886, and their numbers fell to 12,000. The sons ran the stations until 1899 when, in the grip of the Federation drought, the lease was resumed, was sold to Ben Chaffey in 1909, who later sold it to Arthur Crozier. ;William Second son William Pile was born in Glasgow, and emigrated with his parents. At the time of the Victorian gold rush, he drove sheep to Ballarat, where he sold them for a handsome profit. William \\"Willie\\" Pile became manager of Polia station, and served as the local magistrate. A keen racing man, he was a member of the South Australian Jockey Club (SAJC)'s first committee, and owner of The Assyrian, Country Girl and First Water (winner of the 1880 Adelaide Cup and the 1881 Australian Cup). For a time his horses were trained by J. Eden Savill, but after Savill sued certain members of the SAJC committee, Pile included, he withdrew his patronage and a year later sold his stables, horses and all his stock. Savill bought The Assyrian, which went on to win the 1882 Melbourne Cup. He subsequently joined the Adelaide Gun Club, which in the days before clay pigeons used live birds as targets. He had a hobby farm at Morphettville close to the racecourse and the Holdfast Bay railway line (now a tramline), and there built a pigeon tower with boxes for 700 birds, which became a well-known local landmark, and deliberately made larger and taller than that of \\"Ben\\" Rounsevell nearby. ;John Born in Scotland, he emigrated to South Australia with his parents and was educated at Gawler, where he encountered Dick Holland, with whom, at age 13 or 14, he made his first overland droving trip from Sydney to Adelaide with horses, and made his next trip with John McKinlay, who shortly afterwards took over Lake Victoria Station. He managed Cuthero station after the retirement of his father. He retired to \\"Netherby\\", Mitcham. He was a notable racehorse owner and prominent member of the Adelaide Racing Club. His horses also raced successfully at Gawler, Wentworth, Wilcannia, Menindee, Broken Hill, Albury, Wagga Wagga and Hobart. Mahdi, Havelock and the steeplechaser Confidence (which won an Australian Grand National) were among his best horses. In May 1897 he sold all his racehorses. Seth Ferry purchased Havelock and Joe Carr bought Confidence. Died at his home, High Street, Glenelg. ;Charles Charles was the Piles' youngest son, and emigrated with his parents. He was educated at the school run by L. S. Burton (c. 1823‚Äì1895). He worked on Cuthero station, and while mustering cattle discovered the Hide family, whose five children had died of exposure and dehydration just a few hundred metres from the river. He returned to \\"Oaklands\\", Gawler, where he died, intestate. Other reports have him dying at South Terrace, Adelaide. He is not to be confused with Charles Ogleby Pile, Magistrate and Justice of the Peace of Bulahdelah on the Myall River.

It first aired on November 8, 2000 on the ABC network in the United States. The episode's plot sees Drew (Drew Carey) open an employment agency, but he has trouble finding jobs for his friends Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader). The episode was written by Brian Scully and directed by Gerry Cohen. It was conceived after the success of the first live Drew Carey Show episode, which aired the previous year. Improvisational segments were added to a basic plot, and producers chose to keep many elements of the episode a secret from the cast. The episode was performed live three times for the Eastern/Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones. It featured guest appearances by several Whose Line Is It Anyway? cast members and talk show host Jay Leno. \\"Drew Live II\\" was seen by an estimated 15.2 million viewers, finishing just outside the Top 20 in the ratings for the week of November 6‚Äì12, 2000. It was the sixth highest-rated show on ABC that week. Production mixer Klaus Landsberg was recognised for his work on the episode with a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Plot Drew (Drew Carey) returns to the Winfred-Louder department store to speak with his former boss Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) about his rejected unemployment claim. Wick tells him that he should not have quit his job, but Drew argues that he was fired. Mr. Wick tells him to take it up with the assistant director of personnel, which was Drew's former job. They go back and forth, until Drew gives up and Wick declares to the other employees that the show is over. Drew's co-worker, Eugene (Colin Mochrie) does not join in with the applause and tells Wick that he thinks what he did to Drew was cruel, so Wick fires him. Drew vows to help Eugene find a new job, before deciding to open his own employment agency. Drew's friends Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) tell Drew that they are unhappy in their current jobs, so Drew offers to recommend them for mystery diner positions at Shenanigans restaurant. Drew later reveals that there is only one position available, but Lewis and Oswald have already quit their jobs. Drew cannot decide whom to pick, so Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) suggests they go to Shenanigans to see who is better at the job. Both Lewis and Oswald are terrible, so Drew tells them they can work for him. Oswald realises that he went into the wrong office when he quit his job and returns to work. Lewis and Drew visit Lewis' boss (Jay Leno) at DrugCo to ask him to give Lewis his job back. Production Wayne Brady appears with other Whose Line Is It Anyway? cast members in the improvisational segments. Following the first live episode of The Drew Carey Show in 1999, which achieved high ratings, a second live episode was conceived in a bid to repeat that success and capitalise on the November sweeps ratings period. The producers also wanted to \\"push the envelope even further\\" than before, so they decided to keep many elements of the episode a secret from the cast. Improvisational segments were added to the basic plot, allowing the producers to throw the cast \\"a few curve balls\\". Executive producer Bruce Helford stated, \\"The actors don't know what's coming at them. They don't know what's behind every door.\\" Helford planned to bring in guest stars during the recordings, as well having the studio audiences come up with suggestions on how the episode should end, leaving the cast with little time to prepare before they act it out. Neil Conrad, the channel's Broadcast and Standard Practices editor, admitted that he was scared about the episode, especially after the first live broadcast, in which a guest cast member was caught with a handwritten message to his mother on his buttocks. Helford joked that Conrad had a right to be worried, but he also said that if the cast were to mess up, then it just adds to the fun. As with the first live episode, the cast and crew performed \\"Drew Live II\\" three times for the Eastern/Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones. Several cast members from the improvisational comedy series Whose Line Is It Anyway? made guest appearances in the episode. Colin Mochrie once again reprised his role as Eugene, while Wayne Brady, Brad Sherwood, Chip Esten, Greg Proops, Kathy Greenwood and Laura Hall appeared in the various improv segments. Talk show host Jay Leno also makes a cameo appearance. To coincide with the episode, ABC planned to air live promos featuring actors coming by The Drew Carey Show studio to promote their ABC shows. To prove to the viewers that the episode was live, some of the actors were seen watching and improvising the dialogue for that nights broadcast of Felicity, which aired in the same time slot on The WB. Helford had originally chosen an episode of The West Wing, but the show's producers rejected the idea and Felicity was chosen instead, as long as the actors did not make any jokes about Keri Russell's hairstyle. Felicity creator J.J. Abrams praised the segment, saying \\"The idea of characters on a live show tuning in to another network to see what's on was brilliant. My only hope is that it reminded people: 'What the hell am I doing not watching The WB?'\\" Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Drew Live II\\" was watched by 15.2 million viewers, finishing in 22nd place in the ratings for the week of November 6‚Äì12, 2000. It was the sixth highest-rated show on ABC that week, following episodes of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, NFL Monday Night Football, The Practice, NFL Monday Showcase, and ABC's coverage of the presidential election. A writer for Warner Bros. stated that the episode showed The Drew Carey Show was \\"one of the most consistently unique comedies on television\\", and that the show would \\"go where no other comedy has gone and put new twists on the series' second annual live episode\\". Joel Brown of The Spokesman-Review chose the episode as one of his television \\"Highlights\\" for November 8, 2000. Of the cast, he commented, \\"expect them all to crack themselves up, as usual\\". A critic for The Orlando Sentinel included the episode in the newspaper's \\"Prime Picks\\" feature, and commented that it was \\"a dangerously unpredictable episode.\\" Sandra P. Angulo from Entertainment Weekly included \\"Drew Live II\\" in her feature on \\"the splashier sweeps events\\" for the week, commenting \\"In what's becoming an annual event, Drew and company ‚Äì including the improv aces from Whose Line Is It Anyway? ‚Äì perform live for each of the three time zones. Basically, they have three chances to get it right.\\" James Joyce, writing for the Newcastle Herald, noted that Carey had \\"always been willing to toy with the conventions of the sitcom format\\", and dubbed Oswald and Lewis his \\"dimwit buddies\\". The Washington Post's Lisa de Moraes was not a fan of the live format, stating \\"Apparently no one at ABC watched last season's live, partially improvised Drew Carey train wreck, so they're allowing the producers to do it again.\\" Allan Johnson for Chicago Tribune gave the episode a mention in his round up of the special episodes airing during November sweeps. Production mixer Klaus Landsberg earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Multi-Camera Sound Mixing for a Series or a Special for his work on the episode.

She earned her PhD at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in 1912, under the supervision of August Gutzmer. Early life Nugel was the fourth of six children of a musician, Friedrich Arthur Nugel. She was born on 18 June 1884 in Cottbus. She studied at the M√§dchen-Mittelschule (Girl's Middle School) there until 1901, then began studies at the H√∂here M√§dchenschule (Girl's High School) until 1906. Shortly after, she completed the state teaching examination in Berlin. Returning to Cottbus, she worked as a private tutor for the Von Werdeck family, before taking the final level of German mathematics exams under the tutelage of Rudolf Tiemann. Career In 1906 Nugel became certified as a teacher, and began working as a private instructor for the Werdeck family near Cottbus. After finishing her studies at the Luisenst√§dtische Oberschule (High School) in 1907, she started university studies in Berlin. She moved to Munich in 1909, and moved again to Halle in the same year. She took a position as a teacher at a girls' school in Cottbus, but taught there only for two years, until her marriage to Louis Hahn in 1914. The first of their four children was born in 1915. She moved with her husband to Altena and then Emden, her husband's home town, where he worked at his family's newspaper business. She taught intermittently at two schools there from 1914 to 1918, during World War I, but from then until 1927 she taught only privately, also publishing works promoting civil rights and better education for women. In 1927, after the collapse of her husband's newspaper business, Nugel obtained a part-time position at a school in Emden. By 1930 her position there had become permanent, albeit at a smaller salary than the men in her school. The subjects she taught during this time included mathematics, physics, and German. Between 1939 and 1945 she witnessed the bombing of the city of Emden, as part of WWII, and the school was forced to move to Bad Wildungen; her two sons served as officers in the war, and were both killed in 1944. Nugel retired in 1945 at the age of 61. Her husband died of an illness in 1952. In 1955, she moved to Bad Godesberg in order to connect with her remaining family. In 1962, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Halle gave her a \\"Golden Doctoral Diploma\\" award, on the 50th anniversary of her 1912 dissertation.

(Golden Grove is no longer listed in Lloyd's Register in 1796.) Golden Grove was one of seven vessels wrecked in the same storm. At the time, Golden Grove and at least five of the other vessels that were wrecked were part of Admiral Christian's fleet that was sailing to capture islands in the West Indies. The British fleet did not leave Spithead until 16 November; two days after departing, a westerly gale blew up, dispersing the fleet and driving the ships back to port. Several of the merchantmen, Golden Grove among them, were wrecked with heavy loss of life; over 200 bodies were washed up on the coastline between Portland and Bridport. The expeditionary force finally sailed between mid-February and mid-March. In May‚ÄìJune the British succeeded in capturing St Lucia, Saint Vincent, and Grenada.

She was the editor of The Humanist magazine for several years and taught at both Indiana University and Harvard University. Family and education She was born Priscilla Smith in Paris, France, but grew up in New England. Her father, Preserved Smith, was a historian. Her mother died when she was just three years old. She graduated from Vassar College in 1930 with a degree in history. She married Cary Robertson, who was Sunday editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal. They had three children and lived on a farm in Kentucky. Career After college, she moved to Louisville, Kentucky, to work as a schoolteacher. She also worked as an organizer with the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. Following her marriage, she became the literary editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal. In the early 1950s, she published her first two books. Lewis Farm: A New England Saga (1950) traced the changing patterns of life for the women of earlier generations of her own family and was privately printed. Revolutions of 1848: A Social History (1952) was the first major English-language survey of the revolutions of 1848. The New York Times praised it as in the best tradition of humanism. In the mid 1950s, she went to work as an associate editor at The Humanist magazine, and moved up to editor in 1956. During her tenure as editor, she published work by the geneticist H. J. Muller, the psychologist Abraham Maslow, and the science fiction writers Miriam Allen deFord and Isaac Asimov. She also wrote for the magazine herself, contributing reviews and articles on diverse topics. She lost her job in 1959 over an editorial disagreement with the board of directors of the American Humanist Association, the magazine's publisher. The magazine's staff resigned en masse in a show of support for Robertson. Robertson then moved on to teach at Indiana University (1962‚Äì68) and Harvard University (1966), as well as several smaller schools. In 1982, she published her third book, An Experience of Women: Pattern and Change in 19th-Century Europe, a comparative study of the situations of women in England, France, Italy, and Germany. She also helped found the Kentucky Humanities Council and the Kentucky League of Women Voters, and she chaired the board of the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union. In 1956, she received the National Institute of Arts and Letters Award. Priscilla Robertson died of a stroke in Louisville, Kentucky. Her papers are held by Vassar College.

The island is very easy to get to from the Westbrook public beaches, as it is only 500 feet away from land. Because the island was so close to land, people would often haul carts and horses to the island on a shallow day to gather materials for themselves. \\"In the year of 1871, Theodore D. Post, together with his brother, Gilbert A. Post, and three neighbors, J.L. Stokes, George Kirtland and C.R. Stannard, organized and operated the Salt Island Oil Company to manufacture Manhaden Oil and Fish Guano. Theodore Post acted as President and Treasurer and he took care of all the bookkeeping and paper work. Almost all of the operation took place on Salt Island, a short distance from the shore off Middle Beach [in Westbrook, CT]. The company constructed several small buildings, a dock, heating facilities and a press to separate the oil from the fish. A great deal of fishing gear was assembled, including boats, nets, and sails and one large scow. The operation consisted of catching large quantities of fish in nets, heating them in large iron vats, and then pressing out the oil. The oil was put into wooden vats or barrels and shipped by boat, mostly to New York City. The residue of the fish, consisted of scraps, bones, skin, heads, etc. was sold as Fish Guano, or fertilizer. Many of the farmers in Westbrook used this product and the soil became very rich and produced excellent crops. Theodore's son, Edwin Albert Post, spent much of his boyhood working and playing around Salt Island during the fifteen years the company was in operation. His mother died when he was ten years old, so it became his job to take care of the home and his little sister, do the cooking and the farm chores while his father was busy catching fish and manufacturing the oil and guano. They worked out a system of signals so that if something was needed on the Island or at home, a message could be sent from a window in the house which could be seen on Salt Island. There were no telephones in Town at that time. If needed, father could drive a horse or a yoke of oxen with a load of wood to the island at low tide, or any other materials which might be needed. Often, he would bring a load of seaweed home to bank around the foundation of the house to keep it warm during winter months or put the seaweed into the cow yard to keep the animals clean and to add to the fertilizer needed for planting in the spring. The Company prospered until 1886. About that time, well-to-do families from the large cities began to build summer homes on the beautiful shores of Westbrook and they objected to the odor from the oil and guano factory. The summer residents finally succeeded in having the operation closed by law.\\" Taken from a personal history written by, Edwin Ernest Post [1899-1987], grandson of Theodore Dwight Post. Salt Island is also home to a number of kinds of animals, being watched over by the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. Some parts of the island are not accessible due to wild seabird habitats. The indigenous animals that can be found on Salt Island include channeled whelks, Atlantic horseshoe crabs, common periwinkle, North American spider crabs, giant hermit crabs, terns, and oystercatchers. The island is also known for its strange rock formations. The rocks are carved from constant wave splashing and the changing of the tides. The rocks are short and almost resemble waves of the ocean. They can be touched but if not careful, you will cut yourself due to the intricate edges on the rocks from hundreds of years of formation.

Its history dates back to 1944 and it is one of the few remaining resorts in the area. The Resort is located near the Monticello Raceway and runs bus trips to and from the track on a regular basis during their busy season. The resort offers family activities, nightlife, 5 swimming pools, go-karts, multiple sports facilities, formal and casual dining as well as a Championship Golf Course. History The resort was established in 1944 by Ernesto Vindigni. At the time it had fewer than fifty hotel rooms and ten cottages. Owing to its Italian ownership, the resort's pool was accompanied by two bocce courts. Its first major expansion came in the 1970s after Martin Passante was bow hunting nearby and spotted the for sale sign on the property. They purchased the property in December 1969 and by 1973 began construction on the Club Forum and Futura Wing, which allowed the hotel to remain open year round once they opened in 1978. An Indoor sports complex followed in 1982 and a ski area in 1983. As of 2017, Villa Roma hosts more than 200,000 guests per year in 24 timeshare buildings, and 139 hotel rooms.  Culture  The Villa Roma resort was designed as an Italian Resort and features a Tuscan atmosphere. Much of the cuisine in the main dining room is focused around fine Italian dining. Though located right within the, once popular, borscht belt; many of those who vacation at the resort are of Italian descent and the resort is not kosher. A large number of those guests are from the New York City area. This differs from the traditional resorts in the area, which were opened and operated by Jewish families to serve predominantly other Jewish families. Villa Roma, today, is a popular vacation spot of many families of Jewish descent. Around the time of the Jewish holiday, Passover, the resort changes their menu and serves guests meals designated for the holiday to those who gather for it. The resort is said to mix tradition with modern amenities.  Golf course  The Villa Roma golf course is one of the newest in the Catskills. Opened in 1986, the 18-hole Course is designed as a Par 71, 6.499 yard course for experts and 6,200 - 6,350 yards for beginners, young golfers and women.  2006 fire  In April 2006, the Villa Roma resort suffered a fire in its main building. While the Timeshares and the Golf Course were not affected, most of the remaining resort had to be shut down temporarily until they could assess what was usable.

It was erected in 1908 by a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. History Unveiling in City Park, 1908 The memorial was installed by the Robert E. Lee Chapter #186 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and unveiled on his birthday in January 1908. It had taken the Daughters nine years to collect the necessary $7,500. The statue sits atop a granite pedestal. The memorial is dedicated \\"To all heroes of the South who fought for the Principles of States Rights\\". Illustration of the monument The monument was put up at a time when Houston was a re-segregated city; the city had enacted separate streetcar compartments for whites and blacks in 1903, and \\"the following year, thousands of black voters were removed from the electorate when the city adopted a $2.50 poll tax\\". At the unveiling, Joseph Chappell Hutcheson, a Confederate veteran and Democratic representative in the Texas House of Representatives and the United States House of Representatives, said, \\"Look upon this masterpiece wrought in bronze, this marvel of art to typify the spirit and genius of that Confederacy we once so fondly loved and still so fondly cherish\\". A 1911 history of the city said it has \\"done much to preserve the memory of the Confederate soldiers who have passed over the river and to care for and comfort those who are still on this side\\". =Pressures for removal= Doubts about the monument were expressed in 2015 after the racially motivated Charleston church shooting, with one citizen asking, \\"Is it something that we want to take pride in anymore when so many people are offended by it?\\" Protesters said the statue celebrated slavery and racism, while others argued that removing the monument meant removing history. The controversy was reignited in 2017 after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. The monument is one of two monuments in Houston dedicated to the Confederacy; the other is the statue of Richard W. Dowling.

It has elliptical to egg-shaped leaves that are often greyish green, white flowers about in diameter arranged in consecutive leaf axils and fruit that remain on the plant for some time after maturity. Description Leptospermum glaucescens is a shrub or small tree that has flaky bark and young stems that are hairy when young. It has elliptical to egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, mostly about long, wide and often greyish green, tapering to a petiole about long. The flowers are arranged singly in consecutive leaf axils on a stout pedicel and are about in diameter. There are broad, brownish bracts at the base of the flower bud but that fall off as the flower develops. The floral cup is long and usually densely hairy. The sepals are broadly egg-shaped to triangular, long, the petals white, long and the stamens about long. Flowering occurs from January to February and the fruit is a capsule wide, remains on the plant for some time after maturity and has the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum glaucescens was first formally described in 1841 by Sebastian Schauer in the journal Linnaea: ein Journal f√ºr die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beitr√§ge zur Pflanzenkunde. Schauer's description was based on specimens grown in the botanic garden in Breslau from seed donated by Berlin Botanic Garden, but extensive searches have failed to locate Schauer's type specimens. The neotype is \\"virgate shrubs to high dominating damp sandy heathland\\" at the western foot of the Strzelecki Peaks on the south-west of Flinders Island in Tasmania. In 1806, Jacques Labillardi√®re described Leptospermum sericeum in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen from specimens collected \\"in capite Van-Diemen\\" and this name was applied to plants collected in Tasmania. However, Labillardi√®re had confused \\"Van-Diemen\\" with \\"Terre Van-Leuwin\\", and although he later made the correction on the herbarium sheet in Paris, the name L. sericeum continued to be applied to plants collected in Tasmania. Although in 1844 Johannes Conrad Schauer noted in Plantae Preissianae (in Latin) \\"in Van Leuwin's Land, not on Van Diemen's Island\\", the correction was not made until 1967 with the publication of James Hamlyn Willis's paper in the journal Muelleria. Leptospermum sericeum is a Western Australian endemic, found near Esperance, which has pink, sessile flowers and does not grow to the height of L. glaucescens. Distribution and habitat The blue-green tea tree grows in wet heath and is widespread in Tasmania.

From 1978 to 1983, Lusk did a weekly radio commentary on books that was syndicated on National Public Radio. In the same era, he led student- teacher workshops for the National Endowment for the Arts' Poets-in-the- Schools Program. After earning a Master's Degree at the University of South Dakota, Lusk was an administrator and lecturer in English at the University of Vermont.

The poetry collection Lake Studies: Meditations on Lake Champlain (2011) and its companion audiobook The Inland Sea: Reflections (2013) were inspired by more than two years of research into Lake Champlain's history, interviews with divers, and Lusk's experiences on the lake, especially the area called the Inland Sea, which is an old name for the broad lake east of the Champlain Islands of South Hero/Grand Isle, North Hero and Isle LaMotte. Lake Studies and The Inland Sea were publishing collaborations with the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. The poems in Lusk's collection Kin (Wind Ridge, 2013) were largely inspired by the wildlife he encountered while living in rural northern Vermont. The collection was a finalist for the Tupelo Press Dorset and Snowbound Awards, the Sarabande Press Morton Prize, and White Pine Press Book Award. Many of the individual poems in this collection were first published in national journals, among them Appalachia, The Iowa Review, New Letters, Nimrod International Journal, North American Review, and The Southern Review. The British writer J. B. Pick (John Pick) wrote of Kin, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the ability to focus imagery, unite disparates, use language with grace and power‚Ä¶the astonishments which occur every page show clearly that Lusk is a poet of rare talent.‚Äù Lusk's next collection, The Vermeer Suite (Wind Ridge, 2015), includes poems inspired by the paintings of the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The book includes full-color images of some of Vermeer's works. Lusk's 2017 collection, The Shower Scene from Hamlet (Phoenix Books), invites readers, \\"to reexamine characters from literature or history and to contemplate their unknowns, to consider the moments that might not have made it into Hamlet or other volumes.\\" Lusk is the editor of Onion River: Six Vermont Poets (1996) and the author of a poetry primer Homemade Poems (1974). Other works include a memoir, Girls I Never Married, (2014) and a novel, O, Rosie (1979). In 2006 Lusk won the Nimrod International Journal of Prose and Poetry's Pablo Neruda Prize for Poetry. Lusk was a semi-finalist for the same prize in 2017 for his poem \\"Robyn of the Snows.\\" In 2015 Lusk was awarded a Pushcart Prize for his essay \\"Bomb,\\" which appeared in the Spring/Summer 2014 issue of the literary journal New Letters and was republished in Pushcart Prize XL, edited by Bill Henderson (2016).

It premiered at the 74th Venice International Film Festival. It was also screened in the Masters section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. On 29 September 2017, the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences chose the film as the national entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards and Best Iberoamerican Film at the 32nd Goya Awards. Plot In the late 18th century Don Diego de Zama is a functionary in a remote outpost in Argentina. His wife and children are far away from him and he longs to be assigned to a post in Lerma, a change he believes is imminent. The town is plagued by rumours of the feats of Vicu√±a Porto, a man who robs and rapes at will and who others are always claiming to have met and defeated. Uninterested by the gossip, Zama spends his time trying to seduce the wealthy, married, Spanish noblewoman Luciana Pi√±ares de Luenga who rebuffs him. He learns that the governor, who had been promising to recommend his transfer, is being transferred himself by order of the King of Spain. Brokenhearted that he has not been transferred, Zama runs afoul of the new Governor when the Governor learns that one of the employees is writing a book while at work. The Governor orders Zama to read the book and issue a full report. Reluctantly Zama agrees. After he writes a damning report the Governor agrees to write a first letter of recommendation, revealing that the king always ignores first requests and a second one will take several more years to make its way to the king. Defeated, Zama agrees to join a party of men looking to hunt down and kill Vicu√±a Porto. In the middle of the night Zama wakes to find the horses being stolen and has a conversation with one of the men in his group, who claims he is Vicu√±a Porto. Later, the men are captured by an indigenous tribe, who ultimately let them go. The survivors are completely bedraggled and the captain tells Zama they cannot return without Vicu√±a Porto, prompting Zama to reveal Vicu√±a Porto's identity. Porto and his men tie up Zama and the Captain, the only two remaining members of the expedition who are not faithful to Porto. The men kill the captain and let Zama live as they believe he has information about hidden jewels that will make them rich. When Zama tells them no such riches exist they cut off his hands. Zama manages to survive but his future is uncertain as he awakes with no hands on a raft, having been rescued by an indigenous man and child. Cast * Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho as Don Diego de Zama * Lola Due√±as as Luciana Pi√±ares de Luenga * Matheus Nachtergaele as Vicu√±a Porto * Juan Minuj√≠n as Ventura Prieto Production The film had a slow production process with director Lucrecia Martel first announcing her attachment to the film in 2012. The film was rumoured to begin filming by 2014, but a still was released in May 2015 shortly after filming actually began. The film then spent two years in post-production after Martel learned she had cancer and she struggled to maintain her health and complete the film. Reception Zama received widespread acclaim from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Zama offers a series of scathingly insightful observations about colonialism and class dynamics ‚Äî and satisfyingly ends a long wait between projects from writer-director Lucrecia Martel.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Following its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, The A.V. Clubs A.A. Dowd gave the film a B+ grade and wrote: \\"Zama, despite its setting, isn‚Äôt such a radical departure for Martel; it preserves her talent for tracking an individual through chaotic social spheres\\". Upon its theatrical release, Zama received universal acclaim from the Argentine press. On the Argentine website Todas Las Cr√≠ticas, which collects local reviews, the film has an average rating of 82 out of 100 and an approval rating of 88%, based on 41 reviews. Luciano Monteagudo of P√°gina/12 praised Martel's direction and considered Zama to be \\"a new peak in her work, a film with a visual and sound complexity that is out of the norm in contemporary cinema, capable of breaking with narrative linearity to go in search of a colonial past that can only be imagined in a fragmentary way, as one who explores his identity in the remnants of what is called History.\\" An enthusiastic review came from Clar√≠ns Pablo O. Scholz, who called it \\"an invitation to the senses, a film that floods, overflows in more than one meaning\\" and a \\"captivating experience.\\" Writing for La Naci√≥n, Mar√≠a Fernanda Mugica stated that Zama was \\"work of art that requires an attentive, patient and open viewer\\", feeling that \\"it is admired since the first shot but it begins to be better appreciated later, when the fascination for the beauty of the images and the intensity of the sounds leave room in the viewer for a connection with the frustration experienced by its protagonist\\". Writing for Otros Cines, Diego Batlle gave the film the highest rating and compared it to the work of Terrence Malick, Werner Herzog, John Ford and Claire Denis, while stating: \\"but Martel's cinema is unique, non-transferable, inimitable, incomparable.\\" In 2019 TIFF Cinematheque named the film the best film of the decade as voted on by Canadian journalists, critics, and historians.
