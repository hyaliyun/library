He is the founder and director of the Liverpool Bach Collective. Biography For over thirty six years Philip Duffy was associated with the music of Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King; for most of them he was Master of the Music (1966–1996). He was born in Liverpool in 1943, and after an abortive start at the piano at the age of seven, he commenced serious study of the instrument when he was sixteen with Albert Griffiths. In 1960 he began organ lessons with Noel Rawsthorne. It was when he was a sixth- former at St Edward's College (now the Cathedral Choir School) that the Lutyens' Crypt of the Metropolitan Cathedral was completed and brought into use, and he joined the newly-formed Cathedral Choir. His interest in music continued to grow until he decided to make it his career. Philip went on to study at the Royal Manchester College of Music and the University of London. At Manchester he studied organ with Ronald Frost, and singing with Gwilym Jones. While he was in London he studied under Henry Washington, one of the country's leading choir directors, in the choir of Brompton Oratory and in the Schola Polyphonica. As a member of the Schola he took part in the first performances of early church music ever given at Henry Wood Promenade Concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, and as a member of Michael Morrow's pioneering early music group Music Reservata in one of its first recordings. At the age of 23, Philip was offered the post of Acting Choirmaster at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral – just eight months before the Cathedral was consecrated and opened. Shortly afterwards he was appointed Master of the Music, and worked in partnership with his brother Terence (who was Cathedral Organist until 1993, and Director of Music 2004–2007). Together with Terence, Philip was responsible particularly for training a choir worthy of both the Cathedral and its Liturgy. He has always remained conscious of the enormous privilege – and the exhilarating challenge and the heavy responsibility – of founding the music tradition of this stimulating new, modern, Cathedral at a time when the liturgy of the RC church was itself being completely revitalised and reformed as a result of the second Vatican Council. His particular interest has always been vocal training and choral work, and at his instigation the Metropolitan Cathedral was among the first in the country to offer its choristers individual vocal tuition. Many former choristers have since gone on to become professional singers; recently, for example, in two successive nights of opera at Glyndebourne (by Handel and by Britten) five ex-choristers performed either as principals or as members of the chorus. A special interest has been to compose church music involving both choir and congregation and Philip Duffy remains one of few composers working in this sphere. The liturgical celebrations which opened and closed the National Pastoral Congress of the RC Church in Liverpool in 1980 set new standards of celebration in the Catholic Church in Britain. \\"The settings … by Philip Duffy… taken up easily by the whole congregation… were of an almost barbaric but utterly disciplined beauty, unprecedented in any English Catholic Church in modern times…\\" [Fergus Kerr in Blackfriars magazine.] Philip had overall responsibility for the music of these events, and his work was recognised afterwards by Pope John Paul II, who appointed him a Knight of the Equestrian Order of St Gregory the Great. The success of his composing for choir and congregation was also recognised in 1982 during the same Pope's visit to Britain, when his music was chosen for the large-scale papal masses not only at Liverpool, but also at Wembley, Manchester, Cardiff and Crystal Palace. Of the Papal celebration in Liverpool, The Tablet reported \\"Liverpool's Glorias, Alleluias and Hosannas must have brought Heaven running to the windows.” Philip's music is currently sung in America, Australia, and (in appropriate translation) in Sweden, Switzerland, Italy and Africa. He has directed and lectured at many courses on music and liturgy both locally and nationally, and he continues to compose liturgical music. Philip founded the Metropolitan Cathedral Orchestra in 1982 and was its conductor for many years. Its distinctive contribution to Cathedral services on the major feast days, and especially the occasional performance of Bach Cantatas during Evening Prayer attracted much interest. He led the Cathedral Choir on tours of Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy and Hungary. Philip was a member of the Roman Catholic Bishops' National Committee on Church Music for many years. He has also been a member of the Councils of Universa Laus (an international society of liturgists and musicians) and the Royal School of Church Music. At the invitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury he was a member of the Archbishops' Commission on Church Music in the Anglican Church, 1988–1992. In 1994 the Archbishop of Canterbury presented him with an Honorary Fellowship of the Guild of Church Musicians, and in 2009 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal School of Church Music. Since leaving the Cathedral he has enjoyed singing and conducting engagements. Recent activities have included the role of tenor soloist in Mozart's Requiem in Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral and in Gibraltar Cathedral, and baritone soloist in Brahms' Requiem in Jemina de la Frontera (Southern Spain). He has often acted as chief cantor for the Schola Gregoriana of Cambridge, and he led this group on a ten-day recital tour of Venice. He is Associate Director of Music of the Schola and he continues to lead chant workshops in many parts of the country. He worked at Liverpool Hope University from 2000 to 2015, where besides lecturing in music, he led the degree programme BA in Creative and Performing Arts. He retired from a full-time post as Principal Lecturer in 2008, and became Director of Performance for the University, then for several years continued as Director of the University's Chamber Choir (which had a reputation for innovative programming and for high standards of performance of music of the baroque and classical periods). In 2014 he founded, and still directs, the Liverpool Bach Collective, an ensemble of eight singers and about ten instrumentalists, which performs Bach Cantatas regularly at Sunday Evensong in churches around Liverpool. In its first three years the Collective performed 29 cantatas in 19 different churches. In a different sphere, Philip was producer and presenter of a weekly classical music programme for Liverpool's independent local radio (Radio City) for the first nine years of its existence.

When news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord arrived in Norwich on April 20, 1775 Colonel Huntington immediately got his men ready to march. On April 26 they arrived in Wrentham, Massachusetts, and a few days later they were in Roxbury and became part of the Siege of Boston. Because of a lack of overall command, as well as a lack of supplies, many of the militia units returned home. In July 1775, the Connecticut Assembly ordered the creation of the 8th Connecticut Regiment and gave command to Colonel Huntington. The men were recruited mainly in New London, Hartford, and Windham Counties and included much of Huntington's 20th regiment. The regiment was stationed on the Long Island Sound until September 14 when, on requisition from Washington, it was ordered to the Boston Camps and again took its post at Roxbury in Gen. Spencer's Brigade. The 8th remained active until expiration of the terms of service in December 1775. As part of the January 1, 1776, organization of the Continental Army, Huntington's 8th Connecticut Regiment became the 17th Continental Regiment. Originally planned to have a strength of 728 officers and men, by the end of January the 17th only had about 400, as did most of the other regiments. On March 4, the 17th regiment was one of those ordered to take and hold Dorchester Heights, the action that ended the siege by forcing the British to evacuate Boston. The day following the end of the siege, Washington began moving the army to New York, and by April 22, Huntington and most of his unit were in position there. Huntington's regiment began fortifying New York City in anticipation of a British attack and it was here they heard of the Declaration of Independence. The 17th had lost men during the Boston siege due to illness and desertion, which continued in New York. On about August 19, Colonel Huntington became seriously ill, possibly with malaria, and was unable to perform his duties, so his second in command Lt. Col. Joel Clark replaced him. On August 24, the regiment was ordered to the Brooklyn front. Because it was so understrength it was placed under the command of Gen. Parsons and combined with Col. Atlee's Pennsylvania regiment. When the Battle of Long Island was fought on the 27th, most of Huntington's regiment was surrounded and taken as prisoners, including Lt. Col. Clark, who died in captivity. The few men left of Huntington's regiment joined the main army under the command of Gen. Heath and evacuated with them as they fled New York. The 17th was never rebuilt and it ceased to exist when enlistments expired at the end of December, although many of the men continued to serve. On Jan 1, 1777 the new 8th Regiment, \\"Connecticut Line\\" was formed for the new \\"Continental Line,\\" and it was placed under the command of Colonel John Chandler, and saw action in the Battle of Germantown, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, and the Battle of Monmouth. The regiment was merged into the 1st Connecticut Regiment on January 1, 1781, at West Point, New York and disbanded on November 15, 1783. Notable members Joseph Plumb Martin served in this regiment from 1777 until he was assigned to the Light Infantry in 1778, and then the Corps of Sappers and Miners in 1780.Martin, Joseph Plumb (attributed), A Narrative of Some of the Adventures, Dangers, and Sufferings of a Revolutionary Soldier, Interspersed with Anecdotes of Incidents that Occurred within His Own Observation, 1830. In notes to the edition of 1962 edited by George F. Scheer under the title \\"Private Yankee Doodle,\\" Scheer gives Martin's date of enlistment with this regiment as April 12, 1777. Martin had earlier served with Connecticut state troops in and around New York in 1776. He published his memoirs about his experiences in 1830. Samuel Mattocks commanded a company in the 8th Connecticut with the rank of Captain. After resigning his commission he moved to Tinmouth, Vermont. Mattocks was Vermont State Treasurer during Vermont's early years, and the father of Governor John Mattocks.Mildred E.

He is also chairman of the trustees of the think tank ResPublica. Milbank founded radical orthodoxy movement. His work crosses disciplinary boundaries, integrating subjects such as systematic theology, social theory, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy, political theory, and political theology. He first gained recognition after publishing Theology and Social Theory in 1990, which laid the theoretical foundations for the movement which later became known as radical orthodoxy. In recent years he has collaborated on three books with philosopher Slavoj Žižek and Creston Davis, entitled Theology and the Political: The New Debate (2005), The Monstrosity of Christ: Paradox or Dialectic (2009), and Paul's New Moment: Continental Philosophy and the Future of Christian Theology (2010).

Following his secondary education at Hymers College, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with third-class honours in modern history from The Queen's College, Oxford. He was awarded a postgraduate certificate in theology from Westcott House, Cambridge. During his time in Cambridge he studied under Rowan Williams. He then received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Birmingham. His dissertation on the work of Giambattista Vico, entitled The Priority of the Made: Giambattista Vico and the Analogy of Creation, was written under the supervision of Leon Pompa. The University of Cambridge awarded him a senior Doctor of Divinity degree in recognition of published work in 1998. He married Alison Milbank, also a lecturer at the University of Nottingham, in 1978. The couple have two children.  Thought  A key part of the controversy surrounding Milbank concerns his view of the relationship between theology and the social sciences. He argues that the social sciences are a product of the modern ethos of secularism, which stems from an ontology of violence. Theology, therefore, should not seek to make constructive use of secular social theory, for theology itself offers a peaceable, comprehensive vision of all reality, extending to the social and political without the need for a social theory based on some level of violence. (As Contemporary Authors summarises his thought, \\"the Christian mythos alone 'is able to rescue virtue from deconstruction into violent, agonistic difference.'\\") Milbank is sometimes described as a metaphysical theologian in that he is concerned with establishing a Christian trinitarian ontology. He relies heavily on aspects of the thought of Plato and Augustine, in particular the former's modification by the neoplatonist philosophers. Milbank, together with Graham Ward and Catherine Pickstock, has helped forge a new trajectory in constructive theology known as radical orthodoxy—a predominantly Anglo-Catholic approach which is highly critical of modernity.

They forbade the maltreatment of the indigenous people and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism. The laws were created following the conquest and Spanish colonization of the Americas in the West Indies, where the common law of Castile was not fully applicable. The scope of the laws was originally restricted to the island of Hispaniola but was later extended to Puerto Rico and Jamaica. These laws authorized and legalized the colonial practice of creating Encomiendas, where Indians were grouped together to work under a colonial head of the estate for a salary, and limited the size of these establishments to between 40 and 150 people.

It respected, in some ways, the traditional authorities, granting chiefs exemptions from ordinary jobs and granting them various Indians as servants.Hussey 1939 The limited fulfillment of the laws sometimes led to protests and claims. Sometimes they were seen as a legalization of the previously poorer situation, which created momentum for reform, later carried out through the Leyes Nuevas (\\"New Laws\\") in 1542, a new set of stricter regulations about life in the New World including the rights of indigenous peoples, as well as the Laws of the Indies, to encompass the Papal bull and all edicts.  Origins  Cardinal Archbishop Domingo de Mendoza of Seville heard reports of the abuse of the Americas' Indians and sent a group of Dominican missionaries to Hispaniola to stop the maltreatment. They could not legally stop it, but missionaries made complaints and stirred up a debate that the settlers feared would make them lose their property interests; Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached to the colonists that they were sinning and did not have the right to force the Indians to serve them, claiming they should only be converted to Christianity. The colonists disagreed and decided the best way to protect their interests was to come together as a group and choose a Franciscan Friar named Alonso de Espinal to present their case to King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his daughter Queen Joanna of Castile, the co-rulers of Spain, and refute Montesinos's accusations. The colonists' plan backfired, though, and Spain was outraged by the cases of maltreatment of the Indians. To solve the moral and legal question, the rulers commissioned a group of theologians and academics to come up with a solution. Dominican Friars, under the sponsorship of Diego de Deza, supported the scientific examination of Christopher Columbus's claims for exploring the West that Columbus presented to then Queen of Castile, Isabel I of Castile and her husband, King of Aragon Ferdinand II of Aragon. After 1508, the friars made the case to defend the aboriginal American Indians from becoming serfs or slaves of the new colonists. The friars and other Spanish academics pressured King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his daughter, now the ruling Queen of Castile, Joanna I of Castile, to pass a set of laws to protect the rights of the natives of the New World, which were to become the 1512 Laws of Burgos. In Burgos, on 27 December 1512, thirty-five laws were put into effect to secure the freedom of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and to enforce Indian Reductions rules governing conversions. Summary It declared that the Indians are free people; that they ought to be instructed in the Christian faith; that they might be ordered to work, but so that their working should not hinder their conversion, and should be such as they could endure; that they should have cottages and lands of their own, and time to work for themselves; that they should be hold communication with the Christians; and that they should receive wages, not paid in money, but in clothes and furniture for they cottages. In total there were 35 laws promulgated by the Burgos document in 1512, summarized as follows:Laws Of Burgos (1512–1513)Simpson 1950 1: The Indians are to be moved to encomiendas. For every fifty Indians, four lodges shall be built (thirty by fifteen feet). This land cannot be taken from them since they were taken from their original land. The Indians will do the planting of all of the food. During the proper seasons, the encomenderos (men looking over the Indians) will have the Indians plant corn and raise the hens. 2: The Indians will leave their land voluntarily to come to the encomiendas so that they shall not suffer from being removed by force. 3: The citizen to whom the Indians are given must erect a structure to be used as a church. In the church must be a picture of Our Lady and a bell with which to call the Indians to prayer time. The person who has them in the encomienda must go with them to church every night and make sure they cross themselves and sing several hymns. If an Indian does not come to the church, he is not allowed to rest the next day. 4: To make sure the Indians are learning Christianity properly, they shall be tested every two weeks and taught what they do not know by the Encomendero. He shall teach them the Ten Commandments, the Seven Deadly Sins, and the Articles of Faith. Any encomendero that does not do this properly will be fined six gold pesos. 5: A church will be built equidistant from all estates. On Sundays, Mass shall be observed and a feast will be eaten. If the encomendero does not bring his Indians, he will be charged ten gold pesos. 6: If The church is too far away, another will be built. 7: The priests who collect tithes from the estates must have priests continually in the churches of the estates. 8: There shall be churches built at the mines so that the Indians working the mines may hear mass on Sundays. 9: Whoever has fifty Indians must choose one boy who the encomendero thinks is able, to be taught to read and write, and also the importance of Catholicism. This boy will then teach the other Indians because the Indians would more readily accept what the boy says than what the Spaniards says. If the encomendero has one hundred Indians, two boys shall be chosen. The faith must be ingrained into their heads so the souls of the Indians are saved. 10: If an Indian falls sick near where there is a priest, the priest must go to him and recite the Credo and other profitable things of the Catholic faith. The Indian shall make confession without being charged a fee. If the Indian is to die, he shall be buried with a cross near the church. If he is not buried, the encomendero owes a fine of four gold pesos. 11: The Indians must not be used as carriers for transporting things to the Indians at the mines. 12: All Spanish inhabitants who have Indians in an encomienda must have the infants baptized within a week of their birth. 13: After the Indians have been brought to the estates, gold shall be searched for as follows: Indians in an encomienda must search for gold for five months a year and at the end of the five months are allowed to rest for forty days. During the forty days, the Indians are not to be employed, unless they are a slave and accept to plant the crops. During the forty days, the Indians will be further instructed in faith since they have more time to learn. 14: The Indians must be allowed to perform their sacred dances. 15: All citizens who have Indians are required to feed them breads, yams, peppers, and on Sundays feed them dishes of cooked meat. For every offense, a fine of two gold pesos shall be paid. 16: According to Catholicism, the Indians are not allowed to have more than one wife at a time and they are not allowed to abandon their wives. 17: Sons of the chiefs of the Islands who are under the age of thirteen are to be given to the Friars so they can be taught how to read, write, and other things about Catholicism. When the sons reach the age of nineteen, they are to return to the encomienda and teach the others. 18: Pregnant women are not to be sent to the mines or made to plant the crops. They shall be kept on the estate and made to do household duties such as cooking and weeding. After the child is born, she can nurse it until it is three years old. After this time, she can return to the mines and other duties. 19: The Indians should not sleep on the ground. Each encomendero should provide his Indians with hammocks. 20: The Indians are to be given one gold peso every year to pay for clothing. 21: Indians may not change their masters. One encomendero cannot employ or house an Indian belonging to another encomendero. 22: The Indian chiefs are allowed two Indians to perform personal duties for every forty of their subjects. Also, visitors to the estates must treat the Indians well and teach them what they know of Catholicism. 23: Official inspectors must keep records of the activities and also the treatment of the Indians in the encomiendas. They must keep track of the population and how much gold is being mined. 24: The Indians are not to be physically or verbally abused for any reason. 25: The Indians are not to be used in private trade or for any other economic interest. 26: Encomenderos that have their Indians working in distant mines shall combine efforts with other estates to help provide food for the Indians. 27 Indians from other lands must also be taught the things of the Catholic faith. They are to be treated kindly, unless they are slaves. 28: If an encomendero dies, his successor takes control of the Indians. 29: Two inspectors should be appointed to each Estate. 30\\\\. The inspectors are to be chosen by the Admiral, judges, and officers. These people should be compensated by being given Indians in encomienda. 31\\\\. Villages should be inspected two times a year, once in the beginning of the year, and once in the summer. 32: If there is a runaway Indian, inspectors cannot apprehend them. They must be given to a man of good conscience who will find the Indians' encomendero. 33: All inspectors should hold a copy of the Laws of Burgos, signed by the Governor. 34: Inspectors must be provided residencias. 35: One person may not have more than one hundred and fifty Indians and no less than forty Indians in encomienda at one time. Amendments were added to the Laws or Burgos on 28 July 1513. 1: Indian women married to Indian men are not to be forced to serve with their husbands at the mines or anywhere else unless it is by their own free will or unless their husbands wish to take them. 2: Indian children do not have to do the work of adults until the reach the age of fourteen. They are then made to do the tasks of children, like weeding or working in their parents estates. 3: Unmarried Indian women who are under the authority of their parents have to work with them on their lands. Those not under the authority of their parents must be kept apart so they don’t become vagabonds. 4: After two years of service, the Indians are free to go. By this time they will be civilized and proper Christians, able to govern themselves. Results Bartolomé de Las Casas believed that the New World was granted to Spain and Portugal solely for the conversion of the Native residents. The Indians, he believed, should not be used for other purposes, especially not for profit. The only solution was to remove the presence of the Spanish colonists from the Indians, except for practicing missionaries. On 28 July 1513, four more laws were added in what is known today as Leyes Complementarias de Valladolid 1513, three related to Indian women and Indian children and another more related to Indian males. They were operational till 17 November 1526, when the so-called Ordenanzas de Granada 1526 came effective. These new amended laws reflected the theological and political disputes within the Spanish theologians and the intervention of the Roman Catholic Popes advisers included . They have been dealt with since the creation of the Council of the Indies, March 1523, by king Charles I of Spain, the son of Queen Joanna I of Castile, \\"The Mad\\", whose first president was Dominican Friar and Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church since 1530 under pope Clement VII Medici, (1478–1534), a former General of the Dominican Order, 1518–1524, Juan Garcia de Loaysa y Mendoza, (1478–1546), Archbishop of Sevilla, 1539 – 1546. The later \\"Ordenanzas de Granada,\\" 1526, were discussed mainly between king Charles I of Spain and \\"Licenciado\\" Rodrigo de Figueroa as a consequence of the extensive Institutional Battling promoted by famous Dominican Father Bartolomé de las Casas, an offspring of a merchant family from Seville, dealing in the past with black African slaves brought to the Caribbean islands, apparently, since no less than 1501, borrowing perhaps, in some cases, of the sociological views on \\"evangelization\\" of renowned Scottish Professor at University of Paris, c. 1510, John Mair, (1467–1550).

It was first called Webb's Additional Continental Regiment (after its colonel, Samuel Blachley Webb) before being added to the Connecticut Line in 1780. It saw action at Setauket in 1777, Rhode Island in 1778, and Springfield, New Jersey, in 1780, and was generally active in the defense of Connecticut, southern New York, and northern New Jersey. It was merged into the reorganized 2nd Connecticut Regiment in January 1781. Formation The regiment was raised on January 11, 1777, at Danbury, Connecticut, by Colonel Samuel Blachley Webb, a stepson of Connecticut politician Silas Deane. It was one of several so-called \\"additional regiments\\" authorized by the Second Continental Congress that were not associated with any particular state quotas. Names of Men Enlisted in the year 1777 from 1st June to 31st December, into a Regiment Commanded by Colonel Sam'l B. Webb, known by the name of one of the 11 additional Regiments, afterwards the 9th, and then the 3d Connecticut Regiment. In: Webb, J. Watson. Reminiscences of Generall Samuel B. Webb of the Revolutionary Army. New York: Globe Stationery and Printing Co., 1882, p. 386. History The regiment first saw action at the Battle of Setauket in August 1777 under Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons. It was then sent to the Hudson River Valley, where it served under General George Clinton in the aftermath of the October Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery. In December 1777 the regiment was involved in a failed expedition to Long Island (a more elaborate attempt on Setauket than that of the previous August) in which Colonel Webb was captured. The regiment spent the winter of 1777-78 at West Point, where it assisted in the construction of fortifications (including the Webb redoubt, probably named for the colonel). In 1778 the regiment was attached to the brigade of General James Varnum. As part of a combined Franco-American attempt to retake British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island, the brigade marched to Rhode Island, where it was involved in the August 29 Battle of Rhode Island. The battle was tactically indecisive, but the regiment was noted for its performance. The regiment wintered in Rhode Island. The regiment spent most of 1779 in Rhode Island, but was sent to winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey. In the spring of 1780, the remnants of Sherburne's Additional Continental Regiment were merged into the unit, and it was formally added to the Connecticut Line as the 9th Connecticut Regiment. That June, the regiment was involved in the Battle of Springfield, in which a British attempt to penetrated from New York City to the Continental Army camp at Morristown was repulsed. Its winter quarters for 1780-81 were in the Hudson valley.Johnston, Henry Phelps. Record of service of Connecticut men in the I. War of the Revolution, II. War of 1812, III.

I feel like a teenager who is 10 or 15 or 20 years old in a fairy tale, a fantasy, young and brilliant.\\" Death and legacy He died in Seoul, South Korea in August 2010 due to pneumonia and colorectal cancer, twelve days before his 75th birthday.

Licensed to the area of Dover-New Philadelphia, Ohio, it serves the Tuscarawas County area. It first began broadcasting in 1950, and had an FM sister station (101.7 WJER-FM) that operated from 1969 to 2006, which is today WHOF. The station was temporarily owned by Clear Channel Communications in a reverse LMA by owner Gary Petricola, who repurchased the AM station in 2007. In February 2016, WJER returned to the FM dial with a translator operating on 100.9 FM. FM Translator WJER programming is relayed to an FM translator; this gives the listener the ability to listen on FM in higher quality stereophonic sound. History =Origins of WJER= Jeremiah E. Reeves, of which WJER had been named for, was a member of one of the most influential families in Tuscarawas County, starting several major industries, banks and hotels in the Dover-New Philadelphia area. After his death in 1920, the Reeves family continued the leadership traditions begun by Jeremiah. Following World War II, the United States government saw the need to increase radio reach to citizens in rural as well as urban population centers, and many new AM stations were created. Jeremiah's daughter, Agnes (Reeves) Greer, filed for ownership of a new radio station for Dover, Ohio and was granted the license in 1949. As a tribute to her father, Ms. Greer requested the call letters for the station that were her father's initials, Jeremiah E. Reeves, or \\"JER\\". On Wednesday, February 22, 1950 at 6 a.m., WJER Radio began broadcasting operations in the present studio facility at 646 Boulevard, a parcel of land that was part of the Reeves family estate. The 175 foot \\"original\\" tower was erected on land with 5 miles of copper wire buried beneath its surface. WJER- FM was granted a license and began broadcasting in 1969 at 101.7. Originally, the FM station programmed \\"beautiful music\\" and was popular in doctor's offices and in elevators. As time went by WJER put more emphasis on the FM station, going \\"live\\" full-time by 1992. Both stations were locally-owned by Gary Petricola until 2003, when he sold them to Clear Channel Communications. Petricola, however, continued to operate both 101.7-FM and 1450-AM in a reverse LMA with Clear Channel. In 2006 Petricola's WJER Radio LLC later repurchased WJER-AM from Clear Channel for $200,000. =Relocation of the FM signal= On April 14, 2006, the Federal Communications Commission approved Clear Channel's request to move WJER-FM's community of license to North Canton, Ohio. The new location allowed the station to increase its power from 3,000 watts ERP to 6,000 watts ERP after the move. In a gradual process, the stations began simulcasting for most of the broadcast day, a process which completed in December 2006. WJER-FM signed off on December 27, and the license was transferred to North Canton, Ohio under the new callsign WHOF the next day. WJER-AM continued to broadcast the original Dover/New Philadelphia-based programming. Clear Channel signed on WHOF as Adult contemporary-formatted \\"my 101.7\\" serving the Akron/Canton area on January 16, 2007.

He left his estates to his illegitimate children, not his legitimate relatives, thus enriching families such as the Paulets (future Dukes of Bolton) and the Howes (future Earls Howe). By his servant and mistress Martha Jeanes, or Janes, or Jones, alias San(d)ford, he had one son John (who died childless) and three daughters, who all survived and left children: Elizabeth Scrope - married Thomas Savage (3rd Earl Rivers) Annabella Scrope ( - 30 March 1704) - married John Grubham Howe Mary Scrope ( - 1 November 1680) - married Charles Paulet (1st Duke of Bolton) The 11th baron's cousin Mary Eure did not claim the barony which passed eventually to her descendant Mrs Mary Johnson (1651-1731), de jure 16th Baroness Scrope of Bolton. The claim fell into abeyance from 1731 to 1814, and eventually passed to her grandson Charles Jones, de jure 17th Baron Scrope of Bolton (1774-1840) and then to his second but eldest surviving son Henry James Jones, de jure 18th Baron Scrope of Bolton (b. 1812). None of the Jones attempted to claim the dormant barony, possibly for financial reasons (it being costly to prove the extinction of all other co-heirs before the Committee for Privileges).

He is one of the Three Pure Ones () and is also known as the Jade Pure One (). He resides in the Heaven of Jade Purity. It is believed that he came into being at the beginning of the universe as a result of the merging of pure breaths. He then created Heaven and Earth. In Taoist mythology He once was the supreme administrator of Heaven, but later entrusted that task to his assistant Yuhuang, the Jade Emperor. Yuhuang took over the administrative duties of Yuanshi Tianzun and became the overseer of both Heaven and Earth. At the beginning of each age, Yuanshi Tianzun transports the Lingpao ching (or \\"Yuanshi Ching\\"), the Scriptures of the Magic Jewel, to his students (who are lesser deities), who in turn instruct mankind in the teachings of the Tao. Yuanshi Tianzun is said to be without beginning and the most supreme of all beings. He is in fact, a representation of the principle of all being. From him all things arose. He is eternal, limitless, and without form. Role in Fengshen Yanyi In the famous 16th-century \\"gods-and-demons\\" novel Investiture of the Gods, Yuanshi Tianzun is a superior man who has maintained his will for generations. He would be known as the master of the Kunlun Mountains, in which he had many disciples—one of such being Jiang Ziya. In time, Yuanshi Tianzun would tell Jiang that it would be time to head down to the world in order to attain a level of wealth and honor. Because Jiang Ziya was destined to assist in the creation of the new Zhou dynasty—as like Nezha—Yuanshi Tianzun would stay loyal to heaven's will and effectively send Jiang away to his new destiny. After telling Jiang what to do through a poetic format, Yuanshi Tianzun says his final words of farewell to his student. Worship Taoists claim that sacrifices offered to Yuanshi Tianzun by the king predate the Xia dynasty. The surviving archaeological record shows that by the Shang dynasty, the shoulder blades of sacrificed oxen were used to send questions or communication through fire and smoke to the divine realm, a practice known as scapulimancy. The heat would cause the bones to crack and royal diviners would interpret the marks as Yuanshi Tianzun's response to the king. Inscriptions used for divination were buried into special orderly pits while those that were for practice or records were buried in common middens after use.Xu Yahui. Caltonhill, Mark & al., trans. Ancient Chinese Writing: Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin. Academia Sinica. Nat'l Palace Museum (Taipei), 2002. Govt. Publ. No. 1009100250. Under Yuanshi Tianzun or his later names, the deity received sacrifices from the ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty annually at a great Temple of Heaven in the imperial capital. Following the principles of Chinese geomancy, this would always be located in the southern quarter of the city.For instance, the Classic of History records the Duke of Zhou building an altar in the southern part of Luo. During the ritual, a completely healthy bull would be slaughtered and presented as an animal sacrifice to Yuanshi Tianzun.Although the Duke of Zhou is presented as sacrificing two. The Book of Rites states the sacrifice should occur on the \\"longest day\\" on a round-mound altar. The altar would have three tiers: the highest for Yuanshi Tianzun and the Son of Heaven; the second- highest for the sun and moon; and the lowest for the natural gods such as the stars, clouds, rain, wind, and thunder. The ten stages of the ritual were:Lam, Joseph S.C. 1998. State Sacrifices and Music in Ming China: Orthodoxy, Creativity, and Expressiveness. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press. # Welcoming deities # Offering of jade and silk # Offering of sacrificial food # First offering of wine # Second offering of wine # Last offering of wine # Retreat of civil dancers and entry of military dancers # Performance of the military dance # Farewell to deities # Burning of sacrificial articles It is important to note that Yuanshi Tianzun is never represented with either images or idols. Instead, in the center building of the Temple of Heaven, in a structure called the \\"Imperial Vault of Heaven\\", a \\"spirit tablet\\" (神位, or shénwèi) inscribed with the name of Yuanshi Tianzun is stored on the throne, Huangtian Shangdi (皇天上帝). During an annual sacrifice, the emperor would carry these tablets to the north part of the Temple of Heaven, a place called the \\"Prayer Hall For Good Harvests\\", and place them on that throne.

The game was the first to be accompanied by a fully synchronised soundtrack which featured narration, celebrity artists and music. The cast included Ian Dury, Jon Pertwee, Donna Bailey, Frankie Howerd, E.P. Thompson, and Croucher (who also composed the music). Andrew Stagg coded the original Spectrum version, and Colin Jones (later known as author/publisher Colin Bradshaw-Jones) was the programmer of the Commodore 64 version. The game charts the life of a \\"defect\\" which has formed in \\"the machine\\", from conception, through growth, evolution and eventually death. The progression is loosely based on \\"The Seven Ages of Man\\" from the Shakespeare play, As You Like Ithttp://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/deus_ex_machina and includes many quotations and parodies of this. A remastered version of the game titled Deus Ex Machina, Game of the Year, 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition was released in 2015 for the Android, iOS, Ouya, Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. A second remastered version, Deus Ex Machina - The Final Cut, was released in 2016 for the Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Gameplay Players of the game are to take control of a defective machine which has taken the form of the human body. The players would experience the different stages of life, all the way from being a cell to being a senile old being. It is considered to be a visual-audio entertainment although the game itself does not have sound. It is separated into an audio cassette where the tape needs to be played alongside the game.http://www.sf- encyclopedia.com/entry/deus_ex_machina The length of the audio cassette is 46 minutes which is also the length of the game itself. Although the game could be played without the audio cassette, it would make it easier to understand with the help of the soundtrack. The soundtrack includes songs, musical compositions, and also voices of famous actors. As the game comes with a full transcript of the speech, it could at times be played without audio. Reception Despite critical acclaim at the time, the game did not conform to conventions of packaging and pricing required by distributors and retailers and the game was sold mail-order only direct to the public. It subsequently gained cult status as an underground art game.Houghton, David. The Top 7... Maddest British old-school games - 1. Deus Ex Machina (1985). GamesRadar. 19 October 2009. Legacy Croucher retrospectively viewed the game as a disappointment, saying \\"I should have sold the game at a sensible price. But I wanted to put a lovely poster in it and nice packaging and a double vinyl gatefold\\" and that as a result the price of £15 compared to the more usual £8 meant that sales were low, and the game only broke even. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. A re-imagining of the game went into production in 2010, under the title Deus Ex Machina 2, once again under the design and creation of Croucher. The new cast is led by Sir Christopher Lee as The Programmer, with Chyna Whyne as The Machine, Chris Madin as The Defect, Joaquim de Almeida as the Defect Police, and original Ian Dury session vocals. It marked the final performance of Christopher Lee that was released in his lifetime, being released 4 months prior to his death. In 2014 Croucher released a book about the game's (and his) history, and the making of the new game. The book is entitled Deus Ex Machina - The Best Game You Never Played in Your Life.

Michel Sarrazin, (5 September 1659 – 8 September 1734), was an early Canadian surgeon, physician, scientist and naturalist. Born in Nuits-sous-Beaune in the province of Burgundy, he immigrated at age 25 to the colony of New France as a surgeon. He remained in the colony for the rest of his life, returning to France only during two brief periods. While in New France, his medical skills were constantly in demand, and he quickly rose in the ranks, becoming one of the colonial elite. He was both a seigneur and a member of the Conseil Superieur, and held considerable influence in the colony. He had a great interest in botany, and kept up a frequent correspondence with the Académie Royale des Sciences in France, sending fellow scientists numerous specimens of North American plants, as well as detailed descriptions of dissections of animals. Sarrazin developed a vast knowledge of both the cultural and natural world of New France, and is credited being one of the first scientists to systematically catalogue ecosystems and samples found in New France, resulting in many important botanical discoveries. Despite his high ranking position as one of the few colonial intellectuals, Sarrazin faced chronic financial struggles, and died in poverty at age seventy-five, leaving a widow and four children. '' Early life Little is known of Michel Sarrazin’s early life. His mother was Madeleine de Bonnefoy, and his father was Claude Sarrazin, an official at the Abbey of Cîteaux. He had two brothers, one who became a priest, and another, Claude, who was an attorney. Both of Sarrazin’s brothers remained in their hometown of Nuits-sous-Beaune, and died in 1731.  Arrival in Colony and Return to France (1685–1697)  Sarrazin received some medical training in France before he was appointed as surgeon to the King’s troops in the colony of New France in 1685. This position required him to minister to both soldiers and town inhabitants. He was quickly noticed for his medical skill, and within a year was promoted to Surgeon Major, becoming the first person to hold this position in the colony. As Surgeon Major, Sarrazin travelled extensively with troops on expeditions to provide them with medical care. When he wasn’t with the troops, Sarrazin was kept busy travelling between the Hotels-dieu of Québec and Montreal, essentially treating the \\"civilian population of the entire colony\\". He was not paid for his work directly by his patients, but instead received a yearly sum from the King of France, Louis XIV, of around 300 livres. This sum gradually increased over time, but only through much lobbying on the part of Sarrazin and other colonial officials. Through his work, Sarrazin was constantly exposed to sickness and disease. In 1692 he fell seriously ill, spending about a month in hospital recovering. Around this time, he expressed some desire to join the church, and in 1693, temporarily withdrew from society. By 1694, however, he decided to return to France to continue his studies in medicine. He was encouraged to return quickly by colonial authorities including Indendant Bochart de Champigny, who recognized the value and necessity of having a skilled doctor in the colony. Back in France, Sarrazin spent three years studying in both Paris and Reims, where he received his doctorate of medicine. During his time in Paris, he spent time at the Jardin des Plantes, where he met and studied under Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, who introduced him to botany and \\"stimulated a lifelong interest in collecting and classifying\\". Sarrazin would later become a \\"correspondant\\" to Tournefort, and their relationship provided Sarrazin with an important link to the Académie Royale des Sciences. Sarrazin returned to New France in 1697 with a renewed interest in both medicine and natural sciences. As if to show how much his expertise was valued in the colony, he was put to work before he even set foot on shore. While on the voyage, the ship experienced an outbreak of \\"purple fever\\", or purpura, and Sarrazin, though also sick, devoted himself to caring for the passengers.  Life in New France (1697–1734)  = Career = Back in the colony, Sarrazin resumed his medical practice, armed with the knowledge and credentials he had gained while in France. His skills were valued in the colony, and as the leading medical professional, he was held in high esteem. In 1699, he was named head doctor of New France. The main goal of Sarrazin’s practice was to help the sick restore their health while gaining an understanding of the social and scientific causes of disease. His role was to treat the sick in hospitals in New France and prescribe remedies, but was not limited to that. Sarrazin also took on the function of apothecary, and became a trusted reference often called upon for medical advice. The lack of registered doctors at the time gave a lot of power to Sarrazin, placing him in a position of high authority. Sarrazin was responsible for identifying the competence of practitioners and had to approve the choice of surgeons for l’Hotel-Dieu of Quebec. In addition, Sarrazin was also called upon to perform autopsies, give advice in judicial matters, and provide affidavits of miraculous cures at the shrine of Sainte-Anne de Beaupré. Apart from briefly returning to France in 1709–1710, Sarrazin remained in the colony practicing medicine until his death at age 75. = Family Life = After having completed his studies in France and returned to New France, no family member was awaiting Sarrazin’s arrival in the colony. It was not until June 20, 1712, fifteen years after his return and at the age of fifty, that Sarrazin married Marie-Anne Hazeur, a former pupil of the Ursulines, in Montreal, Quebec. Madame Sarrazin’s father, Francois Hazeur, was a prominent businessman and seigneur, and consequently Sarrazin received the seigneuries of Grande-Vallée and of Anse-de l’Étang. Marie-Anne gave birth to seven children, three of which died in infancy. Upon Sarrazin’s death, Marie-Anne was left destitute, having to rely on her husband’s pension, and later returned to live with her brother, Canon Hazeur. = Work with the Académie Royale des Sciences = Sarrazin is credited with the discovery of sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), a member of the ginseng family, which was one, \\"among the number of unique plants of that country\\". Sarrazin grew ginseng in his garden for future study, and sent the first sample of the specimen back to the Jardin du Roi in 1701. The most interesting specimen discovered by Sarrazin is likely Sarracenia purpurea, the pitcher plant, a plant which was previously unknown in France. Linneaus would name the genus Sarracenia in his honor. He maintained that this plant caught insects and ate them, a theory which was dismissed by the academic community. It was only later, when Charles Darwin published his dissertation in 1875, Insectivorous Plants, that this was validated. This plant, found mainly in bogs and marshes around Québec, proved to be an effective treatment for smallpox, a disease which plagued Europe and America at the time. Other discoveries included l’Arum Canadense, which could treat tumours, l’Aralia canadensis, which treats ulcers, , for epileptic seizures, and l’Angelica Canadensis tenufolia asphodeli radice which can be used as a sedative. Moreover, the native people of New France taught Sarrazin that the sap from Arbor acadiensis could be used to treat sores. As a correspondent of the Académie Royale des Sciences, Sarrazin consistently sent samples back to Paris, with no expectation of recognition. New France's uncharted lands proved challenging to botanists, as Sarrazin stated in his correspondence, \\"I could cross all of Europe more easily, and with less danger, than I could cross 100 leagues in Canada\\". One of Sarrazin's Paris correspondents, Sebastien Vaillant, compiled the documents and specimens sent to New France from Sarrazin into a book published in 1708 titled \\"Histoires des plantes de Canada\\". This was the first French botanical text of this nature studying North American flora and fauna. However, Sarrazin's work remained largely unpublished. His only publication by the Académie Royale des Sciences discussed the syrup extraction process of Canadian maple trees, which can be found in \\"Observations botaniques.\\" Moreover, Sarrazin printed his observations on the fauna of New France as well, notably describing the beaver, the muskrat, the porcupine, the harbour seal, and the wolverine. Therefore, Sarrazin allowed the people of France to acquire more extensive and diverse knowledge on the flora and fauna of New France. Sarrazin was also a surgeon, and although he was not permitted to diagnose illnesses or prescribe medication, he was adept at healing fractures, bandaging wounds, draining abscesses and bleeding patients. Sarrazin was the only certified surgeon present during a smallpox epidemic aboard a ship anchored in Québec, the Diligente, and thus was in charge of medical procedure surrounding the ordeal. While there was no treatment for smallpox, Sarrazin was successful in preventing the spread of disease and in alleviating the pain of his patients by administering cold baths for the fever and powder for the sores.  Notable Achievement  On May 29, 1700, at the Hotel-Dieu of Québec, Sarrazin performed what seems to be the first mastectomy in North America. The surgery was performed on Sister Marie Barbier de l’Assomption, who had been Mother Superior of the Congregation Notre-Dame in Montréal. Sarrazin’s own concerns for the nun are apparent in his writings; \\"No matter what option I choose, I see my Sister de l’Assomption in danger of an imminent death. If we don’t operate, she will surely die within a few days, since she is getting worse by the day; and to attempt an operation will nearly inevitably lead to her death, since there is hardly any hope that she could sustain it and even less hope that she could recover from it\\". The operation was a resounding success, and the nun lived for another 39 years, passing away at the age of 77. Sarrazin’s specimens can now be found in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, in Paris; including a specimen of Sarracenia purpurea.  Maison Michel-Sarrazin  The Maison Michel-Sarrazin is a private palliative care, non-profit hospital. The House opened its doors in 1985 and since then has treated over 7,000 patients. In 2010, the House celebrated its 25th anniversary. = Le Prix Michel Sarrazin = The Michel Sarrazin Award recognizes the scientific career and outstanding contribution of an experienced Québécois scientist. It is awarded annually to a scientist who, through innovation and productivity, has contributed in vital ways to the advancement of biomedical research. Notes References * Eccles, W. J.

It was developed for Core Design by Dimension Creative Designs by Bill Allen with graphics and design by Kevin Bulmer. The PC and Sega versions were published by Virgin Games. Originally released for Amiga in 1990, it is one of the earliest 3D first-person shooter games, predating ID Software's Wolfenstein 3D (1992). It was also the first of its kind to utilize dynamic lighting. Gameplay was very complex for its time, featuring role-playing, stealth and hacking elements, similar to the later System Shock and Deus Ex series of games. Plot Corporation is set in a dark future, and centers around the Universal Cybernetics Corporation, or U.C.C., responsible for employing a large percentage of the population of London and is a keystone in the stability of the economy, thus controlling the government's popularity. U.C.C.'s London headquarters' factory is under the government suspicion of illegally producing genetically engineered hostile mutants. The U.C.C. is a successful \\"corporation\\" that works with pride on (legal) genetic experiments, cybernetic implants and body modifications. Recently, however, one of the U.C.C.'s experiments has escaped and is wreaking havoc on London, which is where the player comes in, taking control of a national security spy working for the agency known as ZODIAC, assigned to infiltrate and expose the illegal activity. Corporation is an early example of a 3D first person shooter. Gameplay The player is given the option of choosing between one of six agents (two men, two women, and two androids, each with variable ability and skill levels). The game is played in a first-person perspective, rendered with 3D polygon environments. The agent lands on the building's roof with the goal of to progressing from the fifth floor down to the basement on level eight. The mission involves the search of incriminating evidence, which would allow the authorities to shut down the illegal genetic experiments taking place. Game elements include hacking electronic door locks from terminals, avoiding alarm triggers and security cameras, battling enemies, and staying alive through the planned use of the items bought in advance before the mission. The conservation of energy is key, but more batteries can be found as floor pick- up items. In a special menu the player is able to heal wounds on specific parts of body, manage various electronic devices scattered throughout the game, apply body modifications and other items, and gather information. In order to reach lower floors, the player must locate special key cards or terminals to acquire higher security clearances to operate the elevators. The Amiga and Atari ST version also had customisable content: a request could be sent to Core with details of the player and a passport photograph. Core would then send the player a floppy diskette containing the sent data that could then be loaded after inserting and loading the data from the first disk. Expansion In 1991, an expansion pack with 16 new levels titled the Corporation Mission Disk was released for the Amiga & Atari ST. Reception The game received very high marks in magazines but had problems with the blocky controls, non-textured polygon surfaces, high difficulty, and realism. References *Hall II, Lyle J.

It is one of the most common forms of English for specific purposes (ESP). An EAP program focuses instruction on skills required to perform in an English-speaking academic context across core subject areas generally encountered in a university setting. Programs may also include a more narrow focus on the more specific linguistic demands of a particular area of study, for example business subjects. Programs may be divided into pre-sessional courses and courses taken alongside students' other subjects. In the former case, sometimes EAP courses may be intended to raise students' general English levels so that they can enter university. In the United Kingdom, this often means endeavouring to help students get a score of 6 or above in the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) examination. In the US, this can mean helping students attain a score of 80 or greater on the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or more than 4 on the ITEP (International Test of English Proficency). Outside Anglophone countries, English-medium universities may have a preparatory school where students can spend a year or two working on their English and academic skills before starting degree courses. EAP courses running alongside other degree courses may be based on the American English and Composition model, or may employ Content-based instruction, either using material from the students' degree subjects or as an independent, elective-like course. These in-sessional courses may be desirable more to help students develop study skills and required academic practices than for language development. In common with most language teaching, EAP instruction teaches vocabulary, grammar and the four skills (reading, writing, speaking - including pronunciation - and listening), but usually tries to tie these to the specific study needs of students; for example, a writing lesson would focus on writing essays rather than, say, business letters. Similarly, the vocabulary chosen for study tends to be based on academic texts. In addition, EAP practitioners often find that, either directly or indirectly, they are teaching study skills and often having to tackle differences in educational culture, such as differing attitudes to plagiarism. This trend has become more prominent as the numbers of foreign students attending UK universities, and other institutions across the English- speaking world, has increased over the last decade. There is some debate amongst EAP teachers as to the best way to help students with academic English.http://www.nuis.ac.jp/~hadley/publication/espj-harwood- hadley/critical-pragmatism-proof.pdf On the one hand, students might be taught particular conventions but not expected to understand why they need to adapt their writing; a pragmatic approach. On the other hand, students might be encouraged to challenge writing conventions and only adopt them if they seem justified; a critical approach. Recently attempts have been made to try and reconcile these opposing views. A critical pragmatic approach to EAP encourages students to develop writing conventions required by universities while also encouraging them to think about the reasons why these conventions exist.

Neither river drains into either the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, but rather they created a series of inland lakes. The region was developed for large-scale irrigated cotton agriculture. During the Mexican Revolution, the region was the site of fierce fighting. Following the military phase of the Revolution, the region was part of the agrarian reform under President Lázaro Cárdenas. The dam named for Cárdenas now controls flooding of the rivers, but the groundwater resources are no longer recharged as a result.Mikael D. Wolfe.Watering the Revolution: An Environmental and Technological History of Agrarian Reform in Mexico. Durham: Duke University Press 2017. It is the 8th largest metropolitan area in Mexico. Geography =Municipalities= The Comarca Lagunera is formed by 15 municipios; 5 in Coahuila (Torreón Municipality, Matamoros Municipality, San Pedro Municipality, Francisco I. Madero Municipality, Viesca Municipality) and 10 in Durango (Gómez Palacio Municipality, Lerdo Municipality, Tlahualilo Municipality, Mapimí Municipality, Rodeo Municipality, Nazas Municipality, San Juan de Guadalupe Municipality, San Luis del Cordero Municipality, General Simón Bolívar, San Pedro del Gallo Municipality). =Territory= It covers an area of out of which belong to Coahuila and to Durango, which makes it 2.5 percent of the national area. =Borders= It borders north with the state of Chihuahua, and with Sierra Mojada Municipality and Cuatrociénegas Municipality of Coahuila, to the west with Indé Municipality and Hidalgo Municipality in Durango, to the southwest with the state of Zacatecas and to the east with Parras Municipality in Coahuila. This polygon is located in the north-central part of Mexico, between the parallels 24° 22' and 26° 23' North and meridians 102° 22' and 104° 47' West in the southernmost part of the Bolsón de Mapimí. The average altitude of the region is of . =Hydrology= Rio Nazas The Comarca Lagunera is subject to periodic flooding due to the overflowing of its principal rivers. Nazas River The Nazas River, average flow of 1,900 cubic meters per second, is formed from the merging of the Sextín River and the Ramos River. In its transit towards the Laguna de Mayrán it is contained in the Lázaro Cárdenas dam (3,336 million cubic meters). In its course it receives the flows of the Vizcaíno, Peñón, San Juan, Naitcha and Cuencamé creeks, and finally stops at the Francisco Zarco Dam (436 million cubic meters). Aguanaval River The Aguanaval River, which has an average flow of 600 cubic meters per second, is formed from the fusion of the Saín Alto River and Trujillo River in Zacatecas. It receives the flows of the Reyes, Santiago and Mazamitote creeks. Other There are other important hydrologic components in the Comarca Lagunera region. The Benjamín Ortega Cantero dam in the municipio of Mapimí, the Francisco González de la Vega dam in Rodeo, the Los Naranjos dam in Simón Bolívar and the Cinco de Mayo dam in San Pedro del Gallo. Also, the Mayrán and Viesca lagoons are big natural dams that constitute dry beds at the moment, and are unable to be filled due to the dams located in the Nazas River for the Mayrán lagoon and the city of Matamoros being in the Aguanaval River's flood path. =Orography= The region is conformed by a large and truncated mountain range, in which several prominent features can be seen constituted by sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic, where important marble and other non-ferrous minerals are exploited. The most important features within the Comarca Lagunera are the Sierra de Jimulco (altitude of 3,120 m), the Sierra del Rosario (altitude of 2,820 m), and the Sierra de Tlahualilo (altitude of 2,200 m). History Utopy or project La Laguna State. In the 1980s, proposals began being made that Comarca Lagunera become Mexico's 33rd state, separating from Coahuila and Durango. In the late 1980s, three unsuccessful attempts were made in Congress to approve Comarca Laguna's statehood. Discussions have continued for decades, with no progress, until 2013, when a project named ELLA (Estado de La Laguna) presented the government with an updated proposal, arguing that statehood would help alleviate the issues of drought and poverty that plague the area. They say that the states of Durango and Coahuila provide a disproportionately small share of funding compared to what the region provides in taxes, labor and production. The group gathered over 500,000 petition signatures in support of the proposal. In January 2014, the Mexican government responded, agreeing to take the proposal under consideration. Weather It has average heat throughout the year, with an average temperature of 22 °C (72 °F) and extreme dryness, with an average rainfall of 300 mm (12 in). There is an average of 22 cold days a year, with temperatures ranging lows of 0 °C (32 °F) and highs of 40 °C (104 °F) Population The economic rise of the Comarca Lagunera is centralized in an urban center formed by the cities of Lerdo, Gómez Palacio, and Torreón. This major settlement has, as of 2000, a population of 1,249,442, out of which 912,822 are located in the urban area and 336,620 in rural settlements, making it the 8th largest metropolitan area in Mexico . Economy Airport Francisco Sarabia in Torreón The Comarca Lagunera is Mexico's most important milk producer with a 14 percent of the national production of milk, 3.6 million liters of milk a day. And within the city of Torreón lies the largest silver refinery of the world, Met-Mex Peñoles. The Comarca is an important producer of raw materials and finished products: among which are cement, fertilizers, non-ferrous metals, marble, milk-derivates, among others. One of the most important activities is that of the maquiladora (assembly plant) industry of clothing, car parts and electrical components. Education The region has a total of 32 professional studies centers, universities, community colleges, and technical institutes. The most important in the region are the Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila, the Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Laguna, the Universidad Iberoamericana, Universidad Autónoma de la Laguna, Universidad La Salle and the Tecnológico de la Laguna.

Publication date: 21 July 2005. Between 1943 and January 1945 during World War II, the camp in Świętochłowice operated as German Nazi Arbeitslager. It was a labour subcamp (Arbeitslager Eintrachtshütte) or the Eintrachthütte concentration camp of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. After the NKVD transfer of the facility to MBP, Colonel Salomon Morel became the commander of the renamed Zgoda camp on 15 March 1945.Dr. Adam Dziurok, Obóz Pracy Świętochłowice-Zgoda. Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, 2010 Zgoda Labour Camp operation The Nazi German camp was evacuated by the Germans before 23 January 1945. However, its infrastructure was left intact and after a few weeks the camp was restored by the NKVD, disinfected, and repopulated in February 1945 with Silesian prisoners from Katowice, Bielsko and Nysa. It continued to be used until November of the same year, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland. It was one of several camps of this type in Silesia (the central camp was the one in Jaworzno).(in Polish) \\"Historia Obozu Pracy w Świętochłowicach\\" (History of the Labour Camp in Swietochlowice\\") The Institute of National Remembrance (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, web site, accessed 2009-04-29. IPN archives) Following World War II, the communist authorities of Poland decided that the Silesian Volksdeutsche from the German DVL groups I and II were to be considered ethnically German. They were believed to have willingly collaborated with the Nazi regime in Upper Silesia during the war and were the subject of judiciary. People who signed or were compelled to sign the Nazi lists III and IV were freed from this procedure providing they swore an oath of loyalty to the Polish state. The decision to treat Silesian prisoners as Germans was motivated by prior dealings with the Volksdeutsche from the Nazi General Government, and did not take into account local conditions under which the population found themselves on DVL lists, often unwillingly. The policy was changed in 1946, and the criteria were no longer based on Volksdeutsche list number, but on specific actions of individual prisoners during the Nazi occupation of Poland. About 6,000 persons were imprisoned at the Zgoda camp, 1/3 of them Germans (1,733 in August 1945 along with those from Upper Silesia). Salomon Morel and the camp at Świętochłowice-Zgoda.

The first inmates were sent there by militia, security services and the Soviet NKVD. Some families took children with them to the camp, but such cases were marginal, and concerned a few mothers who did not want to leave their children alone.Salomon Morel i obóz w Świętochłowicach-Zgodzie The Institute of National Remembrance, web site accessed 2010-07-28 Statistics and witness statements speak of about 2 mothers with children below 1 to 5 years of age and perhaps 2 or 3 children 6 or 7 years old. This was a violation of a directive by Security Department that forbade admitting prisoners along with children below 13 years old, who were ordered to be handed over to state care instead. Most camp inmates were over 40 years old. The majority consisted of Silesians from the Volksliste category I and II as well as ethnic Germans, with some ethnic Poles and at least 38 inmates of other nationalities. Women made up 17% of the camp prisoners in June 1945, but their number went down later (from 716 to just over 300). There was also a large group of people above 60 years old. Among the incarcerated were former Nazi Party members, including those with the rank of Ortsgruppenleiter, for instance several dozen Nazis from Prudnik and Głubczyce. Some inmates have been sentenced by the courts for criminal acts during Nazi occupation of Poland, one was sentenced for four years for oppressing the Polish population during the war. Death toll Memorial plate Documented figures show that 1,855 prisoners lost their lives at Zgoda camp from February until November 1945. Most died during the typhus epidemic, that reached its highest death toll in August, claiming 1,600 victims.Marek Klecel, \\"Dziedzictwo Auschwitz i Gułagu.\\" Based on: Bogusław Kopka, Obozy pracy w Polsce 1944 - 1950. Przewodnik encyklopedyczny. Niezależna Oficyna Wydawnicza Nowa, Warszawa 2003. No medical help was offered to prisoners, and no action taken, until the epidemic spread across the entire camp. The bodies of the dead were being piled up on carts at night and taken outside the camp to hastily dug out mass graves. Eventually, a medical team was sent in, which vaccinated the remaining population. The inmates were systematically maltreated and tortured by the guards including by Morel himself, who used to make pyramids of beaten prisoners (up to six layers high) causing suffocation. The camp was one of the most cruel Stalinist detention facilities in Silesia where communist crimes recognized by international law as crimes against humanity were being committed against the Silesian prisoners under the command of only two men, Aleksy Krut, and Salomon Morel who was running the camp alone from June 1945. Morel, a former member of the communist underground army Armia Ludowa, claimed that his family perished during the Holocaust at the hands of the Nazis.Józef Krzyk, \\"Komendant stalinowskich obozów bez renty,\\" Gazeta Wyborcza, Katowice, 14 February 2006 He did not inform his superiors about the typhus epidemic until the news of the situation was reported by the local newspapers. He notified the local prosecutor, who in response ordered that no new prisoners be sent to the camp. For his negligence and for allowing the epidemic to take its toll, as well as for the failure to uphold his duties as commander of the camp, Morel was punished by a three-day house arrest and temporary reduction of pay by 50%. In his defence, Morel claimed that the camp was overcrowded and most of the inmates arrived already sick, and that the camp administration left him with no means to stop the disease. His statements however, were contradicted by official records. He was also reprimanded by the prosecutor for failing to send back to prison detainees who had arrest warrants issued against them, and instead keeping them in the camp. The Zgoda camp was closed in November 1945 based on general order of the Minister of Security Stanisław Radkiewicz, issued 15 September 1945. The paper instructed to resolve all cases of detention of persons without prosecutor sanctions issued upon them. According to Morel, the camp was no longer needed. Almost all the remaining prisoners were released. However, they first had to sign an oath, under the penalty of prison, to never disclose the events witnessed in the camp. For years, the history of the camp lived exclusively in the memories of its former prisoners and their families, carefully hidden for fear of repressions for revealing how the native people of Silesia were treated. After the fall of communism, Morel left Poland for Israel in 1992. He was subsequently wanted by the Polish authorities for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Poland requested his extradition twice and denied him his police pension. \\"Renta Morela została zawieszona.\\" Presspublica, rp.pl/archivum. Israel refused to extradite him.

Polskie obozy koncentracyjne (\\"The little crime: Polish concentration camps\\") about Zgoda and other Polish concentration camps that operated after the war. Maciej Świrski of the Polish League Against Defamation brought a lawsuit against Newsweek.pl for a 2017 article reviewing Łuszczyna's book in which it referred to Zgoda as a \\"Polish concentration camp\\". Świrski argued that, because the camp was initially established by Soviet authorities, it should be described as a \\"\\"communist labor camp\\". In 2018, a court ruled in his favor and Newsweek.pl had to publish an apology stating that there was no such thing as Polish concentration camps. However, Zgoda is described as a concentration camp by Gazeta Wyborcza, Die Zeit, Deutschlandfunk, and other sources. The guards at the camp were mostly Polish and they forced non-Polish speaking prisoners to learn Polish songs and Catholic prayers.

This article details the practices used in this methodology. Extreme programming has 12 practices, grouped into four areas, derived from the best practices of software engineering.Beck, K. Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change 2nd. ed. Addison-Wesley, 2000 pp. 54 Fine scale feedback = Pair programming = Pair programming means that all code is produced by two people programming on one task on one workstation. One programmer has control over the workstation and is thinking mostly about the coding in detail. The other programmer is more focused on the big picture, and is continually reviewing the code that is being produced by the first programmer. Programmers trade roles after minute to hour periods. The pairs are not fixed; programmers switch partners frequently, so that everyone knows what everyone is doing, and everybody remains familiar with the whole system, even the parts outside their skill set. This way, pair programming also can enhance team-wide communication. (This also goes hand-in-hand with the concept of Collective Ownership). = Planning game = The main planning process within extreme programming is called the Planning Game. The game is a meeting that occurs once per iteration, typically once a week. The planning process is divided into two parts: *Release Planning: This is focused on determining what requirements are included in which near-term releases, and when they should be delivered. The customers and developers are both part of this. Release Planning consists of three phases: **Exploration Phase: In this phase the customer will provide a shortlist of high-value requirements for the system. These will be written down on user story cards. **Commitment Phase: Within the commitment phase business and developers will commit themselves to the functionality that will be included and the date of the next release. **Steering Phase: In the steering phase the plan can be adjusted, new requirements can be added and/or existing requirements can be changed or removed. *Iteration Planning: This plans the activities and tasks of the developers. In this process the customer is not involved. Iteration Planning also consists of three phases: **Exploration Phase: Within this phase the requirement will be translated to different tasks. The tasks are recorded on task cards. **Commitment Phase: The tasks will be assigned to the programmers and the time it takes to complete will be estimated. **Steering Phase: The tasks are performed and the end result is matched with the original user story. The purpose of the Planning Game is to guide the product into delivery. Instead of predicting the exact dates of when deliverables will be needed and produced, which is difficult to do, it aims to \\"steer the project\\" into delivery using a straightforward approach. The Planning Game approach has also been adopted by non-software projects and teams in the context of business agility.Leybourn, E. (2013). Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management. London: IT Governance Publishing: 146–150.  Release planning  = Exploration phase = This is an iterative process of gathering requirements and estimating the work impact of each of those requirements. *Write a Story: Business has come with a problem; during a meeting, development will try to define this problem and get requirements. Based on the business problem, a story (user story) has to be written. This is done by business, where they point out what they want a part of the system to do. It is important that development has no influence on this story. The story is written on a user story card. *Estimate a Story: Development estimates how long it will take to implement the work implied by the story card. Development can also create spike solutions to analyze or solve the problem. These solutions are used for estimation and discarded once everyone gets clear visualization of the problem. Again, this may not influence the business requirements. *Split a Story: Every design critical complexity has to be addressed before starting the iteration planning. If development isn't able to estimate the story, it needs to be split up and written again. When business cannot come up with any more requirements, one proceeds to the commitment phase. = Commitment phase = This phase involves the determination of costs, benefits, and schedule impact. It has four components: *Sort by Value: Business sorts the user stories by Business Value. *Sort by Risk: Development sorts the stories by risk. *Set Velocity: Development determines at what speed they can perform the project. *Choose scope: The user stories that will be finished in the next release will be picked. Based on the user stories the release date is determined.  Sort by value  The business side sorts the user stories by business value. They will arrange them into three piles: *Critical: stories without which the system cannot function or has no meaning. *Significant Business Value: Non-critical user stories that have significant business value. *Nice to have: User stories that do not have significant business value.  Sort by risk  The developers sort the user stories by risk. They also categorize into three piles: low, medium and high risk user stories. The following is an example of an approach to this: *Determine Risk Index: Give each user story an index from 0 to 2 on each of the following factors: **Completeness (do we know all of the story details?) ***Complete (0) ***Incomplete (1) ***Unknown (2) **Volatility (is it likely to change?) ***low (0) ***medium (1) ***high (2) **Complexity (how hard is it to build?) ***simple (0) ***standard (1) ***complex (2) All indexes for a user story are added, assigning the user stories a risk index of low (0-1), medium (2-4), or high (5-6). = Steering phase = Within the steering phase the programmers and business people can \\"steer\\" the process. That is to say, they can make changes. Individual user stories, or relative priorities of different user stories, might change; estimates might prove wrong. This is the chance to adjust the plan accordingly.  Iteration planning  Considering team velocity storypoints to be planned. Iteration duration can be 1 to 3 weeks. = Exploration phase = The exploration phase of the iteration planning is about creating tasks and estimating their implementation time. *Translate the requirement to tasks: Place on task cards. *Combine/Split task: If the programmer cannot estimate the task because it is too small or too big, the programmer will need to combine or split the task. *Estimate task: Estimate the time it will take to implement the task. = Commitment phase = Within the commitment phase of the iteration planning programmers are assigned tasks that reference the different user stories. *A programmer accepts a task: Each programmer picks a task for which he or she takes responsibility. *Programmer estimates the task: Because the programmer is now responsible for the task, he or she should give the eventual estimation of the task. *Set load factor: The load factor represents the ideal amount of hands-on development time per programmer within one iteration. For example, in a 40-hour week, with 5 hours dedicated to meetings, this would be no more than 35 hours. *Balancing: When all programmers within the team have been assigned tasks, a comparison is made between the estimated time of the tasks and the load factor. Then the tasks are balanced out among the programmers. If a programmer is overcommitted, other programmers must take over some of his or her tasks and vice versa. = Steering phase = The implementation of the tasks is done during the steering phase of the iteration. * Get a task card: The programmer gets the task card for one of the tasks to which he or she has committed. * Find a Partner: The programmer will implement this task along with another programmer. This is further discussed in the practice Pair Programming. * Design the task: If needed, the programmers will design the functionality of the task. * Implement the task using Test-driven development (TDD) (see below) * Run Functional test: Functional tests (based on the requirements in the associated user story and task card) are run. = Test driven development = Unit tests are automated tests that test the functionality of pieces of the code (e.g. classes, methods). Within XP, unit tests are written before the eventual code is coded. This approach is intended to stimulate the programmer to think about conditions in which his or her code could fail. XP says that the programmer is finished with a certain piece of code when he or she cannot come up with any further conditions under which the code may fail. Test driven development proceeds by quickly cycling through the following steps, with each step taking minutes at most, preferably much less. Since each user story will usually require one to two days of work, a very large number of such cycles will be necessary per story. * Write unit test: The programmers write a minimal test that should fail because the functionality hasn't been fully implemented in the production code. * Watch the new test fail: The programmers verify the test does indeed fail. While it may seem like a waste of time, this step is critical because it verifies that your belief about the state of the production code is correct. If the test does not fail, the programmers should determine whether there is a bug in the test code, or that the production code does support the functionality described by the new test. * Write code: The programmers write just enough production code so the new test will pass. * Run test: The unit tests are executed to verify that the new production code passes the new test, and that no other tests are failing. * Refactor: Remove any code smells from both the production and test code. For a more intense version of the above process, see Uncle Bob's Three Rules of TDD. = Whole team = Within XP, the \\"customer\\" is not the one who pays the bill, but the one who really uses the system. XP says that the customer should be on hand at all times and available for questions. For instance, the team developing a financial administration system should include a financial administrator. Continuous process = Continuous integration = The development team should always be working on the latest version of the software. Since different team members may have versions saved locally with various changes and improvements, they should try to upload their current version to the code repository every few hours, or when a significant break presents itself. Continuous integration will avoid delays later on in the project cycle, caused by integration problems. = Design improvement = Because XP doctrine advocates programming only what is needed today, and implementing it as simply as possible, at times this may result in a system that is stuck. One of the symptoms of this is the need for dual (or multiple) maintenance: functional changes start requiring changes to multiple copies of the same (or similar) code. Another symptom is that changes in one part of the code affect many other parts. XP doctrine says that when this occurs, the system is telling you to refactor your code by changing the architecture, making it simpler and more generic. = Small releases = The delivery of the software is done via frequent releases of live functionality creating concrete value. The small releases help the customer to gain confidence in the progress of the project. This helps maintain the concept of the whole team as the customer can now come up with his suggestions on the project based on real experience. Shared understanding = Coding standard = Coding standard is an agreed upon set of rules that the entire development team agree to adhere to throughout the project. The standard specifies a consistent style and format for source code, within the chosen programming language, as well as various programming constructs and patterns that should be avoided in order to reduce the probability of defects. The coding standard may be a standard conventions specified by the language vendor (e.g. The Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language, recommended by Sun), or custom defined by the development team. Extreme Programming backers advocate code that is self-documenting to the furthest degree possible. This reduces the need for code comments, which can get out of sync with the code itself.http://guzdial.cc.gatech.edu/squeakbook/new-lecture-slides/xp.ppt = Collective code ownership = Collective code ownership (also known as \\"team code ownership\\" and \\"shared code\\") means that everyone is responsible for all the code; therefore, everybody is allowed to change any part of the code. Collective code ownership is not only an organizational policy but also a feeling. \\"Developers feel team code ownership more when they understand the system context, have contributed to the code in question, perceive code quality as high, believe the product will satisfy the user needs, and perceive high team cohesion.\\" Pair programming, especially overlapping pair rotation, contributes to this practice: by working in different pairs, programmers better understand the system context and contribute to more areas of the code base. Collective code ownership may accelerate development because a developer who spots an error can fix it immediately, which can reduce bugs overall. However, programmers may also introduce bugs when changing code that they do not understand well. Sufficiently well-defined unit tests should mitigate this problem: if unforeseen dependencies create errors, then when unit tests are run, they will show failures. Collective code ownership may lead to better member backup, greater distribution of knowledge and learning, shared responsibility of the code, greater code quality, and reduced rework. But it may as well lead to increased member conflict, increase of bugs, changes of developers mental flow and breaks of their reasoning, increased development time, or less understanding of the code.Ribeiro, Danilo & Silva, Fabio & Valença, Diana & Freitas, Elyda & França, César. (2016). Advantages and Disadvantages of using Shared code from the Developers Perspective: A qualitative study. = Simple design = Programmers should take a \\"simple is best\\" approach to software design. Whenever a new piece of code is written, the author should ask themselves 'is there a simpler way to introduce the same functionality?'. If the answer is yes, the simpler course should be chosen. Refactoring should also be used to make complex code simpler. = System metaphor = The system metaphor is a story that everyone - customers, programmers, and managers - can tell about how the system works. It's a naming concept for classes and methods that should make it easy for a team member to guess the functionality of a particular class/method, from its name only. For example a library system may create \`loan_records(class)\` for \`borrowers(class)\`, and if the item were to become overdue it may perform a make_overdue operation on a \`catalogue(class)\`. For each class or operation the functionality is obvious to the entire team. Programmer welfare = Sustainable pace = The concept is that programmers or software developers should not work more than 40 hour weeks, and if there is overtime one week, that the next week should not include more overtime. Since the development cycles are short cycles of continuous integration, and full development (release) cycles are more frequent, the projects in XP do not follow the typical crunch time that other projects require (requiring overtime). Also, included in this concept is that people perform best and most creatively if they are well rested. A key enabler to achieve sustainable pace is frequent code-merge and always executable & test covered high quality code. The constant refactoring way of working enforces team members with fresh and alert minds. The intense collaborative way of working within the team drives a need to recharge over weekends. Well-tested, continuously integrated, frequently deployed code and environments also minimize the frequency of unexpected production problems and outages, and the associated after-hours nights and weekends work that is required.

She was the chairperson of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway from 1988 to 2016, and also of Hulman & Company. Family Mari was the Hulmans' only child, but from the age of eleven she was often surrounded by the families of Indianapolis 500 drivers, whom she befriended. She married one such driver, Elmer George, on April 29, 1957. At 22 years of age, she became stepmother to Elmer's children from his first marriage, and the couple would go on to have four children together: three daughters, Nancy, Josie, and Kathi; and one son, Anton Hulman George, who, like his namesake grandfather, would be better known as \\"Tony.\\" Elmer George, who met with little success as a driver, retired from racing in 1963. He later became a Speedway vice-president and head of the IMS Radio Network. For most of the couple's marriage, they owned a farm outside of Terre Haute, but spent much of their time at their ranch in Wyoming. Mari filed for divorce from Elmer in May 1976. Only four weeks after this, Elmer was shot multiple times and killed by Guy Trollinger, the family's horse trainer and Mari's alleged boyfriend, after an argument at Elmer and Mari's ranch in Terre Haute late at night on the day of that year's Indianapolis 500. On November 3, 2018 Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced that Mari Hulman George had died. Chairperson Mari Hulman George at the 1997 Indianapolis 500 After the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, his widow Mary F. Hulman (Mari's mother) was named the chairperson of the board of directors of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Hulman & Co., the family's primary business. Mari Hulman George was named to the position of vice president and board member. When Mary F. Hulman's health began to decline, she retired and was named chairman emeritus, a position she held until her death in 1998. The chairmanship of the companies was passed to Mari Hulman George in 1988. Mari Hulman George held those positions until the summer of 2016. Shortly after the 2016 Indianapolis 500, Mari was facing declining health and was elected chairman emeritus of the family companies. At that same time, her son Tony George was elevated to the chairman position. Like her father and mother before her, from 1997 to 2015 Mari officially started the Indianapolis 500 and Brickyard 400 races with the famous starting command, \\"(Ladies and) Gentlemen, start your engines!\\" In 2014, she was joined by Jim Nabors, and for the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 in 2016, she was joined by the entire Hulman/George family. Mari had also given the command as a substitute for her mother in 1981. Philanthropist and lover of animals Like her parents, Mari Hulman George is well-known throughout Indiana for her generosity to institutions of higher learning, with her alma mater, St. Mary-of-the-Woods College in Saint Mary-of- the-Woods, Indiana among the top beneficiaries. The college maintains the Mari Hulman George School of Equine Studies, founded in part due to her love of horses. In 2001, the Indiana Department of Homeland Security renamed their search-and-rescue training area at Camp Atterbury the Mari Hulman George Search and Rescue Training Center, in recognition of her contributions to the care of animals displaced and otherwise affected by disasters. She has also been active in the rescue and adoption of racing greyhounds.

A land-grant university with nearly 75,000 students across four traditional campuses, a statewide technology program, extension centers, and continuing education programs, as well as another 30,000 students enrolled in an online university. Each university in the system maintains its own faculty and admissions policies which are overseen by the Purdue University Board of Trustees. Purdue's main campus in West Lafayette is the best-known, noted for its highly regarded programs in engineering and adjacent subjects. Purdue West Lafayette Purdue University’s main and largest campus is located in West Lafayette, Indiana, on the banks of the Wabash River. This main campus anchors the Purdue system statewide, which comprises regional campuses, satellite technology-training centers, and county agricultural extension offices.  Purdue statewide  =Regional campuses= Purdue University formerly operated two regional campuses, Purdue Calumet in Hammond and Purdue North Central near Westville. In 2016, Purdue combined the curriculum for its two regional campuses and now houses it under one name: Purdue University Northwest (PNW). PNW runs two campuses in Northwest Indiana. The newest Purdue campus is Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW) in Fort Wayne, which began operation on July 1, 2018, following the dissolution of Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW). The latter school had been a joint venture between the Purdue and Indiana University systems under the budgetary administration of the Purdue system, but the systems agreed to split IPFW's academic programs, with all IPFW health sciences programs now part of Indiana University Fort Wayne and all other academic programs now operated under the auspices of PFW. Two joint IU–Purdue campuses remain in operation: IUPUI in Indianapolis, and IUPUC in Columbus. IUPUI is integrated into the IU system budget, but is otherwise semi-autonomous (including independent control of its own academic curricula) and degree-granting in over 175 programs. IU–PU Columbus is a regional campus, similar to PNW and PFW, but administered through IUPUI. =Technology centers= In addition to its main location in West Lafayette, the Purdue Polytechnic Institute, one of the 10 academic colleges at Purdue University, operates nine satellite locations across Indiana. Degree programs at each location are regionally determined by current and projected workforce needs within the region. These are located in Anderson, Columbus, Indianapolis, Kokomo, Lafayette, New Albany, Richmond, Vincennes, and South Bend.https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/locations These locations offer certificate, associate, and/or bachelor's degrees, some of which are ABET-accredited technical degrees. =County cooperative extension offices= In conjunction with the state of Indiana, Purdue University operates a cooperative extension office in each of Indiana'a 92 counties. Each office provides information and analysis for farmers, agricultural-industry employees, gardeners, naturalists, and homeowners. Cooperative Extension also includes youth development, family and consumer sciences, and community development. Online programs = Purdue Global = Purdue University Global, (PG), is an adult-serving public university, operated as part of the Purdue system, primarily online. As with other campuses in the system, PG has its own faculty, admissions policies, and curriculum but is overseen ultimately by the Purdue University Board of Trustees. Purdue Global offers certificates, and degrees at the associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level. Diplomas given by Purdue Global differ from other schools in the Purdue system, and have a different name, font, and bear the PG logo in place of the Seal of the Purdue University Board of Trustees. =Purdue Online= Purdue Online is the administrative unit charged with planning and enabling Purdue's effort to unify the online offerings by Purdue West Lafayette, Purdue Fort Wayne, Purdue Northwest, and Purdue Global. The initiative was approved by Purdue President Mitch Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees in December 2018. History =Founding of the main campus= The state of Indiana received a gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the college would be founded near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution's principal benefactor. Classes first began at the Purdue main campus on September 16, 1874. Purdue issued its first degree, a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, in 1875. Architecturally, buildings at the West Lafayette campus generally feature red brick. =Extension centers become degree-granting regional campuses= After the return of a large number of veterans at the close of World War II, Purdue University opened over forty extension centers throughout Indiana.Purdue University North Central: About PNC Through these many extension centers Purdue University offered freshman- level classes for both the purpose of the convenience of students starting their college studies close to their residence before taking the more major step of transferring to the main campus in West Lafayette as well as the purpose of off-loading a substantial number of freshmen from residential and classroom resources that were in short supply on the main campus in order to handle the rapid major expansion in enrollment following the periods of smaller enrollment during both the Great Depression and World War II. Of these over forty extension centers, five were retained over the multiple decades since WWII and transformed into institutions that grant degrees that require four or more years of study. Of these five, three of them—PFW, IUPUI, and Purdue Calumet (now part of Purdue Northwest)—are medium-sized residential, research universities that each grant 100 to 200 different degrees, majors, or programs across a wide diversity of areas of study. In fact, with enrollment approaching 30,000 students, IUPUI is more properly categorized as a large university in its own right that grants doctorate degrees as well as master's, bachelor's, and associate degrees, but at IUPUI the number of Indiana University programs and students is significantly larger than the number of Purdue University programs and students. Purdue University Fort Wayne Following the lead of Indiana University's downtown Fort Wayne extension center that was established in 1917, Purdue University founded the Purdue Fort Wayne Extension Center downtown in the fall of 1941 to provide a site in Fort Wayne for students to begin their undergraduate studies prior to transferring to the West Lafayette main campus to complete their degree. Under the direction of Purdue University president Frederick Hovde, Indiana University President Herman Wells, IU trustee John Hastings, and Purdue Trustee Alfred Kettler Sr., the Indiana University and Purdue University extension centers began merging in 1958. To serve the extension centers' combined mission in Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne's Indiana-Purdue Foundation purchased of farmland at the then-suburban northern edge of Fort Wayne. The new Indiana University—Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) campus opened on September 17, 1964 following nearly two years of construction that began on October 18, 1962. At the time of its dissolution in 2018, IPFW was a campus on both sides of the Saint Joseph River with 13 educational buildings, plus student residences and various other athletic facilities and parking structures. IPFW awarded its first four-year degree in 1968 after awarding two-year degrees through the IU Fort Wayne extension center prior to the formation of the joint IPFW campus. The joint campus was administered through Purdue University, although the medical programs and the library were administered through Indiana University. IPFW's degrees were awarded by either Purdue University or Indiana University on a program-by-program basis. IPFW's curriculum contained over 170 degrees, majors, or programs. Architecturally, IPFW buildings generally feature brown or tan brick as a variation on Purdue's main campus' red brick. In December 2016, the governing boards of the IU and Purdue systems initially approved a plan to split IPFW into two separate institutions. Both boards gave their final approval to the split in June 2017. Effective July 1, 2018, IPFW's academic programs in health sciences were taken over by IU under the identity of Indiana University Fort Wayne (IUFW). All remaining academic programs moved to the Purdue system under the banner of Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). PFW continues to provide administrative services and general education classes for IUFW students. IPFW's athletic program completely transferred to Purdue Fort Wayne, and shortly before the split took effect, the athletic program renamed itself from Fort Wayne Mastodons to Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons. IUPUI Following the model of the downtown Indianapolis permanent extension center established by Indiana University in 1916, Purdue University founded the Purdue Indianapolis Extension Center downtown in the fall of 1946 to provide a site in Indianapolis for students to begin their undergraduate studies prior to transferring to the West Lafayette main campus to complete their degree. The Indiana University School of Medicine was established at Indianapolis in phases between 1911and 1919. In 1944, Indiana University acquired the Indiana Law School, which is now the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. In 1969, the Purdue University Indianapolis Extension Center merged into the Indiana University Indianapolis campus to form IUPUI. IUPUI awarded its first four-year undergraduate degree in 1970, having previously awarded graduate degrees in law and medicine for decades through the Indiana University Indianapolis campus. In 1974, Indiana University was reorganized to make the Bloomington and Indianapolis campuses the two core campuses of the Indiana University system. IUPUI is administered through Indiana University. IUPUI's Purdue University programs are in two schools that are academically affiliated with Purdue University. IUPUI's degrees are awarded by either Purdue University or Indiana University on a program-by-program basis. IUPUI's curriculum contains over 350 degrees, majors, or programs. Architecturally, IUPUI buildings generally feature Indiana limestone, as IU Bloomington buildings do as well. IUPUI is located on a campus west of downtown Indianapolis. The Purdue University programs at the Purdue Indianapolis Extension Center awarded their first two-year degrees in 1947. IUPUC Indiana University first opened their extension center in Columbus, Indiana, in the fall of 1941. Purdue University first opened their extension center in Columbus in the fall of 1942. IUPUI Columbus began operations on August 17, 1970 as an extension of IUPUI. The building which currently houses IUPUC was first occupied by IUPUI Columbus in 1974. The name of IUPUI Columbus was changed to IUPUC in 1994. IUPUC is administered through IUPUI. IUPUC's degrees are awarded by either Purdue University or Indiana University on a program-by-program basis. Because IUPUC grants only one master's degree, 15 bachelor's degrees, and 6 associate degrees,Academics IUPUC is still in the early part of the transformation from feeder-campus status (where students are expected to transfer to the main campuses of IUPUI, Purdue University, or Indiana University Bloomington for completion of their degree) to full university status (where students can pursue at the same campus any one of a wide diversity of degrees, majors, or programs offered by any of multiple colleges or schools based at that campus). Purdue University Northwest Purdue University Northwest was established in 2016 via the merger of two former Purdue regional campuses—Purdue University Calumet in Hammond and Purdue University North Central in Westville. Both predecessor institutions opened in 1946. Calumet opened as a regional extension, with classes at various locations in the area. All Calumet operations were centralized at a new campus in Hammond in 1951. The campus has remained at this location, but has since expanded to . In 1962, the Purdue system redefined Calumet as a full regional campus, and as a regional university in 1979. After years of offering only associate degrees, it awarded its first bachelor's degrees in spring 1967. Calumet became a residential campus with the 2005 opening of its first residence halls. North Central was also established as a regional extension, initially offering classes in LaPorte and Michigan City. All classes were centralized in 1949, and the university purchased a site in 1962 to begin the process of converting what was then known as the Barker Memorial Center to a full regional campus. The new campus opened in 1967, and has since been expanded to . Athletics Three campuses of the Purdue University system sponsor NCAA Division I teams. The Purdue Boilermakers, representing the West Lafayette main campus, field 18 teams, including the system's only football team. The Boilermakers are members of the Big Ten Conference in the Football Bowl Subdivision. The IUPUI Jaguars and Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons respectively field 14 and 16 teams, with all of both schools' teams except the PFW men's volleyball team competing in the Horizon League. Administration Purdue University is managed by a ten- member board of trustees who are appointed by the governor of Indiana. Three of these trustees are Purdue graduates nominated by the alumni association, while another must be a current full-time student. The university president is the chief executive officer of Purdue. Each campus—with the exceptions of West Lafayette and IUPUC—also has a chancellor. The powers of a chancellor at the West Lafayette campus are exercised by the president. IUPUC's leader has the title of vice-chancellor and serves under the chancellor of IUPUI.

The Highland Council employs about 75 staff which work at the school. The current rector is Mrs H Flavell and the deputy rectors are A Nicoll, C Omand and J Miller. The school has just under 800 students. It consists of two main buildings and three huts.  History  In 1954 Basil Spence & Partners, along with Caithness County Architect Sandy Giavanni, were commissioned by the Thurso County Council to build a new high school. A large green-field site was chosen on the east side of County Road (now designated as Ormlie Road), to the south of the town. Officially opened in October 1958, Thurso High School is the most northerly secondary school on mainland Great Britain. The main campus is made up of a number of informally grouped buildings of varying heights surrounding a central courtyard. Each building is given individual surface treatment and a variety of contrasting materials have been used including Caithness stone, polished stone, timber boarding, and concrete slabs. The building featured a carved granite abstract 'Education' by Ann Henderson RSA, who was born in Thurso and studied and taught at Edinburgh College of Art. The school was commissioned in two phases, the first completed in October 1958 and the second begun in May 1959. The reason for the extension to the school was the growth in Thurso and the surrounding area's population after the development of the Dounreay nuclear power station. Although the school was built in anticipation of a population increase, the growth was greater and more rapid than expected, and at its peak Dounreay's staff of 2,400 people trebled the size of the town.

He initially wrote poetry, but subsequently became a novelist and essayist. His writing style is often said to be abstract and densely metaphorical, and his subject matter wide-ranging. Harris is considered one of the most original and innovative voices in postwar literature in English.  Biography  Wilson Harris was born in New Amsterdam in British Guiana, where his father worked at an insurance company. After studying at Queen's College in the capital of Guyana, Georgetown, he became a government surveyor, before taking up a career as lecturer and writer. The knowledge of the savannas and rain forests he gained during his time as a surveyor formed the setting for many of his books, with the Guyanese landscape dominating his fiction. Between 1945 and 1961, Harris was a regular contributor of stories, poems and essays to Kyk-over-Al literary magazine and was part of a group of Guyanese intellectuals that included Martin Carter and Ivan Van Sertima. Harris came to England in 1959 and published his first novel Palace of the Peacock in 1960. This became the first of a quartet of novels, The Guyana Quartet, which includes The Far Journey of Oudin (1961), The Whole Armour (1962), and The Secret Ladder (1963). He subsequently wrote the Carnival trilogy: Carnival (1985), The Infinite Rehearsal (1987), and The Four Banks of the River of Space (1990). His most recent novels were Jonestown (1996), which tells of the mass-suicide of followers of cult leader Jim Jones, The Dark Jester (2001), a semi-autobiographical novel, The Mask of the Beggar (2003), and The Ghost of Memory (2006). Harris also wrote non-fiction and critical essays and was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of the West Indies (1984) and the University of Liège (2001). He twice won the Guyana Prize for Literature. Harris was created a Knight Bachelor in June 2010, in the Queen Elizabeth II Birthday Honours.\\"Wilson Harris Knighted\\", Stabroek News, 14 June 2010. In 2014, Harris won a Lifetime Achievement Prize from the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards. Criticism Literary critics have stated that although reading Harris's work is challenging, it is rewarding in many ways. Harris has been admired for his exploration of the themes of conquest and colonization as well as the struggles of colonized peoples. Readers have commented that his novels are an attempt to express truths about the way people experience reality through the lens of the imagination. Harris has been faulted for his novels that have often nonlinear plot lines, and for his preference of internal perceptions over external realities. Critics have described Harris's abstract, experimental narratives as difficult to read, dense, complex, or opaque.Criticism for Harris Wilson. Many readers have commented that Harris's essays push the boundaries of traditional literary criticism, and that his fiction pushes the limits of the novel genre itself. Harris's writing has been associated with many different literary genres by critics, including: surrealism, magic realism, mysticism and modernism. Over the years, Harris has used many different concepts to define his literary approach, including: cross-culturalism, modern allegory,Stephen Slemon,\\"Interview with Wilson Harris\\", Ariel 19, no. 3 (July 1988): pp. 47–56. epic, and Quantum Fiction. One critic described Harris's fictions as informed by \\"quantum penetration where Existence and non-existence are both real. You can contemplate them as if both are true.\\" Literary technique The technique of Harris has been called experimental and innovative. Harris describes that conventional writing is different from his style of writing in that \\"conventional writing is straightforward writing\\" and \\"My writing is quantum writing. Do you know of the quantum bullet? The quantum bullet, when it's fired, leaves not one hole but two.\\"Sateesh Maharaj, \\"Sir Wilson Harris\\", Trinidad Express Newspapers, 3 July 2010. The use of nonlinear events and metaphor is a substantive component of his prose. Another technique employed by Harris is the combination of words and concepts in unexpected, jarring ways. Through this technique of combination, Harris displays the underlying, linking root that prevents two categories from ever really existing in opposition. The technique exposes and alters the power of language to lock in fixed beliefs and attitudes, \\"freeing\\" words and concepts to associate in new ways. Harris sees language as the key to social and human transformations. His approach begins with a regard of language as a power to both enslave and free. This quest and understanding underlies his narrative fiction themes about human slavery. Harris cites language as both, a crucial element in the subjugation of slaves and indentures, and the means by which the destructive processes of history could be reversed.David P. Lichtenstein, Wilson Harris – Experimental Vision – Part One: The Technique of Combination; Brown University, 1999. In Palace of the Peacock, Harris seeks to expose the illusion of opposites that create enmities between people. A crew on a river expedition experiences a series of tragedies that ultimately bring about each member's death. Along the way, Harris highlights as prime factor in their demise their inability to reconcile binarisms in the world around them and between each other. With his technique of binary breakdowns, and echoing the African tradition of death not bringing the end to a soul, Harris demonstrates that they find reconciliation only in physical death, pointing out the superficiality of illusions of opposites that separated them.David P. Lichtenstein, Wilson Harris – Experimental Vision – Part Two: Combination and Humanity; Brown University, 1999. Harris noted in an interview that \\"in describing the world you see, the language evolves and begins to encompass realities that are not visible\\".Monica Pozzi, \\"A Conversation with Wilson Harris\\" Hollands, 10 September 1997; Journal of Caribbean Literature, 2.1 – 3 (Spring 2000). Harris attributed his innovative literary techniques as a development that was the result of being witness to the physical world behaving as quantum theory. To accommodate his new perceptions, Harris said he realized he was writing \\"quantum fiction\\".Jefferson-Miles (2002), p. 180. His writing has been called ambitiously experimental and his narrative structure is described as \\"multiple and flexible.\\"Andrew Jefferson-Miles, \\"Quantum Value in Harris's 'architecture of the tides'\\", in Hena Maes-Jelinek & Bénédicte Ledent (eds), Theatre of the Arts: Wilson Harris and the Caribbean, Amsterdam – New York: Editions Rodopi, 2002, p. 178; . Harris categorized his innovations and literary techniques as quantum fiction.Jefferson-Miles (2002), p. 181.Fred D'Aguiar, \\"Wilson Harris\\" (interview), BOMB 82 magazine, Winter 2003.

Biography =Early life= Musso was born Munawar Musso in 1897, Pagu, Kediri. His father was a bank clerk in Wates, Mas Martoredjo. In Batavia, Musso studied at teacher school. He met Alimin, disciple of G.A.J. Hazeu and D. van Hinloopen Labberton. According to Soemarsono, one of PKI leaders in Madiun affair, Musso continued to Hogere Burger School in 1913. Musso stayed at Tjokroaminoto's boarding house with Alimin and Sukarno. According to Arnold C. Brackman, at the time Musso worked as cashier at Surabaya post office. In Surabaya, Musso also met Henk Sneevliet. =Beginning of PKI career= Musso and Alimin had the more important task in infiltrating Sarekat Islam than Surjopranoto. They were members of both the PKI and SI before they were arrested due to Afdeling B affair. Musso was involved in a farmer revolt in Cimareme, Garut supported by Sarekat Islam Afdeling B. In the trial, while Alimin confessed to making a false statement to help Tjokroaminoto, Musso refused to make a confession. In the prison, the Dutch government handled him roughly. Agus Salim complained to Voolksraad for this treatment. According to McVey, Musso held a grudge against the Dutch government after this treatment. After Musso and Alimin were released in 1923, the former was offered to teach Indonesian language with English as language of instruction in Japan by van Hinloopen Labberton. However the Japanese government rejected Musso's explanation that he did not a sufficient academic diploma, though McVey assumed that the main reasons were his experience in prison and his political views. Musso then reorganize Batavia PKI branch and led this new organization. In January 1925, a committee of the Indies National Congress conducted a meeting resulting in the formation of the politically neutral, Surabaya-based Indonesian Study Club association. Musso was present at the club's first convention in February supporting the club agenda and wishing it to be more closer linked to the grassroots. In early 1925, Musso and Alimin gave a speech at a rally organized by the VTSP in Banten increasing communist influence in that region. After the failure of the machinists' strike on 5 October, Musso concluded that the strike had been premature. In December 1925, PKI leaders planned to rebel against the Dutch Indies government. The government knew this and arrested most of the leaders in January 1926. Musso was one of the few who managed to escape. He along with Budisutjitro and Sugono fled to Singapore meeting PKI agent Subakat and Alimin who previously had been staying with Tan Malaka in Manila. The five plus Sardjono, Mohammad Sanusi, and Winanta held discussions for three days before deciding to organize a revolt by the middle of 1926. The meeting also resulted in the sending Alimin to Manila to request Tan Malaka to gam support for the revolt, but this plan was rejected by Tan Malaka. In February, another meeting was held but Alimin made no mention the rejection by Tan Malaka. =Comintern member= Some times in March 1926, Musso and Alimin went to Moscow via Canton to ask for support from Comintern for a revolt. Knowing the plan from meeting in Singapore remained to be implemented, Tan Malaka arrived in Singapore in June to prevent Musso and Alimin, but he was too late because both of them had already gone to Russia. The plan was if they could get support from the Comintern, they would instruct the PKI in Dutch Indies to refrain from beginning a revolt until aid materials arrived. It would be after the arrival of aid, that then PKI would launch a full revolt, else if Comintern didn't support this plan the PKI would launch guerrilla and terror attacks. The Comintern rejected the request reasoning that Dutch Indies government's control was still too strong. To prevent the revolt the plan as proposed by Musso and Alimin, the Comintern instructed them to stay in Moscow longer studying the Trotskyist deviation. However, in October Musso still managed to instruct his people in Dutch Indies to start a revolt. In 1927, Musso and Alimin went to Russia and studied at Lenin school for several years. In July 1928, Musso under the name Manavar along with Alimin, Semaoen, Darsono, and Tadjudin attended the Sixth Congress of Comintern led by Stalin. He expressed his opinion about the failure of the revolt in Jawa and Sumatra the year before. After the congress, Musso served as member of executive committee of Comintern. Musso also continued his study at Lenin University in Moscow but he didn't finish it. Musso married a Russian woman in 1929 and became father of two children. In April 1935, Musso went to Surabaya meeting Siti Larang Djojopanatas, wife of Musso's old friend Sosrokardono to request staying in their residence for several months. Musso was sent there to consolidate the old PKI that crushed in 1927. Musso explained Dimitrov line, a new Communist tactical approach, in several newspaper, including three times inIndonesia Berdjoeang. Focusing in Surabaya and Solo, in this consolidation, Musso managed to persuade Pamudji, Azis, Sukajat, Djoko Soedjono, Amir Sjarifudin, and Tan Ling Djie to join PKI. Musso instructed the new members to infiltrate and join the nationalist organizations. The Dutch Indies government discovered this and exiled the members to Boven Digul. However Musso went back to Moscow before the government arrested and exiled him. Article written in Bintang Merah stated that Musso went to Prague in early November 1947 helping Soeripno that represented Indonesia to discuss consular agreement with USSR. However, Soeripno himself claimed that Musso went there in March 1948. In January 1948 after the signing of Renville Agreement, Musso defended his comrades in Indonesia from criticism by Moscow, especially Amir Sjarifudin, stating that it was \\"just a tactic, in order not to draw attention of anti-communist faction.\\" After the talks in Prague finished on the third week of May that concluded the establishment of diplomatic relations between USSR and Indonesia, Musso, under the name Soeparto, and Soeripno returned to Indonesia on 21 June 1948. They dropped in New Delhi and stayed for half a month or three weeks waiting Indonesian Air Force finished the transaction of aircraft. They join the flight of a newly bought aircraft to Indonesia, stopped by in Thailand then stayed in Bukittinggi for eight days. Musso planned a Communist revolution, consistent with Soviet policy, named A New Road for the Indonesian Republic whether in Prague or on the way home. While in Prague, Musso discussed with Soeripno and Paul de Groot, a Dutch communist, Netherlands- Indonesia relations and whether Indonesia was to become a Netherlands' commonwealth or fully independent. The plan, according to Ann Swift, was doubtlessly approved by Moscow, though Musso himself denied this. According to the former Armed Force Chief of Staff Himawan Soetanto, the idea was influenced by the so-called \\"Zhdanov line\\". The idea was named New Road because it was different from old PKI which was influenced by the Dimitrov line. Musso and Soeripno landed in a swamp in Tulungagung on 10 August. After being picked up, they moved to Solo to meet the military governor Wikana. They arrived in Yogyakarta on 11 August 1948. On 12 August, Merdeka, a newspaper based in Solo, wrote that \\"there was a possibility that Musso, a veteran leader who was very popular, had returned\\". Later, on 13 August, he met Sukarno to discuss a revolution. During a meeting of the PKI Politbiro on 13–14 August, Musso presented the New Road. He denounced the Indonesian revolution as a bourgeois revolution instead of an authentic proletariat revolution. He also demanded more labor representatives in the government and the armed force. Musso also criticized the PKI movement while absent and the use of funds from van der Plas - 25000 gulden by Amir Sjarifudin to fight Japanese army, the resignation of Amir as prime minister without consulting to the party, leader of illegal PKI didn't hasten the formation of legal party after independence, and complexity of the communist organizations which divided into PKI, Pesindo, and SOBSI. Musso, through the Politbiro, announced a merger of the PKI that had a poor leadership with Pesindo and SOBSI which was under the Demokrasi Rakyat Front on 21 August and turned PKI as a mass- based party, though the idea of merger was rejected by Asrarudin and SK Trimurti. Other cadres that refused to merge under PKI were from Pesindo and Barisan Tani Indonesia which was inclined to Sjahrir and from the Murba and Angkatan Komunis Muda (Akoma) which was inclined to Tan Malaka. The merger was officially conducted on 27 August. On 28 August, Musso discussed with Ibnu Parna from Gerakan Revolusi Rakjat (GRR) and Akoma leaders for a possibility both organizations merged with PKI. However, after PKI published its reorganization on 31 August, GRR criticized Musso and PKI. In early September, all leftist parties were merged with PKI. After the reorganization, the new Politbiro was created on 1 September. The new members were younger and more amenable of Musso's idea including D.N. Aidit, M.H. Lukman, Njoto, and Sudisman. To publicize PKI's new course and gain more support, Musso gave speeches and conducted mass meetings. On 3 September, Musso met Barisan Tani in Indonesia, while on the 5th Musso met with students. Starting on 7 September, Musso, Wikana, Setiadjit, and Amir Sjarifudin held mass meetings in Central and East Java, beginning in Solo, Madiun the day after, Kediri on the 11th, Jombang and Bojonegoro on the 13th and 14th, and Cepu and Purwodadi on the 16th and 17th. =Madiun affair and death= In the middle of the month, an incident between PKI-influenced armed forces and government loyalist armed forces occurred in Solo. After this incident, according to Bintang Merah, on 16 September in Cepu, Musso ordered his men in Solo to keep incident from spreading. On 18 September, the crossfire broke up in Madiun. PKI sympathizer stated that the new government called the National Front was formed after killing government loyalist officers and taking over strategic places. Hearing this, Musso, Amir, and the others went to Madiun to control the rebellion. According to the PKI-influenced militia leader Soemarsono, his action was approved by Musso when Soemarsono visited Musso and Amir two days before. However, according to Ann Swift and Himawan Soetanto, Musso did not know about this. On the evening of 19 September, Sukarno ordered his people to choose himself and Hatta over Musso. According to M.C. Ricklefs, Musso had no experience in Indonesia so he had no base of political power over the majority of Indonesian people compared to Sukarno, even local militias that influenced by anti-government side would not support Musso. Responding to this, Musso formed the Nasional Daerah Madiun Front, appointed Soemarsono as military governor and Djoko Soedjono as militia commander. Hatta was dissatisfied with the response, and stated that Musso wanted to take over the government and \\"establish Soviet government.\\" The rebels were pushed after the Siliwangi Division was ordered to attack the PKI force in Madiun. Musso and Amir who knew that they could not successfully resist a Subroto-led attack, instructed the PKI force to try to escape and hide in the mountains. On 28 September, Musso, Amir, and Soemarsono left Madiun for Ngebel and Dungus, Ponorogo. While in Balong, Ponorogo, Musso and Amir had a serious disagreements over tactical plans. While Musso wanted to move to the south Amir preferred moving north. On 31 October, in the mountains near Ponorogo, Musso was killed by government forces while trying to escape. Political view and legacy In the largest sense, Musso was a true Stalinist who thought there could only be one party for the proletariat, a party led by Soviet-supported communists. After returning from Moscow, Musso developed a vision of Jalan Baru untuk Republik Indonesia (The New Road for Indonesian Republik). This vision and the associated plans the direction of the PKI from being largely dominated by the ideas of Dimitrov to Zhdanov. The next PKI leader after Madiun affair, Alimin, disagreed with Musso's vision and supported the idea of the PKI as small party of solid professional revolutioaries with militant cadres throughout all Indonesia. Despite Alimin's vision for the revolutionary struggle in Indonesia, young cadres during the era of Alimin dominance such as those led by Njoto, Aidit, and M.H. Lukman were largely influenced by the ideas of Musso. Sukarno described Musso as \\"jago\\", a rooster pet for fighting because when Sukarno and Musso lived together in Tjokroaminoto's house, Musso \\"liked to fight\\". Ruth T. McVey paired Musso with Alimin as the leaders of revival of the PKI in the 1920s. Soe Hok Gie described Musso as quite similar to Haji Misbach, as someone who \\"liked to run amok\\" and was rather reckless. A statue of Musso is said to be planned to be built in a park in Phnom Penh as a tribute to Musso who visited Phnom Penh in 1931.

The film was photographed by cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, and written by Jerry Cady, Dalton Trumbo, and Nathanael West. Although considered a B movie, the positive notices received by Ball helped launch her as an A-list actress.Ball 1997, p. 92. Five Came Back is considered a precursor of the disaster film genre. In 1948 Five Came Back was remade (differing only in minor details) as the Mexican film Los que volvieron and again in 1956 by producer-director Farrow as Back from Eternity, starring Robert Ryan and Anita Ekberg. Plot Nine passengers board a commercial flight from Los Angeles to Panama City: wealthy Judson Ellis (Patric Knowles) and Alice Melhorne (Wendy Barrie), eloping because their parents disapprove; an elderly couple, Professor Henry Spengler (C. Aubrey Smith) and his wife Martha (Elisabeth Risdon); Tommy Mulvaney (Casey Johnson), the young son of a gangster, and his escort, gunman Pete (Allen Jenkins); Peggy Nolan (Lucille Ball), a woman with a shady past; and Vasquez (Joseph Calleia), an anarchist being extradited and facing a death sentence for killing a high-ranking politician, and his deportation guard, Crimp (John Carradine), who expects a substantial reward for delivering him. The crew comprises pilot Bill (Chester Morris), co-pilot Joe Brooks (Kent Taylor), and steward Larry (Dick Hogan). Chester Morris, John Carradine, Lucille Ball and Joseph Calleia in Five Came Back On their way to Panama, a fierce nighttime storm buffets their airliner, The Silver Queen. A gas cylinder is shaken loose and knocks a door open and little Tommy falls against it; steward Larry attempts to close it and hands Tommy up to one of the other passengers, just before he falls through the open door to his death. An engine fails and the pilots are forced to crash-land in jungle terrain. In the morning the professor recognizes plants of the Amazon rainforest: the aircraft has been blown far south of where rescuers will search; the nearest civilization is across the mountains. But there is water, and enough fruit and game for everyone to live on. Weeks go by while Bill and Joe struggle to repair the damaged airliner, while the others clear a runway and lighten the aircraft by removing all unnecessary weight. The experience changes everyone. The Spenglers rediscover their love for each other. Bill warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells him about her sordid past. Judson falls apart, staying drunk much of the time, while Alice toughens up and begins to feel attracted to Joe. The biggest change is to Vasquez. Seeing how well most of the group have coped with their situation, he reconsiders his radical beliefs. On the 23rd day, Crimp disappears; Tommy eventually discovers his dead body. When Peggy and Pete go looking for Tommy, he leads them to Crimp's body, which has a poison dart stuck in it. Pete orders Peggy to take Tommy to safety while he covers their retreat, but he is quickly killed by unseen natives. The remaining survivors board the now-repaired airliner, but as the engines turn over, an oil leak develops. Bill and Joe patch it, but realize that their repair will fail some time after takeoff, leaving only one running engine. As a result, the aircraft can only carry four adults and Tommy across the mountains. As everyone tries to decide how to choose who must stay behind, Vasquez suddenly grabs a pistol and announces that, since he is doomed no matter what, he is the only one without bias and will make the decision. While the leak repairs are being made, he is approached by Professor Spengler, who says that he and his wife have lived their lives and should stay; then Judson tries to bribe Vasquez by offering to pay for a top lawyer. When the aircraft is ready, Vasquez announces that both pilots and both of the younger women will go along with Tommy. Judson attacks, and Vasquez shoots him dead. The airliner takes off, leaving behind Vasquez and the Spenglers. As the natives approach, Professor Spengler quietly informs Vasquez that they must not be taken alive, as they will be tortured. Vasquez lies to him, telling him that there are three bullets left. He kills the couple with his last two bullets, and then awaits his grisly fate.

The studio bought it on 12 April 1938 and said it would be a \\"probable vehicle\\" for Cary Grant. However, Five Came Back wound up being made as a B picture, albeit a higher budgeted one than normal films of the type. In August 1938 it was announced as part of RKO's schedule for the following year. Victor McLaglen and Charles Coburn were originally announced as cast members. Eventually, John Carradine was borrowed from 20th Century Fox and Allen Jenkins from Warner Bros. C Aubrey Smith and Joseph Calleia were also cast. Lucille Ball, Patric Knowles, and Kent Taylor were last-minute replacements for Ann Sothern, Alan Marshall, and Alan Baxter. =Shooting= Filming started in late March 1939. Although primarily filmed on a back lot, Five Came Back overcame some of the limitations of its low-budget. The fiery director insisted on a realistic jungle environment and had trees imported to flesh out the jungle landscape on the sound stage. Unwanted attention directed toward Lucille Ball by lead actor Chester Morris and clashes between director Farrow, a contract player, and Ball made for a tense set. When two Black Widow spiders dropped out of a tree onto Ball's head, she was extremely upset and left the set, screaming.Brady 2001, p. 88. Capelis XC-12 The transport aircraft used in Five Came Back is the Capelis XC-12, built in 1933 by Capelis Safety Airplane Corporation of California, although an altogether different airplane, a Lockheed Electra, is seen in one takeoff sequence. The aircraft was a 12-seat, low-wing cabin monoplane with two 525 hp Wright Cyclone engines. The Capelis XC-12 featured an unusual construction method with the main wing spar bolted together, and much of the metal skin attached with P-K self-tapping screws rather than rivets. These tended to vibrate loose, requiring tightening or replacing screws every few flights. After a 1938 emergency landing caused structural damage, promotional tours were quickly abandoned. The aircraft was then sold to RKO in 1939. The transport ended its career as a non-flying film prop, appearing in ground roles (in the 1942 Flying Tigers, starring John Wayne, and in other features) before reportedly being scrapped around 1950, after having slowly become a back lot relic. Flying shots in Five Came Back used a XC-12 miniature, due to the aircraft having been permanently grounded by the studio's insurance company.\\"Capelis.\\" Aerofiles, 2007. Retrieved: June 24, 2007. Principal photography was completed on April 26, 1939, coming in at an estimated $225,000.De la Hoz 2007, p. 189. Reception =Critical= In his July 5, 1939, review in The New York Times, Frank Nugent praised Five Came Back as \\"a rousing salute to melodrama, suspenseful as a slow-burning fuse, exciting as a pinwheel, spectacularly explosive as an aerial bomb\\". \\"Out of the enterprise comes a fine piece of work by Joseph Calleia\\", wrote critic Wood Soanes, \\"an actor who was taken from the stage after several excellent characterizations and who has been given little chance to show his stuff on the screen. Because Five Came Back was obviously not viewed as an epic while in the making and was, consequently, not subjected to high-powered studio supervision, Calleia managed to get in a splendid character study\\". Richard B. Jewell, Professor of American Film at the University of Southern California, wrote in The RKO Story, \\"In 1939, John Farrow directed one of the most exciting 'B' films in company history. Since the title indicated how many would make it out alive, audience members were kept on the edge of their seats\\". Jewell describes the film as \\"one of the very best program melodramas in RKO history\\". Five Came Back was also notable for lively \\"street smart\\" dialogue attributed to its team of distinguished screenwriters. Both Cady and West were later to be nominated for Academy Awards in future projects, while Trumbo became one of Hollywood's most acclaimed screenwriters with two Oscars to his credit. =Box office= Even though the studio had planned it as a standard \\"B\\" movie, Five Came Back became a surprise hit that \\"quickly amassed an enthusiastic word-of-mouth campaign among moviegoers\\".Stafford, Jeff. \\"Articles: Five Came Back.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: July 30, 2012. The film, which cost $225,000 to make, eventually earned $262,000 in profits\\".Jewell 1982, p. 131. =Legacy= The film is widely viewed as having paved the way for disaster epics of the '70s, like Airport and Poseidon Adventure. Five Came Back was admired by Buddy De Sylva at Paramount, who later put Farrow under contract and gave him A-picture assignments. Remade in 1956 as Back from Eternity. It is also credited as inspiring the 1967 Star Trek episode The Galileo Seven.https://www.tor.com/2015/06/09/star-trek-the- original-series-rewatch-the-galileo-seven Home media Five Came Back was released on DVD by the Warner Archive Collection in June 2015.

It is located in the state capital, Salem. Constructed from 1936 to 1938 and expanded in 1977, the current building is the third to house the Oregon state government in Salem. The first two capitols in Salem were destroyed by fire, one in 1855 and the other in 1935. New York architects Trowbridge & Livingston conceived the current structure's Art Deco stripped classical design in association with Francis Keally. Much of the interior and exterior is made of marble. The Oregon State Capitol was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 29, 1988. The federal government's Public Works Administration partially financed construction which was completed during the Great Depression in 1938. The building was erected at a cost of $2.5 million for the central portion of the building, which includes a dome of . The wings, which doubled the floor space of the building to about , were added later for $12.5 million. The grounds outside the capitol building contain artwork, fountains, and flora, including the state tree (Douglas fir) and state flower (Oregon grape). Early capitol buildings Before the creation of the Oregon Territory in 1848, the Oregon Country provisional government, through legislation on June 27, 1844, and December 19, 1845, selected Oregon City as Oregon's first capital. J. Quinn Thornton described an early capitol building as 20 by 40 feet with a platform at one end for the president. One of the private buildings this government used was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. Governor Joseph Lane affirmed Oregon City's status as capital by proclamation. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P. Gaines refused to relocate, on the basis that the same act located the university in Corvallis and the penitentiary in Portland; he declared the act unconstitutional, on the grounds that the authority to locate those institutions was his, and the Territorial Supreme Court concurred; the governor and most of the Supreme Court remained in Oregon City. Justice Orville C. Pratt, who had dissented, relocated to Salem; on May 14, 1852 an act of the United States Congress settled the matter in Salem's favor. Corvallis On January 13, 1855, the Oregon Territorial Legislature passed a bill moving the seat of government from Salem to Corvallis. Governor George Law Curry and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were already under construction. Curry sent the matter to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., where Secretary James Guthrie declared the move invalid unless acted on by the United States Congress. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State Benjamin Harding moved back to Salem. On December 3, 1855, the legislature convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation to move the capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, the legislature re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask the people of the territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a runoff. The initial vote set up a runoff between Eugene and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was ignored, and the capital remained in Salem. A permanent resolution of the capital location issue came in 1864. In 1860, the legislature put the question once again to a popular vote. On a vote in 1862, no city received the 50 percent minimum required by law. In an 1864 election, Salem received 79 percent and was declared the state capital. The Oregon Constitution lists the seat of state government in Article XIV as Marion County, of which Salem is the seat. =First capitol= Artist's rendering of the 1855 building The land developed for the permanent capitol buildings was Salem block 84, sold to the state for this purpose by pioneer and Salem founder W. H. Willson. Construction of the first capitol building began in 1854, shortly after Congress confirmed Salem as the capital city. However, with the capital moving to Corvallis the next year, construction was temporarily halted. After the capital's return to Salem, the building was nearly completed by late 1855. This territorial capitol, of Greek Revival- style, stood wide and long (15 by 23 m), with a stone facade and a 10-foot (3 m) portico. Built of native ashlar blocks, the exterior walls, two stories high, ranged in color from a deep sky blue to white. The first floor was tall and the second tall with an eight-foot (2.4 m) entablature. The building was decorated with four Ionic columns on the front (west) end. The building housed a variety of rooms, including a federal courthouse with a chamber measuring 20 by 27 feet (6 by 8 m) and an executive office of 18 by 20 ft (5.5 by 6 m) on the first floor. Also on the first floor was the House chamber, measuring 36 by 46 feet (11 by 14 m) and having three entrances. The first floor also held the main hall, which included an entrance wide. On the second floor was the Senate chamber, 26 by 36 feet (8 by 11 m). Additionally, the Territorial Library was housed in a room that was 20 by 36 feet (6 by 11 m). The second story also had a gallery viewing area for the House, three committee rooms, and several rooms for government clerks. The capitol was designed by Captain Charles Bennet, who participated in the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, and construction supervised by William H. Richter at a total cost of $25,000. Fire On the evening of December 29, 1855, a fire destroyed the first capitol building and many of the territory's public records. Starting in the unfinished northeast corner of the structure, still unoccupied by the government, the fire was not discovered until around 12:30 am. Arson was suspected, but no one was arrested. The site of the burned-out capitol building remained a pile of stones for several years after the fire. A downtown building, Nesmith's Building (later named the Holman Building), served as a temporary capitol from 1859 until 1876. The legislature met on the second and third floors of that building, which also housed the other state offices. =Second capitol= Plans for a new building began to take shape in 1872 when the state legislature appropriated $100,000 ($ as of ) towards a new capitol building. This second capitol, built between 1873 and 1876, was a two-story structure with an additional first level that was partly underground; the total cost was $325,000 ($ as of ). The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 5, 1873, during a ceremony that included a speech by Governor Stephen F. Chadwick and the music of several bands. Construction, on the same site as the 1855 building, was partly accomplished with convict labor from the Oregon State Penitentiary. Architects Justus F. Krumbein and W.G. Gilbert designed the building. Built of stone and five million bricks, Oregon's new capitol measured 275 by 136 feet (84 by 41 m) with a dome of . The ground story was of native Oregon sandstone from the Umpqua region. The structure had a square rotunda on the interior that was tall. Also inside was a Senate chamber measuring 75 by 45 feet (23 by 14 m) and a House chamber of 85 by 75 feet (26 by 23 m). On the top floor was the Oregon Supreme Court with a courtroom measuring 54 by 45 feet (16 by 14 m) and the Oregon State Law Library, 75 by 70 feet (23 by 21 m). Also on the top floor was a viewing gallery for the House. On the exterior were ornamental pilasters and two-story porticos on the east and west ends. The building included a lunch counter. Additionally, the building had mullion-windowed wings. The large copper-clad dome was constructed with an iron and steel framework. This dome rose above the rest of the building and was tall. The building was of Renaissance style with Corinthian columns on the front entrance and was patterned after the United States Capitol. At that time, the capitol faced west toward the Willamette River. The government began using the building in August 1876, before the dome was built. Originally, plans called for towers on both sides of the dome (a tower on both ends of the building with the dome in the middle), but they were left out to save money. Oregon's second capitol building stood from 1876 to 1935. Fire On April 25, 1935, at 6:43 pm, a custodial engineer called the Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove items from the smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started in the basement of the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky. Flames could be seen as far away as Corvallis. One volunteer firefighter, Floyd McMullen, a student at Willamette University, died in the fire, which drew firefighters from as far away as Portland. Salem sent seven fire trucks to the scene; three more came from Portland. Only the outer walls were left standing after the fire was extinguished. Losses were estimated at $1.5 million ($ as of ), and the state did not carry insurance. The losses, which included historic artifacts such as the portraits of all the governors, could have been worse had the state not used fire-proof vaults in the basement to store valuables such as more than $1 million ($ as of ) in stocks and bonds. During the blaze, firefighters poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and prevent the contents from disintegrating. Years earlier, the state had turned over many historical documents to the Oregon Historical Society in Portland for preservation, and those records were preserved. Although the Supreme Court had moved to the Oregon Supreme Court Building in 1914, the two buildings were connected by tunnels used for electricity and heating. At the time of the fire, the Oregon State Library was in the basement and first floor of the Supreme Court Building. Many books in the basement suffered water damage when water used to fight the fire flooded tunnels and seeped into the Supreme Court Building. Offices previously housed in the capitol were moved to other government buildings and to leased space in downtown Salem until a new building was built. =Third capitol= Construction of the newest building began on December 4, 1936. The third state capitol was completed June 18, 1938 and is the fourth-newest capitol in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on October 1, 1938, with speeches from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leslie M. Scott, Robert W. Sawyer, and Oregon Governor Charles Henry Martin. Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition, the design of the new building deviated from the normal design of state capitol buildings. The design was labeled a combination of Egyptian simplicity and Greek refinement. Overall it is Art Deco in style, and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.Esteve, Harry. Capitol scene 2001 Oregon Legislature. The Oregonian, January 8, 2001. Controversy occurred before construction began when Governor Martin suggested the new building be sited on a hill south of downtown (Candalaria Heights) and away from the busy center of town. Another proposal called for the purchase of the Willamette University campus and relocation of the capitol to that site.The Oregon State Capitol: What Could Have Been... Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on October 8, 2007. However, downtown merchants were able to keep the capitol building in downtown at the original location, though some Victorian homes were subsequently leveled to make way for the building. Another early complaint about the structure was that the cupola resembled a \\"paint can\\" rather than traditional domes on other capitols, including the earlier Oregon structures. It was even called a \\"squirrel cage\\", lacking in majesty. Additionally, the public was slow to admire the gold Oregon Pioneer atop the dome. Installation of the statue began on September 17, 1938, and took several days and heavy- duty equipment. The building cost $2.5 million ($ as of ), of which the federal government paid 45 percent through the Public Works Administration. Upon completion, the new capitol was wide, long, and tall (50 by 122 by 51 m) and contained of usable space. The exterior was finished with Vermont marble. The lobby, rotunda, and halls were lined with a polished rose travertine stone quarried in Montana. The rotunda's staircases and floor used Phenix Napoleon Grey Marble quarried in Phenix, Missouri, and had borders of Radio Black marble that, like the exterior stone, is from Vermont. There are 158 names of notable Oregonians inscribed on the walls of the legislative chambers; of these, only six are women. The original cost estimate for the building was $3.5 million ($ as of ), but the state legislature only appropriated $2.5 million; committee rooms were subsequently removed from the plans. These rooms were added in 1977 as part of a $12.5 million ($ as of ) expansion project to add new wings containing legislative offices, hearing rooms, support services, a first floor galleria, and underground parking. This addition doubled the space of the capitol building. In 2002, the wings were remodeled at a cost of $1.3 million ($ as of ) to upgrade items such as antiquated wiring and to install new carpeting and lighting. On March 25, 1993, the magnitude 5.6 Scotts Mills earthquake damaged the dome, requiring closure for repairs. The rotunda area remained closed for approximately two years for these repairs.Esteve, Harry. Converging paths to leadership two adept veterans who mix personal values and political skills will direct the 2005 legislature Peter Courtney political everyman relies on dramatic, affable style. The Oregonian, November 30, 2004. This \\"Spring Break Quake\\" shook the building enough to shift the statue on top and crack the dome. Additionally, the quake created a three-foot (one-meter) bulge on the west end of the building. Repairs cost $4.3 million ($ as of ) and included reinforcing the structure with additional concrete and steel bars. In April 2002, the building became the first state capitol in the United States to produce solar power through the use of 60 photovoltaic panels generating 7.8 kilowatts. One-third of the power is used to light the Oregon Pioneer at night; the remaining electricity is sent into the power grid. On December 31, 2007, the Oregon State Capitol hosted its first authorized wedding between Oregon State Representative Tobias Read and Heidi Eggert. At Read's encouragement, the Legislature created a policy authorizing up to four public events a year. On August 30, 2008, the building caught fire around 12:30 in the morning and was quickly extinguished with damage to the Governor's offices on the second floor on the south side. The governor was forced to relocate some of his offices, including some time at the Oregon State Library across the street. Exterior and interior rotunda The Oregon State Capitol is home to both branches of the state legislature, the House and Senate, and has offices for the governor, treasurer, and the secretary of state. In its center, the floor of the prominent rotunda features an embedded Oregon State Seal sculpted in bronze by Ulric Ellerhusen. Ellerhusen also sculpted the Oregon Pioneer that rests atop the capitol dome's exterior. The dome rises above the state seal. The interior of the dome was painted by Frank H. Schwarz and features 33 stars, symbolizing Oregon's place as the 33rd state to join the Union. Eight medallions are painted near the top of the walls of the rotunda that represent the eight objects in the state seal. Also encircling the interior of the rotunda are four murals depicting moments from Oregon history. One mural depicts Captain Robert Gray's exploration of the Columbia River in 1792, another shows the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and two others portray covered wagons from pioneer times. These four murals were painted by Schwarz and Barry Faulkner. Other murals include the Provisional Government of Oregon's salmon and wheat seal, the Oregon Territory's seal, and depictions of Oregon's industries, all located in the rotunda's wings along the grand staircase. The capitol's galleria area on the first floor includes hearing rooms, display cases, and the visitor information area. Oregon's House chamber floor is covered with a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern incorporates a depiction of the state tree, the Douglas-fir, representative of forestry. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden oak. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use black walnut for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring Chinook salmon and wheat, representative of fishing and agriculture. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in friezes, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On the second floor of the capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (western meadowlark).Oregon Capitol Guide.

One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered Wagon) shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside. The building measures 693 by 259.5 ft (211.2 by 79.1 m). The older main portion of the building is tall, while the newer wings added in 1977 are tall. Inside, the building has approximately of floor area and 3.2 million cubic feet (90,600 cubic meters) of volume. In 1997, the Legislative Assembly established the non-profit Oregon State Capitol Foundation in order to \\"create a living history, enhance the dignity and beauty of the Capitol, and foster cultural and educational opportunities.\\" In 2005, the foundation completed the Walk of the Flags project, a display in Willson Park on the capitol grounds of all 50 flags of the U.S. states. In 2007, the capitol wings closed for a restoration project to upgrade items such as furniture, plumbing, and electrical systems. The $34 million project became an issue in the 2008 Senate campaign between Gordon Smith and Jeff Merkley when Smith used the price of the project in ads attacking Merkley who was the Speaker of the Oregon House when the remodel was approved. Part of the attack involved the cost of new desks for legislators and staff that were manufactured by Oregon prison inmates. Renovations were completed in November 2008. Grounds Walk of Flags on the capitol grounds Aerial view of the Capitol and surrounding area The capitol grounds cover three city blocks and include Willson and Capitol parks. Near the west entrance of the capitol is a replica of Philadelphia's Liberty Bell. This bell is one of 53 full-sized replicas made in France and donated by the United States government to each state. Oregon received its copy on July 4, 1950.A Walking Tour: State of Oregon Capitol Grounds. Published by the Oregon Department of General Services. Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs, including blue spruce, Oregon-grape (the state flower), giant sequoia, coast redwood, Japanese maple, dogwood species, Bradford pear, cherry tree species, English holly, rhododendron, and magnolia tree species. One Douglas-fir tree was grown using a seed that rode aboard Apollo 14 to the Moon in 1971 and was transplanted to the capitol in 1976 from Oregon State University. On the east side of the building is Capitol Park, which includes a bronze equestrian statue by A. Phimister Proctor called The Circuit Rider, statues of Jason Lee (Jason Lee) and John McLoughlin (John McLoughlin) by Gifford Proctor, and portions of the Corinthian columns of the second capitol building. Lee established the Methodist Mission and what would become Willamette University. McLoughlin, of the Hudson's Bay Company, was proclaimed the Father of Oregon. The Circuit Rider was added in 1924 as a monument to early preachers. During the Columbus Day Storm in 1962, this statue was knocked over and damaged but restored in 1963. There is also a memorial to Oregon's recipients of the Medal of Honor, dedicated on September 18, 2004. To the west of the building is Willson Park, named for Salem founder William H. Willson and sited roughly at the center of his former landholdings. From 1853 to 1965 it was a Salem city park. After the park was turned over to the state, Lloyd Bond and Associates were asked to redesign the park. Willson Park has the Waite Fountain, a gazebo built in 1982, and Peter Helzer's sculpture, A Parade of Animals (1991), which was designed as a play structure. Waite Fountain was donated in honor of Oregon businessperson E. M. Waite in 1907 by his wife. The Breyman Fountain, added in 1904 as a memorial to Werner and Eugene Breyman, is at the far west end of the park. It was originally decorated with a statue of a soldier from the Spanish–American War and also served as a lamp post and horse trough. Today the statue holds no water and is sometimes planted with flowers. In 2005, a Walk of Flags feature was added that displays the flags of every state in the Union. In 2009, the nine flags of Oregon's federally recognized Native American tribes were added to the Walk of Flags. Other features on the capitol grounds include Sprague Fountain and the Wall of Water. The Wall of Water is located across Court Street from the main entrance. It was added in 1990 and has 22 nozzles shooting water into the air in a plaza that also has slabs of stone with information about Oregon's history. Added in 1985, the Capitol Beaver Family sculpture represents the state animal. Additional features of the grounds include a peace pole donated by the Society of Prayer for World Peace, a large boulder that once lay along the Oregon Trail, a planter that spells out \\"Oregon\\" using shrubs, and a rose garden maintained by the Salem Rose Society.

He was a federal member of Parliament for the riding of Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle. He ran and won in the 1993, 1997 and 2000 Canadian federal elections with significant majorities under the banner of the Liberal Party of Canada. Although considered a backbencher, he was very active in Parliament, participating in several standing committees including primarily National Defence and Veterans Affairs working to study and improve the poor quality of life for members of the Canadian Forces and their families. He also served as Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of National Defence from 1998 to 2000. Lost nomination in 2004 Although prepared to run in the 2004 federal election, he lost the Liberal party candidate nomination to an unknown at the time, David Smith. This was due to new party nomination rules put in place by Paul Martin that changed the long-standing policy of selecting the incumbent by acclamation, part of the infighting that was present within the party at the time. Many rural party members (who traditionally supported Bertrand) felt disenfranchised by this defeat because of the new party nomination rules which called for 3 polling locations spread out across the riding (Fort-Coulonge, Wakefield and Maniwaki) instead of the traditional 1 neutral polling site for both candidates. They believed this favoured the Maniwaki area party members (most of whom supported Smith) because of the greater concentration in their numbers in conjunction with their polling location.  Attempt to run as a Liberal candidate in the 40th Canadian federal election  An article in The Hill Times indicated that Robert Bertrand wished to run as a Liberal candidate in the upcoming federal election. His original request to run was refused in March 2007 and the nomination was closed, giving the candidacy instead to Cindy Duncan-McMillan in order to \\"meet the party’s target of 33 per cent female candidates\\". On April 4, Bertrand received a call from the current director of the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec, Serge Marcil, telling him that the candidacy was re-opened, however he was given an impossible deadline of one week to collect memberships and present himself as a candidate. Bertrand refused this offer and the nomination went ahead with Duncan-McMillan winning over Ottawa lawyer Richard Mahoney on April 15, 2007. Present He is currently living in Fort- Coulonge with his wife Sandra and operates a small business. He has 3 adult children Chad, Eric and Stephanie. He is a passionate outdoorsman as well.

It was directed by Curtis Bernhardt, produced by William Jacobs from a screenplay by Arthur T. Horman and Dwight Taylor, based on the story The Pentacle by Alfred Neumann and Robert Siodmak. It starred Humphrey Bogart, Alexis Smith, and Sydney Greenstreet. The film is the only pairing of Bogart and Greenstreet where Bogart, rather than Greenstreet, is the villain or corrupt character. There's also a cameo appearance of the Maltese Falcon statue. Plot On the surface, Richard (Humphrey Bogart) and Kathryn Mason (Rose Hobart) appear to be a happily married couple. But on their fifth wedding anniversary, Kathryn accuses Richard of having fallen in love with her younger sister, Evelyn Turner (Alexis Smith), who is visiting them. He does not deny it, but has resigned himself to leaving things as they are, since Kathryn certainly would not give him a divorce. At a party celebrating the couple's anniversary, hosted by family friend and psychologist Dr. Mark Hamilton (Sydney Greenstreet), Evelyn meets with Mark's handsome young colleague, Professor Norman Holdsworth (Charles Drake). On the way home, Kathryn suggests to Evelyn that their mother is lonely, so Evelyn decides to move back home. Distracted by this unwelcome news, Richard crashes their car and suffers a broken leg. Richard then decides to take desperate action. He pretends to require a wheelchair, even after his leg has healed. His puzzled physician, Dr. Grant (Grant Mitchell), diagnoses the problem as psychological, not physical, and suggests exercise, so a car trip to a mountain resort is arranged. At the last minute, Richard contrives to have to stay home for one night and finish some work. Going on ahead, and being concerned with Richard's condition, Kathryn stops by Hamilton's home and asks him to check in on Richard. Resuming her journey, Kathryn comes upon an abandoned parked car, blocking the narrow, deserted mountain road. Unexpectedly, Richard walks threateningly out of the fog. The audience is left to imagine him killing her. Next he pushes her car down a steep slope; it dislodges some logs which crash down and hide it. He returns home in time to set up an alibi by meeting with employees he had summoned. In their presence he twice phones the resort to be told she has not arrived; he then notifies the police that she is missing. However, things happen to make Richard wonder if Kathryn somehow survived. First, the police find a pickpocket in possession of a cameo ring that Richard and Evelyn identify as Kathryn's; the man admits to stealing it from a woman matching Kathryn's description after her disappearance. Then Richard smells Kathryn's perfume in their bedroom, finds her key to a home safe, and opens it: her wedding ring is inside. Mark suggests Richard and Evelyn join him on a fishing vacation to relieve the strain. Mark also invites Holdsworth, who takes the opportunity to ask Evelyn to marry him. She is undecided. When she tells Richard, he believes her hesitation is because of him. He tells her he loves her, and that she must feel the same about him, but she strongly denies it. Later, realizing his mistake, he encourages Holdsworth to try again. Then a pawn shop claim ticket is mailed to Richard, addressed in what appears to be his wife's handwriting. At the pawn shop, he finds Kathryn's locket and her signature in the register, but when he returns with the police, the register is different and there is no locket. Finally, he sees a woman on the street who looks and is dressed like his wife. He follows her to an apartment, only to find that it is vacant, with no one inside. Unable to reconcile these occurrences any longer, Richard returns to the crime scene to see once and for all if Kathryn's body is inside the car. But Hamilton and the police are waiting for him. Kathryn's body had been found and removed long before, and now Richard is arrested. Hamilton reveals that he had been onto Richard since Richard's initial interview with the police. Since Hamilton's suspicion wouldn't be enough to secure a conviction in a court of law, Hamilton and the police worked together to stage the events that made Richard suspect Kathryn was still alive, hoping he would return to look for her body, and thus prove he had known all along what happened to her.

In the meantime Warner Brothers decided to produce another movie on a similar theme, The Two Mrs. Carrolls, also starring Bogart and Smith, along with Barbara Stanwyck. The release of this film was also delayed, and it appeared in 1947. Reception =Box office= According to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,265,000 domestically and $1,442,000 foreign. =Critical response= Bob Porfiero in Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style comments: \\"The film is particularly memorable for the use of the song 'Tango of Love' as leitmotif to indicate the putative reappearance of Kathryn, with the background strings translating the scent of perfume; the opening trucking shot through the rain-soaked night up to the window of the Mason house, which allows the audience to eavesdrop on the dinner party; and the sinister appearance of Bogart as he steps out of the shadows to murder his wife.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"Humphrey Bogart plays a wife murderer in this flawed film noir. Director Curtis Bernhardt leaves the plot with too many artificial devices to be effective ... The only thing that can't be faulted was the earnest performances of Bogie as the tortured killer and the supporting cast of Warner Brothers regulars.\\"Schwartz, Dennis .

She was commanded by Lieutenant James Malcolm Stewart, USNR during the Battle of Okinawa. Service history During World War II, LSM(R)-189 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater and participated in the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto, from 26 March to 3 June 1945. On 29 March 1945 the ship was attacked by several Japanese suicide boats and witnessed the kamikaze attack on . The ship was damaged when struck by a Japanese kamikaze aircraft on 12 April 1945 while on radar picket duty off Okinawa. She, with , rescued survivors from , after witnessing the sinking by Ohka rocket aircraft. Decommissioned on 31 January 1946, she was sold for scrap on 17 February 1948 to the National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, California. LSM(R)-189 was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her actions off Okinawa and one battle star for World War II service. Life Magazine Centerfold  The LSM(R) was heralded in Life Magazine in 1945 with a centerfold picture. \\"Each of these tiny ships had amazing firepower, greater at short range than the combined firepower of two mammoth Iowa class battleships\\", ran the caption. The interim group of 12 LSM(R)s transited the Panama Canal and via San Diego, Honolulu, and the Philippines, headed for battle against Japan in March 1945. Unaware of their destination, the crews were nonetheless well equipped and trained. In a preliminary assault on 26 March 1945, they laid down a rocket barrage at dawn on Kerama Retta, a small cluster of islands off the southwestern shore of Okinawa. Their objective: to allow the Marines to swiftly land and secure the islands and harbor for the protection of hospital, supply and communication ships, and floating drydocks. The early dawn assault surprised the Japanese. The Marines took control with a minimum of casualties and established this haven for damaged ships. Okinawa Radar Picket Line The American plan for defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters on to the Japanese before they could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager-to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 12–26 April, Action Report indicated that: > These ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary > function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible > that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary > duty to seriously effect their ability to perform their primary function due > to damage.

A professor of law and university administrator, Nordenberg served as the seventeenth Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh from 1996 to 2014. Nordenberg served as the Dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law between 1985 and 1993 and other various administrative positions before becoming interim Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh in 1995, a position which became permanent the following year. He became known as Nordy to many Pitt students, who voted to name a recreation center and arcade in the William Pitt Union as Nordy's Place, and is also the namesake of the university's endowed Nordenberg Scholarships and the Nordenberg Hall dormitory on the university's campus. Early life Nordenberg was born in Duluth, Minnesota. Nordenberg's family moved to suburban Pittsburgh when his father was relocated with U.S. Steel. He graduated with honors from North Allegheny High School. He was then educated at Thiel College (BA 1970) and the University of Wisconsin Law School (JD 1973).2007-08 Pitt Basketball Guide, pp. 198-99. At Pitt In 1977, Nordenberg joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law as a visiting professor. He served as Dean of the School of Law from 1985 until 1993 and as Interim Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs from 1993 to 1994. The Pitt Board of Trustees elected him Interim Chancellor in 1995 and a year later, after completing a national search, Chancellor. On June 28, 2013, Nordenberg announced his retirement, to be effective August 2014, but with the intent to stay in Pittsburgh and continue to work at the University of Pittsburgh: =Institutional accomplishments= Chancellor Nordenberg (fourth from left) in full academic regalia during Pitt's graduation commencement exercises in 2007 Nordenberg is credited with initiatives that have improved the university's academic, research and athletic standing, and contributed to the renovation and expansion of the university's physical plant. Between 1995 and 2013, student enrollment at Pitt grew 21%, from 27,002 to 32,781 with over 137,000 degrees conferred, and the average SAT score of the applicants grew 185 points. This change is reflective in the student's accomplishments, as after 1995, Pitt undergraduate students have received four Rhodes Scholarships, five Truman Scholarships, six Marshall Scholarships, seven Udall Scholarships, and 41 Goldwater Scholarships. At the same period, Pitt faculty members have been recognized multiple times as Fulbright Scholars, Boren Scholars, Whitaker International Fellows, National Science Foundation Fellows, Critical Language Scholars, and Humanity in Action Scholars; they received prestigious awards such as the National Medal of Science, the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, the MacArthur Foundation's \\"genius award,\\" the Charles S. Mott Prize in cancer research, and the Andrew Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award for exemplary contributions to humanistic studies During Nordeberg's tenure, Pitt re-established its reputation as a national and world class research university, and its yearly research allocations grew from $230 million in 1995 to $800 million currently. University of Pittsburgh is a member of the Association of American Universities, that consist of the 62 top North American research universities. Pitt is prominent in physical, life and social sciences: along with Johns Hopkins, Washington, Michigan, and Pennsylvania universities it is one of the top five largest recipients of the federal science and engineering research and development support; in comparison, in 1995 Pitt was ranked the 24th in the same list. The federal government also designated the Center for Latin American Studies, the Center for Russian and East European Studies, and the Global Studies Center as National Resource Centers. Despite the Great Recession of 2008 and continuous cuts to the state contribution to the university's budget, Pitt under Nordeberg maintains an AA/positive long-term ratings from Standard & Poor. Its endowment grew from $463 million in 1995 to $2.99 billion in 2013. =Physical plant renovation= The university residence hall opened in 2013 was named in Nordenberg's honor Nordenberg oversaw the renovation of several major Pitt buildings including Alumni Hall and Benedum Hall; the demolition of Pitt Stadium, the original Pennsylvania Hall, and the Mineral Industries Building; the acquisition and repurposing of the University Club and the Concordia Club; and the construction of Bouquet Gardens, the McGowen Institute Laboratory building, the Petersen Events Center, Sennott Square, Biomedical Science Tower 3, the Carrillo Street Steam Plant, the new Pennsylvania Hall, Panther Hall, the Public Safety Building, the Life Science Annex, Darragh Street Apartments, the Petersen Sports Complex, and replacement of the University Place Office Building with Nordenberg Hall. He also oversaw the initiation and completion of a $2 billion capital campaign entitled \\"Building Our Future Together\\". Honors In 1984, Nordenberg received Excellence-in-Teaching Award and in 1985 Chancellor's Distinguished Teaching Award from the University of Pittsburgh. He was named Distinguished Service Professor of Law in 1994. Pitt's Staff Association Council and the University Senate honored Mark Nordenberg and his wife Nikki for their service to the university by installing commemorative bench plaza outside of the Cathedral of Learning In 1997, he was honored as Person of the Year in Education by Vectors, a community service organization in Pittsburgh. He was named Pittsburgher of the Year and Co-Pittsburgher of the Year by Pittsburgh Magazine in 1999 and 2001, respectively. in June 2005, the university's board of trustees announced the establishment of the endowed Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg University Chair position to honor the Chancellor's 10 years of leadership. In December 2007, by resolution of the Pitt Student Government Board, the recreation room on the ground floor of the William Pitt Union was named Nordy's Place in honor of the Chancellor whom the board deemed a student favorite and worthy of the honor. In 2009, Nordenberg was honored with the 2009 Presidential Leadership Award by The Gordie Foundation and Outside the Classroom Award for his role in overseeing Pitt's mission to combat binge drinking. He also serves on the board of directors of UPMC and The Bank of New York Mellon. On October 26, 2012, the Pitt Board of Trustees announced a $10 million scholarship fund and the naming of a new campus residence hall, Nordenberg Hall, in honor Nordenberg, citing his role in transforming Pitt in 17 years leading the school. On February 6, 2014, Nordenberg was presented with the Louis and Barbara Thiel Distinguished Service Award by his alma mater, Thiel College as part of their annual Founders' Day Convocation ceremonies. On February 6, 2014, Nordenberg was awarded the Dapper Dan Dr. Freddie Fu Leadership Award in athletics. On April 8, 2014, Nordenberg, along with former Carnegie Mellon University president Jared Cohon, were named recipients of the Elsie Hilliard HIllman Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in Public Service. On May 9, 2014, Nordenberg and Cohon were awarded the Chairman's award by the Carnegie Science Center of Pittsburgh for leadership in science, technology, and education. On May 12, 2014, the university's Staff Association Council and the University Senate announced it was honoring Nordenberg and his wife Nikki with a pair of commemorative benches that were placed outside the windows of the Chancellor's office in the Cathedral of Learning. Post-chancellorship Nordenberg led a search for his successor in 2014, and the university announced on February 8, 2014, that Patrick D. Gallagher would take over for Nordenberg in August 2014.http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/02/08/Pitt-trustees-name- Patrick-D-Gallagher-as-chancellor-to-succeed-Nordenberg/stories/201402080133 At the close of his service as chancellor, Nordenberg was appointed as the chair the University of Pittsburgh Institute of Politics and was named chancellor emeritus.

Fermi–Walker differentiation In the theory of Lorentzian manifolds, Fermi–Walker differentiation is a generalization of covariant differentiation. In general relativity, Fermi–Walker derivatives of the spacelike vector fields in a frame field, taken with respect to the timelike unit vector field in the frame field, are used to define non-inertial and non-rotating frames, by stipulating that the Fermi–Walker derivatives should vanish. In the special case of inertial frames, the Fermi–Walker derivatives reduce to covariant derivatives. With a (-+++) sign convention, this is defined for a vector field X along a curve \\\\gamma(s): :\\\\frac{D_F X}{d s}=\\\\frac{DX}{d s} - \\\\left(X,\\\\frac{DV}{d s}\\\\right) V + (X,V)\\\\frac{DV}{d s}, where is four-velocity, is the covariant derivative, and ( \\\\cdot , \\\\cdot ) is the scalar product. If :\\\\frac{D_F X}{d s}=0, then the vector field is Fermi–Walker transported along the curve. Vectors perpendicular to the space of four-velocities in Minkowski spacetime, e.g., polarization vectors, under Fermi–Walker transport experience Thomas precession. Using the Fermi derivative, the Bargmann–Michel–Telegdi equation for spin precession of electron in an external electromagnetic field can be written as follows: :\\\\frac{D_Fa^{\\\\tau}}{ds} = 2\\\\mu (F^{\\\\tau \\\\lambda} - u^{\\\\tau} u_{\\\\sigma} F^{\\\\sigma \\\\lambda})a_{\\\\lambda}, where a^{\\\\tau} and \\\\mu are polarization four- vector and magnetic moment, u^{\\\\tau} is four-velocity of electron, a^{\\\\tau}a_{\\\\tau} = -u^{\\\\tau}u_{\\\\tau} = -1, u^{\\\\tau} a_{\\\\tau}=0, and F^{\\\\tau \\\\sigma} is the electromagnetic field strength tensor. The right side describes Larmor precession. Co-moving coordinate systems A coordinate system co- moving with a particle can be defined. If we take the unit vector v^{\\\\mu} as defining an axis in the co-moving coordinate system, then any system transforming with proper time is said to be undergoing Fermi Walker transport.

Burroughs between roughly 1954 and 1958. Material from the word hoard was the basis for Naked Lunch, and the Interzone collection, as well as much of The Soft Machine, and minor parts of Nova Express and The Ticket That Exploded. Central to the \\"Word Hoard\\" was the 200-page \\"Interzone\\" manuscript that Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and Alan Ansen helped organise and type up in Tangier in spring 1957, and which became, with later additions, Naked Lunch in 1959. The Nova Trilogy The Soft Machine, The Ticket That Exploded and Nova Express form a trilogy, sometimes dubbed The Nova Trilogy or The Cut-Up Trilogy. The overlaps between Naked Lunch and The Soft Machine confirm that both drew on the same body of manuscripts, but in the case of the other two volumes it is clear that most of the material did not. In 2014, Grove Press published new, 'Restored' editions, edited by Oliver Harris, which established their complex manuscript and publishing histories.On the \\"word hoard,\\" see especially the introduction to The Soft Machine: the Restored Text (New York: Grove Press, 2014). In The Beat Book from 1974, Burroughs claims that when he edits a novel, about half of the material is cut away and later recycled in the next novel. This explains the phenomenon of the plots and characters fading in and out from the different books. Although Burroughs never used the term himself, The Nova Trilogy was intended by the author as \\"a mythology for the space age.\\" References Category:Novels by William S.

It was written and directed by the American-born, Glasgow resident Annie Griffin, who also wrote and directed Festival. It was the winner of two BAFTA Scotland awards. In January 2006, it was announced that screenwriter Andrew Davies would make a feature film adaptation of The Book Group for Film 4, but the project was never started. Plot The Book Group revolved around the life of American Clare Pettengill (Anne Dudek), who, at the start of the series, had recently arrived in Glasgow, Scotland. She starts up a book club to try to find friends with similar interests. Those whom she encounters are not what she expected; her new group consists of a drug-addled, egotistical postgraduate student (and subsequently his neurotic and ever-worrying brother), an easy-going disabled man who aims to be a writer, three discontented footballers' wives, and a straggler who hides his homosexuality with an obsession for football. All of the members are brought together not so much by the books that they read (if they read the book at all), but by their own longings for companionship, and their ambitions to better their lives. Critical reception Reviewing The Book Group for The Guardian, Gareth McLean stated \\"the acting is as cracking as the script and the production values\\" and described the show as \\"a genuine ensemble drama in which everyone plays a vital part\\".

VPN-1 is a stateful firewall which also filters traffic by inspecting the application layer. It was the first commercially available software firewall to use stateful inspection. Later (1997), Check Point registered U.S. Patent # 5,606,668 on their security technology that, among other features, included stateful inspection. VPN-1 functionality is currently bundled within all the Check Point's perimeter security products. The product, previously known as FireWall-1, is now sold as an integrated firewall and VPN solution.  Platforms  The VPN-1 software is installed on a separate operating system, which provides the protocol stack, file system, process scheduling and other features needed by the product. This is different from most other commercial firewall products like Cisco PIX and Juniper firewalls where the firewall software is part of a proprietary operating system. Although traditionally sold as software only, VPN-1 is also sold in appliance form as Check Point's UTM-1 (starting 2006) and Power-1 appliances. These appliances run the SecurePlatform operating system. As of version R70, VPN-1 supports the following operating systems: * Windows Server 2003 and 2008; * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL); * Check Point SecurePlatform (a Check Point Linux distribution based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, often called SPLAT); * Nokia IPSO; * Check Point Gaia (a Check Point Linux distribution, unifying IPSO and SecurePlatform into a single operating system); * Crossbeam XOS and COS Previous versions of Check Point firewall supported other operating systems including Solaris, HP-UX and AIX. See the table in the Version History section below for details. VPN-1 running on the Nokia platform on IPSO is often called a Nokia Firewall as if it were a different product, but in fact it runs the same VPN-1 software as other platforms. Upon completing the acquisition of Nokia Security Appliance Business in 2009, Checkpoint started the project named Gaia aimed at merging two different operating systems—SecurePlatform and IPSO—into one. This new OS is positioned to finally replace both existing operating systems at some point in the future.Gaia project On April 17, 2012 Check Point announced the general availability of the Gaia operating system as part of the R75.40 release. Features While started as pure firewall and vpn only product, later more features were added. And while they are licensed separately, they have since began to be bundled in default installations of the VPN-1 as well.

The main effect of the absorption of microwaves by most materials is heating; the random motion of the constituent molecules is increased. Non-thermal effects are effects that are not due to the increase of thermal energy of the material. Instead, the microwave energy itself directly couples to energy modes within the molecule or lattice. Non-thermal effects in liquids are almost certainly non-existent,Stuerga, D.; Gaillard, P.

Baum was born in Moschin, Province of Posen; his family moved to Berlin when he was young. After he graduated from secondary school there, he began an apprenticeship as an electrician, which became his profession. By 1926, he was an active member of different left wing and Jewish youth organizations, and from 1931 he became a member of the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD). After the seizure of power by the National Socialists he began, together with his wife Marianne Baum (February 9, 1912 - August 18, 1942) and their friends, Martin and Sala Kochmann, to organize meetings dealing with the threat of Nazism, meeting in the Kochmann drawing room and in the apartments of other members. The circle of friends, most of whom were Jewish, designated Herbert Baum as chairman. Up to 100 youths attended these meetings at various times, engaging in political debates and cultural discussions. The group openly distributed leaflets arguing against National Socialism. In 1940 Baum was rounded up and forced into slave labour at the electromotive works of the Siemens-Schuckertwerke (today Siemens AG). From 1941, he headed a group of Jewish slave labourers at the plant, who, to escape deportation to concentration camps, went into the Berlin underground. On 18 May 1942, the group organised an arson attack on an anticommunist and anti-Semitic propaganda exhibition prepared by Joseph Goebbels at the Berliner Lustgarten. The attack was only partially successful and, within days, a large number of the group's members were arrested and 20 were sentenced to death. Baum and his wife Marianne were arrested on May 22. Herbert Baum was tortured to death in Moabit Prison, dying on June 11, 1942. The Gestapo reported his death as a suicide. His wife, Marianne, was executed in Plötzensee Prison on August 18, 1942. Listing of some of the Baum Group's members with their dates of birth and death; they were all executed in Berlin- Plötzensee on March 4, 1943: Heinz Rotholz (1922–1943), Heinz Birnbaum (1920–1943), Hella Hirsch (1921–1943), Hanni Meyer (1921–1943), Marianne Joachim (1922–1943), Lothar Salinger (1920–1943), Helmut Neumann (1922–1943), Hildegard Löwy and Siegbert Rotholz (1922–1943). There is some disagreement as to the manner of death of at least one of the members. Helmut Neumann was either hanged or decapitated. Legacy There is a plaque in the Weißensee Cemetery in Berlin commemorating the Herbert Baum Group and there is also a street near the cemetery named after him, Herbert-Baum-Straße. In the Berlin Lustgarten a monument designed by Jürgen Raue was erected in 1981 memorializing the 1942 attack. While the East German government, which established these memorials, emphasized Baum's allegiance to Communism, other historians (as well as veterans of the group) have noted his group's multiple political and cultural influences and the significance of the Baum group as an example of Jewish resistance to Nazism.

Unfortunately, due to political decisions only two prototypes of this locomotive were ever built. SP47 was the most modern Polish locomotive in those times, and one of the most modern in Europe. =Prototypes= The design of the locomotive, later code-named SP47, was drawn up in 1972. In 1974 construction started at the Cegielski workshop in Poznań, but, on finishing the first one, the decision was taken to terminate diesel locomotives production in Poland. The reason for this was the danger that Polish locomotives would compete with the Soviet ones; in fact SP47 was by far better than any Soviet locomotive. The second prototype (following a great struggle) was completed in 1977. =Career= Both locomotives were dispatched to Olsztyn, where they worked until their end. The second prototype suffered a serious engine failure a few months after entering service. As a result, in 1991 it was set aside, and in 1998 taken out of service and scrapped in 2001. The first of two prototypes run until a serious engine failure in 1997. SP47-001 is currently (after exterior renovation) exhibited at the Railway Museum in Kościerzyna heritage park.

Smith proclaimed that the candidate’s decision “was a great victory for the America First people.” Willkie had stated during the Wisconsin campaign that any candidate who did not repudiate “America First and Gerald L. K. Smith cannot possibly be elected president.” “I hope,” Smith said in a statement on April 5, 1944, “that the other possibilities within the party have learned by now that the way to make votes is not to attack Gerald Smith and the America First movement.”Associated Press, “Willkie’s Defeat Hailed by Smith Of America First”, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday 6 April 1944, Volume 50, page 1. Harry H. Bennett, of the Ford Motor Company, in a statement on April 9, 1944, repudiated claims that he said had been made by Smith that America First had the support of Henry Ford.Associated Press, “Henry Ford Said Not Backing Gerald Smith”, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Monday 10 April 1944, Volume 50, page 1. General Robert E. Wood, former head of the America First Committee, stated in Chicago on April 16 1944, that there was no connection between the pre-Pearl Harbor organization and the current party led by the Reverend Gerald Smith.Associated Press, \\"America First, Smith Said Not Connected\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Monday 17 April 1944, Volume 50, page 4. On April 29, 1944, Smith released a statement claiming that Governor Dewey was “Willkie’s man”, adding that “true nationalists and American Firsters cannot support Dewey-Roosevelt-Willkie internationalism.”Associated Press, “America Firsters’ Chief Calls Dewey ‘Willkie’s Man”, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 30 April 1944, Volume 50, page 2. 1944 Election =Convention= The America First party nominated Gerald Smith as its candidate for president on July 31, at its first convention, begun July 29, in Detroit, and chose an electoral college slate to support him. Further, the convention nominated Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, already the Republican vice-presidential nominee, as Smith’s running mate. “Bricker, reached by telephone at Columbus, Ohio, said of the Detroit nomination: ‘I know nothing about it. I know no one connected with it. I shall not permit my name to be used in any such connection. I am a candidate for vice-president on the Republican ticket only.’”Associated Press, “Bricker Shrugs Off ‘America First’ Bid”, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 1 August 1944, Volume 50, page 1. =Reaction= At a night press conference in St. Louis on August 1, Gov. Bricker denounced Smith and the America First party, stating, “The act of Smith, in associating my name with his on a spurious ticket without any notice of any kind whatsoever, is the cheapest of demagoguery. I denounce it and shall not have my name used in any such connection.” Six hours earlier, Gov. Dewey, the Republican presidential nominee, charged in Springfield, Illinois, that Smith had made a “sinister effort to smear” Bricker. Smith, said Dewey, “is one of those rabble-rousers who, like Adolf Hitler, makes racial prejudice his stock in trade.” Bricker, who had arrived in St. Louis for a two-day conference of the 26 Republican governors, told reporters that he had paid very little attention to Smith or his movement until last night, “when he associated my name with his at a meeting of some kind that was held in Michigan.” Bricker added, “I hate demagoguery, religious intolerance and racial prejudice. They can destroy our free government, as they have destroyed liberty around the world. I shall fight them as long as I am in public office or as long as I live. “The right of religious worship according to one’s own conscience is protected to every American citizen in the bill of rights. The men and women of our armed forces are fighting and dying to preserve that precious right. We must preserve it here at home.” In Detroit, Smith said that he was “happy and proud” to share a place with Congressman Hamilton Fish of New York on Dewey’s “purge list.” Smith added that Bricker, in “repudiating our sincere desire to mobilize 3,000,000 of our people in his behalf, displays the same weakness he showed when he capitulated unnecessarily to Mr. Dewey in Chicago.”Associated Press, “Bricker Hotly Denounces Act Of Smith Party”, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 2 August 1944, Volume 50, page 2. Ultimately, the vice presidential spot on the America First ticket was taken by former Father Coughlin activist Harry Romer. =Election outcome= The results of the 1944 presidential election were less than encouraging for America First Party members; of the over 47,600,000 presidential votes cast, Smith received a mere 1,780, mostly from the states of Texas and Michigan. This America First Party was renamed the Christian Nationalist Crusade in August 1947.https://www.jta.org/1947/07/31/archive/america-first-party-changes-name- will-propagate-preservation-of-a-christian-america The organization published a monthly periodical named ‘’The Cross and the Flag,’’ from April 1942 until December 1977, after Smith’s death in 1976. Subsequent elections In 1948 the Christian Nationalist Party nominated Smith for President and Harry Romer for vice president;http://time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,779941,00.html according to the website \\"ourcampaigns.com\\" this ticket received just 42 votes nationwide. The campaign platform included a full-scale defense of segregation, as well as opposition to civil rights. In 1952 a rump America First Party nominated Douglas MacArthur for President, and Harry F. Byrd for vice president, without their consent, while the Christian Nationalists nominated MacArthur and crusading anti-Communist California State Senator Jack B. Tenney.http://time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,816859,00.html This election apparently marked the final time that candidates were fielded by the original Smith movement or its offspring. By this time, Smith and others in the party had become devout anti-Communists, and this worked against the organization’s isolationist and non-interventionist ideology. Later parties The name \\"America First Party\\" was used by several later campaigns unconnected to the original party: *Perennial candidate Lar Daly used it in the 1960 presidential campaign, where he received 1,767 write-in votes. *Justice Ralph Forbes of London, Arkansas, ran as the \\"America First Party\\" candidate in the 1996 presidential campaign with anti-abortion movement leader Andy Anderson as his running mate, winning 932 votes.http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1996/summ.htm He had tried unsuccessfully to file as the candidate of his own Freedom Party. Forbes had a reactionary hard- right past, having previously been a campaign manager for David Duke's Populist Party run for the Presidency and had also been an officer in the American Nazi Party. * In 2002 after Pat Buchanan returned to the Republican Party, many of his campaign supporters also left the Reform Party to form the current America First Party, a paleoconservative party headquartered and with ballot access in Mississippi.

Ibiza is in the Pityuses group of the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. The Ibiza rail was a relative of the extant water rail (Rallus aquaticus) and may be derived from it, but was a bit smaller and stouter, had shorter and more robust hind limbs and shorter wings, with probably reduced its flight capability. Consequently, it might have also occurred on neighbouring Formentera, where no possible locations have been surveyed. The extinction of this species was more recent than 16,700 years BC, probably roughly between 5,300 and 4,350 years BC. The latter dates broadly overlap a period of the possible arrival of humans at Ibiza, suggesting a relationship between the two events. The Ibiza rail is somewhat unusual insofar as that most extinct insular rails were completely flightless, whereas the Ibiza rail could still fly if it had to. However, it agrees in this respect with many species of rail still found on other continental islands worldwide, whereas most other forms were on oceanic islands. Nonetheless, as there were no terrestrial predators on Ibiza before the arrival of humans, it is probable that this species would ultimately have evolved to complete flightlessness and probably rather small size, which is a trend that seems to hold true for all species of rail which evolved on small islands without terrestrial predators. The paleoecology of the Pityuses group is peculiar because there were almost no mammals present and thus the trophic web in prehistoric times was more similar to the Hawaiian island of Moloka‘i than to Mallorca in the Baleares (Seguí & Alcover, 1999). While the islands may have provided more freshwater habitat due to better tree cover in the past, the Ibiza rail's habitat was probably brackish swamps in the coastal lowland. Extinction was most probably due to overhunting by the expanding human population. Most other extinct island rails which were unable to escape hunters due to flightlessness, but this species is more likely to have fallen victim to its small population size: Ibiza is not large, and available habitat was densely populated by various species of birds, which would leave little resources for a large population of any particular species. Thus, the Ibiza rail was likely to succumb to an amount of hunting which could have been tolerated by a larger population of island rails, flightless or not.

Frank Wilkinson (August 16, 1914 – January 2, 2006) was an American civil liberties activist who served as Executive Director of the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation and the First Amendment Foundation (both predecessors to the Defending Dissent Foundation).  Biography  Born in Charlevoix, Michigan, Frank was one of four children. In 1917, Frank's father, Dr. Alan Wilkinson, enlisted in the Army Medical Corps and was stationed in Arizona. Dr. Wilkinson was a devout Methodist, so much so that Wilkinson recalled, \\"every morning of my life we had Bible reading and prayers at the breakfast table. It wasn't just saying grace. We got down on our knees and put our heads on the chairs.\\" In 1925 the family moved to Hollywood, California and on to Beverly Hills two years later. Although they weren't rich, the family was comfortable and Frank told his biographer \\"I was not touched by the Depression.\\" First Amendment Felon, pg 29 Wilkinson attended Beverly Hills High School. Frank graduated from University of California, Los Angeles in 1936,Lyman, Rick. \\"Frank Wilkinson, Defiant Figure of Red Scare, Dies at 91\\", The New York Times, January 4, 2006. Accessed January 19, 2008. \\"He attended Beverly Hills High School and then the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 1936.\\" After graduation, Frank traveled in the U.S., North Africa and the Middle East. His desire to see Hull House, a settlement house founded by Jane Addams, the pacifist anarchist head who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931, took him to Chicago. While there, he visited Maxwell Street which he says was \\"one of the real turning points of my life because I had never seen poverty before.\\"First Amendment Felon, pg. 44 He got another glimpse of poverty when he visited the Bowery in New York City and stayed at a flop house. He encountered more poverty and degradation in his travels through North Africa and the Middle East. His experiences there caused him to re- evaluate his faith. He wrote to his friend, U.C. Berkeley President Robert Gordon Sproul: \\"Dear Bob, There is no God...\\"First Amendment Felon, pg 54 But his commitment to humanity and to building a better world was still there, he just had a new perspective on it. = FBI file = When he came home, he informed his family of his new-found atheism and zeal for social reform. The FBI was so interested in his transformation, they opened up a file on him. The first entry notes that he had been seen in the company of \\"known Communists.\\" The FBI continued to monitor Wilkinson's activities for the next four decades. By chance, Wilkinson met Msgr. Thomas O'Dwyer, the Archdiocesan Director of Catholic Charities, who introduced him to slums a few scant miles from his home in Beverly Hills, and recruited him to the Citizens Housing Council, and advocacy group for slum clearance and public housing. From this, it was a logical progression to the staff of the Los Angeles Housing Authority. At the Housing Authority, Frank campaigned for the integration of the first Watts Housing project, he was appointed manager and given the job of implementing the integration he had demanded. As the housing program expanded into a massive $110,000,000 plan for the area, he became the Special Assistant to the Executive Director. Among his new responsibilities was the task of explaining slum clearance and public housing to the general public. This put him in contact with a multitude of groups, ranging from veterans' organizations and Catholic, Jewish and Protestant hierarchies to the many diverse community and political groups, including the Communist Party. = Chavez Ravine = Wilkinson was caught up in the McCarthy Era when he defended a major public housing project, Elysian Park Heights, for the Chávez Ravine section of Los Angeles. Many residents of this area had already been displaced due to the impending construction of a new public housing project to be designed by Richard Neutra. In August, 1952, Frank was assigned by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles to testify as an expert witness in the condemnation proceedings against a group of property owners in the Chavez Ravine, then a predominantly Hispanic and impoverished community. Frank and the housing authority wanted to turn the area into integrated public housing. Frank testified at length on the slum-like conditions in the ravine. Felix McGinnis, a lawyer for the landlords, began his cross examination. He had an FBI dossier on Frank Wilkinson and other Housing Authority employees that had been given to him by LA Police Chief William Parker.First Amendment Felon, pg. 75 He asked: \\"Mr. Wilkinson, will you now tell us of all the organizations, political or otherwise, with which you have associated?\\" Frank divulged a long list of the groups he had joined: religious, civic, his fraternity. When he stopped, he was asked if that was all. He refused to go on, as a \\"matter of personal conscience. And if necessary I would hold that to answer such a question might in some way incriminate me.\\" The court ruled him disqualified as an expert; his testimony was stricken from the record. The Los Angeles City Council passed a resolution deploring his refusal to answer and calling upon the House Un-American Activities Committee to come to L.A. to investigate the Housing Authority. The California Senate's \\"little HUAC\\" (California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities) subpoenaed both Frank and his wife, Jean, a high school social studies teacher, for a closed session. By now it was clear the only purpose was the probe of the political associations of persons related to the Housing Authority. As a matter of personal conscience and social responsibility, Frank and Jean refused to answer. They were both fired immediately. As the investigation of the Housing Authority continued, the program collapsed and Chavez Ravine became Dodger Stadium. = Campaign Against the House Un-American Activities = Wilkinson was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) twice, once in 1956 in Los Angeles, and again in 1958 in Atlanta. Both times he chose to plead the First Amendment (rather than the Fifth). In Atlanta he was joined in pleading the First by Carl Braden, a civil rights activist. They both were cited for contempt of Congress in a vote of 435-0 for Frank and 434-1 for Carl. Their case went all the way up to the Supreme Court (see Wilkinson v. United States). In a 5-4 decision, the court upheld Wilkinson's conviction (they refused to hear Braden's case, so the effect was to uphold his conviction as well). While the case was wending its way through the courts, Wilkinson toured the country speaking out against HUAC and organizing in cities where HUAC held hearings. In 1960, he helped form the National Committee to Abolish HUAC, which evolved into the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation, the organization he led until his death. On May 1, 1961, Frank and Carl Braden entered federal prison. = 132,000 Pages in his FBI File = After his release, Wilkinson continued his work to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee, traveling the country, speaking at campuses and meetings to build opposition to HUAC. During this time he continued to be closely monitored by the FBI. In 1986, with the help of attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, Wilkinson sued for his FBI file. Eventually the FBI was forced to release 132,000 pages of files which included Wilkinson's reports on his speaking engagements and travel, as well as an apparent plot to assassinate him.  Awards  Because of his resistance to political repression, Wilkinson received the Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty; and the American Civil Liberties Union Eason Monroe Courageous Advocate Award, the Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award, and the 1997 National Lawyers’ Guild Legal Worker of the Year. Wilkinson's story was featured in a special edition of Life (magazine) in 1991, celebrating the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights.

It was first developed by Manz et al. in 1995. Usually, a cell that is secreting the protein of interest is isolated using an antibody-antibody complex that coats the cell and is able to \\"catch\\" the secreted molecules. The cell is then detected by another fluorochrome-labelled antibody, and is subsequently extracted using a process called fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). The FACS method is broadly similar to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody format, except that the encapsulated cells remain intact. This is advantageous as the cells are still living after the extraction has taken place. Further advances now mean that it is possible to extract the secreting cells using a magnetic- based separation system or using a flow cytometer. A number of commercial applications exist for secretion assay. One such example is the Gel Microdrop (GMD) technology, developed by One Cell Systems. One Cell asserts that GMD typically recovers a higher number of viable secreting cells than other methods, whilst ignoring any cells which are not secreting the desired protein.

Aerial view of the Financial District in Downtown Toronto Main Street in Chesterton, Indiana Commercial areas in a city are areas, districts, or neighborhoods primarily composed of commercial buildings, such as a downtown, central business district, financial district, \\"Main Street\\", commercial strip, or shopping centers. Commercial activity within cities includes the buying and selling of goods and services in retail businesses, wholesale buying and selling, financial establishments, and a wide variety of uses that are broadly classified as \\"business.\\" While commercial activities typically take up a relatively small amount of land, they are extremely important to a community's economy. They provide employment, facilitate the circulation of money, and often serve many other roles important to the community, such as public gathering and cultural events. A commercial area is real estate intended for use by for-profit businesses, such as office complexes, shopping malls, service stations and restaurants. It may be purchased outright by a developer for future projects or leased through a real estate broker. This type of property falls somewhere between residential and industrial property. Practically every incomer must grant permission to build a new office complex or other profit-making business, the city government must determine that the chosen area is indeed commercial area. The zones which separate commercial, industrial, and residential area are clearly zoned for commercial use, then the city will allow the sale to proceed for the stated use. If any part of the property extends into a residential or industrial zone, however, then the buyer must seek a 'variance', special permission to cross over a zone boundary. A commercial area can be held by real estate agents who treat it the same as residential areas. Signs advertising the availability and size of the real estate can be erected, and arrangements can be made to buy or lease smaller lots. Sellers may also agree to make improvements to the land, such as grading off uneven spots or clearing out unwanted trees. A professional developer may purchase huge swatches of this type of property simply to guarantee its availability for later projects.(WiseGeek, 2012) Zoning laws Cities often use zoning laws to prevent conflicts between residential homeowners and businesses. Land designated as a commercial area is rarely located in the middle of residential zones. City planners encourage businesses to congregate along busier streets and central downtown areas. This helps to keep traffic to these sites manageable. Some areas of the city may be designated for 'mixed usage', which means some commercial areas may be used for residential purposes. A quaint downtown shopping area with apartments would be an example of mixed usage. Commercial areas definition may include industrial usage as well, although zoning laws still regulate the level of industry permitted. Heavier industries often purchase property on the fringes of cities or in unincorporated areas. Some commercial zones in the city do allow for light industrial usage, usually smaller factories with minimal emissions and transportation needs. Some examples of commercial area buildings are: * Arena * Auditorium * Bank * Chain store * Gas station * Grocery store * Hotel * Movie theater * Office * Pharmacy * Restaurant * Shophouse * Shopping mall * Car Dealer * Discount stores * Warehouse clubs Different kinds of commercial areas Commercial area in Visakhapatnam The Neighborhood Commercial 1 (CN1) zone is intended for small sites in or near dense residential neighborhoods. The zone encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for nearby residential areas. Some uses which are not retail or service in nature are also allowed so a variety of uses may locate in existing buildings. Uses are restricted in size to promote a local orientation and to limit adverse impacts on nearby residential areas. Development is intended to be pedestrian-oriented and compatible with the scale of surrounding residential areas. Parking areas are restricted, since their appearance is generally out of character with the surrounding residential development and the desired orientation of the uses. The Neighborhood Commercial 2 (CN2) zone is intended for small commercial sites and areas in or near less dense or developing residential neighborhoods. The emphasis of the zone is on uses which will provide services for the nearby residential areas, and on other uses which are small-scale and have little impact. Uses are limited in intensity to promote their local orientation and to limit adverse impacts on nearby residential areas. Development is expected to be predominantly auto accommodating, except where the site is adjacent to a transit street or in a Pedestrian District. The development standards reflect that the site will generally be surrounded by more spread out residential development. The Office Commercial 1 (CO1) zone is used on small sites in or near residential areas or between residential and commercial areas. The zone is intended to be a low intensity office zone that allows for small-scale offices in or adjacent to residential neighborhoods. The allowed uses are intended to serve nearby neighborhoods and/or have few detrimental impacts on the neighborhood. Development is intended to be of a scale and character similar to nearby residential development to promote compatibility with the surrounding area. Development should be oriented to pedestrians along transit streets and in Pedestrian Districts.Planning and Sustainability Innovation. Collaboration. Practical Solutions.

Leasing commercial areas Leasing commercial office space is one of the largest expenses incurred by new and expanding businesses, so it is important to do your due diligence. Here are some tips for negotiating a commercial lease for your small business. =Lease agreement= Lease term and rent are your first negotiation points. It is generally recommended that small businesses negotiate one- to two-year leases with the option to renew. You will also want to factor in rent increases over the term and renewal options so you are not charged with an unexpected rent increase without warning. Consider working with a broker to help you negotiate with the landlord. It is also important to consult a knowledgeable real estate lawyer; they can often recommend the right choice for you and protect your interests as you negotiate your lease through the broker.Leasing Commercial Space. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government. In commercial leases the expiration date of the lease can be extremely harsh, but through trial and error courts in the United States have created exceptions to relieve some anxieties. Commercial tenants may now use an \\"honest mistake\\" or an \\"inadvertence\\" to disregard the timely renewal of their lease. The non-renewal of the lease can also now result in forfeiture of the property to the tenant.

Alexander Lakier was born in the city of Taganrog in 1825. His father, Boris Lakier, a convert from Judaism, was the doctor who certified the death of the late Russian Emperor Alexander I of Russia who died in Taganrog in 1825. Lakier graduated from the Legal Dept. of the Moscow University and defended his thesis with On Domains and Estates (O Votchinah i Pomestyakh) released in Saint Petersburg in 1848. In 1856-1858, Lakier traveled across Europe, Palestine and the United States of America. He kept a travel diary, fragments of which were published in Sovremennik (1858) and The Russian Messenger (1858) and were later included in the book The Travel Through North American States, Canada and Cuba, which was published in Saint Petersburg in 1859. In 1858, Alexander Lakier entered the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, where he was involved in statistics work and worked as editor in the commission on liberation of peasants. In 1860, he returned to Taganrog, where he worked as lawyer. Alexander Lakier published The History of Russian Sovereigns' Titles (1847), On Service in Russia before Peter The Great Times (Saint Petersburg, 1850), Review of Relations between Russia and England in 16th and 17th Centuries (1854) and other. His most famous work was \\"Russian Heraldry\\" (Saint Petersburg, 1855). This oeuvre is still a valuable reference, where Lakier made an attempt to analyze and explain coats of arms of Russian dukes and nobility.

Unfortunately, the world of contemporary music is so small that at times I cannot help having the impression that I could easily suffocate in it. And, for that matter, I do not seem to be fully accepted in that world.

However, these same speeds were found to be extremely dangerous at GARRA's premier track, the Daytona International Speedway. The concrete walls of the oval section of the road course that the series runs were dangerous enough on their own, but were also on the parts of the track where cars reached their highest speed. Therefore, GARRA decided that they would need to slow down their competitors in order to make their racing series safer. At the same time, due to the technological advancement of Le Mans Prototypes, GARRA decided that they would also lower the overall cost of their prototypes. To do this, they would use closed cockpit chassis made of tube frames, instead of high cost carbon fiber composites. They would also standardize the amount of technology that could go into a car, as well as not allowing teams to develop their cars over a season, instead being forced to stay with the same basic car. This would stop teams from having to spend money on aerodynamic tweaks and technological experimentation, as well as private track testing. To further restrict cost, the series would regulate who could provide chassis and who could provide engines, thus preventing teams from trying a unique chassis or engine that may end up being a failure. Engines specifically would have to be based on a road-legal production unit from a major manufacturer. At the same time, major manufacturers would not be allowed to run Daytona Prototype teams, in order to help keep competition level and costs down. Flying Lizard Motorsports Daytona Prototype at the 2011 24 Hours of Daytona. Combining the low cost elements with the speed and safety elements, the designs for Daytona Prototypes were laid down, with constructors having freedom to develop a car however they wished so long as it fit within the smaller dimensions of a Daytona Prototype over a Le Mans Prototype. These smaller dimensions, especially in length, helped to create a more blunt front end to the car that would slow the cars down, regardless of how much a constructor put into sculpting the design. Chassis Riley MkXI run by Samax Motorsport. Driver Wayne Taylor sitting in the cockpit of his Daytona Prototype. In order to help regulate the field and to help keep it level, GARRA only allows a certain number of chassis to be used. At the same time, each approved chassis is allowed to participate for a period of five years before GARRA reselects their approved chassis. Each chassis fits within GARRA's regulations in regards to dimension, but each approved chassis is uniquely different in design. =DP Gen1 (2003)= From 2003 to 2007 seven manufacturers had their chassis approved by GARRA: * Chase CCE * Crawford DP03 * Doran JE4 * Fabcar FDSC/03 * Multimatic MDP1 (sometimes badged as the Multimatic Ford Focus) * Picchio DP2 * Riley MkXI =DP Gen2 (2008)= For 2008, new chassis designs were allowed to be submitted, with several companies purchasing the rights from existing entries. Lola Racing Cars, in association with Krohn Racing, purchased Multimatic's entry for the construction of a new prototype under the name Proto-Auto. Dallara later purchased Doran's entry as well, with assistance from SunTrust Racing.. Cheever Racing purchased Fabcar's license and developed under the Coyote name, with assistance from former manufacturer Picchio. The new chassis available from 2008 onward were: * Crawford DP08 * Coyote CC/08 * Dallara DP-01 * Proto-Auto Lola B08/70 * Riley MkXX * Sabre RD1 GARRA allows for modifications to the bodywork of each Daytona Prototype only in certain areas, most specifically to the rear wing and Gurney flap as well as front dive planes. =DP Gen3 (2012)= Various changes have been made to the Daytona Prototypes for the 2012 season: *The greenhouse (cockpit) area became nearly identical for all newly constructed cars, but featuring a one-inch zone throughout the greenhouse surface to allow for individual styling cues, including windshield implementation and window outlines. *New minimum body cross-section provisions gave the new DPs a more upright front fascia and nose, rather than the more sloped layout of previous generations cars. This allowed manufacturers to add more design character to their cars, making them closer to their production cars while still offering the dramatic message embodied by a prototype *Flexibility has also been introduced into the rules for side bodywork, including production-derived sidepods and open vents behind the front wheels that enable styling elements from street cars to be functional on the race cars. These changes notwithstanding, the basic chassis structure below the greenhouse remains the same, including suspension details, engine installation, bellhousing, gearbox, electronics, fueling and safety systems. Gen2 cars could be updated to Gen3 specifications. The Gen3 cars are: * Riley MkXXVI * Corvette DP (Corvette bodykit applied either to Riley, Coyote or Dallara chassis) Image:Brumos Fabcar Porsche.jpgFabcar FDSC/03 Porsche Image:Alex Job Crawford.jpgCrawford DP03 Porsche Image:Cheever Racing Coyote Pontiac.JPGCoyote Pontiac Image:Doran Dallara Ford.JPGDallara DP01 Ford Image:Doran JE4.jpgDoran JE4 Ford Image:Krohn Lola Pontiac.JPGLola B08/70 Pontiac Image:AIM Riley Ford.JPGRiley MkXX Ford Engine A Porsche engine installed in a Daytona Prototype. As well as the chassis, the engines used are also standardized and regulated. Unlike chassis, engines must come from a major production car manufacturer, using the block from an engine used on a production car. However, these engines can have their displacements modified in order to equalize the field. For 2007, all engines will also be required to use standardized ECUs in order to better regulate engine performance. The following engines are currently approved by GARRA: * BMW 5.0 L V8 * BMW 4.5L V8 * Ford 5.0 L V8 * Ford 3.5 L Twin Turbo V6 * Infiniti 4.35 L V8 * Lexus 5.0 L V8 (can also be branded as Toyota) * Porsche 3.99 L Flat-6 * Porsche 5.0 L V8 (approved in late 2007) * Pontiac 5.0 L V8 (can also be branded as Chevrolet or Cadillac) * Honda 3.9 L V6 * Honda 3.5 L V6 Each engine also has specific restrictions on what can be modified beyond stock parts, as well as restrictions on intake and exhaust dimensions, RPM, and various technical details. During the 2007 season, a second Porsche engine was approved by Grand Am. The 5.0L V8 unit is not actually constructed by Porsche, but is based on the V8 engine used in the Porsche Cayenne, built by Lozano Bros. Porting.

A second Multimatic-Ford was planned to race, but it never appeared. In qualifying, a Chevrolet Corvette and a Ford Mustang, both from the GTS class, set the fastest two lap times, while the leading Daytona Prototype was the Multimatic-Ford. Grand-Am however reserved \\"the first three rows of the grid for the Daytona Prototypes, regardless of their qualifying times,\\" to ensure the Daytona Prototypes started at the front of the field.911 & Porsche World, March 2003 The Daytona Prototypes also failed to even take the overall pole position from heavily restricted SRP prototypes. In the race itself, only two DPs managed to finish, far behind a much lower Grand Touring class car. However, after the teething problems were worked out, the cars began to take overall victories as the season progressed. For 2004, the SRP cars were finally banned, and the number of DPs grew, with 17 appearing at the season opener at Daytona where they managed to take the overall win. By 2006, thanks to the low cost of the design, the number of DPs at some races grew to above thirty entrants, allowing for full fields and close racing. In 2012, Grand-Am released the next generation Daytona Prototypes. Some of these include the new Corvette Daytona Prototype which also marks Chevrolet's return to the DP class and other manufacturers already in the series changed to multiple chassis designs from the chassis producers. GARRA planned to continue using the Daytona Prototype in the foreseeable future, with new chassis designs being allowed into the series in 2008. When the Rolex Sports Car Series merged with the American Le Mans Series, Daytona Prototypes were being raced alongside the LMP2 prototypes from the ALMS as the main prototype class. Between 2006 and 2012, DP cars were permitted to compete in Japan's Super GT in the secondary GT300 class with outstanding results, one entrant, the Mooncraft Shiden lost out to an RE Amemiya RX-7 (although tied for points) in the drivers' title and again to a MR-S, but took the team title in 2007. = Daytona Prototype International = From 2017 forward, a new generation of Daytona Prototypes, branded Daytona Prototype International (DPi), has been replacing the original tube-framed Daytona Prototypes. These new prototypes will be based on the four ACO homologated LMP2 chassis made by Dallara, Onroak (Ligier), Oreca, and Riley-Multimatic, with brand specific bodywork and homologated engines. Manufacturers are asked to partner with a privateer team, and each car will sport manufacturer bodywork, corresponding to their brand- identity. These rules are made to both control costs and attract manufacturers to the series. Nissan Onroak DPi at Petit Le Mans. These cars compete in the Prototype class, along with ACO-FIA spec LMP2 cars, which feature chassis from the same four manufacturers and a spec Gibson V8 engine. Originally, the hope was for DPi cars to be Le Mans eligible in the LMP2 class, but disagreements between the ACO and IMSA did not allow this to come to fruition. Action Express Racing's Mustang Sampling Racing Cadillac DPi- V.R. at the Petit Le Mans.

An investment banker, an underwriter, or a stock promoter may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.e.g. Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App Cas 1218 An earlier term for such a person is projector.Wiktionary:projector Fiduciary duties Generally, promoters are in a fiduciary relationship with the company and its investors and shareholders, and must avoid conflicts of interests and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter. Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay. A promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public. The fiduciary duties of promoters include: * not to make any secret profit out of the promotion of the company. Secret profit is made by entering into a transaction on their own behalf and then selling the concerned property to the company at a profit, without disclosing the profit to the company or its members. Promoters can make profits in dealings with the company, provided they discloses these profits to the company and its members. * to make full disclosure to the company of all relevant facts, including any profit made by them in transactions with the company. If a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus. A person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement. Types of promoters There are three types of Promoters:- =Occasional promoters= These promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they resume their original profession. For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies. =Entrepreneur promoters= They are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management. =Financial promoters= Some financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment. Functions of promoters The functions of a promoter may include: =Discovery of a business idea= The first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility, financial feasibility, economic feasibility and also incorporation of company. =Detailed investigation= Promoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc. =Assembling the factors of production= If the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company. =Entering into preliminary contracts= The promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts. =Naming a company= The promotor has to select a name of the company while selecting the name the promotor keeps in mind that the name should not be identical to the name of any other company.

It is bounded on the east by Pine Street, on the north by Auburn Street, on the west by Willow Street, and on the south by Valley Street, from which it derives its name. It came into existence in 1840, when the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company donated of land in downtown Manchester to the city for the purpose of creating a public burial ground. In 1841, the city created the Valley Street Cemetery. It was designed as a \\"garden cemetery\\", meant to be a place where the public could stroll along its walkways, carriage paths and bridges. In this Victorian Era, \\"garden cemeteries\\", in which not only the dead resided, but the living communed with each other and with nature, were popular. By the late 1850s, the cemetery was nearly filled, and the much larger Pine Grove Cemetery was created. That cemetery lies to the west of Calef Road and to the east of the Merrimack River. The scenic stream valley that roughly bisects the cemetery. A receiving tomb was built at Valley Cemetery in 1888, used to store the deceased during winter when the ground was frozen. In 1907, Mrs. Hannah Currier donated gates at Auburn and Chestnut Streets in honor of her late husband, New Hampshire Governor Moody Currier. A chapel in the English Gothic style was completed in 1932, replacing a wooden chapel that stood at the same site. The stone structure is now in bad repair and has been closed for many years. There are 13 private mausoleums in the cemetery. Prominent burials Many of the city's leaders have been buried at Valley Cemetery, including: *Manchester mayors Jacob F. James, Warren L. Lane, Alonzo Smith, David A. Bunton, Darwin J. Daniels, Joseph B. Clark, David B. Varney and William C. Clarke *Governor Frederick Smyth (1819–1899), whose imposing tomb is one of the jewels of the cemetery *Governor Moody Currier (1806–1898) *Congressman Ira Allen Eastman (1809–1881) *Senator Daniel Clark (1809–1891) *Abolitionist campaigner Rev. Andrew Foss *Aretas Blood (1816–1897), owner of the Amoskeag Locomotive Works, and his wife Lavinia Kendall Blood, founder of the Manchester Women's Aid and Relief Society in 1875 *Gov. Ezekiel A. Straw (1819–1882), an engineer for the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company who laid out the street grid for the city of Manchester *Brigadier general Joseph Carter Abbott, a Union veteran of the American Civil War who remained in the American South following the war and was active in local politics there. He was elected as the Republican Governor of North Carolina. Restoration efforts By the end of the 20th century, the cemetery was recognized by many to be in serious decline, and its heritage as a garden cemetery had long since been forgotten by most. In 2002, the interest of Education Continuum at Southern New Hampshire University spurred the creation of Friends of the Valley Cemetery, a non-profit community organization dedicated to raising funds for the cemetery and overseeing its restoration. The group has partnered with city officials to coordinate maintenance efforts and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants for future restoration. A master plan has been written that will guide future restoration of the cemetery. The Currier Gate was restored in 2004. Since 2003, Friends of the Valley Cemetery has hosted an annual strawberry festival in the cemetery, emphasizing its previous heritage as a \\"garden cemetery\\" that exists to be enjoyed by residents.

She was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (Govan, Scotland), with the keel being laid down on 15 September 1924. She was launched on 30 March 1926 and commissioned 12 July 1927. History HMS Berwick, underway off the Norwegian coast, water crashing over her bows When completed Berwick was sent to the China Station, where she remained until a temporary detachment to the Mediterranean in 1936. Along with the rest of her Kent class sub-group of ships, Berwick underwent reconstruction between 1937 and 1938, where her single 4-inch guns were replaced with double mounts, numerous light machine guns were added, and probably most important; a cemented thick and deep armoured belt was added to both sides of her hull beginning at the armoured deck down past her water line. After this work, she completed her sea trials and then proceeded west where she served on the America and West Indies Station with the 8th Cruiser Squadron, based at the HM Dockyard Bermuda, until 1939. When the Second World War started, she served on ocean convoy escort duties, then formed part of Force \\"F\\" (with ) when hunting groups were formed to find German raiders. She did not make contact with any raider, but intercepted the mercantile blockade runners Wolfsburg and Uruguay in the Denmark Straits during March 1940. On 9 April 1940 she participated in the Norwegian Campaign and on 10 May 1940 in the Invasion of Iceland. She was then allocated to Force \\"H\\" at Gibraltar arriving on 7 November. On 27 November, while taking part of Operation Collar, Berwick was hit by a single 203 mm (8 in) shell from an Italian heavy cruiser, either or , which knocked out her \\"Y\\" turret and killed seven men. A second round that struck her some minutes later destroyed the after electric switchboard, leaving the cruiser's aft section without power.O'Hara, Vincent P.: Struggle for the Middle Sea, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 2009, pp. 70-71. . Some sources credit the second hit to a Trento-class Italian cruiser, either Trieste or Trento, the only Italian heavy cruisers within range at the time of the impact.O'Hara, Vincent P.: Struggle for the Middle Sea, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 2009. . On 25 December 1940, Berwick engaged the German heavy cruiser off the Canaries when she formed part of the escort to convoy WS-5A, a troop convoy to the Middle East. Despite being thoroughly ready for combat Berwick got the worst of the encounter. She scored no hits on Admiral Hipper, and sustained a fair amount of damage, being hit by several 8-inch (which for the most part passed right through the ship) and 4.1-inch shells. The action did however, drive off Admiral Hipper, and saved the convoy from any losses. Four of her complement were killed and she had to return to Britain for repairs, which lasted until June 1941. When repaired Berwick joined the Home Fleet and for the remainder of her wartime career she was escorting convoys to North Russia and operating in the northern North Sea, where she served under the captaincy of Norman Vere Grace from January to August 1944. In late October 1944 the ship carried Free Norwegian Forces from Britain to Murmansk, so that they could participate in the Liberation of Finnmark.Simon Orchard, \\"THE EVACUATION OF FINNMARK & THE RE-ENTRY OF NORWEGIAN FORCES INTO NORWAY, OCT 1944-MAY 1945.\\" She escorted two carrier raids against the in 1944 and again in 1945. Berwicks last role was to escort carriers that were raiding the Norwegian coast in 1945.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The facility has served the city of Louisville and Jefferson County in a variety of ways during the past century, from utilization as an actual armory to American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels basketball games, to various wrestling events, concerts, political rallies, and Hurricane Katrina flood relief have also been staged there. More recently, WWE used the 3,000-person capacity arena as a training ground for future stars in a minor-league promotion known as Ohio Valley Wrestling, until the organization moved to the Davis Arena. WWE also staged two pay-per-view events while the venue was known as Louisville Gardens: (In Your House 6 and In Your House 17: Ground Zero). TNA Wrestling held an event at the venue in 2007.

Additionally, the Ohio Valley Conference men's basketball tournament was held there from 1949 to 1955 and again from 1964 to 1967. The Kentucky Colonels, of the American Basketball Association, played their home games at the facility, then known as the Louisville Convention Center, from 1967 through 1970. Louie Dampier was the team's best player in the era. On November 24, 1968, Penny Ann Early became the first female to appear in a men's professional league, playing briefly in a home game for the Colonels. The Louisville Catbirds, of the Continental Basketball Association (1983–1985), the Louisville Shooters, of the Global Basketball Association (1991–1992) and the Kentucky Colonels, of the ABA 2000 (2004–2006), all played their home basketball games at the Louisville Gardens. The University of Louisville women's basketball team used the Gardens for six home games in the 1997–98 season. Ice hockey teams to use the Gardens as home ice include the Louisville Blades and the Louisville Shooting Stars.

While this idea does not propose to end the sovereign existence of either nation through reunification, it is aimed to resolve the conflicts afflicting the Indian subcontinent since the partition of India in 1947. Background The partitioning of India formally came into effect on 14 August 1947, dividing the provinces of Bengal (with East Pakistan, now Bangladesh) and Punjab (with West Pakistan, now Pakistan proper) to create a separate nation (from India) as outlined by the Pakistan Movement, which advocated the \\"Two- Nation Theory\\" — that Muslims and Hindus cannot sustain a nation together because of religious differences that would prove too difficult to compromise on or, in some cases, simply impossible to reach a mutual consensus on.Two- nation theory The partition provoked great communal conflicts and shortly afterwards, a major dispute over the territory of Kashmir (a former princely state under the British Raj which was sovereignly claimed in full by both the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan) sparked a large-scale war between the two neighbouring countries. India and Pakistan have, since their independence, engaged in four armed conflicts against each other (1947, 1965, 1971, 1999), all of them stemming from their disputes in Kashmir with the exception of the war in 1971. However, some diplomatic efforts have succeeded in promoting bilateral trade and sports events between the two nations as well as permitting Indians and Pakistanis to peacefully cross the border and visit through services provided by the Samjhauta Express and the Delhi-Lahore binational bus route. The 1972 Shimla Agreement and subsequent bilateral accords have bound both nations to seek a peaceful solution to the Kashmir conflict while promoting trade and economic cooperation. Confederation Some politicians and academicians in India and Pakistan have promoted the concept of a confederation between the two republics as a means to resolve their conflicts while promoting common cultural bonds, economic development and solidarity in major issues, with a ceremonial head of state and important posts held alternately by Indians and Pakistanis. Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Sheikh Abdullah supported the idea. In 1972, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, explored the possibility of a Pakistan-India Confederation and asked \\"the Government-owned Pakistan Times to write in favour of India-Pakistan confederation.\\" Some advocates of the concept perceive the two-nation theory to have been a failure, being unable to resolve conflicts between Muslims and Hindus, and that a closer bonding of the two nations would be the best possible solution and bring about a greater possibility of peace, prosperity and progress in the region.Advani moots Indo- Pak confederation According to some advocates, such an arrangement would not only end the Kashmir conflict and bring about peace, but would forge a powerful geopolitical entity of equal standing with various global powers such as the United States, European Union, Russia and China. As a result of a confederation between Pakistan and India, M. V. Kamath said that instead of spending exorbitant amounts of money on defense, the Indo-Pakistani Confederation would have funds \\"available for constructive activities like health, education and economic infrastructure.\\" Kamath appealed to the Hindu–Muslim unity demonstrated in the War of Indian Independence in 1857 as support for an Indo-Pakistani Confederation. The Indo-Pakistani Confederation, according to Kamath, would have a common currency and a common Parliament. Former Vice President of India Mohammad Hamid Ansari called for an Indo- Pakistani Confederation that would be \\"based on the principle of equality\\" and in which \\"India, Pakistan and Bangladesh should remain separate, and yet together on issues of common concern and common benefit.\\" According to Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal and former Pakistani Prime Minister Ismail Ibrahim Chundrigar, the Lahore Resolution originally called for a Hindustan- Pakistan Confederation in a United India, not for Pakistan as a separate state from the rest of India. Chundrigar \\"said that the object of the Lahore Resolution was not to create Ulsters (a reference to the violent separatist movement aimed at Northern Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom), not to 'destroy the unity of India', but to get the 'two nations (Pakistan and Hindustan)... welded into united India on the basis of equality'. Harry Hodson, the Reforms Commissioner in India in 1941, said that leaders of the All-India Muslim League \\"interpreted Pakistan as consistent with a confederation\\". Asghar Ali Engineer envisaged a broader confederation between the members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - akin to the European Union.Asghar Ali Engineer - IISCSSS Dinanath Mishra supported such a confederation, and believed that along with India, \\"Countries like Afghanistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka may be willing to start the process this decade itself\\". Pakistani Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, advocated an Indo-Pakistani Confederation that would govern the state of Jammu and Kashmir, \\"taking responsibility for defence, currency and foreign affairs\\". Critics have described the proposal as naïve and impractical given the extent of mutual distrust and antagonism between India and Pakistan after decades of consistent fighting and skirmishes.Some leaders of the South Asian region has started talks about the practicality of this idea. Some advocate that the nations be sovereign but they can issue the same currency and also sign an accord with which they can solve defense related problems with other powerful entities of the world like The U.S.A, Russia and China. More of the Indian population has shown some positivity to this idea, though feelings remain sharply polarized overall.Rediff Reactions The idea of a confederation gained prominence with the endorsement of senior Indian political leader and then-Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, who on April 29, 2004, said in an interview to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, that he envisaged both nations coming together to form a confederation: \\"I conceive that there would be a time when decades hence, both the countries would feel that partition has not solved matters. Why not come together and form some form of confederation or something like that.\\"Indian ExpressAdvani's remarks on Indo-Pak union a 'mirage' Another senior Indian politician, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had similarly advocated the idea. This public endorsement from Advani, a prominent Hindu leader, gave rise to much speculation and media coverage, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pakistan responded by calling the idea a \\"mirage,\\" stating that both nations were sovereign in their own right and this status was in their view \\"irreversible.\\" On the other hand, Pakistani leader Altaf Hussain who founded the Muttahida Qaumi Movement has had a favourable stance towards an India-Pakistan confederation, saying that such a confederation would \\"set another example like the European Union.\\" Some leaders throughout other nations of South Asia have discussed the practicality of this idea. Some advocates added ideas such as the two nations retaining their sovereignty but issuing and dealing in the same currency and also signing an accord with which they can resolve problems related to defence with world powers like the United States, European Union and Russia. Some Pakistani commentators have argued that Indian leaders specifically rejected the notion of such a confederation during the early years of the Cold War, when Pakistan attempted to covertly contact India to outline the possibility of Indo- Pakistani defence cooperation in Kashmir against growing Chinese ambitions in the region, which was rejected by India with the reasoning that the entirety of Kashmir is an integral part of India alone which shuts down the question of any Pakistani presence in the region. Others have contended that two nations did not necessarily imply two states, and the fact that Bangladesh did not merge with India despite the cultural similarities (especially with Indian Bengal) after separating from Pakistan supports the initial two-nation theory professed by the Pakistan Movement.

The prophetic books of the 18th-century English poet and artist William Blake are a series of lengthy, interrelated poetic works drawing upon Blake's own personal mythology. They have been described as forming \\"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\\".Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D. Collected Works of Northrop Frye. 2006, pp 11–12. While Blake worked as a commercial illustrator, these books were ones that he produced, with his own engravings, as an extended and largely private project. Overview In these works, concluding with the epic Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion, he elaborated a personal invented mythology (mythopoeia). The mythopoeia is largely Biblical in inspiration; apart from that, it has been extensively debated for both its political and religious content. While The French Revolution from 1791 is not illustrated and is usually excluded from the list of prophetic books, David V. Erdman contends that the separation of this work from the corpus removes a key to the symbolism used by Blake.Blake: Prophet Against Empire (third edition 1977), p. 165. Another work, Vala, or The Four Zoas (1797), begun while Blake was residing in Felpham, was abandoned in draft form; of this abandoning by Blake, Northrop Frye has commented that \\"[a]nyone who cares about poetry or painting must see in [Valas] unfinished state a major cultural disaster\\".Frye, Northrop, Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake, 1969, p. 269. =Critical reception= The prophetic books have on occasion been dismissed as lacking in good sense. This position is now rarely held by scholars of English literature, Blake having been one of the major beneficiaries of critical fashion during the twentieth century. Northrop Frye and, following him, Harold Bloom have suggested that the difficulty of reading Blake's prophetic works can be overcome, and that the dismissive \\"mystical\\" tag applied to them is largely an obfuscation. \\"Mystical\\" as to the poetic language has been indeed the equivalent of \\"visionary\\" applied to the engravings. Blake's prophetic books, having often been dismissed until recent times, have had a tortuous publication history, unlike his lyric poems, which have been regarded as more direct and relatively unproblematic. The continental prophecies The cycle of continental prophecies comprises America a Prophecy (1793), Europe a Prophecy (1794) and The Song of Los (1795), which is made up of sections Africa and Asia. America a Prophecy is divided into a Preludium (which is part of the Orc myth) and A Prophecy, which has obvious political content devolving from the American Revolution. The first line of A Prophecy is repeated as the final line of Africa. On the other hand, Europe a Prophecy has an unnamed introductory section, a Preludium with Orc and Enitharmon, and A Prophecy with connections to the contemporary situation of wartime Europe. The Asia section of The Song of Los links onto the end of Europe a Prophecy (via the word \\"howl\\").

After surviving the assassination of her immediate family, she became a nun. She later helped to lead a rebellion by a group of the nuns, which became a scandal throughout the region. This event was chronicled by the bishop and saint, Gregory of Tours, who was one of the bishops chosen to settle the matter. Life =Early life= In 580, an epidemic of dysentery swept through Gaul and afflicted the king as well as killing all his remaining children, except Basina and her brothers Clovis and Merovech (who later married Brunhilda). Fredegund, Chilperic's third wife, tried to remove the impediment to her own children's succession by sending Clovis to Berny, where the epidemic was strong. This failed to kill him and she had him assassinated along with his mother, the repudiated Audovera. For her own safety, Basina, was sent to the Abbey of the Holy Cross at Poitiers, The abbey had been founded by Radegund, an enslaved Thuringian princess who later became the wife of Clotaire I (Basina's paternal grandfather). The childless Radegund had left her husband to pursue a religious life, enjoying ecclesiastic support. =Monastic rebellion= In 589, Basina joined her first cousin, Clotilda, daughter of Charibert I, in rebellion against the abbess of their monastery, Leubovère, whom they accused of both excessive rigor with the monastic community and immorality. On Palm Sunday of that year, Clotilda led a secession by a group of renegade nuns who left the abbey and took refuge in the Great Church of St. Hilary, where they proceeded to garner a following of men, mostly criminals. She ordered them to abduct the abbess. Forcing their way into the abbey, the rebel nuns' thugs went to the abbey church where the crippled abbess had taken refuge. They first mistakenly seized, however, the prioress of the abbey, Justina, who happened to be the niece of Gregory of Tours. Eventually realizing their error, they returned to the abbey where they successfully seized Leubovère. The kidnapped abbess was imprisoned under Basina's watch and the thugs recruited by the rebel nuns began to ransack the abbey. The bishop of the city was so outraged by this sequence of events that he threatened to cancel all services for the Holy Week celebration unless Leubovère was released. Eventually she was helped to escape her captivity by one Flavian. When Clotilda became too arrogant for her cousin's liking, Basina made peace with Leubovère. Things did not return to normal with this, however. Violence continued to break out in the abbey church itself, and, in Gregory's words, scarcely a day passed without a murder, or an hour without a quarrel, or a moment without tears. This caused King Childebert II of Austrasia to propose to his uncle, Guntram of Burgundy, that they send joint embassies of their bishops to deal with the incident in accordance with Church law. Gregory, Bishop of Tours, the chronicler, was ordered to go, along with Ebregisel, Bishop of Cologne; Maroveus, Bishop of Poitiers; and Gundegisel, Bishop of Bordeaux, to the commotion, but Gregory demanded that Macco, the Count of Poitou, quell it with the arm of the law first. The secular answer being inadequate, the bishops gathered in Poitiers and pronounced a judgement which reinstated the abbess and declared her innocent of any crimes of which the rebels had accused her. The cousins were excommunicated. =Later life= In 590, both Clotilda and Basina were pardoned by King Childebert, and Basina returned to her monastery and lived there, until her death, in obedience. Clotilda, on the other hand, was granted lands by the king's mother, Queen Brunhilda, where she ruled until her death.

The presidential memorials in the United States honor the various Presidents of the United States and seek to perpetuate their legacies. Living and physical elements A presidential memorial may have a physical element which consists of a monument or a statue within a monument. Its entire presence consists of a physical structure that is a permanent remembrance of the president it represents. Most well known presidential memorials such as the Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson memorials have a physical element. There are also official presidential memorials that have a living element with only a minor physical presence. An example of a presidential living memorial is the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Located in a wing of the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., the Wilson Center has a small exhibit concerning President Wilson's life and work, but it is best known for its work to unite the world of ideas with the world of policy by supporting scholarship linked to issues of contemporary importance. In this way the living memorial perpetuates President Wilson's legacy of scholarship linked closely to international relations. Similarly, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship honors U.S. college students dedicated to public service and policy leadership, and thus may be considered a memorial with solely a living element. The Truman Scholarship is the sole federal memorial allowed to honor President Truman. This can also be accomplished through the establishment of a policy institute, like the Eisenhower Institute whose mandate is to advance Eisenhower's intellectual and leadership legacies through research, public education, and public policy recommendations.Eisenhower Memorial The James Madison Memorial Building, the third and newest building of the Library of Congress, is an example of a memorial with both living and physical elements. The building houses a memorial hall to President James Madison, but is also dedicated in memory of his 1783 proposal that the Continental Congress form an official library. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts also has both a physical element, a striking building in Washington, DC, and a living element, an ongoing series of live theatrical performances, presented in the name of a fallen president.

Early life Goldie was born in Auckland on 20 October 1870. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Charles Frederick Partington, who built the landmark Auckland windmill. His father, David Goldie, was a prominent timber merchant and politician, and a strict Primitive Methodist who resigned as Mayor of Auckland rather than toast the visiting Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York with alcohol. His mother, Maria Partington, was an amateur artist and encouraged his artistic ability. Goldie was educated at Auckland Grammar School, and while still at school won several prizes from the Auckland Society of Arts and the New Zealand Art Students' Association. Art education Goldie studied art part-time under Louis John Steele, after leaving school to work in his father's business. A former Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey, was impressed by two of Goldie's still-life paintings that were being exhibited at the Auckland Academy of Art (Steele's art society, of which Goldie was honorary secretary) in 1891, and he talked David Goldie into permitting his son to undertake further art training abroad. Goldie went to Paris to study at the famous Académie Julian. Ian Chilvers, The Oxford Dictionary of Art, p.299 where Goldie received a strong grounding in drawing and painting. Artistic career Portrait of C. F. Goldie in his studio with Patara Te Tuhi, attributed Alfred Hill, ca. 1905-1910, from mounted silver gelatin print, SLNSW PXE 1402He returned to New Zealand in 1898 and established the \\"French Academy of Art\\" with Louis J. Steele, who had been his tutor prior to his departure. They shared a studio and collaborated on the large painting The Arrival of the Māoris in New Zealand,http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pdfs/vol7no5_pdf-version.pdf based on Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa. It depicting exhausted, starved and stormtossed Polynesian mariners sighting land after a long journey by catamaran. Its representation of a starving crew and fanciful canoe was disdained by contemporary Māori.wwwnc.cdc.gov, Pdf However, its artistic merits were praised at the time and is said to have launched Goldie's career. Goldie and Steele parted ways not long afterwards and Goldie established his own studio, Steele apparently resenting the attention accorded to his former pupil. From 1901 he made field trips to meet, sketch and photograph Māori people in their own locations, and he also paid Māori visitors to Auckland to sit for him. Most of these were chiefs visiting the Native Land Court. Steele trod a path established by Steele's Maori history paintings and portraits of tattooed chiefs. Also influential was his brother William, who in 1901 wrote an article that contradicted predictions of the demise of the Maori and later the journalist and historian James Cowan. By far the majority of Goldie's subjects were elderly, tattooed Māori of considerable standing in their own society. (The practice of tattooing (Tā moko) was no longer current at the time, and the remaining examples were mostly elderly; it was also a practice largely confined to high-status individuals.) Goldie dedicated his life to painting the Maori chiefs, Maori leaders and their communities who also became his friends. He lived with them on their various marae and spoke fluent Maori. He wanted to preserve the heritage of the Maori people, whom he admired. Some critics was the fine detail in is paintings as evidence that he painted from photographs, which he did not. An oil portrait of Ina Te Papatahi by Goldie (1902). On 31 October 1920 Goldie traveled to Sydney, where on 18 November at the age of 50 he married 35-year-old Olive Ethelwyn Cooper, an Australian by birth but a resident of Auckland. They did not have any children. Goldie's health eventually deteriorated through lead poisoning (from the lead white used to prepare his canvases). In order to create the finest of detail in his paintings, he would lick the end of his paint brush to ensure an even finer tip. This was a relatively common practice at that time. He produced little work in the 1920s. Encouraged by the Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe, Goldie resumed painting around 1930; in 1934 and 1935 he exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and in 1935, 1938 and 1939; the Salon of the Société des artistes français. He stopped painting in 1941 and died on 11 July 1947 aged 76. =Known sitters= Goldie was Auckland based and his subjects were mainly those from the tribes in the upper North Island. *Wiripine Ninia of Ngati Awa Te Aho-o-te-Rangi Wharepu of Ngati Mahuta (1905) *Te Aho te Rangi Wharepu of Ngati Mahuta *Ina Te Papatahi (also known as Ena) of Nga Puhi *Harata Rewiri Tarapata of Nga Puhi =Honours= In 1935, Goldie was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Soon after, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to art in New Zealand in the 1935 King's Birthday and Silver Jubilee Honours. Legacy Goldie's work is associated with the contemporary belief that the Māori were a \\"dying race\\". Many Māori value his images of their ancestors highly. On the rare occasions they are offered for sale they fetch high prices, among the highest for New Zealand paintings. Goldie is considered among the most important New Zealand artists, and the prices fetched reflect this view. In 2016 The International Art Gallery sold Goldie's last great artwork. The 1941 oil portrait of Wharekauri Tahuna was the first painting in New Zealand history to break the $1 million mark, reaching a top price of $1.175 million.http://radionz.co.nz/300828 In March 2008, NZ$400,000 (NZ$454,000 including buyer's premium) was paid at an International Art Centre auction in Auckland for the painting \\"Hori Pokai - Sleep, 'tis a gentle thing.

This is the most paid for a painting at auction in New Zealand.

The aquarium opened a new permanent building on 1 June 2012. The smaller temporary building located on the waterfront promenade had previously operated as a feasibility trial beginning in 2004 and ran seasonally until 2011. It exhibits marine plant and animal life (invertebrates and fishes) native to the west coast of Vancouver Island. The aquarium fosters an \\"up close and personal\\" visitor experience through their educational approach, which encourages active participation with staff and volunteers in learning about the marine life on display. Displays All of the specimens in the exhibits, with the exception of freshwater juvenile salmon, are collected from the nearby Pacific Ocean, specifically from Barkley Sound and Clayoquot Sound, and are seasonally released back into the ocean. This part of Vancouver Island harbours a wide variety of habitats and species because of its varied geography and exposure to the open ocean. Most specimens are collected either by scuba divers, by hand at low tide, or by hand seining beaches, whereby specific target animals are removed from the net and the rest are returned to the water. Other specimens are occasionally donated by local fisher folk who can access deep or offshore habitats. The feature display animal is the Giant Pacific Octopus, which at this northern latitude ranges to near the surface. Other animals central to the displays are various rockfish species, crabs, bivalves, feather duster worms, bay pipefish, sea anemones, and the sea pen. Interesting species sometimes displayed include the spotted ratfish, Humboldt squid, basket star, spot prawn, and red octopus. In addition, because the aquarium continuously pumps raw sea water through its exhibits, planktonic larvae of all sorts settle out in the exhibits, providing an ever-changing challenge of interesting discoveries. Of particular abundance are the opalescent nudibranch and sand-dwelling shellfish species like clam larvae, which grow into juvenile clams over the summer and are then returned to the beach. Permanent building After operating the temporary facility to evaluate the feasibility of the project (the \\"Mini-Aquarium\\"), enough support was garnered to justify the construction of a permanent aquarium in a nearby location overlooking Ucluelet Harbor, which opened its doors on 1 June 2012. Groundbreaking for the new aquarium was on 29 June 2011. The government of Canada provided $270,500 investment through the Western Diversification Program, and the West Coast Community Adjustment Program contributed $250,000 towards the project. The permanent facility enriches the existing intertidal beach habitat by feeding several tidepools with outflowing seawater from the building, which will increase the diversity of life in the immediate area and provide more living habitats for visitors to explore in the publicly accessible beach area. The building incorporates the latest in sustainable green technology and showcases this to visitors so that they can leave with a greater understanding of how to achieve energy efficiency in their own homes.

It is a followup to the 1985 Commando. It was followed by Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3 in 2008, a downloadable game. Gameplay Screenshot The arcade version of the game had up to three players available for play. The players are members of a covert mercenary team known as the \\"Wolf Force\\". The team is composed of Joseph Gibson (Player 1 in blue), Howard Powell (Player 2 in red), and Thomas Clarke (Player 3 in yellow). Their objective is to rescue a former President from rebels in the fictional African country of Zutula, which is administered by an apartheid government. The game has six levels, plus the final level where the objective is to rescue the president from the Hercules Transport. The controls consist of an eight-directional joystick and two buttons: a Normal Attack and the Megacrush Attack. The player character has a vitality gauge which will gradually deplete as they take damage from enemies, however First-Aid Kits can be picked up that will restore part of the player's energy, as well as power-ups that increases their maximum vitality. The player can upgrade their default gun into an Assault Rifle, a Shotgun, a Grenade Launcher, or a Flamethrower. The Megacrush button will detonate a bomb that kills all on-screen enemies. However, the Megacrush Attack has limited uses which the player can only replenish by picking more Megacrush bombs. In certain stages, the player can pilot enemy vehicles. Ports A Mega Drive version of Mercs was produced by Sega, which was first released in Japan on September 27, 1991, with subsequent releases in North America and Europe. The Mega Drive version features two different game modes: an \\"Arcade Mode\\", which features the same plot and stages as the arcade version, as well as an \\"Original Mode\\" that introduces a new plot with all new stages. One notable aspect which distinguish the Original Mode from the Arcade Mode is the addition of Weapon Shops through the game in which the player can buy power- ups for their character using currency obtained from defeated enemy soldiers, as well as the option to switch between multiple playable characters, each characterized by the weapon they wield (with the starting character using the standard Assault Rifle). Unlike the arcade version, the Mega Drive version of Mercs only allows for a single player, a point which MegaTech magazine considered the game's only weakness. Home computer ports of Mercs were also released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1991 by U.S. Gold. These conversions of the game were handled by Tiertex.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Mercs on their May 1, 1990 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Aliens and Final Fight. Legacy The original arcade version of Mercs, along with Commando and Gun.Smoke, are included in the fourth volume of the Capcom Generations compilations released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1998. The same version of the game would later be included as part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1, released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2005, and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded for the PlayStation Portable in 2006. The Genesis version was released for the Wii Virtual Console by Sega in North America on February 9, 2009 and by Capcom in Europe on February 20, 2009 at a cost of 800 Wii Points.https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/xEzg9EmKxrvklt3OVu_Wit0IrKxzncQchttps://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Virtual- Console-Wii-/Wolf-of-the-Battlefield-MERCS-280141.html This re-release is listed under the title of Mercs: Wolf of the Battlefield, to tie in with the earlier Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3.Coming Soon to a Virtual Console near you...

Approaches to New Orleans, Department of the Gulf Map Number 5, February 14, 1863Official atlas: plate XC. The capture of New Orleans (April 25 – May 1, 1862) during the American Civil War was a turning point in the war, which precipitated the capture of the Mississippi River. Having fought past Forts Jackson and St. Philip, the Union was unopposed in its capture of the city itself, which was spared the destruction suffered by many other Southern cities. However, the controversial and confrontational administration of the city by its U.S. Army military governor caused lasting resentment. This capture of the largest Confederate city was a major turning point and an incident of international importance. Background The history of New Orleans contrasts significantly with the histories of other cities that became part of the Confederate States of America. Because it was founded by the French and owned by Spain for a time, New Orleans had a more cosmopolitan culture and diverse population. Only 13 percent of the 1810 population was Anglo-American. The census population of that time was made up of mostly French speaking refugees from the Haitian Revolution, the French and Indian War, and French and Spanish Creoles along with some smuggled slaves. New Orleans also benefited more by the Industrial Revolution, international trade, and geographical position. Its position by the mouth of the Mississippi River, which drained an important part of the United States, made New Orleans one of the most significant transportation centers in the early United States before the establishment of railroad and road systems. Of particular significance were the inventions of the steamboat and the cotton gin. Before the steamboat, keelboat men bringing cargo downriver would break up their boats for lumber in New Orleans and travel overland back to Ohio or Illinois to repeat the process. Steamboats had enough power to move upstream against the current of the Mississippi, making two-way trade possible between New Orleans and the cities in the interior river network. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, which greatly expanded international trade, and the development of the cotton gin, cotton became a valuable export product, adding to the volume of cargo moved through the city. =Jacksonian democracy and manifest destiny= A formative event in the early history of New Orleans was the Battle of New Orleans. This battle, fought during the War of 1812, enhanced the political career of Andrew Jackson, who, along with Martin Van Buren, in turn founded the Democratic Party. Jackson began a new political movement now known as the Jacksonian democracy. This new direction in American politics had a profound influence on the development of New Orleans and the American Southwest. One of these developments was the construction of Fort Jackson, Louisiana, a star fort suggested by and named after Jackson. This fortress was intended to support Fort St. Philip and bar the Mississippi Delta from invasion.Howe, pp. 8–73, 329–66. The presidents of the Jacksonian democracy supported the concept of manifest destiny, greatly expanding acquisition of territory in the American Southwest and the support of international trade along with the spread of slavery. This powerful political movement also produced sectional tension between the northern and southern halves of the United States, resulting in the creation of the Whig Party to oppose the new Democratic Party. As the political rivalry between the Jacksonian Democrats and the Whigs intensified, the Republican Party was founded, to counter the spread of slavery into states produced by territorial conquests of the Jacksonian Democrats. The victory of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican presidential candidate, in the election of 1860, resulted in the secession crisis and the American Civil War. =The jewel in the mouth of the Mississippi= The Pelican Flag used as a Louisiana militia rally symbol from 1860 to early 1861. This is a later \\"Federal\\" version.Hearn, pp. 11. By the year 1860, the City of New Orleans was in a position of unprecedented economic, military, and political power. The Mexican–American War, along with the annexation of Texas, had made New Orleans even more of a springboard for expansion. The California Gold Rush contributed another share to local wealth. The electrical telegraph arrived in New Orleans in 1848, and the completion of the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad from New Orleans to Canton, a distance of over , added another dimension to local transportation. The combination of all these factors resulted in an increase in the price of prime field hands of 21 per cent in 1848, and further increases as the value of trade grew through the 1850s. By 1860 New Orleans was one of the greatest ports in the world, with 33 different steamship lines and trade worth 500 million dollars passing through the city. As far as population, the city not only outnumbered any other city in the South, it was larger than the four next-largest Southern cities combined, with an estimated population of 168,675.Howe, pp. 671–700. War and battle Major General Mansfield Lovell, CSA, would not surrender the city. The election of Lincoln in 1860 inspired one of the most ardent secessionists in Louisiana, its governor, Thomas Overton Moore, who had taken office on January 23, 1860. Governor Moore interdicted an effort to make New Orleans a “free city”, or neutral area in the conflict. A solid Democrat, Moore organized an effective and discreet movement that voted Louisiana out of the Union in a secession convention that represented only 5 per cent of the citizens of Louisiana. Moore also ordered the Louisiana militia to seize the Federal arsenal at Baton Rouge, and the Federal forts (Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip that blocked approach upriver to New Orleans, Fort Pike that guarded the entrance to Lake Pontchartrain, the New Orleans Barracks south of the city, and Fort Macomb, which guarded the Chef Menteur Pass). These military moves were ordered on January 8, 1861, before the secession convention. With military companies forming all over Louisiana, the convention itself was anti-climactic, voting Louisiana out of the Union 113 to 17. The outbreak of hostilities in the area of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, led to the story of New Orleans in the Civil War.Hearn, pp. 2–11. Farragut's flagship, , forces its way past Fort Jackson. The Union's strategy was devised by Winfield Scott, whose \\"Anaconda Plan\\" called for the division of the Confederacy by seizing control of the Mississippi River. One of the first steps in such operations was the imposition of the Union blockade. After the blockade was established, a Confederate naval counterattack attempted to drive off the Union navy, resulting in the Battle of the Head of Passes. The Union countermove was to enter the mouth of the Mississippi River, ascend to New Orleans and capture the city, closing off the mouth of the Mississippi to Confederate shipping both from the Gulf and from Mississippi River ports still used by Confederate vessels. In mid-January 1862, Flag Officer David G. Farragut had undertaken this enterprise with his West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The way was soon open except the water passage past the two masonry forts held by Confederate artillery, Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, which were above the Head of Passes approximately downriver below New Orleans. From April 18 to 28, Farragut bombarded and then fought his way past these forts in the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, managing to get thirteen of his fleet's ships upriver on April 24. Historian John D. Winters in The Civil War in Louisiana (1963) noted that with few exceptions the Confederate fleet at New Orleans had \\"made a sorry showing. Self- destruction, lack of co-operation, cowardice of untrained officers, and the murderous fire of the Federal gunboats reduced the fleet to a demoralized shambles.\\"John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , pp. 94–95 Historian Allan Nevins argues the Confederate defenses were defective: :Confederate leaders had made a tardy, ill-coordinated effort to muster at the river barrier. Fortunately for the Union, both the naval and military auxiliaries were weak. In all their work of defense the Southerners had been hampered by poverty, disorganization, lack of skilled engineers and craftsmen, friction between State authorities and Richmond, and want of foresight.Allan Nevins: Ordeal of the Union: War Becomes Revolution, 1862–1863(1960) p. 99. =The enemy at the dock= Flag Officer David G. Farragut who commanded the Union fleet that broke through to New Orleans. Major General Mansfield Lovell, Commander of Department 1, Louisiana, was left with one tenable option after the Union Navy broke through the Confederate ring of fortifications and defense vessels guarding the lower Mississippi: evacuation. The inner ring of fortifications at Chalmette was only intended to resist ground troops; few of the gun batteries were aimed toward the river. Most of the artillery, ammunition, troops, and vessels in the area were committed to the Jackson/St. Phillips position. Once this defense was breached, there remained to face Union troops and warships only three thousand militiamen with sundry military supplies and armed with shotguns. The city itself was a poor position to defend against a hostile fleet. With high water outside the levees, Union ships were elevated above the city and able to fire down into the streets and buildings below. Besides the ever-present danger of weather-caused breaks in the levees, now an even greater threat to New Orleans was the ability of the Union military to cause a break in a major levee that would lead to flooding most of the city, possibly destroying it within a day.Hearn, p. 237. Lovell loaded his troops and supplies aboard the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railroad and sent them to Camp Moore, north. All artillery and munitions were sent to Vicksburg. Lovell then sent a last message to the War Department in Richmond, “The enemy has passed the forts. It is too late to send any guns here; they had better go to Vicksburg.” Military stores, ships, and warehouses were then burned. Anything considered useful to the Union, including thousands of bales of cotton, were thrown into the river.Hearn, pp. 238–9. The Louisiana state flag is removed from City Hall Despite the complete vulnerability of the city, the citizens along with military and civil authorities remained defiant. At 2:00 p.m. on April 25, Admiral Farragut sent Captain Bailey, First Division Commander from the , to accept the surrender of the city. Armed mobs within the city defied the Union officers and marines sent to city hall. General Lovell and Mayor Monroe refused to surrender the city. William B. Mumford pulled down a Union flag raised over the former U.S. mint by marines of the and the mob destroyed it. Farragut did not destroy the city in response, but moved upriver to subdue fortifications north of the city. On April 29, Farragut and 250 marines from the removed the Louisiana State flag from the City Hall.Hearn, pp. 243–5. By May 2, US Secretary of State William H. Seward declared New Orleans \\"recovered\\" and \\"mails are allowed to pass\\". Occupation and pacification Major General Benjamin Franklin Butler, Military Governor of New Orleans under Union occupation Statue of Andrew Jackson in New Orleans, Louisiana. At high resolution, Butler's inscription can be observed. =The rise of a political general= On May 1, 1862, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler, with an army of 5,000 men, occupied the city of New Orleans without resistance. Butler was a former Democratic party official, lawyer, and state legislator. General Butler was one of the first Major Generals of Volunteers of the Civil War appointed by Abraham Lincoln. He had gained glory as a Massachusetts state militia general who had anticipated the war and carefully prepared his six militia regiments for the conflict. At the start of hostilities he immediately marched to the relief of Washington, D.C., and despite a lack of orders had occupied and restored order to Baltimore, Maryland. As a reward Butler was made commander of Fortress Monroe, on the Virginia Peninsula. There he gained further political renown as the first to practice confiscation of fugitive slaves as contraband of war. This practice was made a later policy of war by Congress. Due to these and other astute political maneuvers, Butler had been chosen to command the army expedition to New Orleans. Because of his lack of military experience and military success, many were happy to see him go. =Balance between military power and political support= Butler was one of the most controversial and volatile personalities of the Civil War. He was infamous in New Orleans for his confrontational proclamations and corruption. If these things were all he was capable of, he could never have held the city, or prevented Confederate forces from re-capturing it. The impression had been created by Confederate officials and sympathizersHearn, When the Devil came down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans, Louisiana State University Press 1997, , pp. 104–7. that New Orleans and Louisiana were held by brute military force and terror. Butler was in fact a political general, awarded his position by excellent political connections and accomplishments. It was his political expertise that made his position in New Orleans tenable. He in no way had the military force necessary to hold it by force alone. His total military command numbered 15,000 troops. He was never sent reinforcements during the time he commanded in Louisiana. As Butler himself put it, \\"We were 2,500 men in a city... of 150,000 inhabitants, all hostile, bitter, defiant, explosive, standing literally in a magazine, a spark only needed for destruction.\\" His methods of preserving order were radical and totalitarian, even in the North and Europe, with the issue of Butler's General Order No. 28.\\" The United States War Department under Edwin M. Stanton expected Butler to hold eastern Louisiana and the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans, maintain communications up river to Vicksburg, and support Farragut's forces for the siege of Vicksburg. In addition, the city of New Orleans itself was just as indefensible for the Union as for the Confederates. Surrounded by a fragile network of levees and lower in elevation than anything else around it, New Orleans was extremely vulnerable to flooding, bombardment, and insurrection, and was generally unhealthy and subject to devastating epidemics. Defense of the city against attacks from Confederate forces depended on an extensive outer ring of fortifications requiring a garrison of thousands of troops. As a conquered territory, Louisiana had a potential for becoming a serious logistical drain on Union forces, and an unsustainable front if contested by well-organized resistance movements. It was popularly assumed that the Confederacy would launch a major counteroffensive to retake New Orleans. As the largest population center of the Confederacy, and commanding formidable industrial and shipping resources, its permanent loss would be politically intolerable to the Confederacy.Hearn, When the Devil came down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans, pp. 1–5. =Building a political power base in New Orleans= The most valuable asset Butler commanded in New Orleans was not his army but his formidable political heritage. Butler was a Jacksonian Democrat in all senses, and a populist and reformer. He had a great gift for identifying with the issues of the broadest levels of the voters, and turning them to his political advantage. Here the Jacksonian political legacy had come full circle in 47 years, from defending New Orleans from the British, to securing it from secession. Butler's inscription on the base of Jackson’s statue, “The Union Must and Shall be Preserved,” was symbolic of his political identity. The inscription echoed Andrew Jackson's 1830 toast in response to a speech endorsing \\"nullification,\\" during what was called the Nullification Crisis. Jackson stated, \\"Our Federal Union! It must be preserved!\\" That statement defined Jackson's position against any threat to the Union. p. 28 The spoils system created by the Democratic Party was also part of Butler's political heritage. Butler believed the advantages of political office should be used to the advantage of friends and supporters, and to suppress political opponents. In general, Butler used these political abilities to play the various factions and interests in New Orleans, as a virtuoso conductor would inspire an orchestra, to ensure his control and reward Union supporters while isolating and marginalizing hostile pro-confederate factions.Marshall, p. 24. =The poorer classes as the key to the city= Butler began his rule of martial law in New Orleans by sentencing anyone calling for cheers for Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate Major General P. G. T. Beauregard to three months hard labor at Fort Jackson. He also issued order number 25, which distributed captured Confederate food supplies of beef and sugar in the city to the poor and starving. The Union Blockade and the King Cotton embargo had done damage to the port economy, leaving many without work. The value of goods passing through New Orleans had gone from $500 million to $52 million during the period 1860 to 1862.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, p. 41. Butler raised three regiments of infantry, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Louisiana Native Guards, the Corps D'Afrique, from existing free black militia units which were supervised by Gen. Daniel Ullmann. These black units were unusual in having black officers. They served both to add to his forces and to confront the former ruling classes of the city with the bayonets of their former slaves. Butler also used his commercial contacts in the northeast and Washington to revive commerce in the city, exporting 17,000 bales of cotton to the northeast and re-establishing international trade. He employed many local citizens in logistics support of the Union military and in cleaning up the city, including an expansion of the existing city sewer system and setting up pumps to empty the system into the river. This policy helped free the city from the anticipated summer yellow fever epidemic, possibly saving thousands of lives. He extensively taxed the wealthy of the city to set up social programs for the lower classes. These \\"Robin Hood\\" aspects of his programs provided a broad base of political support, an extensive informal intelligence and counter-espionage organization, and provided law and order.Hearn, When the Devil came down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans, pp. 3–4.Marshall, p. 28. Soldiers of the Louisiana Native Guard Regiments raised by Butler in New Orleans =The impact of the occupation on slaves and slavery= Butler had already done the institution of slavery in the Confederacy considerable damage by instituting his \\"contraband of war\\" policy while commanding Fort Monroe on the Virginia peninsula. This policy rationalized the retention of slaves fleeing the seceding states by claiming that the Confederate military was using slave labor for military use in the construction of fortifications, moving military supplies, and constructing roads and railroad grades of use to the Confederate army. Slaves within areas of Confederate control rapidly spread the word that Union military forces were not enforcing the fugitive slave laws, and that slaves could find refuge within Union military lines and employment as laborers for the Union armies. As a result, the use of slaves in the proximity of Union forces became extremely difficult and expensive, since these slaves would flee at first opportunity to Union lines, depriving the Confederate armies of their labor and their former masters of what they regarded as their valuable property. Since the Confederate government was counting on slave labor to offset the greater numbers of Union soldiers, Butler's innovative policy struck the Confederacy at a strategic level, destroying an asset counted on to win the military struggle for independence.McCurry, pp. 253–60, 271–3. The flight of the slaves in the direction of the Union also diverted the resources of the Confederate military and its government in defense of the plantations and the discipline of their labor forces. The planters of Louisiana even appealed for aid from Union authorities, to quote one of them, \\"Our family has owned negroes for generations… we have no one but yourself and Genls Shepley and Butler to protect us against these negroes in a state of insurrection.\\" The plantations of Jefferson Davis, located in the state of Mississippi on Davis Bend downriver from Vicksburg, were also disrupted by the Union invasion. After Davis' older brother Joseph fled the area with some of the slaves in May 1862, the rest revolted, took possession of the property, and betrayed the location of valuables to Union forces and resisted any efforts by Confederate forces to recapture the area. The slaves in rebellion armed themselves with guns and newspapers, and fought to the death any attempts to infringe upon their newfound freedom. This rebellion within a rebellion began to erode Confederate authority within Louisiana the instant Butler's troops appeared in New Orleans and, as a political fifth column, was invaluable to his occupation. =The moment of truth, the Confederate counterstroke= The expected rebel counteroffensive came on August 5 in the form of a naval and army assault on Baton Rouge, led by Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, resulting in the Battle of Baton Rouge. After a hard-fought battle, the Confederate forces were driven out of the city, and both Confederate and Union forces withdrew after the battle. The significant aspect of the battle was that it did not result in a popular uprising, nor widespread support for Confederate forces in Louisiana. As a result, Rebel forces were not able to mount a sustained campaign to retake New Orleans or the rest of the state. This can be considered a tribute to the Union consensus building wrought by Butler's political manipulation and broad-based political support. Chester G. Hearn summed up the basis of this support: “The huge, illiterate majority – the poorer classes of blacks and whites – would have starved had Butler not fed and employed them, and thousands may have died had his sanitation policies not cleansed the city of disease.”Hearn, When the Devil came down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans, p. 4. =Reputation vs. results= Butler's generally abrasive style and heavy handed actions, however, caught up with him. Many of his acts gave great offense, such as the seizure of $800,000 that had been deposited in the office of the Dutch consul and his imprisonment of the French champagne magnate Charles Heidsieck. Most notorious was Butler's General Order No. 28 of May 15, issued after many provocations and displays of contempt by women in New Orleans. It stated that if any woman insulted or showed contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States, she would be regarded and shall be held liable to be treated as a \\"woman of the town plying her avocation,\\" a prostitute. The order provoked protests both in the North, the South and abroad, particularly in Britain and France, and many considered it the cause of his removal from command of the Department of the Gulf on December 17, 1862. He was also nicknamed \\"Beast Butler\\" and \\"Spoons\\" for his alleged habit of pilfering the silverware of Southern homes in which he stayed. He became so reviled in the city that merchants began selling chamber pots with his likeness at the bottom. General Nathaniel P. Banks On June 7, he executed one William B. Mumford, who had torn down a US flag placed by Farragut on the New Orleans Mint. For the execution, Butler was denounced in December 1862 by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in General Order 111 as a felon deserving capital punishment, who, if captured, should be reserved for execution. Butler's administration did have benefits to the city, which was kept both orderly and healthy. The Butler occupation was probably best summed up by Admiral Farragut, who stated, \\"They may say what they please about General Butler, but he was the right man in the right place in New Orleans.\\" Aftermath On December 14, 1862, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks arrived to take command of the Department of the Gulf. Butler was not made aware of the change until Banks arrived to tell him. Contrary to common belief, Butler's inflammatory reign had little to do with his replacement. Political considerations in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio tipped the balance. The Democratic victories in Illinois and Ohio on November 4 had alarmed the Lincoln administration, and a dramatic letter from Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton claimed that the states along the Ohio had more in common with the southern states than with New England, and would leave the Union if the Mississippi were not reopened to trade. Those new considerations reinforced the idea by Secretary of State William H. Seward, one of Butler's political opponents, that an invasion of Texas would be favorably received by a pro- union group of German American cotton farmers living there. The idea was championed by Banks, a New England political general eager to send cotton to mills in the Northeast. Banks undertook the siege of Port Hudson and, after its successful conclusion, began the Red River Campaign in pursuit of Texan cotton. The Red River expedition proved to be a costly failure and resulted in more wanton destruction and looting than the Butler occupation. See also *New Orleans in the American Civil War *H. L.

The book profiles contradictions and hypocritical behaviors of several famous individuals in the United States who are liberals. People profiled in the book include Ted Kennedy, Nancy Pelosi, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ralph Nader, Al Franken, Cornel West, Michael Moore, George Soros, Noam Chomsky, Barbra Streisand and Gloria Steinem. Schweizer contends that many liberals publicly promote liberal values regarding the environment, affirmative action, racism, sexism and finance, but practice the opposite in their private and professional lives. Summary Notable issues that Schweizer addresses in the work are Noam Chomsky's acceptance of money from prominent institutions whose policies he opposes (such as the Pentagon), living in an expensive home, and his visitation of socialist states such as Cuba. Chomsky considers himself an anarchist, not a liberal. Schweizer, in the rest of the work, makes similarly- toned accusations against individuals the book focuses on, particularly surrounding political issues such as environmentalism, labor, and taxation. After the book's publication, Chomsky talked to Schweizer about his creation of a trust fund for his daughters and grandchildren.Schweizer, Peter. \\"Noam Chomsky \\". National Post. March 21, 2006. In Schweizer's follow up discussion with Chomsky, Schweizer reveals that even though Chomsky abhors corporations and refers to them as \\"fascist\\", Chomsky's own retirement fund is invested in large capitalization NYSE companies and the TIAA-CREF stock fund. Schweizer points out: In addition, during his publicity tours, Schweizer spoke of Arianna Huffington's use of private jets for transportation and excessive energy consumption, despite her public pro-environmentalist stance.Cave, Damien. \\"Those Democrats and Their Private Jets\\". The New York Times. August 15, 2004\\"The Human Blog\\". New York Magazine. October 9, 2006 Reception Schweizer's book was generally well-received, showing up on New York Times bestsellers list in early 2006 and garnering praise from pundits such as Bill O'Reilly. A television station in San Francisco, KGO-TV, reviewed Schweizer's claims against Nancy Pelosi. It found Schweizer's allegation that the workers at Pelosi's vineyard were not union workers to be true. The station also reported that the 1975 California Agricultural Labor Relations Act prevents Pelosi from assisting her workers in forming a union; or discussing a union contract with them unless they unionized on their own. The investigating reporter claimed that Pelosi paid her workers more than the largest union winery in the region.Matthews, Mark (November 28, 2006). \\"Pelosi's Napa Business Scrutinized\\".

Al Franken wrote to the conservative publication National Review to dispute Schweizer's claims that he does not hire minorities. He gave several examples of minority employees who have worked on his radio and television shows.Franken, Al. Letter. National Review. August 25, 2006.

This technology, which was introduced in 1962 by Morton Heilig, is considered as one of the earliest virtual reality (VR) systems.  Development  Heilig, who today would be thought of as a \\"multimedia\\" specialist, in the 1950s saw theater as an activity that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He dubbed it \\"Experience Theater\\", and detailed his vision of multi-sensory theater in a 1955 paper, \\"The Cinema of the Future\\" (Robinett 1994). In 1962 he built a prototype of his vision, dubbed the Sensorama, along with five short films for it to display. The Sensorama was a mechanical device, which includes a stereoscopic color display, fans, odor emitters, stereo‐sound system, and a motional chair. It simulated a motorcycle ride through New York and created the experience by having the spectator sit in an imaginary motorcycle while experiencing the street through the screen, fan-generated wind, and the simulated noise and smell of the city. These elements are triggered at the appropriate time such as the case of the release of the exhaust chemicals when rider approached a bus. The petrol fumes and the smell of pizza snack bars were recreated by chemicals. While the machine still functions today, audiences cannot interact with it or that it cannot respond based on the user's actions. Howard Rheingold (in his 1991 book Virtual Reality) spoke of his trial of the Sensorama using a short film piece that detailed a bicycle ride through Brooklyn, created in the 1950s, and still seemed quite impressed by what it could do more than 40 years later. The Sensorama was able to display stereoscopic 3-D images in a wide-angle view, provide body tilting, supply stereo sound, and also had tracks for wind and aromas to be triggered during the film. Heilig was unable to obtain financial backing for his visions and patents, and so the Sensorama work was halted.

National Beverage Corp. is ranked by Beverage Digest as the fifth- largest soft drink company in the United States. History The company was formed in 1985 by Nick A. Caporella to fend off an unwanted acquisition by Victor Posner of Burnup & Sims Inc., an installer of cable television and telecommunications systems, through trading stock between the two companies to reduce Posner's ownership level. Caporella, now having an additional company, needed to have a business to go with it and acquired Shasta Beverages from Sara Lee Corporation in 1985 for US$40 million in cash and Burnup & Sims shares. To make National a major player, Caporella purchased Faygo, a Midwest regional soft drink manufacturer, from Tree Sweet Products Corp. With its 12 bottling plants, National subsidiaries branched out into bottling store brands. In 1991, National Beverage went public to sell Burnup & Sims's shares in National Beverage, which was partially successful. A Burnup & Sims stockholder sued due to Caporella's salary from Burnup and percentage of revenue from National Beverage, forcing Caporella to spend less time managing the company. In the early 1990s, Spree, an all-natural, carbonated soft drink, and Big Shot, a regional, multiflavored soft drink line, were acquired. In 1992, the US Navy contracted for the manufacture of \\"Sea\\", their ship store's brand. In the mid-1990s, juice producer, Everfresh Beverages Inc. and WinterBrook Corp., a carbonated and still water producer, became subsidiaries of National. WinterBrook brought three brands to the National Beverage group of companies: Cascadia, WinterBrook Clear, and LaCroix. National acquired Home Juice Company, home of the Home Juice and Mr. Pure brands, at the end of the 1990s. In the early 2000s, National purchased Beverage Canners International Inc., Ritz, and Crystal Bay soft drinks and sparkling waters brands owner. In 2002, the company changed its strategy by focusing on bottling its own brands and end private-label bottling. National moved to create new products for specific markets starting in 2003 with Shasta Shortz, a kid-focused soda. Also that year, Fruitika, a fruit nectars line, went out to the stores. In 2004, Diet Shasta started using Splenda No Calorie Sweetener. National also launched new energy drink lines starting with Rip It, a general energy drink line. A woman-focused line, Chic, and Freek for teenagers and young adults, soon followed. National also tried a coffee-based energy drink, Triple Hit.

Most of the residents in this neighbourhood belong to the Muhajir community, bangali origin,tracing their roots to Bangladesh and Bihar. History According to local folklore, Model Colony was envisioned by Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and Syed Mohammad Hussain Qadri, who was very close to her and her brother. She asked town planner Mr Makki to lay out a plan for a 'model Muhajir colony'. It was a favored residential area for Karachi's elite until the mid-1980s. The colony has seen sustained deterioration as a result of increased population and ethnic riots that reached their peak from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Following the formation of the Pakistani local government system in 2000, there have been improvements to the sewerage system and road network and now approximately 85% of the houses in the colony have access to the sewerage system.

She was a minor member of the Portland Spy Ring. Early life The daughter of a blacksmith, Ethel Gee lived on the Isle of Portland, England. She left school at 15 to begin employment. In October 1950, she became a filing clerk at the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland. She thus handled top secret documents on Britain's underwater warfare work and , the Royal Navy's first nuclear submarine. A spinster, Gee had limited social life, since her spare time was spent looking after aging relatives, including her mother, aunt and uncle. Spying career Around 1955, Gee met Harry Houghton, a former sailor who had become a civil service clerk. Houghton was an alcoholic; his marriage ended in divorce in 1956\\\\. They would later pose as a married couple when they booked into London hotels. Houghton had been supplying military secrets to spies from People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union for some time. Through Gee, he gained access to more classified material. In July 1960, Houghton introduced Gee to a man whom she claimed to know only as \\"Alex Johnson\\", allegedly a commander in the US Navy. \\"Johnson\\" wanted to know how the British handled confidential information provided them by the Americans. Houghton and Gee were already under surveillance by the British Security Service MI5. A Soviet mole code named \\"Sniper\\", subsequently identified as the defector Michael Goleniewski, had warned Western intelligence that information was being leaked from Portland. Houghton's extravagance, which went far beyond his salary, made him an obvious suspect. MI5 identified \\"Johnson\\" as Gordon Lonsdale, a Canadian businessman. (It would be only much later, when he was in prison, that he was identified as Konon Trofimovich Molody, a Soviet KGB agent.) Gee provided classified material to Houghton, who would photograph it and pass it to Lonsdale in London. On 6 January 1961, Gee left the naval base with pamphlets that contained details of a ASDIC sonar device used to detect submarines. The following day, Houghton and Gee were arrested in London by Special Branch detectives. Also arrested were Lonsdale and Peter and Helen Kroger (alias Morris and Lona Cohen), all of whom were spies working for the Soviets. They were the core members of the Portland Spy Ring. Trial Gee at first protested her innocence, maintaining her claim that she believed that Lonsdale was an American. In the course of the trial, however, she finally admitted: \\"In the light of what transpires now, I have done something terribly wrong, but at that time I did not think I had done anything criminal.\\" Houghton and Gee were both sentenced to 15 years in prison on 22 March 1961. The others spies were given longer sentences but were exchanged early on for captured British agents and citizens. Gee and Houghton served nine years and were released on 12 May 1970; they married in 1971.http://www.genesreunited.co.uk/search.page/results/bmdindexedmarriages/houghton/harry%20f?placekeywords=poole&yearofmarriage;=1971 Ethel Houghton died in obscurity in Poole, Dorset, in 1984, leaving an estate valued for probate at £16,474 (equivalent to £ in ).

It was primarily used as an insecticide, as well as a rodenticide and piscicide. It is a colourless, odorless solid, although commercial samples are often off-white. Endrin was manufactured as an emulsifiable solution known commercially as Endrex. The compound became infamous as a persistent organic pollutant and for this reason it is banned in many countries. In the environment endrin exists as either endrin aldehyde or endrin ketone and can be found mainly in bottom sediments of bodies of water. Exposure to endrin can occur by inhalation, ingestion of substances containing the compound, or skin contact. Upon entering the body, it can be stored in body fats and can act as a neurotoxin on the central nervous system, which can cause convulsions, seizures, or even death. Although endrin is not currently classified as a mutagen, nor as a human carcinogen, it is still a toxic chemical in other ways with detrimental effects. Due to these toxic effects, the manufacturers cancelled all use of endrin in the United States by 1991. Food import concerns have been raised because some countries may have still been using endrin as a pesticide. History J. Hyman & Company first developed endrin in 1950. Shell International was licensed in the United States and in the Netherlands to produce it. Velsicol was the other producer in the Netherlands. Endrin was used globally until the early 1970s. Due to its toxicity, it was banned or severely restricted in many countries. In 1982, Shell discontinued its manufacturing. In 1962, an estimated 2.3-4.5 million kilograms of endrin were sold by Shell in the USA. In 1970, Japan imported 72,000 kilograms of endrin. From 1963 until 1972, Bali used 171 to 10,700 kilograms of endrin annually for the production of rice paddies until endrin use was discontinued in 1972. Taiwan reported to show higher levels of organochlorine pesticides including endrin in soil samples of paddy fields, compared to other Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. During the 1950s-1970s over two million kilograms of organochlorine pesticides were estimated of having been be released into the environment per year. Endrin was banned in the United States on October 10, 1984. Taiwan banned endrin's use as a pesticide in 1971 and regulated it as a toxic chemical in 1989. In May 2004, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into effect and listed endrin as one of the 12 initial persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that have been causing adverse effects on humans and the environment. The convention requires the participating parties to take measures to eliminate or restrict the production of POPs. Production The synthesis of endrin begins with the condensation of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with vinyl chloride. The product is then dehydrochlorinated. Following reaction with cyclopentadiene, isodrin is formed. Epoxide formation by adding either peracetic acid or perbenzoic acid to the isodrin is the final step in synthesizing endrin. Endrin is a stereoisomer of dieldrin with comparable properties, though endrin degrades more easily Use Endrin was formulated as emulsifiable concentrates (ECs), wettable powders (WPs), granules, field strength dusts (FSDs), and pastes. The product could then be applied by aircraft or by handheld sprayers in its various formulations. Endrin has been used primarily as an agricultural insecticide on tobacco, apple trees, cotton, sugar cane, rice, cereal, and grains. It is effective against a variety of species, including cotton bollworms, corn borers, cut worms and grass hoppers. In addition, endrin has been employed as a rodenticide and avicide. In Malaysia, fish farms used a solution of endrin as a piscicide to rid mine pools and fish ponds of all fish prior to restocking. A study conducted from 1981 to 1983 in the US aimed to determine endrin's effects on non-target organisms when applied as a rodenticide in orchards. Most wildlife in and around the orchard was found to have endrin exposure, with endrin toxicity accounting for more than 24% of bird deaths recorded. Endrin was eventually banned in the US on October 10, 1984.  Health effects  = Exposure and metabolism = Exposure to endrin can occur by inhalation, ingestion of substances containing the compound, or by skin contact. In addition to inhalation and skin contact, infants can be exposed by ingesting the breast milk of an exposed woman. In utero, fetuses are exposed by way of the placenta if the mother has been exposed. Upon entering the body, endrin metabolizes into anti-12-hydroxyendrin and other metabolites, which can be expelled in the urine and feces. Both anti-12-hydroxyendrin and its metabolite, 12-ketoendrin, are likely responsible for the toxicity of endrin. The rapid metabolism of endrin into these metabolites makes detection of endrin itself difficult unless exposure is very high. = Neurological effects = Symptoms of endrin poisoning include headache, dizziness, nervousness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and convulsions. Acute endrin poisoning in humans affects primarily the central nervous system. There, it can act as a neurotoxin that blocks the activity of inhibitory neurotransmitters. In cases of acute exposure, this may result in seizures, or even death. Because endrin can be stored in body fats, acute endrin poisoning can lead to recurrent seizures when stressors induce the release of endrin back into the body, even months after the initial exposure is terminated. People occupationally exposed to endrin may experience abnormal EEG readings even if they exhibit none of the clinical symptoms, possibly due to injury to the brain stem. These readings show bilateral synchronous theta waves with synchronous spike-and-wave complexes. EEG readings can take up to one month to return to normal. = Developmental effects = Though endrin exposure has not been found to adversely affect fertility in mammals, an increase in fetal mortality has been observed in mice, rats, and mallard ducks. In those animals that have survived gestation, developmental abnormalities have been observed, particularly in rodents whose mothers were exposed to endrin early in pregnancy. In hamsters, the number of cases of fused ribs, cleft palate, open eyes, webbed feet, and meningoencephaloceles have increased. Along with open eyes and cleft palate, mice have developed with fused ribs and exencephaly. Skeletal abnormalities in rodents have also been reported. = Other effects = Higher doses of endrin have been found to cause the following in rodents: renal tubular necrosis; inflammation of the liver, fatty liver, and liver necrosis; possible kidney degradation; and a decrease in body weight and body weight gain. Endrin is very toxic to aquatic organisms, namely fish, aquatic invertebrates, and phytoplankton. It was found to remain in the tissues of infected fish for up to one month. = 1984 poisoning outbreak in Pakistan = From July 14 to September 26, 1984, an outbreak of endrin poisoning occurred in 21 villages in and around Talagang, a subdistrict of the Punjab province of Pakistan. Eighty percent of the 194 known cases were children under the age of 15. Poisoned individuals had seizures along with vomiting, pulmonary congestion, and hypoxia, leaving 19 people dead. Some individuals had low grade fevers (37.8 °C/100 °F, axillary) following seizures. The more seriously affected had less vomiting, but higher temperatures than people who were less affected. Most patients could be controlled in under two hours using diazepam, phenobarbital, and atropine, though the more seriously affected patients required general anesthesia. Recovery took up to two days. Following treatment, patients reported not remembering their seizures. The outbreak affected both men and women equally. Based on the demographics of the affected individuals and their area of residence, the outbreak was likely caused by endrin contamination of food. As members of these villages rarely had contact with one another, investigators determined that contaminated sugar shipped to the villages was the most probable cause, though no credible evidence was found to support this. Around this time, endrin was being used by cotton and sugar cane farmers in the Punjab region. A number of truck drivers stated that they had used the same trucks to deliver endrin to farmers and to pick up crops for Talagang, possibly leading to contamination.  Environmental behavior  Insecticides like dieldrin and endrin have been shown to persist for decades in the environment. A definitive detection of the residues was not possible until 1971 when mass spectrometer started being used as a detector in gas chromatography. Detection of these chemicals in the environment has been reported across the world up to 2005, even though the frequency of reported cases are low due to its relatively small-scale use and very low concentrations. Endrin regularly enters the environment when applied to crops or when rain washes it off. It has been found in water, sediments, atmospheric air and biotic environment, even after uses have been stopped. Organochlorine pesticides strongly resist degradation, are poorly soluble in water but highly soluble in lipids, which is called lipophilic. This leads to bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of organisms, mainly those dwelling in water. A high bioconcentration factor of 1335-10,000 has been reported in fish. Endrin binds very strongly to organic matter in soil and aquatic sediments due to their high adsorption coefficient, making it less likely to leach into groundwater, even though contaminated groundwater samples have been found. In 2009, EPA released data indicating that the endrin in soil could last up to 14 years or more. The extent of endrin's persistence depends highly on local conditions. For example, high temperature (230 °C) or intense sunlight leads to more rapid breakdown of endrin into endrin ketone and endrin aldehyde, however, this breakdown is less than 5%. = Removal from the environment = In the United States, endrin was mainly disposed in land until U.S. federal regulations were applied in 1987 on land disposal of wastes containing endrin. Primary methods of endrin disappearance from soil are volatilization and photodecomposition. Under ultraviolet light, endrin forms δ-ketoendrin and International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) claims that in intense summer sun, about 50% of endrin is isomerized to δ-ketoendrin in 7 days. In anaerobic conditions microbial degradation by fungi and bacteria takes place to form the same major end product. Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) lists reductive dechlorination and incineration for field disposal of small quantities of endrin. In reductive dechlorination, endrin's chlorine atoms were completely replaced with hydrogen atoms, which is suspected to be more environmentally acceptable. Even though endrin binds very strongly to soil, phytoremediation has been proposed by group of Japanese scientists using crops in the family Cucurbitaceae. , exact mechanisms behind the plant uptake of endrin have not been understood. Research in uptake mechanisms and factors that influence the uptake is needed for practical application. Regulation = United States = In the United States, endrin has been regulated by the EPA. It set a freshwater acute criterion of 0.086 µg/L and a chronic criterion of 0.036 µg/L. In saltwater, the numbers are acute 0.037 and chronic 0.0023 µg/L. The human health contaminate criterion for water plus organism is 0.059 µg/L. The drinking water limit (maximum contaminant level) is set to 2 ppb. Use of endrin in fisheries has been advised against due to the zero tolerance of endrin levels in food products. For occupational exposures to endrin, OSHA and NIOSH have set exposure limits at 0.1 mg/m3. =International organizations= The WHO lists Endrin as an obsolete pesticide in its 'Classification of Pesticides by Hazard' and did not assign any hazard class per the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. = Taiwan= Taiwan is not a party to the Stockholm Convention as of 2015, but has drafted its own \\"National Implementation Plan of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\\" which was approved by the Executive Yuan on April 2008. The Central Competent Authorities of Taiwan sets the limit of 20 mg/kg for soil pollution control. For marine environment quality, standards of 0.002 mg/L has been set. For occupational exposures to endrin, warning has been given that the contact with skin, eyes, and mucous membranes can contribute to the overall exposure.

In the UK, Catholic residential youth work is an important part of the Church's ministry to young people. History There are eleven youth retreat centres in the UK. The centres grew up in the era immediately following the Second Vatican Council, reflecting a renewed interest in both ministry within the Church and in work with young people following the Albermarle Report in the 1960s. Not all of them would use the term retreat centre, but it is a useful catch-all. The oldest one is Soli House in Stratford-Upon-Avon, but it was St Cassian's Centre, Kintbury which pioneered the model of work in the field. St Cassian's (known as Kintbury) was established by Damian Lundy in 1975 and pioneered a system based largely on having a volunteer team of young Catholics near to the ages of the young people they were working with. The system closely followed an Australian system Lundy had observed, a system which, in turn, was heavily based on an approach common in the US. It relied on these young Catholics sharing their stories. Peer ministry was always important to Lundy and narrative theology - the practice of ministry through sharing personal experiences and accounts - has always been an important facet of the De La Salle Brothers, the religious institute to which Lundy belonged. Many of the centres employ a programme based on the one brought by Lundy. Eight of the centres are diocesan (i.e. run by dioceses) and five are run by religious institutes. Religious centres are able to supplement their spiritual side by drawing on the traditions and spirituality of the institute they represent. Diocesan centres, on the other hand often feel far more connected to the Church and therefore have a larger pool of resources and support to draw on and find recruitment to teams and finding clientele slightly easier. Community living and a change of scene Young people at Castlerigg Manor The fact that young people on retreats or courses are brought away from their normal environment and into community living for a week is the basis of much of the practice. By living in community for a week, young people can be encouraged to look out for one another and to strengthening relationships with one another and with God.

TimeTrax refers to a software and hardware platform by parent company Time Trax Technologies Corp. which allows audio recording from satellite radio, Internet streaming and traditional radio broadcasts. The company is best known for its disruptive innovation and leading role it played in the transformation of the business model of the music industry. The original software was created by Scott MacLean to time shift XM Satellite Radio programming using the $50 XM PCR PC- connected satellite radio—doing so by recording the audio to MP3 format, and saving songs as individual MP3 files, named and tagged with the artist and song name. Now, the TimeTrax technology \\"de-aggregates\\" any radio-like broadcast and then reassembles that content, customized for the user. In other words, it records individual songs from the radio, saves each song as individual MP3 files and allows the user to build a music library. Although XM initially encouraged third-party application development for the XM PCR radio, publishing links to third-party applications on its web site, XM discontinued the XM PCR radio after the release of TimeTrax.CNet News.com (August 30, 2004) XM Radio pulls PC hardware amid piracy concerns. Retrieved February 17, 2007. XM publicly stated that the discontinuation of the XM PCR was a previously planned product end-of-life, however several sources from within XM later confirmed that the withdrawal of the product was due to mounting pressure from the RIAA due to the emergence of TimeTrax. After the withdrawal of the XM PCR and because of the popularity of TimeTrax, used XM PCR radios started selling online for as much as $300.  Acquisition by Time Trax  Acquired by Time Trax Technologies Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) in September 2004, the company expanded the product offering to include hardware that functioned with the XM Direct radio, as well as the Sirius Connect radio. They also included functionality to operate with the XM Online streaming audio system. The company registered numerous patents, although there has been much debate about the validity of the patent of their system, due to its simplicity. At the 2006 CES (Consumer Electronics Show), Time Trax announced and demonstrated a new product, TraxCatcher. Traxcatcher resembled a 'clock radio' and had a dock and portable MP3 player. It functioned much like the satellite radio product, but for use with FM radio and had a 'line in'. This demonstrated more depth to the company's claims about their technology because FM radio does not provide the data stream with song name and artist (which provides the timing for 'cuts'). According to the media that got to use the product, it seemed to function as the company claimed (today, despite a commitment from the company, it appears that the product has not been made available for sale). While receiving extensive press and media attention for the very visible consumer software and hardware products, the company also developed an OEM business as well as an international partnership which included the sharing of technologies with a company in Sweden called PopCatcher. After stories featuring MacLean and TimeTrax appeared in the New York Times, USA Today, and in syndicated AP articles, TimeTrax became the de facto standard in time shifting of satellite radio. Time Trax's Elliott Frutkin was a very visible critic of the entertainment industry and provoked the RIAA by press release titles such as \\"Will Time Trax Product Launch Rattle the RIAA, Again?\\" Time Trax was also involved in the Grokster Supreme Court case, insofar as they filed an 'amicus curiae' brief.  2006 events  By July 7, 2006, the address of the TimeTrax home page was redirecting to the XM Radio corporate site. This created significant confusion and speculation that TimeTrax may have either been acquired by XM Radio or forced to shut down. At the same time, an alleged representative from Time Trax asked SatelliteGuys.US to shut down a forum they hosted for the company. After questioning the authenticity of the contact, the forum was restored a short time later to provide information to Time Trax customers as well as wait for an official confirmation from Time Trax. On July 15, 2006, SatelliteGuys.US posted details from an interview with Time Trax's Elliott Frutkin. Although he was unable to speak on details of the issue, he confirmed that TimeTrax was no longer on the consumer market, although there were no current plans to disable the technology infrastructure to allow continued use by individual consumers. Mr. Frutkin hinted at several possibilities the company was considering for their software, some of which included turning the registration servers over to a third party, releasing a patch that would stop TimeTrax from looking for the server, or distribute the software as either freeware or open source. Since then, the TimeTrax website has been restored to its original operation, and hosts previous versions of the TimeTrax software. No further information has been made available regarding the viability of the company, and there has been no confirmation as to whether or not they are still in operation. On November 1, 2006, SatelliteGuys.US closed their Time Trax forum due to a lack of current information about the company.  Current status (2017)  The TimeTrax software was made available for download until 2008 along with a hardware adapter for downloading and MP3 creation purposes. The servers upon which the TimeTrax software relied were shut down in 2013, at which point all operations ceased.

He studied political science at the Catholic University of Nijmegen (currently named Radboud University Nijmegen), graduating with the highest honours. Classical-liberal period Upon graduation he accepted a position with the Prof.mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, a think-tank affiliated with the liberal party VVD. In his years with the Teldersstichting, Kinneging developed into a prolific and influential author on the philosophy of classic liberalism. In the early 1990s, Kinneging became increasingly dissatisfied with classical liberalism. He believed that the VVD was intellectually becoming increasingly pedestrian. He also strongly disagreed with the drift toward social-liberalism within the party. Kinneging finally cancelled his membership of the VVD party in 1999. University career Kinneging returned to the university after briefly working for the Dutch Ministry of Finance. In the late 1980s, he joined the Department of Public Administration of the Leiden University as an assistant professor, where he taught such students as the later member of parliament Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and conservative activist Joshua Livestro. Kinneging earned his PhD with the highest honors on October 1, 1994 with an English dissertation entitled Aristocracy, Antiquity and History - Classicism in Political Thought, later published by Transaction Publishers. The book criticizes the standard literature on Modernity, by pointing out that remnants of classical wisdom - e.g. the ethics of honor - stayed with us for much longer than commonly thought. The book emphasizes Romans over Greeks. Following the trail of Herbert Butterfield (The Whig Interpretation of History), Kinneging rejects the teleological study of the past. Confirmed by a wave of recent historical studies (e.g. Jonathan Dewald's European Nobility) Kinneging holds that the nobles, and thus Roman political and social models, were dominant much longer than suspected. The book is especially esteemed for its central cluster of chapters, which analyze the political and social thought of the Romans, Cicero in particular, in great detail. In 1996 Kinneging moved to the law school of the Leiden University, the oldest and among the most prestigious of Dutch law faculties. Kinneging was quickly promoted to tenured associate professor and accepted a chair in legal philosophy as full professor on August 1, 2004. His fields of expertise are jurisprudence, political philosophy, ethics, axiology, deontology and constitutional theory. Writing his dissertation strengthened the process of intellectual 'conversion' that gradually developed Kinneging from a right-wing liberal into a classical conservative, who reaches back for the intellectual traditions of Greco-Roman antiquity and Judeo-Christian ethics. In 1999 Kinneging started a public debate in the Netherlands devoted to the resuscitation of conservatism, which culminated in the founding of the highly successful think-tank and educational group the Edmund Burke Foundation, of which Kinneging became President. The post-dissertation by Kinneging focused especially on virtue ethics. He also discovered the school of realist phenomenology characterized by such philosophers as Edmund Husserl, Max Scheler, Nicolai Hartmann, Adolf Reinach, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Aurel Kolnai, Edith Stein and others. Kinneging edited a new edition of Nicolai Hartmann's Ethics (in three volumes, 2001-2004). In 2005 he published, in Dutch Geography of Good and Evil, a collection of essays written in the preceding decade. Positions Kinneging was president of the Advisory Board of the Edmund Burke Foundation and chairman of the board of trustees of the Center for European Renewal. He no longer serves on the boards of either organization.

During the end of the 1930s, Gitlow turned to conservatism and wrote two sensational exposés of American Communism, books which were very influential during the McCarthy period. Gitlow remained a leading anti-communist up to the time of his death. Background New York City family makes dolls' clothes by piecework (1912)–as did Gitlow's family Benjamin Gitlow was born on December 22, 1891, in Elizabethport, New Jersey. His parents were Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire; his father, Lewis Albert Gitlow, moved to the United States in 1888, followed by his mother, Katherine, in 1889. In the United States, his father worked part-time for insufficient hours in various factories, while his mother helped the impoverished family to make ends meet by stitching piecework at home for garment factories. Radicalism seems to have run deeply in the family. Guests to the family home told stories about their personal and political experiences in Tsarist Russia. Gitlow later recalled this experience as formative to his own political development: > I would listen intently to the adventures of the Russian revolutionary > leaders, of their experiences with the police, the days and years spent in > prisons and their exile to the wastes of Siberia. I would grow indignant > hearing how the Tsar mistreated the people. I thrilled at the stories of the > underground movement, of the conspiring activities, how deeds of violence > against the Tsarist oppressors were planned... The stories of personal > experiences when raids were made by the secret police upon revolutionists' > homes held me spellbound. I anticipated every incident that would be > related. I also listened to discussions, very idealistic in their essence, > in which the participants showed how Socialism would transform the world, > and to arguments over methods of how Socialism would be achieved. In later years, his mother achieved some notice as an important Communist women's leader, serving as Secretary of the Women's Committee of the Workers Party of America in 1924. Career Newark store, airborne voice: with studio on 6th floor and showy antenna on roof, Bamberger's launched WOR (AM) to sell more radios–Gitlow worked in a department store in New Jersey Gitlow studied law while working as a retail clerk in a department store in Newark, New Jersey. He helped to organize the Retail Clerks Union, political activity for which he was discharged from his job and blacklisted by the Merchants' Association. In June 1914, Gitlow testified before the US Commission on Industrial Relations on conditions prevalent in U.S. department stores. His testimony included descriptions of mandatory overtime, spying on workers, and quid pro quo sexual harassment. Following his blacklisting from the retail sales industry, Gitlow worked briefly as a cutter in the garment industry before entering the world of radical journalism in 1919. =Entry into radical politics= Cover of October 1919 issue of Voice of Labor, issued by the Communist Labor Party As soon as he turned 18 and became eligible for membership, Ben Gitlow joined the Socialist Party of America. Gitlow was a committed and active member of the party and he was elected a delegate to the New York state convention of the SPA in 1910, the year after his joining. In the fall of 1917, Gitlow was elected on the Socialist ticket to the New York State Assembly (Bronx Co., 3rd D.), and sat in the 141st New York State Legislature. He was one of 10 Socialists elected to the Assembly of 1918, all of them from New York City. Despite (or perhaps because of) his two years as a Socialist parliamentarian, Ben Gitlow professed a belief in revolutionary Socialism. From its earliest days in 1919, Gitlow was an adherent of the proto-Communist Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, working closely with renowned radical journalist and war correspondent John Reed. In April 1919, the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of Local Greater New York established an official weekly newspaper called The New York Communist.The complete 10 issue run of The New York Communist was reissued in book form as well as microfilm by Greenwood Reprint Corp., Westport, CT, in 1970. Historian James Weinstein wrote the introduction for this reprint, a contribution which was included in Greenwood's two-volume The American Radical Press, 1880-1960, Joseph R. Conklin, ed., v. 1, pp. 145-154. Reed was named the editor of the new publication, with Maximilian Cohen handling the day-to-day operations of the publication as its business manager. Effective with the June 14, 1919, issue, Max Cohen exited the scene and Ben Gitlow assumed the post of business manager.See: The New York Communist, Westport, CT: Greenwood Reprint Corp.,1970. Issue of June 14, 1919, page 2. Following the Left Wing National Conference in June 1919, Reed's New York Communist was merged with the older and better established newspaper of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, Local Boston, The Revolutionary Age, edited by Louis C. Fraina.The complete run of The Revolutionary Age was also reissued in elephant folio book form as well as microfilm by Greenwood Reprint Corp. in 1968 as part of their \\"Radical Periodicals in the United States\\" series. The introduction for the reprint edition were written by Martin Glaberman and George P. Rawick. This publication was moved to New York and thereafter recognized as the \\"National Organ of the Left Wing Section, Socialist Party,\\" with the former New Yorker Fraina continuing as editor and Ben Gitlow taking over as business manager.The Revolutionary Age, v. 2, no. 1 (July 5, 1919), pg. 2. The publication continued until August 23, 1919, at which time it was replaced by the new national organs of the Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party. John Reed was named the editor of the a new monthly labor magazine of the Left Wing Section, called Voice of Labor. Ben Gitlow also served as business manager of this publication, which was adopted by the Communist Labor Party in the fall, shortly before its termination due to lack of finances. =Arrest and trial= C.E. Ruthenberg (1910) led the Communist Party that Gitlow helped co-found For his publicized connection on the staff of The Revolutionary Age Benjamin Gitlow was targeted for arrest during the coordinated raid of the Communist movement conducted by New York state authorities and the Department of Justice during the night of November 7/8, 1919. Gitlow was charged with violation of the New York Criminal Anarchy Law of 1902, which made it a crime to encourage the violent overthrow of government. It was contended that the publication of the Left Wing Manifesto by The Revolutionary Age earlier that year constituted such illegal action. Ben Gitlow's widely publicized trial began in New York City on January 22, 1920, and went to the jury on February 5. Gitlow addressed the jury in his own defense in the case, saying: > I am charged in this case with publishing and distributing a paper known as > The Revolutionary Age, in which paper was printed a document known as the > Left Wing Manifesto and Program. It is held that that document advocates the > overthrow of government by force, violence, and unlawful means. The document > itself, the Left Wing Manifesto, is a broad analysis of conditions, economic > conditions, and historical events in the world today. It is a document based > upon the principles of socialism from their earliest inception. The only > thing that the document does is to broaden those principles in the light of > modern events.... The socialists have always maintained that the change from > capitalism to socialism would be a fundamental change, that is, we would > have a complete reorganization of society, that this change would not be a > question of reform; that the capitalist system of society would be > completely changed and that that system would give way to a new system of > society based on a new code of laws, based on a new code of ethics, and > based on a new form of government. For that reason, the socialist philosophy > has always been a revolutionary philosophy and people who adhered to the > socialist program and philosophy were always considered revolutionists, and > I as one who maintain that, in the eyes of the present day society, I am a > revolutionist.Benjamin Gitlow, The \\"Red Ruby\\": Address to the Jury. New > York: Communist Labor Party, [1920], pg. 4. The attempt of the Gitlow defense to declare the publication of the Left Wing Manifesto an expression of historical analysis rather than an act of practical advocacy was unsuccessful, however. Gitlow was convicted of the charge against him and on February 11, 1920, was sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. He served over two years at Sing Sing prison before being released on bail related to his filing of a writ of error. Gitlow's appeal motion was ultimately granted on December 13, 1922, followed by further hearings by the state. =Political activity after prison= Following his release from prison on bail in the spring of 1922, Ben Gitlow was made a full-time employee of the Communist Party of America. The governing Central Executive Committee named him as Industrial Organizer (party organizer in the unions) for a large area which stretched from New York City to Philadelphia and which encompassed the entire New England region.Details on Gitlow's inner party activity may be found in the files of the Communist Party USA held by the Comintern Archives in Moscow. This material from the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History (RGASPI) is part of fond 515, opis 1, and was microfilmed in 326 reels in the mid-1990s. Film is available for sale from the Dutch company IDC. He was elected as a delegate to the Communist Party's ill-fated August 1922 convention held at Bridgman, Michigan, a gathering which was infiltrated by a Justice Department spy and raided by police. Gitlow was arrested and jailed in the aftermath, eventually released on bail. Ultimately only 2 of the delegates to this convention were tried, trade union leader William Z. Foster (freed when the jury failed to agree) and Workers Party Executive Secretary C.E. Ruthenberg, who was convicted but who died before appeals were finalized and the sentence imposed. From May 1923 until early in 1924, Gitlow — a devoted partisan of the party faction headed by C.E. Ruthenberg and an opponent of the faction headed by William Z. Foster — was named the editor of the Workers' Party's Yiddish language daily, the Morgen Freiheit, this despite the American-born and educated Gitlow's faltering familiarity with the language. The appointment was political in nature and Gitlow was removed from the paper as soon as the Foster faction achieved majority control of the party apparatus. In 1924, Gitlow was named the candidate of the Workers Party of America for Vice President of the United States. =Return to prison= Jay Lovestone, to whose faction Gitlow belonged Three years after his release on bail, on June 8, 1925, the US Supreme Court upheld his conviction in the case of Gitlow v. New York, by a vote of 7 to 2, confirming that the publication of the Left Wing Manifesto in The Revolutionary Age did, in fact, constitute a punishable act under the law. As the legal wrangling and backstage politics continued, Ben Gitlow prepared to return to jail. In November 1925, Gitlow was ordered back to Sing Sing Prison by the court to finish his sentence. This would not be \\"hard time,\\" however. Gitlow was immediately transferred to a new section of the prison located on a hill, a much more comfortable facility than that in which he had previously been confined. Gitlow was assigned to a cleaning detail that occupied only about one hour of his time. The cells had fresh air, a comfortable mattress, hot water in the basin, and clean, smoothly painted steel walls. Gitlow later recalled that \\"had a bath been included, it would have been equivalent to a good small room in a modern hotel.\\" Gitlow anticipated a short stay in the facility as the American Civil Liberties Union assured him that it had obtained a verbal commitment from Governor Al Smith that Gitlow would be pardoned expeditiously. On December 11, 1925, Gitlow's first wedding anniversary, he was visited by his wife, who showed him a letter from an ACLU attorney stating that he would be free to leave Sing Sing on parole if he agreed to the conditions of his release. Gitlow considered this an unfortunate turn of events, as he sought freedom to continue his political activities without the constraint of parole supervision and the threat of a rapid return to jail. Gitlow's wife received word by telephone at that time that his decision on whether to accept a parole was moot, however, as the Governor had decided to grant him a full pardon. Freed from jail the next day, Gitlow arrived by train to a packed Grand Central Station, where he received a rousing hero's welcome from the assembled party members and friends. In 1926, Gitlow ran on the ticket of the Workers Party of America for Governor of New York. In 1928, Gitlow was once again named the candidate of the Workers Party of America for Vice President of the United States, running for a second time on a ticket headed by William Z. Foster. Gitlow reached the summit of his political life as a Communist Party leader shortly after the conclusion of the 1928 campaign, when on March 16, 1929, Gitlow was named to the three-man Secretariat at the helm of the Communist Party, assuming the post of Executive Secretary. His time at the top proved to be momentary, however, as on March 23 he boarded an ocean liner for Moscow as part of a 10-person delegation seeking to appeal the Comintern's decision to expel Jay Lovestone from the Communist Party. The job of Executive Secretary was turned over to factional ally Robert Minor in the interim. =Radical oppositionist= Logo of the Communist Party of the USA (Opposition) group, which Gitlow co-founded with Jay Lovestone in 1929 In 1929 Communist Parties around the world were purged of so-called \\"Right Oppositions\\" by the Communist International as the world Communist movement lurched towards the revolutionary left. Together with his factional co-thinker Jay Lovestone, Ben Gitlow was expelled from the party as purported supporters of Nikolai Bukharin in the USSR in opposition to the hardline faction of Joseph Stalin. The expelled Communists followed Lovestone into a new organization, the so-called Communist Party (Majority Group), which actually included a small fraction of the membership of the regular Communist Party. Gitlow was named a member of the governing National Council of the CP(MG) in October 1929. At the 1st National Conference of the organization, held July 4–6, 1930 in New York City, Gitlow was elected Secretary of the Lovestone political organization, a role in which he continued at least through 1932.See: Benjamin Gitlow, Some Plain Words on Communist Unity. New York: Workers Age Publishing Co., n.d. [c. May 1932]; pp. 5-6, in which Gitlow reprints a letter dated April 20, 1932, listing him as \\"Secretary\\" of a three man Secretariat that included Jay Lovestone and Will Herberg. In the fall of 1930, Gitlow was sent on a month-long tour of the United States on behalf of the Lovestoneites, taking him to Detroit, Chicago, and Superior, Wisconsin before returning to the east coast.\\"Report of the Gitlow Tour,\\" The Revolutionary Age, vol. 1, no. 21 (November 22, 1930), pg. 14. Throughout the first 5 years of its existence the Lovestone organization continued to seek accommodation with the regular Communist Party. Gitlow's own views had gradually changed, however. In May 1933 he and Lazar Becker split from the Lovestoneites to found the Workers Communist League, which in turn merged with a group around B.J. Field to form the Organization Committee for a Revolutionary Workers Party the next year.Max Shachtman, \\"Footnote for Historians,\\" The New International, v. 4, no. 12 (Dec. 1938), pp. 377-379. =Conservative years= Martin Dies Jr. of the Dies Committee subpoenaed Gitlow to testify After briefly rejoining the Socialist Party in 1934, Gitlow became disillusioned with radicalism of all shades and emerged as an outspoken anti-communist. In 1939, he publicly rejected the Communist Party in testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, chaired by Martin Dies, Jr. of Texas.Associated Press. \\"CLASH OVER REDS MARKS DIES INQUIRY; Marcantonio Denies I.L.D. Link With Communists, but Gitlow Contradicts Him; LATTER CITES INCOME; Organization Is Main Support of The Daily Worker, Witness Says at Hearing\\" New York Times October 18, 1939 In 1940, Gitlow published his first work of political autobiography, I Confess: The Truth About American Communism. The book was controversial and widely noticed, pushing Gitlow into the public eye as a leading opponent of American Communism. The book remains an important primary document for the study of American Communism in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1948, Gitlow followed his 1940 memoir with a steamier retelling of old tales called The Whole of Their Lives: Communism in America. Non- specialists should use the historical accounts in this later book, written as a potboiler for the popular market, with great caution as some of its details are at variance with the same stories told by the same author nearly a decade earlier. Also in 1948, he joined the American Jewish League Against Communism. On May 1, 1950, in Mosinee, Wisconsin, a local American Legion outpost staged a mock Communist takeover to illustrate what life under Soviet conquest might be like. Gitlow played the role of General Secretary of the \\"United Soviet States of America\\", while ex-Communist Joseph Zack Kornfeder played the new commissar of the newly renamed town of \\"Moskva.\\" A Soviet flag flew in front of the American Legion outpost.\\"Mosinee in Hands of 'Reds' After a Make Believe Coup\\", Milwaukee Journal, May 1, 1950\\"Mayor, Pastor Die at Mosinee\\", Milwaukee Journal, May 8, 1950, p3; \\"D-Day in Mosinee\\" , by Carl Weinberg, OAH Magazine of History (October 2010) Ben Gitlow's final pamphlets, written in the early 1960s, were published by fundamentalist preacher Billy James Hargis's Christian Crusade Ministries, an organization committed to stopping the spread of Communism in the world.Some of Rev. Hargis's books include Communist America — Must It Be? (1960), The Facts About Communism and Our Churches (1962), Communism: The Total Lie (1963), The Real Extremists — The Far Left (1964), and Our Enemy in Vietnam is Russia! (1969). Personal life and death In 1924, Gitlow married Badana Zeitlin. Benjamin Gitlow died in Crompond, New York, on July 19, 1965. Gitlow's papers are housed at the Hoover Institution Archives, located at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California and at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

The park system was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux and developed between 1868 and 1876. The park system was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Components The Delaware Park–Front Park System encompasses the following parts: See also: and =Delaware Park= The centerpiece of the Buffalo, New York parks system and located in the North Buffalo neighborhood. The park was named simply The Park by Olmsted; it was later renamed Delaware Park because of its proximity to Delaware Avenue, Buffalo's mansion row. It is divided into two areas: the \\"Meadow Park\\" on the east and the \\"Water Park\\", with what was originally a lake (\\"Gala Water\\"), on the west. The ravine and picnic grove on the south side of the lake comprise a subdivision of the latter. A widening of Scajaquada Creek, which flows westward through the park, is called Hoyt Lake (originally Mirror Lake). The lake was a feature during the Pan-American Exposition. The Scajaquada Expressway bisects the park west to east. The Albright-Knox Art Gallery occupies the park's western edge, overlooking Hoyt Lake, and the Buffalo History Museum is situated on its northern edge, overlooking Scajaquada Creek. The park is home to Shakespeare in Delaware Park, a summer tradition since the mid-1970s, and the second largest free outdoor Shakespeare festival in the United States (after New York City's). It is also the location of the Buffalo Zoo on the east side of Meadow Park. The park also has a golf course, four baseball diamonds, cross country running, tennis courts, and a few soccer fields. Contributing structures are: Caretakers Cottage (1889); Lincoln Parkway Bridge (1900), designed by Green and Wicks; Rose Garden Pergola (1912); Stone Bridge (ca. 1887), the only remaining structure from the original Olmsted plan; Parkside Lodge (1914); Rumsey Shelter House (1900); Main Zoo Building (1935-1940); Shelter House (ca. 1900); and Elephant House (ca. 1912). Located north of the park are the Parkside East Historic District and Parkside West Historic District and to the south are the Elmwood Historic District–East and Elmwood Historic District–West, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Statue of David The park is also home to a noted replica of Michelangelo's David. The statue was dedicated in 1903, one of only a few made directly from the original sculpture but included a fig leaf which was not present in the original. When the statue was rededicated in 2013, it was given a new plaque which corrected the spelling of the artist name from Michael Angelo to Michelangelo. =Gates Circle= Originally Chapin Place, a plot measuring at the intersection of Delaware Avenue, Lafayette Avenue, and Chapin Parkway. The circle's center contains a monumental sunken fountain constructed in 1904. =Chapin Parkway= Connects Gates Circle and Soldier's Place; in length. =Soldier's Place= Consists of an area in diameter at the juncture of Bidwell Parkway, Lincoln Parkway, Bird Avenue, and Chapin Parkway.

In one week of combat Hillary personally claimed five Bf 109s shot down, claimed two more probably destroyed and one damaged.https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/11/last-enemy-now/ Hillary wrote about his first experience in a Supermarine Spitfire in The Last Enemy: On 3 September 1940 he had just made his fifth \\"kill\\" when he was shot down by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 flown by Hauptmann Helmuth Bode of II./JG 26: Unable to bail out of the flaming aircraft immediately, Hillary sustained extensive burns to his face and hands. Before it crashed he fell out of the stricken Spitfire unconscious. Regaining his senses whilst falling through space, he deployed a parachute and landed in the North Sea, where he was subsequently rescued by lifeboat Lord Southborough (ON 688) from the Margate Station. Hillary was taken for medical treatment to the Royal Masonic Hospital, Hammersmith, London; and afterwards, under the direction of the surgeon Archibald McIndoe, to the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, in Sussex. He endured three months of repeated surgery in an attempt to repair the damage to his hands and face, and went on to become one of the best known members of McIndoe's \\"Guinea Pig Club\\". He wrote an account of his experiences, published in 1942 under the title Falling Through Space in the United States, and as The Last Enemy in Great Britain. In 1941, Hillary persuaded the British authorities to send him to America to rally support for Britain's war effort. While in the United States, he spoke on the radio, had a love affair with the actress Merle Oberon, and drafted much of The Last Enemy. Hillary managed to bluff his way back into a flying position even though, as was noted in the officers' mess, he could barely handle a knife and fork. He returned to service with No 54 Operational Training Unit at RAF Charterhall after recovering from his injuries, for a conversion course to pilot light bomber aircraft. Death Hillary was killed in his 24th year on 8 January 1943, along with Navigator/Radio Operator Sgt. Wilfred Fison, when he crashed a Bristol Blenheim during a night training flight in adverse weather conditions, the aircraft coming down on farmland in Berwickshire, Scotland.'Air Crash sites Scotland' website, entry detailing the air crash death of Hillary. http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/blenheim_charterhall.htm A funeral took place at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 25 January 1943 at 12:30pm, followed by the cremation of his body at Golders Green Crematorium, where he is commemorated on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorial. His ashes were scattered from a Douglas Boston over the English Channel by his former 603 Squadron commanding officer, Wing Commander George Denholm. Commemoration In 2001 a memorial to Hillary was unveiledhttps://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/44069 at the site of the former RAF Charterhall near Greenlaw, Berwickshire.https://www.berwickshirenews.co.uk/news/duke-remembers-dead-of- raf-charterhall-1-241795 His love affair with Mary Booker, which lasted from December 1941 until his death, was the subject of Michael Burn's book Mary and Richard (1988).

Gulberg Town was formed in 2001 as part of The Local Government Ordinance 2001, and was subdivided into 13 union councils. The town system was disbanded in 2011, and New Karachi Town was re-organized as part of Karachi Central District in 2015.  Location  New Karachi was in the northern part of Karachi, Pakistan, located between the Lyari River, the Manghopir Hills and two major roads – Surjani Road to the north and Shahrah-e-Zahid Hussain to the south. To the north and west was Gadap Town, and to the south lie the towns of Gulberg Town and North Nazimabad Town. The population of New Karachi Town was estimated to be more than 680,000 at the 1998 census. History The federal government under Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup d'etat, introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \\"third tier of government\\" (administrative divisions) and replaced it with the fourth tier (districts). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former Karachi Division in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including New Karachi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation system was reintroduced. In 2015, New Karachi Town was re-organized as part of Karachi Central district.

Livingston recruited men from Chambly, Quebec as early as September 1775, A footnote references letters sent by Livingston on September 16 and 18 from Point Olivier. but a formal regimental designation was made by Richard Montgomery on November 20, 1775, with recognition by the Second Continental Congress following on January 8, 1776. The regiment, which never approached its authorized size of 1,000 men, saw action primarily in the Canadian theater and New York, and was disbanded on January 1, 1781, at King's Ferry, New York. Formation In September 1775, colonial forces under the command of Philip Schuyler and Richard Montgomery crossed into Quebec with the aim of driving British military forces from Montreal and Quebec City. Guy Carleton, the British governor and military commander, had fortified Fort Saint-Jean as the primary defense of Montreal. The colonial forces, preparing to besiege the fort, sought local support. James Livingston, a grain merchant living near Chambly, about from Saint-Jean, raised a local militia, which in October assisted in the siege and capture of Fort Chambly, and the capture of supplies intended for the besieged moving on the Richelieu River.Livingston, pp. 235–237 Following the fall of Montreal, Livingston was authorized by Montgomery on November 20 to raise a regiment to assist in the coming assault on Quebec City. In eight days he raised approximately 200 men.Smith, p. 86 The regiment received formal recognition from the Second Continental Congress on January 8, 1776.Livingston, p. 238 The regiment at first consisted of a mix of Canadiens, Acadiens, and Anglophones. Two of Livingston's brothers served in the regiment. Richard Livingston was a lieutenant colonel, and Abraham served as a captain. Service =Quebec= When Montgomery's army arrived outside Quebec, the 1st Canadian consisted of two to three hundred Canadiens.Institute of Canada Annual Report, p. 44 On December 31, 1775, the regiment was charged with making a diversion at Quebec City's Saint Jean gate, to draw British attention away from the primary attacks, which were led by Benedict Arnold and Richard Montgomery, and were directed at the city's Lower Town. The diversions did not work, and the battle ended disastrously for the Americans, with Montgomery killed, Arnold wounded, and about 400 men taken prisoner. The remnants of the army, then under Arnold's command, besieged the city until May 1776, when British reinforcements began arriving, forcing the Americans into a panicked retreat. The retreat ended at Sorel on May 20, where they were met by reinforcements, and eventually put under the command of General John Sullivan. =Trois-Rivières= On the night of June 7, 1776, Livingston's regiment was part of a force of about 2,000 under Brigadier General William Thompson that returned from Sorel to Trois-Rivières to drive off what they believed to be 300 to 600 British troops from Quebec. When they arrived near Trois-Rivières, they instead found the vanguard of the British counteroffensive, numbering several thousand. After a brief skirmish, the Americans forces were broken, and made a disorganized retreat back to Sorel. Following this battle, the regiment retreated with the rest of the army to Fort Ticonderoga. While the regiment had never been particularly large (Livingston never had more than a few hundred men under arms at any one time), the retreat from Quebec left the regiment much reduced in size, since anyone leaving the province was unlikely to be able to return. =New York= Following the army's return to Ticonderoga, the regiment was assigned garrison duty in upstate New York, primarily the Mohawk and Schoharie valleys, so that it could be reorganized.Gardiner, p. 178Wright, p. 60 During this time, Livingston was known to be recruiting in New York City.Magazine of American History, p. 72 Following Burgoyne's invasion from Quebec in 1777, the regiment was moved to the upper Hudson River valley. In August 1777, the regiment was assigned to Benedict Arnold on his expedition in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix. It then saw service in both Battles of Saratoga as part of Ebenezer_Learned's brigade. This map shows movements and battle sites of Canadian regiments in the Revolutionary War =Rhode Island= The regiment saw action in the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778. =Garrison duty= For the remainder of the war, the regiment had garrison duty in New York. Most notably, Colonel Livingston was in command of Verplanck's Point on the Hudson River in September 1780, and played a crucial role in the unmasking of Benedict Arnold's treachery. While on guard duty, his troops fired on the British sloop of war Vulture, forcing that vessel to retreat southwards. This ship had brought Major John André to meet with General Arnold, who was then in command at West Point. Since the ship was driven off, André was forced to attempt travel by land to New York, when he was captured not far from the British lines near Tarrytown with incriminating papers in his possession. André was hanged as a spy, and Arnold, his plot discovered, managed to escape to the British lines. Disbandment The regiment was disbanded as part of a major reorganization on January 1, 1781, at King's Ferry, New York. Members that remained in service were assigned to the 2nd Canadian Regiment.Wright, p. 157 See also *Moses Hazen Notes References   Category:Military units and formations established in 1775 Category:Military units and formations of the Continental Army Category:French Canadians in the American Revolution Category:Military units and formations of Quebec Category:Expatriate units and formations Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1781 ","title":"1st Canadian Regiment"},{"id":"3599553","title":"Nathan Scott"},{"id":"3599557","text":"Fatima Jinnah Colony () is a neighborhood in the Karachi Central district of Karachi, Pakistan.

Refinishing can apply to a variety of surfaces and materials such as wood, glass, metal, plastic and paint, although in Britain, when referring to wood or wooden furniture it is commonly known as repolishing - short for re- French Polishing. There are a great variety of both traditional and modern finishes, including the use of faux finishes. One interesting modern development in refinishing is the art of distressing or antiquing, making the finishes of pieces look older.

The village of Isdalstø lies immediately north of Knarvik. The village has a population (2019) of 5,875 and a population density of . This makes it the largest settlement in the Nordhordland district of Vestland. Knarvik Senter mall Knarvik videregåande skule The center of the village is the site of the Knarvik Senter, the largest shopping centre in Nordhordland with 61 stores. The European route E39 highway runs straight through the village dividing it into two major parts. The northern part is where the large shopping mall is located while the southern part is still in its original state with scattered buildings and shops. Knarvik has several kindergartens, a junior high school, and a regional high school (Knarvik vidaregåande skule) with more than 1,000 students. One of those students is Mesfin. The newly built Knarvik Church was completed in 2014 to serve the growing community. Before its completion, residents had to travel up to Alversund Church in the village of Alversund, located about to the north. Transportation In recent years population and traffic has increased creating demand for an upgrade of the infrastructure. Rush hour traffic is an increasingly common sight. Today, Knarvik is connected with Bergen via the Hagelsund Bridge (finished 1982) and the Nordhordland Bridge (finished 1994). The car ferry connection between Knarvik and Bergen (Knarvik – Steinestø), that historically transported cars and people between the two places was in use up until the completion of the Nordhordland Bridge.

Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is responsible for the seventh step in biosynthesis of protoporphyrin IX. This porphyrin is the precursor to hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in animals, and chlorophyll, the dye in plants. The enzyme catalyzes the dehydrogenation (removal of hydrogen atoms) of protoporphyrinogen IX (the product of the sixth step in the production of heme) to form protoporphyrin IX. One additional enzyme must modify protoporphyrin IX before it becomes heme. Inhibition of this enzyme is a strategy used in certain herbicides.  Gene  The PPOX gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 at position 22, from base pair 157,949,266 to base pair 157,954,082.  Function  This gene encodes the penultimate enzyme of heme biosynthesis, which catalyzes the 6-electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to form protoporphyrin IX. This protein is a flavoprotein associated with the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane.  Heme biosynthetic pathway  The following genes encode enzymes that catalyze the various steps in the heme biosynthetic pathway: * ALAD: aminolevulinate, delta-, dehydratase * ALAS1: aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 1 * ALAS2: aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 2 (sideroblastic/hypochromic anemia) * CPOX: coproporphyrinogen oxidase * FECH: ferrochelatase (protoporphyria) * HMBS: hydroxymethylbilane synthase * PPOX: protoporphyrinogen oxidase * UROD: uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase * UROS: uroporphyrinogen III synthase (congenital erythropoietic porphyria)  Clinical significance  Variegate porphyria is caused by mutations in the PPOX gene. More than 100 mutations that can cause variegate porphyria have been identified in the PPOX gene. One mutation, a substitution of the amino acid tryptophan for arginine at position 59 (also written as Arg59Trp or R59W), is found in about 95 percent of South African families with variegate porphyria. Mutations in the PPOX gene reduce the activity of the enzyme made by the gene, allowing byproducts of heme production to build up in the body. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as certain drugs, alcohol and dieting), causes this type of porphyria.

First Fruits is a religious offering of the first agricultural produce of the harvest. In classical Greek, Roman, and Hebrew religions, the first fruits were given to priests as an offering to deity. In Christian faiths, the tithe is similarly given as a donation or offering serving as a primary source of income to maintain the religious leaders and facilities. In some Christian texts, Jesus Christ, through his resurrection, is referred to as the first fruits of the dead. Beginning in 1966 a unique \\"First Fruits\\" celebration brought the Ancient African harvest festivals that became the African American holiday, Kwanzaa. Ancient historical =In ancient Greece= In Classical Athens the First Fruits were called an offering of aparche.. Except during times of war, this would be a major source of funds for the temples of the Eleusinian goddesses, Demeter and Kore. Much of the agricultural offering was sold by the temple with the proceeds being used to pay for the daily upkeep of the temple complex. Under Pericles' rule, it became a way of extending Athens' power. The Demos or voting citizens would control the operation of the temple by elected boards. During times of war or for other necessity the Demos would borrow money from the treasury of the temple. Neighboring cities under Athens' control were required to give offerings from their harvests. This served to enrich Athens and extend her power. Much of this was shown in the temple reports which were carved in stone when the governing body (called the epistatai) of the temple changed hands. In the stone IG I3 386-387 it can be seen how the finances of the Eleusinian temples worked. Doctor Maureen B. Cavanaugh who translated stone IG I3 386–387, argues that there were heavy implications of the funding realized from the First Fruits donations to the temple, in particular that it brought significant impact on Athenian power.Maureen B. Cavanaugh [PhD], Eleusis and Athens: Documents in Finance, Religion and Politics in the Fifth Century B.C. , Scholars Press, Published 1996, . This is noted in a loan cited in the stone record, of over 20,000 silver drachmas to the city. Inscription IG I2 76 shows the provisions made for the offering of first fruits to Demeter and Kore by Athenian demes, Athens' allies and other Greek cities. It sets out that one six-hundredth of the barley crop and one twelve-hundredth of the wheat was to be offered to the goddesses. The proposal for the decree came from a special board of 'draftsmen' (syngrapheis), which suggests that the matter was deemed relatively complicated. Sacrifices were to be paid for out of the proceeds from the barley and wheat, votive offerings were to be made to the two goddesses, and the rest of the grain was to be sold. There were clearly concerns that some allies might avoid offering grain by claiming that they had come to Athens but never been received by officials there. So, the inscription insists that the Hieropoioi accept the grain within five days, or otherwise be subject to a substantial fine of 1000 drachmas. In order to draw in other Greeks, the Hieropoioi were then to record the weight of grain received on a board and distribute it to other cities, encouraging them to contribute. Lampon, a renowned seer in fifth-century Athens, moved a rider in which he proposed several changes to the draft decree: that the decree should be inscribed on stelai both in Eleusis and in Athens, that there should be an intercalary month in the following year, and that the Pelargikon (sacred land around the western end of the Acropolis) should be tidied up and protected. This demonstrates the authority which he gained from his expertise as a seer – notable since the Athenians tended to shy away from the recognition of experts in most fields. The motivation behind the offering of first fruits is a combination of three religious factors: the need to honour the two goddesses, obedience to Apollo (in the form of the oracle), and 'ancestral custom'. The last two factors suggest that a recent oracle was in line with an older practice which had either fallen into disuse, or was being transformed into a much larger affair. In return for the offering, 'there will be many benefits in abundance of good harvests if they are men who do not injure the Athenians'.IG I2 76, 45-6 The reward, therefore, although it could only be guaranteed by the gods, was conditional on not injuring Athens. The decree cannot be dated precisely, however the combination of specific religious policy and Athenian political dominance evident here is relevant throughout Athens' imperial period. It is an example of Athens striving to advertise her claims to leadership in Greece, whilst simultaneously binding herself more closely with her allies. Similar to this is the expectation that allies would bring annual tribute to the City Dionysia, and sacrificial contributions to the Panathenaea. Hebrew perspective In Ancient Israel, First Fruits was a type of offering that was akin to, but distinct from, terumah gedolah. While terumah gedolah was an agricultural tithe, the First-fruits, discussed in the Bikkurim tractate of the Talmud, were a sacrificial gift brought up to the altar (Bikkurim 3:12). The major obligation to bring First Fruits (henceforth: Bikkurim) to the Temple began at the festival of Shavuot and continued until the festival of Sukkot (Bikkurim 1:6). This tithe was limited to the traditional seven agricultural products (wheat, barley, grapes in the form of wine, figs, pomegranates, olives in the form of oil, and dates) grown in Israel.Singer, Isidore, ed. (1901) Jewish Encyclopedia (Funk and Wagnals) ASIN: B000B68W5S s.v. \\"Heave-Offering\\" This tithe, and the associated festival of Shavuot, is legislated by the Torah.Exodus ; Leviticus ; Deuteronomy ; et al. Textual critics speculate that these regulations were imposed long after the offerings and festival had developed.Friedman, Richard Elliott (1997), Who Wrote the Bible? HarperOne. By the time of classical antiquity, extensive regulations regarding Bikkurim were recorded in the classical rabbinical literature.Black, Matthew, ed. (2001), Peake's commentary on the Bible, Routledge According to Jewish law, the corners of fields, wild areas, left- overs after harvesting (gleanings), and unowned crops were not subjected to (and could not be used as) the tithe of First Fruits (they were intended to be left as charity for the poor, and other mendicants); plants from outside Israel were also prohibited from inclusion in the tithe, as was anything belonging to non-Jews.Singer, ed., Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Sacrifice\\" The rules also specify that each type of product had to be individually tithed, even if the numbers were balanced so that there was no difference in amount between this situation and using just some types of First Fruit as the tithe, and retaining others in their entirety. Fruit which was allocated to the tithe could not be swapped for fruit which wasn't, to the extent that wine couldn't be swapped for vinegar, and olive oil couldn't be replaced by olives; furthermore, fruits were not allowed to be individually divided if only part went to the tithe (small whole pomegranates had to be used rather than sections from a large pomegranate, for example). The separation of tithed produce from untithed produce was also subject to regulation. The individual(s) separating one from the other had to be ritually clean, and had to include the best produce in the tithe if a kohen (priest) lived nearby. During the act of separation, the produce was not permitted to be counted out to determine which fell under the tithe, nor to be weighed for that purpose, nor to be measured for the same reason, but instead the proportion that was to become the tithe had to be guessed at. In certain situations, such as when tithed produce became mixed with non-tithed produce (or there was uncertainty as to whether it had), the tithed produce had to be destroyed. Anyone who made mistakes in the separation of tithed produce, and anyone who consumed any of the tithe, was required to pay compensation as a guilt offering. The pilgrims that brought the Bikkurim to the Temple were obligated to recite a declaration, also known as the Avowal, set forth in Deuteronomy 26:3-10 (cf. Mishnah, Bikkurim 3:6). Native-born Israelites and proselytes would bring the Bikkurim and would say the Avowal, but women who brought the Bikkurim were not permitted to say the Avowal, since they were unable to claim inheritance in the Land bequeathed unto the tribes by their male lineage. This Avowal was incorporated into a beautiful and grand festive celebration with a procession of pilgrims marching up to Jerusalem and then the Temple with gold, silver or willow baskets to which live birds were tied. (Bikkurim 3:3,5 and 8). The pilgrims were led by flutists to the city of Jerusalem where they were greeted by dignitaries (Bikkurim 3:3). The procession would then resume with the flutist in lead until the Temple Mount where the Levites would break out in song (Bikkurim 3:4). The birds were given as sacrificial offerings and the declaration would be made before a priest while the basket was still on the pilgrim's shoulder (Bikkurim 3:5-6). After the basket was presented to the priest, it was placed by the Altar and the pilgrim would bow and leave (Bikkurim 3:6). Christian perspective The idea of having the First Fruits blessed at the church has been celebrated through the feast of Lammas (Loaf Mass Day) in Western Christianity. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the 'first fruits' tradition is kept during the Feast of the Transfiguration, held on August 6/19. In the canonical gospels, the harvest of First Fruits is used metaphorically and allegorically. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is described as stating that \\"in the time of harvest\\" he would instruct the harvesters (i.e., the angels) to gather the \\"tares\\", bind them into bundles, and burn them, but to \\"gather the wheat into [his] barn\\" (). Some argue that this teaching is about the Last Judgment rather than offering any thanksgiving to a deity, the “tares” being sinners or unbelievers of God and his son Jesus and the \\"wheat\\" being believers of God, although it also fits the rapture as noted in and . Other Christians, as well as early Gnostic writers, argued it was less about sin and more about following Jesus' teachings and abandoning the teachings they had formerly known. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is described as stating \\"...he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together\\" (), which some Christians argue is about rewards from God for those who perform God's work. First Corinthians also referred to Jesus' resurrection as a type of First Fruit, \\"But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.\\" =In Eastern Christianity= In the Eastern Orthodox Church the offering of first fruits takes the form of a thanksgiving and blessing. The produce is then consumed by the faithful rather than being given to the Church (though it may be donated as a free-will offering). The liturgical concept behind the blessing is the faithful offering back to God a token of that which he in his lovingkindness has provided, God blessing these firstfruits and returning them to the faithful for their benefit and blessing. The blessing of first fruits traditionally begins on the Great Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6), with the blessing of grapes. In localities where grapes are not grown, other early-ripening fruits such as apples may be offered. There is a special ceremony at the end of the Divine Liturgy at which the priest blesses the first fruits, asking \\"...that the Lord may bless them, that they may be to us unto rejoicing, and that He may accept a gift of these fruits unto the cleansing of our sins...\\" As the harvest season progresses, the first fruits of each species can be brought to the church to be blessed, using a similar format, but a different prayer: \\"...that the Lord may receive our gift unto His eternal treasury and grant us an abundance of earthly goods...\\" =In Western Christianity= In the Middle Ages the concept of offering the first fruits was adapted by the Christian church. This was called a tithe and was basically a tax to support the local clergy and the facility. In England, every tenth egg, sheaf of wheat, lamb, chicken, and all other animals were given to the church as a tithe, so farm products were expected to be donated throughout the year. In France, the tithes—called la dîme—were a land and agricultural tax. The offering of first fruits was also referred to as new fruits. In French churches in the Middle Ages, new fruits were at given seasons presented at Mass for blessing. The blessed fruits were kept by the church and divided between the clergy and the poor. Similar customs during the Middle Ages could be found in all European countries. First Fruits also refers to the payment new clerics made to the bishop or the Pope of all profits from the territory the new cleric controlled. This payment was called both Annates and First Fruits. =In the Latter Day Saint movement= In the Book of Mormon, a canon of scripture used by the Latter Day Saint movement, a similar passage is found stating \\"the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise. Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God\\".

In 2004 the head of state, Hans-Adam II, publicly responded to criticism from a committee of the UN which had voiced concerns about the exclusion of women from the line of succession, stating that the rule was older than the state itself.  Succession rules  In 1606, the first prince of Liechtenstein, Karl I, and his younger brothers, Maximilian and Gundakar, signed Family Covenant, agreeing that the headship of the family should pass according to agnatic primogeniture to the heir of the most senior line. The family continued to be governed by various statutes until 1993, when it was decided that some of the provisions were outdated and that they should be amended. The statute was repealed on 26 October, and the new house law was published on 6 December. According to the house law, the right to succeed to the throne of Liechtenstein is reserved for male patrilineal descendants of Prince Johann I Joseph born to married parents, excluding issue born of marriage to which the sovereign did not consent. Should there be no more eligible male patrilineal descendants left, the sovereign has the right to adopt an heir presumptive. It is explicitly stated that if a member of the princely family adopts a prince who is in the line of succession, the adoptee's place in the line will not be altered. There is no scenario under which a woman could succeed to the throne of Liechtenstein. The house law also provides for a possibility of renunciation of succession rights.

In response to the United Nations' demands for gender equality in 2007, Prince Hans-Adam II explained that the succession law is older than the Principality of Liechtenstein itself and that it is a family tradition that does not affect the country's citizens; the Constitution of Liechtenstein stipulates that succession to the throne is a private family matter.

Hobo stoves can be functional to boil water for purification purposes during a power outage and in other survival situations, and can be used for outdoor cooking. Construction and uses A hobo stove in use This stove may be built from a discarded tin can of any size by removing the top of the can, punching several small holes near the upper edge, and a larger opening on the side of the can near the bottom, for fuel and air. The bottom of the can is generally left in place, as this yields a stronger stove structure and minimizes spread of fire to combustible material on the ground. Fuel is placed in the can and ignited. Convection draws air in through the bottom/side orifice, and heat emerges from the top. A cooking vessel may be placed on the top. The bottom/side hole may face the wind for more heat or it may be partially covered with scrap metal if the fire is too hot. The main benefit of the hobo stove is its ease of construction and versatility. The stove itself can be constructed out of a variety of materials: paint cans, coffee cans, food tins, buckets, and large drums are most often put to that purpose. Further flexibility lies in the fact that nearly anything combustible can be used as a fuel source. Typical fuels are dry twigs and small pine cones. Use of dried animal dung is also possible. Use of a Buddy Burner allows a switch to use of such less-volatile liquid fuels as rubbing alcohol or kerosene or wax. =Cautions and considerations of use= Some types of cans may have interior coatings containing chemicals such as Bisphenol A. Reusing containers originally holding paints and other types of chemicals may be injurious to the health of the user if the can is not properly cleaned and decontaminated. Caution should be used when selecting fuel. While dry twigs and other natural fuels may have low risks, the use of other materials such as pressure treated lumber may lead to exposure to carcinogens of various kinds.

Founded by 3dfx, Gemini Technology and SGI co-founders, along with former Intel and Sun Microsystems employees including Ross Q. Smith, John Archdeacon, Charles \\"Herb\\" Kuta, Dan Downum, Phil Huelson, and Dale Stimson,Quantum3D, Inc.: CEO & Executives, BusinessWeek. the company has developed a range of 3dfx and now NVIDIA-based board level and system level products for advanced, realtime 3D graphics and video intensive applications. Quantum3D was instrumental in bringing advanced graphics products to the PC-game enthusiast market (first SLI graphics boards) and for bringing PC-based, open architecture systems to both the coin-op/arcade/LBE market (Graphite ArcadePC) and to the visual and sensor simulation and training (VSST) market (AAlchemy PC-IG) for both military and commercial applications. In addition, Quantum3D has also been a pioneer in bringing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) graphics subsystems into the embedded visual computing (EVC) market for avionics, vetronics and command and control applications. Concurrent with the sale of 3dfx assets to NVIDIA in 2000, Quantum3D switched to NVIDIA as its primary graphics technology supplier. Since that date, Quantum3D has introduced a number of VSST and EVC products including the AAlchemy and Independence family of COTS image generators for flight simulation and other training applications as well as the Sentiris PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC), ExpeditionDI dismounted infantry training system, Thermite tactical visual computer and Farsight programs that have resulted in COTS technology being placed in numerous commercial and military avionics and vetronics applications. The company also has a dedicated US Federal subsidiary, CG2, which provides visual computing related services and products to the United States Department of Defense via SBIR and BAA programs.

Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). or sidas.Sida. FloraBase. Western Australian Herbarium. Description These are annual or perennial herbs or shrubs growing up to 2m tall (6 feet). Most species have hairy herbage. The leaf blades are usually unlobed with serrated edges, but may be divided into lobes. They are borne on petioles and have stipules. Flowers are solitary or arranged in inflorescences of various forms. Each has five hairy sepals and five petals in shades of yellow, orange, or white. There are many stamens and a style divided into several branches. The fruit is a disc-shaped schizocarp up to 2 cm (3/4 inch) wide which is divided into five to 12 sections, each containing one seed. The pollens are spherical in shape.The pollen grain of Genus sida Ecology Many Sida are attractive to butterflies and moths. Arrowleaf sida (Sida rhombifolia), for example, is a larval host for the Tropical Checkered Skipper (Pyrgus oileus).Sida rhombifolia. Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. University of Texas, Austin. The Sida golden mosaic virus and Sida golden yellow vein virus have been first isolated from Sida species; the former specifically from Sida santaremensis. Etymology The genus name Sida is from the Greek for \\"pomegranate or water lily\\". Carl Linnaeus adopted the name from the writings of Theophrastus. Diversity Sida has historically been a wastebasket taxon, including many plants that simply did not fit into other genera of the Malvaceae. Species have been continually reclassified. The circumscription of Sida is still unclear, with no real agreement regarding how many species belong there. Over 1000 names have been placed in the genus, and many authorities accept about 150 to 250 valid names today. Some sources accept as few as 98 species.Sida. The Plant List.

LinguaStream is developed at the GREYC (French: Groupe de recherche en informatique, image, automatique et instrumentation de Caen) computer science research group (Université de Caen) since 2001. It is available for free for private use and research purposes. Description LinguaStream allows complex processing streams to be designed and evaluated, assembling analysis components of various types and levels: part-of-speech, syntax, semantics, discourse or statistical. Each stage of the processing stream discovers and produces new information, on which the subsequent steps can rely. At the end of the stream, several tools allow analysed documents and their annotations to be conveniently visualised. LinguaStream is above all a virtual laboratory targeted to researchers in NLP. It allows for complex experiments on corpora to be realised conveniently, using various types of declarative formalisms, and reducing considerably the development costs. Its uses range from corpora exploration to the development of fully functional automatic analysers. An integrated environment is provided with the platform, where all the steps of the realisation of an experiment can be achieved. Technology As a platform, LinguaStream provides an extensive Java API. For example, it can be integrated with Java EE servers to develop web applications based on processing streams. It is also used for teaching, and provides specific modules dedicated to students. References * \\"LinguaStream: An Integrated Environment for Computational Linguistics Experimentation\\", F.

Using that collection, it is possible to derive Tsallis distributions from the optimization of the Tsallis entropic form. A continuous real parameter q can be used to adjust the distributions, so that distributions which have properties intermediate to that of Gaussian and Lévy distributions can be created. The parameter q represents the degree of non- extensivity of the distribution. Tsallis statistics are useful for characterising complex, anomalous diffusion. Tsallis functions The q-deformed exponential and logarithmic functions were first introduced in Tsallis statistics in 1994.

The film stars Dana Andrews, Joan Fontaine, Sidney Blackmer, and Arthur Franz. It was Lang's second film for producer Bert E. Friedlob, and the last American film he directed.. Plot Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer), a newspaper publisher, wants to prove a point about the inadequacy of circumstantial evidence. He talks his daughter's fiancée, Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews), into participating in a hoax, in an attempt to expose the ineptitude of the city's hard-line district attorney. The plan is for Tom to plant clues that will lead to his arrest for the murder of a female nightclub dancer, Patty Gray. Once Tom is found guilty, Spencer is to reveal the setup and humiliate the District Attorney. Tom agrees to the plan, but unforeseen events put a snag in the scheme: Spencer dies in a car accident before he can testify, and photographic evidence intended to clear Tom at his trial is burned to an unrecognizable state. Tom is found guilty and placed on death row in prison. In time to prove the two men's intentions, written testimony by the dead man is discovered. Because of this, Tom is to be pardoned. However, while talking to his fiancée Susan (Joan Fontaine), Tom slips, revealing he knows the late woman's real name; this leads him to confess. Patty Gray the murder victim, is actually Emma Blucher, Tom Garrett's estranged wife, who had reneged on her promise to divorce him in Mexico. As this was preventing Garrett from marrying Susan, he murdered Emma. Garrett's pardon is canceled before the double jeopardy rule comes into effect, and the film closes with him being led back to his cell. We are given to assume that his execution goes ahead as scheduled.

Booker states that Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is \\"perhaps the bleakest of his [Lang's] American noir films\\". Dennis L. White describes the film as having \\"considerable impact, due not so much to visual style, but as to the narrative structure and mood and to the expertly devised plot, in which the turnabout is both surprising and convincing.\\"White, Dennis L. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt article/entry, in Film Noir An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, eds. Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward (Woodstock, N.Y.: Overlook Press, 1992), p 21–22. . Stella Bruzzi, author of Men's Cinema: Masculinity and Mise-en- Scene in Hollywood, felt that the film plot was \\"overly schematic\\" and \\"motivated by a paradox\\", affecting \\"an invisible, transparent style while, at the same time, being all about surface and performance\\". She adds that Lang \\"deploys an ostentatiously unintrusive 'classical' style\\", which he \\"purposefully reduces down to its minimalist bare necessities\\". Writer James McKay notes that Fontaine as Susan Spencer is \\"a little bit more forward than we normally expect, in a role that requires her to do all the running where her man's concerned\\". Film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote a mixed review, but appreciated Lang's efforts, \\"Cheerlessly written with many plot holes, implausible contrivances and legal absurdities by law school graduate Douglas Morrow, though ably directed by film noir maven Fritz Lang (M/While the City Sleeps/Scarlet Street). Lang's last American film is a low-budget twisty courtroom drama about the dangers of capital punishment that ends up being about something more intangible--the unpredictability of fate ... But in this subversive film a perverse atmosphere of subliminal uncertainty prevails over the established surface reality, and the surprise ending comes as more of an emotional shock than as a real surprise--allowing the filmmaker to pass on his cynicism and disillusionment over the human condition. The stark, alluring and unconventional film is worth seeing for the ingenuous way it resolves the brain-teasing dilemma it raised.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

As a child he played in churches and was influenced on piano by Ramsey Lewis and then Oscar Peterson. Aspects of their styles remained in his playing, but he added the greater harmonic freedom of McCoy Tyner and others in developing as a hard bop player and then in creating his own style, which influenced others from the 1980s on. Miller's style evolved through playing with a series of major jazz figures. After leaving university he was pianist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for three years, then accompanied vocalist Betty Carter. Three-year stints with trumpeter Woody Shaw and with drummer Art Blakey's high-profile Jazz Messengers followed, by the end of which Miller had formed his own bands and begun recording under his own name. He was then part of drummer Tony Williams' quintet from its foundation, while continuing to play and record with numerous other leaders, mostly in small groups. Miller was Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University from 2005, and continued to play and tour internationally with other high-profile figures in the music until his death from a stroke at the age of 57. Early life Mulgrew Miller was born in Greenwood, Mississippi, to parents who had been raised on plantations.Bourne, Kay (November 2, 1995) \\"Musician's Musician Jazz Pianist Performs in Homage to His Roots\\".

Miller, however, played tunes on the piano from the age of six, playing by ear. He had piano lessons from the age of eight. As a child, he played blues and rhythm and blues for dances, and gospel music in a church. His family was Methodist, but he played in churches of various denominations.Mergner, Lee (January 18, 2010) \\"Mulgrew Miller to Appear with Julliard Jazz Ensemble in Celebration of MLK Day\\". JazzTimes. His principal influence on piano at this stage was Ramsey Lewis. While at high school, Miller formed a trio that played at cocktail parties. His elder brother recommended that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, but there was no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: \\"It was a life changing event. I knew right then that I would be a jazz pianist\\".\\"Mulgrew Miller\\". Allaboutjazz.com.

He played euphonium, but, during his two years at the university, Miller met pianists Donald Brown and James Williams, who introduced him to the music of well-known players such as Wynton Kelly, Bud Powell, and McCoy Tyner. Still at Memphis State, Miller attended a jazz workshop, where one of the tutors was his future bandleader, Woody Shaw, who stated that they would meet again in two years. They did meet again two years later, and Shaw remembered the young pianist. After leaving university in 1975, Miller took lessons privately in Boston with Madame Margaret Chaloff, who had taught many of the pianists that Miller admired. He later commented that, \\"I should have stayed with her longer, [...] but at that time I was so restless, constantly on the move.\\" Miller played with saxophonists Ricky Ford and Bill Pierce in Boston. That winter, Miller was invited to Los Angeles by a school friend and decided to go, to escape the northern cold. He stayed on the West Coast for a year, playing locally in clubs and a church. Later life and career =1976–86= Miller at Keystone Korner, San Francisco, in 1983 Towards the end of 1976 Miller was invited to substitute for the regular pianist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra (led by the late bandleader's son, Mercer Ellington). Miller had performed the same role for one weekend around a year earlier, and the new work was to be for only three weeks, but he ultimately toured with the orchestra for almost three years. His membership of the orchestra helped him, in the words of a piano magazine, to get \\"respect as a powerful, two-fisted pianist adept at delivering entrancingly lyrical and gracefully introspective runs as well as dazzling and buoyant passages.\\" He left in January 1980,Panken, Ted (2005) \\"Mulgrew Miller, R.I.P.

He almost never transcribed recordings (something that jazz musicians are typically taught to do); Miller credited this with slowing his learning process, but also with allowing him to express himself more freely, as he reached his own understanding of the compositions he played.

He was posthumously awarded the \\"Hero of Albania\\". Luli was the clan chieftain of the Hoti tribe. Early life Luli was born in the village of Traboin, at the time part of the Sanjak of Scutari of the Ottoman Empire (now in Podgorica, Montenegro). He belonged to the Dedvukaj family (or brotherhood) of the Hoti tribe. In the late Ottoman period, Hoti was regarded the foremost bajrak of the Malësia e Madhe region. Luli adhered to Roman Catholicism. League of Prizren A member of the League of Prizren, Ded Gjoni participated in the conflicts in Plav and Gusinje (1879–80) that resisted the decision of the Congress of Berlin (June–July 1878) to cede Ottoman territories to the Principality of Montenegro (as part of ending the Great Eastern Crisis). As the cession of Plav and Gusinje was proven impossible without bloodbath, the Ottoman Empire ceded Ulqin in January 1880 as compensation. Albanian rebellions During the Albanian revolt of 1910 and amidst the campaign by Ottoman forces to restore order in the Malësia highlands, Luli and his tribe Hoti along with the highlanders of Shalë defied the vali of Shkoder and refused to pay taxes or give up their arms. By the beginning of 1911, Roman Catholic Albanians were disturbed by the Ottoman situation in the Balkans. Montenegrin king Nikola Petrović encouraged the northern Albanian tribes (Malissori) to revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In the highlands north of Shkodër an uprising broke out by March 1911 and Luli along with his men attacked Ottoman watch-posts on the Ottoman-Montenegrin border. After having led a premature rebellion in the mountains north of Scutari in late March 1911, succeeding in capturing Tuzi, Luli was compelled by King Nikola to rally the Malissori in April. Albanian rebels and refugees from the Kosovo Vilayet had been given refuge in Montenegro. General Vukotić himself passed out weapons to them, despite the fact that Montenegro was officially neutral. Rebels were returned across the frontier, and some 8,000 men, with Montenegrin supply of arms, ammunition and advice, fought against Ottoman divisions, defeating the large contingent of Shefket Turgut Pasha several times. After the victory at Deçiq, an Albanian flag was symbolically raised on the Bratile mountain for the first time in several centuries since Ottoman occupation. Despite aiding the rebels, Nikola's strategy was to spark unrest in northern Albania and north-western Kosovo so that he could intervene and expand his borders. Legacy Dedë Gjo Luli is most known for starting the revolution for the Albanians, which eventually led to later actions by Luigj Gurakuqi, Ismail Qemali, and Isa Boletini. In Tirana, Albania's capital city, there is a street named in his honor called \\"Rruga Ded Gjo Luli\\". In the village of Bardhaj in Hot, the rubble of his house, that was left in ruins after the war, was converted into a museum which represents his life as a hero to the Albanian people. An epic poem on his 1910–11 fight against the Ottomans was recorded by Gjergj Fishta.  Death  In September 1915, Dedë Gjon Luli, roughly 75 years old, was walking along a road in Orosh, Miredite, when he was ambushed by Montenegrin forces.

This aqueduct was unlike any other of its time, being a regional network rather than being focussed on one urban centre.Historical development of the Augustan Aqueduct in Southern Italy: twenty centuries of works from Serino to Naples; G.

There were ten branches, seven of which were for cities while three were for some of the numerous luxurious villas in this area popular with rich Romans, such as the Villa Pollio at Posillipo.P. Papinius Statius, Silvae Book II: A Commentary, Harm-Jan Van Dam - 1984, Including the branches, the total length of the aqueduct was approximately , making it the longest Roman aqueduct, with the possible exception of the Gadara Aqueduct, until the 5th century AD when the Valens Aqueduct was extended in Constantinople. The Aqua Augusta was one of the most difficult and costly aqueducts ever constructed by an ancient civilisation.The Aqua Augusta and control of water resources in the Bay of Naples Duncan Keenan-Jones, Macquarie University, Australasian Society for Classical Studies Conference 31, Perth, Australia 2010 Despite its size and complexity, the Aqua Augusta is today largely unknown as a major monument because most of it is underground. The aqueduct's source, the Fons Augusteus (now known as Acquaro-Pelosi), was in the Terminio-Tuoro mountains near the modern town of Serino not far from the city of Avellino and at 376 metres above sea level. One of its main terminations was the enormous Piscina Mirabilis at the naval base and port of Misenum. Since the aqueduct traversed such a distance, many difficulties were encountered when building it: two-kilometre-long tunnels were cut through mountains, and there was ground movement near the coast due to volcanoes and a sea crossing was needed to the island of Nisida. There is evidence that a large number of private users were members of the Rome senatorial class. In Rome, a letter from the emperor was required to gain a private connection and so it seems that imperial favour was also a factor in accessing the Augusta's water. History The Piscina Mirabilis The Emperor Augustus (or more likely his close friend and ally Agrippa) had the Aqua Augusta built between 30 and 20 BC.Hodge, A.T., Roman Aqueducts & Water Supply, 2nd ed. London: Duckworth. During the war with Pompeius, Augustus ordered the construction of the Portus Julius harbour complex just west of Puteoli. Later, this harbour was seen as less ideal for the navy because of silting problems and a new major naval base was built further west at Misenum, where two lakes were connected to become the basis of the western Mediterranean war fleet. Large quantities of fresh water were needed for the base itself and for the ships, which must have been one of the reasons why Augustus had the new aqueduct built.Passchier, C.W. and Schram, W.D. (2005). Serino (Italy). Aqua Augusta The main cistern filled by the aqueduct is the Piscina Mirabilis in Misenum. Such a major monument required constant maintenance; there were major repairs in the Flavian period (1st century AD) with the addition of parallel tunnels and the Emperor Constantine also engaged in a massive restoration documented on an inscription tablet discovered in Serino and dated to AD 324. The destinations listed are: Nola, Acerrae, Atella, Naples, Pozzuoli, Baiae, Cumae, and Misenum. castellum aquae in Pompeii The cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabiae were also originally supplied by the aqueduct but being destroyed and covered by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD they did not appear on this list. The next major eruption in 472 AD left the aqueduct covered in ash and 3.5 km of the duct collapsed because of this. This cut off the supply of water to all the towns except Nola and Acerrae. The poor administrative and economic situation in Campania at this time, and Italy in general, prevented major repairs to the Augusta. Written references to aqueducts in Naples after this time only refer to other aqueducts that were now in the area. In modern times, parts of the aqueduct, in addition to the Piscina Mirabilis were vital to the region's survival during World War II. Many locals used the areas as air-raid shelters. Visible remains There are few visible remains of the aqueduct today, although much of it still exists below ground. Traces of the original structure may be found at a number of sites in and around Naples.

The activity continues in the dozen African countries which still permit big-game hunting. White hunters derived their income from organizing and leading safaris for paying clients, or from the sale of ivory. The term \\"great white hunter\\" emphasizes the racial and colonial aspects of the profession, as well as its colorful aspects. Depending on the author and intention, the term can be used straightforwardly, in parody, or as a criticism. Hunting in Africa White men from Western countries had been hunting big game in Africa throughout the 19th century, particularly in the more settled southern portion of the continent. But the region most associated with the term \\"white hunters\\" is East Africa. By the start of the 20th century, as part of the \\"scramble for Africa\\", Great Britain and Germany had taken colonial possession of territories on the eastern half of the continent--territories now recognized as the nations of Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania. There were many factors that led to the spread of big-game hunting in East Africa, but two were foremost among them: first, a romantic European conception of hunting that combined aristocratic privilege and sportsmanship, and second, the desire by the colonizing powers to create new agricultural economies, to which unchecked animal populations posed a serious threat. Although the origins of the phrase cannot be confirmed, the first European to go by the title of \\"white hunter\\" is generally considered to have been Alan Black. Black was hired in the 1890s by Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere. Delamere employed both Alan Black and a native Somali hunter to lead safaris in Somaliland. As the story goes, in order to avoid confusion, the Somali was referred to as the \\"black hunter\\", and Black was called the \\"white hunter\\".Brian Herne, White Hunters: The Golden Age of Safaris, Henry Holt & Co., 1999, pages 6-7. Rise of the hunting safari R. J. Cunninghame in 1909 Former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt's 1909 hunting trip helped popularize the African safari Around the start of the 20th century, East African hunting safaris became a fashionable pursuit among members of the privileged classes, particularly in Britain and the United States. The completion of the Uganda Railway in 1901 provided easier access to the interior highlands of British East Africa (also known then as the East African Protectorate, and now as Kenya), where large game, especially elephants, lions, Cape buffalo, and rhinoceroses, was plentiful.Peter Hathaway Capstick, Safari: The Last Adventure, St. Martin's Press, 1984, p. 9 The white hunter served these paying customers as guide, teacher, and protector.Penelope Bodry-Sanders, \\"Carl Akeley, Africa's Collector, Africa's Savior\\" Paragon House, 1990, pp. 216-217 Typically, the hunter was hired or booked by an outfitting company (the first and most famous of these was Newland, Tarlton & Co. in Nairobi); the outfitter would make the local arrangements, gathering and packing supplies and hiring the many African workers without whom a safari was impossible. Porters, tent attendants, armed guards (known as askaris), horse-trainers, and gun-bearers, all worked under the supervision of a \\"headman\\".Peter Hathaway Capstick, Safari: The Last Adventure, St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp. 11-12 Before the mass importation of motor vehicles, most safaris traveled on foot and horseback and could employ anywhere from 50 to several hundred African workers.Penelope Bodry-Sanders, \\"Carl Akeley, Africa's Collector, Africa's Savior\\" Paragon House, 1990, pp. 53-54 The British colonial government also turned big-game hunting into a source of revenue, charging the tourists and hunters licensing fees for permission to kill the game animals. In 1909, a £50 hunting license in the East Africa Protectorate entitled its purchaser to kill 2 buffaloes, 2 hippos, 1 eland, 22 zebras, 6 oryxes, 4 waterbucks, 1 Greater Kudu, 4 Lesser Kudus, 10 topis, 26 hartebeests, 229 other antelope, 84 colobus monkeys, and unlimited lions and leopards. (lions and leopards killed livestock and were classified as vermin.)Penelope Bodry-Sanders, \\"Carl Akeley, Africa's Collector, Africa's Savior\\" Paragon House, 1990, p. 114 Notable examples White hunters were colorful and romantic figures, often from privileged English backgrounds, who embraced a life of danger and adventure. The first acclaimed white hunters in East Africa were Alan Black, Bill Judd, Frederick Selous (remembered as the namesake of the Selous Scouts and whose real-life adventures inspired Sir H. Rider Haggard to create the fictional Allan Quatermain), and R.J. Cunninghame (sometimes spelled Cuningham), all of whom began their exploits at the end of the 19th century.Brian Herne, White Hunters: The Golden Age of Safaris,\\" Henry Holt & Co., 1999, pages 7-9 In 1909 Cunninghame was selected to lead what was probably the best-publicized African safari, Theodore Roosevelt's excursion into British East Africa. Roosevelt's fame and popularity, and his gift for generating publicity, prompted a craze for safaris among those who could afford the sizeable price tag.Peter Hathaway Capstick, Safari: The Last Adventure, St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp.10 After the First World War, when most of German East Africa was ceded to Britain, eager customers poured into Africa, creating a market for the skills of several more decades of hunters.William M. Adams, \\"Against Extinction,\\" Earthscan, p. 39. Among the better-known white hunters who succeeded Cunninghame's generation were W.D.M. Bell, later known as \\"Karamoja\\" Bell;Oxfordjournals.org Bror von Blixen- Finecke, who was, between 1914 and 1926, married to Out of Africa author Karen Blixen; Denys Finch-Hatton, later her lover; Frederick Russell Burnham, Chief of Scouts in the Second Boer War to (Lord Roberts and known as \\"England's American Scout\\"; John A. Hunter; and Philip Percival and Frank M. \\"Bunny\\" Allen, whose safaris with Ernest Hemingway led the author to write Green Hills of Africa, True at First Light, The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, and The Snows of Kilimanjaro. Representations in literature and film The exploits of white hunters were subjects first for novels and later for films. They were romanticized in adventure novels of the so-called \\"Lost World/Lost Race\\" genre. \\"BY THE IMPERIAL noonday, then, the spectacle of the Empire was flamboyant indeed, coloured as much by Oriental despotism and barbaric gesture as by feudal example from nearer home. If it was modernist in some ways, it was antique in others. It embodied the marvellous energy of steam as well as the immemorial pride of horseflesh. It was queenly, but it was savage. It was partly the consequence of dukes, but partly the beat of jungle drums, and Imperial activists of every kind were recruited willy-nilly into its presentation: bishops beside viceroys, police officers and railwaymen, even sportsmen, foresters, jute merchants, river pilots or colonial accountants - all of whom, by their bearing, their demeanour or their costume, their pose at the wicket, the flutter of their gowns, the gravity of their presence behind the study desk or board-room table, contributed to the Imperial effect.\\" Perhaps the first fictional Victorian adventure hero was Allan Quatermain, a white hunter who appeared in books by H. Rider Haggard, starting with King Solomon's Mines (1885). In 1924, Richard Connell published his short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", in which an American big-game hunter finds himself being hunted by a Russian aristocrat who has tired of hunting in Africa; the story is still widely read. Alex Raymond created the Jungle Jim comic strip in 1934 that later lead to a comic book, film serial, film series, and television show. Geoffrey Household's novel Rogue Male (1939) featured a white hunter going after Adolf Hitler; it was filmed twice, first as Man Hunt (1941) and, a generation later, under the original title (1976). Captain CG Biggar, a supporting character in the P. G. Wodehouse comic novel Ring for Jeeves (1953), is another example of the white hunter. Not surprisingly, actual white hunters were often involved in the filming of the exploits of their fictional counterparts: Bunny Allen led many film companies on safari to enable location filming for King Solomon's Mines, Mogambo (1953), and Nor the Moon by Night (1958). The white hunter on safari in his khakis and pith helmet became an instantly recognizable stock character. Abbott and Costello lampooned the type in Africa Screams (1949), which was a parody of a 1930 documentary, Africa Speaks! (1930). Bob Hope parodied the safari genre in Road to Zanzibar (1941) and Call Me Bwana (1963). Hemingway's safari story, \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" (1936), richly addresses the questions of courage, cowardice, racism, and power on safari. The story was made into a film titled The Macomber Affair (1947), but it was reissued in the United States under the title, The Great White Hunter. The title character is an American tourist looking to find his own courage by facing danger on safari. In the story, Hemingway accurately refers to the professional hunter leading the safari, a character named Wilson, as a \\"white hunter\\". (Wilson is said to have been based on Hemingway's own guides, Philip Percival and Bror von Blixen- Finecke).Baker, Carlos, Ernest Hemingway, A Life Story, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969, pp. 284-285 The addition of \\"great\\" in the movie release title may have helped to lodge the ironic use of the phrase in the popular culture. Clint Eastwood's film, White Hunter, Black Heart (1990) presents clear examples of this type, both in the professional hunters leading John Wilson in to the bush and in the director's passion to be such a hunter. In Congo (film) (1995), Ernie Hudson introduces himself as the unexpectedly black \\"white hunter\\" hired to guide a jungle expedition. Origins The phrase \\"great white hunter\\" probably has its origins in these popular depictions of safari adventures. Peter Capstick, a white hunter and an author of books on the subject, suggested that the word \\"great\\" may have been added by American popular culture.Peter Hathaway Capstick, SAFARI: The Last Adventure, St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp. 132-133 It was not a term employed or embraced by the hunters themselves.

Its subject is the automated detection of transitions between shots in digital video with the purpose of temporal segmentation of videos.  Use  Shot transition detection is used to split up a film into basic temporal units called shots; a shot is a series of interrelated consecutive pictures taken contiguously by a single camera and representing a continuous action in time and space. This operation is of great use in software for post-production of videos. It is also a fundamental step of automated indexing and content-based video retrieval or summarization applications which provide an efficient access to huge video archives, e.g. an application may choose a representative picture from each scene to create a visual overview of the whole film and, by processing such indexes, a search engine can process search items like \\"show me all films where there's a scene with a lion in it.\\" Cut detection can do nothing that a human editor couldn't do manually, however it is advantageous as it saves time. Furthermore, due to the increase in the use of digital video and, consequently, in the importance of the aforementioned indexing applications, the automatic cut detection is very important nowadays.  Basic technical terms  An Abrupt Transition. The dissolve blends one shot gradually into another with a transparency effect. In simple terms cut detection is about finding the positions in a video in that one scene is replaced by another one with different visual content. Technically speaking the following terms are used: A digital video consists of frames that are presented to the viewer's eye in rapid succession to create the impression of movement. \\"Digital\\" in this context means both that a single frame consists of pixels and the data is present as binary data, such that it can be processed with a computer. Each frame within a digital video can be uniquely identified by its frame index, a serial number. A shot is a sequence of frames shot uninterruptedly by one camera. There are several film transitions usually used in film editing to juxtapose adjacent shots; In the context of shot transition detection they are usually group into two types: * Abrupt Transitions - This is a sudden transition from one shot to another, i. e. one frame belongs to the first shot, the next frame belongs to the second shot. They are also known as hard cuts or simply cuts. *Gradual Transitions - In this kind of transitions the two shots are combined using chromatic, spatial or spatial-chromatic effects which gradually replace one shot by another. These are also often known as soft transitions and can be of various types, e.g., wipes, dissolves, fades... \\"Detecting a cut\\" means that the position of a cut is gained; more precisely a hard cut is gained as \\"hard cut between frame i and frame i+1\\", a soft cut as \\"soft cut from frame i to frame j\\". A transition that is detected correctly is called a hit, a cut that is there but was not detected is called a missed hit and a position in that the software assumes a cut, but where actually no cut is present, is called a false hit. An introduction to film editing and an exhaustive list of shot transition techniques can be found at film editing.  Vastness of the problem  Although cut detection appears to be a simple task for a human being, it is a non-trivial task for computers. Cut detection would be a trivial problem if each frame of a video was enriched with additional information about when and by which camera it was taken. Possibly no algorithm for cut detection will ever be able to detect all cuts with certainty, unless it is provided with powerful artificial intelligence. While most algorithms achieve good results with hard cuts, many fail with recognizing soft cuts. Hard cuts usually go together with sudden and extensive changes in the visual content while soft cuts feature slow and gradual changes. A human being can compensate this lack of visual diversity with understanding the meaning of a scene. While a computer assumes a black line wiping a shot away to be \\"just another regular object moving slowly through the on-going scene\\", a person understands that the scene ends and is replaced by a black screen.  Methods  Each method for cut detection works on a two-phase-principle: # Scoring – Each pair of consecutive frames of a digital video is given a certain score that represents the similarity/dissimilarity between them. # Decision – All scores calculated previously are evaluated and a cut is detected if the score is considered high. This principle is error prone. First, because even minor exceedings of the threshold value produce a hit, it must be ensured that phase one scatters values widely to maximize the average difference between the score for \\"cut\\" and \\"no cut\\". Second, the threshold must be chosen with care; usually useful values can be gained with statistical methods. Cut detection. (1) Hit: a detected hard cut. (2) Missed hit: a soft cut (dissolve), that was not detected. (3) False Hit: one single soft cut that is falsely interpreted as two different hard cuts. = Scoring = There are many possible scores used to access the differences in the visual content; some of the most common are: * Sum of absolute differences (SAD). This is both the most obvious and most simple algorithm of all: The two consecutive frames are compared pixel by pixel, summing up the absolute values of the differences of each two corresponding pixels. The result is a positive number that is used as the score. SAD reacts very sensitively to even minor changes within a scene: fast movements of the camera, explosions or the simple switching on of a light in a previously dark scene result in false hits. On the other hand, SAD hardly reacts to soft cuts at all. Yet, SAD is used often to produce a basic set of \\"possible hits\\" as it detects all visible hard cuts with utmost probability. * Histogram differences (HD). Histogram differences is very similar to Sum of absolute differences. The difference is that HD computes the difference between the histograms of two consecutive frames; a histogram is a table that contains for each color within a frame the number of pixels that are shaded in that color. HD is not as sensitive to minor changes within a scene as SAD and thus produces less false hits. One major problem of HD is that two images can have exactly the same histograms while the shown content differs extremely, e. g. a picture of the sea and a beach can have the same histogram as one of a corn field and the sky. HD offers no guarantee that it recognizes hard cuts. * Edge change ratio (ECR). The ECR attempts to compare the actual content of two frames. It transforms both frames to edge pictures, i. e. it extracts the probable outlines of objects within the pictures (see edge detection for details). Afterwards it compares these edge pictures using dilation to compute a probability that the second frame contains the same objects as the first frame. The ECR is one of the best performing algorithms for scoring. It reacts very sensitively to hard cuts and can detect many soft cuts by nature. In its basic form even ECR cannot detect soft cuts such as wipes as it considers the fading-in objects as regular objects moving through the scene. Yet, ECR can be extended manually to recognize special forms of soft cuts. Finally, a combination of two or more of these scores can improve the performance. = Decision = In the decision phase the following approaches are usually used: * Fixed Threshold – In this approach, the scores are compared to a threshold which was set previously and if the score is higher than the threshold a cut is declared. * Adaptive Threshold – In this approach, the scores are compared to a threshold which considers various scores in the video to adapt the threshold to the properties of the current video. Like in the previous case, if the score is higher than the corresponding threshold a cut is declared. * Machine Learning - Machine learning techniques can be applied also to the decision process.  Cost  All of the above algorithms complete in O(n) — that is to say they run in linear time — where n is the number of frames in the input video. The algorithms differ in a constant factor that is determined mostly by the image resolution of the video.  Measures for quality  Usually the following three measures are used to measure the quality of a cut detection algorithm: * Recall is the probability that an existing cut will be detected: V = {C \\\\over C + M} * Precision is the probability that an assumed cut is in fact a cut: P = {C \\\\over C + F} * F1 is a combined measure that results in high value if, and only if, both precision and recall result in high values: F1={2 * P * V \\\\over P + V} The symbols stand for: C, the number of correctly detected cuts (\\"correct hits\\"), M, the number of not detected cuts (\\"missed hits\\") and F, the number of falsely detected cuts (\\"false hits\\"). All of these measures are mathematical measures, i. e. they deliver values in between 0 and 1. The basic rule is: the higher the value, the better performs the algorithm.

The basin covers an area of approximately , one-fourth of which is covered by saline lakes and playas. Around one third of the basin, about , is desert. Name Tshwa'i 'Dam is the Wylie romanization of the Tibetan name , meaning \\"Salt Marsh\\"; the Tibetan Pinyin romanization of the same name is Caidam. Qaidam is the GNC romanization of its transcription into Mongolian; Tsaidamchina.org.cn - Salt lakes is a variant romanization of the same name. Chaidamu is the pinyin romanization of its transcription into Chinese characters; the same name was formerly romanized as the for the Chinese Postal Map. Geography Orographically, the Qaidam Basin is a comparatively low area in the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau.. With an elevation of around , Qaidam forms a kind of shelf between Tibet to the south (around ) and Gansu to the north (around ). A low water divide separates the Qaidam Basin proper from that of Qinghai Lake to the east. Despite this lower elevation, Qaidam is still high enough that its mean annual temperature is despite lying on the same latitude as Algeria, Greece, and Virginia in the United States. The crescent-shaped basin covers an area of approximately . Its substrate is broadly divided into three blocks: the Mangya Depression, a northern fault zone, and the Sanhu Depression. Qaidam is an intermontane basin, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges. In the south, the Kunlun Mountains separate it from the higher central section of the Tibetan Plateau. In the north, a number of smaller ridges like the Shulenanshan separate it from another higher plateau, which usually referenced by the name of its northern escarpment, the Qilian or Nanshan. In the northwest, the Altyn-Tagh separates it from the Kumtagh Desert of southeastern Xinjiang. Yardangs (\\"yadans\\") in the Qaidam Desert. Because of this position, Qaidam forms an endorheic basin accumulating lakes with no outlet to the sea. The area is among the most arid non-polar locations on earth, with some places reporting an aridity index of 0.008–0.04. Across the entire basin, the mean annual rainfall is but the mean annual evaporation is . Because of the low rainfall, these lakes have become saline or dried up completely. Presently, there are four main playas in the basin: Qarhan in the southeast and (from north to south) Kunteyi, Chahanshilatu, and Dalangtan in the northwest. These playas and a few other saline lakes occupy over one-fourth of the basin, with the sediments deposited since the Jurassic as deep as 10 to 14 km (6–9mi) in places despite tectonic activity having repeatedly shifted the center of the region's sedimentation. The seasonal nature and commercial exploitation of some of the lakes makes an exact count problematic: one count reckoned there were 27 lakes in the basin,. another reckoned 43 with a total area of .. The aridity, salinity, wide diurnal and seasonal temperature swings, and relatively high ultraviolet radiation has led to Qaidam being studied by the China Geological Survey as a Mars analogue for use in testing spectroscopy and equipment for China's 2020 Mars rover program. Geological history Qaidam was part of the North China Craton from at least 1 billion years ago, before breaking off million years ago at the end of the Neoproterozoic. It was an island in a shallow sea until uplift beginning around 400Ma finally rejoined it to the mainland by 200Ma. Three-dimensional modeling shows that the present basin has been squeezed to an irregular diamond shape since the beginning of the Cenozoic, with the Indian Plate beginning to impact the ancient Tibetan shoreline somewhere between 55–35Ma. At first, Qaidam was at a far lower elevation. Pollen found in core samples shows that the Oligocene (34–23Ma) was relatively humid. A great lake slowly formed in the western basin, which two major tectonic movements raised and cut off from its original sources of sediment. At its greatest extent during the Miocene (23–5Ma), this lake spread at the present elevation contour over . and was among the largest lakes in the world. Nutrient-rich inflows contributed to plankton blooms, which supported an ecosystem that built up reserves of organic carbon. The Tibetan plateau's uplift, however, eventually cut it off from the warm and humid Indian monsoon. It went from a forest steppe to a desert. By 12Ma, the climate had dried enough to break Qaidam's single lake into separate basins, which frequently became saline. During the Pliocene (5–2.5Ma), the focus of most sedimentation was at what is now Kunteyi but, during the Pleistocene (after 2.5Ma), tectonic activity shifted the basin's tributaries and floor, moving the focus of sedimentation from the Dalangtan to Qarhan area. During this time, the record's glacial intervals suggest a low- temperature climate and its sandstone yardangs attest to strong winds. From 770,000 and 30,000 years ago, the enormous lake which filled much of the southeastern basin alternated nine times between being a fresh- and saltwater lake. Pollen studies suggest the bed of Dabusun Lake in the Qarhan Playanearly the lowest point of the basinwas elevated about within the last 500,000 years. At around 30 kya, this greatat the time, freshwaterlake spread over at least with a surface above the present levels of its successors. At the same time, a river from the \\"Kunlun\\" paleolake to its south was enriching the Sanhu region with enormous reserves of lithium derived from hot springs near Mount Buka Daban which now feed into the Narin Gol River that flows into East Taijinar Lake. Around 30 kya, the lake in the Kunluns dried up and the Qarhan was cut off from sufficient inflows of fresh water. It became saline again, beginning to precipitate salts about 25,000 years ago.. The basin's continuing formation and evolution is controlled by the Altyn Tagh fault constituting the northern basin boundary. Resources The Sanhu Depression in SE Qaidam (2014). The two Taijinar lakes lie to the northwest and the lakes of the Qarhan Playa to the southeast. (ESA) A salt mine in the Qaidam Desert The basin's large mineral deposits caused a great deal of investment interest from 2005. Qarhan Playa, a salt flat including about ten of the lakes, contains over 50 billion metric tons (55 billion short tons) of salt. Beneath the salt, Qaidam is one of China's nine most important petroliferous basins and its largest center of onshore production. The Qinghai Oilfield, exploited since 1954, includes the Lenghu, Gasikule, Yuejin-2, and Huatugou oil fields and the Sebei-1, Sebei-2, and Tainan gas fields. All together, it has proven reserves of 347.65 million metric tons (more than 2 billion barrels) of petroleum and 306.6 billion cubic meters (10.83 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas. Annual production capacity is about 2 million metric tons of petroleum and 8.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas. A pipeline connects the Huatugou field with the major refinery at Golmud, and the Sebei gas fields are connected to Xining, Lanzhou, and Yinchuan. Qaidam has reserves of asbestos, borax, gypsum, and several metals, with the greatest reserves of lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium of anywhere in China. Transportation The Xining-Golmud rail line (the first stage of the Qinghai–Tibet Railway), which crossed the eastern part of the Qaidam Basin in the early 1980s, is an essential transportation link for accessing the region's mineral resources.

The McCarran–Ferguson Act was passed by the 79th Congress in 1945 after the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association that the federal government could regulate insurance companies under the authority of the Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution and that the federal antitrust laws applied to the insurance industry. The Act was sponsored by Senators Pat McCarran (D-Nev.) and Homer Ferguson (R-Mich.). Overview The McCarran–Ferguson Act does not itself regulate insurance, nor does it mandate that states regulate insurance. It provides that \\"Acts of Congress\\" which do not expressly purport to regulate the \\"business of insurance\\" will not preempt state laws or regulations that regulate the \\"business of insurance.\\" Specifically with respect to federal antitrust laws it exempts the \\"business of insurance\\" as long as the state regulates in that area, with the proviso that cases of boycott, coercion, and intimidation remain prohibited regardless of state regulation. By contrast, most other federal laws will not apply to insurance whether the states regulate in that area or not. Background of state regulation of insurance Until the middle of the 19th century insurance largely went unregulated in the United States. New Hampshire in 1850 was the first state to appoint an insurance commissioner. In 1852, Massachusetts appointed a commission and California, Connecticut, Indiana, Missouri, New York and Vermont either established a separate insurance department or vested the power to regulate insurance in an existing agency. Shortly thereafter, other states followed until by 1871 nearly every state had \\"some type of supervision and control over insurance companies.\\" Often the legislation and rules promulgated by insurance commissions of one state conflicted with those of others. And in some cases the rules that applied to out-of-state insurers deprived them of substantial rights. For example, one state required out-of- state insurers to post a bond that it would not appeal any case to the United States Supreme Court. Insurers early attempted to oust states from regulation by using the constitutional argument that the business of insurance amounted to \\"Commerce …among the several states\\" and by virtue of the Commerce Clause of the federal constitution, regulation of it was exclusively given to the federal government. The United States Supreme Court first decided a case on this basis in 1868 rejecting the argument of the insurers in the context of an out-of-state insurer selling policies in another statePaul v. Virginia, 8 Wall 163, 183 (1868). For over 75 years the Supreme Court rejected insurers' attempt to avoid state regulation on this basis. History In 1942, at the request of the Attorney General of Missouri (whose insurance regulators felt powerless to correct abuses they had identified since 1922), the Department of Justice investigated and a grand jury in Georgia indicted the South-Eastern Underwriters Association, 27 of its officers and 198 member companies. The indictment charged the defendants with two counts of antitrust violations: (1) conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act to fix the premium rates on certain fire insurance policies and boycott non-complying independent sales agencies that did not comply; and (2) monopolization of markets for the sale of fire insurance policies in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The district court sustained the defendants' demurrer and dismissed the indictment, holding that \\"the business of insurance is not commerce, either intrastate or interstate\\" and that it \\"is not interstate commerce or interstate trade, though it might be considered a trade subject to local laws either State or Federal, where the commerce clause is not the authority relied upon.\\"United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, 51 F. Supp. 712, 713, 714 (N.D. Ga. 1944). In January 1955 the Supreme Court heard arguments on the prosecutors' appeal from the district court. The question in the case, as formulated by the Court itself, was \\"whether the Commerce Clause grants to Congress the power to regulate insurance transactions stretching across state lines.\\" For nearly 80 years before then, the Supreme Court had consistently held that \\"Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce,\\" \\"the business of insurance is not commerce,\\"Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 655 (1895). and \\"contracts of insurance are not commerce at all, neither state nor interstate.\\"New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, 231 U.S. 495, 510 (1913). Those cases, however, dealt with the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, i.e., whether the business was \\"interstate commerce\\" such that it could not be regulated by the individual states.; The South-Eastern Underwriters case, however, involved the question whether the business of insurance was \\"interstate commerce\\" sufficient to allow Congressional regulation. The Supreme Court in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, 322 U.S. 533 (1944), 4-3 decision written by Justice Hugo Black, reversed the district court, holding that (1) the Sherman Act intended to cover the alleged acts of monopolization; and (2) that the transaction of insurance across state lines was \\"commerce among the states\\" which the Constitution permitted Congress to regulate. The three judges who dissented did so for separate reasons. Chief Justice Stone argued that the writing of insurance in one state to cover risk in another was not \\"interstate commerce\\" as a constitutional matter and that the actions charged were not within the purview of the Sherman Act. His opinion was largely based on the previous decision of the Court on the negative implications of the Commerce Clause.322 U.S. at 562–84. Justice Jackson, in addition to concurring with the Chief Justice, urged the impracticality of allowing both state and federal regulation of insurance and given the precedent believed that it should be done by the states, at least absent a specific declaration by Congress.322 U.S. at 584–95. Justice Frankfurter allowed that Congress's power under the Commerce Clause reached these actions but argued that the Sherman Act was not an express warrant that Congress intended to enter this area of commerce.322 U.S. at 584. Legislative history Since the Paul case in 1868, it had been widely believed that the federal government was excluded from regulating the insurance industry. Before the South-Eastern Underwriters Association case, \\"insurance already was one of the most highly regulated industries in the American economy,\\" with every state having an insurance department and detailed laws on protection of policy holders in case of insolvency. But regulation of other aspects of insurance varied widely among the states. The prospect of a federal take-over of insurance regulation, alarmed state regulators and thirty five states had filed amicus curiae briefs supporting the decision of the district court.322 U.S. at 595 n.18. State insurance regulators and insurance executives complained to Congress that the decision would upset the extensive system of state regulation and taxation (as Justice Jackson had warned), even though Attorney General Biddle denied any such intent. In response to this decision, on March 9, 1945, the Congress passed the McCarran–Ferguson Act, which, among other things: * partially exempts insurance companies from the federal anti-trust legislation that applies to most businesses * allows states to regulate insurance * allows states to establish mandatory licensing requirements * preserves certain state laws of insurance. Significance to U.S. health care reform in the 21st century One aspect of Republican proposals for healthcare reform in the United States is allowing interstate competition for health insurance, potentially requiring modification of the McCarran–Ferguson Act. In February 2010, the House of Representatives voted 406-19 to repeal the McCarran–Ferguson Act with regard to health insurance.

Dysferlin is linked with skeletal muscle repair. A defect in the DYSF gene, located on chromosome 2p12-14, results in several types of muscular dystrophy; including Miyoshi myopathy (MM), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Distal Myopathy (DM). A reduction or absence of dysferlin, termed dysferlinopathy, usually becomes apparent in the third or fourth decade of life and is characterised by weakness and wasting of various voluntary skeletal muscles.Leiden University Medical Center, Center for Human and Clinical Genetics - Dysferlin Retrieved 21 June 2007.  Structure  The human dysferlin protein is a 237 kilodalton type-II transmembrane protein. It contains a large intracellular cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, an extreme C-terminal transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular domain. The cytosolic domain of dysferlin is composed of seven highly conserved C2 domains (C2A-G) which are conserved across several proteins within the ferlin family, including dysferlin homolog myoferlin. In fact, the C2 domain at any given position is more similar to the C2 domain at the corresponding position within other ferlin family members than the adjacent C2 domain within the same protein. This suggests that each individual C2 domain may in fact play a specific role in dysferlin function. A crystal structure of the C2A domain of human dysferlin has been solved, and reveals that the C2A domain changes conformation when interacting with calcium ions, which is consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that the C2A domain plays a role in calcium-dependent lipid binding. In addition to the C2 domains, dysferlin also contains \\"FerA\\" and \\"DysF\\" domains. Mutations in both FerA and DysF can cause muscular dystrophies. DysF domain has an interesting structure as in contains one DysF domain within another DysF domain, a result of gene duplication; however, the function of this domain is currently unknown. FerA domain is conserved among all members of ferlin protein family. There has been two single point mutations in dysferlin FerA domain that have been associated with muscular dystrophy. FerA domain is a four helix bundle and it can interact with membrane, usually in a calcium- dependent manner.  Function  The most intensively studied role for dysferlin is in a cellular process called membrane repair. Membrane repair is a critical mechanism by which cells are able to seal dramatic wounds to the plasma membrane. Muscle is thought to be particularly prone to membrane wounds given that muscle cells transmit high force and undergo cycles of contraction. Dysferlin is highly expressed in muscle, and is homologous to the ferlin family of proteins, which are thought to regulate membrane fusion across a wide variety of species and cell types. Several lines of evidence suggest that dysferlin may be involved in membrane repair in muscle. First, dysferlin- deficient muscle fibers show accumulation of vesicles (which are critical for membrane repair in non-muscle cell types) near membrane lesions, indicating that dysferlin may be required for fusion of repair vesicles with the plasma membrane. Further, dysferlin-deficient muscle fibers take up extracellular dyes to a greater extent than wild-type muscle fibers following laser-induced wounding in-vitro. Dysferlin is also markedly enriched at membrane lesions with several additional proteins thought to be involved in membrane resealing, including annexin and MG53. Exactly how dysferlin contributes to membrane resealing is not clear, but biochemical evidence indicates that dysferlin may bind lipids in a calcium-dependent manner, consistent with a role for dysferlin in regulating fusion of repair vesicles with the sarcolemma during membrane repair. Furthermore, live-cell imaging of dysferlin-eGFP expressing myotubes indicates that dysferlin localizes to a cellular compartment that responds to injury by forming large dysferlin-containing vesicles, and formation of these vesicles may contribute to wound repair. Dysferlin may also be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.  Interactions  Dysferlin has been shown to interact with Caveolin 3 in skeletal muscle, and this interaction is thought to retain dysferlin within the plasma membrane. Dysferlin also interacts with MG53, and a functional interaction between dysferlin, caveolin-3 and MG53 is thought to be critical for membrane repair in skeletal muscle.

The regiment would see action in the Invasion of Canada, New York Campaign, Battle of Saratoga, Battle of Monmouth and the Sullivan Expedition. The regiment was merged into the 2nd NY on January 1, 1781. Initial organization After the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga on May 10, 1775 by Ethan Allen, it became apparent that it was unlikely to be a peaceful settlement with Britain in the foreseeable future. On May 25th, the Continental Congress, requested New England and New York to raise troops for a campaign into Canada. The New York Provincial Congress authorized the raising of four Regiments totaling 3,000 soldiers to serve under the command of major general Philip Schuyler until December 31. Schuyler was in charge of the troops in New York, which constituted the North Department. Former British officer Richard Montgomery was named brigadier general. It was anticipated the Montgomery's combat experience would complement Schuyler administrative and logistical skills.Wright Jr., Robert K., The Continental Army, Chap.2, Center for Military History, US Army, 1983 The 1st New York Regiment, under the command of Colonel Alexander McDougall was raised in New York City; the 2nd New York Regiment, under Colonel Goose Van Schaick at Albany; the 3rd New York Regiment, under Colonel James Clinton from the west bank of the Hudson; and , the 4th, under Colonel James Holmes from the east side of the river. While Washington dealt with the British in Boston, Schuyler was to undertake an invasion of Canada. The troops were to receive uniforms in Albany, but the Provisional Congress overestimated the merchants' available stock of cloth required, and having headed north so soon after forming, there were only enough for the first two regiments raised. The 4th received only regimental short coats. In August 1775, Philip Van Cortlandt described many of the men of the 4th wanting shirts, shoes, stockings, underclothes, and, in short, without anything fit for a soldier except a uniform coat.\\"Colonel James Holmes' Fourth New York Regiment\\", fortticonderoga.org Arming the troops also proved challenging. More of the muskets, bayonets, ramrods, etc. had been supplied to the 1st and 2nd, leaving Holmes without enough to supply a company. The colony did not have sufficient material to supply so many soldiers. Washington assigned colonel Henry Knox to retrieve the British artillery from Ticonderoga and bring it to Boston. He wrote that \\"no trouble or expense must be spared to obtain them.\\"Ware, Susan (2000). Forgotten Heroes: Inspiring American Portraits from Our Leading Historians. Portland, OR: Simon and Schuster. p. 19. On November 16, Washington wrote to Schuyler requesting that he assist Knox in the endeavor.Brooks, Victor (1999). The Boston Campaign. Conshohocken, PA: Combined Publishing, p.38. The 4th, the least equipped regiment, was posted along an area from Albany to Lake George (New York) to maintain essential lines for supplies and communication. Those at Ticonderoga provided the main manpower to enable Knox to move the cannons and munitions. During the Invasion of Quebec in late 1775, General Schuyler became too ill to continue and turned command of the expedition over to Montgomery. Montgomery was killed during an assault on Quebec City in December 1775. The second establishment of the regiment was authorized on January 19, 1776.Wright, pg. 60 Saratoga Array of Units on the Freeman's Farm Battlefield In August 1777, the 4th New York, which was under Colonel Henry Beekman Livingston, was attached to Enoch Poor's brigade at Loudon's Ferry, not far from Van Schaick Island. By mid- September, they were at Saratoga, where they came to the aid of Daniel Morgan's rifleman at Freeman's Farm on September 19.Luzader, John F. Saratoga: A Military History of the Decisive Campaign of the American Revolution. New York: Savas Beatie. p. 240 On October 7, they were in General Gates' left wing. The regiment spent the following winter at Valley Forge. Coming out of winter quarters, the Americans met the British at Monmouth Courthouse in June 1778. The 4th regiment, still part of Poor's brigade, was put in the main line of defense, while Col. Beekman was detached to lead a hand-picked battalion in the vanguard. Frederick von Weissenfels Frederick, Baron de Weissenfels became Lt. Colonel Commanding of the 4th New York on January 13, 1779, and remained in that post until the unit was reduced by the State of New York on January 1, 1780. The 4th New York was known during the war as Weissenfel's Regiment.

Wesley is a longtime client of Iverson and LeBron James's agent, the Philadelphia attorney Leon Rose. One of hip hop's biggest contemporary artists, Drake, gives Wesley a shout out on his popular diss track Back to Back, stating \\"I learned the game from William Wesley, you could never check me,\\" (the first verse in the song) exposing Wesley to a new audience. Wes was also referenced in Jay-Z's verse in the song Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2. Shaquille O'Neal references Wesley in his song \\"LaVar Ball Diss Track\\". Early years Wesley was born in Camden, New Jersey. He played high school basketball for Pennsauken High School in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. Playing for rival Camden High School was Milt Wagner, who later went on to the University of Louisville and the NBA. Wagner claims that Wesley became his friend and confidant during high school, and that he introduced Wesley to Michael Jordan, among other pro basketball luminaries. Around the same time, Leon Rose played basketball for nearby Cherry Hill High School East in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. In 2005 Rose acknowledged having been Wesley's attorney \\"for 21 years.\\" In the early 1980s, Wesley worked as a salesperson at Pro Shoes Inc., an elite sneaker company, specializing in high-end basketball shoes, across the street from the Cherry Hill Mall. Wesley attended Brandywine College (now called Widener University) in Chester, Pennsylvania for one year. Involvement with current players and coaches Wesley is involved with The Family, a Detroit-area youth basketball team supported by former Detroit Pistons guard Richard Hamilton, and counts among his closest friends Hamilton, Iverson, and Dajuan Wagner, the son of Milt Wagner and a first-round pick in the 2002 NBA Draft.

At present the series consists of eight books and, although there was a significant gap between the writing of book six and book seven, it seems unlikely that any more will be written. These volumes are: * Spellsinger (1983) * The Hour of the Gate (1984) * The Day of the Dissonance (1984) * The Moment of the Magician (1984) * The Paths of the Perambulator (1985) * The Time of the Transference (1987) * Son of Spellsinger (1993) * Chorus Skating (1994) Background The story initially deals with the characters of Jonathan Thomas Meriweather, referred to by the locals as Jon-Tom, when he is unwillingly pulled into a fantasy world by the turtle wizard Clothahump. Having been, at the moment of his transportation, high on cannabis, Jon-Tom initially thinks it is all a dream brought on by the drugs. He soon finds out differently: he is in an unfamiliar world with little prospect of returning home anytime soon. The world of Spellsinger is largely inhabited by animals that are similar to those found on Earth, but are anthropomorphic: generally bipedal, they are intelligent, able to wear clothing and handle tools, generally closer to human-sized than their Earth counterparts, and are capable of speech. Humans, far from being the dominant species, here are equal to others. The threat to the Western areas are from the Plated Folk, larger versions of insects and other arthropods who periodically mount assaults on the Western areas. Spiders are not included in the main society, which has centipedes and various insects like beetles. Spiders have their own society known as The Weavers, and are highly isolationist. Main characters Many of the primary characters in each of the books only appear for that volume; however, there are a number of characters who appear in the majority of the series. Jon-Tom Jonathan Thomas Meriweather, called 'Jon-Tom,' is a student in law at UCLA who is pulled through to this world from Earth by the wizard Clothahump. Since Jon-Tom is high on hallucinogenic drugs at the time, he initially believes that he is dreaming. This belief is soon dispelled when Mudge the Otter stabs him. Mudge, who considers Jonathon Thomas' full name to be too long-winded, nicknames him Jon-Tom. Jon-Tom is an easygoing person, a bit naive, and also someone who seems to look for the best in people. His social skills seem a bit awkward, especially in Mudge's world, and he initially makes a few faux-pas. His main advantage is that he discovers he is able to wield the power of a spellsinger, a mage who can use songs to cast spells. Unfortunately, he has considerable difficulty learning to control the magic and the results are somewhat unpredictable, but usually still useful. For instance, in a duel with another spellsinger, Jon-Tom sings \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,\\" expecting a horde of minions to attack his opponent, but his opponent comments how he barely warded off getting his throat cut instead. Mudge Mudge is an otter who appears to be an anti-hero in the series due to him being a womanizer, a thief, an alcoholic and a gambler. He also does not take life seriously at all. These traits seem to be common to the otter species in the Spellsinger world, but Mudge takes it to the extreme. He initially encounters Jon-Tom after more or less colliding with him. It is Mudge who convinces Jon-Tom that he is not dreaming by stabbing him with a sword. Despite the fact that he and Jon-Tom had a shaky start, ultimately the duo slowly became close friends through their adventures (though in most books Mudge ends up going unwillingly at the start). Talea Talea is an old acquaintance of Mudge and also happens to have the same profession. She is a human with red hair and green eyes. While she can tolerate Mudge, she finds his lecherous attitude disgusting. She is quick with sword and tongue. She often disagrees with Jon-Tom due to his naïve outlook; this leads to a number of fights between them. Clothahump The old turtle wizard Clothahump brings Jon-Tom to his world while casting a spell seeking an otherworldly wizard to help save his own world. His magic sought to bring an \\"engineer\\" to his world, and he got what he was seeking in Jon-Tom: a part-time janitor or \\"Sanitation Engineer.\\" He is notoriously manipulative of his associates, albeit in the service of benign intentions. Weegee A female otter whom Mudge falls in love with. Buncan Jon-Tom and Talea's son. Wants to be a spellsinger yet his singing is horrible, to the point he accidentally summons evil spirits into the house constantly. Squill, Nickum (males) Neena/Noctor, and Picket (females) Picket and Nickum appear in book six, Squill and Neena are first named in book seven, and are Mudge and Weegee's four children. In book eight Neena was retconned to her name being Noctor. Squill and Neena are tough teenagers who take after Mudge very closely and are Buncan's closest friend. They are decent singers, so they spellsing for Buncan while he plays, making them a musical trio. Picket and Nickum are never mentioned after book six. Secondary characters These characters appear in only one or two volumes, though they do play major parts in those stories. Falameezar-aziz-Sulmonmee Falameezar is a Marxist dragon originally enlisted to aid Jon-Tom and the others get to Polastrindu after a close encounter where they were nearly eaten. Appears in Books One, Two, and Four. Roseroar the Tiger Roseroar is a massive humanoid white Siberian Tiger who is very skilled at fighting with swords as well as her own claws. She seems to speak with a pronounced Southern drawl. There was a suggestion of a possible romance between her and Jon-Tom in the series but it was never explored. Appears in Book Three. Caz the Rabbit Caz is a savvy and gentlemanly gambler, somewhat more experienced in cheating in cards than in dice. Extremely polite, even to the point of apologizing to enemies during a fight, Caz is as adept at manipulating words as cards, and often serves as the group's diplomat during his appearances in Books One and Two. Pog the Bat Pog is Clothahump's first famulus. He has no respect for Clothahump's powers and often directs derisory remarks at him. He indentured himself into service with Clothahump as he wished to attract the attentions of a female peregrine falcon and wanted to make himself more attractive. Clothahump has the means to transform him into a more pleasing form, but ultimately it is his friendship with Jon-Tom that sees his dreams realized... though not in a way anyone expected. Appears in Books One and Two. Sorbl Sorbl is an owl and Clothahump's second famulus. Unfortunately, he is extremely unreliable due to his alcoholism. First appears in Book Three, joining the main cast. The otter tribe A jolly adventure loving tribe of otters who help Jon-Tom and Mudge on their quest in book four. Colin Colin is a Koala in book five that the party rescued from cannibals. He is a fortune teller, predicting using runes, though sometimes his predictions may not be completely correct. He has an accent similar to John Wayne. Cautious Cautious is a raccoon from book six, who comes from a Cajun-style tribe of animals. A tragic incident in the past caused him to lose all emotions making him extremely stoic, though he has a few rare non-stoic moments. Folly A young girl the heroes rescue from pirates in book three she sees Jon-Tom as her knight in shining armour despite she is much too young, which Jon-Tom uncomfortably tells her but that that doesn't deter her. Dormas A no nonsense hinny who is hired as a guide to the northlands in book five. She writes romance novels in her spare time. Drom A gay unicorn in book three. Teyva a winged horse in book six whom due to a traumatic almost fatal childhood accident is afraid of flying. Gragelouth a sloth merchant from book seven, who aspires to find treasure inspiring Jon- Tom's son and Mudge's kids to tag along. Snaugenhutt A rhino mercenary from book seven who is useless when drunk, but an unstoppable force when sober. Viz Snaugenhutt's tickbird.

It is the capital of the Vega Alta comarca, an old form of provincial subdivision). Its current population consisted of 34,889 inhabitants in the year 2018. The Segura River passes by the town. Its economy is based on agriculture, mainly in the cultivation of peaches and olives, but industry is also important, since 4,000 people work in that sector. The public sector, transports and tourism are also very important in the local economy. Main sights Populated since the Paleolithic Age, the area of Cieza is home to archaeological excavations in Almadenes, La Serreta, and Barranco de los Grajos. There are also Iberian remains (found at Bolvax), as well as Roman, Visigothic, and Arabic deposits. The Arabs, who inhabited the area from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, and who knew the area as Medina Siyâsa, left behind a mountain fortress. At the dig site of Medina Siyâsa, many decorative architectural elements have been found, such as engraved arches and porticos, and polychromed ceramics, glass, metals, etc. All these discoveries are kept in the museum of Siyâsa. The Ermita (\\"hermitage\\") de la Virgen del Buen Suceso is located in the area known as Collado de la Atalaya. The Plaza de España is located in the heart of the city. The modern market was built in 1929 by Julio Carrilero. El Paseo (\\"The Walkway\\") contains pictorial work in glazed tile by José Lucas, who dedicated the different tiles to several men of letters.

The building was constructed in the Neoclassical Italianate style between 1869 and 1871. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is also Nevada Historical Marker number 25. Construction Abraham Curry, the founder of Carson City, reserved an area equivalent to four city blocks (10 acres or 4.04 ha) at the center of the town for the future state capitol. When the Capitol building was constructed, it was naturally located on \\"the plaza\\", which had, some ten or eleven years earlier, been designated for it, and given for that purpose. Mark Twain wrote in his book Roughing It that the capitol site was in 1861 \\"a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a liberty pole in it, and very useful as a place for public auctions, horse trades, mass meetings, and likewise for teamsters to camp in.\\" The \\"act to provide for the erection of a State Capitol\\" was passed by the Nevada Legislature and signed into law by Governor Henry G. Blasdel during 1869. The Board of Capitol Commissioners received bids of $84,000 to $160,000 for construction and they chose the lowest bid, submitted by Peter Cavanaugh and Son of Carson City. The 1869 act authorized $100,000 for construction, with money to come from a special tax levy, plus the proceeds from the sale of some public land. To reduce costs, the building sandstone was obtained free of charge from the Nevada State Prison quarry, just outside Carson City. In spite of this, the construction costs increased to some $170,000, exceeding even the high bid. The cornerstone was laid on June 9, 1870. A brass box that served as a time capsule was deposited in the stone. The cornerstone was a solid block of sandstone, laid on top of blocks which contained the capsule. The capsule was inspected and returned to the cornerstone location (the northeast corner of the original building) during reconstruction in the 1979–81 period. The fourth session of the state legislature met in the still-incomplete building at the beginning of 1871. Construction was completed by May 1, 1871. Several of the architect's original drawings are preserved in the state archives. Architecture Nevada State Capitol in 1875 Octagonal annex The original building was cruciform, with a central rectangle wide by deep (23 x 25.8 m). It had two wings, each wide by deep (10.6 x 15.8 m). The windows' glass panes are made of 26-ounce (737 g) French crystal, as are those above the doors. Floors and wainscotting are of Alaskan marble, shipped to San Francisco in 20-ton (18,144 kg) blocks and there cut and polished for installation. The first floor contained a major office at each corner connected by central halls, while the wings of the second floor were filled by the two legislative chambers—the Assembly and the Senate. The octagonal dome topped with a cupola admitted light to the second story. During 1906, an octagonal Annex was added to the rear (east) of the capitol to house the State Library. By the early 20th century, the legislature had outgrown the capitol, and prominent Nevada architect Frederic DeLongchamps was contracted to design northern and southern legislative wing-annexes, completed in time for the 1915 session. These compatible wings used stone from the same quarry as the original portion of the capitol, and provided more office space and expanded legislative chambers. Usage For more than 50 years, all three parts of the state government were housed in the Capitol. The Supreme Court met here until 1937, when it relocated into an adjacent building, and the Nevada Legislature met here until 1971, when it relocated to its new Legislative Building just south of the Capitol. Every Nevada governor except the first has had his office in the capitol. Nowadays, the Capitol continues to serve the Governor, and contains historical exhibits on the second floor.

It was designed by Joseph Paxton and opened on 5 April 1847. It is generally acknowledged as the first publicly funded civic park in the world. The park was designated a conservation area in 1977 and declared a Grade I listed landscape by English Heritage in 1995. The park influenced the design of Central Park in New York and Sefton Park in Liverpool. The park contains many listed buildings. The Grand Entrance was designed by Lewis Hornblower and is at the northeast corner; it consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in Ionic style. The Swiss Bridge, a pedestrian span of stringer construction, is unique as being the only covered bridge of traditional wooden construction in the United Kingdom. There is also a Pavilion called the Roman Boathouse standing by the lake in the park, the upper storey of which was originally intended to be a bandstand. There are many historic listed lodges of various designs within the grounds of the park. The park has a modern visitor centre, café, children's play area, woodland walks and various sporting facilities and clubs. History Roman Pavilion and Boathouse The Swiss Bridge over the lake. In 1841 an Improvement Commission within Birkenhead's local government proposed the idea of a municipal park. A Private Act of Parliament allowed it to use public money to buy of marshy grazing land on the western edge of Birkenhead. Plots of land on the edge of the proposed park were then sold off in order to finance its construction. The park plan was designed by Joseph Paxton and the building was supervised by Edward Kemp because both had previously worked on redesigning the gardens at Chatsworth House. Entrances, gateways, lodges, and other structures were designed for the park by Lewis Hornblower and John Robertson. Meanwhile, high-class residential accommodation was being built both around the park and in other areas, such as Clifton Park, the layout and buildings designed by Walter Scott and Charles Reed. Although some large houses and private villas were initially built by local merchants and wealthier business people, the Long Depression in the latter 19th century meant many plots remained undeveloped well into early 20th century. The park took five years to build and was officially opened on 5 April 1847 by Lord Morpeth, an estimated 10,000 people attended on that day. The park had an informal style rather than a structured neatly arranged urban garden. Several miles of drainage pipes were laid to remove the water from the marshy land. During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth were moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. It also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between Claughton and Woodside. Paxton planted trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park. Buildings included the Swiss Bridge, Boathouse, Norman Lodges, Gothic Lodge, Castellated Lodge and Italian Lodge. The Grand Entrance, which is one of several into the park, was built to look like a classical triumphal arch. Eisteddfod stone within the Park. During the First World War, part of the park was used as a training ground by the 3rd Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment. Recruits stayed at the Birkenhead Barracks on Grange Road West. Conscientious objectors were sent to the 3rd Cheshires because the battalion had a tough reputation. The family of a local trade unionist and \\"conchie\\", George Beardsworth, watched as he was repeatedly beaten and thrown over an obstacle course in the park. Although his treatment at Birkenhead led to questions in Parliament and a court case against the officers and men involved, no one was ever censured or prosecuted. In 1917 the National Eisteddfod of Wales (\\"The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair\\"), which was attended by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, was held within the park. The park had already paid host to the event in 1878 and 1879. During the Second World War the area was damaged by bombs and a Spitfire made a crash landing in the park. The park was designated a conservation area in 1977 and declared a Grade I listed landscape by English Heritage in 1995. The park became run down and neglected towards the end of the part of the 20th century. Beginning in the late 2000s, it has undergone major restoration work. A purpose-built visitors centre has been installed and work done to restore its original buildings and bridges as well as tidy up the lakes and parklands, and unblock the drainage system. The park underwent a five-year £11.5 million renovation completed in 2007, funded jointly by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Wirral Waterfront SRB, Wirral Council, and the European Union via the Objective One programme. All of the paths have been improved, trees and shrubs have been planted, the lakes have been emptied, cleaned and reshaped and most of the original features have been restored to their former Victorian glory. Influence on other parks Map of Birkenhead Park Birkenhead park was the first park to be established at public expense in the United Kingdom. Prior to Birkenhead all parks had been created by private individuals or private organisations and access was held privately, although it could be given to the public. Birkenhead park was influential on the design of public parks both in the UK and internationally and it is considered a landmark in the history of public parks. In 1850, American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted arrived by ship in Liverpool. During his stay in Northwest England, he paid a visit to Birkenhead Park along with several other public gardens. He noted Birkenhead was \\"a model town\\" which was built \\"all in accordance with the advanced science, taste, and enterprising spirit that are supposed to distinguish the nineteenth century\\". In 1858, he and Calvert Vaux won the competition to design a new park, Central Park, for the rapidly growing city of New York. Olmsted, who was influenced by the park, was greatly impressed by Paxton's designs. In his book Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England, he wrote about its social value as an aesthetic form: > five minutes of admiration, and a few more spent studying the manner in > which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was > ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be thought of > as comparable with this People’s Garden. Olmsted also commented on the \\"perfection\\" of the park's gardening: > I cannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as had > evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding > paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface, where on all > sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers, with more than > natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest turf, and all kept > with consummate neatness. Birkenhead Park was used as a template for the creation of Sefton Park, which opened in Liverpool in 1872. Points of interest The gabled cricket pavilion Jackson Memorial drinking fountain The Grand Entrance is at the northeast entrance to Birkenhead Park. It consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in Ionic style. The entrance was designed by Lewis Hornblower, with amendments by Joseph Paxton, the designer of the park. The park, and its entrance, were opened in 1847. The Grand Entrance is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The Swiss Bridge, a pedestrian span of stringer construction built in 1847, is unique as being the only covered bridge of traditional wooden construction (similar to North American and European covered bridges) in the United Kingdom. It was modelled after similar wooden bridges in Switzerland. The Roman Boathouse stands by the lake in the park, the upper storey was originally intended to be a bandstand. It is built in stone and consists of a square pavilion with a segmental arch to the boathouse, above which is an arcaded and pilastered storey and a pantile roof. The Cricket Pavilion was built in 1849, designed by Lewis Hornblower, in brick with a Welsh slate roof and has a single storey. In front of it is a timber verandah carried on cast iron Corinthian columns. This has three gables, with a clock in the apex of the central gable, and the date 1846, the date of the founding of the club. It is one of the earliest surviving cricket pavilions in the country. The Jackson Memorial Drinking Fountain near the main entrance to Birkenhead Park is in the form of an obelisk that was made in 1860. It is in polished granite, and stands on a pedimented plinth surrounded by steps. It is dedicated to John Somerville Jackson who was instrumental in the creation of the park.

In 2009, there were 877 pupils, of whom 271 were in the sixth form. Although royally chartered by Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, there had already been a school in Horncastle for 250 years. The original charter document, with its royal seal, remains in the custody of the school's governors. The school's catchment area includes Horncastle and the surrounding area: Wragby, Bardney and Woodhall Spa to the west, the Lincolnshire Wolds to the north and east, and Coningsby. History =Foundation= A school is known to have existed in Horncastle in 1327, but records of the present school effectively begin when Queen Elizabeth I granted the charter to establish a grammar school in Horncastle, on the petition of Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. The school received its seal on 25 June 1571 and the charter document remains in the possession of the present school governors. The original school was built on a site adjoining the River Bain, close to St Mary's Parish Church. It was demolished and rebuilt after the Civil War on the same site, remaining there until the first decade of the 20th century. The first building on the present site was established in 1908, and now serves as the dining hall. The summer of 2008 was the school's 100th year on the present site and was duly marked by several centenary celebrations. =Coeducation and expansion= For much of its existence, Queen Elizabeth's was a boys-only day and boarding school. Girls were first admitted around the time the school moved to its present site. The school continued to expand, with further buildings added as enrolment increased. Queen Elizabeth's was an independent school until the Education Act of 1944 came into effect, after which the school voluntarily transferred control and finance responsibility to the local authority. =Change of status= In the autumn of 1991, the parents voted overwhelmingly for the school to become a self-governing grant maintained school. When grant maintained status was abolished by the new Labour government under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, schools were offered a choice of returning to local authority control or opting for foundation status. Foundation status offered an environment within the education authority but with autonomous school governors controlling admissions criteria and standards for the school, directly hiring and employing the school's staff and holding ownership of the school's estate. This was the route the school selected and Queen Elizabeth's gained a degree of independence from the local authority. In 2003, Queen Elizabeth's gained joint specialist status for science and mathematics in partnership with Banovallum School, Horncastle's secondary modern school. A second specialism for modern languages was added in 2008. The school converted to academy status in September 2012, and became independent of local authority control. School estate The school consists of the main school building and several outer buildings. The main building contains 30 classrooms, 4 information technology (IT) rooms, school offices, a main hall, a sports centre, a sixth-form block and a library. There are several outer buildings, including the science, English and music blocks. The music block contains two music classrooms along with practice rooms, a large drama studio and lighting balcony, two art classrooms and a gallery. The new English block contains four classrooms and an office. Admissions The school is made up of three parts: *Lower School (Years 7, 8 and 9) *Middle School (Years 10 and 11 – GCSE Years) *Upper School (the Sixth Form – A Level Years) Entry at age eleven is determined by the school's own selection procedures. Normally, the school commences four forms of pupils annually, representing the top 25% of the catchment area ability range. Continuation to the school's Sixth Form is open to all pupils for whom the school can provide a suitable course of study. The school uniform is mandatory for all pupils. For years 7 to 11, this consists of a maroon blazer and a maroon-blue-and-white tie. In the sixth form, until the start of the 19/20 academic year, boys wore a black blazer and black-and- gold tie, while girls wore a navy blazer with a navy-and-silver tie. Since the start of the 19/20 academic year, boys and girls in the sixth form wear a black blazer with a red-and-silver tie. =Catchment= The school's catchment area includes Horncastle and the surrounding area: Wragby, Bardney and Woodhall Spa to the west, the Lincolnshire Wolds to the north and east, and Coningsby. =Transport arrangements= A fleet of contract and services buses, organised by the education authority, provides transport for pupils in the school's catchment area, who live more than from the school. The school is also served by a privately organised service for out-of-catchment area pupils from the Sibsey and Stickney areas to the north of Boston, as well as Lincoln and its surrounding area. Academics A November 2011 Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education) inspection described the school as \\"outstanding\\", consistently placing above national averages in GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) examinations.

Controversy In 2014, the school experienced a sex scandal when it was discovered that, whilst on a school trip, two pupils under the age of consent had sexual intercourse. The event occurred when girls allegedly sneaked into the \\"boys only\\" dormitory, unbeknownst to staff as they were sleeping. The decision by the school was to suspend the staff involved with the trip, however the suspensions have since been revoked. The pupils who committed the act were also suspended. Parents of the pupils who attended the trip received letters from the school. The school was met with dismay from the parents with one explaining \\"I am worried about letting my children go on trips and I know some other parents feel the same.\\" A pupil also added \\"It's no big secret. It [sex] has gone on on other trips.\\" The school's chair of governors stated that the welfare of pupils is a priority and that school trips are assessed for risks, and that the matter had been dealt with in an \\"appropriate and proportional way\\".

It borders Lawrence Park (to the southeast) which was ranked Canada's wealthiest neighbourhood in 2011. The City of Toronto's neighbourhood definitions places most of Bedford Park, including Bedford Park Avenue in the Lawrence Park North Planning Neighbourood and the remaining western and northern portions of Bedford Park within a larger neighbourhood, called Bedford Park-Nortown. The border of this larger area extend to Bathurst Street on the west, Highway 401 to the north, Hillhurst Boulevard (just north of Eglinton Avenue) to the south, and zigzags from northeast to southwest along Yonge Street and Avenue Road. There are three census tracts created by Statistics Canada in Bedford Park: 0141.01, 0141.02, 0142.00. History The area began as a hamlet that was a popular stopover for farmers making their way to market in the city. The neighbourhood was likely named after the Bedford Park Hotel, which opened in 1873 at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and Fairlawn Avenue, just north of Lawrence Avenue. The corner now houses Sebastien patisserie. streetcar rails on Lawrence Avenue and Yonge Street, c. 1922. Streetcars service began in Bedford Park in 1890. In 1890 Bedford Park was amalgamated with the hamlets of Davisville and Eglinton to the south, and incorporated as the Town of North Toronto. In the same year, the Metropolitan Street Railway of Toronto began service to the area, encouraging residential development. Bedford Park is bisected by Yonge Street, lying north of Lawrence Avenue and east of Avenue Road. The northern boundary is Brooke Avenue on the West side of Yonge, and Snowdon Avenue to the east of Yonge. The eastern boundary is Ronan Avenue. There is also a school north east of Yonge and Lawrence called Bedford Park Public School. The original homes in the area were constructed between 1890 and 1940. Bedford Park was conceived as a middle class housing development on the northern boundary of the city, with mid-sized detached and semi-detached homes. The relocation of the Rosedale Golf Club in 1909 to the section of the Don Valley northeast of Bedford Park brought about development of the (more moneyed) bordering neighbourhoods of Lawrence Park and Teddington Park. This has skyrocketed the property values of Bedford Park homes. Bedford Park's quiet streets, mature trees, good schools and parks, and proximity to Highway 401 and Lawrence subway station attract young professionals and their families to the neighbourhood. Many of the original homes still stand, with a number having undergone extensive renovations. A portion of the original homes in the neighbourhood have been torn down and replaced with larger, more modern homes. Demographics View of a residential street in Bedford Park. More than half of Bedford Park residents stated they were a third-generation Canadian or higher in the Canada 2011 Census. In 2011, there were 4599 people living in Bedford Park, 2260 male and 2375 female. 53% were third or higher generation Canadian, meaning the resident and both parents were born in Canada. 26.2% were second generation and 20.7% were first generation (immigrants). In 2006, there were 4360 residents, 2105 male and 2220 female. 50% were third or higher generation. 28.8% were second generation and 21.2% were first generation. The city is Census Tract 0141.02.

He joined the Spanish navy in 1866, and developed the first electric-powered submarine which was launched in 1888, but it was not accepted by political authorities,but it was accepted by the naval. He then left the navy to develop other inventions commercially. Early life IJune 1, 1851, where his father, a seaman in the Spanish navy, was based. In 1859 his father was relocated to the military base of San Fernando (Cádiz Province). At 14 he decided to join his brother Alejandro in the naval academy Colegio Naval Militar de San Carlos. This was a financial sacrifice for the family and he studied hard to get the best marks. At 16, after only two years, he joined the Spanish navy as a guardiamarina de 2ª (midshipman). He also studied geography, physics and astronomy. Peral took part in combat in the Third Carlist War in Spain, and in Cuba. He was awarded a wide range of medals for his service. In 1876, in Cádiz, Peral married María del Carmen Cencio, daughter of an army doctor. They had nine children but four of them died young. In 1881, Peral was serving as a second lieutenant and member of a hydrographical team in the Philippines. While there, during a visit to the barber's he received a small cut in his temple, which caused lasting illness and later became the site of a brain tumor. Development of the submarine The Peral Submarine Because of his ill-health Peral could not travel any more, so he was given a post in Cádiz, teaching in the new naval school Escuela de Ampliación de Estudios de la Armada. There he found time to pursue his idea of a battery-powered submarine with a system to discharge torpedoes while under water. His main problems were his need for finance to develop and test his inventions, lack of official support, and especially his arrogance when dealing with superiors with less vision. Peral's design for a submarine was first conceived on 20 September 1884, when he wrote a paper which would become his Proyecto de Torpedero Submarino (\\"Project for a submarine torpedoboat\\").Ayala Carcedo, Francisco Javier and Aláez Zazuerca, José Antonio (2001). Historia de la tecnología en España. V. 2. Valatenea, p. 492. After performing several studies and experiments, and having gained support from his superiors and fellow officers, Peral presented his idea to the Spanish navy staff. In September 1885, he wrote a letter to the Spanish naval minister, vice-admiral Pezuela y Lobo. Pezuela y Lobo called Peral to Madrid to have a personal interview with him. After the interview Pezuela y Lobo agreed to finance Peral's preliminary studies in Cádiz with an initial budget of 5,000 pesetas before launching a program to build a full-scale submarine boat. The Peral submarine was the first practical submarine ever made. It was launched on September 8, 1888, and subsequently in a test with naval authorities it successfully made a simulated attack on a cruiser at night without being noticed and returned to port without any damage. The submarine was coastal, however, because it lacked a double-hull and Diesel engine (petrol engines were not reliable at the time). Its performance was hardly equaled ten years later in other submarines. But a second project was rejected by naval authorities. Peral was losing control over his project and getting frustrated. He destroyed the inside of the submarine plus the plans to avoid foreign spies copying it.Almodóvar, pp. 132-134 Retirement and death Reception to Isaac Peral in Madrid, summer of 1890, by Narciso Méndez Bringa. Isaac Peral, frustrated with the group of senior naval engineers that were supposed to supervise his project, retired from active naval duty in November 1891. He established his family in Madrid, founding an electric company and still inventing and patenting other inventions, such as an electric machine gun or the blueprints of the first electric power plants of Spain. He still was hoping that his submarine design would be adopted by the government at any moment. After an operation in Berlin to cure the brain tumor he had been suffering from for some years, Peral contracted meningitis. He died from it in Berlin in May 1895. Initially buried in Madrid, in 1911 his body was relocated to Cartagena, where there is now a museum devoted to his persona and inventions. Subsequent developments in submarine design In 1895 John Philip Holland marked a major step forward in submarine development, designing for the first time a mixed internal combustion/electric propulsion system that would overcome the limited range of batteries. The first submarine to go on active duty in the Spanish Navy was built 22 years later based on the Holland class submarine and was named after Peral. His own experimental submarine was written off by the navy in 1913, but was salvaged in 1929 and sent to Cartagena, home port of the navy's submarine flotilla. It was kept in the local Arsenal, until it was handed over to the city, displayed from 1965 in different places of the harbour, and ultimately (2012) shown in the nearby Naval Museum of Cartagena. Submarines with Peral's name in the Spanish Navy Peral's submarine torpedo boat is also known as the Peral Submarine, but never bore this name in service.

She is, but not directly, an aspect of the male Urthona, one of the Four Zoas. She is in fact the Emanation of Los, also male. There is a complex verbal nexus attached. The Zoa Tharmas has emanation Enion, and Eni-tharm(as)-on is one derivation of her name. That should perhaps be read in the inverse direction though, as a construction of the Tharmas/Enion pair's names. Within Blake's myth, she represents female domination and sexual restraints that limit the artistic imagination. She, with Los, gives birth to various children, including Orc. Background It is possible that the character Enitharmon was based on Blake's wife, Catherine Blake. In a letter from Blake to his friend Thomas Butts, Jr. on 22 November 1802, he claimed that his place at Surrey had \\"Enitharmon's bower\\". S. Foster Damon explained the name Enitharmon as a derivation or an elision of (z)enit(h)-harmon(y). This is to be read in the light of the mirrored name Los (Sol = Sun in Latin). He also suggested that the Greek anarithmon or \\"numberless\\" as another possible starting point for the name. Urthona is \\"earth-owner\\". Enitharmon is not therefore a simplistic Earth Goddess, but is also not disconnected from that role. Her name can also be broken down to form the names of her two material parents, Enion and Tharmas.Damon 1988 p. 124 Character Enitharmon represents spiritual beauty and poetic inspiration. She is symbolised by the moon and she is characterised by Pity. With Los, she is connected to the North in that they were from Urthona, who dominates there. As poetic instinct, Enitharmon is represented as being born of the sexual problems that happen during puberty. She rules as the Queen of Heaven in Blake's works.Frye p. 127 In Enitharmon's connection to Urthona, who is represented by the loins, she is a goddess that represents what cannot be found within nature. In a natural cycle within Blake's myth, there is a repeating image of an Old Woman, who is represented by Rahab, Enitharmon, or Vala based on which part of the cycles are being discussed.Bloom 1993 pp. 32, 60 Enitharmon represents what Los is trying to create, and he cannot have Enitharmon until he is able to complete his duty. In her connection to space, she represents the psychological aspects of unbound space upon the mind.Frye 1990 p. 261 Unlike the other Emanations, she is not a shade of a divine form, but serves as a material wife of Los as well as his Emanation. Blake's early myth describes how she was born after Los gave a material form to Urizen, and she was born as the first female. In his later myth, the sight of Enitharmon's birth caused Urthona to fall and be born from Enion. In that version, both Los and Enitharmon spring from Enion. After her birth, Enitharmon declares that women will rule the world, with Man being given Love and Women being given Pride. This would create within men a fear of female dominance that would in turn bring them under control of the females. In her sexual system, there are four parts: Manathu-Varcyon (desire), Antamon (sperm), Theotormon (frustration), and finally Sotha (war). These are represented by sexual desire being contained to Ethinthus (body), which leads to Leutha (guilt), followed by Oothoon (frustration) and ends with Thiralatha (erotic dreams). In the last stage, war is the ultimate result of sexual repression. This war is connected to general war and to energy as a whole. Sex is supposed to lead to imagination and love. Love is supposed to leave one to a higher state, and the perversion of sexuality, in Blake's view, leads to destruction.Frye 1990 pp. 262–263 The Female Will is born from an object of affection refusing to give up its independence, and the concept represents what prohibits an individual from being able to have true vision.Frye 1990 p. 263 Under Eitharmon's rule, representing the rule of the Female Will, leads to Los and Enitharmon entering into a constant state of strife with each other. However, the conflict also leads to Los pursuing her and the two procreating. Urizen is able to take advantage of the struggling between the two by tempting them with the ability to judge Luvah and Vala. This causes both of them to lose the last bit of their innocence. Their union was thereafter filled with both envy and jealousy. Their union also causes Enion to lament over the fallen state that began from this.Bloom 1993 pp. 78, 84 She is married to Los, and through their marriage Orc, the representation of revolution, is born. This symbolises the relationship between art and revolution. Los, however, grows jealous of Orc and chains him to a mountain. Enitharmon tries to intervene but Los is unable to release Orc. Following Orc, Enitharmon gives birth to many children. Of these, Satan, John Milton, and Mary are described as her children.Damon 1988 pp. 124–125 Appearances Enitharmon appears in Europe a Prophecy, which compares her rule in regards to the fall of Christian culture. Through her, oracles and the Olympian gods are brought back.Frye 1990 p. 262 The bulk of the work is devoted to Enitharmon's domination of the material world and puts forth various sexual rules through religion. Blake describes how these rules are errors found in orthodox Christianity. The Book of Urizen describes how Los's pity, Enitharmon, separated from him and became the first female after Los created a form for Urizen. In Vala, or The Four Zoas, she is similar to eve and she is the tempter of Los/Adam. The work also describes the connection of poetic instinct and sexuality, along with pointing out how she and her daughters are able to create various things, such as a body for various Spectres to be created. Milton a Poem describes how Enitharmon gave birth to many children, which included Milton himself. In the work, she is described as being connected to Space while Los is connected to Time. In Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion, she is connected to poetry, and she realizes that she must eventually vanish in the end. Enitharmon is described as having a Looking Glass, which reflects the Eternal world in the Material world. This image appears in the 99th illustration of Blake's to the works of Dante. The design shows the Queen of Heaven, who represents feminine rule and the glass is of materialism.Damon 1988 pp. 124–125, 246 She also appears as an illustration in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.['The Marriage of Heaven and Hell', with an introduction and commentary by Sir Geoffrey Keynes, Oxford University Press 1975 Link text], additional text.

History The film originates from a genre called internet fiction (인터넷 소설) (movies such as My Sassy Girl (엽기적인그녀), Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do (도레미파솔라시도), A Millionaire's First Love (백만장자의 첫사랑), Romance of Their Own (늑대의 유혹), and He Was Cool (그놈은 멋있었다) were also derived from internet fiction. This popular internet fiction was later released in the form of a four-part book series that was later turned into a movie. Although there are many scenes that were taken out and also added in place, it was a big hit around that time to create movies that derived from internet fiction stories and writers.cine21.com The original Korean title can be literally translated as My Love, the Asshole, or, more roughly, as My Love, the No-manners. Plot After being dumped by her boyfriend just before their 100-day anniversary, Ha-Yeong (Ha Ji-won) meets a college guy named Hyung-Jun (Kim Jaewon) when she kicks a can that accidentally hits him in the face and causes him to scratch his Lexus. He demands she pay him $3000 on the spot. She escapes from him, accidentally leaving her wallet behind. Hyung-Jun stalks her, demanding money to pay for his car. Since she is a poor high school student Hyung-Jun writes up an \\"Enslavement Agreement\\" for Ha-Yeong in order to pay for the damage to his car. Ha-Yeong is thrown into a nightmarish slave life for 100 days, running his errands, i.e.: cleaning his house, carrying his shopping, and cleaning his car. By accident she finds out that the damage to Hyung-Jun's car costs only $10. She then takes her revenge by damaging his car and his reputation. But Hyung-Jun takes revenge by becoming her new tutor. This brings them close to each other and they realize they love one another. Hyung-Jun frees Ha-Yeong from \\"slavery\\" as the 100 days are over and later even kisses her standing in-front of her house's main gate. Ha-Yeong's mother sees this and threatens Hyung-Jun to stay away from her daughter's life, then brings a new tutor to teach Ha-Yeong. Ha-Yeong tells Hyung-Jun that she wants to marry him but he says that he only toyed with her. Hyung-Jun leaves his apartment which makes Ha-Yeong more vulnerable. She studies hard so she can get into Hyung-Jun's college. After the exams, when she finds out she was not selected to enter the same college as Hyung-Jun, her tutor takes her to a place where she finds Hyung-Jun telling her that she was selected into his college but he wanted to give her a surprise. After a long time we see Ha- Yeong driving while talking to Hyung-Jun about all the chores that he did not do. A high school kid is shown who kicks a can that accidentally hits her in the face and causes her to scratch her Lexus. She tells him that there is only one way to get out of paying for damages, hinting at working for them and do the chores she was just talking to Hyung-Jun about. Cast * Kim Jaewon ...

The pre-1973 spelling was Kakortok. The pronunciation of both sounds like . formerly Julianehåb,The pre-1948 spelling was Julianehaab. is a town in the Kujalleq municipality in southern Greenland, located near Cape Thorvaldsen. With a population of 3,050 in 2020, it is the most populous town in southern Greenland and the fifth- largest town on the island.  History  The area around Qaqortoq has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Beginning with the Saqqaq culture roughly 4,300 years ago, the area has had a continuous human presence. = Saqqaq culture = The earliest signs of population presence are from roughly 4,300 years ago. While Saqqaq-era sites are generally the most numerous of all the prehistoric sites in Greenland, around Qaqortoq the Saqqaq presence is less prominent, with only sporadic sites and items such as chipped stone drills and carving knives. = Dorset culture = The Dorset people arrived in the Qaqortoq area around 2,800 years ago. Several rectangular peat dwelling structures, characteristic of the early Dorset culture, can be found around the wider Qaqortoq area. = Norse culture = Written records of South Greenland history begin with the arrival of the Norse in the late 10th century. The ruins of Hvalsey the most prominent Norse ruins in Greenland are located northeast of Qaqortoq. General or even limited trade between the Norse and the Thule people was scarce. Except a few novel and exotic items found at Thule sites in the area, evidence suggests cultural exchange was initially sporadic. Later, the south Greenland Norse adopted trade with the southern Inuit and were for a time the major supplier of ivory to northern Europe. The Norse era lasted for almost five hundred years, ending in the mid-15th century. The last written record of the Norse presence is of a wedding in the Hvalseyjarfjord church in 1408. = Thule people = The Thule culture Inuit arrived in southern Greenland and the Qaqortoq area around the 12th century and were contemporaneous with the Norse. However, there exists little evidence of early contact. The Thule culture was characterized by a subsistence existence and there are few, if any, dwellings of considerable structure to be found from the era. Items, however, are relatively numerous. = Colonial era until present = Qaqortoq (Julianehaab) in 1860. The present-day town was founded in 1775 by the Dano-Norwegian trader Anders Olsen, on behalf of the General Trading Company.Marquardt, Ole. \\"Change and Continuity in Denmark's Greenland Policy\\" in The Oldenburg Monarchy: An Underestimated Empire?. Verlag Ludwig (Kiel), 2006. The town was christened Julianehaab after the Danish queen Juliane Marie, although it sometimes mistakenly appears as \\"Julianshaab\\".Colton, G.W. \\"Northern America. British, Russian & Danish Possessions In North America.\\" J.H. Colton & Co. (New York), 1855. The name was also sometimes anglicized as Juliana's Hope.Lieber, Francis & al. Encyclopædia Americana: A Popular Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature, History, Politics and Biography. \\"Greenland\\". B.B. Mussey & Co., 1854. The town became a major center for the saddle-back seal trade and today remains the home of the Great Greenland sealskin tannery. Until December 31, 2008, the town was the administrative center of Qaqortoq municipality. On January 1, 2009, Qaqortoq became the biggest town and the administrative center of Kujalleq municipality, when the municipalities of Qaqortoq, Narsaq, and Nanortalik ceased to exist as administrative entities.  Landmarks  = Historical buildings = The building that now houses the Qaqortoq museum was originally the town's blacksmith's shop. The house was built in yellow stone and dates back to 1804. The oldest standing building at the historical colonial harbor and thus of all of Qaqortoq is a black-tarred log building from 1797. The building was designed by royal Danish architect Kirkerup, pre- assembled in Denmark, shipped in pieces to Qaqortoq, and then reassembled. = Stone & Man = From 1993 to 1994 Qaqortoq artist Aka Høegh and other 18 Nordic artists presided over the Stone & Man project, designed to transform the town into an open air art gallery. Eighteen artists from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Greenland carved 24 sculptures into the rock faces and boulders in the town. Today there are over 40 sculptures in the town, all part of the Stone & Man exhibit. = The fountain = The town is home to the oldest fountain in Greenland, Mindebrønden, finished in 1932. It was the only fountain in the country prior to another in Sisimiut. A tourist attraction, the fountain depicts whales spouting water out of their blowholes.  Transport  = Air = Qaqortoq heliport in 2008 Qaqortoq Heliport operates year-round, linking Qaqortoq with Narsarsuaq Airport and, indirectly, with the rest of Greenland and Europe. Feasibility assessments were underway regarding building a landing strip for fixed-wing aircraft. The issue was previously debated in 2007, when the Democrats opposed a Siumut landing strip proposal, citing ecological and environmental concerns. In contrast to the previous debates, presently the Democrats are lobbying for a runway, making passenger flights to continental Europe possible. A shorter, runway, supported by Siumut and Air Greenland, would enable flights to Iceland and eastern Canada. The cost of moving the airport from Narsarsuaq as a 1799-meter runway is estimated at DKK900 million (€120.7m), while a 1199-meter runway is estimated at DKK370 million (€50m). Presently Narsarsuaq airport is a community of 140 people, depending solely on the airport, but the Kujalleq Municipality supports the plans for moving the airport to the centre of South Greenland, thereby creating economic growth in the region.http://sermitsiaq.ag/11-siger-ja- lufthavn-qaqortoq Five locations for a possible airport was assessed. Four of these - at Prinsessen, Nunarsuatsiaap Kujalequtaa, Munkebugten, and halfway towards Narsaq - are for a domestic runway. Only one location, northwest of the town between Nuupiluk and Matup Tunua, would be suitable for a runway up to , in order to accommodate intercontinental flights. It was in 2011 expected that a new airport would be built before 2020, probably with a 1,499-meter runway behind the mountain of Saqqaarsik, being able to serve flights from Iceland and other parts of Greenland, thereby moving the air transport centre of South Greenland from Narsarsuaq to the centre of the region. The final political decision on the matter was then pending, but a final decision on the matter was expected within 2015–16. Further a road was (spring 2015) being constructed to the expected airport site behind Saqqaarsik Mountain. The decided site is at , 5 km north of town, having a decided runway of 1500 meters.Qaqortoq The access road was completed in 2016. = Land = Qaqortoq in summer As is true of all populated places in Greenland, Qaqortoq is not connected to any other place via roads. Fairly well trodden hiking trails lead north and west from the town, but for any motorized transportation all terrain vehicles are needed. During winter, snowmobiles become the transport of choice. = Sea = Qaqortoq is a port of call for the Arctic Umiaq ferry. The port authority for Qaqortoq is Royal Arctic Line, located in Nuuk. With a channel depth of , the port can accommodate vessels up to in length. The port offers pilotage upon request, but no tug boat services.  Economy and infrastructure  Autumn in Qaqortoq Qaqortoq is a seaport and trading station. Fish and shrimp processing, tanning, fur production, and ship maintenance and repair are important activities, but the economy is based primarily on educational and administrative services. The primary industries in the town are fishing, service, and administration. The native subsistence economy was long preserved by the former monopoly Royal Greenland Trading Department, which used the town as a source of saddle-back seal skins.Kane, Elisha Kent. Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition. 1856. The Great Greenland Furhouse is the only tannery in Greenland and the primary sealskin purchaser on the island; it remains one of the major employers in the town. Like the rest of Greenland, Qaqortoq is critically dependent upon investment from Denmark and relies heavily on Danish block funding. Of all exports produced in Qaqortoq, 70.1% are headed for the Danish market. = Employment = As with the rest of Greenland, unemployment in south Greenland - and thereby Qaqortoq - remains high. In 2010, the unemployment was at 10.4%, an increase of over 1.2% since 2009. For workers born outside Greenland unemployment was at 0.1% of the total eligible workforce during the same period. = Energy = All of Qaqortoq's electricity is supplied by the government-owned company Nukissiorfiit. Since 2007, Qaqortoq gets its electric power mainly from Qorlortorsuaq Dam by way of a 70 kV powerline. Previously the town's electricity was supplied by means of so-called \\"bunker fuel generators\\", three diesel ship engines converted to energy production. = Education = Qaqortoq is the main center for education in South Greenland and has a primary school, middle school, and high school, a folk high school which started as a workers' college (Sulisartut Højskoliat) in 1977, a school of commerce, and a basic vocational school. =Religion= Gertrud Rasch's Church Gertrud Rasch's Church Gertrud Rasch's Church (Danish: \\"Gertrud Rasks Kirke\\") is a white concrete Lutheran church. The church is named after Gertrud Rask, the wife of missionary Hans Egede. Due to the increasing population in Qaqortoq, the old church could no longer adequately serve the community, and a new church was commissioned by the Church of Denmark. Construction started in May 1972 and it was consecrated on July 8, 1973. It was designed by architect Ole Nielsen, and is made entirely of concrete. The church has a concrete altar. The motif of the altarpiece is based upon south Greenland flora. The church features a ten-stop Frobenius organ from 1973. = Healthcare = Qaqortoq is served by Napparsimavik Hospital, officially Napparsimavik Qaqortoq Sygehus. The hospital is also the main hospital in southern Greenland. With a staff of 59 people, presently the hospital has 18 beds. The three villages in Qaqortoq municipality - Eqalugaarsuit, Saarloq, and Qassimiut - also belong to the healthcare district of Napparsimavik Hospital. The villages are visited via sea and with a medical helicopter in case of emergencies. During the summer of 2010, the hospital used Greenland-grown vegetables exclusively. = Tourism = Qaqortoq in winter Tourism is a significant contributor to the economy of the town. The Qaqortoq Tourist Service - Greenland Sagalands - is the tourist office. Roughly two-thirds of all tourists (65.5%) are from Denmark. There are several facilities offering accommodations, including the Qaqortoq Hostel. The Qaqortoq Museum offers services in English, Danish, and Kalaallisut. The Great Greenland Furhouse is also a popular tourist attraction. Tourists are offered year-round activities such as kayaking, guided hiking, whale-watching, cross-country skiing, and boating. In recent years, Qaqortoq has experienced a decline in tourist revenue, with an average of 1,700 tourists annually staying in the town overnight, very much due to the lack of an airport close to the town. The Qaqortoq Stadium is the first artificial grass football stadium in Greenland. The Danish Crown Princely family visited the town as part of an official tour of Greenland in summer 2014.  Demographics  With 3,050 inhabitants as of 2020, Qaqortoq is the largest town in the Kujalleq municipality. The population is nearly unchanged from its 1995 levels. There exists no gender imbalance among native Greenlanders in Qaqortoq, the only gender inequity is among inhabitants born outside Greenland, with 3 out of 5 being male. As of 2011 10% of the town's inhabitants were born outside Greenland, a decline from 20% in 1991, but an increase from a 9% low in 2001.

The southern tip of Greenland does not experience permafrost. The cold waters of the Labrador Basin ensure that summer stays below the tree line in spite of it being below the 61st parallel. Winters are much milder than at much lower coastal parallels in continental North America due to the marine effect. Therefore, the seasonal variation in the climate is very small for a location so far north.

The population of the village at the 2011 United Kingdom Census was 2,494. Calow is in the North East Derbyshire local government district of Derbyshire and is located immediately adjacent to the larger market town of Chesterfield. The origins of the village date back to 1086, when it was known as Kalehal (the bare corner of land). In 1430 it was known as Calell, then Calo in 1561 before acquiring its present name. It is recorded that there was a manor house which ’belonged to the king’ around the same time that the Domesday Book was compiled. The manor was in the possession of the successive families of Breton, Loudham and Foljambe, which were notable families at the time. Coal and iron were worked in the village and for some time blast furnaces were in operation. Coal mined in Calow supplied furnaces in the nearby village of Duckmanton. Calow is now considered a suburb of Chesterfield, even though it is not in the town's borough. It is a popular place to live due to its convenient location. The Royal Hospital, built just outside the boundaries of Calow, was opened in 1986. Amenities in Calow include; shops, a post office, a small park, a chemist, a primary school and a community centre. Methodist minister the Rev'd Kathleen Richardson took as her title ’Baroness Richardson of Calow’, after the village, when she was created a life peer in 1998. Baroness Richardson was the subject of an edition BBC Radio 4 programme 'Lords A Living'. The programme, broadcast in January 2011, reflected on the Baroness returning to visit the village in which she spent her childhood.Announcement of her introduction at the House of Lords House of Lords minutes of proceedings, 12 October 1998 The village Scout Group was formed by the Reverend C.

Membership of SPCS rose to a peak of 25,000 in the 1970s. Since then, membership numbers have declined to the present steady level of about 400. The current president is John Mills, businessman and Elder of the Kapiti Christian Fellowship, and the executive director is David Lane. Lane is the most active figure in the society, researching current issues in New Zealand society with the information gathered being used for press releases and submissions.

O’Donnell, 2008- Activities Initially, the organisation campaigned against pornography in films, videos and magazines. However, Howley v Lawrence Publishing [1986] (Court of Appeal) initiated a string of anti-censorship court and regulatory decisions that came to rely on evidence-based social scientific proof for censorship policy decisions. This culminated in passage of the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993, and marginalised their campaign. The SPCS has issued media releases opposing civil unions, hate speech bans, the repeal of section 59 of the Crimes Act, and the decriminalisation of sex work. The SPCS had repeatedly criticised Bill Hastings, while he was New Zealand's Chief Censor, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), and the Film and Literature Board of Review for what it believes to be their liberal application of censorship law. Some years ago SPCS submitted a number of film festival items to the Film and Literature Board of Review for reclassification, including, most notably, the French rape film \\"Baise-Moi\\". It contended the film should be banned, as it was by Australian censors. The campaign was initially successful, although after several appeals this film subsequently went on to general commercial release. The SPCS has also sought permanent bans of the films Kill Bill, Baise-Moi, Irreversible, Visitor Q, Bully, Ken Park, Anatomie de l'enfer, Twentynine Palms, Y Tu Mama Tambien, 9 Songs and The Piano Teacher, again on the basis of what the SPCS believed was their objectionable sexual and violent content. It has not succeeded in obtaining permanent bans of any of the above, however. In 2005, the SPCS unsuccessfully sought an R18 classification of the computer game Playboy: The Mansion. The SPCS applied for a review of the rating of The Passion of the Christ reduced to permit its exhibition to children provided they were accompanied by a parent despite criticisms of the film's graphic violence. This stance was criticised as being weak or even hypocritical. As a result of a review brought by Hoyts, the distributor of The Passion of the Christ, the film's classification was reduced from R16 to R15, which meant that most fifth-form (15-year-old) students could view it. Since 1995, the SPCS has taken sixteen appeals to the Film and Literature Board of Review and succeeded in three of them. In 1995 the SPCS succeeded in having one porn video banned and in 1996 it had scenes cut from another on appeal. Since then every appeal that the SPCS has sought has resulted in the same or a lower classification. Ironically, former Chief Censor Bill Hastings, whom the SPCS campaigned to remove from Office, was a member of the Board that allowed the two successful appeals. In 2006 the SPCS began to criticise the financial management of the OFLC. It complained to the Auditor General that the OFLC was inefficient and mismanaged taxpayer funds. The Auditor General dismissed the SPCS's complaint, stating that \\"no evidence of waste was found during the course of the audit\\" of the OFLC. SPCS is also strongly opposed to the promotion of equal rights for lesbians and gays. In 2000, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand ruled that the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 could not be interpreted to ban two American anti-gay videos produced by Jeremiah Films. The SPCS was not the originator of the appeal over the videos but was a strong supporter of the Court's decision. In 2011, the SPCS submitted Bruce LaBruce's gay horror film LA Zombie to the Film and Literature Board of Review for reclassification. The Board President, Dr Don Mathieson agreed with the SPCS that the film should be reclassified \\"objectionable\\" due to its major focus on graphic, gratuitous and offensive depictions of necrophilia - and other \\"sexual or physical conduct of a degrading or demeaning nature\\" and thereby banned. However, the remaining four Board members upheld the original R18 classification. Subsequently, the film was screened at Out Takes/Real Queer Film Festival run by Real Queer Inc in Auckland and Wellington.http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/20/article_10305.php See also *Censorship in New Zealand References Bibliography *New Zealand Administrative Reports (NZAR).

History It was created an urban district in 1927 by a merger of the former area of the Brentford Urban District and the Chiswick Urban District. It gained the status of municipal borough in 1932. It included the parishes of Chiswick, New Brentford and Old Brentford. In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its former area transferred to Greater London to be combined with that of other districts to form the London Borough of Hounslow. Brentford and Chiswick was also the name of the parliamentary constituency that covered the area. The seat survived until just before the February 1974 general election, when it was expanded westwards and renamed Brentford and Isleworth.  Coat of arms  Granted on 1 September 1932, the borough's coat of arms was: Per saltire argent and gules in chief a representation of St. Nicholas proper in base two bars wavy azure and in fesse as many seaxes (Saxon swords) the cutting edges inwards proper pommels and hilts or. Crest : Issuant out of a Saxon crown or a phoenix sable in flames proper. Supporters : On either side a griffin or gorged with a collar gemel wavy azure. The arms incorporate the emblems which appeared on the seal of the former UDC, which displayed the figures of St. Nicholas in reference to the dedication of the parish church, together with three seaxes from the arms of Middlesex County Council. The blue waves, like those on the supporters, represent the River Brent and the Borough's situation beside the River Thames. The phoenix represents the new Borough rising from the ashes of the old Urban District. The griffins appear to have no historical significance.

H. Lawrence. It was written in 1921 and first published by Martin Secker in March 1923 in a volume with The Ladybird and The Fox. It was the basis of the 1983 TV film of the same name with Jeremy Irons as the Captain. The story chronicles the journey of fallen German aristocrat Countess Johanna 'Hannele' zu Rassentlow as she dates a Scottish officer of unusual philosophy. The relationship develops into one of D. H. Lawrence's idiosyncratic 'wicked triangles'. The intimate relationship between Captain Alexander Hepburn and Hannele is intruded upon when the captain's wife Evangeline travels to Germany suspicious of foul play. The plot unfolds with two parallel narratives; one in the symbolic domain, the other a traditional short story narrative about these protagonists. The concurrent symbolic tale that unfolds centers around the central image of The Captain's Doll–after which the story gains its title. This doll is a striking portrait of the Captain, with his \\"slender legs\\" and mesmerizing dark stare encapsulated in the silks and calico of a lifeless, inanimate object. This doll is an ongoing motif throughout the story as it acts as a metaphor for the dehumanizing effects of war on Hepburn – an English gentleman who had been part of the war machine and in the aftermath has come to believe that \\"we are worth so very little\\". Another profound metaphor and image employed by Lawrence is the great 'glacier' described from afar to be \\"cold, angry\\" and a reflection of the captain's deep seated desire to subjugate Hannele and arguably conquer her \\"physically, sexually and from the inside\\" as she muses in free indirect speech narration. The couple ascend the mountain together, and the sheer enormity of this natural wonder prompts discussion of the smallness of a human being in comparison, bringing the captain to make megalomaniacal claims that he is indeed bigger than the mountain. He projects this onto the vast ice, its \\"soft flesh like\\" described with uncanny similarity to the earlier descriptions of Hannele swimming in the lake near her new home in Austria. Critics have debated the symbolic meaning of this ice monument, as the captain's determination to conquer it points to the obvious metaphorical domination of Hannele who \\"watches from below\\" as the crazed captain scrambles to the summit. Reaching the top, the captain is invigorated, yet Lawrence's narration becomes quite introspective of the transformation of the captain's worldview implicitly coupled with description of this barren vista of ice–\\"a world of ice\\"–that is \\"sufficient unto itself in its lifelessness\\". Akin to the gender commentary in The Fox on how the war had created a paradigm shift in the social roles within English society, this compelling narrative imparts to the reader a more intimate account of the death of a spirit and the dissemblance of class. The introduction of D. H. Lawrence, Three Novellas, an anthology that collates The Fox, The Captain's Doll, and The Ladybird, makes a comparison between the poetic works of Wilfred Owen and these stories as literary exploration of war that 'pity war'. This comes across in many of Lawrence's letters and implicitly in these texts, as each of the characters is in some way impacted by World War I. Lawrence must have been a keen observer of the social and personal ramifications of World War I, having written and published soon after the war, in 1923.

The film stars James McAvoy as a university student who wins a place on a University Challenge quiz team. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006, and was released in the UK and Ireland on 10 November 2006, and in Canada and the US on 23 February 2007. Plot In 1985, Brian Jackson is a first-year university student and information sponge. Since his working-class childhood in Southend-on-Sea, Brian has loved the TV quiz show University Challenge, with its famous catchphrase – \\"Your starter for 10\\". Soon after arriving at Bristol University, Brian attends a party where he meets left-wing Rebecca, with whom he has an instant connection. Brian attempts to join their University Challenge team but narrowly fails to secure a spot when he helps another candidate, Alice, cheat on the qualifying test. Brian falls for the glamorous Alice and tries to date her, despite her signals that she sees him as a friend. As term starts, Brian is invited to join the team after a member falls ill. The captain, Patrick, is a stuck-up post-grad who has remained captain despite never having achieved success on University Challenge. Brian impresses the team with his trivia knowledge and uses his time to get closer to Alice, eventually getting invited to her house for Christmas. Unfortunately, Brian embarrasses himself in front of her family by getting stoned while trying to impress Alice. He returns to Bristol to spend the rest of the vacation and meets Rebecca again. They again hit it off, but, as they are hooking up, he inadvertently calls her \\"Alice\\", offending her and ruining the moment. Following his romantic failures, he talks with Spencer, his friend from Southend, who tells him that he is in legal trouble. Brian invites him to a party before he has to face the judge. During the party, Patrick insults Spencer's upbringing and belittles him. Spencer hits Patrick in the face and disrupts the event. Afterwards, Brian shares a drink with Rebecca and tries to apologise for his own behaviour. However, Rebecca still feels Brian loves Alice and encourages him to follow his heart and tell Alice how he feels. He takes her advice and arrives at Alice's flat to declare his love, but discovers Spencer there. Excited by his violent behaviour at the party, Alice had invited him back. Brian feels betrayed by them both, since he had told Spencer how he felt about Alice. Brian gets depressed and struggles with concentrating during University Challenge practices and his studies, threatening his university place. Patrick becomes frustrated with Brian, and as they arrive for their University Challenge match, berates him for his lack of focus. Brian head butts Patrick in response, but only ends up knocking himself unconscious. He is revived backstage by Rebecca who has come to watch the show and gives him encouragement before he is escorted to the set. However, as he is being brought back to his team, Brian is briefly left with an open envelope containing the quiz questions. He reads one of the cards before putting it back in the envelope, and, inspired by the relative ease of the question, rejoins his team. The match starts off poorly, with nerves clearly getting to Patrick as he fails to answer several questions and puts the team in a hole. Brian slowly but surely digs them out of it, getting into his swing as he answers question after question. As the match is heating up and Brian's team has the momentum, Brian inadvertently gives the answer to the card that he had previously seen even before quizmaster Bamber Gascoigne has even begun to read the question (he has merely introduced it as \\"an astronomy question\\"). Realising that Brian has seen the cards, Gascoigne suspends the match and Brian's team is disqualified. Brian returns home and falls into another depression, sleeping all day and ignoring calls. His mother tries to get him out of the house, but the only person who finally reaches him is Spencer. He tells Brian that Gascoigne had gone easy on him, and that he is sorry for his behaviour and proud of Brian for chasing his dreams. Inspired by his friend, Brian returns to his studies and meets his tutor, promising he is back for good. He then stands Alice up to visit Rebecca at a demonstration. He asks her if she could ever forgive him for his mistakes, and if they can start again. She replies that he already knows the answer, and they kiss.

The University of Bristol Students Union building is in fact the university's School of Chemistry. The Granada TV studios are actually at the back of BBC Television Centre: the corridor (actually leading to the BBC multi-storey car park) was transformed for a day for the filming in 2005 with the addition of a Granada logo and pictures of past stars. The buildings at the end where a demonstration was held in which Brian tells Rebecca how much he likes her is the Queen Mary Court and King William Court at the University of Greenwich. Brian's home is shown as a slightly run-down seaside house, supposedly located in Westcliff-on-Sea. These scenes were actually filmed in the small village of Jaywick, near Clacton-on-Sea, with the real Westcliff bearing little resemblance to its onscreen depiction. Clacton Pier was used for the scenes set on the pier at Southend-on-Sea. Reception The film received positive reviews, with a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 78 reviews; the site's consensus states: \\"Starter For 10 is a spirited coming-of- age tale that remains charming and witty even as it veers into darker territory. The unique setting of a quiz show makes the film wittier than your average romantic comedy.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack features music from The Cure, The Smiths, The Psychedelic Furs, Buzzcocks, Yazoo, Motörhead, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Undertones, Tears for Fears, The Style Council and Kate Bush, among others.https://www.soundtrack.net/album/starter-for-10 The song \\"Ace of Spades\\", which appears at the beginning of the film, was performed by Motörhead in the \\"Bambi\\" episode of The Young Ones, filmed in Bristol, that included the University Challenge spoof.

Boundaries and background The urban district was created on their mass creation in 1894 on approximately the same boundaries of the medieval parishes of the same names. A town hall was completed in 1905. It gained the status of municipal borough in 1932. In 1894 the two parishes were formed into one urban district except for the small minority of Heston north of the Grand Junction Canal , which was transferred to Southall Urban District.In 1894, after the two parishes had been formed into one urban district, the part of Heston north of the Grand Junction Canal (114 a.) was transferred to Southall urban district In 1934, the minority of Cranford parish east of the Crane was added to the borough and overall generous adjustments were made in its boundaries with Twickenham, Brentford and Chiswick, and Southall-Norwood. Areas also included within boundaries Before 1894 but in the late 19th century new ecclesiastical parishes, hence neighbourhoods in the traditional definition, had been legally recognised within the large parishes: four in Hounslow and churches in Spring Grove and Osterley parts of Isleworth.The benefice of Spring Grove St Mary The Church of England. Retrieved 2014-10-27 Due to the multitude of other competing settlement names within these catch-all original parishes: * Old Isleworth * Spring Grove * Osterley * Syon Lane * North Hyde * Sutton Green * Hounslow * Hounslow East * Hounslow West * Lampton * Worton * Wyke * Scrattage (completely defunct) there is substantial overlap today in these and varied preference for names of London neighbourhoods, and the wards of the United Kingdom may conflict with definitive personal preference, such as use of the 19th century names in planning the estates in this area, Conservation Area names, individual development names, or original hamlet names. Successor In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its former area transferred to Greater London to be combined with the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick to the east and the Feltham Urban District to the south-west to form the London Borough of Hounslow. Minor loss of land, much smaller than any single original parish, took place on 1 April 1965 to the new London Boroughs of Ealing and Richmond upon Thames. Coat of arms The arms of Heston and Isleworth were granted in 1932. They were: Tierced in pairle Azure, Sable and gules in chief two wings conjoined argent to the dexter a cross bottonée or and to the sinister a lion rampant guardant per fesse of the last and or the fourth. The motto was 'UNITATE FORTIOR' (Latin: Stronger by union). The silver wings on blue referred to Heston Aerodrome. The gold cross bottony came from the seal of the Monastery of St. Saviour and St. Brigit of Syon, founded in 1416 at Twickenham by King Henry V and moved to the site on which Syon House now stands circa 1431. The gold and silver lion came from the arms of Hounslow Priory, founded in the thirteenth century by the Trinitarian Brothers of Redemption, on the site now occupied by Holy Trinity Church. The motto referred to the union of the two formerly separate parishes of Heston and Isleworth.

History The locomotive was produced in the years 1957–1960 in three types: 20E1, the prototype, 30E1 and 30E2. In need of modern electric locomotives for passenger trains, and unable to get timely delivery of EU06 locomotives from England, Poland bought 30 locomotives from its southern neighbours. In 1969, PKP started testing several changes to enable EU05 locomotives to achieve speeds up to . First trials were made with the EU05-29 locomotive, and soon it became clear that it was possible to safely achieve speeds up to after changing the transmission rate. The decision was made to rebuild all locomotives of EU05 class during first servicing. As a result, by 1977 almost all locomotives had been rebuilt to EP05 class, except for locomotives 09, 12 and 19, which had been scrapped earlier. To distinguish the new series from its predecessor, the color scheme was changed from two- tone green to orange. All modifications were conducted in Zakłady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego in Gdańsk. In the beginning of the 1980s, EP05 was being prepared for pulling express trains. Most of the engines had had multiple steering and pneumatic devices installed, which allowed them to pull trains with two connected locomotives and operate automatic fixtures. First express train, Górnik (En.: miner) led by EP05 locomotive run in 1984 on Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa, achieving a top speed of . In the second half of the 1980s the top speed on Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa rose to and as a result EP05 could run at top speed. Some of those engines later had their clutch changed from Secheron to Skoda. =Present day= Following the introduction of EP09 locomotives, EP05 started to be withdrawn from service, but due to several break downs of EP09 it was postponed. Today only one unit (EP05-23) of this locomotive still run under PKP Cargo, pulling InterCity trains. There is also one unit of EU05 left in service, which is in fact EP05-22 engine repainted in 2003. It serves as an exhibit in Kraków. As of 2018, it has been restored and re-entered regular service, at speeds of 160 km/h. EP05-23 Re- entered regular Service As an Active Exhibit In 2017. Repainted Back To The Orange Livery in the same year, EP05-23 unit is owned by PKP Intercity Technical data EP05 series locomotive is a passenger electric locomotive able to pull passenger trains.

The specific operating system and executable format determine how the dynamic linker functions and how it is implemented. Linking is often referred to as a process that is performed when the executable is compiled, while a dynamic linker is a special part of an operating system that loads external shared libraries into a running process and then binds those shared libraries dynamically to the running process. This approach is also called dynamic linking or late linking.  Implementations  = Microsoft Windows = Dynamic-link library, or DLL, is Microsoft's implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension \`DLL\`, \`OCX\` (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or \`DRV\` (for legacy system drivers). The file formats for DLLs are the same as for Windows EXE files that is, Portable Executable (PE) for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, and New Executable (NE) for 16-bit Windows. As with EXEs, DLLs can contain code, data, and resources, in any combination. Data files with the same file format as a DLL, but with different file extensions and possibly containing only resource sections, can be called resource DLLs. Examples of such DLLs include icon libraries, sometimes having the extension \`ICL\`, and font files, having the extensions \`FON\` and \`FOT\`. =Unix-like systems using ELF, and Darwin-based systems= In most Unix-like systems, most of the machine code that makes up the dynamic linker is actually an external executable that the operating system kernel loads and executes first in a process address space newly constructed as a result of calling \`exec\` or \`posix_spawn\` functions. At link time, the path of the dynamic linker that should be used is embedded into the executable image. When an executable file is loaded, the operating system kernel reads the path of the dynamic linker from it and then attempts to load and execute this other executable binary; if that attempt fails because, for example, there is no file with that path, the attempt to execute the original executable fails. The dynamic linker then loads the initial executable image and all the dynamically-linked libraries on which it depends, and starts the executable. As a result, the pathname of the dynamic linker is part of the operating system's application binary interface. Systems using ELF In Unix-like systems that use ELF for executable images and dynamic libraries, such as Solaris, 64-bit versions of HP-UX, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD, the path of the dynamic linker that should be used is embedded at link time into the \`.interp\` section of the executable's \`PT_INTERP\` segment. In those systems, dynamically loaded shared libraries can be identified by the filename suffix \`.so\` (shared object). The dynamic linker can be influenced into modifying its behavior during either the program's execution or the program's linking, and the examples of this can be seen in the run-time linker manual pages for various Unix-like systems. A typical modification of this behavior is the use of \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` and \`LD_PRELOAD\` environment variables, which adjust the runtime linking process by searching for shared libraries at alternate locations and by forcibly loading and linking libraries that would otherwise not be, respectively. An example is zlibc,https://www.zlibc.linux.lu/ also known as \`uncompress.so\`, which facilitates transparent decompression when used through the \`LD_PRELOAD\` hack; as a result, it is possible to read pre- compressed (gzipped) file data on BSD and Linux systems as if the files were not compressed, essentially allowing a user to add transparent compression to the underlying filesystem, although with some caveats. The mechanism is flexible, allowing trivial adaptation of the same code to perform additional or alternate processing of data during the file read, prior to the provision of said data to the user process that has requested it.  macOS and iOS  In the Apple Darwin operating system, and in the macOS and iOS operating systems built on top of it, the path of the dynamic linker that should be used is embedded at link time into one of the Mach-O load commands in the executable image. In those systems, dynamically loaded shared libraries can be identified either by the filename suffix \`.dylib\` or by their placement inside the bundle for a framework. The dynamic linker not only links the target executable to the shared libraries but also places machine code functions at specific address points in memory that the target executable knows about at link time. When an executable wishes to interact with the dynamic linker, it simply executes the machine-specific call or jump instruction to one of those well-known address points. The executables on the macOS and iOS platforms often interact with the dynamic linker during the execution of the process; it is even known that an executable might interact with the dynamic linker, causing it to load more libraries and resolve more symbols, hours after it initially launches. The reason that a macOS or iOS program interacts with the dynamic linker so often is due both to Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs and Objective-C, the language in which they are implemented (see their main articles for more information). The dynamic linker can be coerced into modifying some of its behavior; however, unlike other Unix-like operating systems, these modifications are hints that can be (and sometimes are) ignored by the dynamic linker. Examples of this can be seen in \`dyld\`'s manual page. A typical modification of this behavior is the use of the \`DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH\` and \`DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES\` environment variables. The former of the previously-mentioned variables adjusts the executables' search path for the shared libraries, while the latter displays the names of the libraries as they are loaded and linked. Apple's macOS dynamic linker is an open-source project released as part of Darwin and can be found in the Apple's open-source \`dyld\` project. =XCOFF-based Unix-like systems= In Unix-like operating systems using XCOFF, such as AIX, dynamically-loaded shared libraries use the filename suffix \`.a\`. The dynamic linker can be influenced into modifying its behavior during either the program's execution or the program's linking. A typical modification of this behavior is the use of the \`LIBPATH\` environment variable. This variable adjusts the runtime linking process by searching for shared libraries at alternate locations and by forcibly loading and linking libraries that would otherwise not be, respectively. = OS/360 and successors = Dynamic linking from Assembler language programs in IBM OS/360 and its successors is done typically using a LINK macro instruction containing a Supervisor Call instruction that activates the operating system routines that makes the library module to be linked available to the program. Library modules may reside in a \\"STEPLIB\\" or \\"JOBLIB\\" specified in control cards and only available to a specific execution of the program, in a library included in the LINKLIST in the PARMLIB (specified at system startup time), or in the \\"link pack area\\" where specific reentrant modules are loaded at system startup time. = Multics = In the Multics operating system all files, including executables, are segments. A call to a routine not part of the current segment will cause the system to find the referenced segment, in memory or on disk, and add it to the address space of the running process. Dynamic linking is the normal method of operation, and static linking (using the binder) is the exception. Efficiency Dynamic linking is generally slower (requires more CPU cycles) than linking during compilation time, as is the case for most processes executed at runtime. However, dynamic linking is often more space- efficient (on disk and in memory at runtime). When a library is linked statically, every process being run is linked with its own copy of the library functions being called upon. Therefore, if a library is called upon many times by different programs, the same functions in that library are duplicated in several places in the system's memory. Using shared, dynamic libraries means that, instead of linking each file to its own copy of a library at compilation time and potentially wasting memory space, only one copy of the library is ever stored in memory at a time, freeing up memory space to be used elsewhere. Additionally, in dynamic linking, a library is only loaded if it is actually being used.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 490. It is in the North East Derbyshire district of the county. The village sits on a prominent hilltop three miles (5 km) south of Chesterfield. It is composed of two villages formerly known as North Normanton and Little Normanton. It is close to the villages of Heath, Holmewood, Grassmoor and the civil parish of Sutton cum Duckmanton. The Chesterfield suburb of Hasland is close by. The Manor of Normanton at the time of the Domesday Survey was in the hands of the King. Later, it passed to the Order of the Knights Templar from whom it derived its prefix 'Temple'. When the Knights Templar were dissolved in the early 14th century, the land and property of the village passed to the Order of the Hospital of St. John at Yeaveley Preceptory. Later, Henry VIII charged the Order of St. John with disloyalty, and it was dissolved. The village then passed to the hands of the crown. In 1846, Robert Arkwright was Lord of the Manor and principal owner. At the time the village had of land, 29 houses and 132 inhabitants. In the Borough Library at Derby is held a parchment roll comprising 70 sheets stitched together. This records the proceedings of the Manor Court of Temple Normanton from 1447 to 1518. John Babbington is mentioned as a Knight of St. John, and many of the roads listed in the roll are still traceable on present day Ordnance Survey maps. Early in the industrial age the area became known for coal mining, with numerous collieries located in the vicinity. These included the massive Bonds Main Colliery which lasted from 1896 to 1949. The Chesterfield loop of the Great Central Railway also ran through the area, opened in June 1892. A Bonds Main Platform was provided for mine workers, but the nearest public station was located at Grassmoor and this closed in October 1940, the line itself closing to passenger traffic in March 1963. Sections remained for a while serving the various collieries but as these closed so the line disappeared completely. Modern Temple Normanton includes a primary school, a church, a cemetery and an MOT garage, but no shops. There are also regular buses to Chesterfield, Alfreton, Mansfield and Nottingham.

It formed part of the London suburbs, lying within the Metropolitan Police District and the London Passenger Transport Area. In 1965 it was abolished on the creation of Greater London. Urban district The urban district was created on 1 April 1915, and consisted of the civil parishes of Beddington and Wallington. The parishes had previously formed part of Croydon Rural District, but the rural district was broken up by an order made by Surrey County Council on 13 September 1913 and confirmed by the Local Government Board on 18 November 1914. The neighbouring County Borough of Croydon made an attempt to annex Beddington, but its private bill was defeated in parliament.The County Borough Problem - Croydon and Wimbledon schemes, The Times, April 9, 1914 The urban district council was initially based at 37 Manor Road, the former offices of Wallington Parish Council. In 1929 they purchased a house on Woodcote Road, Wallington, as the site of a new town hall. The architect chosen was Robert Atkinson, and the building was formally opened on 21 September 1934. Incorporation In March 1936 the urban district council petitioned the privy council for the grant of a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough. The petition was successful, and the royal charter was presented to the charter mayor, Sir Richard Meller MP by Lord Ashcombe, the Lord Lieutenant of Surrey at a ceremony in Beddington Park attended by 10,000 people on 15 September 1937. Borough council The council had a membership of twenty-eight, comprising twenty-one councillors and seven aldermen. The councillors had a three-year term, with seven retiring annually. Aldermen had a six-year term, with half being chosen by the council every three years. The council elected one its members to the office of mayor annually. Elections were suspended from 1939 to 1944 due to the Second World War. From its first election in 1937 the borough council was under independent control. The Conservative Party, which was dominant in parliamentary politics in the area, did not contest elections in the borough, so that the nominal \\"independents\\" were generally elected by Conservative supporters. The first council election took place on 1 November 1937, and resulted in councillors being elected under the \\"Independent\\", \\"Ratepayers' Association\\" or \\"Residents' Association\\" labels. The Labour Party failed to have any councillors elected. The three groups on the council subsequently formed a single Independent bloc, and held all seats on the council until 1952. In that year there was a nationwide swing to Labour, and the party had two councillors elected, against twenty-six independent councillors and aldermen. Until 1960 there was a small Labour group on the council, never having more than three members. In that year the Independents regained all seats on the council. In the following years both Labour and a resurgent Liberal Party were able to gain a foothold on the council. After the final elections in 1963 the strength of the parties was: Independent 20, Labour 5, Liberal 3. Coat of arms The borough council was granted arms by the College of Arms on 3 July 1937.Municipal Borough of Beddington and Wallington (Civic Heraldry) accessed 15 Jan 2008 Across the centre of the shield was a \\"fess embattled\\", representing the fortified walls of the reputed Roman town of Noviomagus at Woodcote. The Tudor roses stood for Henry VIII and Elizabeth I who visited the seat of the Carew family of Beddington. The small shield or \\"inescutcheon\\" in the centre of the arms bore an aeroplane flying over a rising sun. This recorded the presence of Croydon Airport in south Beddington. The blue and gold border denoted that the district formed part of Surrey, and was derived from the arms of the de Warenne family, sometime Earls of Surrey. The crest above the shield was an armoured arm in the act of throwing down a gauntlet. This recalled that the manor of Wallington was anciently held by the Dymock family, who were Hereditary Champions of England.C W Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 Abolition The borough was abolished in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963, with its area becoming part of the London Borough of Sutton in Greater London.

The database was created to facilitate research related to publishers, mass communications, research institutes, libraries, and freelancers.  Nichigai Associates  Nichigai Associates (日外アソシエーツ株式会社) was founded in 1965. Its purpose has been to facilitate the acquisition of accurate information. In 1969, Nichigai Associates started a technical information retrieval service and began publishing the encyclopedias, indices, and directories. Following the current digitalization, its main service has been various online databases, such as WHO series, MAGAZINEPLUS and BOOKPLUS, among others. The databases focus on providing the information regarding prominent figures, bibliographies, magazines, awards, translation, and other reference materials.  Nichigai WHO Series  Nichigai WHO has four series: WHO I, WHO II, WHO III, Sakka shippitsusha jinbutsu file (作家・執筁E��E��物ファイル, lit. Writers EFile), and the latest WHOPLUS. This WHO series is divided by fields of occupational activity. WHO I catalogs important figures in economics, society, and politics, WHO II in academic research, literary, and journalism, and WHO III in arts, entertainment, and sports. The Sakka shippitsusha jinbutsu file compiles over 36,000 writers, critics, journalists, and researchers in humanities and social sciences from Meiji period to the present. However, the Sakka shippitsusha jinbutsu file service had finished in March 2006.  Nichigai WHOPLUS  =WHO and Jinbutsu Odan File= Nichigai WHOPLUS is divided into two categories: WHO and Jinbutsu odan file (人物ファイル横断, lit. Figures Cross- reference). WHO provides a full text search with the option to post limits while Jinbutsu odan file searches name headings and full text. =WHO= WHO is a database that catalogs profiles and bibliographic information of over 260,000 prominent figures. The profiles includes their notations and readings of names, occupations and position titles, date of birth and death, academic backgrounds, personal history, and awards among others. Two search methods are available: one is the full text search (全文検索) and the other is the advanced search (条件指定, lit. search by limiting the subjects). If searching Tsuda Umeko by full text, 19 figures related to Tsuda Umeko will be displayed as the search results. If searching Tsuda Umeko, limiting by female, deceased, and Japanese, only Tsuda Umeko will appear as the result. Subject includes full text search by profile, name of the figure, gender, living or deceased, the area of occupational activity, the year of birth and death, place of employment, position title, contact information, hometown, affiliated college, and nationality. Bibliographic information of the figures are divided into three parts; Jinbutsu bunken, Tosho, and Kiji ronbun. Jinbutsu bunken (人物文献, lit. Literature Concerning Figures) catalogs the books and articles writing about the searched figure. Tosho (図書, lit. Book) and Kiji ronbun (記事・論文, lit. Magazine and Academic Articles) lists the books and articles that the searched figure wrote. Search results in Tosho and Kiji ronbun are based on the results of BOOKPLUS and MAGAZINEPLUS. The result page lists the National Diet Library call numbers which facilitate the book and article search at NDL. =Jinbutsu Odan File= Jinbutsu odan file is a database that combines the function of WHO database with five other databases: *Jinbutsu reference jiten (人物レファレンス事典, lit.

URL Collection) lists the URL of figures selected exclusively by staff of WHO.  Characteristics  WHO includes not only scholars but also actors, artists, athletes, musicians, politicians, and writers. Although there is no indication of the time range, it roughly covers from ancient times to the present. Unlike printed encyclopedias, information provided in WHO is updated. The bibliographic information page is marked with date of the last update. Nevertheless, the frequency of the update varies. Some bibliographic information was last updated in 1988, while others in 2005. The bibliographic information provided in WHO is self provided and verified by each figure for accuratacy, except for deceased, non-Japanese, and public figures. Advanced search allows the users to limit various subjects in order to find the figures. One may search for a certain type of person without specifying any names. For instance, by checking female, deceased, Japanese, musician, and Naha-shi, five deceased female musicians in Naha-shi, Okinawa, will be found.

Typically, the women involved are married and non-working. Normally the lunch is in a high-class restaurant, but could also take place in a department store during a shopping trip. Sometimes the lunch takes place under the pretext of raising money for charity. History The origins of the phrase are disputed. Some claim it was coined by Women's Wear Daily publisher John Fairchild in the 1960s, others that it was first introduced in the January 19, 1970, issue of New York magazine by the writer Merle Rubine, > \\"Anyone with a fair figure, ready cash, fashion savvy and a safecracker's > nerve can buy the best that Fifth Avenue has to offer on Seventh Avenue at > half the price. The girls at Condé Nast and Harper's Bazaar have known this > for years. Likewise the ladies who lunch at Restaurant X, although they'd > rather be banished from the banquette than admit they got their Beenes and > Blasses on a bargain basis.\\" '' The phrase was later popularized by a song of the same name in Stephen Sondheim's 1970 musical Company. The character Joanne, played by Elaine Stritch, a rich, cynical, middle-aged woman, makes a drunken toast to her peer group in The Ladies Who Lunch. The lyrics offer a sardonic toast to rich women, including herself, who fill their time with frivolous things like luncheons and parties. The song has given the phrase \\"ladies who lunch\\" a negative connotation. Joanne's condemnation of women who are \\"off to the gym, then to a fitting, claiming they're fat\\" does not paint these women in a generous light. Ladies who lunch are often seen as lacking substance. Other cultural references “Ladies Who Lunch” was the title of a sketch on the Season 36 premiere of Saturday Night Live hosted by Amy Poehler. In the sketch, four upper-class women, played by Amy Poehler, Kristen Wiig, Vanessa Bayer and Abby Elliott, eat lunch at the fictional restaurant Chez Henri. Sylvia (Wiig's character) is constantly upstaged by Trish (Poehler's character). Bayer's character and Elliott's character fawn over Trish's tiny hats. Sylvia gets jealous and also attempts to wear small hats, but Trish pulls crazy stunts and is always able to upstage Sylvia. At the end, Trish pulls the biggest stunt of all and fakes her own death, winning the approval and amusement of her friends and causing Sylvia to realize that she cannot best Trish.Saturday Night Live, Season 36, Episode 1 The title alludes to the frivolity of the lives of socialites. The women only seem to care about the next trend in fashion and little about their actual friends. The ABC television series Desperate Housewives featured an episode entitled \\"The Ladies Who Lunch\\". The show has named several episodes after songs by Stephen Sondheim. It was originally aired as Episode 16 on March 27, 2005. In Arrested Development, The Balboa Bay Window, which is a fictitious high-culture magazine made up for the purpose of the show, features the byline \\"The Magazine of The American Society of Ladies Who Lunch - A Lot.\\" The novel The Ladies Who Lunch: A Middle Aged Women's Guide to Modern Morality by Ruth L.

It is bordered to the west by the Sierra Nevada, to the east by the Cowtrack Mountains, to the north by the Bodie Hills, and to the south by the north ridge of the Long Valley Caldera.Mono Basin, Mono County, California Estimates of the size of the basin range from 634 to 801 square miles, and the basin's elevation ranges from around 6,380 feet (level of Mono Lake as of 1986) to 13,061 feet atop Mount Dana near the Sierra Crest. Notable features in the basin include Mono Lake and the Mono-Inyo Craters, as well as the town of Lee Vining. Geology Geologically the basin is a structural basin that is bordered to the west by the frontal fault of the Sierra Nevada. The basin is part of the Walker Lane, an area where much of the deformation between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate occurs. The basin was created by geological forces over the last five million years by crustal stretching of the Basin and Range province and associated volcanism and faulting at the base of the Sierra Nevada. Five million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was an eroded set of rolling hills and Mono Basin and Owens Valley did not yet exist. From 4.5 to 2.6 million years ago, large volumes of basalt were erupted around what is now Cowtrack Mountain (east and south of Mono Basin); eventually covering and reaching a maximum thickness of . Later volcanism in the area occurred 3.8 million to 250,000 years ago. This activity was northwest of Mono Basin and included the formation of Aurora Crater, Beauty Peak, Cedar Hill (later an island in the highest stands of Mono Lake), and Mount Hicks. The area remains volcanically active today, with Paoha Island forming from volcanic activity 350 years ago.

History Pedestrian area separated from carriageway by six bollards in front of the East India House in London, 1766 Although curbs have been used throughout modern history, and indeed were present in ancient Pompeii, their widespread construction and use only began in the 18th century, as a part of the various movements towards city beautification that were attempted in the period. A series of Paving Acts in the 18th century, especially the 1766 Paving and Lighting Act, authorized the City of London Corporation to create footways along the streets of London, pave them with Purbeck stone (the thoroughfare in the middle was generally cobblestone) and raise them above street level with curbs forming the separation. The Corporation was also made responsible for the regular upkeep of the roads, including their cleaning and repair, for which they charged a tax from 1766. Previously, small wooden bollards had been put up to demarcate the area of the street reserved for pedestrian use. By the late 18th century, this method of separating pedestrians from carriageways had largely been supplanted by the use of curbs. With the introduction of macadam roads in the early 19th-century, curbs became ubiquitous in the streets of London. Curbs present an obstacle for accessibility to physically disabled persons in public spaces. In 1945, Jack Fisher of Kalamazoo, Michigan, celebrated the installation of one of the nation's first curb cuts to facilitate mobility in the center of the city. In the United States, activism and passage of federal legislation on accessibility requirements such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) have facilitated travel for wheelchair users and other people. Function gutter, storm drain, and an accessibility ramp between roadway and pedestrian sidewalk transit vehicles Curbs may fulfill any or several of a number of functions. By delineating the edge of the pavement, they separate the road from the roadside and discourage drivers from parking or driving on sidewalks and lawns. They also provide structural support to the pavement edge. Curbs can be used to channel runoff water from rain or melted snow and ice into storm drains. There is also an aesthetic aspect, in that curbs look formal and \\"finished\\". Since curbs add to the cost of a road, they are generally limited to urban and suburban areas, and are rarely found in rural areas except where certain drainage conditions (such as mountains or culverts) make them necessary. Curbs are not universally used, however, even in urban settings (see living street). Safety In low-speed environments, curbs are effective at channeling motor vehicle traffic and can provide some redirective capacity for low-speed impacts. On higher speed roads, the main function of curbs is to provide drainage, and they are mostly used in areas of a bridge approach or other locations with erosion risk. A high-speed vehicle that hits a curb may actually turn towards the sidewalk, rather than be directed away from it. A vehicle that strikes a curb can also be tripped into a rollover crash or vaulted into the air.To be tripped into a rollover, a vehicle generally must slide into the curb at least partly sideways, so that the leading wheels that are sliding on the road catch on the curb; then the wheels cannot pass over the curb, but if the upper body of the vehicle is moving fast enough, it will continue over the curb, so that the vehicle will rotate (roll) on an axis more or less parallel to the curb. The minimum speed for this to happen in a given curb-collision scenario gets lower as the height of the vehicle's center of gravity--including its load--gets higher. The vehicle could be vaulted over a traffic barrier into the object the barrier is intended to shield. This is a reason why they are rarely used on rural or high speed roads. Where curb is used with a traffic barrier, the barrier should either be close to or well behind the curb, to reduce the chances of a vehicle going over the barrier. Depending on the area and the distance between the travel lane and the edge of pavement, an edge line can be used to indicate the outside (shoulder) edge of the road. Retroreflective road marking material can also be applied to the curb itself to make it more conspicuous. Curbs are also meant to inform pedestrians to stop or slow down as they prepare to cross roadways. For example, cultural context and behavioral norms of a society may affect safety in that people are more likely to cross on a red light while standing alone than waiting with others at the curb. Types of curb Old sidewalk with granite curb in Kutná Hora Modern use of stone curbs, cobblestone, and planters as bollards to separate vehicles from pedestrians in Warsaw There are a number of types of curb, categorized by shape, material, height, and whether the curb is combined with a gutter. Most curb is constructed separately from the pavement, and the gutter is formed at the joint between the roadway and the curb. Combined curb and gutter (also called \\"curb and channel\\") has a concrete curb and gutter cast together in one piece. \\"Integral curb\\" is curbing constructed integrally as a part of a concrete pavement. =Shape= Curbs often have a vertical or nearly-vertical face, also called \\"barrier\\", \\"non-mountable\\", or \\"insurmountable curb\\". Vertical- faced curb is used to discourage motor vehicle drivers from leaving the roadway. The square (90°-edge) or close-to-square type is still almost always used in towns and cities, as it is a straight step down and thus less likely to be tripped-over by pedestrians. By contrast, a slope-faced curb allows motor vehicles to cross it at low speed. Slope-faced curb is most often used on major suburban thoroughfares. In certain locales, such as California, there is an effort to standardize the design to achieve efficiencies in construction and lower costs. Trends include using a gutter that balances the increased initial price with lower maintenance costs. At crosswalks and other pedestrian crossings, narrow dropped curb cuts are used to allow small wheeled vehicles such as wheelchairs, children's tricycles, prams, and strollers to cross. This makes it easier to traverse for some pedestrians, and especially for those in wheelchairs. Wider curb cuts are also used to allow motor vehicles to cross sidewalks at low speed, typically for driveways. In Great Britain, \\"high containment kerbs\\" are used at locations with pedestrians, fuel station pumps, and other areas that need greater protection from vehicle traffic. These are high - much higher than standard curb, with a sloped lower portion and a concave face. These are also known as \\"trief\\" curbs. Rounded curbs are most often used at driveways, and continuously along suburban residential streets where there are many driveways and the sidewalk has a grassy setback from the street. This type of curbing starts out nearly flat like the road, curves up in a concave manner to a gentle slope, then curves back in a convex manner to nearly flat again, making it much easier to drive over, and is also known as a \\"rolled\\" or \\"mountable curb\\" in some localities. These types of curbs are preferred by builders because they are less expensive than installing straight curbs and gutters. They are easier to lay using concrete and require less forming as steel templates can be used with only front and back forms needed. Their use also eliminates the need for driveway cuts, curbs, and aprons, thus further reducing costs. =Material= Metal forms before the concrete is poured and finished by hand Hand forming at catch basins Curbs are constructed of many materials, including asphalt, stone or masonry blocks, but most often are made of Portland cement concrete. The type of material may depend on the type of paving material used for the road and the desired function or need. For example, a Portland concrete curb used with an asphalt concrete road surface provides a highly visible barrier at the edge of the road surface. Other types of curb material include stone slabs, cobblestone, and manufactured pavers. Concrete curb may be constructed by setting forms by hand, filling them, letting them set up, and then removing the forms. When large quantities of curb are to be constructed, it is often more efficient to use a slip form casting machine. Curbs can also be precast at a central location and trucked to the construction site. Asphalt curb is usually made with a paving machine. It can be cheaper if it is formed at the same time that a road is paved, but is less durable than concrete curb. Stone curb, often made from granite, is durable and resistant to de-icing salt. It is also chosen for aesthetic reasons. In areas where granite is available, it may be cheaper than concrete curb. One disadvantage of granite curb is that it can cut a tire sidewall if it is rough-faced. Belgian block curbs are made by placing blocks over a concrete slip. Then, more concrete is wedged in between the blocks to hold them together. These blocks can be vertical, or angled in order to create a mountable curb. = Height = slip casts a concrete curb with integral gutter When designing a curbed roadway, engineers specify the \\"reveal\\" or \\"lip\\". The reveal is the height of the section that is visible (revealed) above the road surface. Typical reveals are in the range. Curbs at handicapped curb cuts (or \\"kerb ramps\\", for example in Australia) should have no reveal. One of the recommendations has been using a 4/12 batter in to accommodate automobile design because steeper batters tend to interfere with body trim, hubcaps, and lower door edges while curb faces in excess of in height may prevent the full opening of car doors. Most curb extends down into the ground below the pavement surface, to improve their stability over time. The total height, including the buried portion, is often . =Integral gutter= Curbs with integral gutters are used where better hydraulic flow performance is needed. However, this places a longitudinal joint (parallel to the direction of travel) near where bicyclists often ride. If the main roadway and gutter settle differently over time, the vertical edge that develops at the joint can cause a hazard for bicyclists. Auto racing curbs Curbs at the Suzuka International Racing Course In auto racing, curbs are flat curbstones lining the corners or chicanes of racing tracks. They are often painted red and white, and are intended to prevent unauthorized short-cuts and keep the racers safely on the track. Although they are not considered part of the racing track, drivers sometimes \\"ride the curbs\\" in order to maintain momentum and gain a time advantage in cornering. Cultural identifiers In certain parts of the world curb design signifies cultural association. For instance, in countries of the former Portuguese Empire such as Brazil, curbs are often distinctively decorated (along with the footpaths more broadly) in a style known as Portuguese pavement, marking a clear link to Portugal, where the style originated. More explicitly, curbstones can be painted (by official sanction or otherwise) to stress an identity or ideology; for instance in Northern Ireland curbstones are frequently painted in communities to identify a religious/political affiliation - typically either red, white, and blue for Unionist/Loyalist areas, and green, white, and orange for Nationalist areas.

The gateway into Heath Village The civil parish is called Heath and Holmewood. The population of this parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 2,953.  Location  Heath is immediately adjacent to junction 29 of the M1 motorway and the A617 dual carriageway into Chesterfield. Close to Heath are the villages of Holmewood and Temple Normanton. The village is also near to Stainsby, host of the annual Stainsby Festival, and to the Sutton cum Duckmanton civil parish, which contains several villages, including Sutton Scarsdale. As a result of the construction of the M1 Motorway in the 1960s, and more recently the A617 into Chesterfield, many of the linking roads from Heath to its neighbouring villages were severed. These severed roads still exist. History In the Domesday Survey of 1086, two settlements are recorded around the present location of the village of Heath; they were called Lunt and Le Hethe. The two villages probably combined during the 12/13th century. However, relatively little change has taken place since then; maps from around 1609 show the village in almost its present layout. The manor of the village was in the possession of Robert de Ferrars, the First Earl of Derby, who gave it to the monks of Garendon Abbey. It remained in their possession for almost 400 years. It then became bequeathed by Henry VIII to Thomas Manners, then to various families following him. In the village, there are two buildings listed as Grade II, meaning they are of special archeological and historical interest. There is a thatched cottage located near to the entrance of the former Heath Comprehensive School. The second building is the remains of the original 12th-century church, which is separated from the village by the dual carriageway. Much of the village is maintained by the Chatsworth Estate,Chatsworth . accessed 2 October 2010 with the traditional \\"Chatsworth Blue\\" doors and window frames signifying the properties leased from the estate. The village had a railway station on the Great Central Railway, which partly followed the route taken by the A617. Both the line and the station closed in the 1960s as part of the 'Beeching axe'. The buildings in the village are constructed mainly from the local cream- coloured sandstone, coupled with a variety of traditional roofing materials. In May 1977, the village was designated a conservation area.  Customs  Heath The Church of England is represented by All Saints Church, which has close links with St Albans in nearby Holmewood. Both congregations share the same vicar. Heath Modern education is provided by Heath Primary School which has stood on the site along Slack Lane since 1867, when boys and girls were taught in separate schools, but now a modern primary with Nursery and child care facilities.  Economy  The Elm Tree Public House with Heath C of E Church in the background The village of Heath once hosted a blacksmith, a cobbler, three public houses and a Post Office (closed in November 2009); only The Elm Tree public house and a petrol station on the outskirts of the village now remain. Many of the revamped private residences retain the names of the previous existence, such as The Old Reading Room and Smithy Cottage.

Technical details EU06 has driving cabs at both ends. The locomotives are equipped for multiple working which allows one driver to drive two coupled engines from one cab. One locomotive can haul passenger trains of up to at and freight trains of up to at a speed of . Two locomotives coupled in multiple can haul a freight train of up to . These figures apply to driving on level gradients. All members and panels are made of Cor-Ten steel and the underframe is a shallow, cellular structure with closely spaced light-gauge longitudinal and transverse members plated above and below to make a set of closed cells. The body sides are built up on rectangular vertical tubes forming a set of pillars and are double-skinned for additional strength and rigidity. This maintains the shape of the locomotive allowing the roof of the entire machine space between the two cabs to be removed to allow machinery to be lifted out and replaced. The superstructure is built to withstand buffing loads up to . English Electric made extensive use of aluminium alloys and GRP for panelling, doors and ducts. Current collection is by single-pan air operated pantographs, which feed the main power circuits by a high-speed circuit breaker. The main resistances were made by Metropolitan-Vickers' parent company, Associated Electrical Industries. The four traction motors are permanently connected in series pairs, with series-parallel combinations between pairs. Parallel and 12 field weakening positions give a total of 55 running notches. The four traction motors have Alsthom quill drives. The minimum curve radius that the locomotives can negotiate is : any curve tighter than this could cause severe flange wear on the wheels. In order to reduce flange forces, the bogies are linked by a tubular-framed spring-loaded inter- coupling and flange lubricators are fitted to each wheel. History In 1936–1938 the Contractors' Committee, a joint venture of Metropolitan-Vickers and English Electric, had supplied six electric locomotives and 80 three-car electric multiple units for the electrification of Warsaw suburban services. British Insulated Cables supplied the overhead line equipment. In 1945 British Insulated merged with a competitor to become British Insulated Callender's Cables, and in 1949 Metropolitan-Vickers, English Electric and BICC contracts to replace locomotives, EMUs and equipment damaged in the Second World War. In the early 1950s PKP urgently wanted mixed-traffic electric locomotives for the rapid electrification of Poland's railways. ET21 freight locomotives were already in production but there was a lack of passenger locomotives. The plan was to buy several items of foreign-built locomotives and a license and start domestic production afterwards. In 1956 talks with companies from Austria and Switzerland started, but were broken off soon after. In June 1959 Poland awarded a new contract to for overhead electrification and 20 locomotives to the Contractors' Committee, which now included BICC as well as AEI Traction and English Electric. The contract included a licence agreement for Poland to manufacture 2,000 tons of copper contact wire, enough to electrify of railway. Not all electric devices were included in the licence agreement. EU06 locomotives are roughly similar to the British Rail Class 83 mechanically, which were built by English Electric at Vulcan Foundry, Newton-le-Willows in the UK, in the same period; electrically the layout and equipment was similar to classes 5E/5E1/6E/6E1 operating on South African Railways. The first EU06 locomotive was delivered to Poland early in 1962 and after series of trials it was assigned to Kraków Prokocim depot. Seven locomotives had been delivered by the end of April 1962 and 19 by the end of the year. Delivery of the last locomotive was delayed until 1965 by failures of the armature. The locomotives were operated on all lines serviced by Kraków Prokocim depot. Class EU06 was an innovative design that became a milestone in Polish motive power construction. Along with the EU07, a similar locomotive class built in Poland under licence by Pafawag in Wrocław and Ciegielski in Poznań, almost 500 locomotives were built. EU07 locomotives were also used to build the duplex freight locomotives of PKP class ET41. Several construction innovations from class EU06 were introduced into later classes such as EP08, ET22 and EP09. The Last EU06 unit traveled from Žylina to Katowice on March 31, 2009, in the middle of December 2010, 7 out of the 14 remaining locomotives were scrapped on Kraków Prokocim Cargo Station, Those 7 locomotives were: EU06-02, EU06-04, EU06-05, EU06-08, EU06-11, EU06-14 and EU06-16. The 1st locomotive (EU06-01) ended its service in 2004, due to its locomotive technical performance certificate expiring. In the same year in 2012, EU06-01 became an active monument in Chabówka Railway Heritage Park. The Rest of the active locomotives are left off, mostly awaiting better times, which are mostly main repairs. Liveries English Electric delivered the EU06 class in a two-tone green, with a broad dark green waistband on a pale green body. In recognition of the locomotives being built in the UK, it was hoped that one example of the class would be repainted in British Rail Electric Blue livery, complete with BR Lion and Wheel insignia. Instead, an EU07 /EP07 — EP07-1051 — was painted in the livery in February 2008.

It was Heckler & Koch's entry into the U.S military's Close Assault Weapon System program. It is a 10-round, 12-gauge, bullpup shotgun with two firing modes: semi-auto and full-auto. The gun is fully ambidextrous. Development The development of the HK CAWS started in response to the JSSAP requirement for Repeating Hand-held Improved Non-rifled Ordnance (RHINO),Hogg, Ian V. Jane's Infantry Weapons 1993-1994. Jane's Information Group. 1993 which itself grew out of the Special Operations Weapon (SOW) project.https://medium.com/war-is-boring/for-three-decades-the- pentagon-tried-and-failed-to-build-sci-fi-shotguns-81c32d22674e RHINO specified a magazine capacity of 10 rounds, a requirement for the new ammunition to be incompatible with commercial 12ga shotguns, that felt recoil to be no greater than a Remington 870P firing M162 or M257 buckshot cartridges and that the system provide penetration and incapacitation capability significantly better than M162 and M257. In response Olin and Winchester developed a belted brass cartridge, containing 8 tungsten alloy pellets fired at and capable of penetrating pine or mild steel plate barrier at 150 m. These cases were also capable of being loaded with 000 Buckshot or with flechettes. Olin, in support of HK's CAW, also offered a fléchette load, using twenty much smaller projectiles at a high velocity of approximately http://ww2.rediscov.com/spring/VFPCGI.exe?IDCFile=/spring/DETAILS.IDC,SPECIFIC=11807,DATABASE=objects, By the early 1980s the CAWS program had taken over from RHINO. The main goal of this program was to develop a new generation personal firearm, capable of firing high-impulse, multiple projectiles with effective range of 100–150 meters. Using multiple projectiles should increase the chances of hitting the target in combat. One of the teams entered in the CAWS race was Heckler & Koch Germany, coupled with Winchester Corp. United States.http://www.hkpro.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=101:caw&catid;=11:rare- prototypes&Itemid;=5 Heckler & Koch was responsible for developing a weapon, while Winchester was responsible for the development of new types of ammunition. The resulting firearm designed around the Olin cartridges was the HK CAWS. With an outer casing of high impact plastic like HK's previous G11, the weapon was designed to reduce recoil through the use of an interior 'floating recoil system'. Despite the bullpup design, it was designed for ambidextrous use with ambidextrous fire selectors and safety levers and ejection converted from right to left by rotating the bolt head 180°. The chamber was configured to accept the proprietary belted cartridges as well as commercial 12ga rounds and the barrel could be fitted with a choke or choked barrel extension. The carry handle covers the cocking handle similar to the AR-10, and housed an optical sight which could be converted to a rail sight. Although tested by the U.S. military, and beating out the AAI Corporation's, Pan Associates' and Atchisson's entries into the competition, the CAWS was canceled, and production, both military and civilian, has halted.http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=75 See also * SCMITR - another product of the CAWS program from AAI * AAI CAWS - another product of the CAWS program from AAI * List of bullpup firearms * List of shotguns * List of individual weapons of the U.S. Armed Forces References External links * Cartridge of the Month June 2006: 12 Gauge Close Assault Weapon System (CAWS) * HKPRO: The CAW * Modern Firearms * Military Factory: Heckler & Koch HK CAWS Category:Bullpup shotguns Category:Flechette firearms Category:Abandoned military projects of the United States Category:Automatic shotguns HK CAWS Category:Trial and research firearms ","title":"Heckler &amp; Koch HK CAWS"},{"id":"3600304","title":"Winsor &amp; Newton"},{"id":"3600306","text":"The , abbreviated , is a national expressway in Japan.

It is based loosely on the short story, Shifu: You'll Do Anything for a Laugh () by Mo Yan; the story appears in English translation in the collection of the same title translated by Howard Goldblatt. Though the story and the film share a common opening, they begin to diverge almost immediately. Plot In the city of Dalian, an old and laid-off factory worker (played by Zhao Benshan) seeks to marry an obese and divorced middle-aged woman (Dong Lifan), who he hopes will bring him warmth and comfort in life. So he sets out desperately to find a way to make money for the posh wedding he has promised. The hapless man and his friend (Fu Biao) decide to renovate a broken bus on top of a hill that is popular for romantic couples. He turns this bus into a small dwelling he names \\"Happy Times Hotel,\\" which he will rent to willing couples visiting the hill. As he brags about his newly opened \\"hotel\\" and how much money he is making, he finds himself entrusted with the care of the woman's emaciated, blind stepdaughter Wu Ying (Dong Jie), who is unwanted in the house. Not willing to expose his scheme and ruin his attempt to get married, the man enlists the help of his retired co-workers, who agree to do all they can to make the lonely girl happy at her new job as a masseuse in the \\"hotel.\\" As the story unfolds, a touching friendship between the childless man and the dejected, orphaned girl under his care develops, leading to a moving and surprising conclusion. Although the film was criticized as sentimental, it has a sharp eye for the absurdities generated both by China's socialist past, and by the encroaching capitalism. The two endings, one for the domestic audience and the other for the international audience, suggest a bleak future for those left behind in China's rush to power and wealth.

The site's consensus reads: \\"One of Zhang's smaller films, Happy Times is nevertheless moving and bittersweet.\\" Derek Elley of Variety called it \\"a modern-day character comedy with a touching edge\\", comparing it to 1960s European character comedies.

Two types of devices are currently common: frequency doublers, often based on lithium niobate (LN), lithium tantalate (LT), potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) or lithium triborate (LBO), and frequency triplers typically made of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Both are widely used in optical experiments that use lasers as a light source. Harmonic generation There are two processes that are commonly used to achieve the conversion: second- harmonic generation (SHG, also called frequency doubling), or sum-frequency generation which sums two non-similar frequencies. Direct third-harmonic generation (THG, also called frequency tripling) also exists and can be used to detect an interface between materials of different excitability. For example, it has been used to extract the outline of cells in embryos, where the cells are separated by water.Nonlinear microscopy and tissue morphogenesis Laboratoire d'Optique et Biosciences, École Polytechnique, France Lasers Optical frequency multipliers are common in high-power lasers, notably those used for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments. ICF attempts to use a laser to heat and compress a target containing fusion fuel, and it was found in experiments with the Shiva laser that the infrared frequencies generated by the laser lost most of its energy in the hot electrons being generated early in the heating process. In order to avoid this problem much shorter wavelengths needed to be used, and experiments on the OMEGA laser and Novette laser validated the use of frequency tripling KDP crystals to convert the laser light into the ultraviolet, a process that has been used on almost every laser-driven ICF experiment since then, including the National Ignition Facility.

The story is also similar to other folk and fairy tales where the hero picks up several allies (or sometimes items or skills) and uses them in the exact order found. The original version of Drakestail was told in French as Bout-d’-Canard in the book Affenschwanz et Cetera by Charles Marelle in 1888, translated into English in the Red Fairy Book by Andrew Lang in 1890. The Tale Drakestail initially finds a coin, but is immediately requested to donate it to the King (with the promise of a future repayment). When a certain length of time passes, he heads for the palace. Along the way, he sings: *Quack! Quack! Quack! When shall I get my money back? In quick succession, Drakestail meets four friends, a fox, a ladder, a river, and a bees' nest. In each, the exchange is essentially the same: *\\"Where are you going?\\" *\\"I'm going to see the King.\\" *\\"Can I come too?\\" *\\"It is a long way.\\" *\\"I'll make myself small and go down into your gullet, and you can carry me.\\" (Various versions of the tale would phrase it differently, and some have Drakestail offering the ride instead of merely agreeing to it.) When Drakestail reaches the palace, he asks to see the King. The King, having already spent the coin (along with several years' taxes) with nothing to show for it, says to throw Drakestail in the chicken yard. The chickens attack, but Mr. Fox comes out and kills them. Similarly, the ladder saves Drakestail from a well and the river saves him from the furnace. Each time he returns to the palace gates and says: *Quack! Quack! Quack! When shall I get my money back? Finally, the King decides to sit on Drakestail. The bees' nest comes out and either stings him to death or causes him to jump out a window to his death. Drakestail hunts for his money and cannot find it; however, when the townsfolk arrive to petition the King, they rejoice that he is dead and make Drakestail the new King. The Appeal of Repetition While adults might find such stories tedious (we can easily put together what's going to happen), children tend to adore repetitious stories, since they can more easily remember and repeat the lines. This allows interaction and builds a strong framework for the plot progression. Sources *Quackling Online.

Life Liu He was the founding emperor Liu Yuan (Emperor Guangwen)'s son, likely oldest son, by his first wife Empress Huyan. According to the Book of Jin, Liu He was described as having an imposing, handsome and sturdy look, and was about 1.96 meters tall, he was studious, but suspicious and miserly. Liu He was created the Prince of Liang (梁王), a title that he was posthumously known for as well, in 308. In early 310, Liu Yuan created him crown prince. Before Liu Yuan died later in 310, he commissioned his sons and Liu He's brothers Liu Yu (劉裕) the Prince of Qi, Liu Long (劉隆) the Prince of Lu, and Liu Ai (劉乂) the Prince of Beihai with substantial troops at the capital, in addition to the large army that another son, Liu Cong the Prince of Chu, already had, with intent that they assist him with governance and military matters. A group of officials, both Xiongnu and Chinese, were given various responsibilities in assisting Liu He. However, three officials were left out—Liu He's uncle Huyan You (呼延攸), Liu Cheng (劉乘) -- who had prior grudges with Liu Cong—and Liu Rui (劉銳) the Prince of Xichang. They were disgruntled, and they persuaded the already suspicious Liu He that he could not be safe if his brothers maintained large forces in or near the capital. Three days after Liu Yuan's death, under Liu He's orders, these officials commenced surprise attacks on Liu He's four brothers—Liu Rui against Liu Chong, Huyan You against Liu Yu, Liu Cheng against Liu Long, and Tian Mi (田密) and Liu Gui (劉璿) against Liu Ai. Once Tian and Liu Gui got on the way, however, they did not attack Liu Ai but instead escorted him to alert Liu Cong, who then prepared for the confrontation. Liu Rui withdrew his troops. Over the next two days, Liu Yu and Liu Long were defeated and killed. Two days later, Liu Cong sieged the palace and killed Liu He, Liu Cheng, Liu Rui, and Huyan. After initially offering the throne to Liu Ai, Liu Cong then assumed the throne himself.

It is the largest zoo of Pakistan and second oldest zoo in the country after Lahore Zoo. History Karachi Zoo, established in year 1878, was commonly called as 'Mahatma Gandhi Garden'. Earlier in 1861, the zoo was transferred to municipality by the British Indian government. In 1878, the municipality placed the zoo under a trust to be developed out of public subscription. Later, the zoo was once again opened to public in 1881. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the name was changed to 'Karachi Zoological Gardens' or 'Karachi Zoo' for short. In 1953, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation introduced a zoo curator and a qualified veterinary doctor. In 1991-2 CDGK for remodelling of Natural History Museum, which was carried out. In 1992, the Japanese Princess inaugurated the remodeled Natural History Museum. In 2008, total employees of Karachi Zoo is about 240 staff members. Areas and attractions *Elephant House is the most famous exhibit in the zoo. A 65-year-old Asian elephant, named 'Anarkali', died on 19 July 2006. Two female African bush elephants arrived at the zoo on 16 May 2010 from Karachi Safari Park. Both were born in Tanzania in 2007 and have been named 'Noor Jahan' and 'Madhu Bala'. *Natural History Museum, renovated in 1992, is one of the more famous attractions in Karachi Zoo. Apart from stuffed animals, skins, antlers, horns and feathers etc. are also placed on display in the museum. The facility is used by zoology students for research and educational purposes. *Reptile House was extended and renovated in 1992. It is one of the few reptile houses in Pakistan. There are 13 species of snakes and lizards. Newly born hatchlings of testudines and crocodilians are also exhibited. *Veterinary Hospital was established in 1998 in Karachi Zoo with modern diagnostic facilities. There is an operation theatre, equipped with X-ray and sonogram facilities, multiple sick bays, a laboratory and an incubation room. *Mughal Garden, established in 1970, has green lawns with seasonal plants that occupy a major part of the garden accompanied with Mughal-style fountains.

They are also the public face of the production, and responsible for addressing issues that arise due to the production's impact on the community.  Duties  Historically, the duties of the Location Manager were the responsibility of the Assistant Director. As the film industry grew, a need was identified for greater oversight, to allow ADs to focus on the internal aspects of the set. A dedicated person focusing on external influences was first seen in the 1950s on large studio features, and became common in the industry by the late 1970s. The first job of a location manager is managing the location scouting of a project, usually supervising several scouts and assistant managers during the course of a show. A location manager will work closely with the director and the production designer during preproduction to find and secure their creative vision, and oversee additional scouts to insure that all scripted locations are accounted for. The manager is also responsible for public relations at the locations used, and the safety of the crew during filming. A \\"location scout\\" is responsible for the initial scouting of all the locations used in a film, and translates the writer and director's vision for the feel of the scene into a viable and appropriate location. An experienced location scout will take into account all the logistics necessary for the production to function. Some items that a location scout must be aware of before submitting a location for approval are the budgetary restrictions of the production, local permitting fees and regulations, camera and lighting requirements, convenience to other locations, production services, crew and unit parking, and possibly incidental issues such as direction of the sun, traffic in and around the location, aircraft flight paths, weather patterns, road work, demonstrations, and even interest by local organized crime families. The Sorcerer's Apprentice, the storage spot was lower Broadway in Manhattan Once a location has been determined to have the appropriate appearance, the location manager must schedule dates for preparation, wrap and strike, and negotiate with the property owner an appropriate fee as well as fees to neighbors and tenants that may be impacted by production. The location manager will also apply for the necessary permits through the local municipality and/or community and housing associations, arrange parking for trucks, equipment and crew, prepare temporary facilities for holding production, talent, crew and meals, and ensuring the security of the location, the safety of the crew while minimizing the impact to the surrounding community. Good location managers are well- poised and able to think on their feet as they are constantly moving, usually preceding production at a location, and overseeing final strike and wrap. They are the first and last people the public sees that represent the production, and are responsible for ensuring that the location is returned to the condition in which it was received. The location manager is also to be aware of the possible copyright issues which may be an issue if the show is filmed in a public place where there is art work or such, and where the artist has to give consent to the creation being depicted or covered or replaced by other artwork. They need to be aware of the production's needs and know how to best accommodate them while diplomatically ensuring that the requirements of all parties, from the property owners, line producer, director and production designer, to the grip and electric teams lighting and rigging the set, and their teamster brothers with their trucks, trailers and vans.  Employment  In Hollywood, they are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 399, and in New York and Chicago they are represented by the Directors Guild of America (DGA) for features and television work. In New York Commercials, they are represented by Teamsters Local 817. In Georgia, location managers are represented by the Teamsters Local 728. In New Mexico location managers are members of IATSE 480. Additionally, there is the Location Managers Guild International, a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and interests of their members and their relations with the general public, communities and industry partners. Location Managers are commonly associated with production as being part of the management of a show and as such, are generally paid a weekly salary as opposed to an hourly wage. The average salary can vary depending on the experience of the individual and can range from a couple hundred dollars a day on low-budget films to almost a thousand dollars a day on commercials.  Recognition  The California Film Commission has recognized the work of Location Managers with the California On Location Awards (COLA) since 1995, producing an annual awards show celebrating the best Location Professional, Team, and Public Servant in Film, Television, and Commercials. The Location Managers Guild held their inaugural awards show in 2014 to honor the outstanding creative contributions of location professionals around the world, currently held in conjunction with the AFCI Location Show in Los Angeles, CA.

These mastodon-like ungulates include the genera Baguatherium, Carolozittelia, Colombitherium, Gryphodon, Propyrotherium, Proticia, and Pyrotherium. They had the appearance of large, digitigrade, tapir-like mammals with relatively short, slender limbs and five-toed feet with broad, flat phalanges. Their fossils are restricted to Paleocene through Oligocene deposits of Brazil, Peru and Argentina. Some experts place the clade Xenungulata (which contains several genera, including Carodnia) within Pyrotheria, even when dentition, although bilophodont in both orders, is very different. For most scholars, the two orders remain separated. The dentition is complete with strong, procumbent, chisel-shaped incisors, strong sharp-pointed canines, and low-crowned cheek teeth with bilophodont molars. The affinities of the Xenungulata remain uncertain. Affinities with the Dinocerata are strongly supported by the dental characteristics. Initial study of the structure of the tarsus suggested that the xenungulates had a common ancestry with typical pyrotheres, such as Pyrotherium, but a more recent examination of the tarsus of Pyrotherium failed to support this, instead showing some traits shared by Pyrotherium and the Embrithopoda. It remains to be seen which of these views will turn out to be right. This means that the Pyrotheria could be members of no less than three major cladistic branches of placential mammals: Meridiungulata (if xenungulates are the closest relatives), Laurasiatheria (if dinoceratans are the closest relatives) and Afrotheria (if embrithopods are the closest relatives).

It is the same concept as volume percent (vol%) except that the latter is expressed with a denominator of 100, e.g., 18%. The volume fraction coincides with the volume concentration in ideal solutions where the volumes of the constituents are additive (the volume of the solution is equal to the sum of the volumes of its ingredients).

He is co-author of the popular Freakonomics book series and host of Freakonomics Radio. Early life and education Born in 1963 in Duanesburg, New York to Solomon Dubner (also known as Paul) and Florence Greenglass (also known as Florence Winters and Veronica Dubner), Dubner grew up as the youngest of eight children. His father, who died in 1973 when Dubner was 10 years old, worked as a copy editor at the Troy Record. Dubner grew up in a devout Roman Catholic household, his parents having converted from Judaism to Catholicism before his birth. As an adult, Dubner himself converted to Judaism, an experience he chronicles in his first book, Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family. In 1984, Dubner graduated from Appalachian State University in North Carolina, where he studied in the College of Fine and Applied Arts. There, Dubner played in a rock band, The Right Profile, which later signed with Arista Records shortly before he decided against a career in music. In 1990, Dubner earned a Master of Fine Arts in Writing from Columbia University, where he also taught English.  Career  =Early work= Dubner's first published work appeared in Highlights for Children, when he was 11 years old. Since then, his journalism has been published in The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Time, and has been anthologized in The Best American Sports Writing, The Best American Crime Writing, and elsewhere. In 1998, Dubner authored his first full-length book, Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family, for which Dubner was named a finalist for the Koret Jewish Book Award. Dubner has since written Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper, published in 2003, and a children's book, The Boy With Two Belly Buttons, published in 2007. =Freakonomics book series= Dubner met Steven Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, when his editor asked him to write a profile on Levitt for The New York Times Magazine. At the time, Dubner was writing a book on the psychology of money and didn't have much interest in meeting the young economist from Chicago. Likewise, Levitt had little interest in the profile, but agreed to a two-hour interview because his Mom liked The New York Times Magazine. Upon meeting Levitt, Dubner extended the two-hour interview to three days. After publication of Dubner’s 2003 Times Magazine article, Dubner and Levitt were asked to write a book, which cemented their partnership. In 2005, William Morrow published Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, a book about cheating teachers, bizarre baby names, self-dealing Realtors, and crack-selling mama's boys. Freakonomics would go on to be translated into 40 languages and sell 5 million copies worldwide. Dubner and Levitt co-authored three other books: SuperFreakonomics (2009), Think Like a Freak (2014), and When to Rob a Bank (2015). Throughout their authorship, Dubner and Levitt use economics to explore real-world phenomena, answer perplexing questions, and offer unconventional analysis. = Freakonomics Radio = In 2010, Dubner launched a weekly podcast, Freakonomics Radio, which gets 15 million global monthly downloads as of 2018. On March 5, 2020, Dubner appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast. Dubner also hosts Freakonomics Radio Live! (formerly Tell Me Something I Don’t Know), a game show version of the podcast in which contestants share incredible, little known facts in front of a live audience.  Personal life  Dubner currently resides in New York City with his wife, documentary photographer Ellen Binder, their two children, and their dog. In a 2017 New York Times profile, Dubner described his ideal Sunday as one in which he walks his dog in Central Park early in the early morning, watches an FC Barcelona game with his son, and spends the afternoon cooking dinner with his daughter.

Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a political and feminist choice, and advocates lesbianism as a positive alternative to heterosexuality for women as part of the struggle against sexism. History Political lesbianism originated in the late 1960s among second wave radical feminists as a way to fight sexism and compulsory heterosexuality. Sheila Jeffreys helped to develop the concept when she co- wrote in 1981 \\"Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\\" with the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group. They argued that women should abandon support of heterosexuality and stop sleeping with men, while encouraging women to rid men \\"from your beds and your heads\\". While the main idea of political lesbianism is to be separate from men, this does not necessarily mean that political lesbians have to sleep with women; some choose to be celibate or identify as asexual. The Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group definition of a political lesbian is \\"a woman identified woman who does not fuck men\\". They proclaimed men the enemy and women who were in relationships with them collaborators and complicit in their own oppression. Heterosexual behavior is seen as the basic unit of the patriarchy's political structure, lesbians who reject heterosexual behavior therefore disrupt the established political system. Ti-Grace Atkinson, a radical feminist who helped to found the group The Feminists, is credited with the phrase that came to embody the movement: 'Feminism is the theory; lesbianism is the practice.'\\"Feminism is the theory, lesbianism is the practice.\\" (Chicago Women's Liberation Union pamphlet, Lesbianism and Feminism, 1971; Stevi Jackson, Sue Scott, Feminism and Sexuality: A Reader, Columbia University Press, 1996, p. 282) Shared Interest New wave feminism provided a platform for some women to come out of a perceived suffocating shell of heterosexual norms, traditional sexuality, marriage and family life, a life viewed by some feminists as one of hard labor with little consideration and a system that subordinates women. By coming out of dominating heterosexual relationships, women are given an opportunity to declare themselves as lesbians with shared interests. As a result, feminism would be able to provide an environment in which lesbianism was less about personal pain or anguish but an important political issue. In a broad sense, political lesbianism entails the political identification of women with women, it encompasses a role beyond sexuality but supports eschewing forming relationships with men. It is partly based on the idea that women sharing and promoting a common interest creates a positive and needed energy which is necessary to enhance and elevate the role of women in the society, a development which will be curtailed by the institutions of heterosexuality and sexism if women choose the traditional norms. Though there was some discrimination against lesbians within the feminist movement, it ended up providing a needed political platform for them. In its wake, it also expanded and introduced divergent views of sexuality.Ramazanoglu; Routledge, Feminism and the Contradictions of Oppression, Routledge, 1989. pp 84–86 Lesbian separatism Separatist feminism is a form of radical feminism that holds that opposition to patriarchy is best done through focusing exclusively on women and girls.Christine Skelton, Becky Francis, Feminism and the Schooling Scandal, Taylor & Francis, 2009 , p. 104. Some separatist feminists do not believe that men can make positive contributions to the feminist movement and that even well-intentioned men replicate the dynamics of patriarchy.Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value, p. 60, 154, 294. Charlotte Bunch, an early member of The Furies Collective, viewed separatist feminism as a strategy, a \\"first step\\" period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance personal growth.Davis, Flora. Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America since 1960, University of Illinois Press, 1999, , p271 The Furies recommended that Lesbian Separatists relate \\"only (with) women who cut their ties to male privilege\\"Bunch, Charlotte/The Furies Collective, \\"Lesbians in Revolt\\", in The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly, vol. 1, January 1972, pp.8–9 and suggest that \\"as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits\\". Social constructs of sexuality and criticism Some feminist theory on sexuality evaded biological fixation and embraced social construction as the basis of sexuality. However, this idea posed further questions on the subject of sexuality and lesbianism, and the long term sustainability of a purely lesbian society without men or children. If sexuality could be a construction of human nature then little room is given to understanding the nature of the historical formation of human nature, especially, if the historical nature of man or woman enhanced heterosexuality. A lack of theoretical clarity of lesbianism and sexuality becomes more profound as sexuality is viewed as much more than choice. Also, if lesbianism becomes a social institution, the avenue for a dominant persona in the relationships may also pose challenge to the original intention of political lesbianism.

The screenplay is based on the 1960 play of the same name by Santha Rama Rau, which was in turn based on the 1924 novel of the same name by E.M. Forster. Set in the 1920s during the period of the British Raj, the film tells the story of the interactions of several characters in the fictional city of Chandrapore, namely Dr Aziz, Mrs Moore, Adela Quested, and Cyril Fielding. When newcomer to India Adela accuses Aziz of an attempted rape within the famed Marabar Caves, the city is split between the British elite and the native underclass as the budding friendship between Aziz and Fielding is tested. The film explores themes of racism, imperialism, religion, and the nature of relationships both friendly and marital. This was the final film of Lean's prestigious career, and the first feature-film he had directed in fourteen years, since Ryan's Daughter in 1970. Receiving praise as Lean's finest since Lawrence of Arabia, A Passage to India received eleven nominations at the 57th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Lean, and Best Actress for Judy Davis for her portrayal as Adela Quested. Peggy Ashcroft won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal as Mrs Moore, making her, at 77, the oldest actress to win the award, and Maurice Jarre won his third Academy Award for Best Original Score. Plot Adela Quested is sailing from England to British Raj India with Mrs Moore, the latter the mother of her intended bridegroom, Ronny Heaslop; Mrs Moore's son from her first marriage. He is the City magistrate in Chandrapore, the anglicised spelling of Chandrapur. Adela intends to see if she can make a go of it. The ladies are disappointed to find that the British community is very much separated from the Indian population and culture with a growing Indian independence movement in the 1920s. They are encouraged when the local school superintendent Richard Fielding, brings into their acquaintance the eccentric elderly Hindu Brahmin scholar Professor Narayan Godbole. Mrs Moore meets by chance another Indian local, Dr Aziz Ahmed, a widower who is surprised by her kindness and lack of prejudice. Aziz offers to host an excursion to the local Marabar Caves. The initial exploration of the caves shows that the size of the party should be limited when Mrs Moore suffers from claustrophobia and the noise from the large entourage echoes exponentially inside the caves. Mrs Moore encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their exploration of the caves alone with just one guide. They reach the caves at a higher elevation some distance from the group and, before entering, Aziz steps away to smoke a cigarette. He returns to find Adela has disappeared. Shortly afterwards, he sees her running headlong down the hill, disheveled. She is picked up by the doctor's wife, Mrs Callendar, and taken to the Callendars' home. Adela is bleeding and delirious. Dr Callendar medicates Adela with a hypodermic syringe. Upon his return to Chandrapore, Aziz, accused of attempting to rape Adela at the caves, is jailed to await trial, and the incident becomes a cause célèbre. Mrs Moore firmly believes Aziz to not have committed any offence and she leaves India for England. At sea, Mrs Moore takes ill and dies quickly. In court, Adela is questioned by the prosecution; it becomes clear to her that her earlier signed accusation of attempted rape was incorrect and she recants. Aziz is celebrated for his innocence and Adela is abandoned to her own devices by the British except for Mr Fielding, who assists her to safety at the college. She plans to return to England at the earliest moment. Aziz rids himself of his western associations and vows to find a new job in another Indian state; he opens a clinic in the lake area near Srinagar, Kashmir. Meanwhile, through Adela, Fielding has married Stella Moore, Mrs Moore's daughter from her second marriage. Aziz eventually reconciles with Fielding, and Aziz writes to Adela asking her to forgive him for taking so long to come to appreciate the courage she exercised when she withdrew her accusation in court.

Forster began writing A Passage to India during a stay in India from late 1912 to early 1913 (he was drawn there by a young Indian Muslim, Syed Ross Masood, whom he had tutored in Latin), completing it only after he returned to India as secretary to a maharajah in 1921. The novel was published on 6 June 1924.Phillips, Beyond The Epic , p.405 It differs from Forster's other major works in the overt political content, as opposed to the lighter tone and more subdued political subtext in works such as Howards End and A Room With a View. A Passage to India deals with the delicate balance between the English and the Indians during the British Raj.Phillips, Beyond the Epic , p.406 The question of what actually happened in the caves remains unanswered in the novel. A Passage to India sold well and was widely praised in literary circles. It is generally regarded as Forster's best novel, quickly becoming a classic of English literature.Phillips, Beyond the Epic , p.403 Over many years several film directors were interested in adapting the novel to the big screen, but Forster, who was criticised when the novel was published, rejected every offer for the film rights, believing that any film of his novel would be a travesty. He feared that whoever made it would come down on the side of the English or the Indians, and he wanted balance. However he did allow Indian author Santha Rama Rau to adapt it for the theatre in 1957. David Lean had read the novel and saw the play in London in 1960, and, impressed, attempted to purchase the rights at that time, but Forster, who rejected Santha Rama Rau's suggestion to allow Indian film director Satyajit Ray to make a film, said no.Phillips, Beyond the Epic , p.407 Following Forster's death in 1970, the governing board of fellows of King's College at Cambridge inherited the rights to his books. However, Donald Parry, his executor, turned down all approaches, including those of Joseph Losey, Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, and Waris Hussein, who after adapting Santha Rama Rau's play for the BBC in the 1960s now wanted to make a feature film. Ten years later, when Professor Bernard Williams, a film enthusiast, became chief executor, the rights for a film adaptation became available. =Development= Producer John Brabourne, also known as John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne, whose father had been Governor of Bombay and later Governor of Bengal, and who was married to the daughter of Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy, had sought the film rights for twenty years. He and his business partner, Richard Goodwin, had produced Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) and films based on Agatha Christie’s mysteries, including the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express. In March 1981, Brabourne and Goodwin obtained the rights to make a film adaptation of A Passage to India. The contract stipulated that Santha Rama Rau write the screenplay and it reserved the right to approve the director. \\"Forster gave us a verbal go- ahead\\", remembered Goodwin later, \\"but my partner (John Brabourne) and I never got it in writing. So it was another 10 years before the Forster estate arranged the sale of film rights\\". Lindsay Anderson later claimed he turned down a chance to direct the film of the novel.LINDSAY ANDERSON BREWS SOME CHAOS New York Times17 Jan 1982: A.19. Brabourne, an admirer of the film Doctor Zhivago, wanted David Lean to direct the film. Lean was ready to break his 14-year hiatus from filmmaking following mostly negative reviews received for Ryan's Daughter in 1970. Since then, Lean had fought to make a two-part epic telling the true story of the mutiny on the Bounty, for which he could not obtain financing (the budget was an estimated $50 million), and had given some thought about doing a film adaptation of Out of Africa, from the book by Isak Dinesen, which Sydney Pollack ultimately directed in 1985. By September 1981, Lean was approved as director and Santha Rama Rau completed a draft of the script. =Writing= The contract stipulated that Santha Rama Rau would write the screenplay. She had met with E. M. Forster, had successfully adapted A Passage to India as a play, and had been charged by the author with preserving the spirit of the novel. However, Lean was determined to exercise input in the writing process. He met with Rau in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, and over ten days they talked about the novel and discussed the script. The initial script pleased neither the producer, John Brabourne, nor Lean. They considered it too worldly and literary, the work of a playwright, and unsuitable for a film. Most of the scenes took place indoors and in offices while Lean had in mind to film outdoors as much as possible. With India in the title of the film, he reasoned, audiences would expect to see many scenes filmed of the Indian landscape. Lean commented: “We are blessed with a fine movie title, A Passage to India. But it has built in danger; it holds out such a promise. The very mention of India conjures up high expectations. It has sweep and size and is very romantic”. Lean did not want to present a poor man's pre-independence India when for the same amount of money he could show the country's visual richness. During 1982, Lean worked on the script. He spent six months in New Delhi, to have a close feeling for the country while writing. As he could not stay longer for tax reasons, he then moved to Zurich for three months, finishing it there. Following the same method he had employed adapting Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations, he went through Rau's original script and his copy of the novel, picking out the episodes that were indispensable and passing over those that did not advance the plot. Lean typed out the whole screenplay himself, correcting it as he went along, following the principle that scripts are not written, but rewritten. =Casting= The director cast Australian actress Judy Davis, then 28, as the naive Miss Quested after a two-hour meeting. When Davis gave her interpretation of what happened in the caves — “She can’t cope with her own sexuality, she just freaks out” — Lean said that the part was hers. Davis had garnered international attention in Gillian Armstrong’s My Brilliant Career (1979) and had appeared in A Woman Called Golda (1982) as a young Golda Meir. Lean wanted Celia Johnson, star of Brief Encounter, to play Mrs Moore, but she turned down the part and died before the film was released. The director then offered the part to Peggy Ashcroft, a stage actress who had appeared in films only sporadically. She was not enthusiastic when Lean asked her to be Mrs Moore. \\"Mr Lean, I’m 75 years old\\", she protested. \\"So am I\\", he replied. Although she had recently worked in India on the TV miniseries The Jewel in the Crown, she said, \\"I thought, 'Oh dear, I really don’t want to do it', but it's very difficult to turn down a Lean film\\". Satyajit Ray, who had hoped to direct his adaptation of A Passage to India, recommended 38-year-old Bengali actor Victor Banerjee for the role of Dr Aziz. The character required a combination of foolishness, bravery, honour and anger. After some hesitation, Lean cast Banerjee, but the director had to overcome the restrictions of British equity to employ an Indian actor. Lean got his way, and the casting made headlines in India. \\"It was a matter of national pride that an Indian was cast instead of an Asian from England\\" observed Banerjee. Peter O'Toole was Lean's first choice to play Fielding. The role eventually went to James Fox. Despite having quarrelled with Lean in the 1960s about a proposed film about Gandhi that ultimately was scrapped, Alec Guinness agreed to portray Professor Godbole. The relationship between the two men deteriorated during filming, and when Guinness learned that much of his performance was left on the cutting room floor due to time constraints, he saw it as a personal affront. Guinness would not speak to Lean for years afterwards, patching things up only in the last years of Lean's life.Read, Piers Paul, Alec Guinness: The Authorized Biography. Nigel Hawthorne was cast as Turton but fell ill and was replaced on-set by Richard Wilson. =Financing= Financing the film was difficult. EMI provided some initial money, but Lean paid his own expenses scouting locations and writing the screenplay. Eventually the budget was raised from EMI, Columbia and HBO.LEAN'S 14-YEAR PASSAGE TO LOVE Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 10 Apr 1983: w21. In December 1984, Thorn EMI offered investors the chance to invest in several films by issuing £36 million worth of shares. The films were A Passage to India (1984), Morons from Outer Space, Dreamchild, Wild Geese II and The Holcroft CovenantWalker 1985 p286 (all 1985).Producer splits cost of films The Guardian 10 Jan 1985: 4. =Filming= Filming took place from November 1983 to June 1984. The Marabar Caves are based on the Barabar Caves, some 35 km north of Gaya, in Bihar. Lean visited the caves during pre-production, and found them flat and unattractive; concerns about bandits were also prevalent. Instead he used the hills of Savandurga and Ramadevarabetta some tens of kilometers from Bangalore, where much of the principal filming took place; small cave entrances were carved out by the production company. Other scenes were filmed in Ramanagaram (Karnataka) and Udhagamandalam (Tamil Nadu) and in Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir). Some interiors were shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey and in Bangalore Palace. =Music= The film's score was composed by longtime Lean collaborator Maurice Jarre. According to Jarre, the director told him, “Maurice, I want you to write music right from your groin for this very long scene in the cave. This isn't a story of India, it's a story of a woman. I want you to write music that evokes awakening sexuality.” Jarre wrote 45 minutes of music in two and a half weeks. He said, \\"David talks to me in images. A film artist never asks for an oboe to cover up a bad scene; a film artist doesn't think of music as medicine for a sick movie. David talks to me as he would talk to an actor.\\" Critical reception Lean's final film opened to tremendous praise worldwide, and became a critics' favourite of 1984. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"[Lean's] best work since The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia and perhaps his most humane and moving film since Brief Encounter. Though vast in physical scale and set against a tumultuous Indian background, it is also intimate, funny and moving in the manner of a film maker completely in control of his material . . . Though [Lean] has made A Passage to India both less mysterious and more cryptic than the book, the film remains a wonderfully provocative tale, full of vivid characters, all played to near perfection.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed that \\"Forster's novel is one of the literary landmarks of this century, and now David Lean has made it into one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen . . . [He] is a meticulous craftsman, famous for going to any length to make every shot look just the way he thinks it should. His actors here are encouraged to give sound, thoughtful, unflashy performances . . . and his screenplay is a model of clarity.\\" Variety called the film \\"impeccably faithful, beautifully played and occasionally languorous\\" and added, \\"Lean has succeeded to a great degree in the tricky task of capturing Forster's finely edged tone of rational bemusement and irony.\\" Time Out London thought the film was \\"a curiously modest affair, abandoning the tub-thumping epic style of Lean's late years. While adhering to perhaps 80 per cent of the book's incident, Lean veers very wide of the mark over E.M. Forster's hatred of the British presence in India, and comes down much more heavily on the side of the British. But he has assembled his strongest cast in years . . . And once again Lean indulges his taste for scenery, demonstrating an ability with sheer scale which has virtually eluded British cinema throughout its history. Not for literary purists, but if you like your entertainment well tailored, then feel the quality and the width.\\" Channel 4 said, \\"Lean was always preoccupied with landscapes and obsessed with the perfect shot – but here his canvas is way smaller than in Lawrence of Arabia, for instance . . . Still, while the storytelling is rather toothless, A Passage to India is certainly well worth watching for fans of the director's epic style.\\" A Passage to India holds a rating of 76% from 25 critics on Rotten Tomatoes. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A Passage to India is a visually striking exploration of colonialism and prejudice, although it doesn't achieve the thematic breadth of director David Lean's finest work.\\" The film is assigned an average score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 14 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Fossils of the order are known from deposits in Brazil, Argentina, Peru,Antoine et al., 2015 and Colombia. The best known member of this enigmatic order is the genus Carodnia, a tapir-like and -sized animal with a gait similar to living African elephants.  Description  Xenungulates are characterized by bilophodont M1–2 and M1–2, similar to pyrotheres, and complex lophate third molars, similar to uintatheres. Though other relationships, to arctocyonids for example, have been suggested, no proofs thereof have been found. The foot bones of xenungulates were short and robust and their digits terminated in broad, flat, and unfissured hoof-like unguals, quite unlike any other meridiungulates. The discovery of Etayoa in Colombia made it clear that xenungulates are distinct from other groups: Etayoa lacks lophate molar talonid (in contrast to Carodnia) and, since no distinct lophondonty is present in basal pyrotheres, there is reason to assume that bilophodonty evolved separately in xenungulates and pyrotheres. Xenungulates also show some dental similarity to primitive astrapotheres.  Taxonomy  grouped Carodnia with pyrotheres based on a similarity in astragalus morphology, but later concluded that this observation was incorrect. Notoetayoa is most closely related to Etayoa.

The system was introduced for steam stock by the Ministry of Railways on 3 November 1922, shortly after Poland regained her independence (1918), when the Polish railroads inherited a variety of German, Austrian and Russian steam locomotives, each with its own type convention. It was put into use in 1923–1926 years. The adopted solution allows telling the locomotive type (passenger/freight/mixed), wheel arrangement, origin and some other information from the type designation. After World War II a similar system was also adapted for diesel and electric locomotives. Electric and diesel locomotives An example of a locomotive designation: E stands for electric locomotive and T stands for freight locomotive. Next two numbers (22) describe six axles, Co-Co, direct current, 3 kV. Next three numbers after dash are an inventory number. Diesel (S) shunting (M) maneuvering locomotive, no multiple-unit control (01-09 number range) In case of electric and diesel locomotives, and multiple units, a designation consists of two capital letter and two digits, without a space between letters and digits. The first letter E or S indicates a kind of traction (electric or diesel), the second letter indicates a locomotive purpose. Digits mark subsequent classes, and their ranges also carry an additional information on construction features. Some railcar classes have three digits. =First letter= *E - electric locomotive () *S - diesel locomotive () =Second letter=  Locomotives  *P - passenger locomotive () *T - freight locomotive () *U - mixed-traffic locomotive ( - universal) *M - shunting locomotive () Electric multiple units *W - for high platforms () *N - for both high and low platforms () *D - for long distance traffic () Diesel railcars and multiple units * D - for long-distance traffic * N - for suburban traffic * R - special purpose (mobile workshops, emergency use etc.) * A - railbus () =Numbers= Electric locomotives *01-14 - four axles, Bo-Bo, direct current, 3 kV *15-19 - four axles, Bo-Bo, alternating current *20-34 - six axles, Co-Co, direct current, 3 kV *35-39 - six axles, Co-Co, alternating current *40-49 - other types In the case of electric and diesel locomotives consisting of two cars, the letters A and B were added after the serial number for each car but the number is still the same for both the cars, or after important modernisation (look for EU07A). Electric multiple units *51–64 – three-car set, 3 kV DC *65–69 – three-car set, AC *70–74 – four-car set, 3 kV DC *75–79 – four-car set, AC *80–89 – single electric car, any voltage or type of current *90–93 – two car sets, 800 V DC *94–99 – other Every car in a multiple unit is further designated by its own suffix: *s – (silnikowy) motor car (with or without a driver's cab) *d – (doczepny) trailer car without a driver's cab *r – (rozrządczy) trailer car with a driver's cab If there are more than one car of a given designation in a unit, they are further identified with letter 'a' or 'b'. For example, a typical 3-car EMU class EN57 consists of the following cars: * ra (trailer car with a driver's cab) * s (motor car, in this case without a driver's cab) * rb (trailer car with a driver's cab) Another 3-car EMU, class EW58, consists of the following cars: * sa (motor car, in this case with a driver's cab) * d (trailer car without a driver's cab) * sb (motor car, in this case with a driver's cab) Example of a single car's designation: EN57-830ra. Diesel locomotives *01–09 – mechanical transmission, no multiple-unit control *10–14 – mechanical transmission, multiple-unit control *15–24 – hydraulic transmission, no multiple-unit control *25–29 – hydraulic transmission, multiple-unit control *30–39 – electric transmission, no multiple-unit control *40–49 – electric transmission, multiple-unit control Diesel railcars and multiple units * 51–59 – mechanical transmission, no multiple-unit control * 60–69 – mechanical transmission, multiple-unit control * 70–79 – hydraulic or hydro-mechanical transmission, no multiple-unit control * 80–89 – hydraulic transmission, multiple-unit control * 90–94 – electric transmission, no multiple-unit control * 95–99 – electric transmission, multiple-unit control Steam locomotives Ty43 class locomotive designation: T stands for freight locomotive and y stands for 2-10-0 wheel set. 43 describes Polish production, 1943 year of design approval. Designations of standard gauge PKP steam locomotives consist of two letters (or three letters in case of tank locomotives) and a number written directly behind the letters. Designations of narrow gauge locomotives follow other rules. =First letter= The upper case letter means: *P - fast train locomotive () *O - mixed/stopping train traffic ( - passenger) *T - freight locomotive () =Last letter= Last letter (lower case) indicates the wheel arrangement, in increasing order of the number of driving axles. *a - one driving axle, any number of unpowered axles *b - 0-4-0 *c - 2-4-0 or 0-4-2 *d - 4-4-0 or 0-4-4 *e - 2-4-2 *f - 4-4-2 or 2-4-4 *g - two driving axles, more than three unpowered axles, *h - 0-6-0 *i - 2-6-0 or 0-6-2 *k - 4-6-0 or 0-6-4 *l - 2-6-2 *m - 4-6-2 *n - 2-6-4 *o - three driving axles, more than three unpowered axles *p - 0-8-0 *r - 2-8-0 or 0-8-2 *s - 4-8-0 or 0-8-4 *t - 2-8-2 *u - four driving axles, more than two unpowered axles *w - 0-10-0 *y - 2-10-0 *z - five driving axles, more than one unpowered axle =Middle letter= In the case of tank engines, the letters designating the type of engine and the wheel arrangement are separated by a K (upper case). Thus TKt48 is a 2-8-2T tank locomotive of Polish design introduced in 1948. =Number= *1-10 - German or Prussian origin steam engineTerczyński, Paweł (2003), Atlas parowozów, Poznań, , p. 30-31 (in Polish) *11-19 - Austrian origin steam engine *20-99 - Polish-ordered steam engine, number stood for the last two digits of the year in which the type was approved for production *100 - different atypical stock, acquired after 1945, including former private and industry locomotivesTerczyński, Paweł (2003), Atlas parowozów, Poznań, , p. 95 (in Polish) *101-199 - Other foreign steam engine, acquired by PKP between 1918 and 1939 (including German land railways other, than Prussian) *201-299 - Other foreign production steam engine, acquired by PKP after 1945 Serial numbers Following the letters and numbers described above, the serial number of each individual locomotive is stated. This consists of several digits, separated from the type designation characters by a dash. Tenders =First number= *First number of tender classification described water capacity in cubic meters made even upwards. =Letter= *Letter described the number of axles, i.e.: **B - two axles **C - three axles **D - four axles =Second number= *This referred to the year of construction, so number 23 means the construction was approved in 1923. Numbers 1 to 10 meant Prussian or German origin, 11 to 19 - Austrian origin, above 101 - other foreign origin. =An example= A tender numbered 22D23 can carry up to 22 m3 of water, has four axles, and its construction was approved in 1923.

It is the band's highest charting release on the Billboard album chart, peaking at No. 126. This album is markedly different from the previous two Crack The Sky releases, being largely written by Rick Witkowski with Joe Macre and Rob Stevens. Keyboardist/vocalist John Palumbo, who had previously composed all of Crack The Sky's material, departed the band early in the recording process for Safety in Numbers. Consequently, Palumbo is not credited as a band member on the finished album, though the re-organized group did end up using three of his songs (one a co-write with several other Crack The Sky members). To replace Palumbo, the band recruited Gary Lee Chappell to sing, and producer Rob Stevens to play keyboards. However, only the original band members (Joey D'Amico, Joe Macre, Jim Griffiths, Rick Witkowski) are pictured on the back cover of the album, with Chappell and Stevens relegated to one small photo each on the inside sleeve. There was a tour in support of the album (documented on Live Sky and Alive and Kickin' Ass), after which the band folded. In 1980, Palumbo and guitarist Rick Witkowski started a new version of the band and released White Music.

Together with him the alleged corrupters were convicted, in particular of Haemonetics Italia.L'ex ministro Sirchia condannato a tre anni The sentence refers only to the accusations concerning events after 2000, while for the previous ones there was a prescription. On 3 March 2010, the appeal ruling confirmed the embezzlement in relation to about 300,000 Swiss francs taken from the Il Sangue foundation of which he was treasurer, but acquitted him of the corruption charge. For a third charge, relating to $ 10,000 received from Japan's Kawasumi in December 2000, the judges finally declared the prescription; other disputes for which allegations of corruption were pending had already been declared prescribed during the first degree. The penalty was thus reduced to 5 months in prison and € 600 fine: the Court of Appeal of Milan has therefore lifted the ban on public offices against Sirchia.Sirchia: pena ridotta per appropriazione indebita, assoluzione per la corruzione See also *List of smoking bans References Sources *Corriere della Sera. \\"A sei anni dalla legge Sirchia: Meno \\"bionde\\", ma fumatori stabili\\", 7 January 2011 *La Repubblica. \\"Ministro della Sanità Girolamo Sirchia\\". 10 June 2001 External links *Official website Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:People from Milan Category:Italian hematologists Category:Italian Ministers of Health Category:University of Milan alumni ","title":"Girolamo Sirchia"},{"id":"3600535","text":"Pak Sadat Colony () is a neighbourhood in the Korangi District in eastern Karachi, Pakistan.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach- based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WXPX's studios are located on 66th Street North in Clearwater, and its transmitter is located in Riverview. History The station first signed on the air on August 1, 1994 as WFCT; the station was founded by Paxson Communications, which was renamed Ion Media Networks in 2007. It originally ran an all-infomercial format as an affiliate of the Paxson-owned Infomall TV Network (or inTV), and also carried programming from The Worship Network during the overnight hours. The station also broadcast games from the now-defunct Atlanta Knights minor league hockey franchise, which was affiliated with the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning. At the time, Paxson also owned a chain of radio stations in Florida. Paxson's Tampa Bay radio cluster regularly received commercial time on WFCT; this ended when Paxson sold off his radio and billboard businesses to fund start up operations for the Pax TV network. The station changed its call letters to WXPX-TV in 1998; the station then became a charter owned-and- operated station of Pax TV (which rebranded as i: Independent Television on July 1, 2006 and later to Ion Television on January 29, 2007) when it debuted on August 31 of that year, after which it rebranded as \\"Pax 66\\". The Worship Network and infomercial remained on the station's schedule but it also carried the network's family-oriented programming. From 2004 to 2008, WXPX became the over-the-air broadcaster of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Major League Baseball franchise, airing a number of games that were not televised on a national broadcast or cable network. It also carried NBA games from the Orlando Magic through the syndicated Magic Television Network. The rights to those games later exclusively moved to regional sports networks Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports. =Possible sale to Scripps= On September 24, 2020, the Cincinnati- based E. W. Scripps Company announced that it would purchase Ion Media for $2.65 billion, with financing from Berkshire Hathaway. With this purchase, Scripps will divest 23 Ion-owned stations, but no announcement has been made as to which stations that Scripps will divest as part of the move. The proposed divestitures will allow the merged company to fully comply with the FCC local and national ownership regulations. Scripps has agreed to a transaction with an unnamed buyer, who has agreed to maintain Ion affiliations for the stations. If Scripps decides to keep WXPX-TV, this would make it a sister station to ABC affiliate WFTS-TV (channel 28).http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/09/24/scripps-creates-national- television-networks-business-with-acquisition-of-ion- media-395300/20200924scripps01/E.W.

Newscasts and local programming In 2000, WXPX entered into a news share agreement with NBC affiliate WFLA-TV (channel 8) as a result of NBC's management agreement with Pax TV. Unlike other Pax stations that rebroadcast newscasts seen on the originating station on a half-hour delay at minimum, the WFLA newscasts aired on WXPX were initially broadcast live and produced specifically for the station; the newscasts, titled News Channel 8 on PAX, aired weeknights at 7 and 10 p.m. (the latter competed with Fox owned-and-operated station WTVT channel 13's longer-established in-house primetime newscast). Due to poor ratings of the live newscasts, in 2002, the newscasts switched to pre-recorded broadcasts of WFLA's 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts airing at 7 and 11:30 p.m. (WFLA attempted another 10 p.m. newscast five years later for WTTA, channel 38, in October 2007, which ran until its 2009 cancellation; WFLA launched its own 7 p.m. newscast in 2012).Tampa Bay Times: \\"After calls about an online job description, WFLA-Ch. 8 admits it plans a 7 p.m. newscast\\", July 17, 2012. The WFLA agreement ended on June 30, 2005, when Paxson dissolved news share agreements on all of its stations (which, with a few exceptions, mainly involved NBC owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, such as WFLA). The only local non-brokered programming currently seen on WXPX is a local public affairs program i on Tampa; the station also previously aired Miccosukee Magazine (which also aired on sister stations WPXM-TV in Miami, WPXP-TV in West Palm Beach and WOPX-TV in Orlando).

Airing at 105.7 FM, the station broadcasts an adult contemporary format for the Niagara region, as well as Buffalo, New York (since 2010, CHRE's signal in Western New York has been diminished due to adjacent-channel interference from WGWE/Little Valley, New York) branded as 105.7 EZ Rock. CHRE's studios are located on Yates Street in downtown St. Catharines, while its transmitter is located near Thorold. History CHRE was launched on March 20, 1967 as CHSC-FM by Radio Station CHSC Ltd., the licensee of the city's CHSC AM 1220. As CHSC-FM it simulcast much of its programming on CHSC AM. By 1970 the two stations were doing their own programming with CHSC-FM adopting the \\"Beautiful Music\\" format by 1978. During this time the station had a number of popular specialty programs. \\"A Starlight Concert\\" heard weeknights from 10 to 11pm features light classical music introduced by Francis Kirton who became the station's fine arts director. Kirton also hosted the Sunday morning programs \\"Variety Theatre\\" featuring condensations of popular operettas recorded by the Readers Digest Association, \\"Concert in the Park\\" featuring marches and brass band music, \\"Waltz Time\\", a half-hour of familiar music in 3/4 time and \\"At the Console\\" showcasing the world's great theatre organs. Other specialty programs included \\"Ray Wickens' Broadway\\" hosted by British theatre aficionado Ray Wickens and featuring full original cast recordings; and \\"The Golden Age of Comedy\\" hosted by Armand Romagnoli and Mark Lawrence presenting classic comedy routines and old-time radio comedies. For a time in the late 1970s the station also carried the syndicated version of \\"The CBS Radio Mystery Theatre\\". The station's most popular program was \\"Howard Cable Presents\\" hosted by Howard Cable who was, at the time, the music director for the Imperial Room at the Fairmont Royal York hotel in Toronto. The program showcased many of the performers appearing at the Imperial Room as well as popular songs from shows and movies, Big Band favorites and Classical music. On July 1, 1979, the callsign was changed to CHRE for station owner R.E. (Robert) Redmond. By 1985, Redmond determined that the \\"beautiful Music\\" audience was rapidly aging and opted to switch to a soft rock/adult contemporary format geared to a younger crowd. At this time, all of the specialty programs were dropped. The parent company became known as Redmond Communications in 1985 and was granted a license to open CJEZ-FM (now CHBM-FM) in Toronto. The station was subsequently sold to Affinity Radio Group in 1999. Affinity was acquired by Telemedia the following year, and Telemedia was itself bought out by Standard Broadcasting in 2002. In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CHRE. In September 2010, CHRE-FM underwent several changes including a change in direction, a new logo and new on-air staff. The station tweaked its adult contemporary format featuring current pop hits mixed with retro hits (80s & 90s), a change similarly done at sister station CKLH-FM. CHRE-FM partially reaches the city of Toronto, although its signal is sometimes blocked by CHRY-FM. In addition, sister station CIQM-FM moved to hot adult contemporary, but CHRE-FM and CKLH- FM did not change their actual formats due to existing hot adult contemporary stations in those areas. On July 5, 2013, Bell Media officially took ownership of Astral Media, and as a result, CHRE-FM became a part of Bell Media's radio station group. In January 2015, CHRE-FM's first home, the former CHSC studios at 36 Queenston Street in St. Catharines, was demolished; its land will be used for a four-storey apartment building.CHSC's fortunes face final crumble , St. Catharines Standard, January 14, 2015 References External links * 105.7 EZ Rock * * Hre Hre Hre Category:Radio stations established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Ontario ","title":"CHRE-FM"},{"id":"3600587","text":"Phillip Lopate (born 1943) is an American film critic, essayist, fiction writer, poet, and teacher.

They have composed music for over 50 soundtracks across five languages - Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and English. Amongst the most critically acclaimed Indian musicians, the trio have won numerous awards, including National Film Award (India), Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards. They are often referred to as the \\"Amar Akbar Anthony\\" of the Hindi film music industry. Members =Shankar Mahadevan= Shankar Mahadevan, the main vocalist of the trio, was born and brought up in Chembur, a suburb of Mumbai, in a Tamil Iyer family from Kerala. He learned Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music in his childhood and started playing the veena at the age of five. He studied under Shrinivas Khale, a popular Marathi music composer. After graduating in 1988 with a degree in Software Engineering from Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology in Navi Mumbai under the auspices of Mumbai University, he worked as a software engineer on Oracle Version Six. After working for a while for Leading Edge Systems, Shankar ventured into the field of music. He earned his first award as a playback singer in a Tamil movie, collaborating with A. R. Rahman and winning a National Film Award for his song in Kandukondain Kandukondain. A prominent star in Tamil cinema, he gained further recognition upon the release of his first music album, Breathless, in 1998. In 2019 he was felicitated with the Padma Shri Award for his contribution to Film Music. He has 2 sons, Siddharth and Shivam Mahadevan, both of whom are singers as well. =Ehsaan Noorani= Ehsaan Noorani is the guitarist of Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Having studied music with Bismarck Rodrigues from a young age. Prior to going abroad to study further music at GIT (Los Angeles), Ehsaan was an integral part of two local bands in Mumbai, Pegasus and Crosswinds. Ehsaan returned to Mumbai and was in demand for his musical skills in composing jingles, working for all the top composers of the time. Until the day Magic Box productions approached him to compose the jingle for Sona Spices, and that marked the beginning of Ehsaans independent journey as a composer of jingles in India. Ehsaan was approached by Mukul S. Anand to compose the music for his film Dus, and he in turn asked Shankar and Loy to join him in composing the music for the film. 'Dus' never made it to the big screen, due to the death of the director. Ehsaan is the only Indian musician to have endorsed a signature line 'The Ehsaan Noorani Fender Squire' signature series Fender guitars, one of the largest and most reputed guitar manufacturers in the world. =Loy Mendonsa= Loy Mendonsa is a multi- instrumentalist who plays the piano, bass guitar, harmonica and is currently learning to play the trumpet. Loy was a genius music teacher for a school in New Delhi, when he was invited to write the music for the show 'Quiz Time' by Siddharth Basu, who gave him his first break. Loy then went on to compose the title track for 'The World This week' and for the Shahrukh Khan TV serial 'Fauji'. Loy moved to Bombay, met Ehsaan in 1989 and together they composed several ad jingles. His daughter Alyssa Mendonsa is a playback singer who has lent her voice to their songs History =Formation (1985–1996)= Shankar- Ehsaan-Loy at Idea Rocks India, Bangalore (6 April 2012) Shankar Ehsaan and Loy came up from the ranks of the non-film music scene, performing rock, blues, jazz and pop before entering the film music industry. Shankar Mahadevan, a software engineer, worked on Oracle Version Six and studied Western, Hindustani and Carnatic classical music. He made his debut with the 1985 Marathi film Vahinichi Maya. A leading playback singer with Pukar, Sapnay and Biwi No.1 to his credit, he also composed \\"Breathless\\". Ehsaan Noorani studied music at the Musicians' Institute in Los Angeles and worked with the like of Ronnie Desai, Laxmikant–Pyarelal, Kalyanji-Anandji and Louis Banks. He composed Alien Desire, did several jingles and like Loy, was part of a blues- and-acid jazz band. Loy Mendonsa is trained in Western classical and also learnt the rudiments of Indian classical music. He performed with several group bands, plays (Godspell, West Side Story, Jesus Christ Superstar) and composed jingles and signature tunes (Fauji, The World This Week). Ehsaan was doing jingles and Loy was in Delhi before the union. Loy was writing for television then. The show Quiz Time was his first work and Siddharth Basu gave him his first break. Then he did Prannoy Roy's The World This Week. A few more shows came along and he also did theatre and Shahrukh Khan's Fauji. Loy had also worked as keyboardist with A. R. Rahman and Shankar had sung many famous tracks for him. In 1989, Ehsaan met Loy, who was working for Ranjit Barot, an ad film composer. From then on, they joined together and composed several ad jingles together. Later, Ehsaan and Loy met Shankar when he was roped in by Ranjit Barot to sing for the Pepsi ad directed by Mukul Anand. Since then, they started to compose for ads as a trio. =Early years (1997–2001)= Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy were to make their debut as composers in Mukul Anand's film Dus. Director Anand wanted Ehsaan to compose the music for the film, but he insisted that Shankar and Loy work with him and Anand agreed. The film remained incomplete after Anand's death, though the album was released later in 1999. After Dus, they had composed music for a couple of films like Rockford and Bhopal Express, but all of them went unnoticed. Their entry to mainstream cinema was with Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Mission Kashmir, which was a musical hit and earned the trio a place in the Bollywood film industry. They also earned IIFA nominations for the same. =Dil Chahta Hai and rise to fame (2001–04)= In 2001, they made their film debut in Tamil film industry, as Kamal Haasan signed them to compose for Aalavandhan. The music sold well due to the hype surrounding the movie, though the movie itself was a dud in the box-office. The turning point of their career as music directors though, was Dil Chahta Hai, which was the debut film of Farhan Akhtar as a director. Initially, A. R. Rahman was considered to do the music, but he backed out due to other assignments. Then the trio composed a title track for the film, which Farhan liked, and he signed them for the film. The film won wide critical acclaim and went on to attain cult status among audiences. This marked the beginning of the trio's friendship with Farhan Akhtar and long-term association with Excel Entertainments. Post Dil Chahta Hai, they composed music for several small budget films like Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai?, Nayee Padosan and Ek Aur Ek Gyarah, where all of them went unnoticed as all the movies were panned by the critics. They also had two big ventures, Honey Irani's Armaan and Rohan Sippy's Kuch Naa Kaho, which yet again, failed to impress both critics and audiences – though their work in Armaan was lauded by critics. =Kal Ho Naa Ho and First National Award (2004–06)= Following Dil Chahta Hai, their next big venture was Dharma Productions' Kal Ho Naa Ho, directed by Nikhil Advani. The album broke all the previous records as a best-selling album. The music won many awards including the National Film Award for Best Music Direction. The year 2005 saw them collaborate with Shaad Ali for Bunty Aur Babli, as his first choice, A.R. Rahman, was busy with other assignments. The soundtrack, despite the initial mixed reaction from various critics, became immensely popular among the public, and went on to win several awards including Filmfare and IIFA awards. The song \\"Kajra Re\\" featuring Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan became a rage among the listeners. Following the success of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, their next album of 2006 was Farhan Akhtar's Don: The Chase Begins Again starring Shahrukh Khan. They composed seven songs, including two versions of \\"Yeh Mera Dil\\" and \\"Khaike Paan Banaraswala\\", from the original Don. The track \\"Aaj Ki Raat\\" was included in the Academy Award-winning soundtrack Slumdog Millionaire. =Later career (2007–present)= 2007 was arguably the best year of their career. The year started off with Nikhil Advani's multistarrer Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love, which was lauded by critics and music lovers alike, and went on to rule the music charts. The music was praised by the movie critics too, despite the movie itself receiving mixed to negative responses. Same was the fate of their next release, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Despite the music getting positive reviews and becoming quite a sensation among listeners, the movie failed to make a mark. However, this pattern was broken by their next release, Akshay Kumar's Heyy Babyy, where both the movie and the music were commercial successes. In August, the album Johnny Gaddaar was released, which was co produced by the trio and Adlabs, first of its kind in the history of Bollywood. Both the music and movie received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. Their year ended on a good note, as their last album of the year, Aamir Khan's Taare Zameen Par, was well received by critics, and both movie and music got a cult status among the audience. Thus, a really good year for the trio came to an end, with most of the above albums making its way to the top 10 lists of all major websites. In 2008, their major release was Rock On!! – which was a cult favourite and rage among the audience, and went on to become a huge commercial success, despite the initial cold reaction from the critics. Luck By Chance was their last album of 2008, which garnered positive reviews from both Indian and international critics alike. In 2009 the scored music of Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan starrer London Dreams. Although the music received favourable reviews, the movie didn't fare well in the box office. They also composed the music of Ayan Mukherjee's debut film Wake Up Sid starring Ranbir Kapoor along with Amit Trivedi. The music, especially the title track, topped charts. Their first soundtrack of the 2010 was Shahrukh Khan starrer My Name Is Khan. The soundtrack blends western bar blues and techno sounds with Indian classical styles such as Sufi and Hindustani. The soundtrack was well received, and they won several awards including, Star Screen Award for Best Music Director, Big Star Award For Best Music, and IIFA Award for Best Background Score. This was followed by Farhan Akhtar's Karthik Calling Karthik which despite getting mixed reviews from critics, went on to rule the charts. The track \\"Uff Teri Adaa\\" marked the debut of Loy's daughter Alyssa Mendonsa and became immensely popular. The next major release of the year was Sajid Khan's Housefull, which received generally favourable reviews from reviewers and the track \\"Oh Girl\\" crooned by Alyssa and Tarun Sagar topped the charts. Ali Zafar's Tere Bin Laden then followed, of which the song \\"Ullu Da Pattha\\" became a rage. The phrase was hence used for the promotion of the movie. Final release of 2010, was Dharma's We Are Family starring Arjun Rampal, Kajol and Kareena Kapoor. The album received lukewarm response, and the movie didn't do well at the box office either. 2011 began with Nikhil Advani's Akshay Kumar starrer Patiala House, which was well received by all mainstream critics, though the movie didn't quite get such an enthralling reception. The following release, Excel Entertainment's Game, was met with poor reviews. the movie itself was met with extremely negative reception from the critics and turned out to be a disaster at the box office. They also scored music for Walt Disney's maiden Indian venture, Zokkomon. The music and the movie failed to generate any positive buzz. Their first international venture, the UK movie West is West, was released on 18 February 2011. The music was well received by almost all the reviewers, despite the movie itself receiving reviews ranging from mixed to positive. Their major release of the year, Zoya Akhtar's multistarrer Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, was met with universal critical acclaim and opened well in the charts. However, the year ended on a low note for them with Farhan Akhtar's much anticipated Don 2 receiving mixed response from the critics. The trio had three releases in 2012. The bigger of their biggest releases, Kamal Haasan's controversial film Vishwaroopam, went on to become a major financial success.\\"Kamal Haasan's ‘Vishwaroopam’ sets new record, earns Rs 200 crores!\\".

Retrieved on 10 January 2011. In 2004, they performed for a concert organised by The Indian Express held in celebration of the democracy of India, which was also attended by Aamir Khan, Farhan Akhtar and other celebrities. They organised a concert at IFFI titled Salaam Boss (Salute to the Boss) in 2006 paying tribute to the legendary music composer R.D. Burman. Later in 2008, they performed for the Live Earth India Concert to help light homes with solar energy along with several other celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi. They have also performed a worldwide tour in 2010, called Inspiration: Aman Ki Aasha tour, which began in New Jersey, United States. The tour was a major success, garnering overwhelming response from the audience. They performed at UK for the first time, in the Asia Rocks! concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in September 2011. In 2018 they embarked on a Tour of the US & Canada along with Farhan Akhtar Frequent collaborators Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy have composed for most of the films produced by Excel Entertainment, founded by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani. They have also associated frequently with Karan Johar's Dharma Productions. Other notable collaborations are with directors like Karan Johar, Shaad Ali, Zoya Akhtar and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. Most of the lyrics for the songs composed by the trio are penned by Gulzar and Javed Akhtar; however, they have also frequently associated with lyricists like Prasoon Joshi & Amitabh Bhattacharya. Musical style Each member of the trio brings his own talents and experiences to the group, combining the Carnatic and Hindustani vocal tradition (Shankar), Western rock (Ehsaan) and a deep understanding of fusion including a virtual mastery over the electronic synthesizer (Loy). They continue a tradition quite common in Bollywood music, that of partnerships between music composers contributing and pooling their individual strengths, often combining deep knowledge of Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic (South Indian) classical music with technical expertise as composers and orchestral arrangers. Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy probably represent the first trio of composers to entertain Bollywood audiences themselves with their chart-topping music. The eternal quest among Bollywood's music composers has been to create interest among younger audiences who tend to be inspired more by musical themes and influences from the West. Since a film's soundtrack is a very influential and critical component of commercial and critical success (required and achieved or sometimes squandered at the box office), this quest to \\"deliver a film\\" has always inspired composers to create tunes which combine the best of both traditional Indian music and popular Western or international influences. An overwhelming majority of Bollywood's most popular music has been composed based on classical Indian rāgas (in Sanskrit \\"raga\\" is literally \\"color\\" or \\"mood\\"). Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy have bridged that gap. Inspiration Academy Award-winning lyricist Gulzar described the music of the trio as a sensible synthesis of popularity and class. Composer duo Vishal- Shekhar considers them as an inspiration. Upcoming musicians Arko Mukherjee, Rajkumar Sengupta and Debopratim Bakshi of the Friends of Fusion band from Kolkata said \\"We have been influenced by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, so we mix our own elements to their composition. It's our way of paying homage to them\\" In Marathi film 'Satrangee Re' paid a tribute to Shankar Ehsan Loy by playing their song Kal Ho Naa Ho. Incidentally Shankar Mahadevan's nephew Saumil Shringarpure also acted in this. The trio is known for launching the career of numerous singers, including Mahalakshmi Iyer, Anusha Mani, Caralisa Monteiro, Dominique Cerejo, and Hard Kaur. Awards Shankar Ehsaan Loy were the recipients of several awards, including three Filmfare awards (Bunty Aur Babli, Kal Ho Naa Ho, 2 States), three International Indian Film Academy Awards (Kal Ho Naa Ho, Bunty Aur Babli, My Name is Khan), three Star Screen awards (Dil Chahta Hai, Bunty Aur Babli,My Name Is Khan),one Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent and two MTV Immies Awards.

It sits on the River Blackwater, in the townland of Lisbofin, at the border with County Tyrone. The villages of Benburb and Moy are nearby. Blackwatertown had a population of 376 in the 2011 Census. The River Blackwater enters Lough Neagh west of Derrywarragh Island and is navigable from Maghery to Blackwatertown. History In 1575, during the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the English built a fort at what is now Blackwatertown, to control this important river crossing in the heart of Gaelic Ulster. Most of the fort was on the eastern bank of the river, and there was a stone tower on the western bank. In February 1595, at the outset of the Nine Years' War, a Gaelic force led by Art MacBaron O'Neill assaulted and captured the fort from the English. This fort is referenced in the village's Irish name, An Port Mór (\\"the great fort\\").Place Names NI The wider townland is also called Lisbofin, from Lios Bó Finne meaning \\"fort of the white cow\\", which may refer to one of the ringforts in the area. Blackwatertown was one of the first places in Northern Ireland to erect street signs in the Irish language in 1980. The village recently had signs erected at the entrances indicating its name; previously signs were erected by local individuals indicating its name in the Irish language.  Education  Blackwatertown had three schools: Blackwatertown Boys' Primary School and Blackwatertown Girls' Primary School, both of which were managed by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools; and Blackwatertown Primary School, managed by Blackwatertown Methodist Church and attended by pupils of several denominations. As the non-Roman Catholic population dwindled Blackwatertown Primary School ceased to be viable and closed. The other two schools amalgamated and formed a new school known as St Jarlath's Primary School. Sport The Blackwatertown and Benburb Ancient Order of Hibernians Pipe Band, circa 1930 The local GAA club, Port Mór, plays at Junior level in county competitions.Armagh GAA website The local Boxing Club is St Jarlaths ABC. The ancient sport of Road Bowling, known as Bullets, is still played along country roads.

Their work is available to the public from the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Art Centre and Museum and also from the YBE art centre. Pioneer bark painters from this region the National Museum of Australia consider old masters include Mithinarri Gurruwiwi, Birrikitji Gumana and Mawalan Marika. It is also a traditional home of the Yidaki (didgeridoo), and some of the world's finest didgeridoos are still made at Yirrkala. =Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre= The Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre, formerly Buku-Larrŋgay Arts and also known as the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Art Centre and Museum, is a world-renowned centre, with well-known artists such as Nyapanyapa Yunupingu based there. The inspiration for the gallery arose in the 1960s, when Narritjin Maymuru set up his own gallery on the beachfront. In 1976 Buku- Larrŋgay Arts was established by local artists in the old Mission health centre, after missionaries had left and as the Aboriginal land rights and Homeland movements gathered pace. A new museum was built in 1988 using a Bicentenary grant, and this now contains a collection created in the 1970s which illustrates clan law. It also houses the message sticks which, after delivery by the anthropologist Donald Thomson were instrumental in establishing peaceful talks during the Caledon Bay crisis in 1935. In 1996, extra gallery spaces and a screen print studio were built, and in 2007, The Mulka Project was added. This project comprises a collection of many thousands of historical images and films, and continues to create new digital art and images. The current centre, greatly expanded, comprises two divisions: the Yirrkala Art Centre, which represents the artists exhibiting and selling contemporary art, and The Mulka Project, which incorporates the museum. Land rights Yirrkala played a pivotal role in the development of the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians when the document Bark Petition was created at Yirrkala in 1963 and sent to the Federal Government to protest at the Prime Minister's announcement that a parcel of their land was to be sold to a bauxite mining company. Although the petition itself was unsuccessful in the sense that the bauxite mining at Nhulunbuy went ahead as planned, it alerted non-Indigenous Australians to the need for Indigenous representation in such decisions, and prompted a government report recommending payment of compensation, protection of sacred sites, creation of a permanent parliamentary standing committee to scrutinise developments at Yirrkala, and also acknowledged the Indigenous people's moral right to their lands.

Chief Peminacka of the Minqua tribe had deeded the large tract of land along Naaman's Creek to John Risingh on behalf of the Swedish colony. The structure was originally designed for defense.

The Tampa 2 is typically employed out of a 4–3 defensive alignment, which consists of four linemen, three linebackers, two cornerbacks, and two safeties. The defense is similar to a Cover 2 defense, except the middle linebacker drops into a deep middle coverage for a Cover 3 when he reads a pass play. The term rose to popularity due to the installation and effective execution of this defensive scheme by then-head coach Tony Dungy and defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, and the style helped the Buccaneers win Super Bowl XXXVII. 4–3 defense in a Tampa \\"Under\\" front, with back 7 falling into Tampa 2 zone coverage. Cornerbacks jam receivers before falling back into their zones. Middle linebacker ensures the deep middle is covered. The roots of the Tampa 2 system actually come from the Pittsburgh Steelers and their Steel Curtain defense of the 1970s.Jaworski, Ron, Cosell, Greg, and Plaut, David The Games that Changed the Game, Ballantine, 2010, Chapter 2. \\"My philosophy is really out of the 1975 Pittsburgh Steelers playbook,\\" said Dungy (who played for the Steelers early in his career) during media interviews while at Super Bowl XLI. \\"That is why I have to laugh when I hear 'Tampa 2'. Chuck Noll and Bud Carson—that is where it came from, I changed very little.\\"Official site of the Pittsburgh Steelers - Article Lovie Smith mentions having played the system in junior high school during the 1970s, though Carson introduced the idea of moving the middle linebacker into coverage. Carson's system became especially effective with the Steelers' addition of aggressive and athletic middle linebacker Jack Lambert.Layden, Tim. \\"Two Tough\\" . 27 Nov 2006. Sports Illustrated. retrieved July 1, 2013. After Dungy became head coach of the Indianapolis Colts and Lovie Smith (linebackers coach in Tampa from 1996–2000) became head coach of the Chicago Bears, they installed the Tampa 2 in their respective teams. During the 2005 NFL season, the Buccaneers, still under defensive coordinator Kiffin, ranked first in the league in fewest total yards allowed, Smith's Bears ranked number two, and Dungy's Colts ranked eleventh. By 2006, the Buffalo Bills, Minnesota Vikings, Kansas City Chiefs, and Detroit Lions had also adopted the defense. In college football, Gene Chizik is among the coaches that successfully implemented the Tampa 2. The scheme is known for its simple format, speed, and the aggressive mentality of its players. Tampa 2 teams are known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed, and practice to always run to the ball. It also requires a hard hitting secondary to cause turnovers. Tampa 2 description The personnel used in the Tampa 2 are specific in position and required abilities. All positions in this defense place a premium on speed, and often the result is that they are all undersized by league standards. The defensive linemen in this scheme have to be quick and agile enough to create pressure on the quarterback without the aid of a blitz from either the linebackers or the secondary, with the defensive tackle in the nose position having above-average tackling skills to help stop runs. Warren Sapp is often cited as the primary example of a defensive lineman who flourished in this scheme; indeed, he is now reckoned as the prototype three-technique defensive tackle. The three linebackers, two cornerbacks and two safeties are responsible for covering the middle of the field. The outside linebackers' general zone is between the cornerbacks, covering the area of the field from the line of scrimmage to 10 yards back. The middle linebacker must have better-than-average speed, and additional skills to be able to read the play and either maintain his central position to help the outside linebackers cover short passes, drop behind the linebackers in coverage and protect the zone of the field behind the outside linebackers from 11–20 yards out, or run up to the line of scrimmage to help assist in stopping the runs. \\"It takes a special linebacker to do that, a guy with speed,\\" wrote Pete Prisco, senior NFL writer for CBSSports.com. The cornerbacks protect the sidelines of the field from the line of scrimmage to anywhere between 15–20 yards out. According to Prisco, they \\"don't have to be great man-to-man cover players, but they have to be guys who can tackle.\\" Dungy always expected his linebackers and cornerbacks to be above-average tacklers, as they are usually the primary tacklers in the defense. The two safeties are responsible for covering their respective halves of the field from 20 yards out and more. The safeties in the system are expected to be above-average cover men with the ability to break up passes, but each safety also is expected to have additional specific skills. The strong safeties, while not expected to be great tacklers, are expected to be hard hitters. The hard hitting strong safety protects the middle of the field from being exploited by small, fast receivers, and running backs on wheel route. The free safety will be called upon to do one of two things in certain situations: either blitz the quarterback, requiring him to have the skills necessary to beat a blocking halfback or fullback, or to assume the coverage zone left by a blitzing cornerback. The Tampa 2 is particularly effective against teams who are playing from behind, because it limits big plays. It forces offenses to be patient and to settle for short gains and time-consuming drives. This may be due to the nature of the \\"bend-but-don't-break\\" 2-deep zone coverage scheme and responsibilities safeties play in the Tampa 2. When executed properly, the Tampa 2 defense is difficult to beat, a reason for its longevity, having seen no fundamental changes since first introduced in 1996. Teams that have been successful against this defense have managed to run the ball up the middle past the defensive tackles, or throw passes in the seams between the outside linebackers and the cornerbacks (often the most effective receiver against a Tampa 2 defense is a tight end, since they often line up against this seam). Other tactics that have shown to be effective on occasion are misdirection plays that take advantage of the defensive speed and rely on the defense 'over-running' the play (such as the middle linebacker rushing to the line of scrimmage on a play-action pass), or overloading the safeties by having multiple receivers running deep routes, creating more targets in a zone than defenders. Recently, some teams have also been able to exploit the seam between the cornerbacks and the safeties, when the quarterback can throw a pass to a receiver in that seam faster than the safety can rush up to close it and cover the receiver. A recent trend is for teams to send a receiver up the middle, creating a mismatch against the linebacker in coverage. The popularity of the Tampa 2 means that offenses are now finding it effective to exploit the deep middle, where the safeties have to cover the most ground.Bryant, Howard. Williams: Offenses Have Uncovered the Cover 2. 22 Dec 2006. The Washington Post. retrieved June 24, 2013. Run defense To defend running plays, the Tampa 2 is a single gap defense where each player is responsible for covering his own gap. The assigned gap changes with game conditions and personnel. Typically this style of defense utilizes smaller but faster linemen and linebackers with above average speed. Also, the defensive backs must be above average hitters. The key theme in stopping the run is directing traffic to the weak-side linebacker. It is therefore necessary to have a skilled tackler at the WLB position (e.g., Derrick Brooks, Lance Briggs, Sean Lee).

The university also has satellite campuses across the department in the cities of Barrancabermeja, Barbosa, Málaga, Piedecuesta, Socorro. UIS is the largest higher education institution and is regarded as one of the leading multidisciplinary research universities in Colombia by student population, research groups, academic output, technological development, and number of publications. UIS is one of the most selective Colombian universities and have been ranked as the top university in the North region of Colombia. The university was created by ordinance No. 83 of June 22, 1944, by the Departmental Assembly, and began its labors in March 1948. The university offers many degrees at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, with 124 academic programs, which includes 21 master, 9 medical residency programs, and 6 doctorates. History The University was created by the municipal ordinance No. 83 of 22 June 1944, during the industrial boom that took place in Colombia after the II world war. After the accomplishment of several legislative and administrative developments, the University officially began its educational function the 1st of March, 1948 with 20 students. Initially only engineering degrees of Electronics, Mechanical and Chemical were offered. Later during the 1950s and 1960s were added the petroleum and metallurgical engineering as well as the school of health sciences with programs in medicine, nursing, bacteriology, nutrition, physical therapy and social work. It is the latter, which influenced the change from the European Educational Administrative Model to the American Model, causing student protests and social discomfort due to the ideas brought by the Cuban Revolution Spirit in 1959 and the criticism of the bipartisan pact of the National Front. By the 1970s, the University expanded its educative offerings to the engineering degree of systems, languages teaching, biology and Mathematics. Finally, after nearly two decades, in September 1994, the faculty of law and political science were added to become the first law program offered by a public educational institution in the north-eastern region of Colombia. http://www.uis.edu.co/webUIS/es/acercaUis/02-19%20WEB_HistoriaUIS.pdf Organization Its main campus, known also as Campus Universitario Principal (Main University Campus, CUP), is located in the northeast part of the city and hosts the faculties of Sciences, Engineering, and Humanities.

The battleship was laid down in November 1911 and launched on 21 February 1914. She was formally commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 8 November 1914, just over 4 months after the start of World War I. The name Kronprinz (Eng: \\"Crown Prince\\") refers to Crown Prince Wilhelm, and in June 1918, the ship was renamed Kronprinz Wilhelm in his honor. The battleship was armed with ten guns in five twin turrets and could steam at a top speed of . Along with her three sister ships, , and , Kronprinz took part in most of the fleet actions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Although near the front of the German line, she emerged from the battle unscathed. She was torpedoed by the British submarine on 5 November 1916 during an operation off the Danish coast. Following repairs, she participated in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault in the Baltic, in October 1917. During the operation Kronprinz engaged the and forced her to retreat. After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still on the bottom of the harbor.  Design  alt=Schematics for this type of battleship; the ships mount five gun turrets, two forward, one in the center between two smoke stacks, and two aft The four s were ordered as part of the Anglo-German naval arms race; they were the fourth generation of German dreadnought battleships, and they were built in response to the British that had been ordered in 1909. The Königs represented a development of the earlier , with the primary improvement being a more efficient arrangement of the main battery. The ships had also been intended to use a diesel engine on the center propeller shaft to increase their cruising range, but development of the diesels proved to be more complicated than expected, so an all-steam turbine powerplant was retained. Kronprinz displaced as built and fully loaded, with a length of , a beam of and a draft of . She was powered by three Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by three oil-fired and twelve coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft water- tube boilers, which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. She was armed with ten SK L/50 guns arranged in five twin gun turrets: two superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 quick-firing guns and six SK L/45 quick-firing guns, all mounted singly in casemates. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was also armed with five underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. The ship's armored belt consisted of Krupp cemented steel that was thick in the central portion that protected the propulsion machinery spaces and the ammunition magazines, and was reduced to forward and aft. In the central portion of the ship, horizontal protection consisted of a deck, which was reduced to on the bow and stern. The main battery turrets had of armor plate on the sides and on the roofs, while the casemate guns had of armor protection. The sides of the forward conning tower were also 30 cm thick.  Service history  Illustration of Kronprinz Kronprinz was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Brandenburg and built at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel under construction number 182. Her keel was laid in May 1912 and she was launched on 21 February 1914. The ship's namesake, Crown Prince Wilhelm, was to have given the launching speech, but he was sick at the time so Prince Heinrich, the General Inspector of the Navy, gave it in his place. Crown Princess Cecile christened the ship. The ship was scheduled to be completed in early 1915, but work was expedited after the outbreak of World War I in mid-1914. Fitting-out work was completed by 8 November 1914, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet. Kronprinz was completed in November 1914; following her commissioning she joined III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. Gottfried von Dalwigk zu Lichtenfels served as the ship's first commander. Kronprinz completed her sea trials on 2 January 1915. The first operation in which she participated was an uneventful sortie by the fleet into the North Sea on 29–30 March. Three weeks later, on 17–18 April, she and her sisters supported an operation in which the light cruisers of II Scouting Group laid mines off the Swarte Bank. Another sweep by the fleet occurred on 22 April; two days later III Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of exercises. On 8 May an explosion occurred in the center turret's right gun. The Baltic exercises lasted until 13 May, at which point III Squadron returned to the North Sea. Another minelaying operation was conducted by II Scouting Group on 17 May, with the battleship again in support. Kronprinz participated in a fleet operation into the North Sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 May 1915. In August, Constanz Feldt replaced Dalwigk zu Lichtenfels as the ship's captain. The ship supported a minelaying operation on 11–12 September off Texel. The fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea on 23–24 October. Several uneventful sorties followed on 5–7 March 1916, 31 March and 2–3 April. Kronprinz supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force of I Scouting Group. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 CET, and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters. = Battle of Jutland = alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Kronprinz was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. Kronprinz was the rearmost ship of V Division, III Battle Squadron, the vanguard of the fleet. She followed her sisters König, the lead ship, Grosser Kurfürst, and Markgraf. III Battle Squadron was the first of three battleship units; directly astern were the Kaiser-class battleships of VI Division, III Battle Squadron. Directly astern of the Kaiser-class ships were the and es of II Battle Squadron; in the rear guard were the obsolescent pre- dreadnoughts of I Battle Squadron. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, Königs crew spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. Kronprinzs sisters opened fire on the British battlecruisers, but Kronprinz was not close enough to engage them. Instead, she and ten other German battleships fired at the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. Kronprinz fired at from 17:51 to 18:00 at ranges of , then shifted her fire to the fast battleship at 18:08 at a range of 17,000 m. Kronprinz fired first with semi-armor-piercing shells to find the range to her target, then with standard armor-piercing shells. By the time Malaya drew out of range 13 minutes later, only one hit had been reported by Kronprinzs gunners. According to naval historian John Campbell, this hit was more likely \\"the flash of the Malayas guns seen through haze and smoke\\". During this period, several salvos fell close to Kronprinz, though none struck her. Kronprinz again reached a firing position against Malaya at 18:30, but was only able to fire for six minutes before the British ship again pulled away. A König-class battleship firing her main guns at Jutland, by Claus Bergen Shortly after 19:00, several British destroyers attempted a torpedo attack against the leading ships of the German line. The destroyer fired a pair of torpedoes at Kronprinz at a range of , though both missed. The German cruiser had been disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser , and Rear Admiral Paul Behncke in König ordered his four ships to maneuver to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British III and IV Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. Kronprinz and her sisters fired heavily on the British cruisers, but failed to drive them off. In the ensuing melee, the British armored cruiser was struck by several heavy caliber shells from the German dreadnoughts. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser. John Campbell notes that although Defences destruction is usually attributed to the battlecruiser , there is a possibility that it was Kronprinzs fire that destroyed the ship. After the destruction of Defence, Kronprinz shifted her fire to ; the British cruiser was badly damaged and forced to withdraw from the battle. She was unable to reach port, and was abandoned the following morning. By 20:00, the German line was ordered to turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. Markgraf, directly ahead of Kronprinz, had engine problems and fell out of formation, then fell in behind Kronprinz. Between 20:00 and 20:30, Kronprinz and the other III Squadron battleships engaged the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron as well as the battleships of the Grand Fleet. Kronprinz attempted to find the range by observing the British muzzle flashes, but the worsening visibility prevented her gunners from acquiring a target. As a result, she held her fire in this period. Kronprinz was violently shaken by several near misses. At 20:18, Scheer ordered the fleet to turn away a third time to escape from the murderous British gunfire; this turn reversed the order of the fleet and placed Kronprinz toward the end of the line. After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard and , the lead ship, caused delays. The fleet fell into formation by 23:30, with Kronprinz the 14th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships. Painting of a König-class ship under fire at Jutland by Claus Bergen Around 02:45, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line; Kronprinz spotted several unidentified destroyers in the darkness. Kronprinz held her fire, and she and the other battleships turned away to avoid torpedoes. One torpedo, fired by the destroyer , exploded about behind Kronprinz, in the battleship's wake. Both Obedient and reported a hit on Kronprinz, though she was undamaged by the near miss. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. The High Seas Fleet had managed to punch through the British light forces and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June, and Wilhelmshaven a few hours later. The I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead, while Kronprinz, , , and stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. In the course of the battle, Kronprinz had fired 144 armor- piercing and semi-armor-piercing rounds from her main battery guns, though the exact numbers of each are unknown. The ship did not fire her secondary 15 cm or 8.8 cm guns during the entire engagement. Of the four König-class ships, only Kronprinz escaped damage during the battle. = Subsequent operations = On 18 August 1916, Kronprinz took part in an operation to bombard Sunderland. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan; the two serviceable German battlecruisers— and —supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Kronprinz, would trail behind and provide cover. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just eleven weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Kronprinz participated in two uneventful fleet operations, one a month prior on 16 July to the north of Helgoland, and one into the North Sea on 18–20 October. Kronprinz and the rest of III Squadron were sent to the Baltic directly afterward for training, which lasted until 2 November. Upon returning from the Baltic, Kronprinz and the rest of III Squadron were ordered to cover the retrieval of a pair of U-boats that were stranded on the Danish coast. On the return trip, on 5 November 1916, Kronprinz was torpedoed by the British submarine near Horns Reef. The torpedo struck the ship beneath the forward- most gun turret and allowed approximately of water into the ship. Kronprinz maintained her speed and reached port. The following day she was placed in drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for repairs, which lasted from 6 November to 4 December. During this period, Bernhard Rösing took command of the vessel. After returning to III Squadron, Kronprinz took part in squadron training in the Baltic before conducting defensive patrols in the German Bight. In early 1917, the ship became the flagship of the deputy commander of the squadron, at that time Rear Admiral Karl Seiferling. During training maneuvers on 5 March 1917, Kronprinz was accidentally rammed by her sister ship in the Heligoland Bight. The collision caused minor flooding in the area abreast of her forward superfiring turret; Kronprinz shipped some of water. She again went into the drydock in Wilhelmshaven, from 6 March to 14 May. On 11 September, Kronprinz was detached for training in the Baltic. She then joined the Special Unit for Operation Albion. = Operation Albion = In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of Ösel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. V Division included the four König-class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship Bayern. VI Division consisted of the five Kaiser-class battleships. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on Ösel numbered some 14,000 men. alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships The operation began on 12 October; at 03:00 König anchored off Ösel in Tagga Bay and disembarked soldiers. By 05:50, König opened fire on Russian coastal artillery emplacements, joined by Moltke, Bayern, and the other three König- class ships. Simultaneously, the Kaiser-class ships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and Dagö islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the Gulf. Both Grosser Kurfürst and Bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions, with minimal damage to the former. Bayern was severely damaged, and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. After the bombardment, Kronprinz departed the area for Putziger Wiek, where she refueled. The ship passed through Irben Strait on 16 October. On 16 October, it was decided to detach a portion of the invasion flotilla to clear the Russian naval forces in Moon Sound; these included the two Russian pre- dreadnoughts. To this end, Kronprinz and König, along with the cruisers and and a number of smaller vessels, were sent to engage the Russian battleships, leading to the Battle of Moon Sound. They arrived by the morning of 17 October, but a deep Russian minefield thwarted their progress. The Germans were surprised to discover that the 30.5 cm guns of the Russian battleships out-ranged their own 30.5 cm guns. The Russian ships managed to keep the range long enough to prevent the German battleships from being able to return fire, while still firing effectively on the German ships, and the Germans had to take several evasive maneuvers to avoid the Russian shells. By 10:00, the minesweepers had cleared a path through the minefield, and Kronprinz and König dashed into the bay. At around 10:15, Kronprinz opened fire on Tsarevitch and Bayan, and scored hits on both. König, meanwhile, dispatched Slava. The Russian vessels were hit dozens of times, until at 10:30 the Russian naval commander, Admiral Bakhirev, ordered their withdrawal. On 18 October, Kronprinz was slightly grounded, though the damage was not serious enough to necessitate withdrawal for repairs. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the 26th, Kronprinz was more seriously grounded on the return trip to Kiel. She managed to reach Kiel on 2 November, and subsequently Wilhelmshaven. Repairs were effected from 24 November to 8 January 1918. = Advance of 23 April 1918 = On 27 January, the Kaiser directed that the ship be renamed Kronprinz Wilhelm in honor of the Crown Prince. The ship was formally renamed on 15 June 1918, the 30th anniversary of the Kaiser's reign. By this time, German light forces had begun raiding coal convoys between Britain and Norway, prompting the Grand Fleet to detach battleships to escort the shipments. The Germans were now presented with an opportunity for which they had been waiting the entire war: a portion of the numerically stronger Grand Fleet was separated and could be isolated and destroyed. Admiral Franz von Hipper, now the fleet commander, planned the operation: I Scouting Group with its accompanying light cruisers and destroyers would attack one of the large convoys while the rest of the High Seas Fleet would stand by, ready to attack the British battle squadron. At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the German fleet, including Kronprinz, departed from the Schillig roadstead. Hipper ordered wireless transmissions be kept to a minimum, to prevent radio intercepts by British intelligence. At 06:10 the German battlecruisers had reached a position approximately southwest of Bergen when Moltke lost her inner starboard propeller, which severely damaged the ship's engines. The crew effected temporary repairs that allowed the ship to steam at , but it was decided to take the ship under tow. Despite this setback, Hipper continued northward. By 14:00, Hipper's force had crossed the convoy route several times but had found nothing. At 14:10, Hipper turned his ships southward. By 18:37, the German fleet had made it back to the defensive minefields surrounding their bases. It was later discovered that the convoy had left port a day later than expected by the German planning staff. Kronprinz saw no further major activity for the remainder of the war. During this period, Rear Admiral Ernst Goette and now-Rear Admiral Feldt flew their flags ship the ship during their tenures as squadron deputy commander. The vessel went to the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel in mid-September for periodic maintenance. = Fate = Kronprinz Wilhelm and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the Grand Admiral (Großadmiral) of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. Many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships, including Kronprinz Wilhelm, mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Scuttled German fleet at Scapa Flowalt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kronprinz Wilhelm sank at 13:15; The British guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships; British soldiers aboard a nearby drifter shot and killed a stoker from Kronprinz Wilhelm. In total, the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty-one. The remaining crews, totaling some 1,860 officers and enlisted men, were imprisoned. Kronprinz Wilhelm was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled. Kronprinz Wilhelm and two of her sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962. The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, Kronprinz Wilhelm and her sisters are one of the few remaining sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices. Kronprinz Wilhelm and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Centre for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Kronprinz Wilhelm and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating. The wreck at some point came into the ownership of the firm Scapa Flow Salvage, which sold the rights to the vessel to Tommy Clark, a diving contractor, in 1981. Clark listed the wreck for sale on eBay with a \\"buy-it-now\\" price of £250,000, with the auction lasting until 28 June 2019. Three other wrecks—those of Markgraf, König, and the light cruiser —all also owned by Clark, were also placed for sale. The wrecks of Kronprinz Wilhelm and her two sisters ultimately sold for £25,500 apiece to a company from the Middle East, while Karlsruhe sold to a private buyer for £8,500.

The black-and-white film stars Barbara Stanwyck and Barry Sullivan as a married couple, and Ralph Meeker as an escaped convict. The film was based on a 22-minute radio play, \\"A Question of Time\\".. Award-winning cinematographer Victor Milner, in addition to photographing the film, also has a bit part in the movie. A portion of the film was shot in Pioneertown, and features footage of the \\"cantina\\" building that now houses Pappy & Harriet's. Plot Americans Doug and Helen Stilwin and their young son, Bobby, embark on a vacation driving across the border into desolate Baja California in Mexico to a remote fishing spot along the coast that her father used to frequent with his old military buddies. Upon arrival at the remote beach, young Bobby goes exploring out onto a precarious, rotting jetty high above the water. His foot gets stuck in a crack between boards. After Doug frees him, they start back, but part of the jetty collapses, and a wooden piling falls on Doug's leg, trapping him on the beach just as the tide starts coming in. Helen tries to lift the piling with their car jack, but it breaks. Doug sends her for a rope or help at a deserted gas station they stopped at earlier. He estimates they have four hours before he drowns in the rising surf. Helen speeds away in the family car. She comes across some Mexicans, but the language barrier proves insurmountable. Helen reaches the gas station and finds rope. A man, Lawson, appears; Helen explains her predicament, and he gets in the car. Hidden out of her sight, however, is a dead man. It soon becomes clear that Lawson has no interest in helping her husband; he is a dangerous escaped convict. He finds Doug's pistol in the glove compartment. When they spot a police car approaching, Lawson makes her drive and pretends to be asleep. He threatens to kill her if she betrays him. Meanwhile, a fishing boat passes by the beach, but too far away for Doug and Bobby's shouts for help to be understood; a crewman thinks they are just friendly tourists, and the boat sails away. Helen alone with Lawson Lawson runs through a police roadblock, and eventually blows out a tire. As he changes the tire, Helen tries to hit him, but he is too alert. Another police car pursues them, but Lawson drives it off the road, flipping it. Lawson hides out in an abandoned house to wait for the police to pass. While waiting there, Helen tells him she will do \\"anything\\" to save her husband. Lawson kisses her several times. Helen points out that he will need to change his clothes; his shirt has a prisoner number on the back, and he left his jacket behind while fleeing the police. She says he is about the same size as her husband; plus, he could also take Doug's identification, and she would go along to corroborate his disguise. Lawson is convinced and drives to the beach. He ties the rope to the fallen piling and the car bumper, and tries to pull it loose, without success. He then decides to leave, but Helen refuses to give up; so, Lawson comes up with another idea. He uses a plank to wedge the piling off Doug, saving his life. Helen offers to hold up her end of the bargain and leave with Lawson, but he decides to go on alone. Then he sees the car has another flat tire, and a police siren is heard. Helen shakes hands with Lawson, before he flees on foot down the coast. When the police drive up, Helen does not tell them about Lawson.

The resort features a large game reserve, as well as claims to be the largest wooden structure in the world. The wooden hotel structure was developed by Victor Nymark. Opened in 1930, the rustic-styled hotel contains 211 guest rooms and suites. Initially owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway company, the building is considered one of Canada's grand railway hotels. After its completion, the property was leased to the private Seigniory Club until 1970, when Canadian Pacific Railway converted the property into a public resort. The resort property is presently owned by the Evergrande Group, and is managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Location rue Notre Dame. The Château Montebello is located at 392 rue Notre Dame, in the western section of Montebello, Quebec, a municipality in the Outaouais region of the province. The road forms a part of Quebec Route 148, a provincial highway that connects Ottawa to Montreal. The roadway bisects the property, dividing it into two sections. The property south of rue Notre Dame contains the main buildings of the resort, whereas the section north of the road contains the resort's golf course, and hiking trails. The hotel property is bounded by a roadway, natural waterway, and forests. To the south, the resort is bounded by the Ottawa River, which serves as the border between Ontario and Quebec. To the west, the property is bounded by Quebec Route 323, a provincial highway that connects Montebello to Mont Tremblant. The community of Montebello is situated to the west of Quebec Route 323. In addition to facilities located on property, the resort is situated near several attractions. North of the resort lies Parc Omega, a safari park featuring local wildlife. Situated west of the resort is Plaisance National Park, a provincial park managed by the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec. Resort grounds The Château Montebello is a year-round resort situated within old-growth forests, and past outcroppings of the Canadian shield. The resort is on one of the last surviving land grants made by 17th-century French monarchy to early settlers of New France. The resort grounds includes a number of facilities supporting the activities offered by the resort. This includes a 114-slip marina, and the marina clubhouse, in the southwestern section of the resort. Open from mid-May to mid-October, the marina is able to accommodate ships up to . Guests that dock at the marina are provided access to the resort amenities. The resort grounds includes a number of shared use paths for hiking, cross-country skiing, and dogsledding. The resort grounds also contains of hiking trails, and of cross-country skiing trails. In the section of the resort north of rue Notre Dame is an 18-hole, par 70 golf course. Designed by golf course architect Stanley Thompson, the course also contains the Golf Club Terrace, and a bar at its 18th hole. Other outdoor facilities at the resort include two skating rinks for ice hockey and skating, a snow tubing hill, a curling rink, and two tennis courts. The resort also operates rental and support facilities for dogsledding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, biking, fishing, horseback riding, and kayaking. The resort also contains a game reserve, known as the Fairmont Kenauk at Le Château Montebello. Containing more than 70 lakes within its boundaries, the preserve is home to a fish hatchery, and contains over 200 species of birds, and 50 other animal species. The resort employs biologists and naturalists in an effort to preserve the resources in the area. The resort operates 13 self-sufficient chalets and cabins within the game preserve. The cabins and chalets contain one to five bedrooms. West of the resort's main buildings, is Manoir Papineau, a National Historic Site of Canada. The turreted house functions as a historical museum. It is the only structure in the Chateau area which doesn't conform to the log cabin motif of the resort. =Hotel building= Architecture The central lobby of the hotel building features a large central fireplace surrounded by a mezzanine. The resort's hotel building is a large wooden structure, and claims to be the largest log building in the world. Construction for the hotel building was overseen by Finnish immigrant Victor Nymark, a master log builder who immigrated to Canada in 1924 after successfully completing a three-year course at Vaasa Industrial School. As work on the building began before the hotel's final design plans were completed, Nymark's construction crew occasionally proceeded without blueprints to guide them. The three resort buildings erected in 1930 were built using 10,000 western red cedar logs shipped from British Columbia. The log walls are painted black on the outside, although its interiors maintained the natural wood colouring. The building also featured 500,000 hand-slit cedar roof shakes and of wooden moulding. The completed structure saw a large log-building housing 211 guest rooms, and suites, with four wings extending outward from the central lobby in a star formation. Log rafters hanging above the lobby span nearly . The rotunda-shaped lobby serves as the centre of the hotel, featuring a three-storey atrium, built around a massive stone fireplace. The fireplace's chimney rises above the ground, and is surrounded by a mezzanine, and a third-floor balcony. Hotel facilities In addition to lodgings, the hotel operates a number of restaurants, and other food-based services within its buildings. The hotel's main dining room is Aux Chantignoles. Other dining facilities at the hotel include Le Riverain and The Seigneurie Bar. The hotel also has 17 event rooms, comprising a total of of space for conferences, and other social events. The hotel also operates several recreational facilities, such as a fitness centre. The hotel's indoor swimming pool is housed in a separate log cabin accessible from the hotel by tunnel. The indoor pool area features painted totem poles supporting the roof. The hotel is also equipped with two whirlpool baths, two saunas, and a fitness centre. The hotel also features a spa, with eight treatment rooms, and a couples suite. History François de Laval, the first Bishop of Quebec, purchased the property in 1674 from the French East India Company. The Quebec Seminary inherited it from Laval. In 1801, the land was sold to the family of Joseph Papineau. His son, Louis-Joseph Papineau, built a turreted stone mansion, the Manoir Papineau. In the late 1920s, Harold M. Saddlemire, a Swiss-American entrepreneur, acquired a site along the Ottawa River, on land that formerly formed part of the seigneurial system of New France. Saddlemire envisioned a private wilderness retreat for business and political leaders. He initially called this project \\"Lucerne-in-Quebec;\\" subsequently came to be known as the Seigniory Club. Despite the 1929 Wall Street Crash of 1929, work on the planned wilderness retreat began, as planned, in early 1930. View of the resort property in July 1930, in the month of its opening. The economic uncertainty did not delay the project, unlike many others, perhaps because the presidents of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), the National Bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada respectively, not to mention the Premier of Quebec, were all club directors. A special spur from the nearby CPR line had to be built to allow for the transport of red cedar logs and other supplies to the site. The Scandinavian log construction project was supervised by Finnish master- builder, Victor Nymark and construction manager Harold Landry Furst. Construction and woodworking teams worked in overlapping shifts around the clock using electric lighting at night. The church did not approve of working on the Sabbath; but by coincidence, the local curé was dispatched on an all- expenses paid trip to Rome for two months while the work proceeded apace.Mounsey, Josie. \\"A Winter's Tale: 'We were transported to a Christmas past'\\", The Independent (London). November 16, 2002. An army of 3500 laborers ensured that the project could reach completion in only four months. The club's grand opening was held on 1 July 1930. Three days after opening, a magnificent costume ball was held, attended by the Governor General of Canada and other such luminaries. The exclusive private retreat of the Seigniory Club took its name from the French land grant system. \\"Seigniory\\" is the anglicized version of the French seigneurie. The club was only open to an elite membership for its first 40 years of operation. Prominent Canadian club members during this period included Lester B. Pearson, the Prime Minister of Canada.

The resort remained a private retreat, owned by the CPR, and leased to the exclusive Seigniory Club until 1970, when it was converted into a public resort by Canadian Pacific Hotels, the hotel division of CPR. During this time the resort was renamed the Château Montebello. In 1981, the Château Montebello hosted the 7th G7 summit; and leaders such as Pierre Trudeau, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and François Mitterrand were guests along with the aides and security staffs traveling with these national leaders.Japan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA): Summit Meetings in the Past. In August 1983, the Bilderberg Group held its annual meeting at the resort. In October 1983, the resort hosted the ministerial meeting for NATO's Nuclear Planning Group.

The game was a sophisticated sports game for its time, displaying the playfield using multiple camera angles, including a close-up shot of the batter and pitcher, and giving players the option of selecting relief pitchers or pinch hitters, while an umpire looks on attentively to make the game calls. The game became very popular in Japanese arcades when released in 1983, at one point enjoying a level of popularity comparable to Space Invaders according to Sega. Gameplay The player controls a baseball team, against a computer- controlled team, with the player batting at the top of each inning. In a two- player game, each will play independently against the computer, one inning at a time. Standard baseball rules apply, with the player awarded points for various accomplishments such as hitting a pitch, safely reaching any base, pitching a strike, getting a computer player out, or retiring the computer's side to end an inning. Before play begins, the player can choose which city/state to represent from a list containing Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Pittsburg (probably a typo for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Chicago, Montreal, St. Louis, Boston, Milwaukee, New York City, California and Texas (all of whom had major-league baseball franchises in 1983). The computer then randomly selects from among the remaining cities. If at any time the computer team has scored more runs than the player, the game immediately ends. The high-scores list (\\"FAR OUT PLAYERS\\") can hold the initials of up to six players.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Champion Baseball on their June 1, 1983 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

The field is approximately long by wide and extends along a northwest-southeast line that correlates to the prevailing northerly and westerly wind directions. The name \\"Algodones Dunes\\" refers to the entire geographic feature, while the administrative designation for that portion managed by the Bureau of Land Management is the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area (sometimes called the Glamis Dunes). In 1966, Imperial Sand Hills was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. The Algodones Dunes are split into many different sections. These sections include Glamis, Gordon's Well, Buttercup, Midway, and Patton's Valley. Although the Arabic-derived Spanish word algodones translates to \\"cotton plants\\", the origin of the toponym is unknown. Location Dunes in the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area. The dunes are located west of the Chocolate Mountains in Imperial County, and are crossed by Interstate 8 and State Route 78, which passes through the old train stop of Glamis at the eastern edge of the dune field. The northwestern end is located at about east of Calipatria, California, and the southeastern end is located at near Los Algodones in Mexico, about west of Yuma, Arizona. The dunes are also now separated at the southern end by agricultural land from the much more extensive Gran Desierto de Altar, to which they once were linked as an extreme peripheral \\"finger\\". The only significant human-made structures in the area are the All-American Canal that cuts across the southern portion from east to west and the Coachella Canal on the western edge. History BLM Ranger EMS Rescue vehicles and helicopter drill, Algodones Dunes ORV area Because the Colorado River flowed through very flat terrain, the course of the river varied over a wide area, being periodically diverted in one direction or another by silt deposits remaining after floods. Sometimes the river flowed into the Gulf of California, as it does today (no longer flows into the Gulf of California due to irrigation in the Imperial Valley and Mexicali Valley); other times it turned westward toward the Salton Sink. Each time the Salton Sink received the river flow, a large freshwater lake called Lake Cahuilla formed. The last Lake Cahuilla covered much of the Imperial, Coachella and Mexicali Valleys as late as 1450. The most popular theory holds that the Algodones Dunes were formed from windblown beach sands of Lake Cahuilla. The prevailing westerly and northwesterly winds carried the sand eastward from the old lake shore to their present location which continues to migrate southeast by approximately one foot per year.Where Did the Sand Dunes Come From? Bureau of Land Management. Retrieved on February 18, 2007. The dunes have frequently been a barrier to human movement in the area. Foot travelers frequently diverted south into Mexico, and in 1877 the Southern Pacific Railroad was diverted north to avoid the dunes, but in 1915 Colonel Ed Fletcher built a wooden plank road across the dunes to prove that cars could cross the dunes and to connect San Diego with Yuma, Arizona. This trail eventually became part of Interstate 8. During World War II, the U.S. military conducted desert warfare training on the dunes, which were part of the California-Arizona Maneuver Area. People have been driving on the dunes for recreation almost since vehicles first reached the area, which may have been the proving ground for the first dune buggy, a modified Ford Model A. Off-road driving surged following World War II when surplus Jeeps became available to the public. Current recreational use Presidents Day Weekend. ATVs at Algodones Dunes Lone ATV in Algodones Dunes ATV closeup at Algodones Dunes Environmental protection groups (notably the Center for Biological Diversity) and off- highway vehicle advocacy groups (notably the American Sand Association) have filed numerous petitions and lawsuits to either restrict or re-open vehicular access to the dunes. Most of the dunes located north of State Route 78 are off-limits to vehicular traffic due to designation as the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness. The federal government protected these in the early 1980s and closed them to vehicles as part of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act (Public Law 103-433). Much of the area south of this road remains open for off-highway vehicle use, though a lawsuit in 2000 closed over to vehicular access, leaving about 40% of the recreation area open to vehicles. In 2014, a significant portion (approximately 40,000 acres) of this area was re-opened for vehicular use. It is the largest sand dunes open to off-highway vehicle use in the United States. The site's large sand dunes are a preferred terrain for many off-road vehicle owners. Motorcycles, sandrails, ATVs, and 4-wheel- drive vehicles are commonly driven across the dunes.

As they are the largest dune ecosystem in the United States, there are many species which are endemic to the Algodones system, so the region overall is biologically unique on a global scale. The Algodones were once part of an even greater dune system that now resides primarily in the Mexican state of Sonora, with a few extensions also in southwestern Arizona, especially in the vicinity of Yuma. Accordingly, it is likely that many of the species presently known only from the Algodones also occur in the Gran Desierto de Altar in Mexico, but this is difficult to ascertain without biological surveys of the latter area. *The perennial plant Peirson's milkvetch (Astragalus magdalenae var. peirsonii) is found in the Algodones and is listed as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and as an endangered species under the California Endangered Species Act.Bureau of Land Management, El Centro Field Office.

Life Born of unfree parents, Heimerad undertook pilgrimages in Germany, Italy and Palestine. After his return to Germany he became a monk in Hersfeld Abbey, but was expelled after a dispute about wearing the order's clothing. Nor was he accepted in the monastery at Paderborn. Because of his conspicuous and unusual way of life he was driven from several places, and became more and more desolate. At length he found a site for a hermitage on the Hasunger Berg (today Burghasungen in Zierenberg). At first mocked and scorned even there, with the passage of time he came to be revered as a saint and his advice was sought by the great: he was acquainted with the Empress Kunigunde, Bishop Meinwerk of Paderborn and Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz. He died in 1019, on 28 June, which is his feast day. The main source for his life is the biography written by the monk Ekkebert of Hersfeld between 1072 and 1090. Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz, had a church built over Heimerad's grave on the Hasunger Berg two years after his death, in 1021, which served as the nucleus of Hasungen Abbey, founded in 1074. Pilgrimages to his grave reached their high point in the second half of the 11th century, when Hasungen ranked as the most visited place of pilgrimage in Germany next to the grave of Sebaldus in Nuremberg. In later centuries, especially after the dissolution of Hasungen Abbey in the 16th century, veneration of Heimerad tailed off drastically.

The village is named after a lake, known as Cam Lough, in the parish, which is about 90 acres in extent. South of the village is Camlough Mountain (Slieve Girkin, Sliabh gCuircín) which is part of the Ring of Gullion.See Census 2011 - Headcount and Household Estimates for Settlements published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, available at http://www.sra.gov.census/2011/results/settlements.html The Ring of Gullion (Irish: Fáinne Cnoc Shliabh gCuillinn, meaning \\"hill ring of Slieve Gullion\\") is a geological formation and area and is officially designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, (AONB).  History  There is much evidence of pre-Christian settlers in and around the village: the erection of Dolmens on Camlough Mountain, The Hag's Chair in Lislea and the Ballykeel Dolmen which all point towards Stone Age dwellers. Camlough (Irish: Camloch) was an ecclesiastical district in the Barony of Upper Orior and was anciently part of the O'Hanlon's country. At the time of the Plantation of Ulster, 1000 acres of 12 townlands were granted to Henry McShane O'Neill and the village was developed during this period. Camlough village is in the townland of Cross, referring not to a stone monument but to the village crossroads in the north of the townland. In 1620 Camlough Mountain was known as Sliabh na Croise, meaning 'Mountain of the Cross'. = Camlough Lake = Camlough Lake was formed as a glacial ribbon lake, and takes its name from its irregular shape; although its modern form does not appear particularly crooked, its shape was much less regular in the past before its level was raised by the embankment built in the late 19th century. The glacial left-over sits in a valley carved between Slieve Gullion and Camlough Mountain and is today the largest lake in the Ring of Gullion. Close to the shore of the lake is an approximately one kilometre long tunnel, wide enough to drive an articulated truck into, which was excavated in the 1960s as part of a planned development intended to create a man-made cavern within Camlough Mountain which was to have been used to store and release water to generate electricity. It was planned that the pumped hydro storage scheme, when operational, would generate more than 200 megawatts of electricity had it been completed; however, plans were shelved with the onset of The Troubles. Camlough Mountain (Sliabh gCuircín) The rock that makes up Camlough Mountain is called granodiorite. Granodiorite, just like the rocks that make up Slieve Gullion, forms from the cooling, deep underground, of molten magma. However, unlike the rocks that make up Slieve Gullion and the Ring of Gullion, which were formed around 60 million years ago, the granodiorites of Camlough Mountain are around 400 million years old. Whereas the younger rocks of Gullion are associated with igneous activity related to the formation of the present day Atlantic Ocean, the rocks of Camlough Mountain are associated with igneous activity related to the closure of a precursor to the present day Atlantic, the now long disappeared Lapetus Ocean. Camlough National School Camlough National School was built in 1836 and was located on the Quarter Road. It was divided into a boys' school and a girls' school. The classroom was heated by a pot-bellied stove in the centre of the room and pupils would have been sent to collect sticks for the fire. Mass Rock A Mass Rock (Carraig an Aifrinn), dating from the Penal era, is located in Camlough. It is situated in Grant's Rocks and is over 300 years old. In 2003, a special Mass was held at the Mass Rock in memory of the people who suffered during Penal times. St Malachy's Church, Carrickcruppen, is the oldest church building in the Parish of Lower Killeavy. It was built in 1816 and replaced an earlier church. Kelly's Mill Camlough River is a small meandering stream that makes its way from Camlough to the Newry Canal. It was once a vibrant fast flowing river, teeming with trout and the power source of approximately nine mills. The first of these mills was Kelly's Flax and Scutching Mill in Camlough village. It was situated to the rear of Carragher's house. Established around the mid-18th century, the mill comprised nine buildings, two of which were split level. It was powered by water from two ponds on either side of the Keggal Road. = Irish War of Independence - 1920s = During the Irish War of Independence, the Camlough Company of the Irish Republican Army were active in the area and were commanded by Frank Aiken (1898 –1983). A founding member of the Fianna Fáil political party, Aiken was also Tánaiste from 1965-1969. Aiken was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1923 and at each subsequent election until 1973. He holds the distinction of being the second longest-serving member of Dáil Éireann. As Foreign Minister he developed and maintained an independent stance for Ireland at the United Nations and other international forums such as the Council of Europe, defending the rights of small nations. Aiken also supported the right of countries such as Algeria to self-determination and he was a critic of apartheid in South Africa. Aiken was also a champion of nuclear non- proliferation and he was granted the honour of being the first minister to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 at Moscow. In December 1920, approximately 200 IRA volunteers, led by Aiken, attacked Camlough Royal Irish Constabulary barracks. They exchanged fire with the RIC, threw grenades and set fire to the building. British troops sent from Newry were ambushed by the IRA who opened fire and threw grenades from a bridge overhead. Three volunteers were fatally wounded. The next day, British forces set fire to several homes and businesses in Camlough in reprisal, many of them owned by Aiken's relatives.Lawlor, Pearse. The Outrages: The IRA and the Ulster Special Constabulary in the Border Campaign. Mercier Press, 2011. pp.78-81 = The Troubles = Camlough is situated in South Armagh, which was the most militarised region in Western Europe during the Troubles. The region was a stronghold of support for the Provisional IRA, earning it the nickname 'Bandit Country' (see Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade). On 19 May 1981, five British soldiers were killed in an Irish Republican Army (IRA) landmine attack on the Chancellors Road 3 miles from Camlough. The soldiers had been travelling in a Saracen armoured personnel carrier when the bomb exploded.

Local Swimmer and CLWF Chairman Padraig Mallon then went on to complete the English and North Channel in the same year (only 3rd person to ever do so). His sister Colleen Mallon went on to break the Irish record for crossing the North Channel in 2014 and Keith Garry completed the English Channel in 2014. The area has also produced 2 successful relay teams crossing the North Channel and world-class ice swimmers. Camlough Rovers F.C. is the local football team, playing in the Mid-Ulster Football League. Camloch is famous for its links with the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The village hosts two Gaelic football clubs. St Patrick's Carrickcruppen GFC has won four Senior county championships; Shane O'Neill's GAC, a continuation of the first Camloch club (William O'Brien's, founded in 1888), has won two Senior and three Junior titles. Craobh Rua Camloch hurling club was established in 1991 in the Camlough and Bessbrook areas of South Armagh. As hurling had not been played in the area in some 40 years, the club received some help from Armagh Hurling Board chairman, Jimmy Carlisle, who helped set up coaching courses for the children and their mentors. Over its first ten years the club has successfully fielded teams at under 12, under 14, under 16 and since 2010 at under 8, minor and senior levels. They play their home games at Dunster Park (An Dún Rua) on High Street, Derrymore. In 2010 the Seniors reached the Junior Championship Final and subsequently made it to the semi-final of the Ulster championship. The Under 14s won the 2010 Championship and the Feile, and represented County Armagh in the All Ireland Feile in Ennis, where they reached the semi-final. There are currently three Craobh Rua players representing Armagh at senior inter-county level, Fiachra Bradley, Micheal Garvey and Ryan Lewis. = World Record = A Guinness World Record for the longest open water relay swim was broken by a team of intrepid swimmers at Camlough Lake in South Armagh on Saturday 19 September 2009. The group beat the world record for a 'continuous long distance relay swim' after embarking on the world beating attempt over a week before. Two hundred swimmers from across Ireland took part in the challenge. The previous record was 480 km; Camlough set the record at 680 km.

Sandra Bullock, Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey star, with Oliver Platt, Ashley Judd, and Kiefer Sutherland, and Patrick McGoohan appearing in supporting roles. Set in Mississippi, the film involves the rape of a young girl, the arrest of the rapists, their subsequent murder by the girl's father, and the father's trial for murder. The film was a critical and commercial success, making $152 million at the worldwide box office. It is the second of two films based on Grisham's novels directed by Joel Schumacher, with the other being The Client released two years prior. Plot In the town of Canton, Mississippi, ten- year-old African American Tonya Hailey (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly) is abducted, raped, and beaten by two local white men, Billy Ray Cobb (Nicky Katt) and Pete Willard (Doug Hutchison). The duo dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her. Tonya survives, and the two men are arrested by Sheriff Ozzie Walls (Charles S. Dutton). Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), contacts Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey), a white lawyer who previously defended his brother. Brigance admits the possibility that the rapists will walk free. Carl Lee goes to the county courthouse and opens fire with an automatic rifle, killing both rapists and unintentionally injuring Deputy Dwayne Looney (Chris Cooper) with a ricochet, whose leg is later amputated. Carl Lee is arrested and Brigance agrees to defend him. The rape and subsequent revenge killing gain national media attention. The district attorney, Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey), decides to seek the death penalty, and presiding Judge Omar Noose (Patrick McGoohan) denies Brigance a change of venue to a more ethnically-diverse county, meaning that Carl Lee will have an all-white jury. Brigance seeks help from his defense team: law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), close friend Harry Rex Vonner (Oliver Platt), and former mentor and longtime activist Lucien Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland), a once-great civil rights lawyer. Meanwhile, Billy Ray's brother, Freddie Lee Cobb (Kiefer Sutherland), plans to avenge his brother's death by joining and enlisting the help of the Mississippi branch of the Ku Klux Klan and its Grand Dragon, Stump Sisson (Kurtwood Smith). On the first day of the trial, the Klan rallies, only to be outnumbered by counter-protesters consisting of the area's black and multiracial residents, as well as whites who support Carl Lee. The protest erupts into a violent riot that results in dozens of injuries and the death of Stump Sisson. The Klan also begins to target Brigance, assaulting his elderly secretary (Brenda Fricker) and her husband, who dies of a heart attack brought on by the assault. They also burn a cross on his lawn and threaten his wife and daughter. When Brigance refuses to back down, Cobb kidnaps and assaults Roark. The Klan then increases their attacks, including burning Brigance's house. Dispirited, Brigance tells Carl Lee that there is little hope for an acquittal. Carl Lee replies that he had chosen him as an attorney because even a racist jury would listen to a white man — as \\"one of the bad guys,\\" he has an influence that a black man will never have. During closing arguments, a deeply-shaken Brigance tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the entire ordeal of Tonya. Brigance then asks the jury, in his final comment, to \\"now imagine she's white.\\" After deliberation, a black child runs out of the courthouse and screams, \\"He's innocent!\\" Jubilation ensues amongst the supporters outside. The Klan members, enraged, begin yelling in anger. Meanwhile, Sheriff Walls arrests Freddie Lee for his crimes, as well as a corrupt deputy who is also a member of the Klan and is standing next to the sheriff. Brigance brings his wife and daughter to a family cookout at Carl Lee's house to celebrate his freedom. Cast * Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance * Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roark * Samuel L.

It reached number one during its first two weeks and grossed over $108 million domestically.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3933505025/weekend/ =Critical reception= The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 67% based on 54 reviews, a critical consensus reading: \\"Overlong and superficial, A Time to Kill nonetheless succeeds on the strength of its skillful craftsmanship and top-notch performances\\". It has a score of 54 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 21 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"A\\" on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying: \\"I was absorbed by A Time to Kill, and found the performances strong and convincing,\\" and added that \\"this is the best of the film versions of Grisham novels, I think, and it has been directed with skill by Joel Schumacher.\\" The film was not without its detractors. Anthony Puccinelli gave the film one star, calling it \\"worthless\\" and remarking: \\"A Time to Kill argues for vigilantism but disguises its message by making the vigilante black, allowing viewers to think their blood lust and thirst for revenge is actually empathy for the oppressed.\\" Peter Travers felt that \\"they [Schumacher and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman] cram[med] in too much,\\" adding, \\"This distracts from the heart of the picture, which is in the bond between Carl Lee (the brilliant [Samuel L.] Jackson is quietly devastating) and Jake, a husband and father who knows he, too, would have shot anyone who raped his little girl.\\" Gene Siskel remarked it was \\"An overwrought, contrived courtroom thriller\\", \\"cornball\\" and concluded \\"This story has been recycled out of countless better movies.\\" Grisham enjoyed the film, remarking: \\"When all was said and done I was happy with it, happy we were able to find a kid like Matthew McConaughey. It wasn't a great movie, but it was a good one.\\" Reaction in France In France, the film has been the subject of controversy. Critics have accused the movie of making an apology for the death penalty and right of self-defense. A question mark was added at the end of the title (\\"Le Droit de tuer ?\\"/\\"The Right to Kill ?\\"A time to kill – Cinémathèque française ) so as not to shock the audience. Amnesty International France uses the word \\"disturbing\\" when referring to the film in one of its documents. Les Inrockuptibles described the film as \\"nauseating\\", \\"stinking\\", almost \\"fascist\\", with an \\"ultra-populist\\" script that makes one want to \\"vomit\\".Les Inrocks : Le Droit de tuer ? Libération criticized the script, calling it \\"extremely dirty\\": the movie, says the newspaper, \\"militates in favour of the black cause only to legitimize, after many plot buckles (resurrection of the Ku Klux Klan, the deceits of court, threats of many kinds) the mentally ill gesture of the avenging father\\". According to Libération, the movie \\"justifies the indefensible\\" with a \\"dripping sentimentalism\\". =Accolades= * Golden Globe – Best Supporting Actor – Samuel L.

A 1993 study revealed structural problems (the roof was never designed to support microwave antennas, but only a coffee shop); before a major reconstruction project could be started in 1997, engineers had to begin by redrawing building plans, as the originals had been lost. Works included reconstruction to duplicate the original façade, as well as structural reinforcement. The reconstruction design was made by Romanian architecture office Proiect Bucuresti. The whole Project, which ultimately employed 700 people, cost roughly €1 million and lasted until 2005.Nuta 2005.

In painting, Thorsen painted a number of abstract works, which have become increasingly collectible. He also stirred up controversy with a work depicting Jesus in a manner some considered pornographic. Thorsen planned a film called The Many Faces of Jesus, later The Sex Life of Jesus, and was to have involved both heterosexual and homosexual acts. The film plans met with strong national and international protests and accusations of blasphemy so the Danish Film Academy withdrew its financial support.

It is one of seven Quaker Schools in England. The school (or more accurately its Head) is a member of the Headmasters' & Headmistresses' Conference\\"HMC Schools A -C\\" ; Headmasters' & Headmistresses' Conference. Retrieved 3 June 2012 and SHMIS\\"SHMIS Member Schools\\"; Internet Archive, SHMIS. Retrieved 3 June 2012 The Head is Anton Maree, who took over at the beginning of the 2014–2015 academic year.School press release for the new headteacher The Deputy Heads are Sam Baker and Jeffrey Swales. The school has a nursery that takes children aged 2 1/2 to 4, a Junior School that takes children age 5 to 11, and the Senior School for students aged 11 to 18. The boarding facilities cater for pupils from 10 years of age. Originally it was a boarding school for Quaker children. Today most of the school's pupils are day pupils. There are more than 27 different nationalities in the boarding houses. Most of today's pupils are not Quakers, but the school retains a strong Quaker ethos and is able to offer means-tested Bursary awards to children from Quaker and non-Quaker families. There is a very short Quaker-style silence at assembly and before meals. Once a week the School meets for a longer Meeting for Worship. History The school was founded by John Fothergill and others in 1779 as a boarding school for Quaker boys and girls. Prior to the school's foundation, the buildings housed a foundling hospital created by Thomas Coram.The History of Ackworth School. School life =Houses= The school has four houses: Woolman, Gurney, Penn and Fothergill. Penn, Gurney and Woolman were all famous Quakers, and John Fothergill was the founder of the school. Every pupil is assigned to one of the four houses at the start of their time at the school for inter-house events, which include sport, music, drama, poetry and art. Students are also divided for meals according to their houses. =Uniform= The school uniform consists of grey trousers, grey socks, light blue shirt, navy school tie, and navy-blue jumper for boys, and navy skirt, blue-and- white-striped blouse, and navy jumper for girls. Blazers are also part of the uniform for First-Fifth Year (Secondary School age). The sixth form boys wear a white shirt and grey trousers with a burgundy jumper or black blazer, while sixth-form girls wear a white blouse and Navy skirt with a burgundy jumper. =Music= The school has a strong musical tradition. In 1995, a purpose- built music facility was built on the site of one of the old boarding houses, comprising a recital hall with seating for 180, 14 practice rooms, 2 classrooms, a music library and a recording studio. Summer schools are sometimes held there during school holidays. In January 2019, Ackworth School became the 15th member of the All-Steinway Group of Schools. =Boarding= Boarders live in separate boys' and girls' boarding houses. Until 1997, the school timetable included Saturday morning lessons, leaving Wednesday afternoons free, providing a more-balanced week for boarders. The changing demographic of the school has led to this being phased out. =Sixth Form= When students reach the sixth form, they are all allocated a shared or single study in designated areas. There are two study blocks for Lower Sixth (known as the West Wing Studies and the Old Art Block), and two for Upper Sixth (known as the Fothergill Studies and the Old Library). Sixth formers have free periods during which they are encouraged to study. Students must stay within school premises during these free periods. =Charity Week= Each year in the week before October half term is Ackworth's Charity Week. Two charities, one national and one international, are chosen for which the school then raises money through a series of events. Included within these events are cake stalls, auctions, concerts and the sale of doughnuts and hot dogs. One event involves putting sixth formers in stocks and allowing younger students to throw water at them. One of the most-popular events of Charity Week is the staff/sixth-form entertainment. The sixth form and certain members of staff are encouraged to prepare a series of sketches to entertain younger students. In the middle of the event, a fund-raising activity occurs, where the sixth form raise money from the other students. On 18 October the school celebrates Founder's Day, the day on which in 1779 the school was founded. The whole school gathers in the Meeting House and sings the Founder's Day Hymn before each year group departs on a day trip, usually a walk. Union with other Quaker schools In 2007, the National Quaker Choral Festival was held at the school, where pupils from Quakers schools all over England came to sing in a large choir to Karl Jenkins' \\"The Armed Man\\". On 28 March 2009, the Bridge Film Festival — which had been held at Brooklyn Friends School, located in Brooklyn, New York, for the last nine years — was held at the school. It is a Quaker film festival in which students make a film which is judged and prizes are awarded. The school entered the 2008 festival, sending several students to Brooklyn Friends School to witness the festival. For the 2009 festival, student Simon Waldock prepared a film about the history of the school; the film involved an interview with a former scholar from the 1950s.Ackworth School's entry for the 2009 Bridge Film Festival The film did not win but was commended by judges.

History The 141st Signal Battalion dates back to 1 June 1940, when it was activated at Fort Knox, Kentucky, as the 7th Signal Troop (Mechanized). It was later redesignated the 47th Signal Company (Armored), and assigned to the 1st Armored Division. On 12 August 1941, the organization's designation was changed to the 141st Armored Signal Company. Detachments of the 141st were in the initial assault waves on the beaches of North Africa as part of Operation Torch in 1942. The 141st supported the 1st Armored Division as it fought its way across the African coast, capturing Oran and cleaning out Tunisia. It was part of the division's spearhead in the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. The official history of the United States Army in World War II says of the unit during this period, \\"This unit was undoubtedly one of the best signal outfits in the Army…. The service provided by this crack unit suggested how effective communications could be in the hands of experienced troops.\\" After the Africa Campaign, the 141st moved to Italy, landing at Salerno. It fought as part of the 1st Armored Division at Anzio, Rome and Naples; participated in the campaign of the Italian Mountains, and was with the division when it captured Milan. The battalion colors carry campaign streamers from World War II for Tunisia, Anzio, Naples-Foggia, Rome-Arno, Po Valley and North Apennines. After World War II, in February 1946, the 1st Armored Division and the 141st redeployed to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, where it was inactivated on 26 April 1946. During the Korean War, the unit was reactivated in March 1951 at Fort Hood, Texas, but did not deploy. In February 1957, the 141st Signal Company was reorganized as a battalion but was shortly deactivated again in December 1957. Its current active status dates from February 1960. In August 1971, the 141st Signal Battalion began deployment to Ansbach, Germany, where it began its current history as a forward-deployed European-based Battalion. On 20 December 1990, the 141st Signal Battalion was deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Desert Shield. The battalion provided front line communications to the 1st Armored Division in the fast-moving VII Corps campaign to destroy Iraqi forces during Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait. B Company was awarded the Valorous Unit Award. Upon redeployment from Southwest Asia, the colors of the 141st Signal Battalion relocated to Bad Kreuznach, Germany, where, on 26 November 1991, they replaced those of the 8th Signal Battalion. In December 1995, advance elements of the battalion deployed with the 1st Armored Division to Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. In September 1997, the battalion again deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) deployed in support of Operation Joint Guard. The battalion returned to Bad Kreuznach in June 1998. In June 2000, elements of the battalion deployed to Kosovo to support the 1st Armored Division's peace- keeping mission. In May 2001, the battalion relocated its headquarters from Bad Kreuznach to Wiesbaden Army Airfield, now Lucius D. Clay Kaserne. In May 2003, the battalion was deployed as part of 1st AD to OIF 1. On 1 May 2007 141 Signal Battalion was inactivated. Remnants of the 141st Signal Battalion became the 146th Signal Company under the Special Troops Battalion (STB) of the 1st Armored Division.

A riding habit is women's clothing for horseback riding. Since the mid-17th century, a formal habit for riding sidesaddle usually consisted of: * A tailored jacket with a long skirt (sometimes called a petticoat) to match * A tailored shirt or chemisette * A hat, often in the most formal men's style of the day (since the Victorian era, a top hat with a veil has been worn) Low-heeled boots, gloves, and often a necktie or stock complete the ensemble. Typically, throughout the period the riding habit used details from male dress, whether large turned cuffs, gold trims or buttons. The colours were very often darker and more masculine than those on normal clothes. Earlier styles can be similar to the dresses worn by boys before breeching in these respects. When high waists were the fashion, from roughly 1790 to 1820, the habit could be a coat dress called a riding coat (borrowed in French as redingote) or a petticoat with a short jacket (often longer in back than in front). Origins In France in the 17th century, women who rode wore an outfit called a devantiere. The skirt of the devantiere was split up the back to enable astride riding. By the early 19th century, in addition to describing the whole costume, a devantiere could describe any part of the riding habit, be it the skirt, the apron, or the riding coat. In his diary for June 12, 1666, Samuel Pepys wrote: : Walking in the galleries at White Hall, I find the Ladies of Honour dressed in their riding garbs, with coats and doublets with deep skirts, just, for all the world, like mine; and buttoned their doublets up to the breast, with periwigs under their hats; so that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men's coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever; which was an odde sight, and a sight did not please me. Two and a half centuries later, Emily Post would write: :A riding habit, no matter what the fashion happens to be, is like a uniform, in that it must be made and worn according to regulations. It must above all be meticulously trig and compact. Nothing must be sticking out a thousandth part of an inch that can be flattened in...Keep the idea of perfect clothes for men in mind, get nothing that the smartest man would not wear, and you can’t go wrong...Correct riding clothes are not fashion but form! Whether coat skirts are long or short, full or plain, and waists wasp-like or square, the above admonitions have held for many decades, and are likely to hold for many more. Women's redingote Woman's redingote, c. 1790. Silk and cotton satin and plain weave. Los Angeles County Museum of Art, M.2009.120.Takeda and Spilker (2010), pp. 82–83 The redingote (or redingotte, redingot)Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, September 2009 is a type of coat that has had several forms over time. The name is derived from a French alteration of the English \\"riding coat\\", an example of reborrowing. The first form of the redingote was in the 18th century, when it was used for travel on horseback. This coat was a bulky, utilitarian garment. It would begin to evolve into a fashionable accessory in the last two decades of the 18th century, when women began wearing a perfectly tailored style of the redingote, which was inspired by men's fashion of the time. Italian fashion also picked it up (the redingotte), adapting it for more formal occasions. The redingote à la Hussar (from French redingote à la Hussarde) was trimmed with parallel rows of horizontal braid in the fashion of Hussars' uniforms. The style continued to evolve through the late 19th century, until it took a form similar to today's redingote. The newer form is marked by a close fit at the chest and waist, a belt, and a flare toward the hem. =Gallery= Image:Morland squires door detail.jpgWoman's redingote, c. 1790 Image:Redingote a la hussar.jpgRedingote à la Hussar, 1817 File:Fig9REDINGOTEdrap carreaux fanraisie.pngRedingote of 1887 File:Redingote-polonaise-1914.png'Redingote polonaise' (left) from a McCall advertisement, 1914 Style gallery Image:Joseph Parrocel, attributed to - Madame La Comtesse de Saint Géran - Google Art Project.jpg1 - c.1680 Image:Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy.jpg2 - c.1700 Image:Ladyworsley.jpg3 Lady Worsley - 1776 Image:Morland squires door detail.jpg4 - 1790 Image:1799 Riding Habit July LMM.jpg5 - 1799 Image:Riding habit 1830s.jpg6 - 1830s Image:Lovers-Morning-Recreation-Sarony-Major-1850.jpg7 - 1850s #Madame La Comtesse de Saint Géran in a riding habit with a masculine-styled jacket and waistcoat, c.1680 #Marie Adélaïde de Savoie, Duchesse de Bourgogne in a scarlet riding habit, with male cuffs, gold trim, and buttons, early 18th century #Lady Worsley in a riding habit with a cutaway coat and waistcoat, and military details from the uniform of her husband's regiment, then in America fighting the rebels, 1776. #Button-front redingote of 1790, worn with a tall hat. #Fashion plate of 1799. #1830s habits show the popular full sleeves of the day. #1850s habit, worn with fashionable ringlets under a top hat.

It has a picturesque harbour on the shores of Carnlough Bay. Carnlough is on the Coast Road beside the North Channel and at the foot of Glencloy, the second of the nine Glens of Antrim. It is situated in Mid and East Antrim district, as well the historic barony of Glenarm Lower, and the civil parishes of Ardclinis and Tickmacrevan. It had a population of 2,084 people in 2016. History The harbour was built by the owners of the quarries west of the village. These were connected to the harbour by means of a mineral tramway network, which include a bridge over each of two parallel streets in the village (both of which remain today). The harbour has recently been renovated and is used by pleasure boats and small fishing boats. The area offers many opportunities for both sea angling and fresh water angling. The Londonderry Arms Hotel was built in 1848 as a coaching inn by Frances Anne Vane Tempest, Marchioness of Londonderry, great grandmother of Winston Churchill. In the school, St McNissis, now known as St Killians, was originally built as a summer residence by Frances Anne. Education There are three main educational institutions in the area. These are: St.John's Primary School, St Killian's College, and Carnlough Controlled Integrated Primary School. The latter was known as Carnlough Primary School up until 2004 - but as the non Roman Catholic population began to dwindle, numbers fell at the school. A primary school in nearby Glenarm has since closed and the two schools have now merged into one integrated school. Sport =Football= There were two IFA junior football teams based in the village. They were Carnlough United and Glencloy Swifts. Carnlough United were founded in 1964 and started off in the now defunct Larne and District Junior League. In 1994 they joined the Ballymena Saturday Morning League. At the beginning of season 2007-2008, Carnlough United entered the Junior Division 2 section of the Ballymena and Provincial League. Glencloy Swifts were established in 1994 and following one season in the Larne and District League, they entered Division 3 of the Ballymena Saturday Morning League. They spent several seasons struggling in the lower reaches of Division 3, before finally becoming a force at the turn of the millennium. Glencloy Swifts secured their first trophy in 2003 when they won the Crawford Cup. In 2009 Carnlough United and Glencloy Swifts merged to become Carnlough Swifts. Carnlough Swifts play in the first division of the Ballymena Saturday Morning League. The Club's reserve team play in the Ballymena & Provincial League Junior Division 3 Glencloy Ladies, now defunct, played in the NIWFA League. Carnlough man Brendan Rodgers is the current Leicester manager, a former Northern Ireland schoolboy international and manager of Chelsea reserves, and the former manager of Liverpool F.C. He previously managed Celtic, Swansea, Reading and Watford. In his first season as Swansea manager he led them to promotion to the top flight of English football for the first time since 1983. In 2016, he won his first major trophy as a manager, when he guided Celtic to the Scottish League Cup, completing an undefeated domestic treble later that season. =Gig rowing= Four oared gig racing has a measure of popularity in Carnlough. Up until recently craft for this sport were the product of local boat builders and during the summer crews may be seen training out on the bay. A highlight of the gig racing calendar is the Annual Regatta which takes place in May and attracts crews from all over the country to take part in the Round the Rock Challenge. The local rowing club is Carnlough Rowing Club, who have over 100 members and are part of the Irish Coastal Rowing Federation. The club's ladies section competed at the 2007 All Ireland Championships which were held at Union Hall, County Cork. In 2008 the Veteran Ladies won a bronze at the All Irelands which was held in Cairndhu. 2009's All Ireland a combined crew of Glenarm and Carnlough won a silver in the Veteran Men. The club was featured on the BBC documentary programme Coast. =Camogie= Carnlough are represented in the Antrim Camogie Association by the St John's club, where they are represented at U12 and U16 level. From March 2008 St. John's started a Senior Camogie team who contest in the 3rd Div of the all county league. Numbers have increased from last year and the club is going from strength to strength. =Other Sports= Other popular sports in the village include, darts, pool, gunsports, golf, hurling, Gaelic football, angling, and walking. Politics Carnlough lies within the Carnlough electoral ward of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council's Coast Road District electoral division. Of the five electoral wards which make up the Coast Road district electoral area Carnlough is the only ward with a Nationalist majority and the only majority Nationalist ward in the whole of the former Larne Borough Council area.

Although Kralj Petar Krešimir IV was plagued with engine malfunctions and other equipment problems throughout its service life, it continues to serve with the Flotilla of the Croatian Navy along with four other missile boats. The ship was the main motive for a series of postage stamps issued by the Hrvatska pošta as well as souvenir coins.  Design and construction  Kralj Petar Krešimir IV was laid down in 1991 in the Kraljevica Shipyard as the first ship of the new Kobra-class missile boats that were planned for the Yugoslav Navy (JRM). The ship was to be named after Sergej Mašera (pennant number RTOP-501) who prevented the destroyer Zagreb from falling into Italian hands during the Invasion of Yugoslavia. As the Croatian War of Independence broke out, shipyard workers stalled the completion of the ship until all of the Yugoslav Forces retreated following the Battle of the Barracks so they could not take the ship with them. It was launched on 21 March 1992. Although there were proposals to name the ship after the city of Vukovar that was heavily damaged during the Battle of Vukovar, Franjo Tuđman, Croatian president at the time, suggested naming the ship in accordance with Croatia's naval history. Petar Krešimir IV carries the name of a Croatian medieval king (\\"kralj\\" meaning \\"king\\"), Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia, who is often viewed in Croatia as having expanded the kingdom of Croatia to incorporate the Dalmatian coast and its islands. Kralj Petar Krešimir IV measures in length, has a beam of and draught of . Fully loaded the ship displaces while standard displacement measures . Propulsion consists of three Zvezda M504B-2 diesel engines mounted on three shafts, putting out which enables a maximum speed of and a continuous speed of . At a speed of the ship has a range of with a 10-day endurance. The ship has a complement of 33, consisting of six officers, 19 NCOs and eight seamen. The ship's principal armament consists of 4-8 RBS-15 anti-ship missiles. Gun armament consists of a single Bofors 57 mm D70 on the ship's bow and a single AK-630 CIWS placed on a higher position towards the stern. Four AIM-70 or six SAG-1 naval mines can be deployed in place of the missile launchers. Self-defense systems are made of two Wallop \\"Barricade\\" chaff/infrared decoy launchers paired with radar and laser radiation detectors. Ship sensors include a Racal-Decca BT 502 surface search and Racal-Decca 1290A navigational radar mounted on the ship's mast, as well as a Philips PEAB 9LV 249 Mk2 fire-control radar mounted above the bridge and used for guiding the ship's gun armament. A RIZ PP10M sonar is used for detecting underwater special forces operating in the near vicinity of the ship.  Service history  The ship's name on the port side of the hull Kralj Petar Krešimir IV was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 7 June 1992. On 28 October 1992 Tuđman arrived on the island of Vis onboard Petar Krešimir IV escorted by the missile boat Dubrovnik and the torpedo boat Vukovar. The next day Petar Krešimir IV transported Tuđman to the city of Dubrovnik. In October 1994, Kralj Petar Krešimir IV and Šibenik (RTOP-21) participated in the \\"Posejdon '94\\" exercise conducted jointly with the Croatian Air Force and Air Defence. The event was the first time Croatian Navy ships live fired an RBS-15 anti-ship missile and would also be the only instance of the RBS-15 missiles being used for the next 21 years. The next live firings didn't happen until 2015 when a single missile was launched from a coastal launcher and another one from Petar Krešimir IVs sister ship, Kralj Dmitar Zvonimir (RTOP-12). The ship's engines proved to be problematic since it was commissioned; because they were designed for providing high speed bursts during a short period of time, they're not suited for longer patrols at lower speeds, have a high fuel consumption and have been partially operational for most of the time; problems that would plague Kralj Petar Krešimir IV throughout its service life. In 2004 one of its engines was out of order with the two remaining ones in need of an overhaul. The fire control system for the ship to ship missiles was non operational for some time at that point. A 2005 study highlighted the need for the modernization of Kralj Petar Krešimir IV with its engines and combat systems being designated as a priority. In June 2006 the Ministry of Defense issued the Croatian Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan 2006–2015 (hr. Dugoročni plan razvoja Oružanih snaga Republike Hrvatske 2006–2015) in which it was stated that one of the Navy's priorities was equipping Kralj Petar Krešimir IV with new engines and anti-aircraft systems. The planned modernisation wasn't carried out, instead the ship was docked and underwent only basic maintenance during 2010. Kralj Petar Krešimir IV during the Croatian Navy Day on 18 September 2009 in Rijeka. On 28 August 2008 Slobodna Dalmacija reported that certain countries were interested in buying Kralj Petar Krešimir IV, among them Georgia who lost most its fleet during the Russia–Georgia war; according to the report, the deal was stopped by Russia. Although the MoD declined to comment on the potential sale to Georgia, they did confirm that they would consider offers if any were given, as well as that the ship would remain in service until a deal was made. In 2010 frigate lieutenant Antonija Didović assumed command of Kralj Petar Krešimir IV becoming the first female commander in the Navy's history. Didović began her officer career in January 2006 as the commanding officer of the Ship's Weapon Section (Oružni brodski odred) before being promoted to first officer in 2008 and finally commander on 1 July 2010. A report about the state of the armed forces in 2011 stressed out the inoperability of the engines on Petar Krešimir IV as the single biggest maintenance problem for the Navy. In November 2013 the MoD announced the overhaul of Kralj Petar Krešimir IV as one of their plans for 2014. Work on the ship which included a major overhaul of its engines, was finished by 18 June 2014 at the Prgin nautical center in Šibenik. After a test drive at maximum speed, the ship was once again declared fully operational; for the first time since mid-2011 when it was out of service because of technical problems.  Accolades  Kralj Petar Krešimir IV was featured in a series of postage stamps issued by the Hrvatska pošta named \\"Hrvatsko brodovlje\\" (en. Croatian ships). Published from 27 August 1998, the series was printed in two million copies. In 2012 the Croatian Numismatic Club issued a souvenir coin marking the 20th anniversary of the ship being launched.

Midway in the main avenue (later Karl Johans gate) Linstow wanted a monumental square to be surrounded by the University, the Parliament and other public buildings Hans Ditlev Franciscus (Frants) von Linstow (4 May 1787 – 10 June 1851) was a Danish-born, Norwegian architect. He was one of the more significant architects in Norway during his lifetime. He is well known to have designed the Royal Palace in Oslo and much of the surrounding park and the street Karl Johans gate. Bjørn Cappelen. Hans Ditlev Frantz Linstow Norsk biografisk leksikon Background Hans Ditlev Franciscus von Linstow was born in Nord- Sjælland, Denmark. His parents were Hartvig Christoph von Linstow (1740–1823) and Charlotta Benedicta Eleonora von der Lühe (1753–1837). Linstow belonged to a noble family from Mecklenburg who were naturalized in Denmark. He grew up in Hirschholm Castle (Hirschholm Slot) in North Zealand. He matriculated in 1805 and earned a law degree at Copenhagen University in 1812. He first studied painting and drawings at the Art Academy in Copenhagen, Denmark, while he at the same time studied law. Career After finalizing these studies in 1812, he went to Kongsberg, Norway (which then was united with Denmark) and studied in 1812–1814 at the so-called Bergakademiet, which educated military engineers. He did not, however, complete this military education, but studied architecture at the same time. He worked at the Danish Royal Court in 1814, but at the dissolution of the union between Denmark and Norway the same year, he went to Norway and worked in 1815–1820 as a military lawyer at the cavalry. In 1818, he was one of the initiators of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Christiania. He taught, first plaster, and later building construction until he took his leave in 1840. In 1823, he was commissioned to design the new Royal Palace (Det Kongelige Slott) in Christiania and create the surrounding park, where he also drew the guards' house. He also helped his friend, the writer Henrik Wergeland in constructing his new house Grotten in the outskirts of the park. Both these buildings are examples of his early use of the Swiss chalet style in his drawings.Architecture of the Royal Palace (Kongehuset.no) Since the Royal Palace was erected outside the main city area, Linstow proposed a plan in 1838 to connect the palace to the city. The main parts of this plan were realized in what is now the main boulevard and tourist area, the Karl Johans gate. In 1828–1835, Linstow worked on a set of standard drawings for Norwegian churches. About seventy different churches were erected all over Norway based on these drawings. Legacy In 1885, a street Linstows gate in Christiania was named for him.

The Bleacher Creatures are a group of fans of the New York Yankees who are known for their strict allegiance to the team and their merciless attitude to opposing fans. The group's nickname was coined for the first time by New York Daily News columnist Filip \\"Flip\\" Bondy during the 1990s, and then he spent the 2004 season sitting with the Creatures for research on his book about the group, Bleeding Pinstripes: A Season with the Bleacher Creatures of Yankee Stadium, which was published in 2005. A prominent aspect of the Bleacher Creatures is their use of chants and songs. The most distinguished of these is the Roll Call, which is done at the beginning of every home game. Often, the opposing team's right fielder, who stands right in front of the Creatures, is a victim of their jeers and insults. For the last two decades of the original Yankee Stadium, the Creatures occupied sections 37 and 39 of the bleachers. In 2009, When the Yankees' new stadium was built, they were relocated and currently sit in Section 203 of the right-field bleachers. History The seat with a plaque dedicated to Ali Ramirez in old Yankee Stadium: Section 39, row A, seat 29 The founding of the Bleacher Creatures is often credited to Ali Ramirez. Ramirez rang a cowbell to inspire the fans to cheer (much like Freddy Sez's efforts in the Stadium's main grandstand) during the team's limited success in the early 1980s and 1990s. He died on May 8, 1996, and was given a tribute by the Yankees front office before the May 14 game against the Seattle Mariners, a game in which Dwight Gooden pitched a no-hitter. There was a plaque where he sat, in section 39, row A, seat 29 which read \\"This seat is taken. In memory of Ali Ramirez, 'The Original Bleacher Creature.'\\" A similar plaque was added to the new stadium,. and is cleaned by a Creature at the start of every game. The plaque is located at section 203, row 7, seat 25. It was also during this period of drought that regular fans in the right field bleachers started chanting Dave Winfield's name. When Winfield left the team, they began cheering for Bernie Williams. During one game in the 1990s, the fans started chanting the name of Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez. Martinez responded to the chanting fans with a wave, shocking the cheering fans; this started the tradition of Roll Call where the Bleacher Creatures chant the name of each starting fielder (except the pitcher and catcher). Roll Call has become one of the trademarks of Yankee Stadium. In 1996, New York Daily News columnist Filip \\"Flip\\" Bondy was asked to write a story from the fan's perspective. Bondy approached what he called \\"a core group of the most rabid, passionate fans\\", and wrote from their perspective. In that regular column, he took on the persona of \\"the Bleacher Creature,\\" coining the nickname in relation to the Yankee Stadium inhabitants. Because of the rowdiness of the fans, and the fact that many families began sitting in the more affordable bleachers, alcoholic beverages were banned from the bleachers in 2000.Bondy, ibid., p. 20-22. Yankees Program Vendor Ted Banks commented that \\"There wasn't any special reason for that, it just got out of hand. Those people used to get wild when Jose Canseco played for the A's. A few people threw things at Ken Griffey Jr.\\" On April 5, 2002, pitcher David Cone spent the season's home opener with the Bleacher Creatures in Section 39, and even participated in their chants. He was also invited to start the roll call, and did so with a shout of \\"Yo, Bernie!\\" to Bernie Williams. The Creatures cheered derisively to the right field box seats \\"We got Cone! We got Cone!\\" After the final game played at Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008, Tino Martinez revealed that he had sat with the Creatures during the game the day before. Martinez said he wore a Yankees jacket, glasses and a hat, and that no one recognized him. Jim Leyritz expressed interest in sitting with the creatures on an episode of the YES Network show Ultimate Road Trip. He was spotted in the bleachers taking pictures during the final game at Yankee Stadium, but it is unknown whether he actually sat and watched the game from the bleachers. left In 2004, Bondy spent the season among the Creatures and wrote a book about his experience, entitling it Bleeding Pinstripes: A Season with the Bleacher Creatures of Yankee Stadium, which was published in 2005. In the blurb, Bondy called it \\"a unique, anthropological view of this most dedicated tribe of rooters—their rituals, their personal tribulations, their uncanny commitment to the Bronx ball club and to each other.\\" The foreword was written by David Cone. The Yankees and NYPD security personnel started to impose stricter anti-obscenity rules in the Bleachers during the 2007 season. Some Creatures expressed dissatisfaction with this by wearing T-shirts with the sarcastic phrase \\"Section 39 Fun Police\\" on them, and chanting \\"No fun allowed!\\" in place of the oft-said \\"Box Seats Suck!\\" chant that the section had long been accustomed to. In 2009, the Yankees lifted the 9-year alcohol ban in the bleachers in the New Yankee Stadium, where the Bleacher Creatures were relocated to Section 203. While no beer vendors come through to the bleachers, fans are permitted to purchase beer in the stadium and take them back to their seats. A few Creatures have admittedly stated they can now desist in their beer smuggling efforts, which they were able to do for years with the help of local delis who used to wrap up sandwiches with beer cans. Other sources of previous smuggling included \\"a guy who would sell those airline-size liquor bottles out of a bathroom stall, like a drug dealer.\\" An April 2009 segment on ABC World News Tonight revealed that the end of the beer ban is a temporary experiment, and if things get out of hand in the section, the Yankees' management might reinstate it. Chants and songs A prominent aspect of the Bleacher Creatures atmosphere is their use of a variety of chants and songs used during the game that are unique to their section. These chants can sometimes be heard throughout the Stadium. =Roll Call= Bald Vinny, calling out the center fielder's name to begin the Roll Call. The Creatures' most famous and long- standing chant is known as the roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their starting pitcher is getting ready to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, whoever is leading the roll call that day gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: \\"Yo, Aaron!\\", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually in the form of a wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant \\"Box seats suck!\\" During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of \\"We've got beer!\\" If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant \\"Boston sucks!\\" until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting \\"No fun allowed!\\", or nothing at all. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant \\"1918!\\" and hold up signs saying \\"CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!\\" and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship. Nick Swisher salutes the Bleacher Creatures during roll call Former Yankee third baseman Scott Brosius was notorious for not responding immediately to the roll call, as other players on the diamond would. Sometimes he would even wait as long as a minute to respond, getting a kick out of the persistence of the Creatures. In Hideki Matsui's first game at the Stadium in 2003, the chant of \\"MAT-SU-I!\\" went on for approximately twenty minutes, because he did not know what was going on or how to react. In a 2009 press conference, former Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi said that \\"The biggest thing I miss is (the Bleacher Creatures') roll call. There's no doubt about it, it's the best thing in baseball.\\"  Notable exceptions  In 1999, when David Wells made his first appearance at Yankee Stadium after having been traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, his name was chanted. In his tenure with the Yankees, he was the only Yankee pitcher to be included in the Roll Call every time he pitched. Alfonso Soriano's name was chanted when he made his first appearance after being traded to the Texas Rangers. In the 2006 home opener against the Kansas City Royals, the Bleacher Creatures chanted the name of long-time Yankee outfielder Bernie Williams, who was the designated hitter that day, right after the rest of the defensive lineup. Williams, whose future in baseball was uncertain in the offseason, was in the clubhouse at the time and did not hear the Creatures. The chants continued for around 5 minutes until Williams came out and waved. At the beginning of the 2007 season opener, the Creatures started a chant of \\"We want Bernie!\\", a reference to the fact that Williams was no longer with the team. On July 16, 2010, the Bleacher Creatures elected to not do the roll call out of respect for the recent passing of both Bob Sheppard (public address announcer) and George Steinbrenner (principal owner). Michael Kay of the YES Network acknowledged this during the top of the first inning during his play-by-play details of the game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Creatures have done the call in memoriam for former players Phil Rizzuto on August 14, 2007, and Bobby Murcer at the 2008 MLB All Star Game. On May 15, 2011, the Bleacher Creatures chanted Jorge Posada's name after his recent feud with Yankee management, despite Posada not playing in the game. Posada acknowledged them from the dugout. On June 25, 2012, former Yankee center fielder Johnny Damon was greeted by a Roll Call chant when he returned to Yankee Stadium as a member of the Cleveland Indians. Damon, who played for the Yankees from 2006–09, acknowledged that he may have been the first Yankee player to answer the Bleacher Creature Roll Call with a signature pose, a tradition continued by other Yankee players, including Nick Swisher, Curtis Granderson, and Brett Gardner. On June 3, 2013, former Yankee right fielder Nick Swisher returned to Yankee Stadium and was called on roll call, even though he was now a member of the Cleveland Indians. On September 22, 2013, both Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera were included in the roll call, despite Pettitte being the starting pitcher and Rivera being a relief pitcher. On April 29, 2014, former Yankee second basemen Robinson Cano returned to Yankee Stadium and was third in the lineup for the Seattle Mariners. After being booed by the crowd at the top of the first inning, he acknowledge the roll call in the bottom of the inning, however this was followed by chants of \\"you sold out.\\" During the 2015 American League Wild Card Game, CC Sabathia was included in the roll call to support him, as he had left the team to fight his alcoholism. =The Cowbell Man= After the death of Ali Ramirez, the original Cowbell Man, the bell was given to Creature Milton Ousland. As the official \\"Cowbell Man\\", nobody else is authorized to use it, although it was agreed upon by the group that other Creatures could take over the duties when he couldn't attend. This agreement was reached due to the many fans who were disappointed that the tradition was not carried out at every game. The cowbell is primarily used to initiate a chant during a Yankees rally. After rapidly banging on the cowbell, and getting the attention of the Bleacher Creatures, Ousland plays a few notes on it, which the Creatures then imitate with claps. After repeating this several times, Ousland begins banging another few notes more rapidly, and the Creatures begin shouting \\"Oh-Ohhh!\\" in unison and moving their arms in a repetitive pointing motion. At the end, Ousland hits the cowbell three times, and the Creatures say \\"Yankee baseball. Mets suck. (visiting team) sucks. (Visiting team's right fielder) sucks. Box Seats Suck. Everybody sucks.\\" =Other chants and jeers= The Creatures also have an assortment of other chants which they use at most games. In 2001, some Creatures, led by Japanese Creature, Hiro, learned Japanese so that they could yell obscenities at former Mariners right fielder Ichiro Suzuki. Japanese curses were chanted whenever Ichiro came to town. Ichiro was traded to the Yankees in July 2012. During his first game as a Yankee he was unaware of the roll call and did not respond to the calls. Among other chants, the Creatures sometimes scream, \\"Jump!\\" at fans in the upper deck who are standing near the railing, or \\"Down in front!\\" to fans who are standing up in the section, often for a picture opportunity. At times they turn to their own members and banter with them, chanting \\"Eagles suck!\\" if one of them is a known Philadelphia Eagles fan, or \\"You sell drugs!\\". Their most famous chant besides the Roll Call is the \\"Box Seats Suck!\\" chant, which was outlawed by stadium security in 2007, but allowed back in 2009 when the Yankees moved to the new Stadium. For many years the Bleacher Creatures would pick a fan of the opposite team and during the singing of YMCA between the 6th and 7th inning and instead chant \\"Why are you gay?\\" In 2010 however, at the request of the Yankees, several key Bleacher Creatures agreed to discontinue the chant. Creatures are also known to chant \\"Asshole!\\" when there is a known Red Sox or Mets fan, or a fan of an opposing team present in the bleachers. Bobby Bonilla was affectionately called Bobby BlowMea while playing for the Baltimore Orioles in 1996. The move to Section 203 In the new stadium, the Creatures occupy Section 203 of the stadium's right field bleachers. Before the start of the 2008 MLB season, several creatures publicly expressed their anger with the move out of the old stadium. Roll Caller Vinny Milano was one of them in particular: The Yankees organization did work closely with the Creatures to ensure that they sat together again, and designated a total of 136 season-ticket packages for them in section 203. The move was monitored by long-time Creature Teena Lewis, known as the \\"Queen of the Bleachers\\", and Marc Chalpin, who organized a list of about 50+ Creatures to ensure they would all be sitting together again in the new stadium. Despite the Creatures' concerns over how the Yankees management would handle the move, Lewis said that, \\"The Yankees helped us because I calmed everybody down over the years. We behaved ourselves, took away some of the chants, and they pretty much paid us back.\\" Unlike Section 39 in the old stadium, Section 203 and the rest of the bleachers have access to the entire park. In reference to this new lack of seclusion, and the fact that beer sales are now legal in the section, New York Daily News sports columnist Filip Bondy summed up the new situation by saying, \\"At this new-fangled stadium, the golden liquid flows like soda and the walls are down that once protected the aristocracy from the bleacher proletariat. This is bound to create some class warfare down the road, some storming of the Legends suites.\\" Bondy also praised the Creatures for \\"handling the transition with commendable grace and flexibility.\\" Controversy After a too-exuberant \\"Box Seats Suck!\\" followed by an obscene gesture, Bald Vinny is about to be ejected from the Stadium by a NYPD officer. Since the inception of the Bleacher Creatures, many people have held a negative viewpoint towards the section for their notorious attitude towards opposing fans and players, and their raucous nature in general. Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporter Dan Raley called the Creatures \\"oblivious to the outside world. Demanding, relentless and venomous\\" in a 2001 article. He also claimed that \\"They have thrown batteries, coins and a knife at opposing players\\" and that \\"They throw punches at one another.\\" Longtime stadium usher Michael Swann, who used to work in Section 39 of the old stadium, also had a negative recollection of them: On occasion, one or more Creatures are asked to leave the stadium by police. The bleacher beer ban in 2000 was blamed on the Creatures, which they regard as a false accusation. They have also been accused of heckling rattled musicians in high school bands, which they do not deny. Despite all of negative attention that they receive, the Creatures have been shown in a more positive light in recent years. They have been praised for their loyalty and dedication in numerous articles and features from Filip Bondy, and in his book as well. On April 3, 2009, ABC World News Tonight did a segment on the Creatures, calling them \\"the most loyal fans any team could want.\\" When Vinny \\"Bald Vinny\\" Milano was repeatedly asked, via Twitter, whether the Creatures would still include Alex Rodriguez in the roll call around the time of his struggles and suspension in 2013, Milano insisted that A-Rod would still be part of the roll call and that no Yankee would ever be intentionally skipped.

For a visualization to be considered interactive it must satisfy two criteria: *Human input: control of some aspect of the visual representation of information, or of the information being represented, must be available to a human, and *Response time: changes made by the human must be incorporated into the visualization in a timely manner. In general, interactive visualization is considered a soft real-time task. One particular type of interactive visualization is virtual reality (VR), where the visual representation of information is presented using an immersive display device such as a stereo projector (see stereoscopy). VR is also characterized by the use of a spatial metaphor, where some aspect of the information is represented in three dimensions so that humans can explore the information as if it were present (where instead it was remote), sized appropriately (where instead it was on a much smaller or larger scale than humans can sense directly), or had shape (where instead it might be completely abstract). Another type of interactive visualization is collaborative visualization, in which multiple people interact with the same computer visualization to communicate their ideas to each other or to explore information cooperatively. Frequently, collaborative visualization is used when people are physically separated. Using several networked computers, the same visualization can be presented to each person simultaneously. The people then make annotations to the visualization as well as communicate via audio (i.e., telephone), video (i.e., a video-conference), or text (i.e., IRC) messages. Human control of visualization The Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) was one of the first programmatic efforts at interactive visualization and provided an enumeration of the types of input humans provide. People can: #Pick some part of an existing visual representation; #Locate a point of interest (which may not have an existing representation); #Stroke a path; #Choose an option from a list of options; #Valuate by inputting a number; and #Write by inputting text. All of these actions require a physical device. Input devices range from the common – keyboards, mice, graphics tablets, trackballs, and touchpads – to the esoteric – wired gloves, boom arms, and even omnidirectional treadmills. These input actions can be used to control both the information being represented or the way that the information is presented. When the information being presented is altered, the visualization is usually part of a feedback loop. For example, consider an aircraft avionics system where the pilot inputs roll, pitch, and yaw and the visualization system provides a rendering of the aircraft's new attitude. Another example would be a scientist who changes a simulation while it is running in response to a visualization (see Visulation) of its current progress. This is called computational steering. More frequently, the representation of the information is changed rather than the information itself (see Visualization (graphic)). Rapid response to human input Experiments have shown that a delay of more than 20 ms between when input is provided and a visual representation is updated is noticeable by most people . Thus it is desirable for an interactive visualization to provide a rendering based on human input within this time frame. However, when large amounts of data must be processed to create a visualization, this becomes hard or even impossible with current technology. Thus the term \\"interactive visualization\\" is usually applied to systems that provide feedback to users within several seconds of input. The term interactive framerate is often used to measure how interactive a visualization is. Framerates measure the frequency with which an image (a frame) can be generated by a visualization system. A framerate of 50 frames per second (frame/s) is considered good while 0.1 frame/s would be considered poor. The use of framerates to characterize interactivity is slightly misleading however, since framerate is a measure of bandwidth while humans are more sensitive to latency. Specifically, it is possible to achieve a good framerate of 50 frame/s but if the images generated refer to changes to the visualization that a person made more than 1 second ago, it will not feel interactive to a person. The rapid response time required for interactive visualization is a difficult constraint to meet and there are several approaches that have been explored to provide people with rapid visual feedback based on their input. Some include #Parallel rendering – where more than one computer or video card is used simultaneously to render an image. Multiple frames can be rendered at the same time by different computers and the results transferred over the network for display on a single monitor. This requires each computer to hold a copy of all the information to be rendered and increases bandwidth, but also increases latency. Also, each computer can render a different region of a single frame and send the results over a network for display. This again requires each computer to hold all of the data and can lead to a load imbalance when one computer is responsible for rendering a region of the screen with more information than other computers. Finally, each computer can render an entire frame containing a subset of the information. The resulting images plus the associated depth buffer can then be sent across the network and merged with the images from other computers. The result is a single frame containing all the information to be rendered, even though no single computer's memory held all of the information. This is called parallel depth compositing and is used when large amounts of information must be rendered interactively. #Progressive rendering – where a framerate is guaranteed by rendering some subset of the information to be presented and providing incremental (progressive) improvements to the rendering once the visualization is no longer changing. #Level-of-detail (LOD) rendering – where simplified representations of information are rendered to achieve a desired framerate while a person is providing input and then the full representation is used to generate a still image once the person is through manipulating the visualization. One common variant of LOD rendering is subsampling. When the information being represented is stored in a topologically rectangular array (as is common with digital photos, MRI scans, and finite difference simulations), a lower resolution version can easily be generated by skipping n points for each 1 point rendered. Subsampling can also be used to accelerate rendering techniques such as volume visualization that require more than twice the computations for an image twice the size. By rendering a smaller image and then scaling the image to fill the requested screen space, much less time is required to render the same data. #Frameless rendering – where the visualization is no longer presented as a time series of images, but as a single image where different regions are updated over time.

(Iceland Telecom), previously named Landssíminn, is an Icelandic telecommunications company. It offers communication services for both private and corporate clients, including mobile, home phones, Internet connections and television. Síminn also runs its own TV channel and streaming services. Síminn owns and operates companies in the information technology and infrastructure and is listed in the Icelandic stock exchange. Síminn is the leading provider of wireless communications services in Iceland, operating a 4G/3G/2G mobile network reaching over 99% of Iceland's population, including the rural areas - and offering a wide range of mobile services. In 2018, Síminn was the largest wireless carrier in Iceland with a market share of 34,5%. Ericsson is the driving force behind the company's mobile network. Speedtest by Ookla named Síminn as Iceland’s Fastest Mobile Network in 2016. History Telecommunications play a vital role in Iceland. Although the country's population is relatively small (~340,000), its penetration rates for network- related products and services are among the highest in the world. Approximately 97 percent of Iceland's households are connected to the Internet. Demand is high and continuous. =Isolation ended= The year 1906 marked a milestone in Iceland's history of telecommunications. That year, a submarine telegraph cable was laid from Scotland through the Faeroe Islands to Iceland, where it came ashore on the east coast. A telegraph and telephone line, which ended Iceland's international isolation, was laid to the capital city Reykjavík. Many years passed, however, before all Icelanders got access to the telephone system. The laying of telephone lines in rural areas was completed around 1960. The Iceland State Telephone Service was founded the same year as telephone technology arrived in Iceland, 1906. In 1935, the telephone and postal services were consolidated. In 1998, they were again separated, and the company Iceland Telecom Ltd was founded. =Automatic telephony= The people of Reykjavík were quick to adopt the telephone. In 1912, the total number of telephone users in the town was 300. In 1932, the first automatic telephone exchanges in Iceland were opened, and in 1986, all telephones in the country were connected to automatic telephone exchanges. The laying of fibreoptic cable around the country began in 1985. The first digital telephone exchanges were opened in 1984, and this technology extended to all telephone exchanges 11 years later. =Direct international dialling= Short- wave telephone communications with other countries were opened in 1935. The submarine cable, Scotice, between Scotland and Iceland was opened in 1962. In connection with the cable, telex services were established in Iceland. A year later, the Icecan cable between Iceland and Canada was formally opened. In 1980, the Skyggnir Earth Station came online, and telephone calls to other countries then went via satellite. Direct dialling to other countries became possible for the first time. In 1994, a new submarine cable, CANTAT-3, was opened. =Going mobile= Looking back in history: The NMT system went into operation in 1986, and the GSM system in 1994. In 1998, the broadband was put into operation. Iceland Telecom serves both residential and corporate clients in this small country. =Farice= A watershed in Iceland's telecommunications occurred when the FARICE submarine cable (2004), running between Iceland and Scotland via the Faeroe Islands, was brought into use. Farice hf. owner and operator of the cable as well as of the recently laid cable DANICE (2009). Iceland therefore has redundant connections via separate fibre optic cables stretching east and west across the ocean. This means more security than before when telephone and computer users had to rely on only one fibre optic cable, CANTAT-3 (now out of service), and a backup connection via satellite for all its communications with other countries. Telecommunications companies can now utilise both DANICE and FARICE-1 in parallel so that if the connection is broken on one cable, there will be no disruption of services. =IPTV= In early 2004, Iceland Telecom decided to expand its services to include Live TV and, now, Video on Demand a move to answer customers' requests for bundled television, broadband and telephony services, which would signal Iceland Telecom's entry into the world of \\"triple-play\\" (integrated telephone, television and broadband offerings). By distributing digital television content via the ADSL system, Iceland Telecom is utilising its large investment in telecommunications systems and facilitating the general build-up of the distribution system all over the country, beyond what had previously been viable. =Skjárinn= Síminn operated Skjárinn, a service provider in Iceland. The service provides a number of key local and international television services along with an on demand service providing viewers with the latest movies, sports and news. =Privatization= In July 2005, the Icelandic government privatized Landssími Íslands and sold its 98.8% share to Skipti ehf. In December 2005, three companies, Landssími Íslands, Íslenska sjónvarpsfélagið (The Icelandic Television Company) and the parent company, Skipti ehf., merged and the name was subsequently changed to Síminn hf. In March 2007 the following proposals of Siminn's board were approved: A new parent company called Skipti hf. was introduced and Síminn was split into three companies: Síminn hf. the main operating company; Fasteignafélagið Jörfi ehf, a real estate company, and Míla ehf which owns and operates the national trunk and access networks in Iceland. The new structural change took effect from 31 October 2006. Competition Póstur og sími had a monopoly on most telecommunications services until 1998. That year a new law came into effect and the market opened for competition. The first competitor was TAL, offering mobile services on reduced prices. Others followed, the biggest one being Íslandssími. In the Internet (ISP) market the competition was a lot tougher, with names like Íslandssími, Halló!, Margmiðlun, Skíma, Skrín, Snerpa, Íslandía and Miðheimar. In 2003 TAL, Íslandssími and Halló! merged under the name Og Vodafone. Og Vodafone has since then bought a few Icelandic Internet Service Providers. On October 6, 2006, Og Vodafone changed its name to Vodafone.

The term was introduced by Maskin and Tirole (1988) in a theoretical setting featuring two firms bidding sequentially and where the winner captures the full market.  Phases of a price cycle  A price cycle has the following phases: * War of attrition: When the price is at marginal cost, the firms are engaged in a war of attrition where each firm hopes that the competitor will raise her price first (\\"relent\\"). * Jump: When one firm relents, the other firm will then in the next period undercut, which is when the market price jumps. This first period is the most valuable to be the low- price firm, which is what causes firms to want to stay in the war of attrition to force the competitor to jump first. * Undercutting: then follows a sequence where the firms take turns at undercutting each other until the market arrives back in the war of attrition at the low price.  Discussion  It can be debated whether Edgeworth Cycles should be thought of as tacit collusion because it is a Markov Perfect equilibrium, but Maskin and Tirole write: \\"Thus our model can be viewed as a theory of tacit collusion.\\" (p. 592). Edgeworth cycles have been reported in gasoline markets in many countries. Because the cycles tend to occur frequently, weekly average prices found in government reports will generally mask the cycling. Wang (2012) emphasizes the role of price commitment in facilitating price cycles: without price commitment, the dynamic game becomes one of simultaneous move and here, the cycles are no longer a Markov Perfect equilibrium but rely on, e.g., supergame arguments. Edgeworth cycles are distinguished from both sticky pricing and cost-based pricing. Sticky prices are typically found in markets with less aggressive price competition, so there are fewer or no cycles. Purely cost-based pricing occurs when retailers mark up from wholesale costs, so costs follow wholesale variations closely.  Alternative models of price cycles  There is a separate literature, which has explored conditions under which price cycles like the ones observed gasoline markets and found that consumer search models can rationalize cycling under various conditions. Here, the intuition is that there is a small subset of consumers that are not informed about prices and therefore will buy from a firm regardless of the price charged. Once prices get low enough, a firm may find it optimal to charge a high price and exploit this small loyal segment rather than trying to win the whole market.

CHSC broadcast both daytime and nighttime with a radiated power of 10,000 watts at 1220 kHz AM. The signal pushed mainly north and west, but was on a reduced pattern in both easterly and southerly directions due to interference with a co-channel station in Cleveland (WHKW) and with AM 1230 WECK (Cheektowaga), forty miles to the east. CHSC could routinely be heard as far north as parts of cottage country and west beyond Guelph. CHSC aired a mix of adult contemporary, oldies along with a bit of country typically attracting audiences ages 30 and up, both male and female. CHSC played a mix of 50 per cent gold and 50 per cent current/recurrent of which 45 per cent on average consisted of Canadian content during the broadcast week of Sunday to Saturday. Listeners could also find interviews in both the English and Italian. The station's regular English programming was branded as 1220 CHSC, and its Italian programming was branded as Radio Uno. On July 30, 2010, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denied the station's application for renewal.CRTC Decision 2010-533. As of 2011, the station now broadcasts a full-time Italian language format via Internet streaming and marketed toward the Greater Toronto Area, but has not been licensed to relaunch on the AM band. As of 2020, the internet streaming is no longer functional. History CHSC was launched in 1967 by Radio Station CHSC Ltd., which also launched CHSC-FM at the same time. The station was acquired by Coultis Broadcasting in 1990.Decision CRTC 90-229 In 1997, the station entered into a local marketing agreement with CJRN and CKEY in Niagara Falls. The station subsequently applied to move to FM in 2001, but withdrew the application.Notice of Public Hearing CRTC 2001-7-3 Coultis went into receivership in 2002, and the station was acquired by Pellpropco Inc.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-155 Programming In later years, CHSC's program schedule consisted of English and Italian-language spoken word and music programming. English-language programming ran during the week, interspersed with Italian-language music in the afternoons. 1220 CHSC was one of the last AM stations remaining in Canada that played current charted music. The music was 50% gold and 50% current-recurrent with above the average Canadian content required. The CRTC only required CHSC to play 35 per cent Canadian content over the course of the broadcast week (Sunday to Saturday) but CHSC averaged about 45% during the broadcast week. Spoken word programming consisted largely of news updates at the top of each hour from 6 a.m. till 6 p.m. on weekdays, and the It's Your Call Sports Show on Monday nights. Italian-language programming branded as Radio Uno began at 9am Saturdays and ran right through till 6am Monday morning when programming reverted to English. CHSC also experimented with other third-language programming. During about three months of 2008 South-Asian Dhoom (Hindu music and chat) aired weekdays in the last couple of hours before noon and at the supper hour for about three hours. Caribbean Connection, a mix of soca music and English- language chat aired on Saturdays and Sundays during the supper hour for three hours on Saturday and two hours on Sunday. Both South-Asian Dhoom and Caribbean Connection were eventually cancelled. 2008 problems In the summer 2008, the Queenston Street building, which housed CHSC's studio and offices since its founding, were seized by bailiffs and all of the contents were auctioned off. This was allegedly due either to large sums of unpaid rent and taxes; to physical deterioration, according to documents filed by the station owner with the CRTC; or both. The CRTC announced a January 2009 hearing to inquire into format violations, missing financial statements, logger tapes, the loss of the studio, and the station's allegedly being operated from Woodbridge, a suburb of Toronto, rather than St. Catharines. CHSC's web site is a mere welcome message and a link to the online streaming.Broadcasting Notice of Public Hearing CRTC 2008-14 On June 30, 2009, the CRTC issued a number of mandatory orders to Pellpropco regarding the management of the station.CRTC Decision 2009-391 2010 shutdown On July 30, 2010, the CRTC issued a decision that it would not renew the station's license, requiring the station to cease broadcasting at the end of the broadcast day of August 31. The CRTC cited numerous failures to comply with regulations and with commission orders, and the doubtfulness of the station management's promises to comply in the future. According to CRTC media relations, Pellpropco filed a motion on August 25 with the Federal Court of Canada, and a stay was issued on August 31. This allowed CHSC to remain on the air, legally, pending a decision by that court. CHSC was noted on-air the afternoon of September 1 with regular programming (Radio Uno at that time). The court declined to allow an appeal on September 30, effectively putting an end to the station for good; by October 2, CHSC was off the air. In January 2015, the former CHSC studios at 36 Queenston Street in St. Catharines was demolished; its land will be used for a four-storey apartment building.CHSC's fortunes face final crumble , St. Catharines Standard, January 14, 2015 2012: Rejected application for 1220 On July 10, 2012, 8045313 Canada Inc. (a numbered company unrelated to Pellpropco Inc.) applied for a new radio station which would broadcast a music format that would consist of a mix of past, present and emerging artists. If it had been approved, the new station would have operated at 1220 kHz (AM), the former frequency used by CHSC until its shutdown in late 2010.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2012-370, CRTC, July 10, 2012 The application was denied by the CRTC on January 30, 2013.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-29, English-language AM radio station in St. Catharines (denied), CRTC, January 30, 2013 2015: New application for 1220 On October 21, 2015, Sivanesarajah Kandiah submitted an application for 1220 kHz, which would operate with 10,000 watts full-time and will utilize the transmitting equipment previously used by CHSC.

Menster (February 10, 1913 – April 14, 2007) was a Roman Catholic priest of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Menster was best known as the first member of the clergy to visit Antarctica. Biography Born in Cascade, Iowa, Menster was the son of Joseph and Frances Menster. He attended St. Martin's School in Cascade and Loras College in Dubuque. Menster studied for the priesthood at St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio. Menster was ordained a priest on June 11, 1938. Fr. Menster was then assigned to be the associate pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Waterloo, Iowa. During this time Menster joined the United States Naval Reserve, and by 1943 had reached the rank of lieutenant commander. Following the Second World War, in 1946 Menster was assigned to Operation Highjump – Admiral Richard Byrd's fourth expedition to Antarctica. He was assigned to the USS Mt. Olympus, and was the only chaplain in the five ship fleet. In 1947 he became the first Catholic priest ever to set foot on Antarctica, and led the first ever religious service on the continent. During a religious service held in a tent set up on land, he consecrated Antarctica. Ministering to 2,000 men of a variety of religious faiths gave him experience in leading ecumenical services. After returning to the United States in 1947, Menster was assigned to Saint Mary's Church in Corwith, Iowa. Menster was named the director of Catholic Charities in 1948, and held this posting until 1958. He wrote the book Strong Men South as a chronicle of his adventures in 1949. He later traveled to Hollywood where he served as a technical consultant when ABC made a documentary about Antarctica named \\"The Secret Land\\" - which was based in part on his book. In 1950 Menster and his father were granted a private audience with Pope Pius XII. Menster was assigned to be the pastor of St. Patrick's Church in, Monona, St. Mary's in Waverly, and St. John's in Clarion in 1958. Menster was named the pastor of the St. Donatus parish in 1978. After the expedition he continued his career in the navy. During this time he became involved in veteran's work, and served as the national chaplain of the AMVETS organization. After 25 years of service Menster retired as a full Commander. Menster retired from active ministry, and was living in Dubuque at the time of his death. At the time of his death, Menster was the oldest living priest in the Archdiocese of Dubuque.

The street was named in honor of King Charles III John, who was also King of Sweden as Charles XIV John.Karl Johans Gate (Oslo-Norway.ca) Karl Johans gate is a composite of several older streets that used to be separate thoroughfares. The eastern section was part of Christian IV's original city near the ramparts surrounding the city. When the ramparts were removed to make way for Oslo Cathedral, three separate sections eventually became Østre Gade.kut The wider western section was built during the 1840s as an avenue connecting the newly erected Norwegian Royal Palace with the rest of the city. In 1852, it was named Karl Johans gate in honor of the recently deceased king. His equestrian statue, by sculptor Brynjulf Bergslien, was later erected during 1875 in front of the Royal Palace. When the Norwegian parliament building was completed in 1866 at the junction of the two formerly separate streets, the two streets were joined and the whole length was named Karl Johans gate.Karl Johans gate (Store norske leksikon) Karl Johans gate in the 1890s In its current route, it connects Oslo Central Station, the main railroad station in Oslo, and the Royal Palace. The route changes its direction and width slightly halfway between these two points, at Egertorget, a square at the intersection of Karl Johans gate and Øvre Slottsgate. This is the highest point and, here, both ends of the street may be seen. The street is 1,020 metres long; in addition there are 300 metres of direct extensions, Palace Hill (Slottsbakken) and Palace Place (Slottsplassen). The street includes many of Oslo's tourist attractions: In addition to the Royal Palace, Central Station and Stortinget, there are the National Theatre, the old University Buildings, the Palace Park and the pond (\\"Spikersuppa\\") at Eidsvolls plass, which serves as a skating rink in winter. Oslo Cathedral's lower end is surrounded by the Bazaar Market (Basarene ved Oslo domkirke), which is integrated with the historic Fire Watch (Brannvakta) that served as Oslo's main fire station from 1860 until 1939.

He played with and influenced some of South Africa's great musicians, including Jonas Gwangwa, Abdullah Ibrahim, Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela. Biography Born into a musical Johannesburg family, Jeremiah Morolong Moeketsi was the youngest of 11 brothers, and one sister who was a nurse (Mirriam Ntsadi Kathar, née Moeketsi), all but four of whom played an instrument. Growing up in George Goch township was unpleasant for him and he was often truant. According to the Johannesburg official website, \\"His mother used to go looking for him, shouting: 'kippie-kippie- kippie', as if he were a chicken\\" — hence his nickname. At 20 he started playing clarinet, but would soon move on to the saxophone. Influenced by his pianist brother Jacob Moeketsi, Kippie's career began playing in shebeens with his group, known as the Band in Blue. Over the years he played with several bands, including Shantytown Sextet, the Harlem Swingsters and famously the Jazz Epistles that brought fame to him, Abdullah Ibrahim (or Dollar Brand as he was known then), Jonas Gwangwa, and Hugh Masekela.

The character was created by Dan Jurgens and Tom Grummett and first appears in Thor Annual 2001. The character has been succeeded in his role as a killer of gods by the character Gorr the God Butcher, a more brutal character with a similar mission to kill gods, though the two are unrelated beyond this. Fictional character history Desak comes from an unnamed world where the inhabitants worship a god called Kronnitt. Kronnitt demands the sacrifice of Desak's daughter, and it was during the sacrifice that an apparition visits Desak and offers him a magic gem that will save his daughter. Desak thinks he is hallucinating, and refuses. When Kronnitt punishes Desak's people—despite the sacrifice—the apparition returns and this time Desak accepts the gem. Empowered by the gem, and equipped with a huge sword, axe, dagger and shield, Desak then confronts and kills Kronnitt. His course of action clear, Desak travels from world to world and slays pantheon after pantheon of gods. It is during a hunt for two gods called Pennsu and Tae, Desak encounters Thor, Beta Ray Bill, and Hercules. When Pennsu and Tae attempt to destroy their own people the heroes intervene, giving Desak time to slay them both. After a terse verbal encounter with Thor, Desak departs.Thor Annual 2001 Desak eventually slaughters almost all of the Dark Gods—the Asgardians' old enemies—with the exception of Perrikus and Adva, who escape.Thor vol. 2, #41 (Nov. 2001) Desak is then contacted by Zarrko the Tomorrow Man, who warns him of the threat that Thor, now Lord of Asgard after the death of Odin, poses to Earth. After easily dispatching the villain Grey Gargoyle, Desak fights and almost kills Thor. Having absorbed the Odinforce after a futile attack by Thor, Desak is about to kill Thor when a fellow Asgardian, Thialfi, provides Thor with the Bloodaxe, which Thor uses to kill Desak.Thor vol. 2, 47 - 50 (May - Aug. 2002) Unknown to Thor, the apparition rescues Desak and allows him to heal in hiding. Desak returns many years after a changed Thor has conquered the Earth, and kills many of Thor's closest Asgardian comrades. It is at this moment that the apparition is revealed to be Tarene, the Designate, who had traveled back in time to try to stop the future from occurring. Merging with the Destroyer, Desak becomes even more powerful, but now faces an enlightened Thor who realizes that his actions were wrong. Thor hurls his hammer Mjolnir with such force that it completely decapitates the Destroyer, killing Desak instantly.Thor vol. 2, 75 - 79 (May - July 2004) Powers and abilities Desak possessed superhuman strength, endurance, and his stone-like skin provided him with an extremely high resistance to injury. Desak had the ability to fly, teleport, shoot energy beams from his eyes, and survive indefinitely in the void of space. He could sense all aspects of godliness, including immortality, in an individual, and he was given power equal to any god. With his Amulet of Power, he could also absorb their life force into the gem, adding the defeated god's power to his own. It had not been revealed to what limit the amount of power Desak could attain. However, Desak had destroyed whole populations of gods single-handedly.

Broadcasting at 610 AM, the station airs a news/talk format. CKTB is housed in the former mansion of William Hamilton Merritt, the main promoter of the first Welland Canal, located on Yates Street in downtown St. Catharines. Its transmitters are located on Grassy Brook Road east of Port Robinson.http://radio- locator.com/info/CKTB-AM CKTB was launched in 1930 by Edward T. Sandell at 1120 on the AM dial, as a phantom station of CKOC in Hamilton.https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/radio/cktb- am As with most early AM radio stations (see Canadian allocations changes under NARBA), the station changed frequencies a number of times in its early years, moving to 1200 in 1933, 1230 in 1941, 1550 in 1946, 620 in 1950 and its current 610 in 1959. In 1936, the station became a founding affiliate of CBC Radio and in 1944, affiliated with CBC's Dominion Network. The affiliation remained until the Dominion Network was dissolved in 1962. Sandell died in 1943, and the station was acquired by Niagara District Broadcasting the following year. Niagara District Broadcasting subsequently launched CKTB-FM in 1949. The stations were acquired by Standard Broadcasting in 1980. Standard sold CKTB to Affinity Radio Group in 1997. Affinity was in turn acquired by Telemedia in 2000; Standard reacquired the station when it purchased Telemedia in 2002. In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CKTB. Ownership changed hands again in July 2013 when most of Astral Media's broadcasting properties including CKTB were sold to Bell Media, a subsidiary of Bell Canada. Programming CKTB's programming is a mixture of locally produced Canadian programming and American syndicated programs, owing to St. Catharines's position halfway between the cities of Hamilton, Ontario and Buffalo, New York. As of February 2020, local weekday hosts include Tim Denis, Shelby Knox and Tom McConnell. Weekend local programming consists of a morning show hosted by married hosts Carol and Paul Mott which is syndicated on 610 AM and 1010 CFRB. Past hosts of locally produced programming include Joe Cahill, Kevin Jack, Stephanie Sabourin, Rob McConnell, Larry Fedoruk, Chris Biggs and John Michael. CKTB was the only affiliate in Canada to carry the controversial The Phil Hendrie Show until 2006, when Phil Hendrie retired for the first time. CKTB continued to air the best of Phil Hendrie on Saturdays from 6-10p.m. until April 2007. At that point, the show was replaced with other programming (including part of the previous night's Coast to Coast AM broadcast). With Hendrie's return to radio, however, CKTB returned him to the lineup on a daily basis. The show, however, was subsequently dropped and replaced by Joy Browne, another American show. Browne's program was also subsequently dropped in favour of two-hour-long 'best of' programming blocks, edited from the day's local programming.http://www.610cktb.com/shows.aspx CKTB carries broadcasts of the Niagara IceDogs junior hockey team and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the NHL, along with select programming simulcast with sister station CKOC in Hamilton (such as Hamilton Tiger-Cats games). Until 2005, CKTB had carried sports programming from the Buffalo Bills of the NFL and the NHL's Buffalo Sabres. In that year, CKTB dropped Bills coverage, while the Sabres rights were revoked as Entercom Communications, owners of WGR in Buffalo and WROC in Rochester, New York, gained exclusive rights to the team's games. While St. Catharines is usually considered a part of the Buffalo market when dealing with syndicated programming, CKTB does not usually show up in Buffalo's Arbitron ratings. A lack of knowledge of the station, its distance from Buffalo (coupled with its presence on the AM dial), and its primarily Canadian content during the day contribute to this. However, BBM registers CKTB as a popular station in the St. Catharines market, with audience share comparable to that of CHML's audience share in nearby Hamilton.BBM Topline Radio Report , Fall 2007 References External links * CKTB * CKTB history - Canadian Communications Foundation * Ktb Ktb Ktb Category:Radio stations established in 1930 Category:1930 establishments in Ontario KTB ","title":"CKTB"},{"id":"3601167","text":"In My Mind may refer to: Films * In My Mind – documentary about Patrick McGoohan and the making of The Prisoner TV series Music = Albums = * In My Mind (BJ the Chicago Kid album) * In My Mind (Heather Headley album) * In My Mind (Pharrell Williams album) * In My Mind 1997–2007 the Best of Bertine Zetlitz * In My Mind (Is a Different World – A Cheeky One), 2007 album by The Cheeky Girls = Songs = * \\"In My Mind\\" (Antiloop song), 1997 * \\"In My Mind\\" (Heather Headley song), 2005 * \\"In My Mind\\" (Maty Noyes song), 2016 * \\"In My Mind\\" (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song), a song by Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl featuring Georgi Kay (best known for its remix by Axwell) * \\"In My Mind\\" (Dynoro and Gigi D'Agostino song), 2018 * \\"In My Mind\\", a song by Amanda Palmer from the album Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under. * \\"In My Mind\\" (Prismo song), 2017 ","title":"In My Mind"},{"id":"3601188","text":"TED Kayseri Koleji was founded in 1966 in order enable all the children in Turkey to benefit from the equal and high quality education opportunities.

He was a dominant figure in Norwegian architecture in the first half of the 1800s. Christian Heinrich Grosch (Store norske leksikon) Arkitekter: Christian Heinrich Grosch (artemisia.no) Biography Christian Heinrich Grosch was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. His family moved to Frederikshald (now Halden) in Østfold, Norway during 1811. He was first educated by his father, Heinrich August Grosch (1763-1843) who was a painter, graphic designer and teacher. When The Royal Drawing School was established in Christiania (now Oslo) in 1818, his father gained employment there as an instructor and re-located the family. Christian Heinrich attended the Royal Drawing School from 1819 to 1820. He also studied engineering with instructors including Benoni Aubert and Theodor Broch. In 1824, he completed his training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen.

Kurtzman became the University of Pittsburgh's Vice Chancellor for Finance in July of 1965, \\"at the height of a financial crisis at the University.\\" He was appointed Acting Chancellor after Stanton Crawford's sudden death of a heart attack seven months later, on January 26, 1966. Kurtzman's administration negotiated the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's bailout of Pitt's fiscal woes, through which the university became a state- related institution on August 23, 1966. According to his obituary ten years later, after the bailout, as the university continued its search for a permanent chancellor, \\"trustees were heard to say 'If Dave Kurtzman were 10 years younger, we might not be looking.' Then 63, Dr. Kurtzman was two years short of the mandatory retirement age.\\" On January 13, 1967, the Board of Trustees announced its selection of Wesley Posvar as its new Chancellor, effective June 1, and promoted Kurtzman to the full rank of Chancellor until then, and Chancellor Emeritus afterward. A ballroom in the university's William Pitt Union is named in his honor. Kurtzman was born near Odessa, Ukraine, in then-czarist Russia, and survived pogroms as a boy, eventually immigrating to the United States in 1921. Although he did not start high school until age 19, he finished in under two years, then earned an undergraduate degree in accounting from Temple University and an M.A. and a Ph.D. in political science at the University of Pennsylvania. He worked for many years at the Pennsylvania Economy League. There he served as a key aide to David L. Lawrence, mayor of Pittsburgh, and Richard King Mellon, financier, in their effort to build the city's first renaissance after World War II. Kurtzman joined the newly elected Governor Lawrence in 1959 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania as his secretary of administration. After his time at Pitt, Kurtzman returned to Harrisburg in 1967 as State Superintendent of Public Instruction (later Secretary of Education) under Governors Raymond P. Shafer and Milton Shapp; in this role he became the named respondent in the landmark US Supreme Court decision Lemon v. Kurtzman.

The DUAT Service was a telephone- and Internet-based system which allowed the pilot to use a personal computer for access to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) database to obtain weather and aeronautical information and to file, amend, and cancel domestic IFR and VFR flight plans. DUATS provided direct access to weather information via a National Airspace System (NAS) Data Interchange Network II (NADIN-II) interface to the Weather Message Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) System and the Air traffic control (ATC) Facilities for filing flight plans. The pilot users could interface DUAT Services via the FTS-2001 toll free telephone numbers or via an Internet Interface into the Contractor's Facility. The service could be accessed by direct dial (using a terminal emulator like HyperTerminal), and the Internet via Telnet or HTTP. The last DUATS service contractor was CSRA, formerly known as Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). Some commonly used services that DUATS provided were flight planning, flight plan filing and closing, and retrieving aviation weather, both alphanumeric and graphic, and NOTAM information, although the full list was much longer. DUATS was available free of charge to all registered U.S. pilots and student pilots who hold a current medical certificate, as well as flight instructors, ground instructors, glider and balloon pilots, and other members of the aviation community.

The duats.com website is defunct, the domain name now owned by a promotional service. DUATS Functions =Flight Restrictions= DUATS could display Temporary Flight Restrictions in both textual and graphical format. =Weather Briefings= DUATS provided complete standard, outlook, or abbreviated weather briefings. These briefings were the same quality as, and could substitute for, those received from a Flight Service Station. Standard briefings are used when a flight is expected to take place within 8 hours, and include all weather and NOTAM information applicable for that flight. Outlook briefings are applicable when a flight is planned for more than 8 hours in the future, and includes expected weather conditions at that time. Abbreviated briefings could be requested when a standard briefing had already been received and a pilot only needs to know if there have been any changes or updates. =Weather Graphics= DUATS offered weather graphics including surface analyses, satellite imagery, NEXRAD radar, and forecasts up to 72 hours into the future. =Flight Planner= One of DUATS most-used features was its flight planning system. Designed for ease of use, the flight planner required only six inputs (departure airport, destination airport, cruise altitude, aircraft profile, route of aircraft, and departure time) to calculate a complete navigation log. The navigation log included: *Route *Forecast winds *Temperatures *Airspeed (ground speed and true airspeed) *Fuel consumption *Time en route *Distance between checkpoints Example of a simple DUATS navigation log \\\\---+--------+---------+----- ------ 1\\\\. Waypoint 1   Waypoint location --------+----+---+------ Latitude Longitude Alt  Route Fuel  \\\\---+--------+---------+----- Winds Crs TAS Time ------ 2\\\\. Waypoint 2  Temp Hdg GS Dist  Waypoint location --------+----+---+------ Latitude Longitude Alt   \\\\---+--------+---------+----- ------ =Airport Diagrams= Downloadable airport diagrams were available via a link from the main DUATS page. =Stored Aircraft Profiles= DUATS could store data on a particular type of airplane that the user generally flies so it could be used for flight planning purposes. =Flight Plan Filing= Once a flight plan was entered, it could be sent directly into the FAA flight plan database using DUATS. After a VFR flight was completed, DUATS could also be used to report the flight plan as closed to the FAA. =Stored Routes= A flight plan could be entered and then stored to be flown later. =Encode and Decode Contractions= DUATS could display the identifier for an airport or navaid given the name, and the name given the identifier. It could also take a standard contraction and give the plain English definition. =Profile= DUATS could also store required information about a pilot and then enter it automatically when filing a flight plan.

Saika-ikki was formed by several peasant and noble people. Their unnamed men and women informants were said to have been called \\"Magoichi\\" by their clients. In particular, the members of the Saika ikki, along with the monks of the Negoro-ji, were renowned for their expertise with the arquebus and for their expert gunsmiths and foundries. Both of these groups came to the aid of the Ishiyama Hongan-ji, the central fortress-cathedral of the ikkō-ikki that was besieged by Oda Nobunaga from 1570–80. The town motto is translated to English as \\"stand strong and do not forget\\". Their own fortress, Ōta Castle (near the site of present-day Wakayama Castle), was besieged by Nobunaga in 1577. The monastery was attacked again in 1585 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in chastisement for their opposition to his former lord, Oda. References Additional Reading *Turnbull, Stephen (2003).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 18, 1993. After getting arrested for drunk driving, Homer tries to remain sober, at Marge's request. Meanwhile, Lisa attempts to prove that Bart is less intelligent than a hamster after he ruins her first science fair project. The episode was written by David M. Stern, and directed by Jim Reardon. The episode had a positive reception. Plot While having breakfast with her family, Lisa shows them her project for an upcoming science fair, a steroid- enhanced tomato she hopes will cure world hunger. At school, three days before the fair, Lisa leaves her tomato under Bart's care for a moment and he hurls it at Skinner's butt. When Lisa returns, she is furious. She asks Marge for help, who suggests she run a hamster through a maze. Lisa likes the idea, but instead pits a hamster against Bart to find out who is smarter. After two easy tests, the hamster leads two to zero. Bart later discovers her plans to humiliate him at the fair and pre-empts them with a project of his own, \\"Can hamsters fly planes?\\", showing her hamster in the cockpit on a miniature plane. Despite Lisa's objection concerning the lack of scientific merit, everyone is distracted by how cute the hamster is, and Principal Skinner is proud and hands Bart the winning ribbon. Meanwhile, Homer sneaks out early at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and accompanies Barney on a tour of the Duff brewery. Afterward, Homer refuses to let an extremely drunk Barney drive home and forces him to hand over his keys. On their way out of the parking lot, their car is pulled over by police Chief Wiggum, along with Eddie and Lou. They administer a breathalyser test to Homer, which he fails. He is arrested, loses his license, and must attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In bed, Marge gives Homer a magazine quiz about his drinking. Hearing Homer's answers, Marge asks him to give up beer for a month, to which he agrees despite several incidents of temptations. Homer flees the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting when Reverend Lovejoy assures him he would never drink again after it ends, but exhibits more positive changes like losing weight, saving over $100 and not sweating while eating. After thirty days of sobriety, Homer goes back to Moe's for a beer, but leaves after seeing how alcohol has ruined the lives of Barney and the other barflies. He and Marge ride a bike into the sunset singing Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head. Production Bart's go-go ray idea was \\"stolen\\" from the opening credits of Johnny Quest. Mike Reiss said they did not want to show the hamster getting shocked but had to for plot purposes. The first line Richard Nixon says, during the Duff commercial, was taken verbatim from the Kennedy-Nixon Debate during the 1960 Presidential Campaign. Adolf Hitler's head, among other things, can be seen going by in bottles of Duff when the quality control man is not paying attention. The Troy McClure driver's education film title Alice's Adventures Through the Windshield Glass was pitched by Frank Mula. The episode contains the first appearance of Sarah Wiggum.Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for \\"Duffless\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The episode also contains a two-second snippet of footage from \\"Bart the Daredevil\\": a close-up of Homer making a disappointed face and saying \\"D'oh!\\" when he gets arrested. Cultural references Queen when he bought his first beer. When Bart reaches for the cupcakes and collapses, it is a parody of a scene in A Clockwork Orange, where the main character Alex reaches for a woman's breasts. The Duff clock is a parody of the \\"It's a Small World\\" clock. In the Duff TV advertisement, a group of women were leading an anti-sexism protest in front of the McMahon and Tate building, a reference to the advertising agency from Bewitched. The scene toward the end where Moe points toward individual customers declaring they will \\"be back\\" before pointing toward and addressing the viewer (later revealed to be Barney via a cutaway) is a parody of the end of the film Reefer Madness. The final scene, where Homer and Marge cycle into the distance while \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\\" plays is a reference to the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Homer's song \\"It was a Very Good Beer\\" is sung to the tune of the 1961 song \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\"; one of its lyrics is Homer stating he stayed up and listened to the music of the British band Queen. Bart sitting in the chair, stroking the hamster is a reference to James Bond character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who strokes a cat in his chair. Lisa imagines Bart as a hamster trapped in a maze saying \\"Help me! Help me!\\" which is a reference to The Fly. Reception \\"Duffless\\" aired during February sweeps and finished 19th in the weekly ratings for the week of February 15–21, 1993 with a Nielsen rating of 15.2 and was viewed in 14.2 million homes. It was the highest rated show from the Fox Network that week. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said, \\"A superb episode with a sincere message. Homer is excellent throughout, but it is the cameos by Principal Skinner and Edna Krabappel that steal the show, especially the latter's reaction to Milhouse's Slinky.\\" Entertainment Weekly ranked the episode as number eleven on their list of the top twenty-five The Simpsons episodes.

Tibetan Thanka depicting peaceful deities, 19th century, Giumet Museum. At the center is primordial Buddha Samantabhadra.

Pal Gyutrül Drawa Sangwé Nyingpo De Kona Nyid Ngé Pa, Wyl. dpal sgyu 'phrul drva ba gsang ba'i snying po de kho na nyid nges pa). It is also often The Tantra of the Web of Magical Illusion (Tib. Gyutrül Drawa Gyü, Wyl. sgyu 'phrul drva ba rgyud). The Nyingma school holds that Garab Dorje received the empowerment and transmission of the Mahayoga teachings of the Guhyagarbha from the indian Mahasiddha Kukuraja.Dharma Fellowship (2005). Biographies: Pramodavajra, Regent of the Divine. Source: (accessed: November 15, 2007) The Secret Womb actually refers to a collection of nineteen texts in the Tibetan canon. The main works include a short version in twenty-two chapters, an intermediate version (forty-six chapters) and a long version (eighty two chapters). These texts describe a mandala of forty- two peaceful deities and fifty-eight fierce deities. According to John Powers, its central teaching \\"holds that all things manifest spontaneously (thams cad rang snang), and mind and primordial wisdom also manifest spontaneously (sems dang ye shes rang snang).\\" The Secret Womb texts discuss numerous tantric Buddhist topics, such as the creation of mandalas, the practice of controlling the winds and drops within energy channels, the purification of the five aggregates, and the qualities and activities of the Buddhas. Tibetan interpreters generally see the Secret Womb Tantra as a guide to the Buddhist practice of Mahayoga, which also termed deity yoga, which is a tantric method of realizing the true nature of reality and attaining Buddhahood. This method mainly relies on the imagination to create a Buddha image in one's mind during a tantric ritual and then to merge this Buddha with oneself. According to Gyurme Dorje: > \\"The iconography and symbolism of the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities > presented in the Guhyagarbha Tantra subsequently gave rise to a whole genre > of literature in Tibet known as the Cycles of the Peaceful and Wrathful > Deities (zhi-khro).\\"Gyurme Dorje, A Brief Literary History of the Tibetan > Book of the Dead in \\"Graham Coleman, Thupten Jinpa.

Since the late 1950s, nav/attack systems helped pilots increase the accuracy of releasing ordnance. A computer program would record the aircraft's velocity and use it to pinpoint their location in relationship with the target's location. Early integrated nav/attack systems suffered from poor reliability. Improvements in digital computing technology, advent of the microchip, have resulted in substantially more sophisticated and effective equipment. A typical modern nav/attack system is based around an inertial navigation system (INS) that allows the aircrew to locate the target area without relying on active sensors such as radar that might alert enemy combatants. INS can help calculate \\"drift\\", changes in course that deviate from the target, the nav/attack system can guide the aircraft to the target or be used as a tool to help guide the pilot to the target. Modern systems typically provide an automatic weapons release; the aircraft can be programmed to release the ordnance before it misses the target. The aircraft's computer system will release the ordnance unless the pilot chooses to override that command and release it instead. The navigation program accounts for factors such as wind and velocity. Early nav/attack systems were primitive but paved the way for the systems we have today. Today's systems give pilots deadlier accuracy because of technological advances that have developed since the first model.

Benny and Björn have stated that the song sounded 'wrong': the verse and chorus did not fit together, and that is why it was scrapped. The two men admit this happens regularly in their way of writing music: a mediocre song can become a bridge or a riff for another song, and a good melody line can lie around for many years until it surfaces in a composition. Benny and Björn nevertheless allowed for a 'snippet' of \\"Just Like That\\" to be released in a 'medley' track on the box set Thank You for the Music in 1994. Although this snippet only revealed the chorus of the track, it is notable for featuring a saxophone solo by Raphael Ravenscroft, perhaps best known for his famous saxophone riff on Gerry Rafferty's 1978 hit \\"Baker Street\\". This was one of the very few times that ABBA used a musician outside the usual ABBA circle. Other recordings of \\"Just Like That\\" exist; a version features a guitar riff that eventually made its way into the verse melody of the song \\"Under Attack\\" (\\"Don't know how to take it/don't know where to go/my resistance running low...\\"),Palm, Carl Magnus: ABBA - The Complete Recordings Sessions, page 119. Verulam Publishing Ltd (October 13, 1994). . . while another interpretation has come to be known as the 'na na na' (or 'la la la') version, where Agnetha is heard singing 'na na na na's on top of the instrumental melody. In 1994, Agnetha had discussed the song: \\"I haven't heard it in several years, but I remember it as a very good song and recording. It is one of my big favourites, and I hope it's going to be released one day\\".Palm, Carl Magnus: ABBA - The Complete Recordings Sessions, page 118. Verulam Publishing Ltd (October 13, 1994). . . In 1985, a new version of \\"Just Like That\\" (but which kept the original chorus) was recorded by Swedish duo Gemini, who performed the song live in the UK (with Benny playing the synthesizer) on Terry Wogan's chat show.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTHaFehj3zw Gemini: Just Like That. Retrieved March 17, 2018. It was later released as a single. \\"Just Like That\\" was originally intended to be featured in the ABBA musical, Mamma Mia!, sung as a love duet between Sophie and Sky, but was removed during rehearsals, as it apparently did not advance the story.Andersson, Benny; Ulvaeus, Bjorn; and Craymer, Judy (2006), \\"Mamma Mia! How Can I Resist You? - The Inside Story of Mamma Mia and the Songs of ABBA\\", Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, p.148 =Dream World= \\"Dream World\\" (working title: \\"Dream Land\\") is a song recorded in September 1978 with shared vocals by Agnetha and Frida (with the solo passage by Agnetha). The song was recorded during sessions for the album Voulez-Vous. However, composers Benny and Björn ultimately decided that \\"Dream World\\" was not suitable for release, and instead agreed to scrap the recording. The melody and chord sequence of the middle-eight of \\"Dream World\\" were re-used, with different lyrics, as the bridge for the middle-eight of the song \\"Does Your Mother Know\\", later released as the second single from Voulez- Vous. In the 1980s, the song was heard for the first time in a Swedish radio programme featuring ABBA's engineer Michael B. Tretow, and subsequently found its way onto a bootleg album. In 1994, \\"Dream World\\" was released in Sweden, Germany and Australia as a promotional-only CD-single with other ABBA rarities to advertise the Thank You for the Music box set, which also contained the track. The version of the song released in 1994 differs from the version heard in the radio show in that its fairground-like synthesiser introduction fades in rather than starting abruptly. However, this is because the tape from which the track was taken was partly destroyed. The \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of the Voulez- Vous album (released in May 2010), contains the track with its original beginning. It is unknown how the full introduction was resurrected from the partially destroyed tape. It was reported just before its 1994 release that Benny and Björn were in the studio remixing the track, and hence it is most probably a new mix-down of the song done expressly in 1994. Indeed, it exhibits a certain \\"digital\\" sound suggesting it was mixed down to a digital recorder as opposed to previously released songs from this period which were mixed onto analog tape. \\"Dream World\\" was included in full form (without the fade-in) for the first time on the Voulez-Vous Deluxe Edition CD/DVD package, released on May 31, 2010.

His unique method made him one of the most well-known and influential trombone educators in history. He was a member of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra from 1923 to 1949, and on the faculty of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY from 1922 until his death in 1971. Emory Remington Early life Born in Rochester, New York on December 22, 1892, Emory Remington began his musical studies in the Boys' Choir of an Episcopal Church. His Father, Fred Remington, a brass instructor who played cornet and trumpet, presented young Emory with a trombone at the age of 14. By the age of 17 he was a member (and regular soloist) with the Rochester Park Band. In 1917 Remington joined the United States Navy and was assigned to the orchestra at a training station near Chicago. One of his bunkmates in the Navy orchestra was comedian/violinist Jack Benny. Professional career Upon returning from the Navy, Remington joined the Eastman Theater Orchestra in Rochester, also becoming a faculty member at the Eastman School of Music in 1922. He would remain on faculty there for the rest of his life. As a trombone teacher he was affectionately known to his students as \\"The Chief\\". He developed a system of legato warm-up exercises (now immortalized by Donald Hunsberger in his book, The Remington Warm-Up Studies ()) which have had major influences on trombone practising up to the present time. Remington was fond of singing, and during his lessons he would sing along with the student's trombone sound. He also encouraged his students to look for music to play that was outside of the common literature for trombone, especially music which would improve the singing characteristics of their trombone playing. His emphasis, whether in warm-up or in practice, was on relaxation and playing in a \\"conversational\\" and \\"singing\\" manner. This was quite different from the more traditional trombone methods of the time which focused on more marcato and regimented technical studies such as the Arban Method. Another of Remington's contributions was the Eastman Trombone Choir. A large ensemble of trombonists would gather to play music written for multiple trombones or transcribed from other sources, such as the chorales of Johann Sebastian Bach. Separating the different musical parts (i.e. SATB: soprano, alto, tenor, bass) into sections of trombonists, and transposing the music into the proper registers for the trombone. Remington encouraged his students to transcribe music for this ensemble, amassing a large library of \\"new\\" works for it. The music of J. S. Bach became the backbone of the ensemble. Remington used this great music as a tool to train his students in the art of ensemble performance. Ralph Sauer has made a fine reputation with his beautiful transcriptions of the music of Bach. Donald Hunsberger's transcription of Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue is considered one of the first of the great Bach transcriptions. Selected sections from his method include exercises designed around sustained long tones, security in the high register, legato tonguing, flexibility or \\"lip- slurs\\", and \\"pattern scales\\" (which would create a trombonist equally adept in all the keys). In 1954, Remington completed work in conjunction with C.G. Conn Ltd. in developing the C.G. Conn 88H tenor trombone. The unique tone color and dynamic range of the instrument have made it popular amongst trombonists and contributed to its continuous production from its debut in 1954 to the present. Conn also manufactured a \\"Remington\\" tenor trombone mouthpiece which was available in either silver or gold plate. Remington encouraged his first year students to switch to this mouthpiece, as it produced a beautiful clear sound with moderate effort. The effect of the 88H combined with the Remington mouthpiece produced a very uniform sound in the Trombone Choir and trombone sections in the large ensembles. As students progressed, they would be encouraged to switch to other mouthpieces to refine their sounds depending on performance conditions. Remington taught at the Eastman School for 49 years, teaching countless students, some of whom rank among the finest trombonists in history. He died on December 10, 1971. On October 20, 1979, Room 902 at the Eastman School of Music was formally named the Emory B. Remington Rehearsal Room. Remington (band) was named after Remington's son, David Remington (1926-2007).http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?n=david- w-remington&pid;=89202402 Remington's Effects Trombonists who studied with Emory Remington: *Larry Campbell - United States Coast Guard Band (Ret.) and Louisiana State University (Ret.) *James DeSano - Cleveland Orchestra, Oberlin Conservatory *Ralph Sauer - Los Angeles Philharmonic, Toronto Symphony *Roger Bobo - Rochester Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw, Los Angeles Philharmonic (Bobo studied briefly with Remington at Eastman) *Herbert (Sonny) Ausman - Los Angeles Philharmonic, recording engineer *Edwin Anderson - Cleveland Orchestra, Indiana University *Robert Gray - University of Illinois *Ernest Lyon - University of Louisville *Terry Cravens - University of Southern California *Charles Baker - New Jersey Symphony Orchestra *Gordon Cherry - Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, CBC Radio Orchestra, University of British Columbia, National Arts Center Orchestra, Cherry Classics Music publishing *Gregory Cox - Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, CBC Radio Orchestra, North Carolina Symphony, Eastern Music Festival *Gordon Pulis - New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Toronto Symphony, Metropolitan Opera Orchestra *Donald Knaub - Rochester Philharmonic, Eastman School of Music faculty, Professor of Trombone at University of Texas at Austin *Dr. Irvin Wagner - Oklahoma City Philharmonic, University of Oklahoma *Dr. Richard Fote - Crane School of Music of SUNY Potsdam, State College Fredonia New York, Erie Symphony PA *Byron McCulloh - Pittsburgh Symphony *George Osborn - Rochester Philharmonic, faculty Eastman School of Music *Bill Harris - Syracuse Symphony *Fred Boyd - South Carolina Philharmonic, Private Low Brass Teacher *Doug Courtright - Syracuse Symphony *Art Linsner - Chicago Freelance bass trombonist *Tony Dechario - Rochester Philharmonic *William McCauley - Composer, conductor, arranger, Director Seneca College, North York Symphony Orchestra conductor *Kenneth Knowles - Memorial University Newfoundland Canada *Dave Richey - Rochester Philharmonic *Raymond Premru - Philharmonia Orchestra (London), Oberlin Conservatory *Harold Steiman - Pittsburgh Symphony *Bernie Pressler - Ball State University *Hal Janks - Metropolitan Opera Orchestra *Richard Myers - Buffalo Philharmonic *Dennis Good - Nashville Symphony Orchestra *Dr. Russ Schultz - Memphis Symphony Orchestra, Central Washington University, Dean of Fine arts at Lamar University *Lewis Van Haney - New York Philharmonic, Indiana University *Elwood Williams - San Francisco Ballet, Williams Music Publishing *Bill Reichenbach Jr. - Los Angeles studio trombonist, soloist, arranger, composer *Anne Witherell - Private Trombone Teacher *Robert Boyd - Cleveland Orchestra *Dr. Donald Hunsberger - Eastman Wind Ensemble Music Director *David Fetter - Baltimore Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Peabody Conservatory *James E.

Early life Ribas was the last of eleven sons, born to a prominent Caracas family. In his early years, he received a quality education and attended the city's seminary. After finishing his studies, he began working in the agrarian sector. At the age of 21 he married María Josefa Palacios, the aunt of Simón Bolívar. He soon became interested in Republican ideals and sympathetic to the revolutionary independence movement. Ribas became involved in the Conspiracy of 1808, but was taken prisoner after its failure. In his defense, he stated that on the day of the action, he was just heading to a public square to spend time. Actually, Ribas was frequenting the square to meet with other republicans to plan an uprising. He was later freed by the authorities. When the Revolution of 19 April 1810 was taking place, it was reported that Ribas was seen travelling throughout the entire city, encouraging people to join-in the demonstrations against Spanish rule. In the aftermath he joined the interim government on April 25, taking charge of the municipality of Caracas. Military career Apart from his political functions in the interim government, and despite having no military background, Ribas was named Colonel of the Barlovento Battalion which he helped set up with his own funds. He also maintained some contact with Francisco de Miranda, and offered him all possible support when Miranda arrived in the country. Along with other fellow Republicans, he became a member of the Sociedad Patriótica organized by Francisco de Miranda, in contradistinction to the New Venezuelan Congress which was ruled mostly by the landed few. The Sociedad Patriótica was modeled after a French Jacobin Club, encouraging the practice of oratory on equality of rights to all citizens. During a brief period of Venezuelan independence (the Second Republic of Venezuela under the stewardship of Simón Bolívar), Ribas fought in numerous battles of the \\"Campaña Admirable\\"; however the most crucial episode was the battle of La Victoria (12 February 1814) in which he and his comrades succeeded in foiling the advance of José Tomás Boves's formidable royalist forces (commanded in this battle by proxy Francisco Tomás Morales, while Boves recovered from wounds). Ribas won this victory with inexperienced troops, composed mainly of youths, students, and seminary candidates that Ribas has succeeded in recruiting. Ribas told his young soldiers, his charges, before a crucial battle that \\"We have no choice between victory or death, we must achieve victory\\" (\\"No podemos optar entre vencer o morir, es necesario vencer\\"). After many hours of fierce resistance, Republican reinforcements arrived under the command of Vicente Campo Elías. It is in honor of this episode of Venezuelan history that modern Venezuelan citizens now celebrate the \\"Día de la Juventud\\" (\\"Day of Youth\\"). each 12 February.  Capture and death after Urica and Maturín  He fought vigorously in the Battle of Urica in which the republican forces lost but his royalist nemesis Boves was killed. After this battle, his forces assisted in offering a last desperate resistance to Morales at the Battle of Maturín; however this effort also was defeated. Ribas, together with a nephew and a faithful servant, was forced to flee from the victorious royalists. However, he was ultimately betrayed to the royalists by a slave. He was captured and executed by beheading. Ribas's lopped off head, after having been fried in cooking oil, was sent to Caracas. There, it was placed in public display within a small cage with the intention of demoralizing the patriots.  Legacy  Venezuelan bolívar banknote depicting José Félix Ribas, 2018 Almost two centuries later, Ribas' deeds were commemorated by the Hugo Chávez government when it named one of the Bolivarian Missions \\"Missión Ribas\\" in his honor. There are also two Venezuelan municipalities named after him, José Félix Ribas Municipality, Aragua state; and José Félix Ribas Municipality, Guárico state.

He has been part of many other projects including the controversial band Anal Cunt (also known as AC or AxCx). Aside from his music works, he currently works as a government computer specialist. Hull is noted for his experimental style of guitar playing that incorporates various influences, as well as for his use of eight string and seven string guitars. Head in the Picklejar Member: 1991 - 1995 (Guitars) Head in the Picklejar (known as HIPj) established Hull as a formidable guitar player with this thrash jazz trio (with Ben Eriksen on drums and Matt \\"Rosie\\" Rosen on Bass), genre hopping with songs about fishing, isolation, and the media. HIPj performed at CBGBs several times, opening for Urge Overkill, Unsane, the Supreme Dicks, Swinging Udders, and White Trash in their early days. HIPj had a previous incarnation as Technical Misanthrope which played from 1985-1988. Pig Destroyer Member: 1997–Present (Guitars) Scott can be seen as the driving force of Pig Destroyer's sound considering the lack of a bass player (until 2013). He uses a multiple amplifier setup with rigs set on either side of the stage during live shows, spreading out his sound to fill the void left by the missing bassist. You can hear his distinct sound on Pig Destroyer's most prevalent releases: Phantom Limb, Terrifyer, Prowler in the Yard and Explosions in Ward 6, which includes the 38 Counts of Battery, compilation album (remastered and including the complete discography of the band up until 2000). Recordings usually consist of multiple guitar tracks. Anal Cunt Member: 1995 (Guitars) Scott's guitar work can be heard on Anal Cunt's 1996 release 40 More Reasons to Hate Us. Although not as technical as Scott's work with Pig Destroyer, his heavy sound is still prevalent with AxCx. According to Seth Putnam, he (himself) did most of the guitar playing and a lot of the drumming, as Tim could not play what he wanted him to and Scott was too new in the band to know all of their songs, as well as the fact that Seth just wanted to play guitar. Agoraphobic Nosebleed Member: 1994–Present Formed in 1994, Scott has been the only permanent member in Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Their first live performance was in 2003 when Pig Destroyer cut their set short to let ANb play two songs and an intro. Hull's drum programming with Agoraphobic Nosebleed earned him the Top Spot on a Top 25 Drummers in Modern Metal list on heavy metal website MetalSucks. Japanese Torture Comedy Hour Member: 1996 - Unknown Formed by Scott Hull and former AC member Tim Morse, with Andrew Kokes doing electronics, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour is, as Scott puts it, a \\"hybrid of noisecore and power electronics.\\" Audio recordings are hard to come by for JTCH. Producer Scott is also known for his ability of producing and mastering not only his own projects' albums, but others' as well, such as the debut album by Sockweb. His studio, Visceral Sound, is based in Bethesda, Maryland. He is not to be confused with New York-based mastering engineer Scott Hull (owner of Masterdisk).

White on the Arts Quadrangle with Boardman Hall in the background The history of Cornell University begins when its two founders, Andrew Dickson White of Syracuse and Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, met in the New York State Senate in January 1864. Together, they established Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1865. The university was initially funded by Ezra Cornell's $400,000 endowment and by New York's allotment of the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862 However, even before Ezra Cornell and Andrew White met in the New York Senate, each had separate plans and dreams that would draw them toward their collaboration in founding Cornell. White believed in the need for a great university for the nation that would take a radical new approach to education; and Cornell, who had great respect for education and philanthropy, desired to use his money \\"to do the greatest good.\\" Abraham Lincoln's signing of Vermont Senator Justin Morrill's Land Grant Act into law was also critical to the formation of many universities, including Cornell, in the post-Civil War era. Precursors The first person to conceive of a single great university for the state of New York, a generation before Cornell, was the visionary, abolitionist, and philanthropist Gerrit Smith, from very much Upstate Peterboro. When the initial meeting of the very unpopular New York State Anti- Slavery Society was driven out of Utica (Oneida County) by the Mayor, it continued the next day in Smith's house. A new college was to be established in upstate New York. This Central College, as it came to be called, was the abolitionists' college, taking over that role from the failed Oneida Institute (whose other descendent was Oberlin College). Like Oneida, it was part of the manual labor college movement, in which students were to work for some hours each day in addition to study, such work being spiritually and economically beneficial. In McGraw, it was west of Peterboro. Central (1849–1860) was the first college in the United States that from its very first day was open to women, blacks, and Native Americans on an equal basis, something Oberlin was not. It was also the first to hire black faculty, and have them teaching a class with white students. That it allowed female students was just as unusual as allowing black studenrs. Central was financially unviable and victim of a lot of racial prejudice; some parents would not have their children study at \\"a nigger college\\", as it was called. When bankrupt, the entire college was taken over by Smith, who assumed its debts along with its meager assets. * * Founders alt=Ezra Cornell As newly elected members of the state senate, Cornell chaired the Committee of Agriculture, and White was the chair of the Committee of Literature, which dealt with educational matters. Hence, both chaired committees with jurisdiction over bills allocating the land grant, which was to be used for instruction in \\"without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactic, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts\\". Yet their eventual partnership seemed unlikely. Although both valued egalitarianism, science, and education, they had come from two very different backgrounds. Ezra Cornell, a self-made businessman and austere, pragmatic telegraph mogul, made his fortune on the Western Union Telegraph Company stock he received during the consolidation that led to its formation. Cornell, who had been poor for most of his life, suddenly found himself looking for ways that he could do the greatest good for with his money. He wrote, \\"My greatest care now is how to spend this large income to do the greatest good to those who are properly dependent on me, to the poor and to posterity.\\" Cornell's self-education and hard work would lead him to the conclusion that the greatest end for his philanthropy was in the need of colleges for the teaching of practical pursuits such as agriculture, the applied sciences, veterinary medicine and engineering, and in finding opportunities for the poor to attain such an education. alt=Andrew Dickson White Andrew Dickson White entered college at the age of 16 in 1849. White dreamed of going to one of the elite eastern colleges, but his father sent him to Geneva Academy (later known as the Hobart and William Smith Colleges), a small Episcopal college. At Geneva, White would read about the great colleges at Oxford University and at the University of Cambridge; this appears to be his first inspiration for \\"dreaming of a university worthy of the commonwealth [New York] and of the nation.\\" This dream would become a lifelong goal of White's. After a year at Geneva, White convinced his father to send him to Yale University. For White, Yale was a great improvement over Geneva, but he found that even at one of the country's great universities there was \\"too much reciting by rote and too little real intercourse.\\" In the late 1850s, while White served as a professor of history at the University of Michigan, he continued to develop his thoughts on a great American university. He was influenced by both the curriculum, which was more liberal than at the Eastern universities, and by the administration of the university as a secular institution. Conception White had been duly impressed by a bill introduced by Cornell in one of his first actions as a state senator: the incorporation of a large public library for Ithaca for which Cornell had donated $100,000. White was struck by not only his generosity, but also \\"his breadth of mind\\". He wrote: > The most striking sign of this was his mode of forming a board of trustees; > for, instead of the usual effort to tie up the organization forever in some > sect, party or clique, he had named the best men of his town — his political > opponents as well as his friends; and had added to them the pastors of all > the principal churches, Catholic and Protestant. Yet, Cornell and White soon found themselves on opposite sides of a battle that would in the end lead to the creation of Cornell University. In 1863, the legislature had granted the proceeds of the land grant to the People's College in Havana (now Montour Falls), with conditions that would need to be met within a certain time frame. Because the Morrill Act set a five-year limit on each state identifying a land grant college, and it seemed unlikely that the People's College would meet its conditions, the legislature was ready to select a different school. Initially, Cornell, as a member of the Board of Trustees of the New York State Agricultural College at Ovid, wanted half the grant to go to that school. However, White \\"vigorously opposed this bill, on the ground that the educational resources of the state were already too much dispersed\\".Becker, op. cite p. 82. He felt that the grant would be most effective if it were used to establish or strengthen a comprehensive university. Still working to send part of the grant to the Agricultural College, on September 25, 1864, in Rochester, New York, Cornell announced his offer to donate $300,000 (soon thereafter increased to $500,000) if part of the land grant could be secured and the trustees moved the college to Ithaca. White did not relent; however, he said he would support a similar measure that did not split up the grant. Thus began the collaboration between Ezra Cornell and Andrew D. White that became Cornell University. Establishment Senate bill to establish Cornell University On February 7, 1865, Andrew D. White introduced an act to the State Senate \\"to establish the Cornell University\\", which appropriated the full income of the sale of lands given to New York under the Morrill Act to the university. But, while Cornell and White had come to an agreement, they faced fierce opposition, including from the People's College in Havana, the Agricultural College at Ovid, and dozens of other institutions across the state vying for a share of the land grant funds; from religious groups, who opposed the proposed composition of the university's board of trustees; and even from the secular press, some of whom thought Cornell was swindling the state out of its federal land grant. To placate legislators representing Ovid, White arranged for the Willard State Asylum for the Insane to be located on the land held for the Agricultural College. The bill limited the total amount of property or endowment that Cornell University could hold to $3 million.. See also Section 5 of the Cornell charter. The bill was modified at least twice in attempts to attain the votes necessary for passage. In the first change, the People's College was given three months to meet certain conditions for which it would receive the land grant under the 1863 law. The second came from a Methodist faction, which wanted a share of the grant for Genesee College. They agreed to a quid-pro-quo donation of $25,000 from Ezra Cornell in exchange for their support. Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill. The bill was signed into law by Governor Reuben E. Fenton on April 27, 1865. On July 27, the People's College lost its claim to the land grant funds, and the building of Cornell University began. From 1865 to 1868, the year the university opened, Ezra Cornell and Andrew D. White worked in tireless collaboration to build their university. Cornell oversaw the construction of the university's first buildings, starting with Morrill Hall, and spent time investing the federal land scrip in western lands for the university that would eventually net millions of dollars, while White, who was unanimously elected the first President of Cornell University by the Board of Trustees on November 21, 1866, began making plans for the administrative and educational policies of the university. To this end, he traveled to France, Germany, and England \\"to visit model institutions, to buy books and equipment, to collect professors\\". White returned from Europe to be inaugurated as Cornell's president in 1868, and he remained leader of Cornell until his retirement from the presidency in 1885. Opening alt=Cornell faculty in 1882 The university's Inauguration Day took place on October 7, 1868. The previous day, each of the candidates who showed up in Ithaca was given an entrance examination. There were 412 successful applicants; with this initial enrollment, Cornell's first class was, at the time, the largest entering class at an American university. On the occasion, Ezra Cornell delivered a brief speech. He said, \\"I hope we have laid the foundation of an institution which shall combine practical with liberal education. ... I believe we have made the beginning of an institution which will prove highly beneficial to the poor young men and the poor young women of our country.\\" His speech included another statement which later became the school's motto, \\"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\\" Two other Ezra Cornell-founded, Ithaca institutions played a role in the rapid opening of the university. The Cornell Library, a public library in downtown Ithaca which opened in 1866, served as a classroom and library for the first students. Also Cascadilla Hall, which was constructed in 1866 as a water cure sanitarium, served at the university's first dormitory. Cornell was among the first universities in the United States to admit women alongside men. The first woman was admitted to Cornell in 1870, although the university did not yet have a women's dormitory. On February 13, 1872, Cornell's Board of Trustees accepted an offer of $250,000 from Henry W. Sage to build such a dormitory. During the construction of Sage College (now home to the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management as Sage Hall) and after its opening in 1875, the admittance of women to Cornell continued to increase. Significant departures from the standard curriculum were made at Cornell under the leadership of Andrew D. White. In 1868, Cornell introduced the elective system, under which students were free to choose their own course of study. Harvard University would make a similar change in 1872, soon after the inauguration of Charles W. Eliot in 1869. It was the success of the egalitarian ideals of the newly established Cornell, a uniquely American institution, that would help drive some of the changes seen at other universities throughout the next few decades, and would lead educational historian Frederick Rudolph to write: > Andrew D. White, its first president, and Ezra Cornell, who gave it his > name, turned out to be the developers of the first American university and > therefore the agents of revolutionary curricular reform.Quoted in plaque on Uris Library referencing Sage's gift in lieu of Jennie McGraw's estate paymentalt=Uris Library plaque In 1892, the university library was opened. Known today as Uris Library, it was the result of a gift from Henry W. Sage in memory of Jennie McGraw. In her will, she left $300,000 to her husband Willard Fiske, $550,000 to her brother Joseph and his children, $200,000 to Cornell for a library, $50,000 for construction of McGraw Hall, $40,000 for a student hospital, and the remainder to the University for whatever use it saw fit. However, the University's charter limited its property holdings to $3,000,000, and Cornell could not accept the full amount of McGraw's gift. When Fiske realized that the university had failed to inform him of this restriction, he launched a legal assault to re-acquire the money, known as The Great Will Case. The United States Supreme Court eventually affirmed the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals that Cornell could not receive the estate on May 19, 1890, with Justice Samuel Blatchford giving the majority opinion., accessed 7/25/06Cornell Loses a Legacy: Decision Against the University in the Fisk Suit. The Highest Court Holds that it Cannot Receive the Gift – A Big Fee For David B. Hill. The New York Times May 20, 1890; accessed May 28, 2008 However, Sage then donated $500,000 to build the library instead. Coeducation =Background= Sage College was the constructed as the women's dormitory in 1872 In the mid 19th Century, coeducation was still a new and controversial idea. Most colleges were exclusively male, and several women's colleges had been founded as a response. But prior to Cornell's charter in 1865, few colleges were devoted to coeducation. (It is worth noting that coeducation did not catch on broadly with elite northeastern schools, including the Ivy League, until the 1960s) Oberlin College and University of Michigan were two coeducational colleges which predated Cornell's founding, and provided models for Cornell. The carnage of the American Civil War had introduced women into new areas of experience and leadership, and because of war casualties women outnumbered men in the United States. Central New York, and especially nearby Seneca Falls, was the center of the 19th-century women's rights movement. Cornell's founders Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White favored coeducation and had deliberately included language in the school's charter specifying that it would offer instruction to \\"any person.\\" Still, the school had no explicit policy about accepting women, and Cornell enrolled its first class in 1868 with 412 men and no women. In theory, the school would accept any person who could pass the admission requirements, but no facilities existed for women at its start, and the reality of admitting women was not immediately clear. In September 1870, one Jennie Spencer, of Cortland, New York, passed a state scholarship examination thus becoming Cornell's first female student. Because of the lack of housing for women on campus, Spencer lived in downtown Ithaca, requiring her to walk up the hill for classes. This was an arduous task in Ithaca's harsh weather, considering the condition of the roads and the bulky Victorian dress of the time. Spencer reluctantly left Cornell without graduating, but her situation raised awareness of the need for housing and facilities for women on campus. =Sage College= Architectural sketch of Sage College, 1871 Henry W. Sage, local businessman and philanthropist, was an advocate for coeducation and promised to donate a sum of $250,000 on the condition that Cornell admit women on equal footing as men. This financial incentive, together with the support of both Cornell and White, led the trustees to formally vote to admit women starting April 1872. This decision caused Goldwin Smith, Cornell's most illustrious professor, to resign; Smith was convinced that admitting women would destroy Cornell's academic reputation. In May 1873 the cornerstone was laid for Sage College for Women, a residence built specially to accommodate 120 women students. In the fall of 1875, Cornell admitted forty-nine women. Twenty-nine lived in the newly opened Sage College; another twenty lived in boarding houses or with relatives. In 1895, 224 women were enrolled in the university, 104 of whom lived in Sage College. =Early growth= As women entered the university, the university made accommodations for them. In 1884, Henry Sage endowed several of the first scholarships in the nation earmarked especially for women. In 1885, Cornell established a course in social work, a field seen as suited to women's academic interests. In 1900, a correspondence course for farmer's wives was begun by Martha Van Rensselaer, which evolved into the College of Home Economics, later the College of Human Ecology. \\"Cornell University\\" by renowned landscape artist Richard Rummell (1848–1924), circa 1910. Sage Hall is depicted in the lower right.\\"Arader Galleries Iconic College Views\\", Rummell, Richard, Littig & Co. 1915 In 1895, a study was conducted to review the first twenty years of coeducation at Cornell. The study found that a total of 990 women had attended the university; of these, 325 received degrees, of which fifty-five were graduate degrees. Seventeen Cornell graduates went on to further advanced study, many of whom were the first women to gain admission to those institutions. Although a small percentage of the student body, women students per capita were found to outperform their male counterparts in terms of scholarships, fellowships, and other academic honors. Some early notable women Cornell students included embryologist Susanna Phelps Gage, engineer Kate Gleason, Bryn Mawr president M. Carey Thomas, Wellesley president Julia Irvine, social reformer Florence Kelley '82, naturalist Anna Botsford Comstock '85, psychologist Margaret Floy Washburn Ph.D.'94, surgeon Emily Barringer '97, M.D.'01, lawyer/suffragist Gail Laughlin L.L.B.'98, editor and poet Jessie Redmon Fauset '05 and educator Martha Van Rensselaer '09. In 1911, philanthropist Olivia Sage donated $300,000 for the construction of a second women's dormitory, Risley Residential College. The building was named for her late husband's mother. =Separate lives= The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women. Early in the history of the university, female students were separated from male students in many ways.Fogle, Homer William Jr., \\"∆X of ∆KE Research Note #06: Anti-coedism Philosophy and Mores\\" July 10, 2010. Cornell University Archives. For example, they had a separate entrance and lounges in Willard Straight Hall, a separate student government, and a separate page (edited by women) in the Cornell Daily Sun. The male students were required to take \\"drill\\" (a precursor to ROTC), but the women were exempt. One account of the history of coeducation at Cornell claims that in the very beginning, \\"[m]ale students were almost unanimously opposed to co- education, and vigorously protested the arrival of a group of 16 women, who promptly formed a women's club with a broom for their standard, and 'In hoc signo vinces' as their motto.\\" In the 1870s and 1880s, female Cornell students on campus were generally ignored by male students. Women did not have a formal role in the annual commencement ceremony until 1935, when the senior class selected a woman to be Class Poet. In 1936, the Willard Straight Hall Board of Managers voted to allow women to eat in its cafeteria. Until the 1970s, male students resided in west campus dormitories while women were housed in the north campus. As of 2019, the only remaining women's dormitory is Balch Hall, due to a restriction in the gift that funded it. Lyon Hall (which for most of its history was a men-only dormitory), also currently disallows male residents on its lower floors. All other dormitories were converted to co-educational housing in the late 1970s. =Veterinary College= The NYS College of Veterinary Medicine was an early pioneer in educating women, bestowing the first DVM degree on a woman in the United States, Florence Kimball, in 1910. However, until the early 1980s, the Vet College limited the number of women in each entering class to four or less, regardless of female applicants' qualifications. A pictorial spread about Cornell in Harper's Weekly in 1873 =Title IX= With the implementation of Title IX in the mid-1970s, Cornell significantly expanded its athletic offerings for women. The Department of Physical Education and Athletics moved from having all women's activities housed in Helen Newman Hall to having men's and women's programs in all facilities. Nonsectarianism and religion on campus Sage Chapel opened in 1875 Up until the time of Cornell's founding, most prominent American colleges had ties to religious denominations.Becker op. cite. at 7–14. Cornell was founded as a non-sectarian school, but had to compete with church-sponsored institutions for gaining New York's land-grant status. A.D. White noted in his inaugural address, \\"We will labor to make this a Christian institution, a sectarian institution may it never be.\\" However, the university has made provision for voluntary religious observance on campus. Currently, the University Charter provides, \\"Persons of every religious denomination, or of no religious denomination, shall be equally eligible to all offices and appointments\\".New York State Education Law §5702. Through the 20th century, the University Charter also required that a majority of trustees could not be of any single denomination. Sage Chapel, a non-denominational house of worship opened in 1875. Since 1929, the Cornell United Religious Works (CURW) has been an umbrella organization for the campus chaplains sponsored by different denominations and faiths. Perhaps the most newsworthy of the chaplains was Daniel Berrigan who, while Assistant Director of CURW, became a national leader in protesting the Vietnam War. In 1971, the social activism aspects of CURW were spun off into a separate Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy (CRESP). In 2006, CRESP was reorganized as Cornell's Center for Transformative Action. In the late 1950s, the National Council of Young Israel (NCYI) leased a house across the street from the university and established a Jewish living center and kosher dining hall. The Cornell Young Israel chapter became the Center for Jewish Living, and a new Foundation for Kosher Observance at Cornell, Inc. was established so that the university's dining department would operate both a kosher kitchen at the center as well as serving kosher food on the North Campus. Since the 1870s, Cornell's system of fraternities and sororities grew to play a large role in student life, with many chapters becoming a part of national organizations. As of 1952, 19 fraternities had national restrictions based on race, religion or national origin, and of the 32 fraternities without such national requirements, 19 did not have \\"mixed\\" memberships. In response, the undergraduate Interfraternity Council passed a resolution condemning discrimination. In the 1960s, the Trustees established a Commission to examine the membership restrictions of those national organizations. Cornell adopted a policy that required fraternities and sororities affiliated with nationals that discriminated based on religion or race to either amend their national charters or quit the national organizations. As a result, a number of national Greek organizations dropped racial or religious barriers to their membership. In 1873, the cornerstone of Sage Hall was laid. This new hall was to house the Sage College for Women and thus to concretely establish Cornell University's coeducational status. Ezra Cornell wrote a letter for posterity—dated May 15, 1873—and sealed it into the cornerstone. No copies of the letter were made, and Cornell kept its contents a secret. However, he hinted at the theme of the letter during his speech at the dedication of Sage Hall, stating that \\"the letter deposited in the cornerstone addressed to the future man and woman, of which I have kept no copy, will relate to future generations the cause of the failure of this experiment, if it ever does fail, as I trust in God it never will.\\" Cornell historians largely assumed that the \\"experiment\\" to which Cornell referred was that of coeducation, given that Sage Hall was to be a women's dormitory and that coeducation was still a controversial issue at the time. However, when the letter was finally unearthed in 1997, its focus was revealed to be the university's nonsectarian status—a principle which had invited equal controversy in the 19th century, given that most universities of the time had specific religious affiliations. Cornell wrote: Infrastructure innovations Between 1872 and 1875, the university's first professor of physics William Arnold Anthony and student George S Moler (later, a professor at Cornell) installed two electric arc lamps on campus, one of which was in the Sage Chapel tower. The set-up represented many firsts, the first dynamo and outdoor electric lighting in the United States, and the world's first underground electricity distribution system. It was said to be the \\"first locality in America, if not the world, to have a permanent installation of electric arc lamps.\\" The lamps were \\"visible for many miles around, and it excited the wonder of the inhabitants.\\" In 1883, Cornell was one of the first university campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981. In 1986–87, a cogeneration facility was added to the central heating plant to generate electricity from the plant's waste heat. A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, shifted the central heating plant from using coal to natural gas and enable the plant to generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements. In the 1880s, a suspension bridge was built across Fall Creek to provide pedestrian access to the campus from the North. In 1913, Professors S.C. Hollister and William McGuire designed a new suspension bridge that is , 3.5 in. above the water and downstream from the original. However, the second bridge was declared unsafe and closed August 1960 to be rebuilt with a replacement of the same design. The Arecibo Observatory, radio and radar telescope, from its construction in the 1960s until 2011, was managed by Cornell University. Cornell began operating a closed loop, central chilled water system for air conditioning and laboratory cooling in the 1963 using centralized mechanical chillers, rather than inefficient, building-specific air conditioners. In 2000, Cornell began operation of its Lake Source Cooling System which uses the cold water temperature at the bottom of Cayuga Lake (approx 39 °F) to air condition the campus. The system was the first wide-scale use of lake source cooling in North America. Giving and alumni involvement The first endowed chair at Cornell was the Professorship of Hebrew and Oriental Literature and History donated by New York City financier Joseph Seligman in 1874, with the proviso that he (Seligman) would nominate the chairholder; and following his wishes, Dr. Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture), was appointed. After two years, Professor Adler was quietly let go. Seligman demanded an inquiry. On rebuffing Joseph Seligman in 1877, the Trustees established one of their guiding principles governing the receipt of gifts, \\"That in the future no Endowment of Professorships will be accepted by the (Cornell) University which deprives the Board of Trustees of the power to Select The persons who shall fill such professorships\\". In September 1896, Cornell's president Jacob Gould Schurman prevailed upon the Board of Trustees to extend an offer to Nathaniel Schmidt. The situation at Colgate's Divinity School had deteriorated. Schmidt's unorthodox theology generated discomfort within that college. From 1886 to the arrival of Professor Nathaniel Schmidt in 1896, Cornell's Library maintained its support for the acquisition of Near Eastern materials. Taking over as Cornell President, Jacob Gould Schurman decided Cornell needed a chair of Hebrew language. In 1896, Schurman persuaded Henry W. Sage to finance a professor of Semitic Languages and Literatures for AY1896-97 and AY 1897-98. He knew the University could secure Schmidt at a bargain. Schmidt's unorthodox theological views made his stay at Colgate Divinity School untenable. Schmidt gained the respect of the Cornell community. Noted for his personal and scholarly integrity, he was soon shielded by sympathetic administrators. Schmidt served Cornell for thirty-six years, carrying a high teaching load in addition to this extensive research. He taught an elementary course in Hebrew each year. Advanced Hebrew covered the leading writers of the Old Testament and some parts of the Mishnaic and other Talmudic literature in three years. General linguistics students were advised to begin their study of Semitic languages with Arabic, also offered each year. Aramaic and Egyptian alternated with Assyrian and Ethiopic. The Semitic Seminary, given one term each year, was dedicated to epigraphical studies. The second was the Susan E. Linn Sage Professor of Ethics and Philosophy given in 1890 by Henry W. Sage. Since then, 327 named professorships have been established, of which 43 are honorary and do not have endowments. The university's first endowed scholarship was established in 1892. The original University charter adopted by the New York State legislature required that Cornell give scholarships from students in each legislative district to attend the University tuition-free. Although both Cornell and White believed this meant one scholarship, the legislature later argued that it meant one new freshman student per district each year, or four per district. This allowed students of diverse financial resources to attend the university from the start. When Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Dredging Company John McMullen left his estate to Cornell to establish scholarships for engineering students, Cornell's Trustees decided to invest those funds and eventually sold the dredging company. The resulting fund is Cornell's largest single scholarship endowment. Since 1925, the fund has provided substantial assistance to more than 3,700 engineering students. (Cornell has received a number of unusual non-cash (in-kind) gifts over the years, including: Ezra Cornell's farm, the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (see below), a copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, a Peruvian mummy, and the Ostrander elm trees.) Before the university opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However that provision did not become operative until there were at least 100 alumni in 1872.Kasson (at 109); Whalen (at 15) says the first election was in 1874. Cornell was one of the first Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was probably the first to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.Whalen at 15. In October 1890, Andrew Carnegie became a Cornell Trustee and quickly became aware of the lack of an adequate pension plans for Cornell faculty. His concern led to the formation in 1905 of what is now called Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA).Cornell Financial Plan May 2007 p. 32 In October 2010, David A. Atkinson and his wife Patricia donated $80 million to fund a sustainability center, and the gift is currently the largest single gift to Cornell (ignoring inflation) and is the largest ever given to a university for sustainability research and faculty support. Many alumni classes elected secretaries to maintain correspondence with classmates. In 1905, the Class Secretaries organized to form what is now called the Cornell Association of Class Officers, which meets annually to develop alumni class programs and assist in organizing reunions. The Cornell Alumni News is an independent, alumni-owned publication founded in 1899 It is owned and controlled by the Cornell Alumni Association, a separate nonprofit corporation and is now known as Cornell Alumni Magazine. Support from New York State Under the Morrill Act, states were obligated to fund the maintenance of land grant college facilities, but were not obligated to fund operations. Subsequent laws required states to match federal funds for agricultural research stations and cooperative extension. In his inaugural address as Cornell's third president on November 11, 1892, Jacob Gould Schurman announced his intention to enlist the financial support of the state. Until that point, Cornell's relationship with the state was a net economic loss. Cornell was offering full scholarships to four students in each New York assembly district every year and was spending funds to serve as the state's land-grant university. It determined to convince the state to become a benefactor of the university, instead. In 1894, the state legislature voted to give financial support for the establishment of the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine and to make annual appropriations for the college. This set the precedents of privately controlled, state-supported statutory colleges and cooperation between Cornell and the state. The annual state appropriations were later extended to agriculture, home economics, and following World War II, industrial and labor relations. In 1882, Cornell opened the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, the sixth oldest institution of its kind in the United States.Experiment Station History Retrieved 2010-03-07. It made significant advances in scientific agriculture and for many years played an active role in agriculture law enforcement. In 1900, a home economics curriculum was added to Cornell's Agriculture college. This was expanded to a separate state-supported school in 1919. Retrieved 2010-11-05. The Home Economics School, in turn, began to develop classes in hotel administration in 1922, which spun off into a separate, endowed college in 1950.History Retrieved 2010-03-27. In 1898, the New York State College of Forestry opened at Cornell, which was the first forestry college in North America. The College undertook to establish a demonstration forest in the Adirondacks, funded by New York State. However, the plans of the school's director Bernhard Fernow for the land drew criticism from neighbors living on Saranac Lake, Knollwood Club, and Governor Benjamin B. Odell vetoed the 1903 appropriation for the school. In response, Cornell closed the school. By some reports, Cornell gained annual state funding of the College of Agriculture in exchange for closing the forestry college.Education & Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University,1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 162, Cornell University Press Subsequently, in 1911, the State Legislature established a New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, and the remains of Cornell's program became the Department of Natural Resources in its Agriculture College in 1910. However, Cornell had contracted with the Brooklyn Cooperage Company to take the logs from the forest, and the People of the State of New York, Knollwood Club members (\\"People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company and Cornell\\") sued to stop the destructive practices of Fernow even before the closing of the school. Cornell University lost the case in 1910 and on appeal in 1912. Cornell eventually established a research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods. When New York State later funded the construction of a Forestry building for the Agriculture school, New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell named it Fernow Hall. In 1914, the US Department of Agriculture began to fund cooperative extension services through the land-grant college of each state, and Cornell expanded its impact by sending agents to spread knowledge in each county of New York State. Although Syracuse had started awarding forestry degrees at this point, Cornell's extension agents covered all of home economics and agriculture, including forestry. In 1945, the New York State Legislature founded the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell, in response to requests from organized labor and Democratic leaders. The school quickly gained national stature when U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, who was the first female US Cabinet member and served longer than anyone else as Secretary of Labor (12 years), joined the ILR faculty. Since agricultural interests were mostly affiliated with the Republicans, Cornell enjoyed bi-partisan support following World War II. In 1948, the Legislature placed all state-funded higher education into the new State University of New York (SUNY). Cornell's four statutory colleges (agriculture, human ecology, labor relations and veterinary medicine) have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception, but did not have any such state affiliation prior to that time. Statutory college employees legally are employees of Cornell, not employees of SUNY. The State Education Law gives the SUNY Board of Trustees the authority to approve Cornell's appointment of the deans/unit heads of the statutory colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the statutory colleges.N.Y.S. Education Law § 355(g). Today, state support is significant. In 2007–08, Cornell received a total of $174 million of state appropriations for operations.Cornell Financial Plan May 2007 p. 75 Of the $2.5 billion in capital spending budgeted for 2007–2017, $721 million was to come from the state of New York.Cornell Financial Plan May 2007 p. 65 Medical education Starting in 1878, Cornell's Ithaca campus offered a pre- medical school curriculum, although most medical students enrolled in medical school directly after high school. In 1896, three New York City institutions, the University Medical College, the Loomis Laboratory and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College united with the goal of affiliating with New York University (NYU). Unfortunately, NYU imposed a number of surprising new policies including limiting faculty to what they would have otherwise earned in private practice.Bishop, op cite. p. 318 The faculty revolted in 1897 and sought the return of the property of the three former institutions, with a resulting lawsuit. On March 22, 1904 and April 5, 1904, the New York State Court of Appeals ordered NYU to return property to Loomis Laboratory because the NYU Dean had breached oral promises made to form the merger.Bishop, op cite. p. 319 Having won their separation from NYU, the medical faculties sought a new university affiliation, and on April 14, 1898, Cornell's Board of Trustees voted to create a medical school and elected former NYU professors as its dean and faculty.Bishop, op cite. p. 320 The school opened on October 4, 1898 in the Loomis Laboratory facilities. In 1900, a new campus on First Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan opened which was donated by Oliver Hazard Payne. Cornell also began a program in the fall of 1898 to allow students to take their first two years of medical school in Ithaca, with Stimson Hall being constructed to house that program. The building opened in 1903.Bishop, op cite. p. 388 The M.D. degree program was open to both men and women, but women were required to study in Ithaca for their first two years.Bishop, op cite. p. 321 In 1908, Cornell was one of the early medical schools to require an undergraduate degree as a prerequisite to admission to the M.D. program.Bishop, op cite. p. 385 In 1913, Cornell's medical school affiliated with New York Hospital as its teaching hospital. Unlike the New York branch of the medical school which was well endowed, the Ithaca branch was subsidized by the University, and the Trustees reduced its scope to just first year students in 1910, and eventually phased it out.Bishop, op cite. p. 389 NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell In 1927, William Payne Whitney's $27 million donation led to the building of the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, which became the name for Weill Cornell's large psychiatric effort. That same year, the college became affiliated with New York Hospital and the two institutions moved to their current joint campus in 1932. The hospital's Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979. In 1998, Cornell University Medical College's affiliate hospital, New York Hospital, merged with Presbyterian Hospital (the affiliate hospital for Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons). The combined institution operates today as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Despite the clinical alliance, the faculty and instructional functions of the Cornell and Columbia units remain distinct and independent. Multiple fellowships and clinical programs have merged, however, and the institutions are continuing in their efforts to bring together departments, which could enhance academic efforts, reduce costs, and increase public recognition. All hospitals in the NewYork- Presbyterian Healthcare System are affiliated with one of the two colleges. Also in 1998, the medical college was renamed as Weill Medical College of Cornell University after receiving a substantial endowment from Sanford I. Weill, then Chairman of Citigroup. Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory Curtiss-Wright built this lab facility located in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York as a part of the World War II effort. As a part of its tax planning in the wake of the war effort, Curtiss-Wright donated the facility to Cornell University to operate \\"as a public trust\\" and received a charitable tax deduction. Seven other east coast aircraft companies also donated $675,000 to provide working capital for the lab. The lab operated under the name Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory from 1946 until 1972. During this same time, Cornell formed a new Graduate School of Aerospace Engineering on its Ithaca, New York campus. CAL invented the first crash test dummy in 1948, the automotive seat belt in 1951, the first mobile field unit with Doppler weather radar for weather-tracking in 1956, the first accurate airborne simulation of another aircraft (the North American X-15) in 1960, the first successful demonstration of an automatic terrain-following radar system in 1964, the first use of a laser beam to successfully measure gas density in 1966, the first independent HYGE sled test facility to evaluate automotive restraint systems in 1967, the mytron, an instrument for research on neuromuscular behavior and disorders in 1969, and the prototype for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's fingerprint reading system in 1972. CAL served as an \\"honest broker\\" making objective comparisons of competing plans to build military hardware. It also conducted classified counter-insurgency research in Thailand for the Defense Department. By the time of its divestiture, CAL had 1,600 employees. CAL conducted wind tunnel test on models of a number of skyscraper buildings, including most notably the John Hancock Tower in Boston, Massachusetts and the 40-story Commerce House in Seattle, Washington. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities came under criticism for conducting war-related research particularly as the Vietnam War became unpopular, and Cornell University tried to sever its ties. Cornell accepted a $25,000,000 offer from EDP Technology, Inc. to purchase the lab in 1968. However, a group of lab employees who had made a competing $15,000,000 offer organized a lawsuit to block the sale. In May 1971, New York's highest court ruled that Cornell had the right to sell the lab. At the conclusion of the suit, EDP Technology could not raise the money, and in 1972, Cornell reorganized the lab as the for-profit Calspan Corporation and then sold its stock in Calspan to the public. Race relations Cornell had enrolled African-American students by the mid-1880s. On December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha, the first Greek letter fraternity for African-Americans was founded at Cornell. Cornell had a very low black enrollment until the 1960s, when it formed the Committee on Special Educational Projects (COSEP) to recruit and mentor minority students. In 1969, Cornell established its Africana Studies and Research Center, one of the first such black studies programs in the Ivy League. On April 1, 1970, during a period of heightened racial tension, the building that housed the Africana Studies center burned down. Since 1972, Ujamaa, a special interest program dormitory located in North Campus Low Rise No. 10, provides housing for many non-white students. However, in 1974, the New York State Board of Regents ordered it desegregated, and its status remained controversial for years. =Willard Straight Hall Takeover= Willard Straight Hall On April 19, 1969, during a parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society took over the student union building, Willard Straight Hall. The takeover was precipitated by increasing racial tension at the university and the students' frustration with the administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.Donald Alexander Downs, Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University, (Ithaca, NY.: Cornell University Press, 1999), p. 172 By the following day a deal was brokered between the students and university officials, and on April 20, the takeover ended, with the administration ceding to some of the Afro-American Society's demands. The students emerged making a black-power salute and with guns in hand (the guns had been brought into Willard Straight Hall after the initial takeover). James A. Perkins, president of Cornell during the events, resigned soon after the crisis. Some of the elements of the deal required faculty approval, and the faculty voted to uphold the reprimands of the three students on April 21. The faculty was asked to reconsider, and a group of 2,000 to 10,000 gathered in Barton Hall to debate the matter as the faculty deliberated. This \\"Barton Hall Community\\" formed a representative Constituent Assembly which undertook a comprehensive review of the University. Among the changes stemming from the crisis were the founding of an Africana Studies and Research Center, overhaul of the campus governance and judicial system, and the addition of students to Cornell's Board of Trustees. The crisis also prompted New York to enact the Henderson Law requiring every college in the State to adopt rules for the maintenance of public order. Historian Donald Kagan, was a professor at Cornell from 1958 to 1969 and left Cornell due to the takeover. Kagan was once a liberal democrat, but his views changed after the takeover and became one of the original signers to the 1997 Statement of Principles by the neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century. According to Jim Lobe, cited in The Fall of the House of Bush by Craig Unger (p. 39, n.), Kagan's turn away from liberalism occurred in 1969 when Cornell University was pressured into starting a \\"Black Studies\\" program by gun-wielding students seizing Willard Straight Hall on campus: \\"Watching administrators demonstrate all the courage of Neville Chamberlain had a great impact on me, and I became much more conservative.\\" Former Cornell Professor Thomas Sowell also left Cornell over the takeover. Sowell characterized the students as \\"hoodlums\\" with \\"serious academic problems [and] admitted under lower academic standards\\" and noted \\"it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four years that I taught at Cornell and lived in Ithaca.\\" Interdisciplinary studies Historically, Cornell's colleges have operated with great autonomy, each with a separate admissions policy, separate faculty, separate fundraising staff and in many cases, separate tuition structure. However, the University has taken steps to encourage collaboration between related academic fields within the University and with outside organizations. In the 1960s, the University created a Division of Biological Sciences to unify related programs in the Art and Agriculture colleges. Although a success, the structure was ultimately dropped in 1999 due to difficulty with funding. A \\"Faculty of Computing and Information Science\\" was established in 1999 to unify computer science efforts throughout the University. This structure obviates the need for a separate school or college of computer science. For its first ten years, Robert Constable served as its dean. Affordability and use of the endowment Since the 1970s, tuition at Cornell and other Ivy League schools has grown much faster than inflation. This trend coincided with the creation of Federally guaranteed student loan programs. At the same time, the endowments of these schools continue to grow due to gifts and successful investments. Critics called for universities to keep their tuition at affordable levels and to not hoard endowment earnings. As a result, in 2008, Cornell and other Ivy Schools decided to increase the spending of endowment earnings in order to subsidize tuition for low and middle income families, reducing the amount of debt that Cornell students will incur. Cornell also placed a priority to soliciting endowed scholarships for undergraduates. In fall 2007, Cornell had 1,863 undergraduates (14% of all undergraduates) receiving federal Pell Grants. Cornell's Pell Grant students roughly totals the combined Pell Grant recipients studying at Harvard, Princeton and Yale.\\"Your Gift Matters\\" Cornell University. 2009. Portrayal in fiction Students and faculty have chronicled Cornell in works of fiction. The most notable was The Widening Stain which first appeared anonymously. It was since revealed to have been written by Morris Bishop. Alison Lurie wrote a fictional account of the campus during the Vietnam War protests called The War Between the Tates. Matt Ruff captured Cornell around 1985 in The Fool on the Hill. Richard Fariña wrote a novel based on a real 1958 protest led by Kirkpatrick Sale against in loco parentis policies in Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me. Steve Thayer takes his readers to the Cornell campus in Ithaca Falls, a mystery thriller about a Cornell criminologist who travels back to 1929 in pursuit of a serial killer. Ed Helms' character Andrew Bernard of the hit show The Office was an alumnus of Cornell University.

Life He was born on April 22, 1766 in Amenia, New York. He was admitted to the bar in 1792, and commenced practice in Norwich. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1798-99, from 1804 to 1805, and from 1807 to 1809. In 1809, he was elected a U.S. Senator from New York, and served from March 4, 1809 to March 3, 1815. German was known as a critic of the lack of military preparations made in advance of the War of 1812, and voted against the declaration of war. In 1812, German was one of the founding trustees of Hamilton College. He was First Judge of the Chenango County Court from 1814 to 1819. He was also a State militia officer, eventually becoming a major general. Supporting DeWitt Clinton's Erie Canal project, German took part in planning and overseeing its construction after being appointed State Commissioner of Public Works in 1817. German returned to the Assembly in 1819 as a member of the Clintonian faction of the Democratic-Republican Party and was chosen to serve as Speaker. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law. German became a Whig when that party was organized. He died on September 24, 1842 in Norwich, New York. He was buried at North Norwich Cemetery in North Norwich, New York. Family Obadiah German was married twice. He had five children with his first wife, Mary Ann Lewis, known as Ann, who died in 1829. After the death of his first wife he married Mary Ann Knight, a woman much younger than he. They had three children, and by some accounts the marriage was not a happy one, with Mary Ann Knight and the children living in Syracuse while Obadiah German continued to reside in Norwich. Widow Obadiah German's widow Mary Ann Knight claimed to have been defrauded by her brother (some accounts say German's brother) of German's estate, worth $70,000 (about $1.7 million in 2014). She took up residence in Syracuse, and became a public charge, her efforts at earning a living through painting and \\"fancy work\\" having failed. Her claim to be the widow of Sen. German was not believed in Syracuse until it was confirmed after her death \\"in a state of great destitution,\\" according to the Syracuse Journal.\\"DEATH OF THE WIDOW OF A FORMER U.S. SENATOR. -- A woman named Mrs. Mary Ann German died in a state of great destitution in our city yesterday morning, and is to be buried at the public expense this afternoon. Mrs. G. has lived here for several years, and is well known to many of our citizens. She endeavored, for a while after she came here, to make a living by creating and selling 'Grecian paintings,' and other fancy work, but was unable to do so, and at last became a city charge. Mrs. German related a strange story of her life. She represented that she was the widow of a former United States Senator from this State, and that at his death an estate valued at over $70,000 was taken from her on a fraudulent claim preferred by his brother. This story, and other statements made by her, were not credited, because unsupported by other evidence than her word, and the manner in which they were told and embellished. She was evidently a woman of education, and possessed traces of personal beauty in her younger days. She was the recipient of many favors from those who became acquainted with her. Her age was nearly or quite 70 years. We learn to-day that it is a fact that the deceased was the widow of Obadiah German, who resided at Norwich, Chenango County, and represented New-York in the United States Senate from 1809 to 1815. --Syracuse Journal.\\" New-York Daily Tribune, January 11, 1861, p. 3.

However, as an eclectic writer he has produced novels in several genres including science fiction, fantasy, horror, historical, children's fiction, war and literary novels (his 'Witchwater Country' was longlisted for the Booker Prize). He has also written several books of short stories and two volumes of poetry (the second with the novelist and short story writer, Robert Holdstock, with whom shared a lifelong friendship and collaboration). Garry Kilworth is now in his seventies but continues to produce novels and short stories, and has recently brought out his autobiography under the title 'On My Way To Samarkand', detailing among other things his vast travelling experiences over the globe. Kilworth is a graduate of King's College London. He has published one hundred thirty short stories and over seventy novels. His most recent books are Dragoons, a historical war novel set in South Africa, and Attica, a dark quest set in an attic the size of a continent which is currently under production with Johnny Depp's film company, Adfinitum Nihil. Recently a new collection of stories came out under the title 'The Fabulous Beast'. Kilworth has twice been shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal for children's fiction and won the Lancashire Children's Book of the Year Award for his short novel 'The Electric Kid'. Kilworth's novel Rogue Officer won the 2008 Charles Whiting Award for Historical War Literature. The Ragthorn, a novella co-authored with Robert Holdstock, won the World Fantasy Award in 1992.

The first recorded use of a palinode is in a poem by Stesichorus in the 7th century BC, in which he retracts his earlier statement that the Trojan War was all the fault of Helen.cf. Phaedrus 243a: \\"False was my tale, thou ne'er across the main/ In beauteous ships didst fly, Troy's lofty tow'rs to gain\\" An important example of a palinode is that of Socrates in the Phaedruscf. Phaedrus 244a-257b in which his first major speech disparages the \\"mania\\" of Eros and its part in human affairs, while his second one (commonly known as the palinode of Socrates) praises Eros. As he says, \\"we must not let anyone disturb us or frighten us with the claim that you should prefer a friend who is in control of himself to one who is disturbed. Besides proving that point, if [the lover of speeches] is to win his case, our opponent must show that love is not sent by the gods as a benefit to a lover and his boy. And we, for our part, must prove the opposite, that this sort of madness is given us by the gods to ensure our greatest good fortune. It will be a proof that convinces the wise if not the clever.\\"cf. Phaedrus 245b (trans. A.Nehamas and P. Woodruff) The word comes from the Greek παλινῳδία from πάλιν (palin, meaning 'back' or 'again') and ᾠδή (\\"song\\"); the Latin-derived equivalent \\"recantation\\" is an exact calque (re- meaning 'back or 'again' and cant- meaning 'sing'). It can also be a recantation of a defamatory statement in Scots Law. Examples Chaucer's Retraction is one example of a palinode. In 1895, Gelett Burgess wrote his famous poem, the Purple Cow: :I never saw a purple cow. :I never hope to see one. :But I can tell you anyhow :I'd rather see than be one. Later in his life, he followed it with this palinode: :Ah yes, I wrote the purple cow! :I’m sorry now I wrote it! :But I can tell you anyhow, :I’ll kill you if you quote it!Oxford Dictionary of Quotations p.162 Ogden Nash wrote a palinode in relation to his most famous poem about the dandiness of candy, and quickness of liquor: :Nothing makes me sicker :than liquor :and candy :is too expandy Palinodes have also been created by many medieval writers such as Augustine, Bede, Giraldus Cambrensis, Jean de Meun, Andreas Capellanus, Guittone d'Arezzo and others.

It is situated approximately four miles north-east of Thirsk. Upsall is part of the Upsall and Roxby estates owned by the Turton family. The population of the civil parish was estimated at 60 in 2014. In the 2011 census the population of the parish was included with Felixkirk, Thornbrough and North Kilvington parishes and not counted separately. History The village is mentioned in two entries of the Domesday Book as Upsale in the Yarlestre hundred. Lands at the time of the Norman invasion were in the possession of Earl Waltheof, but soon passed to the Crown from whence it was granted to Count Robert of Mortain. Some of the land was held for him by Richard of Soudeval. The lands passed to Robert de Mowbray, for whom the local Upsall family held the manor until 1327 when they were sold to Geoffrey Scrope. For a short while, the estates were Crown property before being granted to John Farnham in 1577. Thereafter, the lands passed through the Constable family to the Turtons in 1768. The name Upsall is thought to derive from the Viking Upsal-ir, meaning high dwellings or high halls. The meaning is thus identical to Uppsala in Sweden. Governance The village lies within Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Thirsk electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Whitestonecliffe ward of Hambleton District Council. The parish shares a grouped parish council, known as Hillside Parish Council, with the civil parishes of Boltby, Cowesby, Felixkirk and Kirby Knowle. Geography The nearest settlements are Knayton to the north west; Kirby Knowle to the east and Felixkirk to the south. Upsall suffered from the North Yorkshire Floods in June 2005. Nine inches of rain fell on the village in about two hours on 19 June. The consequences of such exceptional rainfall were that crops were flattened, tarmac was stripped from the roads, private properties were flood-damaged, a bridge was destroyed and tons of earth were washed from the fields and deposited on the roads. Upsall is home to a rare breed of cows called Upsall Polled Shorthorns. The herd was established in 1909 and narrowly escaped the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The National Cycle Network route 65A (Yorkshire Moors & Coast) passes through Upsall village. Religion A Wesleyan chapel was erected in the village in 1887, but is now disused. Notable buildings Upsall, The Old Forge Upsall Castle lies near the middle of the village. The 19th-century building was destroyed by fire in 1918 and rebuilt in 1922. The original Upsall castle dated from the 14th century, and was rebuilt by the Scrope family. The Legend of Upsall Castle is associated with the original castle. Upsall has some notable architecture. The old forge, with the words Upsall Town and the date 1859 inscribed above its horseshoe arch, lies in the centre of the village. Castle Farm is a Grade II listed structure and most of the buildings in Upsall are built from sandstone extracted from the old quarry. The abandoned Methodist chapel is one of the few brick-built buildings in Upsall. Nevison Hall is reputed to be the birthplace and sometime residence of the highwayman, Will Nevison, also known as Swift Nick. Folklore Upsall is one of the many locations for The Man Who Became Rich through a Dream folk tale (Aarne-Thompson type 1645). The tale tells of an Upsall man who dreamed for several nights that if he stood on London Bridge he would hear good news. He travelled to the bridge and told his story to a Londoner, who laughed, saying that he had dreamed for several nights about buried treasure located in Upsall, Yorkshire. The Upsall man returned home, and found the treasure.

The station is owned and operated by the Educational Media Foundation (EMF) and broadcasts EMF's K-Love programming. For nearly 50 years, the KNKL license was KWCR-FM, which was the radio station of Weber State University in Ogden. In 2012, a demolition of a dormitory that housed the station's transmitter and antenna forced the university to find a new location. However, the university failed to find a suitable site and KWCR became an online-only radio station in 2015. The university sold the license two years later to EMF, which moved the signal north in 2019 to cover Logan and northern Utah. As KWCR-FM =Early years= Today's KNKL began life June 6, 1966, as KWCR-FM, the student radio station of Weber State College in Ogden. (The KWCR call letters were selected to stand for \\"Weber College Radio\\".) The 10-watt outlet was based in Room 455 of the Fine Arts Center; it operated during evening hours and was entirely run by Weber State students. The June date represented a five-month delay from an originally projected launch of January 10. Prior to the launch of KWCR-FM, the lone broadcast productions of the college were a series of educational shows aired over KOET, the educational television station operated by the Ogden city school board. The station gradually grew, adding afternoon programming in 1968; during this time, it aired a \\"purple and white\\" middle-of-the-road format during the afternoon, light classical music in the evenings and educational programs after 7 p.m. Despite being on the air three years and operating 10 hours a day by 1969, however, student awareness of the radio station was low. The 1970s saw KWCR flip its schedule to air educational programming in the afternoons and music after 6 p.m. in 1971; at this time, it was the only college radio station in Utah with a national network affiliation, airing news programming from ABC. The music had also changed to a progressive rock format, and the station had begun broadcasting on Saturdays and over summer break for the first time. 90 minutes of Sunday broadcasts followed in 1973. While contents regularly varied, educational programming included news and other taped features, while the station also aired Weber State and high school sports events. However, all of this activity took place in the same studio, on an annual budget of just $500, which a staffer termed \\"sad\\". In 1974, a campus policy board censured the station for the damages left behind by a concert it sponsored, including a broken window and burn marks on the floor. KWCR did not broadcast during school breaks; in the fall of 1974, for instance, it did not resume operations until October 21, and it returned on January 13, 1975, after winter break. This changed over Christmas 1977, when the station operated through the holidays for the first time. In 1980, KWCR increased power to 130 watts; three years later, it began stereo operations and added improved equipment after the owner of Ogden commercial station KDAB donated $7,000. =New formats, more power and \\"The Beat\\"= KWCR's transmitter and antenna were relocated to Promontory Tower in 1991; the tower is visible in this 2009 photo. Promontory Tower was demolished in 2012. The station celebrated 20 years on the air in 1986, still playing largely a rock format, still largely underfunded, and facing difficulties with its aging transmitter that often kept it off the air for extended periods; as part of its anniversary events, KWCR held an on-air fund appeal for the first time. The 1986–87 school year saw preparations for a number of major changes. The studios, along with the rest of the communications department, relocated to a former annex building known as Annex 3, while work began to pursue a transmitter relocation to the Promontory Tower. In 1989, Gary Toyn, the station manager at the time, had an idea to commemorate those who died in the Tiananmen Square protests: a moment of silence on July 4 at 3:20 ET, corresponding to 4:20 a.m., when the first dissident was shot. Toyn called his friends that ran stations at UCLA and Colorado State University; before long, the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System had caught wind of the idea. Ultimately, more than 2,000 collegiate stations, as well as commercial outlets, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, participated, and Governor Norman H. Bangerter issued a proclamation. A comprehensive format revision came in 1988, when the station moved to a more consistent album-oriented rock approach from a block programming format with a heavy metal lean. A year later, however, KWCR adopted a dance-music format and the name \\"The Beat\\", a change that substantially increased interest and listenership. Unlike in the past, when call-in contests might have dragged on for hours awaiting a caller, the station's lines filled up nearly instantly. The format flip was marked with a Labor Day charitable event, titled \\"Trash the Thrash\\", in which KWCR's old heavy metal records were thrown like Frisbees. Along with the new format came 24-hour broadcasting. In its first year as The Beat, underwriting revenue exceeded that received in the previous 10 years combined. However, success did not stop disputes over the station's format, which sometimes manifested as bills in the student senate. The late 1980s and early 1990s were also spent chasing a power increase to 3,000 watts. Planned as soon as 1986, fundraising efforts included a \\"3000 Watt Dance\\" sponsored by the station. The necessary $40,000 expenditure for a new transmitter was approved by the Federal Communications Commission and school administration in 1988 only for the latter to order efforts to cease in April 1989 because it had no underwriters and was almost entirely dependent on student fees. As the existing 100-watt transmitter aged, station staff were required to throw snowballs at it to knock off the ice that formed, as the transmitter did not get warm enough to melt it in cold weather. It was not until May 1991 that KWCR relocated to Promontory Tower and activated its higher-power facilities, after two weeks off the air; the power increase attracted underwriting attention from businesses as far away as Salt Lake City and expanded the coverage of a new radio reading service subcarrier and the station's specialty programming in Spanish. The transmitter, however, was not entirely new. It had been purchased by engineering professor Bill Clapp from a man in Texas for $300 after it was struck by lightning; the equipment was being stored in his garage. With KWCR's transmitter situation settled, new problems emerged when Annex 3, which housed the communication department, was slated for demolition in 1992 because of asbestos abatement concerns. A studio move to the Shepherd Union Building was not possible in time, requiring a trailer to be rented and placed near Promontory Tower. During this time, one KWCR DJ was tapped to become the program director of KKBE-FM, a short-lived contemporary hit radio station licensed to Ogden and serving Salt Lake City; twelve former and current KWCR staffers were employed by the station in 1993, many in on-air and management positions. =The Edge and Weber FM= KWCR relocated to the Shepherd Union Building in 2008 In July 1996, after stunting, KWCR-FM returned to an alternative rock format. The station would adopt the moniker \\"The Edge\\" three years later. Another experiment with rap ended by 2001, when the station returned to an indie rock format geared toward commuting students. KWCR was also praised for its training environment and less rigidity compared to other college outlets, which often operated more like public radio stations. 2006 ushered in another major change of approach, as KWCR changed its name to \\"88.1 Weber FM\\" and adopted a rock-leaning adult contemporary format. The shift to a more mainstream sound was made, according to the general manager, to better meet the needs of students and faculty. In addition, an increase of airplay in female artists was designed to improve listenership among women. A major renovation of the Shepherd Union Building also saw KWCR displaced to the basement of the library. The new Shepherd Union studio, which opened in 2008, featured a glass-front studio, vastly improving the station's visibility on campus. However, the early 2010s featured another signal challenge for KWCR- FM. The challenge came in the form of the demolition of Promontory Tower, which had housed the transmitter and antenna since 1991, in order to build the third phase of the Wildcat Village residence hall complex. The university had opted to demolish the 44-year-old facility due to increasing upkeep costs and the building not meeting modern seismic standards. With the station about to lose its transmitter site, Weber State had filed in 2010 to relocate the station to a new tower on Mount Ogden; despite obtaining FCC approval, a contract could not be secured to use the proposed site, and in April 2012, KWCR-FM filed for special temporary authority to use a tower in Riverdale with 200 watts, which was approved and extended through the end of KWCR-FM's broadcast run. Weber State then filed to build new, permanent facilities for KWCR-FM in 2014, but the FCC dismissed the original application and an amended version, as the interfering contour of the proposed installation would have created impermissible overlap with the 60 dBu contour of adjacent-channel KCPW-FM in Salt Lake City. The inability to find a new and suitable facility that did not cause interference to KCPW-FM or other stations would be cited by the university as a factor in the end of KWCR-FM as a broadcast outlet, and ultimately, the sale of the license. =Transition to online= By 2015, KWCR had dropped the \\"Weber FM\\" name and returned to an independent rock-based sound at the start of its 50th year of broadcasting; while the station considered 2015 its 50th birthday, the station had gone on the air in 1966, not 1965. Features of KWCR in what would be its final year on FM also included its Spanish-language programming on Sundays, Domingos Latinos (Latin Sundays). Later that year, however, KWCR management opted to become an online-only radio station, effective October 30. In an advisory to listeners on its Facebook, KWCR stated the change would allow it \\"to create higher quality programming for your listening experience\\". In addition, according to KWCR staff, leaving FM, and with it FCC regulations, would allow students to make mistakes and not incur potential legal action or fines from the commission. The station handed out promo CDs—the contents of which had already been stored on station computers—to its listeners after going digital only. Sale to Educational Media Foundation and move to Tremonton Weber State University still owned the KWCR-FM license, which remained silent, with the exception of periodic broadcasts to keep the license active. On March 21, 2017, the university's trustees agreed to allow its sale. On June 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a consent decree with WSU that resolved issues related to violations of rules governing public inspection files, Emergency Alert System and station log issues raised during a review of KWCR's application for license renewal. Two people had charged that the station broadcast indecent lyrics, missed EAS tests, and violated underwriting rules for noncommercial stations. The university agreed to pay a civil penalty of $9,300. The FCC also required Weber State to sign a compliance plan, train station employees about license obligations, and conduct annual audits for three years, obligations that would be inherited by the station's buyer. The license renewal application was granted on July 12, 2017 upon tender of the civil penalty payment. Shortly before agreeing to the consent decree, Weber State University filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to sell the license to Educational Media Foundation for $100,000. Profits from the sale were put toward student scholarships. The application was granted on July 18, 2017. As the sale was pending, EMF filed an application, with Weber State's permission, to co-locate the 88.1 MHz facility with its 88.7 MHz station, KNKL. The sale to EMF was consummated on August 15, 2017, at which point the station changed its call sign to KUAO. The FCC approved the site change application on October 4; the station resumed broadcasting on October 31, broadcasting EMF's Air 1 network. On July 23, 2019, KUAO swapped call signs and networks with sister station KNKL; the newly-named KNKL began broadcasting EMF's contemporary Christian K-Love programming. The change in network coincided with the relocation of the 88.1 MHz facility from Ogden north to a new city of license, Tremonton, to serve Logan, which reduced overlap to EMF station KKLV covering metropolitan Salt Lake City. Translator KNKL has one translator serving Logan and Smithfield proper, necessary because of terrain shielding that occurs in parts of the city.

She signs herself out of the hospital, but sends a telegram telling him her name, Margo, and her address. To his surprise, he finds she lives in a mansion. He breaks a date with his nurse girlfriend, Julie (Maureen O'Sullivan), because he is worried Margo may try to commit suicide again. The doctor falls in love with Margo and they begin seeing one another. Told she is flying to Nassau with her aged father the next day, a tipsy Jeff shows up unannounced and boldly tells Frederick Lannington (Rains) that he is in love with the man's daughter. Lannington informs him that Margo is his wife. A stunned Jeff leaves despite Margo's pleas. When he hears a scream, he returns and finds her holding an earring ripped from her ear. Lannington beats Jeff with a fireplace poker; in the ensuing struggle, Cannington is knocked down and strikes his head on the floor and falls unconscious. Dazed, Jeff goes to the bathroom; when he returns, he finds the old man dead. Jeff wants to call the police, but Margo insists they would believe it was murder. Capitalizing on the fact that Jeff's judgment is impaired by his injuries, she persuades him to run away with her. They first try to use the airline tickets, but spot policemen at the ticket desk. They decide to drive to Mexico instead, taking the precaution of trading in Margo's convertible for a pickup truck provided by larcenous used car salesman \\"Honest Hal.\\" Jeff diagnoses his continuing headaches and mental fog as a concussion, warning Margo that it will lead to first paralysis of the extremities, followed by a coma within 24 to 48 hours. In Postville, Arizona, they are taken to the sheriff, but only because Jeff is not wearing a beard for the town's \\"Wild West Whiskers Week.\\" After Margo claims they are on their way to Mexico to get married, the police chief (Charles Kemper) tells them marriages are a Postville specialty and insists they get wed there. In their honeymoon suite, Margo hears a radio broadcast about them that discloses she had been undergoing psychiatric treatment. After the couple sneaks away, the police chief identifies Margo from a photo and alerts the border patrol. It is revealed that Lannington was smothered to death with a pillow. In a border town, the fugitives sell Margo's $9,000 bracelet to a pawnbroker for $1,000. Seeing they are anxious to avoid the police, he sends them to theatre owner Milo DeLong (Philip Van Zandt), who offers to smuggle them into Mexico for $1,000. As they wait, Jeff's left side becomes paralyzed. He realizes that Margo is mentally unstable and that she killed her husband; and decides not to go to Mexico. When he tries to stop Margo from leaving she knocks him down and then smothers him; however, he is only rendered unconscious. He drags himself downstairs and to the border crossing. When Margo sees him coming she pulls her pistol out of her purse and starts shooting at him. The police return fire, fatally wounding her. Before she dies, her angry last words about Jeff, witnessed by the police, reveal that he had nothing to do with her husband's murder. While recovering, Jeff asks his doctor if there is anyone he can send flowers to. The doctor says yes, steps out into the hall and sends Julie in to see him.

And thus begins a series of adventures on his flight to escape which leads him at last to realize that one should always inform the police. In this solemn demonstration, Mr. Mitchum does a fairly credible job as a man operating in a vacuum and beset by unfortunate circumstances. As the lady who gets him into trouble, Miss Domergue manifests nothing more than a comparatively sultry appearance and an ability to recite simple lines,\\" adding that director Farrow \\"has previously done better—and he'd better do so again.\\"Movie Review by Bosley Crowther, January, 1951 The New York Times. =Modern critical response= Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, \\"Director John Farrow nicely hits the nightmarish, hallucinatory qualities in this standard film noir plot: Mitchum spends the last half of the film barreling down the dirt roads of southern California with a brain concussion, passing out periodically and waking up surrounded by some of the bleakest scenery America has to offer.\\"Kehr, Dave. Film review, Chicago Reader, 1996-2008. Film critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film, especially the work of Mitchum, and wrote, \\"Robert Mitchum is cast as a stable citizen, which goes against typecast...Danger is beautifully photographed by Nick Musuraca in the dark B&W; style of noir and is ably directed by John Farrow, who successfully caught the nightmarish visions. It is interesting mostly as a character study of a capable man blinded by lust, whose life is almost destroyed. Mitchum is the innocent man who is framed and doesn't realize he is innocent until it is almost too late, recovering in the nick of time because he has such a strong character and will to live. Mitchum's convincing portrayal of the innocent man on the run, is what makes this melodrama compelling...The movie plays like a noir cliché. But Mitchum saves the day, realistically showing how a swell guy and such a competent doctor could be so vulnerable. Claude Rains as always is magnificent, in a small part but one where his every gesture seems to be constrained in a maniacal rage ready to burst open. His touch of madness is best exemplified by his mischievous smile while meeting his wife's lover.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, November 17, 2000. Last accessed: August 28, 2008. British film critic Neil Young wrote, \\"Though inexplicably little-known these days, Where Danger Lives is an absolutely cracking little film noir with an appealingly absurd screwball edge. The main credit for which presumably belongs not to director Farrow (father of Mia), but to veteran scriptwriter Charles Bennett - whose screenplays for Hitchcock included The 39 Steps, Young and Innocent and Foreign Correspondent, and later wrote Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon.\\"Young, Neil.

They derived the term from the Aztec who referred to the nomadic tribes of the area as “chichimeca”. The Nahuatl name Chīchīmēcah (plural, ; singular Chīchīmēcatl) means \\"inhabitants of Chichiman\\"; the placename Chichiman itself means \\"Area of Milk\\". It is sometimes said to be related to chichi \\"dog\\", but the i's in chichi are short while those in Chīchīmēcah are long, a phonemic distinction in Nahuatl.See for example Andrews (2003), pp.496, 507.

Seventy years after the 1521 fall of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City), the Spaniards had failed to subdue the north of New Spain, La Gran Chichimeca. This meant they were unable to exploit the rich silver deposits in the region. The Spanish, who were unable to defeat the Chichimecas militarily, were forced to make \\"peace by purchase\\" by offering them land, farming tools and other goods in exchange for peace.http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/zacatecas.html (See Chichimeca War) During the 1920s and 1930s archaeologists, anthropologists, and cultural geographers began to devise the boundaries of what was thought to be Mesoamerica, the Southwest, and the area between known as the La Gran Chichimeca. Based upon language groups, iconography, trade items, and re- examinations of Mesoamerican architecture, the boundaries have moved around over the years as a result of new evidence. Adding to this confusion not all researchers agree the specifics of the boundaries. However, the participation of the cultures of La Gran Chichimeca in overall Mesoamerican traditions, even if peripherally and occasionally, has led a number of researchers to include the region in the overall Mesoamerican framework.

Early life and early career Petro was born October 25, 1948 in Brooklyn, Ohio. A Brooklyn High School graduate, he attended Denison University in Granville, Ohio where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree and joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He later earned his J.D. degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio. Petro served as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for Franklin County as a trial lawyer responsible for felony prosecutions, and then as Assistant Director of Law for the city of Cleveland, Ohio. After starting his private practice, Petro became prosecuting attorney for the city of Rocky River, Ohio. Political career Petro began his political career in 1977 when he was elected to the Rocky River city council, and later served as the director of the city. In 1980, he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. He served four years as a state representative. In 1991, Petro became County Commissioner for Cuyahoga County; during his four-year term he was President of the board for a year. Petro was elected Ohio Auditor in 1994 and re-elected in 1998, serving two terms from 1995 to 2003. As Auditor he served as the chief inspector and supervisor of public offices in the state; the office is the largest state auditing agency in the United States, second in size only to the United States Government Accountability Office. In November 2002, Petro was elected the Ohio attorney general, serving from 2003 to 2007. In 2005, Petro became the first Ohio attorney general to argue a case in front of the United States Supreme Court in over thirty years; he won the case by a vote of nine to zero. As Ohio's Attorney General he successfully defended the law banning late term abortions in the state. As attorney general, Petro also launched an effort that added 210,000 criminal DNA profiles from Ohio to the national Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Candidate for Governor On January 30, 2006, Petro announced that Joy Padgett would be his running mate for the Governor's position. Padgett, a Republican state senator from Coshocton, Ohio, was selected after Petro's first running mate, Hamilton County Commissioner Phil Heimlich, dropped out of the campaign to run for re- election as Commissioner of Hamilton County. Petro was defeated in the May 2, 2006 primary by Ken Blackwell, Ohio's then-Secretary of State. Legal Work and \\"False Justice\\" Petro became the first attorney general in the country to intervene in a case spearheaded by the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal clinic that pioneered the use of DNA testing to prove wrongful conviction. The case exonerated Clarence Elkins, a family man with no prior criminal record who had been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his mother-in-law. After his involvement in subsequent high-profile cases including Dean Gillispie. Petro and his wife Nancy co-authored \\"False Justice: Eight Myths that Convict the Innocent,\\" which raises questions regarding the fairness of our justice system and identifies flaws in how police and prosecutors handle evidence, especially in capital cases. The book also examines how the authors believe DNA evidence has played a critical role in exonerating convicted people and highlight what the authors call the unreliability of eyewitness testimony.

Shock diamonds (also known as Mach diamonds or thrust diamonds) are a formation of standing wave patterns that appear in the supersonic exhaust plume of an aerospace propulsion system, such as a supersonic jet engine, rocket, ramjet, or scramjet, when it is operated in an atmosphere. The \\"diamonds\\" are actually a complex flow field made visible by abrupt changes in local density and pressure as the exhaust passes through a series of standing shock waves and expansion fans. Mach diamonds are named after Ernst Mach, the physicist who first described them. Mechanism Shock diamonds behind a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. F-16 taking off with afterburner Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 engine test at NASA's Stennis Space Center An F-22 Raptor with shock diamonds behind it Shock diamonds form when the supersonic exhaust from a propelling nozzle is slightly over-expanded, meaning that the static pressure of the gases exiting the nozzle is less than the ambient air pressure. The higher ambient pressure compresses the flow, and since the resulting pressure increase in the exhaust gas stream is adiabatic, a reduction in velocity causes its static temperature to be substantially increased. The exhaust is generally over-expanded at low altitudes, where air pressure is higher. As the flow exits the nozzle, ambient air pressure will compress the flow. The external compression is caused by oblique shock waves inclined at an angle to the flow. The compressed flow is alternately expanded by Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans, and each \\"diamond\\" is formed by the pairing of an oblique shock with an expansion fan. When the compressed flow becomes parallel to the center line, a shock wave perpendicular to the flow forms, called a normal shock wave or Mach disk. The first shock diamond is located here, and the space between it and the nozzle is called the \\"zone of silence\\". The distance from the nozzle to the first shock diamond can be approximated by x = 0.67 D_0\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{P_0}{P_1}}, where x is the distance, D0 is the nozzle diameter, P0 is flow pressure, and P1 is atmospheric pressure. As the exhaust passes through the normal shock wave, its temperature increases, igniting excess fuel and causing the glow that makes the shock diamonds visible. The illuminated regions either appear as disks or diamonds, giving them their name. Eventually the flow expands enough so that its pressure is again below ambient, at which point the expansion fan reflects from the contact discontinuity (the outer edge of the flow). The reflected waves, called the compression fan, cause the flow to compress. If the compression fan is strong enough, another oblique shock wave will form, creating a second Mach disk and shock diamond. The pattern of disks and diamonds would repeat indefinitely if the gases were ideal and frictionless; however, turbulent shear at the contact discontinuity causes the wave pattern to dissipate with distance. Diamond patterns can similarly form when a nozzle is under-expanded (exit pressure higher than ambient), in lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. In this case, the expansion fan is first to form, followed by the oblique shock. Alternative sources Shock diamonds beneath Masten Space Systems Xoie rocket during the Lunar Lander Challenge competition-winning landing. Shock diamonds are most commonly associated with jet and rocket propulsion, but they can form in other systems. =Natural gas pipeline blowdowns= Shock diamonds can be seen during gas pipeline blowdowns because the gas is under high pressure and exits the blowdown valve at extreme speeds. =Artillery= When artillery pieces are fired, gas exits the cannon muzzle at supersonic speeds and produces a series of shock diamonds. The diamonds cause a bright muzzle flash which can expose the location of gun emplacements to the enemy. It was found that when the ratio between the flow pressure and atmospheric pressure is close, the shock diamonds were greatly minimized. Adding a muzzle brake to the end of the muzzle balances the pressures and prevents shock diamonds. =Radio jets= Some radio jets, powerful jets of plasma that emanate from quasars and radio galaxies, are observed to have regularly-spaced knots of enhanced radio emissions. The jets travel at supersonic speed through a thin \\"atmosphere\\" of gas in space, so it is hypothesized that these knots are shock diamonds.

The game is set in the early 20th century, between the two World Wars, and affectionately parodies the character and attitudes of the later British Empire. Plot From the blurb on the game box: :Disaster looms for the bowler and brolly brigade. The contemptible COUNT CHAMELEON, Master of Disguise and sworn enemy of the establishment, is determined to succeed in his latest and greatest dastardly plot. His sale of rubber goods through mail-order ads in a civil service magazine, has led him to develop the RUBBERTRONIC RAY. With it he threatens to neutralise the starch in wind-collars, loosen stiff upper lips and generally relax moral standards - leading to the collapse of The Empire. Worse still, it will radically and unpredictably alter the bounce of a cricket ball. This bounder must be stopped! Gameplay Gameplay is in the form of a graphic adventure with the player controlling four different characters: Viscount Sebastian Stifflip, Miss Palmyra Primbottom, Professor Braindeath and Colonel R. G. Bargie. The characters and their environment are presented in a comic strip format on-screen with the player controlling them via a mixture of icons and point-and-click options (albeit controlled by a keyboard and joystick rather than a mouse). The four different characters all have different skills and so only certain characters can solve certain puzzles. For example, anything requiring scientific knowledge requires Professor Braindeath to deal with it.

Sinderby is located 223 miles (358.8 km) north of London and 48 miles (77.2 km) south of Durham, just east of the A1(M) motorway offering road links to larger cities such as Leeds, London and the Channel Ports. It has a population of 142 people according to the 2001 census, reducing to 137 at the 2011 census and is part of the district of Hambleton. Village The village of Sinderby is a rural community, consisting of mainly residential housing with detached and semi detached housing, as well as small companies and farms, such as Manor Farm; an egg merchants. It also comprises a village hall which resides beside the village green which dates back from the 1990s, and there is a Post Office in the village. History The parish had a small Wesleyan chapel that was built in 1835, and in a field called chapel field, adjoining the village of Sinderby, there have been signs and indications of there being a chapel in 1848. Old parishes tended to form at a time when there were little difference between the church and the state according to the local people. Sinderby was a township up until 1866 when it became a civil parish, much like many townships that around the same time either became included into other civil parishes, or created their own. In 1590, an estate of 21 acres of land was given to the All Saints church located in Pickhill, thought to be erected some 700 years prior to 1890, and it was restored in 1877 at a cost of £3,000. Sinderby was part of the Pickhill parish in 1890, along with other townships including Roxby, Ainderby-Quernhow, Holme, Howe and Swainby-with-Allerthope. It comprises 542 acres of land which was chiefly owned by Mr. William Dunning, Mrs. M. Hammond and Miss. M. Kendrew.

Upon its opening the station had two employees who were Henry Bell who was the stationmaster, and Jas Elliot who worked as a porter. On 1 January 1962 the station was closed to passengers, and little under two years later on 11 November 1963 the station was closed completely. From December 2002 a number of British Railways Mark 2 coaches were stored behind the station for a period of time unused, and this evolved into the famous \\"Sinderby train graveyard\\" until they were removed in 2009 before the widening of the A1 road. Demographics =Population= Population changes in the parish of Sinderby between 1881 and 2001 The first recorded census of Sinderby occurred in 1881 with the population being 114 people. A census was carried out every ten years up until 1961, offering information on such statistics as total population, population change, gender and area over the time the census has been carried out. The population in the parish stayed roughly the same until 1911 when it drastically decreased to 92 people, possibly being due to the First World War. This fluctuation appeared again between 1931 and 1961, with the census data showing the population in 1931 being 107 people and then rapidly declining up until 1961 when the population was as low as 80 people according to census records. There are no census records from 1941 due to the Second World War. From 1961 onwards the census data changed, listing the information gathered in some places by wards and no longer by parishes. According to the 2001 census, the headcount of the parish of Sinderby was 142 people, and the male:female ratio is split almost perfectly, with there being 70 males and 72 females residing in 55 households. The parish consists of mainly families, with 31 people being aged between 5–15 years old and 49 people aged between 25–44 years old. =Occupation structure= Occupation data for Sinderby in 1881 The 1881 census on inhabitants occupations provides information on what occupational category the population of Sinderby fall into. The data shows that the large proportion of males worked in agriculture, with 13 of the 31 males falling into this category. The rest of the male population were employed across a variety of different jobs, including transport, food and lodging and animals. In contrast, almost all females were without specific occupations, with 25 of the 31 being part of this category. However, a small minority of the female population worked in domestic services or office work. In 2001 the number of people employed was 98, with 76 of these people being economically active. Over half of those employed are males, and the average distance travelled to work is around 25 km, showing how it is necessary for them to migrate to more urban areas in search of work. Transport =Road= Sinderby is accessible through a range of lanes such as Sinderby Lane, Lime Lane and Westfield Lane that connect to the A1(M) motorway and the B6267 offering access to the parish by car.

Feathersmith, the 75-year-old president of a large corporation, is a sadistic man who has made his fortune by financially preying on others. One night, a drunken Feathersmith confesses to the janitor Mr. Hecate, that, having reached the height of success, he is left feeling empty and purposeless, and dreams of returning to his small hometown of Cliffordville, Indiana, to start life anew. Hecate says that Cliffordville happens to be his hometown as well. Attempting to go home for the night, Feathersmith is instead taken by the elevator to the 13th floor, where he finds a travel agency that was not there the day before. Feathersmith quickly realizes that the agency's head, Miss Devlin, is the devil. She offers to fulfill his wish to return to 1910 Cliffordville, agreeing to his terms that he will look the same as he did then, but retain all memories of his first life, in exchange for almost all his liquidated worth, leaving him with $1,412. Because he knows which investments have succeeded and which have failed in the last 50 years, Feathersmith agrees. Back in 1910 Cliffordville, he uses $1,403 to buy 1,403 acres of land which he knows to contain deposits of oil. He forgets, however, that the drill needed to access oil so far beneath the ground will not be invented until 1937. Feathersmith tries to woo the daughter of a bank owner but is startled that, rather than being the charming girl he remembers, she chatters incessantly and insists on entertaining guests with her shrill singing. Many of the stocks he invests in drop. He tries to \\"invent\\" devices such as a self-starter for automobiles, but does not know how to design them. The townspeople ridicule this, which causes Feathersmith to suffer palpitations. He realizes that following the strict letter of his terms, Miss Devlin has made him appear 30, but he is still biologically 75. Miss Devlin appears. Feathersmith accuses her of altering the past, but she says that all is as it was; he just chose to remember it differently. She needles him that he has lived off the work of others and is unable to create anything himself. He pleads with Miss Devlin to send him back to 1963, even after she warns him that his actions in 1910 have changed things, and it can no longer be the 1963 he knew. Feeling some measure of sympathy for him, she agrees to fulfill his wish for just $40. Having no money left, Feathersmith hastily sells the deed to his land to Mr. Hecate for the $40, and leaves 1910 Cliffordville in disgrace. In an altered 1963, Mr. Hecate is now the president of the corporation, having founded it with his oil profits earned after 1937. A cold and extremely self-centered man, Hecate mocks Feathersmith for having been a janitor for 44 years, while the now- powerless Feathersmith can only stand there and take the ridicule, just as Hecate did in his place. Closing narration Production In the scene in which Feathersmith negotiates his way out of Cliffordville, there are several crates in the alley marked \\"This End Up\\", which were used as shipping crates for the wax figures in the previous episode, \\"The New Exhibit\\".

It is based in Beasain, Basque Autonomous Community. Equipment manufactured by Grupo CAF includes light rail vehicles, rapid transit trains, railroad cars and locomotives, as well as variable gauge axles that can be fitted on any existing truck or bogie. Over the 20 years from the early 1990s, CAF benefited from the rail investment boom in its home market in Spain to become a world player with a broad technical capability, able to manufacture almost any type of rail vehicle. CAF has supplied railway rolling stock to a number of major urban transit operators around Europe, the US, South America, East Asia, India, Australia and North Africa. History Bucharest Metro trains, built between 2013 and 2014 CAF was an acronym for the earlier name of Compañía Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, as well as for Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles. =Fábrica de Hierros San Martín= In 1860 Domingo Goitia, Martín Usabiaga and José Francisco Arana established this company, whose main activity was puddling furnaces and cylinder rolling. =La Maquinista Guipuzcoana= In 1892 Francisco de Goitia (Domingo Goitia's son and heir) joined the Marquess of Urquijo to set up La Maquinista Guipuzcoana, whose main activity was the operation of machinery and the forging and construction of railway rolling stock. In 1898 it set up its plant in Beasain, Gipuzkoa. In 1905 it changed its name to Fábrica de Vagones de Beasain (FVB). =Compañía Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles= Compañía Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) was founded in 1917, specializing in freight car production and with a total of 1,600 employees. In 1940 the Irun factory was set up, following the expansion of activity after the Spanish Civil War (CAF took part in reconstructing the Spanish rail fleet). In 1954 CAF took over Material Móvil y Construcciones (MMC) from Zaragoza (Aragon), a company with extensive experience in manufacturing long-distance and subway trains. Since 1958 the company has modernized and enlarged its Beasain plant and expanded its activity to include all kinds of rolling stock. In line with this, in 1969 CAF created its Research and Development Unit, which increased the company's competitiveness and intensified the focus on in-house technology. =Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles= In 1971 the existing Compañía Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) merged with Material Móvil y Construcciones (MMC) and the company adopted its current name Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles. Subsidiaries CAF U.S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of CAF, was incorporated in 1998 and is based in Elmira, New York. It manufactures rolling stock for the North American market at a plant in Elmira that the company acquired from ADtranz in 2000. The company from Beasain continued its expansion during the third millennium. On 24 May 2019, it announced the acquisition of the Swedish company Euromaint at a cost of circa € 80 million, following other international contracts to supply Flemish and English railway and underground networks in 2017. CAF Rolling Stock U.K. Ltd. is the CAF subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Its factory is based at Celtic Springs Business Park, at Llanwern steelworks near Newport, Wales as a result of an agreement made between CAF and the Welsh Government. The Newport factory will build stock for Transport for Wales, Northern, the Docklands Light Railway, and potentially High Speed 2 if CAF win the bid process.

She was married to journalist Heywood Broun and was an associate of the Algonquin Round Table. Hale was the founder of the Lucy Stone League, an organization whose motto was \\"My name is the symbol for my identity and must not be lost.\\" Hale's cause led her to fight for women to be able to legally preserve their maiden names after marriage. She challenged in the courts any government edict that would not recognize a married woman by the name she chose to use. Early life Hale was born in Rogersville, Tennessee in 1887. (Her younger brother, Richard Hale, also born in the town, later became a singer and then a longtime Hollywood character actor.) At age 13, she entered the Hollins Institute (today Hollins University) in Roanoke, Virginia. Three years later, she left to attend Drexel Academy of Fine Art (today Drexel University) in Philadelphia, where she studied painting and sculpture, but writing was her true calling. Career in journalism When Hale was 18, she became a journalist in Washington, DC, writing for the Hearst syndicate. She was a sought-after writer and socialite, and attended parties at the White House when President Woodrow Wilson was in office. She worked at the Washington Post until she went back to Philadelphia to become drama critic for the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Hale also dabbled in sports writing, which was uncommon for women to do at the time. Hale moved to New York City about 1915 and became a feature writer for The New York Times, Vogue and Vanity Fair. Hale also did a bit of acting, appearing on Broadway three times in her life. Marriage and family Hale was introduced to Heywood Broun, a popular newspaper columnist and sportswriter, at a New York Giants baseball game at the Polo Grounds. They were married on 6 June 1917. When Broun was sent to France to report on the war, Hale went with him, writing for the Paris edition of the Chicago Tribune. In 1918, Hale gave birth to her only child, Heywood Hale Broun, in New York City. Women's rights and other activism Early in 1921 Hale took a stand with the U.S. State Department, demanding that she be issued a passport as \\"Ruth Hale\\", not as \\"Mrs. Heywood Broun\\". The government refused; no woman had been given a passport with her maiden name to that time. She was unable to cut through the red tape, and the government issued her passport reading \\"Ruth Hale, also known as Mrs. Heywood Broun.\\" She refused to accept the passport, and cancelled her trip to France, as did her husband. In May 1921, Hale was believed to be the first married woman to be issued a real estate deed in her own name for an apartment house on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Not long afterward, she was chosen to be president of the Lucy Stone League, a group she founded based on Lucy Stone's decision to keep her maiden name after marriage. The group also chose Rose Falls Bres to serve as its legal counsel. Mrs. Bres, soon to be named president of the National Association of Women Lawyers, had been Hale's lawyer during her battle with the State Department. Heywood Broun was among the men present, and supported his wife in her endeavors. Other Lucy Stoners were Jane Grant, wife of Harold Ross, the founder of The New Yorker, and Beatrice Kaufman, wife of playwright George S. Kaufman. Hale and Broun bought a farm in Stamford, Connecticut, but resided in separate homes. She started to spend more time on women’s rights causes and less time on journalism. In August 1927, Hale took a leading role in protesting the executions of anarchists and accused murderers Sacco and Vanzetti. She traveled to Boston as part of the defense committee, along with Dorothy Parker and John Dos Passos. The men were put to death over their fierce protests. The campaign had a galvanizing effect on her, leading her to fight against capital punishment. In 1929 Edward Bernays decided to pay women to smoke their “torches of freedom” as they walked in the Easter Sunday Parade in New York. This was a shock because until that time, women were only permitted to smoke in certain places such as in the privacy of their own homes. He was very careful when picking women to march because “while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y” and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world. Hale called for women to join in the march saying, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!”Brandt, Allan M. (2007). The Cigarette Century. New York: Basic Books, pp. 84-85. Later life and death While Hale was intelligent, fearless, and honest, she was frustrated throughout her life by her physical unattactiveness and her too- earnest, often hectoring style. The writer and lawyer Newman Levy, a longtime friend of Hale and Broun, recalled a bitter exchange between Hale and an unidentified person. Adversary: \\"The trouble with you, Ruth, is that you have no sense of humor.\\" Hale: \\"Thank God I am not cursed with the albatross of a sense of humor.\\" During the 1920s and 1930s, Hale continued to write, reviewed books for the Brooklyn Eagle, and worked as a theatrical press agent. She was a leading figure in New York’s writer’s community, and, with her husband, she was an associate of the Algonquin Round Table at the Algonquin Hotel. Hale and Broun were quietly divorced in Mexico in November 1933, although the two remained close and continued to reside on the same property in Connecticut. Ten months later, in September 1934, Hale came down with an intestinal fever at her home in Stamford. Broun rushed his former wife to Doctor's Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, but it was too late. She died on September 18 at age 47. She was buried in her hometown of Rogersville, Tennessee. Film portrayal Hale was portrayed by the actress Jane Adams in the 1994 film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.Internet Movie Database entry for Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle References =Bibliography= *Dale Kramer, Heywood Broun, a Biographical Portrait, New York: Current Books, 1949. *Heywood Hale Broun, Whose Little Boy Are You?

The town is surrounded by the Municipality of Bifrost - Riverton and has a population of 1,222 as of the Canada 2016 Census.  History of Arborg  Arborg CPR Station The picturesque setting along the Icelandic River was first settled in the late 19th century. Its first postal address was Ardal (Icelandic Árdalur, meaning \\"River Valley\\"), but in 1910 when the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the settlement, the name was changed to Arborg (Árborg, meaning \\"River Town\\"). The original railway station from 1910 still stands and is today recognized as a heritage site. The building has been converted into a public library. Icelanders established homesteads to the east, west, north, and south of the village, and by 1908 the first Polish and Ukrainian settlers had arrived in the area. The coming of the railroad brought large numbers of Ukrainians who settled throughout the district along with groups from other European countries. This mixture gave Arborg a rich cultural diversity and its own distinct character. The many different churches, the ethnic foods and the social activities are all evidence of the cultural complexity of the town. Arborg & District Multicultural Heritage Village The Arborg & District Multicultural Heritage Village is a working open-air museum and interpretive centre located just outside the town on Highway 68, on the south side of the Icelandic River. It preserves and showcases the multicultural history of the area. The very first building, the Trausti Vigfusson house, was moved on site by a team of horses, commemorating the community spirit that built the area in the early 1900s. This log house was built around 1898 and originally stood in Lundi (today Riverton). Vigfusson, its original owner and builder, transported it to the nearby Geysir settlement in 1902. The Arborg & District Multicultural Heritage Village is a community concept envisioned to promote and preserve for tomorrow those memories of the past. The Heritage Village had its grand opening May 24, 2008. To date a hall, church, caboose, outdoor bake oven and three houses have been completed. A school has been moved on the site and is currently awaiting restoration along with a foreman's rail car. Two Ukrainian log houses, a windmill as well as numerous farm equipment and artifacts have been added to the village in 2010.  Water  The Town's Water Treatment Plant received funds for a C$400,000 upgrade in 2017. The project also included replacement of some piping. World's largest curling rock Arborg is also home to the world's largest curling rock, which measures across and tall. Unlike an actual curling rock however, it is constructed with steel, foam, and fiberglass, with most of the weight consisting in the steel support beams. Notable person *James Reimer, goaltender for the Carolina Hurricanes. Climate Arborg has a similar summer to other prairie cities with an August high of 23.6C, compared with 22.5C in Calgary or 24.4C in Saskatoon.

It was founded in 2002. The school held its first graduation of seniors on June 7, 2005. From 2007 to 2015, U.S. News and World Report recognized the school with a silver award in its Best High Schools 2008-2015 list. In 2013, Evergreen Valley received a clear six year accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. History Evergreen Valley High School opened in 2002 on the \\"Small School\\" concept, with an emphasis on technology and the idea that every student would have a laptop to take home for doing homework. The school opened initially with only two grade levels: freshmen and sophomores. It existed as a single high school, with four mostly independent schools within it: Science & Technology, Global Economy, Human Performance, and Humanities. The first year EVHS was open, Science & Technology and Human Performance students received IBM Notebooks, while Global Economy and Humanities Students received Apple iBooks. In Fall 2002, the campus was still unfinished, so classes took place in portables on two nearby campuses: Silver Creek High School and Mount Pleasant High School. S&T; and HU were situated at Silver Creek, while HP and GE were situated in Mt. Pleasant.School Accountability Report Card for EVHS, 2003-2004 The EVHS campus officially was open for attendance in January 2003. Administration tended to be unhelpful in teachers' and students' requests for aid, although they themselves were also swamped with the task of managing a brand new school. In January 2004, petitions circulated after enrollment at Evergreen Valley quickly approached its limit of 1,800: one calling for shrunken boundaries and another for expansion. On March 11, 2004, district trustees voted to construct a new building on campus to ease overcrowding. In 2006, construction began for the building. In July 2004, the San Jose Mercury News profiled the use of the Xanga blog site by EVHS students. Principals existed for all of the schools, and were supervised by a primary principal. However, due to change in district leadership and issues with funding and philosophy, in February 2004, the small school system was done away with, and the high school adopted a traditional format, which it has kept until the present. The Class of 2006, the first class of students to have attended the school since its opening year in 2002, graduated on June 7, 2006. Several troubling instances occurred on one week in March 2009; overnight between March 14 and 15, a 20-foot swastika was etched on a lawn that had also been salted earlier, and several trees were cut down. Then on March 17, an envelope was mailed to school containing a suspicious white powder and a letter expressing dissatisfaction over the school's dress code policy regarding hats. This led to the administrative building being evacuated, but an investigation revealed that the substance was merely baby powder. Following rumors spread over the Internet that a shooting would occur that day, a majority of the student body did not show up to class on March 20\\\\. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and San Jose Police Department began a probe into these incidents immediately. Academics Evergreen Valley High School achieved APIs of 663 in 2011, 665 in 2013, and 666 in 2015. =Biotech Academy= Geared towards relieving the overcrowding at Evergreen Valley High School, the Biotech Academy existed from 2004–06 in portables at the campus of Evergreen Valley College in August 2004, offering a \\"small school\\" environment (similar to EVHS's original blueprint) as well as a focus on biotechnology and the opportunity to take more advanced classes, including college classes.EVHS newsletter - Aug. 23, 2004 Laptops and smaller classes were also promised, and delivered after half a year. Students attending the Biotech Academy were still eligible to participate in extracurricular clubs, leadership programs, sports, and activities at Evergreen Valley High School. However, the academy was closed in 2006 due to budget cuts and declining interest.

It is situated close to the River Swale, west of Northallerton. Thrintoft is mentioned in the Domesday Book as being in the possession of Picot of Lascelles. One of his descendants, Roger de Lascelles, gifted the village to St Mary's Abbey in York around 1146. The name derives from Old Norse and is registered in the Domesday Book as Tirnetofte. It is believed to mean the thorn-bush by (or in) the field. Chapel of Saint Mary Magdalen Historically in the parish of Ainderby Steeple, which lies to the south, it became its own parish in 1866 and now contains the hamlet of Little Langton. Whilst the parish has a population of 185, North Yorkshire County Council estimated that the population of the village was 140 at the 2011 census and remained at that number in 2015. The village is recorded as having a corn mill in 1539, which led to the stream flowing south west through the settlement into the River Swale being named Mill Beck. The chapel of St Mary Magdalen, now a barn, was built during the 13th to 15th centuries. It was endowed in 1253 as a chantry chapel connected to Jervaulx Abbey and is a grade II* listed building. The chapel is the only surviving building from Thrintoft Grange. The village has a pub, The New Inn.

Lech with her bassist and husband Marius Reksjø, after having been encouraged to make a record by Bugge Wesseltoft at Jazzland Recordings.  Biography  Lech and Reksjø studied music together at the University of Oslo, and as music students they started several bands together. Their music flows in the landscape between jazz and acid-jazz, using upbeat and downbeat electronica roots, using vocal harmonies, piano, and strings. However, the music also incorporates elements of several other genres. From 2003, things really start to happen, both commercially and critically, and now Beady Belle is an internationally known band. After a concert in London during a European tour in 2005, the UK jazz performer Jamie Cullum came backstage to talk with the band. That meeting sparked a big tour over UK and some concerts in Germany, France, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, with Beady Belle as Cullum's supporting act. In 2008, they appeared at the Calgary Jazz Festival in Canada. The original band split up in 2015 but vocalist and songwriter Beate S. Lech has since released two albums under the name Beady Belle.

A complex mix of commercial signs make up the view's background. Visual pollution is an aesthetic issue and refers to the impacts of pollution that impair one's ability to enjoy a pleasant view. Visual pollution disturbs the visual areas of people by creating harmful changes in the natural environment. Billboards, open storage of trash, antennas, electric wires, buildings, and automobiles are often considered visual pollution. An overcrowding of an area causes visual pollution. Visual pollution is defined as the whole of irregular formations, which are mostly found in nature. Effects of exposure to visual pollution include distraction, eye fatigue, decreases in opinion diversity, and loss of identity. It has also been shown to increase biological stress responses and impair balance.  Sources  Artificial tree to hide a mobile phone base station Local managers of urban areas sometimes lack control over what is built and assembled in public places. As businesses look for ways to increase the profits, cleanliness, architecture, logic and use of space in urban areas are suffering from visual clutter. Variations in the built environment are determined by the location of street furniture such as public transport stations, garbage cans, large panels and stalls. Insensitivity of local administration is another cause for visual pollution. For example, poorly planned buildings and transportation systems create visual pollution. High-rise buildings, if not planned properly or sufficiently, can bring adverse change to the visual and physical characteristics of a city, which may reduce said city's readability. A frequent criticism of advertising is that there is too much of it. Billboards, for example, have been alleged to distract drivers, corrupt public taste, promote meaningless and wasteful consumerism and clutter the land. See highway beautification. However, with the introduction of new communication technologies, the fragmentation and incentive nature of advertising methods will improve, reducing clutter. Thus, with the increase of mobile device usage, more money goes to advertising on social media websites and mobile apps. Vandalism, in the form of graffiti is defined as street markings, offensive, inappropriate, and tasteless messages made without the owner's consent. Graffiti adds to visual clutter as it disturbs the view.  Prevention  = United States= In the United States, there are several initiatives gradually taking place to prevent visual pollution. The Federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965 limits placement of billboards on Interstate highways and federally aided roads. It has dramatically reduced the amount of billboards placed on these roads. Another highway bill, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 has made transportation facilities sync with the needs of communities. This bill created a system of state and national scenic byways and provided funds for biking trails, historic preservation and scenic conservation. Businesses situated near an interstate can create problems of advertising through large billboards, however now an alternative solution for advertisers is gradually eliminating the problem. For example, logo signs that provide directional information for travelers without disfiguring the landscape are increasing and are a step toward decreasing visual pollution on highways in America. = Brazil = In September 2006, São Paulo passed the Cidade Limpa (Clean City Law), outlawing the use of all outdoor advertisements, including on billboards, transit, and in front of stores.

Range and habitat This solitaire ranges from southern Alaska, British Columbia and Alberta to northern Zacatecas in Mexico, preferring montane woodlands. During winter, it may move in search of food to lower elevations, including the Great Plains, northern interior Mexico, and even desert oases. Description Townsend's solitaire feeding on juniper berries Myadestes townsendi, Ashland, Oregon, June 2014 Townsend's solitaire reaches a length of approximately 8–9.5 inches (20–24 cm) and wingspan of 14.5 in (37 cm); it weighs approximately 1.2 oz (34 g). It has a short, thick, blackish bill; a white eye ring; and gray plumage with a buffy wing stripe and edges of the flight feathers. The tail is long, tapered when shut, and edged with white. Juveniles are mottled gray and white. It perches in a rather upright position, often high on a branch and often staying still for a long time. Though it has some similarities to the northern mockingbird, particularly as to the tail, its dark underparts, shape, size, and behavior are not similar. It feeds primarily on berries and insects. The solitaire is amongst the most specialized of all North American birds since its diet in winter consists almost entirely of the fleshy cones of the juniper bush, and the solitary birds form territories around productive juniper patches which they strongly defend Bock, C. 1982. Factors influencing winter distribution and abundance of Townsend's Solitaire. Wilson Bulletin 94: 297-302 =Voice= Its song consists of loud, melodious flute-like rising and falling phrases with \\"low, husky notes interspersed but no distinct pattern\\" and \\"a slightly mechanical quality.\\" The call is a squeaky eeek or \\"clear, soft whistle heeh\\". Nesting The nest resembles that of other solitaires: a cup of fine plant material on or close to the ground. Townsend's solitaire usually lays three or four eggs that are grayish-white with brown dots or splotches concentrated at the larger end.

It is also the highest point of the Panamint Range, and lies in Inyo County. From atop this desert mountain one can see for over one hundred miles in many directions, including west to Mount Whitney, and east to Charleston Peak. The mountain was named for the great distance visible from the summit. Geography left of the highest apparent peak in the image) Telescope Peak is also notable for having one of the greatest vertical rises above local terrain of any mountain in the contiguous United States. Its summit rises above the lowest point in Death Valley, Badwater Basin at , in about , and about above the floor of Panamint Valley in about .Southern California Atlas and Gazetteer, DeLorme Mapping, 1990. This is comparable to the rises of other tall, but better known, U.S. peaks. It is even somewhat comparable to the rise of Mount Everest above its northern base on the Tibetan Plateau, a rise of roughly . However Everest rises much more, and much more steeply, above its southern base in Nepal.Mount Everest (topographic map, second edition), National Geographic Society/Boston Museum of Science/Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Bradford Washburn, project director, 1991. Since it is the high point of a range surrounded by low basins, Telescope Peak also has a particularly high topographic prominence of , ranking it 22nd in the contiguous US by that measure. A variety of trees can be found on the mountain, including single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), limber pine (Pinus flexilis), and, at the highest elevations, the ancient Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). Climbing From Ridgecrest, California State Route 178 leads northeast into Death Valley National Park. The road turns to unpaved about later as it loses its highway status. It winds up through Wildrose Canyon up to a parking lot where the trail for the summit starts. The section from the Charcoal Kilns can be rough and might only be suitable for 4-wheel-drive cars with high clearance, depending on weather conditions. Badwater Basin from Mahogany Flat trail Hiking Telescope Peak by the normal route involves a round trip hike. The trail starts in the western part of Death Valley National Park at Mahogany Flat campground. The trail slowly winds itself up to the summit later at a steady gradient of roughly 8%. The standard route is maintained by the National Park Service, and no permit is required to climb the mountain. This route leaves directly from the Mahogany Flat Campground, and travels approximately two miles to Arcane Meadows. From Arcane Meadows, the trail winds five more miles gradually up toward Telescope Peak, mostly following the ridgeline to the summit. This route can also be used to access two nearby peaks, Bennett Peak and Rogers Peak, a traverse that adds on minimal extra mileage. An established, but more advanced, climbing route is from Shorty's Well (elevation around ) to the summit of Telescope Peak at . This route is approximately 30 to 34 miles round trip and provides a net gain of elevation of approximately . The route begins at the intersection of the West Side Road and the Hanaupah Canyon Road. For 6.5 miles, the route climbs out of the Badwater basin and into Hanaupah Canyon. Approximately 1.5 miles after reaching the end of the road, the trail leads directly to Hanaupah Spring, a seasonal water source that may not be available year-round. At the spring, the route then turns directly north (right) onto a scree/talus slope. Although this slope may look difficult to ascend, this is the correct way. Climbers should find the best route possible up the slope. Once finished climbing the talus slope and reaching the ridgeline, climbers should then should follow the ridgeline West to the Telescope Peak summit, which should be readily apparent. The Shorty's Well to Telescope Peak route can be completed in one day by experienced hikers, and has one of the largest elevation gains that can be obtained up a single summit; it can be descended either via Mahogany Flat or as a round-trip back to Shorty's Well.

His writings on contemporary artists like Caravaggio and Annibale Carracci remain one of our earliest sources of biographical information; his Considerazioni being an important source on art in early 17th-century Rome. Mancini was born in Siena and attended the University of Padua, where he studied medicine, astrology and philosophy. He went to Rome in 1592, where he practised medicine; from 1595 at the Hospital of Santo Spirito. He became personal physician to pope Urban VIII in 1623. The pope was a notable patron of the arts, and their relationship was such that, in 1628, Mancini was made an apostolic protonotary and a canon of St. Peter's. Mancini's writings went unpublished until the 20th century; his Considerazioni sulla pittura (thoughts on painting), written between 1617 and 1621, remaining so until 1956. His advice to the collector gives us insight into the contemporary art market in Rome; his notes on spotting fakes were the first indication of how sophisticated these pastiches had already become by the early 17th century. In the Considerazioni, he distinguishes four tracts of painting in his contemporary Rome: that of Caravaggio; that of Carracci; the third of Giuseppe Cesari; and the fourth of everybody else, the mannerist painter Cristoforo Roncalli for instance. There is evidence that he knew, at least Caravaggio, well, having attended to the artist when he was ill and staying at the Palazzo Madama, probably in 1595. Mancini was also well acquainted with Caravaggio's benefactor, Francesco Maria del Monte. As dealer he most notably sold Caravaggio's The Death of the Virgin to Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua for 280 scudi in 1607; a transaction proposed to the Duke by Peter Paul Rubens and brokered by Giovanni Magno. In his private life, Mancini was known as a self-confessed atheist, someone who moved in libertine circles, an art lover and a connoisseur. He was a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi, a literary club founded in 1603, which members included Giovanni Battista Guarini, Alessandro Tassoni, and Gian Vittorio Rossi. He also wrote on such diverse subjects as dancing and the ways of courtiers. Upon his death, Mancini left his fortune to be distributed among the students of Siena.

It was composed shortly after \\"Structure 1a\\", the opening of the piano duo Structures I (; ), the movement the composer would later describe as an experiment with \\"an expressive nadir\\" . The première of Polyphonie X on 6 October 1951 during the Donaueschingen Festival caused a scandal, with one half of the audience shouting and imitating animal noises, while the other half responded with applause and bravos . The title is often misinterpreted as having algebraic significance; in fact, the X is intended as a purely graphical symbol, implying the crossing of musical parameters which takes place in the score . Polyphonie X has only been performed twice, and only once in its entirety; after hearing a recording of the première Boulez immediately withdrew the work because he felt it suffered from \\"theoretical exaggeration\\" , intending eventually to subject it to a thoroughgoing revision . This never happened, so the piece remains unpublished.

The Marion Dufresne II (IMO 9050814) is chartered by the French TAAF on an annual basis from the French shipping line CMA CGM (The French Line) and is maintained by the IPEV (Institut polaire français - Paul-Émile Victor). The current Marion Dufresne II is the replacement for slightly smaller Marion Dufresne I that served the TAAF from 1973 to 1995. The ship was constructed by Ateliers et Chantiers du Havre of Normandy, France and delivered on 12 May 1995; it is registered out of the port of Marseille but its base of operations is the island of La Réunion. The Marion Dufresne was designed for the very severe weather conditions of the Southern Ocean. She possesses exceptional seakeeping behavior – allowing full performance in the very rough seas found there.  Mission  The Marion Dufresne is used to service the districts of the Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, and the smaller islands of Amsterdam and St-Paul, delivering supplies, fuel, and personnel to the three permanently manned bases there: Alfred Faure (Port Alfred), Port-aux-Français, and Martin-de-Viviès. With the additional capacity as a logistics vessel, the Marion Dufresne, as a research vessel, is among the largest of the world fleet. Her accommodation options, freight handling, and endurance allow cruises and research campaigns of the most demanding sort. Due to an increasing scientific demand, in 1999 the French Ministry of Research reduced the ship time devoted to logistical operations to 120 days per year and allowed the IPEV to conduct research world-wide for the remaining 245 days a year. Therefore, the ship is no longer confined to the Indian Ocean and conducts research in all oceans. This has allowed for the development of integrated, multidisciplinary programs, for instance, spending several months in 1999 coring for paleo-climatic purposes in the North Atlantic.  Ship facilities  With a capacity for 110 passengers in 59 cabins, the Marion Dufresne allows large scientific parties to embark on multidisciplinary programs. There is a hospital with operating theatre; pharmacy, video/conference center; library; gym and a ship's store. = Propulsion = Diesel-Electric propulsion is provided by three Cegelec electric motors – one 750 kW bow thruster and two AC synchronous electric propulsion motors: 2,650 kW ea manufactured by GEC Alsthom Moteurs driving two propeller shafts. Electric power to run the motors is generated by two 8-cylinder (8R32D) and one 6-cylinder (6R32D) diesel engines, manufactured by the Finnish company Wärtsilä. = Boats = The ship carries a complement of several smaller working boats on board. The largest is the container barge Gros Ventre (\\"Fat Belly\\"), named in honour of the fluyt Gros Ventre of the First voyage of Kerguelen; others include a small utility boat, a semi-rigid rubber raft, and a zodiac. Naturally the vessel also carries the required types of life boats. = Aircraft = The Marion Dufresne possesses a helicopter platform and may carry one of a series of helicopters to ferry provisions and personnel from ship to shore.

Notable events  On 15 December 2008, the ship was involved in the rescue of Bernard Stamm, whose IMOCA Open 60 racing yacht Cheminées Poujoulat ran aground and sustained significant hull damage near the Kerguelen Islands during the 2008–2009 edition of the Vendée Globe round the world, single hand yacht race. On 14 November 2012, Marion Dufresne ran aground as she reached Crozet Islands as part of third resupply campaign of the year. The incident resulted in a 25-metre breach in the hull, flooding of two watertight compartments, and disabling of the bow thruster. The crew managed to control the damages and safely returned the vessel off the island. The 110 passengers were evacuated by the on-board helicopter to the small station located on the island. After being assessed for seaworthiness, repairs were effected at the Elgin Brown & Hamer shipyard in Durban, South Africa. A similar accident occurred in 2005.

He served as Bishop of Evansville (1966–1969) and Archbishop of Cincinnati (1969–1972). Biography Paul Leibold was born in Dayton, Ohio, to Frank and Philomena (née Kirchner) Leibold. After graduating from Chaminade High School, and attending the University of Dayton for two years, he continued his studies at St. Gregory Seminary and at Mount St. Mary's Seminary. He was ordained a priest in Cincinnati, May 18, 1940, by Archbishop McNicholas. Early assignments within the diocese were pastor of St. Louis Church in Cincinnati, and assistant chancellor and chancellor for the archdiocese of Cincinnati. On April 10, 1958 he was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati. He was consecrated bishop June 17, 1958 and at the same time he was made titular bishop of Trebenna. Principal Consecrator was Archbishop Karl Joseph Alter. Possibly the most historical event of his career happened as a result of his acting as spiritual director for a young nun living in Ohio and Indiana. In 1963, while Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati, he issued an imprimatur to a diary of private revelations written by Sr. Mildred Ephrem Neuzil while she was serving at a convent (Kneipp Springs) in Rome City, IN. It was here that she claimed she was visited multiple times by the Virgin Mary who declared herself to be \\"Our Lady of America\\" and gave her important messages to be given to America's Bishops.. After issuing his imprimatur to the messages written down by Sr. Neuzil, later on, as Archbishop of Cincinnati, he went on to commission a statue, plaques, and even a medal to take these apparitions to the second level of Church confirmation. However, it did not advance beyond this level. On April 4, 1966 Paul Francis Leibold was appointed Bishop of Evansville, Indiana, and installed as Bishop of the diocese June 15, 1966. Bishop Paul Francis Leibold was appointed to Cincinnati July 23, 1969 following the retirement of Archbishop Alter at the same time. Upon installation as Archbishop, Paul Francis Leibold became seventh Bishop and sixth Archbishop of Cincinnati. One historian has characterized him as \\"both a warm-hearted, approachable pastor and a hard-worker.\\" But he was not to become a national leader among America's bishops as his predecessors had been.Roger Fortin, Faith and Action: A History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 1821–1996, pp. 358–359. He served the Archdiocese until his untimely death on June 1, 1972. The most significant accomplishments of his brief service as Archbishop of Cincinnati include the strengthening of the Archdiocesan Priests' Senate, the Archdiocesan Pastoral Council, and the parish councils of the Archdiocese. He also launched the diocese's sixth synod, Synod '71.Roger Fortin, Faith and Action: A History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 1821–1996, pp. 362. He is buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Lee is situated on the rugged and inhospitable stretch of coast between Ilfracombe and Woolacombe, which includes Bull Point (with its lighthouse) and Morte Point, both notorious for shipwrecks in earlier times, and both on the South West Coast Path. The village of Lee lies at the foot of what is known locally as the Fuchsia Valley, and consists of around 100 properties, mostly old in style. The village centre is about a from the sea, and is linked to the area around the bay by a road and level footpath. Lee is served by a combined pub, post office and shop, The Grampus; also by St Matthew's Church, by a gift/craft shop operating from the old schoolroom adjoining the church, and by the Lee Bay Hotel. As of 2009, the hotel was closed, and is being used by the police as a dog training centre. Around the bay area are the hotel (visible as the main building in the picture) and some 10 privately owned properties. Up to the late 1980s, several of these were in use as tea rooms, restaurants and gift shops. The beach has a very gentle slope. As the tide goes out an expanse of sand emerges from among the rocks, as does a way through the cliffs westwards round to a large shingle beach called Sandy Cove or Bath Beach. This beach is also accessible from the coastal path via a National Trust-maintained path and staircase down the cliff face. As the tide recedes further it becomes possible to scramble eastwards from Lee Bay over and round rocks and through pools to reach Broadoar, a mainly sandy beach, although it is possible to become trapped by incoming tides.

The Boston-based ska-punk band Big D and the Kids Table printed T-shirts referencing the song and compilation. They featured \\"L.A\\" with a strike through it on the front and \\"This is Boston Not L.A.\\" on the back.

Pinto joined Sepultura after Roberto Raffan left the band in 1984, becoming Sepultura's second bassist. Although no original members are left in Sepultura, Pinto is the longest remaining member of Sepultura. He received his first bass guitar, a white Giannini, when he was fifteen. His influences include Steve Harris, Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler, Cliff Burton and Gene Simmons, though Paulo plays bass with a guitar pick rather than his fingers. Career =Sepultura= In 1984, Xisto met the Cavalera brothers in the Santa Teresa neighbourhood of Belo Horizonte through a common friend. He joined Sepultura after the departure of the band's previous bass player, Roberto Raffan. Xisto played his first concert at the Ideal Club in Santa Teresa. He is their longest serving member. =The Unabomber Files= In 2009, Xisto joined with Alan Wallace and André Márcio of Eminence and Vladimir Korg of Chakal to form the band The Unabomber Files. In 2013, the group released a six-song EP and a teaser for the music video of the song \\"Buried In My Bunker\\". =Guest work= In 2007, Xisto played bass guitar on Sayowa's second album. In 2013, he made a guest appearance on Eminence's fourth album, The Stalker, providing extra bass accompaniment. Personal life Xisto grew up with two brothers and a younger sister.

It was awarded the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Novel. The book is set in San Diego, California, in 2025, in a variation of the fictional world Vinge explored in his 2002 Hugo-winning novella \\"Fast Times at Fairmont High\\" and 2004's \\"Synthetic Serendipity\\". Vinge has tentative plans for a sequel, picking up some of the loose threads left at the end of the novel. The many technological advances depicted in the novel suggest that the world is undergoing ever-increasing change, following the technological singularity, a recurring subject in Vinge's fiction and nonfiction writing. Plot summary Thanks to advances in medical technology, Robert Gu is slowly recovering from Alzheimer's disease. As his faculties return, Robert (who has always been technophobic) must adapt to a different world, where almost every object is networked and mediated- reality technology is commonplace. Robert, formerly a world-renowned poet but with a notoriously mean-spirited personality, must also learn how to change and how to rebuild relationships with his estranged family. At the same time, Robert and his granddaughter Miri are drawn into a complex plot involving a traitorous intelligence officer, an intellect of frightening (and possibly superhuman) competence hiding behind an avatar of an anthropomorphic rabbit, and ominous new mind control technology with profound implications. =Augmented reality= In the novel, augmented reality is dominant, with humans interacting with virtual overlays of reality almost all of the time. This is accomplished by wearing smart clothing providing gesture recognition and contact lenses that can overlay and replace what the eye would normally see with computer graphics, using advanced virtual retinal display (VRD) technology. In addition, haptic feedback is possible by overlaying graphics onto a physical machine such as a robot. This augmentation of reality is used for a variety of purposes: * Commercial (large gaming areas sell gaming environments mixed with haptics). The Cheapnet, a free entry-level service offered by commercial vendors of gaming solutions, can in principle also be used to coordinate networked augmented reality representations across the globe. However, jitter and latency are considerable problems with this basic network when long distances are involved. In the novel, Robert Gu develops an algorithm that partially compensates for these technical deficiencies, and might ultimately allow the inclusion of haptics. * Functional (maintenance workers, for example, have access to a blueprint or schematic of practically any location or object in their responsibility area) * Communication (characters in the novel use live video chat and can send and receive \\"silent messages\\", an action known as \\"sming\\", through their VRDs). Individuals can be reached through a globally implemented unique personal identifier, the ENUM. * Medical (doctors have access to a patient's vital signs) There are characters who choose not to \\"wear\\" these virtual overlays, instead using laptops, considered relics in the novel. A user's skill in managing and producing augmented reality manifests itself in the details of the augmentation. For example, a character might project himself into a different room, but the shadows cast by this apparition, or the collision between the character and the furniture in the room might give away the apparition. =Belief circles= There are many realities to choose from in the novel; however, the largest and more robust of them are built by large user bases in the manner of a wiki or Second Life. The confederation of users that contribute to the virtual world is called a belief circle. Several belief circles are presented in the novel, including worlds based on authors such as H. P. Lovecraft, Terry Pratchett, and the fictional Jerzy Hacek. Also mentioned are worlds based on the artwork of M. C. Escher, and fictional entertainment companies such as SpielbergRowling. The Egan Soccer set piece can also be seen as a type of subscribed Belief Circle. Themes As in Vinge's other work, the concept of security in such an increasingly digital/virtual world with ubiquitous computing is a major theme of the novel. It examines the implications of rapid technological change that empowers both the disgruntled individuals who would threaten to disrupt society and those that would seek to stop them, and the implications for the age-old \\"who watches the watchers\\" issue at the interplay between surveillance (oversight) and sousveillance (undersight). Characters * Robert Gu – former Professor Emeritus of English, Alzheimer's survivor and Fairmont High School pupil * Lena Gu - Robert's wife * Robert Gu, Jr. (Bob) – Robert Gu's son, Lieutenant Colonel and Officer of the Watch in the US Marines * Alice Gong Gu – Bob Gu's wife, Colonel and Auditor in the US Marines * Miri Gu – Bob and Alice Gu's 13-year-old daughter, Fairmont High School pupil and Robert Gu's co-conspirator * Juan Orozco – Fairmont High School pupil (age 14) and Robert Gu's technical advisor * Xiu Xiang - former Professor of Computer Science and Fairmont High School pupil * Winston Blount - former Dean at UC San Diego, colleague/rival of Robert Gu and Fairmont High School pupil * Zulfikar Sharif - Oregon State graduate student in literature who is writing a thesis on the works of Robert Gu. * Alfred Vaz – head of India's External Intelligence Agency * Günberk Braun – European Union Intelligence Board agent * Keiko Mitsuri – Japanese Intelligence agent * Mr. Rabbit/Mysterious Stranger – unidentified intellect, appearing as a rabbit to Vaz, Braun and Mitsuri, and as a voice only to Robert Gu Setting Much of the novel's action occurs on the campus of the University of California, San Diego, especially in and around the Geisel Library, the architectural centerpiece of the campus.

Most cultures have developed regional forms of grappling. Europe =British Isles= Traditionally wrestling has two main centers in Great Britain: the West Country, where the Devon and Cornwall styles were developed, and in the Northern counties, the home of the Cumberland and Westmorland styles. North Country styles * Lancashire wrestling is a historic wrestling style from Lancashire in England known for its \\"Catch-as-catch-can\\", or no wrestling holds barred, style. ** Catch wrestling, or Catch-as-catch-can, originated from Lancashire wrestling but was further developed during the traveling circus phenomenon of the 19th and early 20th century United States. * Backhold Wrestling, whose origin is unknown, was practiced in North England and Scotland in the 7th and 8th century but competitions are held in present-day at the Highland and Border Games as well as in France and Italy. Styles of Backhold are distinct from Lancashire Wrestling because they enforce rules designed to minimize injury to the participants by disallowing ground fighting. ** Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, or Cumbrian Wrestling, is practiced in the northern counties of England. It is a form of Backhold Wrestling where the wrestlers put the left arm over the opponents right arm and grip behind the opponent's back. Throws and trips are important since the first wrestler to touch the ground or break hold loses. Competitors often wear stockings (long johns), singlet and trunks. ** Scottish Backhold is a form of Backhold practiced in Scotland. Almost identical in style to Cumberland & Westmorland style apart from variations in rules. Competitors often wear kilts. West Country styles * Cornish wrestling, from Cornwall, is a form of jacket wrestling. It does not use groundwork. It is related to Breton Gouren wrestling. * Devon wrestling, or Devonshire wrestling, was a style similar to the Cornish style in that jackets were worn. Devonshire wrestlers, however, also wore heavy clogs and were able to kick the opponents. In matches between Cornish and Devon, Devonshire wrestlers might have worn one shoe only. Unlike Cornish wrestling, the style is generally considered to be extinct. Ireland * Collar-and-elbow is a jacket wrestling style native to Ireland that can be traced back to the 17th century. It was introduced to the United States by Irish immigrants, and was one of the most popular wrestling styles practiced nationwide there for much of the 19th century. =Nordic countries= * Glíma, the national sport of Iceland, originating from Norway, and traces its history to the Vikings and the Norse. It is a standing style with rules similar to Shuai jiao and Bukh, and consists of three forms: 1) Hryggtök, the Backhold Grip; 2) Brokartök or the Pant-and-belt Grip that utilizes a leather harness around the waist and thighs, which the wrestlers hold (making it a form of belt-wrestling similar to Swiss Schwingen), and 3) Lausatök or Free-Grip is the most aggressive form of glima and contestants can use the holds they wish. It is practiced both outdoors and indoors. * Kragkast, type of folk wrestling originating from Sweden, similar to Freestyle wrestling =Continental Europe= ;Western Europe * Gouren - traditional Breton jacket wrestling. Similar to Cornish wrestling. * Ranggeln - meaning \\"to wrangle\\" in German, Ranggeln is a prominent form of wrestling in Austria.

It appears in Domesday Book as “Alresford – forda Ralph de Limesy Mill”. The parish was part of the hundred of Carhampton. One of the village's main attractions is the much-photographed packhorse bridge. Built as a crossing over the River Aller (from which the village gets its name), it is thought to be medieval in origin. Nearby is the New Bridge where the A39 road crosses Horner Water. The wide pointed arch rises with a span half arch on the side for flood relief. Originally the bridge was wide but another was added in 1866. The packhorse bridge is an Ancient monument and has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register. Allerford New Bridge which carries the A39 road past the village is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade II* listed building. It is also on the Heritage at Risk register because of the risks of vehicle damage and erosion. The village is also home to Allerford House, childhood home of Admiral John Moresby, who explored the coastline of New Guinea and for whom Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea, was named. Other traditional sights in the village include thatched cottages, a forge and an old-fashioned red telephone box. There is also a Reading Room, built by the Acland family to foster adult education. One of the thatched cottages operated as the local Primary School between 1821 and 1981 and is now a museum containing the West Somerset Rural Life Museum and Victorian School. The museum houses the West Somerset Photographic Archive.

Gorski (born July 20, 1944) is an American politician in New York and a former Marine. A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo and many of its suburbs. He was the first Democrat-elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League's Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as KeyBank Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in veterans' affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo. Personal Gorski is the son of Helen and Chester C. Gorski, a former Buffalo City Councilman and former member of the United States House of Representatives. His brother Jerome Gorski was a New York State Supreme Court judge. Gorski was raised in Buffalo's far east side in a Polish community where he served as an altar boy and played baseball and basketball. He was the starting catcher for the Roman Catholic Timon High School and later became a political activist at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York. Gorski earned a degree in English literature from Le Moyne in 1966. As of February 1990, he and Mary Jo had been married for 15 years. At that time, they had five children ranging in age from 1 to 7 with the oldest two adopted. When he served in the New York State Assembly, he shared a house with Assemblyman Richard J. Keane. Gorski was a Buffalo Bills fan growing up, and he attended the first official game in franchise history at \\"The Rockpile\\" when he was 16 years old. It was an exhibition game against the Boston Patriots. He also attended the 1964 AFL season championship game. He followed the Bills while in Vietnam and as an Erie County Legislator he attended the 1972 groundbreaking ceremonies for Rich Stadium in Orchard Park, New York. He would eventually rise to be both a season ticket holder and the team's landlord, on behalf of the people of Erie County. Military career During the Vietnam War Gorski volunteered to serve in the military \\"because he thought it was the right thing to do\\" even though he could have sought a graduate school deferment. Joining the United States Marine Corps, he attended Marine Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1967. After this he was deployed to South Vietnam, beginning his tour of duty in December 1967. Initially he served as a platoon commander in a motor transport battalion stationed at Gia Le near Da Nang, under the command of Colonel Robert Reilly. While deployed, Gorksi took part in the Battle of Huế during the Tet Offensive, at which time his unit was employed largely in an infantry role. In April 1968, Gorski was the officer responsible for the night watch of battalion headquarters in Gia Le, when a People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) assault breached the perimeter wire fence. During the skirmish that followed, Gorksi directed artillery and mortar fire. About a dozen PAVN soldiers were killed in the engagement, along with three Marines. In January 1969 Gorski returned to the United States, having risen to the rank of captain. He earned no medals for bravery, however, nor was he wounded. Political career Gorski was a member of the Erie County Legislature from 1972 to 1974. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1987, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures. In the Assembly, he chaired the Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigation from 1980 to 1984, and the Committee on Local Governments from 1984 to 1987. In 1984, Assemblyman Gorski co- sponsored legislation that amended state no-fault insurance laws in order to preserve the right to declare \\"loss of fetus\\" as a serious injury in an automobile accident. Previously, the laws were written such that this type of loss had been dismissed in the Appellate Division of the New York State Court in a suit brought by Jane Raymond for a 1978 accident. In 1985, he was selected to light the flame at the openining ceremony for the eighth annual Empire State Games. That year, he was among the Vietnam War veterans from New York State invited by tour consultants when Vietnam opened its economy to American tourists. Gorski, who was the only former officer on the trip, had secured state funding for the venture. After alt=A green lawn with a wall in the background having several United States flags flying in the background and one tall flag pole with a high flying flag. When Gorski ran for the Democratic nomination for Erie County Executive in 1987, Buffalo City Councilman James P. Keane had the support of the Erie County Democratic Party and Joseph Crangle, but Gorski won the nomination in the September 15 primary election in what The New York Times described as an upset. In the general election, Gorski led in the polls against two-term incumbent Republican Edward Rutkowski, who had broken a campaign promise not to raise taxes, and he won the election by a two to one margin. He was the first Democrat ever elected Erie County Executive. Upon Gorski's assumption of office, he was met with the December 31, 1987 expiration of the temporary one percent increase in sales tax, and special governmental operations by New York State Governor Mario Cuomo were necessary to keep the county from losing revenues while awaiting reconvening of the New York State Legislature on January 6, 1988. After assuming office, Gorski was dissatisfied with Crangle's 23-year role as Erie County Democratic Chairman and sought a new county party leader. Although people such as Governor Cuomo had previously attempted to unseat Crangle, it was not until a few months after Gorski exercised his influence that Crangle stepped down. After he became County Executive, Gorski was succeeded as the 143rd district representative in the New York State Assembly by Paul Tokasz in a March 1988 special election. As County Executive, Gorski would oppose Mayor Griffin several times. One of the first occurred in 1989 when Griffin ignored Vietnam veterans' request to use LaSalle Park to host The Moving Wall, a half-size replica of the Washington, D.C.'s Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Gorski made Chestnut Ridge Park, which is located south of Buffalo in Erie County, available to the veterans. A major crisis during his administration led to the threatened shutdown of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority bus and Light rail Buffalo Metro Rail subway service throughout Western New York. At the time, Buffalo was the smallest American city with a subway system and Alfred Savage had just resigned as Executive Director to assume that position with the Chicago Transit Authority. During Gorski's first term the local economy was revitalized: by March 1990, Buffalo's monthly unemployment rate fell below the state average for the first time in 11 years, and the region's job growth had outpaced the state average for its fourth consecutive year. The city was ranked by Fortune as one of the nation's top five growth communities. Gorski signed the controversial item pricing law in 1991, making Erie County one of the earliest counties to confirm the requirement that most supermarket products have a price tags. By the time he ran for re-election for the first time, he was backed by both the County Democratic and Conservative parties, and he was challenged by fourth-term incumbent Mayor Griffin. Gorski handily won the Democratic nomination over Griffin by a 68-32 margin as well as the Conservative party nomination. Gorski handed Griffin the first general election defeat of his political career when the Mayor contested Gorski as the Republican Party and New York State Right to Life Party nominee. By the end of Gorski's first term, he had established himself as the most influential person in Western New York according to a report cited in The New York Times. 1993 World University Games to Buffaloalt=A black letter U above five different color stars above the letters FISU During Gorski's second term, one of the more unusual crises was the arrest of 194 pro-life protesters who mostly declined to post bail, which meant they were left in jail where the county was obligated to assume the costs for overtime and expenses associated with the arrests. In 1992, he ran against Republican Jack Quinn and Mary Refermat for Henry Nowak's seat in the United States House of Representatives to serve in the 103rd United States Congress. He was expected to win election to succeed Nowak in the New York's 30th congressional district. One reason for this expectation was that two of his recent predecessors were at the time in higher offices: New York State Comptroller Edward Regan and New York State Lieutenant Governor Stan Lundine. He lost the election however and Quinn went on to serve six terms. In both 1992 and 1993, the Erie County Legislature was unable to agree to pass the extended 1 percent special sales tax for the county without Gorski threatening major county cutbacks. When Buffalo hosted the 1993 Summer World University Games, Mayor Griffin was very much against the idea, but Gorski was considered one of the Games' godfathers. He stood behind the effort to host the games even as it went beyond its budgeted costs. In 1994, Republican George Pataki defeated Democrat Mario Cuomo, causing a crisis for the Democratic Party. Gorski also arranged the deal to keep the Buffalo Sabres from moving by helping to build Marine Midland Arena. Despite the troubles for the Democratic party in New York, Gorski defeated Republican Lucian J. Greco in his second re-election in November 1995. In 1997, the city of Buffalo was in such a financial plight that it considered merging itself into the county government. At the time, the Buffalo Bills were considering moving from the county-owned Ralph Wilson Stadium (then known as Rich Stadium) until they worked a deal with the county. The stadium name change was part of the deal that was eventually finalized between Gorski, Pataki and Bills Owner Ralph Wilson in late 1998. In 1998, Gorski was named County Leader of the Year by American City & County magazine. Gorski was considered a contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Pataki. In 1998, the Seneca nation filed suit that they were the rightful owners of Grand Island, New York, a island in the Niagara River with 17,000 residents, and all islands in the river. When Gorski ran for a third re-election, at first he was a wide underdog to Republican Joel Giambra, and it was the first time The Buffalo News, which was satisfied with Gorski's fiscal policies but was not impressed with his innovations, did not endorse him. By the final weekend before the election, Gorski had narrowed the gap among voters according to the polls. Gorski lost to Giambra, who had only recently switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party. In March 2014, Gorski announced his candidacy for Cheektowaga Town Justice. On November 4, Gorski won the election. He served a four-year term and was not a candidate for reelection in 2018. Private life Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo. Gorski worked for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) for nine years in a variety of capacities. At first he was hired as a consultant to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York in January 2000. At the time there was lots of talk in local op-ed pages about the prospects of him serving as Superintendent of Buffalo Public Schools. He also consulted for the Upstate Medicare Division. By December 2000, he had been hired as a Vice President of HealthNow. He eventually became a senior vice president at HealthNow overseeing government affairs and lobbying, which made him responsible for government health programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Family Health Plus and Child Health Plus and earned him a 2007 salary of $398,302. Previously, Gorski was HealthNow's vice president of policy and representation. In February 2009 HealthNow laid off 17 employees, including Gorski and three other senior executives, during a restructuring. In July 2009, Gorski was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo to help it negotiate government channels on many fronts—especially with its new \\"sustainable\\" coffee brands.

The place acquired cultural significance because it inspired the music for the famous tango \\"Caminito\\" (1926), composed by Juan de Dios Filiberto. History Brightly painted houses and local artists selling their work During the 1800s, a small stream flowing into the Riachuelo River ran along the same route where the Caminito is now. Later that century, this area of the stream became known as the Puntin, the Genoese diminutive term for bridge (a small bridge allowed people to cross the stream there). When the stream dried up, tracks for the Ferrocarril Buenos Aires y Puerto de la Ensenada were installed at the site. Disused tracks remain at the end of Caminito, along Garibaldi Street. In 1954, the railroad closed, and the area where Caminito was became a landfill and the neighborhood's eyesore. Over the following three years, Argentine artist Benito Quinquela Martín who lived nearby, painstakingly prepared the walls facing the abandoned street, applying pastel colors, and by 1960 had a stage put up at the southern end; the wooden- plank stage was replaced with a nearby theatre house in 1972. The artist was a personal friend of Argentine tango composer Juan de Dios Filiberto, who created a well-known 1926 tune by the same name.

Newcastle College is the largest college in the North East of England, with over 16,000 students. The College specialises in vocational education. The college provides Further Education, Higher Education, Apprenticeships and Adult courses and has five schools: The School of Creative and Digital Industries, The School of Engineering, The School of Health, Childcare, Business and Science and the School of Construction, Leisure and Sport and Newcastle School of Education. Newcastle College is a division of NCG, one of the largest education, training and employability organisations in the UK. Ofsted currently grade the college as 'Requires Improvement'.  History  Newcastle College can trace its roots back to 1894, when it was established as Rutherford Memorial College, becoming Rutherford Grammar School in 1945. In 1930, the President of the Board of Education Charles Trevelyan founded the Trevelyan Building for girls. In 1962 the college was divided into two separate divisions, the college of Further Education and the Charles Trevelyan Technical College. In 1972 the two colleges merged and became known as Newcastle College. According to The Journal, the college was falling into disrepair in the late twentieth century. Dame Jackie Fisher, who joined the college as principal in 2000 and later became chief executive of the group, suggests that the buildings were in a poor state due to lack of investment in the 1990s and that the structure of the college was wasteful. The restructuring took Fisher and her team three and a half years, with the college, as of September 2011, turning over £150m a year, compared to £45m in 2003. In 2013, Newcastle College appointed new Principal, Carole Kitching.  NCG  Newcastle College is a division of NCG (formerly Newcastle College Group). With a turnover of more than £155million, NCG is one of the largest education, training and employability organisations in the UK. In August 2007, the college merged with Skelmersdale & Ormskirk College, a college in Lancashire; it was later renamed West Lancashire College in August 2011. Intraining was formed in March 2008, following the acquisition of TWL Training in December 2007,http://www.tes.co.uk/Upload/Attachments/TES/3013442/About%20Newcastle%20College%20Group.pdf and the purchase of the troubled training organisation Carter & Carter in March 2008. This led to the introduction of the Newcastle College Group (NCG). In November 2011, the group also acquired the British youth charity Rathbone Training. The college attempted to merge with Northumberland College, but the Ashington-based college rejected the merger plans in response to feedback from their staff, students and local MPs. In November 2005, the Times Educational Supplement reported that lecturers who rebelled, \\"against new contracts, were defeated after they faced losing their jobs.\\" Following cuts by the coalition government, the college reorganised its curriculum structure leading to 200-equivalent full-time job losses, with 188 new jobs created in 2011. The restructure lead to the grade, and therefore salary, reduction of many teaching staff. Shortly after redundancies were announced, The Guardian reported that NCG's chief executive, Dame Jackie Fisher, \\"enjoyed a pay rise, including bonus and retention payment, of almost £73,000.\\" However, the report mentions a spokeswoman's defence of the pay rise, pointing out \\"that Fisher is responsible for three divisions with an annual turnover of £152m in 2009-10.\\" Also in 2011, allegations of workplace bullying were publicly made against college management and reported on the BBC's regional Inside Out programme in January 2012. NCG vehemently refuted these allegations stating that “it takes any allegation of bullying extremely seriously and has a clear and transparent process for dealing with staff concerns. All reported allegations are always thoroughly investigated and dealt with appropriately. Ofsted downgraded the college from 'outstanding' to 'good' following an inspection in 2012. It was widely reported that college management had ejected the inspection team from the premises, and that some inspectors were offered counselling as a result of the process. In March 2014, Newcastle Sixth Form College, a Further Education college in Newcastle upon Tyne, was official opened. In August 2014, Kidderminster College was acquired by NCG. In 2017, NCG merged with Lewisham and Southwark and Carlise College. Also in 2017, NCG CEO Joe Docherty was featured in The Chronicle's 'Most Influential List'. Alongside his role as CEO, Joe is also a Trustee of the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation – a charity which supports education, arts, environment and social change, and is also a Chairman and co-owner of Crosby's, a fast growing SME providing services and equipment to the catering industry. In 2018 Ofsted downgraded NCG from good, to requires improvement. Ofsted took the unusual decision to extend the inspection period by an extra day. This was agreed amicably between NCG and Ofsted as it was the largest and most complex FE inspection Ofsted has had to undertake, involving six colleges and a training organisation. NCG was the first Further Education provider in the UK to be awarded Taught Degree Awarding Powers, meaning it is now able to validate its own degrees.

It is situated within the Armagh City and District Council area. Charlemont Bridge joins the villages of Charlemont on the east bank of the River Blackwater and Moy on the west. It had a population of 109 people (52 households) in the 2011 Census. History In 1600, The 8th Baron Mountjoy was sent to the Kingdom of Ireland as the last Lord Deputy of Queen Elizabeth I. He joined a group of mercenaries who had been fighting in the valley of the Blackwater. Lord Mountjoy came to the place now known as Charlemont where he established a bridge of wood and a fort to guard the bridge in 1602. Prior to his founding of Charlemont Fort, the place had been called Achadh an Dá Chora, the 'Field of the Two Weirs', but it was renamed in his honour using his name and the French word for hill, 'Mont', i.e. Charlemont. Charlemont remained a significant military post during the Stuart era, and was garrisoned by a detachment of the Irish Army. In October 1641 it was seized by rebels under the overall command of Sir Phelim O'Neill at the beginning of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. O'Neill may have captured a copy of the Great Seal of Scotland in Charlemont which he then used to produce a forged commission from Charles I, apparently ordering the Catholics of Ireland to rise. In 1650, Charlemont was besieged by English Parliamentarian forces during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The English took the fort from its Irish Catholic garrison under Sir Phelim O'Neill, despite taking heavy casualties. It was again an important post during the Williamite War in Ireland and its Jacobite garrison under Sir Teague O'Regan was placed under a lengthy siege until being forced to surrender to the Williamite forces of Marshal Schomberg in 1690. =The Troubles= On 15 May 1976, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) launched two attacks on pubs in Charlemont. A bomb attack on Clancy's Bar left three Catholic civilians dead: 54-year-old Felix Clancy, 22-year-old Sean O'Hagan, and 41-year-old Robert McCullough. Shortly after, a gun attack on the nearby Eagle Bar led to the death of another Catholic civilian: 49-year-old Frederick McLoughlin two weeks later.

The plumbeous vireo is 4.75 inches (12 cm) in length, with a gray head, back, and flanks, and whitish underparts. It has a solid white eye ring and white wing bars. The song, given persistently, consists of short, rough whistled phrases of several notes, spaced about 2 seconds apart. The phrases often alternate ending on a high note and a low note, giving an impression of question and answer. The plumbeous vireo builds a cup nest out of bark strips and down in the fork of a twig. It lays 3 to 5 white eggs with some brown spots. This species was formerly considered to belong to the same species as Cassin's vireo and blue- headed vireo.

She first appears in Final Fantasy V as an early antagonist and later one of its protagonists. She was born Princess Sarisa Scherwil Tycoon, but was lost at sea and raised as a boy by pirates. She joins the group, hoping to understand why protagonist Lenna Charlotte Tycoon has the same pendant as her. She was created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and was based on the protagonist of the manga Princess Knight. Her promotional artwork was created by Yoshitaka Amano. She was originally intended to be a gambler, but this was changed when the writers determined it did not fit with the world of Final Fantasy V. In the first English version of Final Fantasy V, she spoke with a pirate accent, which was changed in the Game Boy Advance port of Final Fantasy V. The accent was the subject of criticism. Faris was otherwise well-received, identified as a standout of the game's cast and a strong female character. Concept and creation Faris Scherwiz is a pirate captain who was created as a protagonist for Final Fantasy V by Hironobu Sakaguchi, who based the idea of her being a Princess disguised as a man on the manga Princess Knight. Her promotional artwork was created by Yoshitaka Amano, who identifies her as one of his favorite works. She was originally a female gambler named Eva Scherwil but this was changed when they found that this archetype did not fit well in the world of Final Fantasy V. They changed her character to be a pirate and sister to fellow protagonist Lenna Charlotte Tycoon. In the Japanese version, Faris uses the masculine pronoun ore to present a tough and masculine image. Unlike the Japanese version, the first official English translation in the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy V featured in Final Fantasy Anthology had her speak in a pirate accent. This was changed in the Game Boy Advance port. She is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the Japanese version of World of Final Fantasy and by Emily O'Brien in the English version. Appearances Faris first appears in Final Fantasy V, where she is the captain of a pirate ship disguised as a man. Before the events of Final Fantasy V, she was raised as Sarisa Scherwil Tycoon, the daughter of King Alexander Highwind Tycoon and sister of Lenna Charlotte Tycoon. She is lost at sea at a young age and discovered by pirates, who name her Faris after she has trouble pronouncing her name. She befriends a sea dragon named Syldra who helps move her ship without wind. Protagonists Bartz Klauser, Lenna Charlotte Tycoon, and Galuf Doe attempt to steal her ship in order to find and protect three Crystals after a first has already been shattered. She captures them and tries to hold Lenna ransom due to her being royalty, but decides to help them find the Wind Crystal when she realizes that she and Lenna share the same pendant. Faris becomes one of the Warriors of Light along with the other protagonists to protect the other Crystals. Syldra protects Faris from an attack and is lost at sea, causing Faris grief and forcing them to find another means of transportation. Her true gender is discovered by Bartz and Galuf. She is later shown a vision of someone she cares about, who turns out to be King Tycoon, leading her to suspect that she and Lenna are related. The second Crystal is shattered, and Syldra appears to rescue them, but Syldra's wounds are too great and she drifts into the current. They attempt to save the Fire Crystal but are unable to do so. Faris tells Lenna that they are sisters, and they discover King Tycoon on their way to find the Earth Crystal,. Tycoon then proceeds to attack the group. They are saved by Galuf's granddaughter Krile who brings him to his senses. The Earth Crystal shatters and releases antagonist Exdeath, leading the King to sacrifice himself to protect the group. Faris battles against Exdeath in another world, where he shatters that world's Crystals and kills Galuf. Faris wakes up in Tycoon Castle where her return is celebrated, but she dislikes this and she and Lenna reunite with Bartz and Krile. She also discovers Syldra's spirit, who grants Faris the power to summon her. They battle against Exdeath and their spirit reforms the Crystals to bring back peace to the worlds. Faris returns to Tycoon Castle to serve as Queen, but soon returns to a life of piracy. She reunites with the other Warriors of Light years later. She has appeared as a playable character in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia, and Final Fantasy Record Keeper. She appears in World of Final Fantasy as a supporting character. Reception Since appearing in Final Fantasy V, Faris has received positive reception, particularly as a female video game character. In a Japanese poll on players' favorite Final Fantasy women, Faris ranked eighth, tied with Garnet from Final Fantasy IX. She is also regarded as the most memorable and interesting character in Final Fantasy V by Heidi Kemp of GamesRadar+, author Chris Kohler, and IGN staff, the latter which identified her as the 11th best Final Fantasy character. Marshall Lemon of Escapist Magazine also regarded Faris highly among its cast, questioning why she does not have her own game. Nintendojo staff ranked her as among the best female video game heroines due to her physical strength, valor, and defiance of stereotypes as a woman and princess. The discovery that Faris was a woman made Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan like her more than they already did. Shayera the Starsword of RPGamer enjoyed her character archetype and noting her as an exception to a lack of cool female characters in Final Fantasy. Chad Concelmo of Destructoid praised Faris' outfit for being an interesting spin on pirate's garb and for being complex in a similar way to Faris. They took issue however with the raised collar and \\"too-high boots.\\" Her pirate accent in the PlayStation release of Final Fantasy V was controversial for not matching the original Japanese dialogue. Writers Aaron Lakuszka, Jeremy Parish, and Joe Juba for Nintendo World Report, 1UP.com, and Game Informer respectively particularly appreciated the English version of Final Fantasy V Advance for removing this aspect of her dialogue and found it one of its highlights.

Collegiate career Lord played quarterback at the University of Nebraska and ran the Huskers' option-style offense of the era. Jammal's athleticism allowed him to excel as a double-threat quarterback, although his passing ability was criticized.

One of Lord's memorable moments as a Husker came when his career as a starting quarterback was under fire during his junior year. Having been demoted from the first team offense during the week of practice leading up to the October 5, 2002 game with McNeese State, Lord took it on his own to pick up the slack for his struggling offense. After finding out he was still the team's starting quarterback not long before kickoff time, Lord made the most of it. He finished the game with 17 rushes for 218 yards including touchdown runs of 5, 57, and 56 yards and also went 12-of-18 passing the ball for 151 yards which set a new Husker school record for rushing yards by a quarterback and total yards (369).

The order linked the change of the separate life of monks in the 12th century with the retrospective life of the friar, who was considerably more active. History Beeleigh Abbey was originally a daughter of Newsham Abbey in Lincolnshire, established at the instigation of Robert de Mantell, lord of the manor of Little Maldon. The abbey obtained a royal charter from Richard I in 1189. The heart of Saint Roger Niger of Beeleigh (a thirteenth-century Bishop of London) was buried at Beeleigh and the abbey became a pilgrimage site.SP Nunn, St Roger of Beeleigh, Maldon Archaeological and Historical Group In 1289, pilgrims included King Edward I and Queen Eleanor. A plan of Beeleigh Abbey as it was in 1536. By permission of Stephen P. Nunn from his book ‘St. Roger of Beeleigh’ 2001 After the dissolution of the monasteries, many of the abbey buildings were pulled down. In 1540, Henry VIII granted the abbey and lands to Sir John Gate, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Thirty years after the land was given away there was an extension added to the abbey of a farmhouse. During the 18th century, the building was used as a public house. By the late 19th century, the buildings were in a ruinous condition, but in 1912, restoration was begun by Captain F. W. Grantham. In 1943, the Abbey was purchased by William Foyle, owner of Foyles bookshop. The abbey is now a private residence and is not generally open to the public, but small private groups may be shown around it by prior arrangement with the owners. The roofs of the resilient medieval buildings can be seen from a footpath that runs down market hill and ends following the River Chelmer. The abbey gardens, are now also open to the public, on specific days during the summer months. As a point of interesting recent history, the Premonstratensians returned to Essex in 2008, establishing a house at St. Philip's Priory in Chelmsford, some 8 miles from Beeleigh. In 2010 the Prior of St Philips Priory and three of the canons, were welcomed to Beeleigh Abbey, the first such visit by White Canons since the visit in 1955 by Father Norbert Backmund of Windberg Abbey in Bavaria. He was the first White Canon to have visited Beeleigh since the monastic dissolution in 1536. In April 2011, the Abbot General, worldwide head of the Premonstratensian Order (White Canons) in Rome, Father Thomas Handgraetinger, was welcomed at Beeleigh, together with the Prior of Chelmsford, Father Hugh Allan, and three canons. Father Hugh Allan, Prior of Chelmsford, was promoted to Abbot, and with the agreement of the owners of Beeleigh Abbey, Mr & Mrs Christopher Foyle, became Titular Abbot of Beeleigh, the first Abbot of Beeleigh since 1536. On 8 December 2016 at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady Immaculate in Chelmsford Father Hugh was enthroned Abbot by the Bishop of Brentwood in the presence of the Bishop Emeritus, the Anglican Bishop of Chelmsford, the High Sheriff of Essex and other Essex VIPs, many canons and clergy and a full congregation. Christopher Foyle presented the mitre to the Abbot. In August 2000, following the death in 1999 of the previous incumbent, William Foyle's daughter Christina Foyle, Christopher Foyle, chairman of Foyles Bookshops, and from 1978 until 2006, chairman of the Air Foyle Group, his cargo and passenger airline corporation, and his wife Catherine, purchased Beeleigh Abbey and its 400-acre estate beside the river Chelmer from Christina Foyle's executors. They then set about a four-year restoration of the Abbey and its gardens, which had deteriorated somewhat during the previous 30 years. As a result, in 2008, they were awarded, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, their East of England Conservation Award, and later in the same year, their National Conservation Award, for the best restored historical building in the UK. Archaeology In 2000, the owners arranged for an archaeological investigation of the site that continued until 2006.Below Ground at Beeleigh (Maldon Archaeological and Historical Group, 2007) A geophysical survey was followed by an excavation. During the course of the investigation there were a number of \\"open days\\" which allowed hundreds of visitors to see the site. Nothing could be dated to the 1180 construction, but among the discoveries were the foundations of a medieval hall house, a brick clamp, and other outbuildings. Other finds included large amounts of pottery dated from the 12th to the 16th century, a small amount of early (13th - 16th century) coins, some jetons and a seal matrix that belonged to the Abbey. Further excavations are being planned.

College football career  Symons played for the University of Colorado Buffaloes between 1962 and 1964. He was a versatile player, running, leading the team in receptions, punt returns and kickoff returns, and doing some punting.  NFL  In 1965, Symons was drafted by the NFL's Green Bay Packers in the 6th round (80th overall) and by the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs in the 20th round (157 overall). He attended two Green Bay training camps, and almost made the team, but an injury led Vince Lombardi to cut him.  CFL  = BC = The BC Lions took a chance on Symons in . He only played 10 games, most at the defensive safety position. He rushed for only 20 yards, as the Lions were not convinced his knee injury had fully healed. At the end of the seasons, the Lions were eager to get the rights to the eventual CFL great and Hall of Famer Jim Young. Bill Symons was the second player in the trade that also sent all-star defensive lineman Dick Fouts to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for Young, perhaps the only trade between Hall of Famers. = Toronto = Toronto, with their new head coach Leo Cahill, was determined to turn their losing ways around, and in , Symons was given a chance. He did not disappoint, picking up 349 yards rushing and positioning himself as a starter. Everything came together in , when Symons rushed for 1,107 yards. He was the first Boatman, ever, to top the 1,000 yard plateau. Added to this record was his CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award, again a first for any Double Blue player, and a CFL All-Star at running back. In 1969 and 1970, he shared running duties with Dave Raimey, obtained that year in a trade from Winnipeg. He gained 905 yards on the ground in 1969 and 908 in 1970. In 1971, Symons shared running back duties with Leon McQuay, when Raimey was converted to defensive back. Symons unhesitatingly turned to being a great blocking back, still gaining 418 yards in the bargain. The only thing missing was a trip to the Grey Cup, something that all Argonaut fans craved (waiting since ). In addition, Symons turned down an offer from the NFL's Denver Broncos (in his home state) to stay in Toronto. Unfortunately, their trip to the 59th Grey Cup ended in classic heartbreak, as the very same star, Leon McQuay, fumbled the ball deep in Calgary territory in the final minutes, a significant factor in the Argos loss. Being a blocking back, Symons' final two season saw reduced statistics, though he rushed for 235 yards in 1972 and 358 in 1973. Symons called it quits after 1973 to donate more time to his successful AFA Forest Products company. Symons also has a farm in Caledon, Ontario.  Post football career, honours and awards  For his great performances as a running back, Symons was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1997.

F. Kluge. A sequel, Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!, followed in 1989. Plot A television reporter named Maggie Foley investigates the mysterious disappearance of legendary rock star Eddie Wilson. Flashbacks dramatize Eddie's life and the rise and fall of his rock and roll band, Eddie and the Cruisers. The band gets its start at a Somers Point, New Jersey club called Tony Mart's. Not adept at writing lyrics, Eddie hires Frank Ridgeway aka \\"Wordman\\" to be the band's keyboard player and lyricist, over the protests of band manager Doc Robbins and bassist Sal Amato. Rounding out the Cruisers are saxophonist Wendell Newton, background singer and Eddie's girlfriend Joann Carlino, and drummer Kenny Hopkins. The band's first album, Tender Years, becomes a major hit, but recording their next album, A Season in Hell, turns out to be a nightmare. Inspired by the bleak, fatalistic poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Eddie pushes his bandmates beyond their limits, musically and personally. Eddie wants to be great, but bassist Sal replies, \\"We ain't great. We're just some guys from Jersey.\\" Eddie makes it clear that if the band cannot be great, there is no reason to ever play music again. A Season in Hell is ultimately rejected by Satin Records on the grounds that it is \\"dark and strange\\". In the early morning hours, Eddie's car crashes through the railing and over the Stainton Memorial Causeway. Eddie vanishes without a trace, his body never found. Almost 18 years later, Satin re- releases the band's first album, which charts even higher than it did originally. A television documentary is soon in the works, exploring the mystery of the band's second album, which had disappeared from the vaults of Satin Records the day after Eddie's disappearance. All of the original Cruisers are set to participate in it except Eddie and Wendell Newton, who had died of an overdose (reported as a heart attack) in August 1963 at age 37. The others are now living ordinary lives: Sal Amato fronts a Cruisers tribute band. Ridgeway is a high school English teacher in Vineland. Doc works as a radio disc jockey in Asbury Park. Joann is a stage choreographer in Wildwood, and Hopkins works in an Atlantic City casino. During the documentary interviews, the band expresses a desire to relive the past, even though many of their memories are humiliating. For example, during a concert at Benton College, where Frank was once a student, Eddie ridicules Frank repeatedly by referring to him as \\"Toby Tyler\\" after seeing him and Joann kissing before the concert. The other Cruisers members share similar stories. Joann is able to complete the one piece of the puzzle that Frank could not: revealing what happened to the band's second album. After storming from the studio, Eddie brought her to the Palace Depression, a makeshift castle made of garbage and junk that he visited often as a child. She reveals it was in fact she who took the master tapes for the album from Satin Records, hiding them in the Palace of Depression, where she felt they belonged. Frank and Joann go back to the Palace of Depression to retrieve the master tapes. A mystery man driving a blue '57 Chevy Bel Air convertible identical to Eddie's arrives at the house and calls to Joann. But before she can reach the car, Frank unmasks the impostor, revealing him to be Doc, who was after the master tapes all these years. Moved by his story, Frank and Joann give him the master tapes. Doc drives off into the night vowing that the Cruisers will finally conquer the world this time, while Joann invites Frank into her house. In a surprise reveal at the ending, a bearded, much older looking Eddie is shown alive, watching the multiple televisions in the window of an appliance store, where the end credits of Foley's documentary tribute to him and the band roll. He smiles serenely, proud to know that his work is finally being heard, and then disappears into the night. Cast In addition, the music producer/supervisor for the film, Kenny Vance, appears on screen as Lew Eisen, the 1964 record company executive who refuses to accept the band's second album. In September 2018, Tommy Marz released a series of interviews he conducted with members of the film's cast, as well as members of the production team. The article highlighted the 35th anniversary of the film and details how life changed for the people involved. Cast notes Only two cast members, Michael \\"Tunes\\" Antunes, the tenor saxophone player for John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, and backup singer Helen Schneider were professional musicians in the fictional band. Ellen Barkin's appearance in the film is uncredited. Production =Development= Martin Davidson has said that the inspiration for the film came from a desire to \\"get all my feelings about the music of the last 30 years of rock music into it.\\" He optioned P. F. Kluge's novel with his own money and at great financial risk.Muir 2007, p. 84. He wrote the screenplay with Arlene Davidson and decided to use a Citizen Kane- style story structure. He remembered, \\"That was in my head: the search.\\"Muir 2007, p. 86. Davidson made a deal with Time-Life, a company that was going into the movie-making business. However, it quickly left the business after making two films that were not financially successful. He was understandably upset and a couple of days later he went out to dinner and met a secretary who had worked on his first film. He told her what had happened to his film, and she gave his script for Eddie and the Cruisers to her business partners. In a relatively short time, a deal was struck with Aurora and Davidson was given a $6 million budget. =Shooting= In order to get a credible looking and sounding band for the film, Davidson hired Kenny Vance, one of the original members of Jay and the Americans. He showed Davidson his scrapbook, the places the band performed, the car they drove in, and how they transported their instruments. Vance also told Davidson stories about the band, some of which he incorporated into the script. Tom Berenger has said that he did not try to learn piano for the film but did practice keyboards for hours in his trailer. Matthew Laurance actually learned how to play the bass through rehearsals. Michael Paré was discovered in a New York City restaurant working as a chef. He said of his role in the film that it was \\"a thrill I've never experienced. It's a really weird high. For a few moments, you feel like a king, a god. It's scary, a dangerous feeling. If you take it too seriously\\". Davidson had the actors who played in Eddie's band rehearse as if they were getting ready for a real concert. Pare remembers, \\"The first time we played together - as a band - was a college concert. An odd thing happened. At first, the extras simply did what they were told. Then, as the music heated up, so did the audience. They weren't play-acting anymore. The screaming, stomping and applause became spontaneous.\\" Davidson recalls, \\"One by one, kids began standing up in their seats, screaming and raising their hands in rhythmic applause. A few girls made a dash for the stage, tearing at Michael's shirt. We certainly hadn't told them to do that. But we kept the cameras rolling.\\" Additionally, New Jersey musician Southside Johnny was hired as a technical advisor for the film. Ellen Barkin, who has the small role of the television reporter, Maggie Foley, later said that she \\"hated\\" making the film: > That was what we liked to call a \\"pay the rent\\" job. It wasn't a script I > liked, but I remember my agent at the time saying, \\"Look, you only have to > work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say > it was your first movie and they just didn't release it.\\" I think people > were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I > wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess. > Like, when I'd go, I'd think—I like to make a movie where I know who the > boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it seemed like it > was just, \\"Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?\\"\\"Ellen Barkin on > great directors and her favorite roles, from Diner to Buckaroo Banzai\\" By > Sam Fragoso, Random Roles - AV Club Mar 14, 2015, accessed 30 March 2015 According to Davidson, when he completed the film, three different studios wanted to distribute it, and he went with Embassy Pictures because they offered him the most money. However, they had no prior experience in distribution and were unable to properly release it in theaters. Davidson remembered, \\"And six months later, somebody said, 'Your picture is appearing on HBO this weekend,' and I didn't even know.\\" Soundtrack Vance asked Davidson to describe his fictitious band and their music. Initially, Davidson said that the Cruisers sounded like Dion and the Belmonts, but when they meet Frank, they have elements of Jim Morrison and The Doors. However, Davidson did not want to lose sight of the fact that the Cruisers were essentially a Jersey bar band, and he thought of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The filmmaker told Vance to find him someone that could produce music that contained elements of these three bands. Davidson was getting close to rehearsals when Vance called him and said that he had found the band—John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band from Providence, Rhode Island. Davidson met the band and realized that they closely resembled the band as described in the script, right down to a Cape Verdean saxophone player, whom he cast in the film.Muir 2007, p. 87. Initially, Cafferty was only hired to write a few songs for the film, but he did such a good job of capturing the feeling of the 1960s and 1980s that Davidson asked him to score the entire film. After successful screenings on HBO in 1984, the album suddenly climbed the charts, going quadruple platinum. The studio re-released the soundtrack in the fall of 1984. Nine months after the film was released in theaters, the main song in the film, \\"On the Dark Side,\\" was the number one song in the country on Billboards Mainstream, Rock, and Heatseeker charts;Muir 2007, p. 88. and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Another single from the film, \\"Tender Years\\", peaked at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Reaction Eddie and the Cruisers was originally intended to open during the summer, but a scheduling error resulted in a September release, when its target audience - teenagers - were back in school. The film had its world premiere at Deauville. Embassy Pictures threw a promotional party for the film at a West Hollywood dance club in September, 1983 where Cafferty and his band played. The film was a box office flop, receiving many negative to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in theaters on September 23, 1983 and grossed $1.4 million on its opening weekend. It would go on to make $4.7 million in North America. The film was pulled from theaters after three weeks and all of the promotional ads pulled after one week. In the fall of 1984, the single \\"On the Dark Side\\" from the soundtrack album suddenly climbed the charts, as the film was rediscovered on cable television and home video, prompting the studio to briefly re-release the album. Critical reception Eddie and the Cruisers was not well received by critics. Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, \\"the ending is so frustrating, so dumb, so unsatisfactory, that it gives a bad reputation to the whole movie.\\" In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Some of the details ring uncannily true, like the slick oldies nightclub act that one of the Cruisers is still doing nearly 20 years after Eddie's supposed death. Other aspects of the film are inexplicably wrong. Eddie's music sounds good, but it also sounds a lot like Bruce Springsteen's, and it would not have been the rage in 1963.\\" However, she did praise Paré's performance: \\"Mr. Paré makes a fine debut; he captures the manner of a hot- blooded young rocker with great conviction, and his lip-synching is almost perfect.\\" Gary Arnold, in the Washington Post, wrote, \\"At any rate, it seemed to me that what Eddie and the Cruisers aspired to do was certainly worth doing. The problem is that it finally lacks the storytelling resources to tell enough of an intriguing story about a musical mystery man.\\" As of October 2018, the film holds a rating of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews. Re-release In 1984, Eddie and the Cruisers was discovered by additional audiences during its first pay cable run on HBO. Embassy Pictures re-released the film for one week based on successful summer cable screenings and a popular radio single, but it once again failed to perform at the box office. Looking back, Davidson said, \\"that picture should have been a theatrical success. There was an audience for it. People still watch it and still tell me about it.\\" Davidson was offered the job of directing a sequel to the film, but he was not keen on the idea and wanted no participation. The eventual project, which had no link to the Kluge source novel, was released as Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives! in 1989. References Bibliography *Muir, John Kenneth.

Though Interstate 205 passes over it on the Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge, access to the island is only by boat. There is a city controlled locked gate in the 205 fence. The Government Island State Recreation Area includes 15 miles of shoreline, with two docks on the northern side of the island. The interior of the island is accessible only by permit and contains protected natural areas, such as Jewit Lake. Camping is permitted below the vegetation line around the perimeter of the island. Picnic tables and restrooms can be found in these areas as well. Government Island is home to a variety of animals, notably a great blue heron colony that has been on the island for at least a decade. Many threatened or endangered wildlife species live on the island, including red-legged frog, pileated woodpecker, little willow flycatcher, olive-sided flycatcher, western meadowlark, horned grebe, red-necked grebe, bufflehead, purple martin, and possibly the endangered Columbian white-tailed deer. Government Island’s first documented visitors were British explorer William Robert Broughton in 1792 and American explorers Lewis and Clark in 1805. The island acquired its current name after being appropriated by the U.S. military in 1850 to grow hay. An old barn and other structures can be found on the interior of the island from when it was privately owned and settled by a small number of families. Most of the island is owned by the Port of Portland. The Port acquired the entire island, along with the adjacent Lemon Island () and McGuire Island (), in 1969 in order to expand nearby Portland International Airport. Though those plans have been abandoned, the Port continues to control the land to prevent any uses incompatible with its location under the airport's primary flight path. In 1999 the Port sold of the island to Metro, a regional government agency, and leased the remainder to the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department for 99 years. Trivia In July 2014, three people were stabbed on Lemon Island during a party of several hundred people that was hosted there without a permit from Oregon Parks & Recreation.

It is near Miyakonojō, Miyazaki. As of April 2017, the city has an estimated population of 37,038 and a population density of 95 persons per km². This is down from the 2006 population data, which was an estimated population of 43,752 and a population density of 112 persons per km². The total area is 390.39 km². Soo is one of the many small cities in Japan that have a steadily decreasing population.:ja:曽於市#.E4.BA.BA.E5.8F.A3 Geography Much of Soo is mountainous and covered with forest. It rains, but it rarely snows. Soo is located in Kagoshima so it also receives ash from its volcanoes, most notably: Shinmoedake and Sakurajima. Soo is a land-locked city and is in middle of the Ōsumi Peninsula. History The modern city of Soo was established on July 1, 2005, from the merger of the towns of Ōsumi (Iwagawa), Sueyoshi and Takarabe (all from Soo District). Transportation =Air= The closest airport is Kagoshima Airport which is located in Kirishima. =Train= All of Soo had a train system, but due to low use most of it was torn out and paved into a running path. There are three small un-manned train stations in Takarabe (Northern Soo) that connect to trains going to Miyazaki Prefecture and to Kagoshima City. They are: Takarabe Station, Kitamata Station, and Ōsumi- Ōkawara Station =Buses= There is one bus that travels from Miyakonojo through Soo to Kanoya, and another one that travels to Shibushi. =Roads= Like many other places in Kagoshima Prefecture, Soo is home to many narrow mountain roads and so has a high rate of traffic accidents. There is also a few bus routes through Soo. Due to the sparse public transport most people in Soo drive cars. Expressways The Higashi Kyushu Expressway starts at Soo Yagoro in southern Soo. It connects all the way to Expressways in Kumamoto, Miyazaki and Kagoshima City. From Iwagawa (Yogoro entrance) to Sueyoshi it is free. from Sueyoshi on it is a Toll Express Way. Commerce Sueyoshi is famous throughout Japan for producing Yuzu (a citronella). Ōsumi is known for its Chinese cabbage and watermelons. Soo City in general also raises black pork and beef which is the local delicacy. Before it closed, the high school in Takarabe was an agriculture school, reflecting the importance of the agriculture industry in the area. Education There are 20 Elementary schools, 5 Junior High schools, and 1 High school in Soo City. Sueyoshi has 9 Elementary schools, 1 Junior High school, and 1 High school. Ōsumi has 7 Elementary schools and 1 Junior High school. Takarabe has 4 Elementary schools, 1 Junior High school. Beginning with the 2012–2013 school year, small Jr High schools will be absorbed into the larger schools, resulting in all areas of Soo City having only one Jr High each (Ōsumi already went through this process 4 years ago). Takarabe went through this change in 2012. Currently the Elementary and Jr High schools in the areas of Ōsumi and Takarabe are taught by ALT's (Assistant Language Teacher) hired through the JET Programme. The ALT in Sueyoshi is a direct hire. The high school in Soo City is visited by the same ALT from the JET Programme. Recreation There are many points of interest and Festivals that can be visited in Soo City. Kirihara Falls, Soo City, Iwagawa – September 2011 Iwaya Buddha, Soo City, Iwagawa – September 2011 =Yagorou Statue= In Iwagawa there is the Legend of Yagorou, which is represented by a very tall statue on a hill near the bypass on the way to Kanoya from Miyakonojo. Near the statue is a restaurant, an onsen, and a visitors center. Also near the statue is Ōsumi's Michi no Eki where many locally grown foods and teas can be bought. In spring all of the cherry trees on the hill bloom and it is a popular spot to view them. Yagorou Festival Every year on November 3 there are 3 different festivals (Matsuri) dedicated to Yagoroudon. One in Soo (Ōsumi), one in Nichinan, and one in Yamanokuchi (both in Miyazaki Prefecture). The town has a smaller statue of Yagorou (just over 4 meters tall) that is pulled from the through town. This festival is called the Yagorou Festival or the Yagorodon Festival. The mobile statue of Yagorou pulled through Ōsumi is the second largest of the three Yagorou festivals. The largest is in Nichinan (just over 7 meters tall), and the smallest is in Yamanokuchi. It is said that there were 3 Yagoroudon brothers, hence the three different locations of festivals (one for each brother). =Ookawara Gorge= has campsites and a little village where cabins can be rented. It is in Takarabe, and it hosts a waterfall called Kirihara Falls (桐原の滝 \\"Kirihara-no-taki\\") that is lit up at night. There are also many scenic ponds at the base of the waterfall with many places to picnic. =Iwaya Buddha= One of the eight views of Kannon that can be seen in Soo (according to the sign at the trail head down to the Iwaya Buddha). It was carved hundreds of years ago and is reached by climbing down many stairs to a cliff face above a river. =Mizo no Kuchi= is located in Takarabe and is a tunnel made long ago through erosion. it is 13.8 meters tall and 8.6 meters long. Festival Every year on the Sunday closest to the Buddha's birthday (April 8) the is held at the natural tunnel. At the festival school children dance through the tunnel in traditional costumes. =Yabusame Festival= Every year on November 23 at there is a Yabusame festival. Originally, a student from the local junior high school was selected three months prior to the festival. Then he trained to shoot arrows on horseback for the festival. In many cases he had never touched a horse before he was selected, let alone ridden a horse before. How many shots he made was supposed to show how good the harvest will be for the year. For at least the past 4 years, however, two girls have been the riders/shooters for the festival. Starting when they were in Jr. High school, they practice riding and shooting a few months before the festival. A third girl, currently a 6th grade student, has been shooting at the past two festivals, and a 5th grade boy began riding, but not shooting, at last year's festival. =Onioi Festival= In Sueyoshi in Soo every January 7 at there is an . Onioi is a festival or ceremony in which the demons are driven out in order to let good luck in.

At the time of its construction, it was one of only three concrete stadiums in the world.http://syrguide.com/guide/2013/03/27/archbold-stadium/  History  The stadium was named for John D. Archbold, who donated $600,000 for the project. He was also responsible for funding towards the building of Archbold Gymnasium, located just to the east overlooking the stadium. The stadium was occasionally used to stage Syracuse Stars minor league baseball games, such as in 1920 while the Stars were awaiting the completion of Star Park.  Description  202x202px The 800' x 475' stadium was oval-shaped, with a track (originally dirt) and a natural grass football field. The west end zone, the stadium's main entrance, was marked by a grand castle-like façade with turrets framing the gateway arch. There was originally a wooden roof over the central section of the south grandstands for the reserved seating.  Grandstand expansion  203x203px In the 1950s, the stadium was expanded to the north and south, bringing the capacity up to 40,000. However, by the 1970s, stricter fire codes forced a reduction in capacity to 26,000. This proved to be the stadium's undoing. By the mid-1970s, Syracuse faced the prospect of being demoted to Division I-AA unless it got a more modern stadium, and quickly. It was closed following the 1978 season, to be razed for the building of the Carrier Dome, which occupies Archbold's former footprint.  Final game  In the final game at Archbold Stadium, on November 11, 1978, the Orangemen defeated nationally ranked Navy, 20-17. During its history, Syracuse compiled a 265-112-20 record at Archbold.

It is operationally similar to the Combat Reconnaissance Platoon (Indonesian: Peleton Intai Tempur, abbreviated \\"Tontaipur\\") from the Army's Kostrad corps. Taifib was previously known as \\"Kipam\\" (abbreviation from: \\"Komando Intai Para Amfibi\\") which literally means in English: the Para-Amphibious reconnaissance Commandos, it was formed in 1961. They were officially formed on 13 March 1961 as Kipam. Set at a regimental strength of two battalions, \\"Taifib\\" is formed basically as the elite amphibious reconnaissance unit of the Indonesian Marine Corps. It was first deployed for conflict management in Irian Jaya (Papua) in April 1962. Starting from November 1971 it was called Batalyon Intai Amphibi (\\"Yon Taifib\\") or Amphibious Recon Battalion. History At the time of the establishment of Indonesian Marine Corps, the marine corps lacks the capability of intelligence, as well as special forces trained and able to carry out special activities that can not be done by ordinary units in the framework of the success of a task. Answering the need of an intelligence gathering unit, on March 13, 1961, the Marine Corps High Command issued a decree (No.47/KP/KKO/1961) regarding the formation of the Para-Amphibious Reconnaissance Commando Unit (Indonesian: Komando Intai Para-Amfibi / KIPAM). Those marines received training at the British-run Jungle Warfare Center in Malaya. During the following year a second group attended U.S. Marine reconnaissance training at Coranado. These cadres were combined to form the core of an elite reconnaissance unit combining airborne and amphibious skills. The KIPAM unit first saw actions during Operation Trikora, as part of the Indonesian forces forward deployed to Western New Guinea as part of their operations against the Armed forces of the Netherlands. KIPAM and Kopassus personnel on loan to KOPASKA both were responsible for the retrieval of the bodies of the 7 victims of the 30 September Movement of 1965, in the presence of senior military officials. On July 25, 1970, KIPAM, then a detachment sized formation, was transformed into a battalion, the Yon lntai Para Amfibi. On 17 November 1971, Yon lntai Para Amfibi was again renamed into Satuan Intai Amfibi, eventually renamed again into Batalyon Intai Amphibi, abbreviated YonTaifib. The unit was placed under the Marine Corps Combat Support Regiment. Along with the development of the Marine Corps and the inauguration of the 1st Marine Force (), on 12 March 2001, the Marine Corps General Command issued a decree (No. Skep/08/111/2001) in which Taifib are no longer placed under the Marine Corps Combat Regiment and are now under the jurisdiction of the newly formed 1st Marine Forces. Looking at the scope of the assignment and its capabilities, Taifib was finally officially designated as a Special Forces of the Indonesian Navy. This was reinforced by a decree issued by the Commander of the National Armed Forces (Skep/1857/XI/2003) on 18 November 2003. To complement the expansion of the Corps a second battalion assigned to the 2nd Marine Forces was raised in 2008, and a 3rd is under formation, assigned to the 3rd Marine Forces. Mission Yontaifib has the main duty of fostering and providing the amphibious elements for amphibious operations as well as becoming the reconnaissance operation unit for the Indonesian Navy task force which cooperates with the IMC. The nickname of the \\"Sea Ghost\\" (Indonesian: Hantu Laut) was given to the Taifib unit due to their deadly capabilities within the sea/ocean. Taifib unit has individual abilities above the average of ordinary soldiers and is able to quickly adapt to every operational surrounding environment. Infiltration and en-filtration capabilities to enemy areas, free fall with HALO and HAHO, STABO / SPIE systems, swimming, diving, and underwater capabilities as combat swimmers through submarine torpedo launchers become the most lethal capabilities possessed by this unit. Recruitment and Training Taifib accepts volunteers from the Marines with at least two years' experience. Seven months of commando training include a one-month airborne course: airborne qualification wings are presented after five day jumps, one night jump, and one 'rough terrain' jungle jump. Refresher jumps are conducted into the water. Motto Maya Netra Yamadipati, which originally comes from Sanskrit, is the motto of the Taifib, which means: * Mayanetra - Invisible * Yamadipati - Angel of Death The overall motto means that every Taifib member has the ability to move quickly, secretly and lethally in every mission.

His twelve-year career in the National Football League (NFL) was spent entirely with the Chicago Bears. Early life Musso was the son of a coal miner who starred in high school sports in Collinsville, Illinois, and was therefore offered an athletic grant to attend James Millikin University. His father, who initially planned to pull him out of school after he completed his \\"primary\\" education, grudgingly allowed George to attend college. College years Musso attended Millikin University and was a standout in football, basketball, baseball, and track. Millikin was in the \\"Little 19\\" conference that included such teams as Eureka, Lombard, and Augustana. In 1929, Musso played against future President Ronald Reagan, who played guard for Eureka College and weighed about 175 pounds; Eureka lost to Musso and Millikin 45–6. Musso was already larger than most linemen of his era, playing college ball at 6' 2\\", 255 pounds. In 1933, Musso played in the East-West All- Star game, held in Chicago; it was there he first got the attention of George Halas. NFL years Halas, who had doubts the small school Musso could make it in the NFL, offered Musso a $90 a game contract (this was half rate for regular players at that time). Musso agreed and, although he struggled at first, became the centerpiece of the Bears line for 12 years. One reason the Bears of that era were called \\"Monsters of the Midway\\" was their imposing size—Musso, who played professionally at 270 pounds, was one of the largest Bears and one of the largest players in the league. His teammates called him \\"Moose.\\" He played offensive tackle until 1937 when he moved to guard. He was the first to win All-NFL at two positions; tackle (1935), and guard (1937). He played middle guard or nose tackle on defense his entire career. Musso captained the Chicago Bears for nine seasons, playing on the line with other NFL notables as Link Lyman, Joe Kopcha, Walt Kiesling, Bulldog Turner, Joe Stydahar, and Danny Fortmann. He played in seven NFL championship games, with the Bears winning four (1933, 1940, 1941, and 1943). He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982. Of note, in 1935 as an NFL lineman, Musso played against Gerald Ford of Michigan in the 1935 College All-Star game. Without a doubt, Musso is the only NFL player, to have played against two U.S. Presidents. After the NFL Musso retired to Edwardsville, Illinois, and began a restaurant business. He served as the Madison County, Illinois, sheriff and treasurer from the 1950s through the 1970s. He died in his home in Edwardsville in 2000.

It is resident throughout its range and is generally found in arid, rocky cliffs, outcrops, and canyons. It is a small bird that is hard to see on its rocky habitat; however, it can be heard throughout the canyons by its distinctive, loud song. It is currently in a monotypic taxon and is the only species in the genus Catherpes. Taxonomy The taxonomy of the species has been altered and debated for many years, with from three to eleven subspecies being proposed at various times. Generally, three subspecies are recognized. Originally in the genus Thryothorus, it was moved into the genus Salpinctes along with the rock wren (Salpinctes obsoletus), where some researchers still place it; however, generally, now, the species is in the only species in the genus Catherpes. The three generally recognized subspecies are: *C. m. mexicanus occurring in the central and southern portions of the Mexican Plateau *C. m. albifrons occurring in the northern portion of the Mexican Plateau, into west-central through western Texas *C. m. conspersus occurring in the remaining portion of the range in the U.S. and Canada These subspecies are distinguished by the bill of C. m. albifrons which is generally longer than that of C. m. mexicanus, and its plumage paler, with upperparts more grayish brown, with narrower black bars on tail. In C. m. conspersus the plumage is paler and it is smaller than C. m. mexicanus. Distribution Resident, although individuals may make short seasonal movements. It ranges from southern British Columbia in the Okanagan Valley and western and southern Idaho and southern Montana south through central Wyoming, Colorado throughout much of Mexico south to western Chiapas. It occurs east to southwest Oklahoma and in the Edwards Plateau of west- central Texas. Disjunct populations occur in the Black Hills of southwest South Dakota, northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana. During the winter season the distribution is generally the same, however; concentrations may occur in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwest Texas. Habitat Similar to the rock wren in habitat, the canyon wren prefers steeper rocky environments, particularly in arid landscapes and deep canyons and terrain (sometimes including buildings, woodpiles, and rock fences). Diet The canyon wren feeds on small insects and spiders. Since they live on large rocks, they use their long beaks to scope out small crevices. They also get their source of liquid from the insects they consume. Ecology It feeds on insects and spiders by probing into crevices with its long bill. Its coloration is rustier than that of the rock wren, with a contrasting white throat and breast. The canyon wren is more often heard than seen, and its falling series of whistles is one of the more familiar bird calls of the canyons of the western United States. Canyon wren nest from Texas It builds a cup nest out of twigs and other vegetation in a rock crevice. It lays 4 to 6 eggs, white with reddish brown and gray speckles.

The U.S. military is developing PEP using an invisible laser pulse which ablates the target's surface and creates a small amount of exploding plasma. This produces a pressure wave that stuns the target and electromagnetic radiation that affects nerve cells causing a painful sensation. The technology can be used as a lethal weapon. The pulsed energy projectile is intended for riot control and is said to work over distances of up to 2 km. It weighs about 230 kg and can be mounted on vehicles. The US system was developed by Mission Research Corporation (now owned by Orbital ATK). It uses a chemical deuterium fluoride laser device producing infrared laser pulses. The plasma (produced by the early part of the pulse) explodes because its electrons absorb the energy of the later part of the pulse. In 2003, a US military review reported that the electromagnetic radiation produced by PEPs cause pain and temporary paralysis in animal experiments. The United States Special Operations Command FY 2010 plans included starting development on a Counter UAV Pulsed Energy Projectile.  Controversy  PEP became controversial when it appeared that a team under Brian Cooper was assigned to work on the pain factor. It was discovered that PEP could with some tweaking induce cold burn feelings and other forms of painful sensations. The controversy and the fear of public opinion to see it turned into a torture tool that wouldn't leave any physical evidence on the victim ended the official program. Cooper kept on studying effects of laser-generated plasma pulse on pain receptors and published a paper in 2008 called \\"Frequency Dependent Interaction of Ultrashort E-Fields with Nociceptor Membranes and Proteins.\\".

It is the primary home competition venue for the university's gymnastics, volleyball, and wrestling teams. Usage Courts inside Fitzgerald Field House Fitzgerald Field House is the competitive venue for the Pitt varsity sports of volleyball, gymnastics, and wrestling. With an indoor track, the Field House also serves as the primary indoor facility for the university's track and field team, as well as housing the wrestling training facility and the primary training and weight facilities for Pitt's Olympic sports. In addition, it contains the offices and locker rooms for baseball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, and tennis. The facility also has squash courts. The Field House is connected by a tunnel to Trees Pool and the Gymnastics Training Center, both located in Trees Hall. Built in 1951, Fitzgerald Field House was, for five decades, the home of Pitt's basketball program. The Field House provided a home court advantage that allowed the program to achieve a 414-175 (.703) record while utilizing the facility. It also served as the home basketball court of Pitt's intracity rival, the Duquesne University Dukes, from 1956-57 to 1963-64. From 1984 until 2002, the Pitt men's basketball team also played selected Big East Conference and non-conference games at the Civic Arena. Pitt's women's basketball team also used the Field House as their primary home court. Both the men's and women's Pitt basketball teams moved to the Petersen Events Center in 2002. In 1999, Fitzgerald Field House underwent $3.8 million ($ million today) in renovations of existing facilities and a major addition to the west side of the building for locker rooms, team dressing rooms, and training and equipment rooms. In the summer of 2005, the wrestling training facility built in 1951 was reconstructed to be twice the size of the previous training facility and also received new floor and wall mats, a new ventilation system, new lighting, a video and recruitment room, and a balcony suspended above the mats featuring cardio equipment. In addition, an Olympic sports weight room was added to serve as a primary training facility for over 300 Pitt student-athletes and includes Hammer Strength and Nautilus Next Generation machines, nearly 8,600 pounds of free weights, and a comprehensive cardiovascular unit, including treadmills, stationary bikes and the Stairmaster Gauntlet. The renovations and addition of the weight room reduced the seating capacity from its prior 6,798 seats to a capacity of 4,122. Further renovations of the Field House in 2008 totaled $1.4 million ($ million today) and included new volleyball courts and installation of seating and electronic equipment to meet NCAA requirements.

It was introduced in 1983 in anticipation of the introduction of long-distance competition in the United States. The area code was intended for assignment by interexchange carriers to implement new services rapidly. The destinations of numbers in this numbering plan area (NPA) are exclusive to each carrier. A local exchange carrier routes calls to 700-numbers to the presubscribed interexchange carrier, unless the caller overrides presubscription by prefixing the destination telephone number with a carrier identification (101XXXX). Almost all of the early 700-offerings have ceased, because of a combination of confusion, blocking of calls to them by many businesses, and many alternative services. The number 700-555-4141 was intended for service provider identification by all carriers who implemented the area code. In 1992, AT&T; introduced a 700-number service branded as AT&T; EasyReach 700. It provided a service for subscribers to forward calls placed to a personal 700-number to any domestic telephone number. Either the caller or the subscriber could be set up to pay for the incoming calls. If the call originated from a telephone not pre-subscribed to AT&T; as its interexchange carrier, the caller was required to dial 10-ATT prior to dialing the 700-number. Some carriers have used area code 700 to offer carrier network services. For example, Vonage has provided weather information with (700) WEATHER (700-932-8437).1-700-WEATHER, from Vonage Within North America, area code 700 has become the de facto area code in software-defined voice networks. In many cases, the area code is used when large organizations interconnect multiple sites or agencies, organizations, or jurisdictions under a common numbering plan. For example, Walmart uses area code 700 to provide a \\"store support hotline\\" (700-Walmart, 700-925-6278) on its internal store phone network. It provides a common area code when integrating voice-over-IP (VoIP) networks. AT&T; and other providers offer managed VoIP services that route all customer calls (internal and external) over the carrier network. Many VoIP SDN services use area code 700 to denote VoIP calls requiring software-defined network routing.

In addition to messaging, they may be used in abbreviated dialing. Short codes are designed to be easier to read and remember than telephone numbers. Short codes are unique to each operator at the technological level. Even so, providers generally have agreements to avoid overlaps. In some countries, such as the United States, some classes of numbers are inter-operator (used by multiple providers or carriers, U.S. inter-operator numbers are called common short codes). Short codes are widely used for value-added services such as charity donations, mobile services, ordering ringtones, and television program voting. Messages sent to a short code can be billed at a higher rate than a standard SMS and may even subscribe a customer to a recurring monthly service that will be added to the customer's mobile phone bill until the user texts, for example, the word \\"STOP\\" to terminate the service.  Short codes and service identifiers (prefix)  Short codes are often associated with automated services. An automated program can handle the response and typically requires the sender to start the message with a command word or prefix. The service then responds to the command appropriately. In ads or in other printed material where a provider has to provide both a prefix and the short code number, the advertisement will typically follow this format: *Example 1 - Long version: Text Football to 72404 for latest football news. *Example 2 - Short version: football@72404  Regional differences  = Albania = Short Codes are five digits in length and start with 5, also are known as short codes for value added service. = Australia = Short codes are six or eight digits in length, starting with the prefix \\"19\\" followed by an additional four or six digits and two.

It was adapted into the 1971 film Get Carter, starring Michael Caine as Jack Carter. The novel portrays a subsection of society living on the borderline between crime and respectability. The book was a major influence on the noir school of English crime fiction. The novel went out of print for many years and slipped into obscurity, but there was a resurgence of interest in it in the 1990s after the film adaptation, Get Carter, gradually grew in reputation. The book was republished in paperback under the title Get Carter by Allison & Busby in 1993. In 2016 the playwright Torben Betts adapted the novel for a critically acclaimed production by Newcastle's Northern Stage. Plot summary Jack's Return Home tells the story of Jack Carter, an amoral, pitiless London mob enforcer who returns to his home town to investigate the mysterious death of his brother, with whom he had not spoken in many years. Jack's presence in the town causes unease among the local crime families, who fear that his snooping will interfere with their underworld operations. Everything from simple suggestion to brute force is employed to try to get him to leave, but he doggedly refuses, bullying his way through numerous attempts on his life to arrive at the truth, leading to a violent and ambiguous conclusion. Film adaptations The novel has so far been filmed three times, as Get Carter in 1971 and the 2000 remake, and as Hit Man in 1972. Further Carter novels Jack Carter was featured in two prequel novels, both written by Lewis. *Jack Carter's Law (1974) *Jack Carter and the Mafia Pigeon (1976) Trivia The first printing of the paperback which tied in with the film version was published under the title Carter (Pan Books 1971, ). All references on the cover of the book also refer to the film under this title. The character of Jack Carter, though not fully named for copyright reasons, plays a key role in the Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill graphic novel League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Century: 1969. The story takes place during 1969, shortly before Jack's visit 'up north' and the events of Jack's Return Home.

The \\"RN\\" in the call is for Radio Niagara. The station was launched in 1947 by local businessman B. H. Bedford, operating on AM 1600 with the callsign CHVC. The station's studios were originally located under the Rainbow Bridge. The station was acquired by Radio Niagara in 1964, and adopted the CJRN calls that year. Radio Niagara moved the station's studios to Clifton Hill in 1965. In 1970, the station moved to its current frequency, and in 1978, Radio Niagara was acquired by local businessman Keith Dancy. In 1986, Dancy also opened CJFT in Fort Erie. From 1984 to 1992, Buffalo Sabres play- by-play co-announcer Rick Jeanneret hosted a popular morning show on the station. He ended the show after the retirement of Ted Darling made Jeanneret the full-time announcer for the team. Dancy died in 2001, and ownership of the stations was assumed by Niagara Broadcasting. Later that year CJRN, formerly an oldies station, adopted a tourism info format that had previously aired on what previously had been temporary FM station CFLZ-FM, a format similar to the travelers' information stations in the United States.Decision CRTC 2001-620 CJRN and CFLZ-FM trade formats, CRTC, October 2, 2001 Because of the format flip, CJRN inherited the onerous restrictions that CFLZ had been required to honor, which severely limited the content that CJRN was allowed to broadcast (the restrictions went so far as to disallow broadcasting of out-of-town sports scores, one of the \\"violations\\" of the terms of license cited when the station's license was eventually revoked). These restrictions proved unworkable. The station's licence renewal application was denied by the CRTC on October 10, 2012 due to the station being unable to adhere to those restrictions. As a result, CJRN ceased broadcasting on November 30, 2012.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-550 CJRN Niagara Falls – Non-renewal of licence, CRTC, October 10, 2012 Other programming In addition to its regular schedule of tourist information programming, CJRN acted as the radio broadcast home for the sports teams of Buffalo, New York's Canisius College, including men's and women's basketball and hockey.

He was also occupied with the conservation of Norwegian stave churches and the construction of canals in 19th century Norway. Early life and education Peter Blix was born in the little town of Frederiksvern (now Stavern) south of Larvik in Vestfold. He was the eldest son of auditor John Gill Blix (1797–1874) and his wife Anna Dobberdine Randulff (1804–37). Blix's early childhood was marred by his mother's death when he was five years old. He eventually traveled to Kristiania (now Oslo), where he studied at the Christiania Burgher School (Christiania Borgerskole). The school system in Norway was under reform at the time Blix studied. The Latin was to be replaced with the mother tongue; the traditional memorizing method for students was to be replaced with new, sophisticated studying methods. At Oslo Cathedral School (Christiania Katedralskole) – where Blix later took his matric, one could note the contention between the classicists (pro-Latin) and the realists (pro-Norwegian). He was educated at the Polytechnical School of Hannover and in Karlsruhe. In Hannover, Blix came under the influence of the German professor and architect Conrad Wilhelm Hase. In 1851, Blix traveled to Hannover, Germany to study at the faculty of Architecture and Landscape Sciences at the Leibniz University Hannover. He was not the only Norwegian student at the school; there were at least 53 other Norwegians there, amongst them Paul Due, Halvor Heyerdahl and Henrik Thrap-Meyer. The professor Conrad Wilhelm Hase at the university had a few years earlier installed several reforms that Blix and his students took advantage of. Blix became very influenced by Hase's Neo-Gothic architectural style, which style he later would use on railway stations and churches in Norway. Upon finishing his study in Hannover, Blix studied from 1854 to 1855 at the University of Karlsruhe. Career When he returned from Germany, he was employed by Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (Kanalvæsenet), for which government agency he researched the possibility of a canal in Tyrifjorden. Blix also periodically maintained a private practice as an architect and designed several villas and hotels. His work for the railroad industry included construction of Østfold Line through Old Town Oslo. Blix, who considered himself an engineer as well as an architect, also worked with Stadsingeniør in Bergen. In 1880 he became head of the restoration of the Bergen Cathedral and Håkonshallen. In 1895 Blix was commissioned to create restoration plans for Akershus Fortress. Hove Church at Vikøyri Blix was also engaged in a number of organizations in Norway. He was a member of the Norwegian Polytechnic Society and founded the Norwegian Engineer and Architect Association in 1874. A controversial and headstrong personality, Blix came often in conflict with his colleagues, though Herman Major Schirmer's obituary of him called him a \\"warm and generous person\\". Blix bought the historic Hove Church at Vikøyri in Vik in 1880 and restored the church between 1883-1888. Blix's goal was to finish the stone church to its original conditions. Blix removed all the fixtures that were not from the Middle Ages. On the exterior Blix built up a large stone tower on the old base of the tower. He owned the church until his death, and bequeathed it to his brother who then gave it to the state. When Blix died in 1901 and he was buried under the floor of the church.

Afrikaans: Hentiesbaai, German: Hentiesbucht) is a coastal town in the Erongo Region of western Namibia. It is located 70 km north of Swakopmund and is an important holiday settlement. 70 kilometres to the north of the town is the seal colony of Cape Cross. The town had 4,720 inhabitants in 2011, up from 3,285 in 2001. The mayor of Henties Bay is Herman /Honeb. History Bartolomeu Dias sailed along the Atlantic coast in 1488. Near the area of today's Henties Bay he discovered such an abundance of fish that he named this coastline Praia das Sardinhas, Coast of Fish. The fresh water source was first discovered by Schutztruppe soldiers in 1886. In 1920, a minerals prospector stayed overnight. After tasting the water he was said to be healed from an affliction. The namesake of the town is major Hendrik \\"Henty\\" Stefanus van der Merwe who discovered the place in 1929 while looking for water. He had been hunting a rhinoceros in the arid hinterland of the Namibian coast near the Brandberg in order to collect a reward from a museum in Pennsylvania that was in search of a rhino skeleton. After shooting the rhino and scraping meat from the bones, water resources of the expedition diminished and forced the party to load the decomposing carcass and search for water. They chose to head into the direction of the Atlantic coast and reached it close to Cape Cross. From there van der Merwe and his fellows searched southwards for the mouth of Omaruru River. A few miles south of the mouth they discovered a deep sand valley with reed grass growing in it, advertising the presence of fresh water. Van der Merwe liked the place and after delivering the bones and collecting his reward, returned the following Christmas to build a wooden hut in the riverbed. The place became known as Henty se baai (Henty's Bay) and developed into a holiday hideout, mainly because of the abundance of fish at this spot. In 1951 the South–West Africa Administration mandated to South Africa, proclaimed erven in the Omaruru riverbed that were available for rent, but the erection of permanent structures was not allowed. The first shop was established during that time. A lighthouse was erected to guide ships along the dangerous Namibian coast. In the 1960s mining holes were dug after diamonds had been found in the area on a few occasions. A few years later mining was abandoned due to lack of success. In 1966 it was decided that the riverbed must not be settled in, and property north and south of it was sold. A hotel was built one year later, and the town began to develop. Environment and tourism The town is predominantly a tourist destination for anglers and 4x4 enthusiasts. Its property market has expanded significantly since the late 1990s, particularly for upmarket holiday accommodation. Henties Bay is situated in the National West Coast Recreation Area but there are few restrictions, particularly for driving off-road on the beach and across the plains. This lures tourists into the area but puts a burden on the sensitive environment. Specifically in danger are the lichen fields which take decades to recover from tracks cut through them, and the Damara tern which is endemic to the Skeleton Coast and threatened by habitat loss. A new multimillion- dollar Tourism Center was inaugurated in October 2016. Industry Areva, a French company who has built the first desalination plant in Southern-Africa at Wlotzkasbaken, north of Swakopmund, has proposed developing a desalination facility north of Henties Bay. Plans also include the production of a non- toxic plant for Jatropha, a source of bio-fuel which is adapted to arid environments. According to designers, the desalination plant would have capacity to supply the nearby towns of Uis, Okombahe and Henties Bay. The University of Namibia (UNAM) in July 2017 revealed plans to establish a marine engineering and mining training facility at the coast. An eight-hectare piece of property has been donated by the town's municipality which would house the School of Marine Engineering and Maritime Studies. Politics Henties Bay is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats. Henties Bay is home to the Civic Association of Henties Bay, a local political party which contests local elections. From 2004–10, the local authority of Henties Bay included 3 members of the Civic Association, 3 SWAPO members and 1 member of the United Democratic Front (UDF).New mayor to heal rift in Henties community The Namibian, 4 June 2004 In the 2010 local election, the Civic Association received the most votes (approximately 44%), while SWAPO finished in 2nd place with approximately 37%.

Bifrost uses the typical server, server builder, and client backdoor program configuration to allow a remote attacker, who uses the client, to execute arbitrary code on the compromised machine (which runs the server whose behavior can be controlled by the server editor). The server component (sized around 20–50 kilobytes, depending on variant) is dropped to \`C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bifrost\\\\server.exe\` with default settings and, when running, connects to a predefined IP address on TCP port 81, awaiting commands from the remote user who uses the client component. However, both installation directory and TCP port can be changed. TCP connection is encrypted by a password (default: \\"pass\\"), but this can be changed as well. It can be assumed that once all three components are operational, the remote user can execute arbitrary code at will on the compromised machine. The server components can also be dropped to C:\\\\Windows and file attributes changed to \\"Read Only\\" and \\"Hidden\\". Casual users may not see the directories by default due to the \\"hidden\\" attributes set on the directory. Some anti-virus programs (example AVG 17th Feb 2010) seem to miss the file entirely. The server builder component has the following capabilities: * Create the server component * Change the server component's port number and/or IP address * Change the server component's executable name * Change the name of the Windows registry startup entry * Include rootkit to hide server processes * Include extensions to add features (adds 22,759 bytes to server) * Use persistence (makes the server harder to remove from the infected system) The client component has the following capabilities: * Process Manager (Browse or kill running processes) * File manager (Browse, upload, download, or delete files) * Window Manager (Browse, close, maximize/minimize, or rename windows) * Get system information * Extract passwords from machine * Keystroke logging * Screen capture * Webcam capture * Desktop logoff, reboot or shutdown * Registry editor * Remote shell On December 28, 2005, the Windows WMF exploit was used to drop new variants of Bifrost to machines. Some workarounds and unofficial patches were published before Microsoft announced and issued an official patch on January 5, 2006. The WMF exploit is to be considered extremely dangerous. Older variants of Bifrost used different ports, e.g. 1971, 1999; had a different payload, e.g. \`C:\\\\Winnt\\\\system32\\\\system.exe\`; and/or wrote different Windows registry keys. Bifrost was designed at a time when Windows UAC (introduced with Windows Vista) wasn't yet introduced.

(1977). Mrs Man. Germainbooks. . Its motto is \\"A wife should no more take her husband's name than he should hers. My name is my identity and must not be lost.\\"http://lucystoneleague.org The League's official website, which uses retro-style graphics. Navigation is by clicking as usual. It was the first group to fight for women to be allowed to keep their maiden name after marriage--and to use it legally.Stannard 1977, the entire Ch. 15 = \\"The Lucy Stone League\\" = pp. 188-218. It was among the first feminist groups to arise from the suffrage movement and gained attention for seeking and preserving women's own-name rights, such as the particular ones which follow in this article. History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II The group took its name from Lucy Stone (1818-1893), the first married woman in the United States to carry her birth name through life (she married in 1855). The New York Times called the group the \\"Maiden Namers.\\" They held their first meetings, debates, and functions at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City, including the founding meeting on 17 May 1921.Stannard 1977, pp. 191-192. The founder of the Lucy Stone League was Ruth Hale, a New York City journalist and critic. The wife of New York World columnist Heywood Broun, Ruth Hale challenged in federal court any government edict that would not recognize a married woman (such as herself) by the name she chose to use. The only one in her household called Mrs. Heywood Broun was the cat.Stannard 1977, pp. 180-181. The League became so well known that a new term, Lucy Stoner, came into common use, meaning anyone who advocates that a wife be allowed to keep and use her own name. This term was eventually included in dictionaries.Stannard 1977, p. 193. Women who choose not to use their husbands' surnames have also been called Lucy Stoners. Members The group was open to women and men. Some early members were, in alphabetical order:Stannard 1977, pp. 192, 193, and 209. * Franklin Pierce Adams, columnist * Heywood Broun, columnist * Janet Flanner, Paris correspondent for The New Yorker * Zona Gale, Wisconsin-based author and playwright, first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and political-campaigner for women's rights * Jane Grant, New York Times reporter, wife of Harold Ross (founder of The New Yorker), and cofounder of The New Yorker * Ruth Hale, journalist and publicist * Fannie Hurst, author * Beulah Livingstone, silent movie publicist * Anita Loos, playwright-author * Neysa McMein, illustrator * Solita Solano, drama critic, editor, and writer * Sophie Treadwell, playwright, journalist Some of the members often attended the Algonquin Round Table.Stannard 1977, p. 181. Since many League members wrote for a living, they could and did write frequently about the group in New York City newspapers. There were many well- known women who were Lucy Stoners and kept their names after marriage but were not known to be League members, such as (listed alphabetically) Isadora Duncan (dancer), Amelia Earhart (aviation celebrity), Margaret Mead (anthropologist), Edna St. Vincent Millay (poet), Georgia O'Keeffe (artist), Frances Perkins (first woman appointed to any U.S. cabinet), and Michael Strange (poet, playwright, actress) – aka Blanche Oelrichs – aka the wife of actor John Barrymore.Stannard 1977: p. 197 for Duncan, then Earhart p. 215, Mead p. 199, Millay pp. 197-198, O'Keefe p. 198, Perkins p. 189, Sanger p. 197, and Strange pp. 192-193. First historical period The founding of the League was presented above, in the introduction. Ruth Hale's first battle (begun in 1920) with the government was to get a passport issued to her by the U.S. State Department in her own name – just as for any man.Stannard 1977, pp. 190=91 and 204-208. Victory was attained five years later in 1925, by the League, when the first married woman in the United States to receive a passport in her own name was Doris Fleischman,Stannard 1977, p. 208. the wife of Edward L. Bernays.Stannard 1977, p. 196. An earlier victory for the group came in May 1921 when Hale got a real estate deed issued in her birth name rather than Mrs. Heywood Broun.Stannard 1977, p. 191. For other property deeds, see p. 199. When the time came to transfer the title of the Upper West Side apartment building, Hale refused to go on record as Mrs. Heywood Broun; the papers were changed to Ruth Hale. The League pioneered and fought for other married women's rights, in the 1920s U.S., to do each of the following in their own names: to register at a hotel,Stannard 1977, p. 191. to have bank accounts and sign checks, to have a telephone account or a store account or an insurance policy or a library card,Stannard 1977, p. 199. to register (to vote) and to vote,Stannard 1977, pp. 199-200. to get a copyright,Stannard 1977, pp. 211-12. and to receive paychecks.Stannard 1977, pp. 201-04. Also see p. 239. These rights may be taken for granted today, but the legal right of a married woman in the U.S. to use her own name (rather than her husband's name) was denied by many officials and courts until a 9 Oct 1972 court decision,Stannard 1977, p. 278. as documented in the 1977 book Mrs Man, by Una Stannard.Stannard 1977, p. 238 and all of Ch. 17, Fiat Lex, pp. 239-261. In its first incarnation the League was short lived. The group's lawyer, Rose Bres, died in 1927; by 1931 Ruth Hale, who believed that a woman is \\"through after forty\\", became depressed and then died in 1934. By the early 1930s the Lucy Stone League was inactive.Stannard 1977, p. 218. Second historical period The League was restarted in 1950 by Jane Grant, plus twenty two former members, its first meeting being on 22 Mar 1950 in New York City. Grant promptly won the Census Bureau's agreement that a married woman could use her maiden surname as her official or real name in the census. (The New York Times, 10 Apr 1950).Stannard 1977, p. 262. But the \\"legal stone wall\\" that U.S. women ran into with many officials and even in the courts persisted until the U.S. Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment on 22 Mar 1972 (never ratified by the U.S.).Stannard 1977, pp. 272-77. This 22 Mar 1972 event, plus the researching of and documentation of past legal cases by women lawyers, led to the above-mentioned 9 Oct 1972 court decision.Stannard 1977, pp. 277-78. So in the 1950s and 1960s period, prior to 1972, the \\"new\\" League had to change its approach – it widened its focus to include all discrimination against women in the U.S.; the League became a proto – National Organization for Women (NOW).Stannard 1977, p. 263. The reborn League operated as a non-political and non-partisan center of research and information on the status of women. It sponsored college scholarships and set up feminist libraries in high schools. It worked for gender equality in legal, economic, educational, and social relationships.Stannard 1977, pp. 262-65.http://lucystoneleague.org/history.html The League's official history. To access it from the League's homepage: First click on the tab \\"Who are we?\\", and then on its button \\"LSL History\\". As of the early 1990s the Lucy Stone League \\"still gave nursing scholarships and hosted a combination annual meeting and strawberry festival\\" – though the gender equality issues listed in the previous paragraph had been largely taken over by the National Organization for Women (since 1966) and other women's groups.Parker, Mary Lou or ML (1994). Fashioning feminism: the making of the Lucy Stone League by members and media, 602 pp. University of Oregon. p. 58. Third historical period A modern version of the League was started in 1997, as follows: By 1997 the activities of the League had ceased and a report was published that \\"Alas, the League is no more.\\"Justin Kaplan & Anne Bernays, (7 Feb 1997). The Language of Names. Simon & Schuster. p. 158. When he read this report, Morrison Bonpasse, a past president of the League, was \\"inspired\\" to restart the League, at the same time shifting the focus back to name equality – which was/is not addressed by NOW. This restart eventually became \\"the re-launching of the website (lucystoneleague.org) under the direction of a new board and its current president Ms. Cristina Lucia Stasia\\". In addition, there is a group of women in New York who are still active under the name \\"Lucy Stone League\\" and this group has been a dues paying affiliate of the International Alliance of Women,http://www.womenalliance.org International Alliance of Women. for decades.

Four tramways and one hoist operated on the trail, although all eventually closed before 1900 when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad became the transportation method of choice for remaining prospectors. Peterson Hoist The Peterson Hoist, set up in 1896, was one of the first of semi-permanent gear-hauling infrastructures to be built on the trail. Little is known about P.H. Peterson's hoist, including its location. He may have in fact operated on the adjacent, eponymous Peterson Pass instead of the Chilkoot Pass. Peterson's hoist simply consisted of, according to an observer, a pulley at the top of the pass with a rope running through it. Attached to one end of the rope was a sled with runners and the other a box. Gear would be loaded into the sled while the box would be filled with snow and gravity would work its magic with the snow-filled box pulling the sled up as it went down. Everything would be emptied and the operation repeated. The hoist's simplicity leads to part of the befuddlement over the location, as this hoist left a minimal number of artifacts. On February 17, 1898 Peterson leased the hoist to J.F. Hielscher for the subsequent five months, which were the peak months of the rush. Archie Burns' Tramway Archie Burns, in the spring of 1897, instituted the first tramway on the trail running from the Scales to the false summit on the Chilkoot Pass. The tramway was horse-powered but also combined its services with manual hauling services from Dyea to The Scales. In the winter of 1897-1898 the tram was purchased by Juneau merchant C.W. Young and the tram and associated hauling services became C.W. Young Freighting and Trading Company with Burns remaining as manager. As early as December 1897 or as late as February 1898 (the precise date is unknown), the newly coined C.W. Young Tramway upgraded from horse power to steam power. With the less- developed Peterson Hoist as its only competition, the C.W. Tramway was heavily used and profits rolled in. By late February 1898, the tram was hauling over five tons of freight daily with its rates changing upon demand. Later, for unknown reasons, Burns decided to supplement the steam-powered tram with a gasoline powered hoist operating in a similar manner to the Peterson Hoist except using gasoline power instead of a gravity counterweight. In January 1899 Burns purchased the tram and hauling infrastructure back from C.W. Young for $5,000 as the number of prospectors taking the Chilkoot dwindled. Either the end of that winter or the beginning of that spring, Burns closed his tram for the last time leaving Southeast Alaska for Nome, Alaska. He came back in 1900, however, only to reclaim the valuable portions of machinery although many artifacts from his operation remain as artifacts on the trail today. Dyea-Klondike Transportation Company (DKT) Aerial tramway powerhouse, Dyea-Klondike Transportation Company, ca. 1898 The Dyea-Klondike Transportation Company (DKT) came into the Chilkoot Trail scene in the fall of 1897 with ambitious plans. It originally set out to build a \\"narrow gauge tramroad like those used in mines\\" from their wharf in Dyea up to The Scales. From there an aerial tramway would haul gear up and over the pass creating a comprehensive freight transportation system from the waters of Lynn Canal all the way into Canada. However, like many ideas tossed around during gold rush days, this one fell through after the company, which was located in Portland, Oregon, ran into financial difficulties. The operation was subsequently scaled back and replaced the planned tramroad with horses, although plans for an aerial tram at the pass remained. The DKT Co was based in Tacoma, and used professional engineering services. A Bleichert style tramway was built using Trenton Iron Works parts. During construction in the Spring of 1898 construction crews were killed by both a meningitis outbreak and a bad avalanche. Finally, the crews managed to erect towers and string the heavy steel cables. On March 17, 1898, the DKT opened its aerial tramway proudly announcing it to be \\"the only tramway in the world powered by electricity.\\" This turned out to be true, with the electricity originating from the company's Canyon City power plant which was originally created to power the tramroad. Ruins of a steam boiler exist at the location. Seven miles of power lines from Canyon City up to The Scales carried the electricity to the tramroad. The tramway ruined Archie Burns'/C.W. Young's monopoly on tramways on the pass and, for just under a month, it was the only aerial tramway over the pass. The tramway's history as an independent company turned out to be relatively short. In June 1898, four months after the tramway opened, the Dyea-Klondike Transportation Company merged with both the Alaska Railroad and Transportation Company and Chilkoot Railroad and Transport Company (the other two substantial tram companies in operation) for a more cooperative and coordinated operation. In June 1899, one year after the merger, the conglomerate tram company was purchased by the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad to prevent competition and began to be scrapped in the fall of 1899. Alaska Railroad and Transportation Company (AR&T;) The Alaska Railroad and Transportation Company (AR&T;) was the second most-developed tramway system on the Chilkoot Trail, the second of three aerial tramways to be constructed, and also the second to last tramway to be constructed. The AR&T;, under the jurisdiction of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, showered interest in the Chilkoot Trail area around December 1897 by purchasing tidewater property for a wharf in Dyea and building freight depots at both Dyea and near Sheep Camp. The company's intentions, as its name reveals, was to build a railroad up to The Scales and construct an aerial tram from there over the pass. While it is not known how the concept of a railroad was dropped soon after the company's creation, the railroad portion of construction was no longer pursued. Construction began and sometime around May 1898, the gas-powered, long aerial tramway was completed. Unlike the three other tram companies, AR&T;'s operation consisted only of the tramway, with no horse-hauling services or other subcontracted services. The tramway, however, was far superior to the Dyea-Klondike Company's tram in terms of weight able to be carried, length, and strength but its spell as the dominant freight agent in the Taiya River valley was short-lived as well. Soon the Chilkoot Railroad and Transport Company finished construction on their longer, more durable, and more comprehensive system and by June of the same year all three tram companies merged and began charging uniform rates. It is believed that the tram operated until June 1899 when it was purchased by the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad which was aiming to clear competition for its services. By March 1900, workers had cleared everything of value from the tram line leaving only empty wooden structures. Chilkoot Railroad and Transport Company (CR&T;) Chilkoot Trail tramway in forest, 1898 The Chilkoot Railroad and Transport Company (CR&T;) was the largest, most comprehensive, and last of the Chilkoot Trail tramways to be constructed. At first, envisionaries toyed with a horse- drawn tramroad and even a railroad going straight up the Taiya River valley, but financial restraints tempered these plans. The company settled on a wagon road to Canyon City, a two-stage aerial tram system (Canyon City to Sheep Camp and Sheep Camp to Stone Crib), and contracted packing services from Stone Crib to Lake Lindeman. This system enabled the company to be the first to offer an integrated transportation option that would transfer prospectors' gear from the wharfs of Dyea to the headwaters of the Yukon River (i.e., Lake Lindeman and Lindeman City). Construction began in December 1897 and both trams began running by May 1898. While CR&T; merged with the Alaska Railroad Transportation Company and the Dyea-Klondike Transportation Company just a month after CR&T; opened its trams, its infrastructure was heavily used well into June 1899 when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad construction reached Lake Bennett in British Columbia effectively rendering CR&T; obsolete. Even then, however, CR&T;'s freight rates were comparable to those of the railroad and so in 1899 White Pass and Yukon Route purchased the Chilkoot Railroad and Transportation Company's trams and began dismantling them beginning in January 1900 and finishing by April of the same year.

She is mainly remembered as the beautiful blonde actress who appeared in many of The Three Stooges shorts produced by Columbia Pictures. Early career A native of Nogales, Arizona,The Nogales Chamber.com Christine McIntyre was one of five children. A classically trained singer, McIntyre received a Bachelor of Music degree at Chicago Musical College in 1933. It was here that she developed her operatic soprano voice, which would be put to good use in several Three Stooges films in the 1940s. McIntyre began singing in feature films at RKO Pictures, and made her film debut in 1937's Swing Fever. She then appeared in a series of B-westerns featuring the likes of Ray Corrigan and Buck Jones. She appeared with dark hair in these early roles, and also appeared occasionally in \\"mainstream\\" feature films (like 1939's Blondie Takes a Vacation). She sang songs such as \\"The Blue Danube\\" and \\"Voices of Spring\\" in a Vienna-themed short Soundies musical film, and her performance was singled out as the best of the inaugural series. Her singing in this soundie may have given the Three Stooges the idea of using \\"Voices of Spring\\" in their short film Micro-Phonies. The Three Stooges and Columbia Pictures It was in 1944 that Columbia Pictures producer Hugh McCollum signed Christine McIntyre to a decade-long contract. During her time at Columbia, she appeared in many short subjects starring Shemp Howard, Harry Langdon, Andy Clyde, Joe Besser, Bert Wheeler, and Hugh Herbert. The Herbert comedy Wife Decoy is actually a showcase for McIntyre, who is the principal character. In this film, she appears as a brunette who dyes her hair blonde. From then on in her screen appearances, she remained a blonde. In all of her Columbia comedies she demonstrated a capable range, playing charming heroines, scheming villains, and flighty socialites equally well. McIntyre's association with the Three Stooges would become her most memorable. Her debut appearance with the team was in Idle Roomers, followed by a solo Shemp Howard short, Open Season for Saps. McIntyre's singing voice was featured prominently in 1945's Micro- Phonies, as she sang both \\"Voices of Spring\\" and \\"Lucia Sextet.\\" She would again sing \\"Lucia Sextet\\" three years later in Squareheads of the Round Table and its 1954 remake, Knutzy Knights. Her performance as Miss Hopkins in Brideless Groom featured a knockabout scene in which she beats voice instructor Shemp Howard into submission. Director Edward Bernds remembers: Producer McCollum and director Bernds recognized Christine McIntyre's abilities, and often tailored material especially for her, allowing her to improvise as she saw fit. McIntyre also won a feature-film contract with Monogram Pictures. After playing a newspaper publisher in News Hounds, a comedy with The Bowery Boys, she usually played opposite Monogram's cowboy stars in low-budget Westerns. Her attractive features belied that she was close to 40 years of age at the time, much more mature than the conventional ingenue. McIntyre married radio personality John Donald Wilson in 1953. By this time, her mentors Hugh McCollum and Edward Bernds had left Columbia, leaving Jules White in charge of short subjects. White favored strenuous, extremely physical humor, and forced the ladylike McIntyre to submit to low comedy; in a single film, her character was tackled, hit with messy projectiles, covered with cake batter, and knocked into a cross-eyed stupor. When her contract at Columbia expired in 1954, she was all too happy to retire from show business, eventually developing a career in real estate. Columbia continued to use old footage of McIntyre through 1960, which is why she received billing in films made after her retirement.threestooges.net Death Wilson's sudden death from a heart attack on January 26, 1984 at age 79 took its toll on McIntyre. She was already suffering from cancer at the time of his passing, and his death worsened her illness. McIntyre died in Van Nuys, California on July 8, 1984, at age 73, almost six months after her husband. The two are interred in the same plot at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.
