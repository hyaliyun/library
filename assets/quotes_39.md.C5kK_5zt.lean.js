He was probably a son of Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde, who may have been related to previous rulers of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Originally centred in the valley of the River Clyde, this realm appears to have undergone considerable southward expansion in the ninth or tenth century, after which it increasing came to be known as the Kingdom of Cumbria. Owain may have represented the Cumbrians in the tripartite alliance with the kingdoms of Alba and Mercia, assembled by √Üthelfl√¶d, Lady of the Mercians in the second decade of the tenth century. Around this time, the Cumbrians are recorded to have campaigned against either Ragnall ua √çmair or Sitric C√°ech. Owain may also be the king of Strathclyde who is recorded to have submitted to √Üthelfl√¶d's brother, Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons, in 920 with Ragnall and Custant√≠n mac √Åeda, King of Alba. Moreover, Owain seems to have been present at another assembly in 927, when he, Custant√≠n, Ealdred (son of Eadwulf), and perhaps Owain ap Hywel, King of Gwent, acknowledged overlordship of Edward's son and successor, √Üthelstan. This assembly may have been held on or near the River Eamont, seemingly the southern frontier of the Cumbrian kingdom. Owain is first securely attested in 934, when √Üthelstan invaded and ravaged the Scottish Kingdom of Alba and seemingly Strathclyde as well. In the aftermath of this campaign, both Owain and Custant√≠n are known to have been present at √Üthelstan's royal court, witnessing several charters as ' of the Englishman. Three years later, the Scots and Cumbrians allied themselves with Amla√≠b mac Gofraid against the English at the Battle of Brunanburh. It is possible that Owain is identical to the unnamed Cumbrian king recorded to have participated in this defeat by the English. If he was indeed present, he could have been amongst the dead. His son Dyfnwal ab Owain is recorded to have ruled as King of Strathclyde within a few years. Background Locations relating to Owain's life and times.

The catalyst for this southern extension may have been the dramatic decline of the Kingdom of Northumbria at the hands of conquering Scandinavians,Lewis (2016) p. 15; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 9, 481‚Äì482; Breeze (2006) pp. 327, 331; Hicks (2003) pp. 35‚Äì36, 36 n. 78; Woolf (2001a); Macquarrie (1998) p. 19; Fellows-Jensen (1991) p. 80. and the expansion may have been facilitated by cooperation between the Cumbrians and insular Scandinavians in the late ninth- and early tenth century.Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 481‚Äì482.

Alternately, Dyfnwal could have represented a more distant branch of the same dynasty.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 4.

If the eleventh-century Fragmentary Annals of Ireland is to be believed, at some point between 911 and 918, √Üthelfl√¶d, Lady of the Mercians orchestrated an alliance of Mercians, Scots, and Cumbrians, to combat the increasing menace of insular Scandinavians. The compact stipulated that, in the event that one of these three peoples were attacked, the others would come to their aid. The Cumbrians and Scots are further stated to have succeeded in destroying several Scandinavian settlements.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4, 4 n. 8; Walker (2013) ch. 3; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2010) ¬ß 459; Davidson (2001) p. 203; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2008) ¬ß 459; Costambeys (2004); Davidson (2002) p. 61, 61 n. 157; Davidson (2001) p. 203; Hicks (2003) p. 36; Hudson (1994) p. 68; Anderson (1922) p. 402. If this record is indeed accurate, one possibility is that, whilst the Scots focused upon Argyll and the Hebrides, the Cumbrians could have concentrated their efforts against the Scandinavian colonies in the Solway Firth.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4. Although the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland states that a Scandinavian king \\"sacked Strathclyde and plundered the land\\", this attack is also said to have been \\"ineffectual\\".Clarkson (2014) ch. 4, 4 n. 8; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2010) ¬ß 459; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2008) ¬ß 459; Hicks (2003) p. 36; Hudson (1994) p. 68; Anderson (1922) pp. 402‚Äì403. The unnamed attacking monarch may have been Ragnall ua √çmair, who likely controlled territory in western Northumbria at about this time.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9. Another candidate is Sitriuc C√°ech, an U√≠ √çmair kinsman of Ragnall, who is stated by the same source to have seized the kingship of Dublin before the attack.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4, 4 n. 8; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2010) ¬ß 459; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2008) ¬ß 459; Anderson (1922) p. 401. The leader of the Scots at that time was Custant√≠n mac √Åeda, King of Alba. The record of Dyfnwal's death before 915, and the evidence of Owain ruling the Kingdom of Strathclyde in the later decades, suggests that he succeeded Dyfnwal as king,Clarkson (2014) ch. 4; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9. and represented the realm in the alliance. The Cumbrians are not recorded to have received any assistance from √Üthelfl√¶d; this could indicate that they were attacked after her death in 918.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4.

Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). In the year of √Üthelfl√¶d's death, Ragnall and the Scots fought the bloody but inconclusive Battle of Corbridge, a clash attested by sources such as the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, the ninth- to twelfth-century Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, and the tenth- or eleventh-century Historia de sancto Cuthberto. The conflict appears to have been associated with Custant√≠n's attempt to reinsert the exiled Northumbrian magnate Ealdred, son of Eadwulf, into western Northumbria.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4, 4 n. 31; Walker (2013) chs. 2, 3; The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 918.4; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Woolf (2010) pp. 226‚Äì227; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 918.4; Woolf (2007) pp. 142‚Äì144; Hudson (2004a); Hudson (1998) pp. 150, 157; Anderson (1922) pp. 406‚Äì407, 406 n. 3, 446; Anderson (1908) p. 64; Arnold (1882) pp. 208‚Äì209 ch. 22; Hodgson Hinde (1868) p. 147; Skene (1867) p. 9. Although the presence of Cumbrians in the campaign is not specifically recorded, it is possible that they too participated in the operations against the insular Scandinavians.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9.

Despite the chronicle's claim of Edward's received submission, there is reason to suspect that the event was more a negotiation of sorts‚Äîperhaps an agreement concerning the recent reorientation of the political map. For example, Edward had recently gained control of Mercia and parts of Northumbria, while Ragnall acquired York in 919.Ryan (2013a) p. 301; Walker (2013) ch. 3; Davidson (2001) p. 209; Duncan (2002) p. 23 n. 51.

One possibility is that the Scots and Cumbrians were bound not to attack Ragnall's territories in Northumbria as long as Ragnall refrained from conspiring against Edward's authority.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 15. The account of Ragnall's attacks upon the Cumbrians preserved by the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland seems to indicate that he was regarded as a serious threat.Molyneaux (2015) p. 77 n. 128. The evidence of Cumbrian southward expansion certainly suggests that Owain's realm shared several borders with the insular Scandinavians: an eastern front along the Pennines, a southern front along the River Eamont, and a western front along the coast and perhaps in Galloway.Clarkson (2014) ch. 4 ¬∂ 34.

Certainly, it is an otherwise well-attested phenomenon of mediaeval European monarchs to negotiate with their neighbours on their common territorial boundaries.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 512; Stenton (1963) p. 328. In fact, the contemporary Latin poem Carta, dirige gressus seems to not only corroborate the meeting itself,Keynes (2015) pp. 78‚Äì79, 90; Foot (2011a); Downham (2007) pp. 100‚Äì101; Little (2007) pp. 340‚Äì343; Davidson (2002) pp. 20, 66, 79‚Äì80; Lapidge (1980) pp. 87, 90‚Äì93; Wright; Halliwell (1845) p. 179. but may further evince the assembly's importance to the Cumbrians. Specifically, the poem states that Custant√≠n hastened to ' in order to render his submission, and it is possible that this terminology refers to the Cumbrian realm (as opposed to the entire island of Britain).Keynes (2015) pp. 78‚Äì79; Smith (2014) p. 85; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 2, 512; Davidson (2002) pp. 79‚Äì80; Lapidge (1993) p. 86. The sources that note the assembly, therefore, may reveal that it took place near the River Eamont at Dacre.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 512. Another possibility is that the meeting was set in the vicinity of Eamont Bridge, between the River Eamont and the River Lowther.McGuigan (2015b) pp. 112‚Äì113; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Wood (2013) p. 140; Foot (2011a); Foot (2011b) p. 162, 162 n. 14; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Davies, JR (2009) p. 73 n. 40; Woolf (2007) pp. 151‚Äì152; Dalton (2006) p. 14; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 104; Woolf (2001a); Stenton (1963) p. 328. Not far from this location are two prehistoric henges (Mayburgh Henge and King Arthur's Round Table) and the remains of a Roman fort (Brocavum), any of which could have served as the venue for an important assembly.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 9; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Woolf (2007) p. 152 n. 55; Williams (1999) p. 190 n. 28; Lapidge (1980) pp. 91‚Äì92 n. 140. Whatever the case, √Üthelstan's assembly in the north, and another convened near the Welsh border not long after, marked a turning point in the history of Britain. Not only did √Üthelstan claim kingship over all the English peoples of Britain, but positioned himself as overking of Britain itself.Foot (2011a); Foot (2011b) p. 20; Davies, RR (2000) pp. 36‚Äì37. √Üthelstan's invasion of 934 The name of Gofraid ua √çmair as it appears on folio 29v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489.The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 921.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 921.5; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). In 934, the concordat between √Üthelstan and the northern kings collapsed in dramatic fashion, with the former launching an invasion into the north.Holland (2016) chs.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that the English king penetrated into Alba with both land forces and maritime forces, and thereby ravaged much of the realm.Molyneaux (2015) pp. 30, 52‚Äì53; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Foot (2011a); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 109; Halloran (2005) p. 137; Davidson (2002) p. 96, 96 n. 108; Whitelock (1996) p. 221; Anderson (1908) p. 67. Preparations for this massive undertaking appear to be evidenced by several royal charters dating to May and June of that year.Keynes (2015) pp. 84‚Äì85 fig. 1, 90‚Äì91; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 515 tab. 16.1; Wood (2013) pp. 140‚Äì141; Foot (2011a); Molyneaux (2011) p. 68, 68 n. 36; Davidson (2002) pp. 96‚Äì97, 98‚Äì99; Hudson (1994) p. 76; Halloran (n.d.) n. 9; S 425 (n.d.); S 407 (n.d.). The same sources appear to reveal that √Üthelstan was supported on his campaign by the Welsh potentates Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, King of Gwynedd, and Morgan ab Owain, King of Gwent.Keynes (2015) pp. 84‚Äì85 fig. 1, 90‚Äì91; Molyneaux (2015) p. 61; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 511‚Äì512, 515 tab. 16.1; Davidson (2002) pp. 96‚Äì97; S 425 (n.d.); S 407 (n.d.). The fullest account of the English campaign is preserved by the twelfth-century Historia regum Anglorum, a source which states that √Üthelstan's land forces marched as far as Dunnottar and ', and that his maritime forces reached as far as ' (seemingly Caithness).Molyneaux (2015) p. 30; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5, 5 n. 20; Wood (2013) pp. 140‚Äì141; Foot (2011a); Foot (2011b) p. 23; Molyneaux (2011) p. 74; Halloran (2005) p. 137; Davidson (2002) p. 104, 104 n. 137; Hudson (1994) p. 77; Anderson (1908) p. 68; Arnold (1885) p. 93 ch. 83; Stevenson (1855) pp. 482, 502. According to the twelfth-century Libellus de exordio, Owain and the Cumbrians were caught up in campaign, with Owain and his Scottish counterpart, Custant√≠n, being put to flight by √Üthelstan's forces.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Broun (2004) p. 129; Davidson (2002) p. 104, 104 n. 138; Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 65; Hudson (1994) p. 72; Anderson (1908) p. 68; Arnold (1882) p. 76 bk. 2 ch. 18; Stevenson (1855) p. 669 ch. 33. The Cumbrian realm, therefore, seems to have endured the same fate as that of the Scots.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5. The reasons behind √Üthelstan's campaign are uncertain. One possibility is that Owain and Custant√≠n had broke certain pledges that they had rendered to the English in 927.Molyneaux (2015) pp. 77‚Äì78; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Davidson (2002) p. 95; Halloran (n.d.). Perhaps the latter reneged on a promise to render homage.Clarkson (2012a) ch. 9. According to Chronicon ex chronicis the King of Alba had indeed broke a treaty with √Üthelstan, and that the former was forced to give up a son as an English hostage.Firth (2018) p. 46; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Foot (2011a); Halloran (2005) p. 137, 137 n. 25; Davidson (2002) p. 95, 95 n. 103, 104, 104 n. 140; Whitelock (1996) p. 222 n. 2; Anderson (1908) pp. 67 n. 4, 69; Forester (1854) p. 97; Stevenson (1853) pp. 241‚Äì242; Thorpe (1848) pp. 131‚Äì132; Halloran (n.d.). Similarly, Gesta regum Anglorum states that √Üthelstan invaded Alba because Custant√≠n's realm was \\"again in revolt\\".Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Giles (1847) p. 129 bk. 2 ch. 4; Hardy (1840) p. 206 bk 2 ch. 131. Whether the invasion was unprovoked or orchestrated in revenge, it and another campaign directed against the Cumbrians eleven years later, could well have been utilised by the English Cerdicing dynasty as a way to overawe and intimidate neighbouring potentates.Molyneaux (2015) pp. 77‚Äì78. The Giant's Grave, a collection of apparent tenth-century monuments at Penrith. The stones display significant Scandinavian influences, and are traditionally associated with a legendary king, variably known as Owain Caesarius. It is possible that this figure refers to Owain, or any of the tenth and eleventh-century Cumbrian kings who bore the same name.Clarkson (2010) ch. 10; Proceedings (1947) pp. 221‚Äì225; Collingwood (1923). Surviving charter evidence, dating to September 934, reveals that the defeated Custant√≠n submitted to √Üthelstan, and was then in the latter's presence witnessing a charter to one of English king's household men.Firth (2018) p. 46; Holland (2016) ch. Northumbria ¬∂ 18; Keynes (2015) pp. 84‚Äì85 fig. 1, 91, 105; Broun (2007) p. 88; Woolf (2007) pp. 166‚Äì167; Davidson (2002) pp. 96‚Äì97, 104, 104 n. 139; Birch (1887) pp. 407‚Äì408 ¬ß 704; S 426 (n.d.). The actual record of this charter is preserved by a fourteenth-century chartulary. Such mediaeval chartularies commonly abbreviated witness lists. Remarkably, no Welsh potentates are recorded by the witness list which could indicate that their names were not preserved by the chartulary. If correct, Owain himself could have been amongst the witnesses as well.Keynes (2015) p. 91. In any case, Owain certainly seems to have spent time in √Üthelstan's court, attesting several of the latter's royal charters.Firth (2018) p. 46 n. 73; Holland (2016) ch. Northumbria ¬∂ 19; Molyneaux (2015) pp. 30 n. 71, 57, 57 n. 43; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5, 5 n. 27; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 516; Wood (2013) pp. 140‚Äì141; Foot (2011b) pp. 84 n. 86, 89, 92; Maddicott (2010).

The ordering of the witness lists in √Üthelstan's surviving charters seems to reveal the eminent standing Owain enjoyed amongst his royal peers,Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Woolf (2007) p. 167, 167 n. 86. and suggests that he was regarded as the third most powerful king in Britain, after Custant√≠n and √Üthelstan.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5. The fact that Custant√≠n is not known to have attested any English charters before 934 could indicate that his absence from √Üthelstan's court was an act of calculated insubordination. As such, the English invasion of 934 could well have been punitive in nature, and its success may be partly exemplified by Custant√≠n's appearance in the witness list of the September 934 charter, in which he is the first recorded ' amongst others.Firth (2018) p. 46; Birch (1887) pp. 407‚Äì408 ¬ß 704; S 426 (n.d.).

After 935, none of √Üthelstan's ' are recorded in the king's presence.Keynes (2015) pp. 92‚Äì93.

Although the Cumbrians are not specifically mentioned by the text,Dunshea (2012) p. 13 n. 11; Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Cowen (2004) p. 96. it is possible that the composer chose to leave them out due to technical constraints regarding the piece's metre and structure.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Cowen (2004) p. 96. By leaving out the Cumbrians and Owain, the poem presents the opposing sides symmetrically: the West Saxons and Mercians‚Äîled by √Üthelstan and Edmund I‚Äîversus the Scandinavians and Scots‚Äîled by Amla√≠b and Custant√≠n.Cowen (2004) p. 96. Perhaps the Cumbrians' part in the conflict was overshadowed by the combatants;Downham (2007) pp. 165‚Äì166. or maybe the poem's composer merely regarded Amla√≠b's supporters to be sufficiently represented by the Scots alone.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5. In any event, if Owain was indeed a participant in the conflict, it is possible that he was amongst those who perished.Hicks (2003) p. 38 n. 85; Woolf (2001a); Williams (1999) pp. 85‚Äì86.

It is possible that the scale of the casualties at Brunanburh‚Äîwhich seem to have weakened √Üthelstan's forces as well as those of his opponents‚Äîcould have been seized upon by the Cumbrians to further enable their expansion. √Üthelstan's death in 939 would have also provided another window of opportunity to consolidate such territorial gains.Hicks (2003) p. 38. In any event, it seems likely that either Owain, or his succeeding son Dyfnwal, submitted to √Üthelstan soon after the clash at Brunanburh.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9.

Drug carriers are primarily used to control the release of a drug into systemic circulation. This can be accomplished either by slow release of the drug over a long period of time (typically diffusion) or by triggered release at the drug's target by some stimulus, such as changes in pH, application of heat, and activation by light. Drug carriers are also used to improve the pharmacokinetic properties, specifically the bioavailability, of many drugs with poor water solubility and/or membrane permeability. A wide variety of drug carrier systems have been developed and studied, each of which has unique advantages and disadvantages. Some of the more popular types of drug carriers include liposomes, polymeric micelles, microspheres, and nanoparticles. Different methods of attaching the drug to the carrier have been implemented, including adsorption, integration into the bulk structure, encapsulation, and covalent bonding. Different types of drug carrier utilize different methods of attachment, and some carriers can even implement a variety of attachment methods. Carrier types =Liposomes= Liposomes are structures which consist of at least one lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core. This hydrophobic/hydrophilic composition is particularly useful for drug delivery as these carriers can accommodate a number of drugs of varying lipophilicity. Disadvantages associated with using liposomes as drug carriers involve poor control over drug release. Drugs which have high membrane- permeability can readily 'leak' from the carrier, while optimization of in vivo stability can cause drug release by diffusion to be a slow and inefficient process. Much of the current research involving liposomes is focused on improving the delivery of anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. =Polymeric micelles= Polymeric micelles are drug carriers formed by the aggregation of some amphiphilic molecule with an amphiphilic block copolymer. These carriers form at some high concentration specific to the compounds used, called the critical micelle concentration. The addition of an amphiphilic block copolymer effectively lowers this critical micelle concentration by shifting the monomer exchange equilibrium. These carriers are comparable to liposomes, however the lack of an aqueous core makes polymeric micelles less accommodating to a wide variety of drugs. =Microspheres= Microspheres are hollow, micron-sized carriers often formed via self-assembly of polymeric compounds which are most often used to encapsulate the active drug for delivery. Drug release is often achieved by diffusion through pores in the microsphere structure or by degradation of the microsphere shell. Some of the research currently being done uses advanced assembly techniques, such as precision particle fabrication (PPF), to create microspheres capable of sustained control over drug release. =Nanostructures= Nanodiamonds Nanodiamonds (NDs) are carbon nanoparticles which can vary from ~4-100 nm in diameter. NDs are typically formed in two ways: from micron-sized diamond particles under high-pressure high-temperature conditions, called high- pressure high-temperature nanodiamonds (HPHT NDs) and by shock-wave compression, called detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs). The surfaces of these NDs can be modified by processes such as oxidation and aminification to alter adsorption properties. =Nanofibers= =Protein-DNA complexes= =Protein-drug conjugates= =Erythrocytes= =Virosomes= =Dendrimers= Resources The following research papers from IUPAC are in pdf format: *Biodegradable hydrogels for bone regeneration through growth factor release *Development of acid-sensitive copolymer micelles for drug delivery  References  External links *Weighting cancer drugs to make them hit tumors harder PhysOrg.com article *Designing Better Cancer Drugs Provides insight into carrier molecules' functionality which may yield safer cancer treatments.

He was killed in a US drone strike in South Waziristan, FATA, Pakistan in 2004. This was the first CIA drone strike inside Pakistan.A Secret Deal on Drones, Sealed in Blood April 6, 2013 New York Times. Retrieved 21 April 2013. Early life Nek Muhammad belonged to the Yargul Khail subclan of the Ahmadzai Wazir Pashtun tribe. According to Pakistan's Dawn News, his father: Nek's father, Nawaz Khan, was a member of the tribal elite and owned property in the village of Kalosha, South Waziristan, close to the Afghanistan border: Nek Muhammad was his second child. Muhammad was expelled from one madrassa for poor discipline. He received his early education at an Islamic school run by Jamiat-i-Ulema-i- Islam leader Maulana Noor Mohammed. Nek studied for five years at the Jamia Darul Uloom Waziristan. One of his teachers stated that he was a strong-willed student: He was later admitted to a college run by the Awami National Party (ANP), but did not complete his studies, choosing instead to start a shop in the main bazaar of Wana. Role in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War Wana was a significant training base for Mujahideen fighters during the 1980s Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Around the age of 19, Muhammad joined the Mujahideen rebels, recruited by his friend Mohammad Gul. He and Gul served with the forces of Saifullah Mansoor of Shah-i Kot. He, along with Mansoor, likely would have transferred his allegiance to the Taliban in 1995 or 1996. He rose rapidly in the ranks, becoming a sub-commander of a Waziri Taliban unit, and fighting in battles against the Northern Alliance forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Bagram, Bamyan and Panjshir. He reportedly ultimately led a force of 3,000 Taliban at one time. During this period he reportedly met al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at the Rash Khor training camp, south of Kabul. He also met bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and reportedly also became friends-in- arms with Taliban minister Mullah Nazir, the leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Tahir Yaldashev, and Uighur separatist leader Hasan Mahsum. After the Taliban regime fell in late 2001, Muhammad returned to Wana, and from there reportedly facilitated the escape of many other Taliban and foreign fighters from Afghanistan. Return to Waziristan Muhammad formed a new organization called Jaishul al-Qiba al-Jihadi al-Siri al-Alami. This group allegedly ran training camps in South Waziristan for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and produced anti-Western literature and videos for indoctrination purposes. He reportedly became quite wealthy at this time, owning over 40 vehicles by December, 2003. Some members of this group were also recruited into Jundullah, a militant anti-government organization. Jundullah members Attaur Rehman and Abu Musab al-Balochi (al-Baloshi) would later be implicated in the attempted assassination of a senior military official in Karachi. Jundullah's media studio, Ummat, was allegedly connected with Al-Qaeda's media front organization, the Al-Sahab Foundation, and Jundullah itself with Al-Qaeda leader Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Ummat also produced anti-Western and anti- government videos. In April 2004, Muhammed, as leader of anti-government militant forces in South Waziristan fighting in the Waziristan War, accepted an offer of a cease-fire and amnesty with Pakistani forces. The ceasefire lasted only briefly before conflict resumed, however. Death At the time of his death Mohammad was accused of having provided a safe haven for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, and also to fighters from Chechnya and other conflicts. When he was killed the Voice of America called Mohammad an \\"al Qaida facilitator\\". Only a day after the famous Shakai agreement with Pakistan's military in April 2004, in a long interview with the Voice of America Pashto Correspondent Mukhtar Ahmad, Nek Mohammad disclosed that he would never abandon his jihad against the US and other allied forces in Afghanistan. A few miles away from Wana, in this face-to-face radio interview, Mohammad vowed to continue his support for Al-Qaeda and Taliban, and argued that no peace agreement with the Pakistani government can compel him to force the Al-Qaeda fighters and other foreign militants to leave the Pakistan's tribal area. Despite Nek Mohammad's hatred for the US and Western media, he often appeared on their Pashto channels. He had stated on several occasions that VOA and Radio Azadi were the mouthpieces of US government, and that its broadcasters and reporters are the 'paid agents' or 'spies' for the USA. On 18 June 2004, after signing the Shakai Peace deal, he was killed in a missile attack. The Pakistani army stated that it was responsible for Muhammad's death, but PBS Frontline reported in 2006 that he had actually been killed along with four other suspected militants and two children by a missile from an American Predator UAV, allegedly as they sat eating dinner. According to Mark Mazzetti, author of The Way of the Knife: The CIA, a Secret Army, and a War at the Ends of the Earth, the killing of Nek Muhammed, who had been marked by Pakistan as an enemy of the state, was a condition for a secret deal between the USA and Pakistan to allow the use by the CIA of drones in Pakistan airspace to kill individuals designated as enemies of the USA.

Early history In 1913, Al Munro Elias and his brother Walter established the Al Munro Elias Bureau in New York City. At first they sold printed scorecards with baseball data directly to fans, until The Telegram daily newspaper purchased their weekly compilation of \\"averages\\" in 1916. Elias was appointed official statistician of the National League and International League in 1919 with the American League and other minor leagues to follow.\\"Al Munro Elias\\". International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame -- The home page says, \\"Sourced from Jewish Sports Legends, by Joseph Siegman, published by Potomac Books\\". In 1937, the Elias brothers assumed publication of Charley White's Record Book, the so-called Little Red Book, after the death of its originator.AP New London. \\"Al Munro Elias dies at 67\\". New London CT: The Day 2 Aug 1939. AP St. Petersburg. \\"Al Munro Elias called by death\\". St Petersburg FL: The Evening Independent 1 Aug 1939. It became an official (authorized) source for major league records. In 1938, the Bureau began producing the Pocket Cyclopedia of Major League Baseball, and for many years published the official Green Book, the National League's annual summary. Baseball scorekeeping is a popular activity with baseball spectators, but there is only one official scorer for a game of baseball. The development of the Elias business was described in 1942: :Each day the official scorer sends to the league secretary an official scoring blank, properly filled out. This is a quarto sized sheet and contains an amazing amount of information, covering every phase of the game and every player's credits and discredits. From these sheets, the league secretary issues his weekly averages, which go to each team and the newspapers. Because the league sometimes can't issue its data fast enough, several syndicates which deal largely in baseball statistics have been formed, the best known is that run by Al Munro Elias. All the large papers in the country subscribe to his service, and it is from his figures that the daily features of the sports pages ‚Äì the five leading batters, the five leading home-run hitters, etc. ‚Äì are compiled.Victor O. Jones (1942) \\"Box Score\\", pages 162‚Äì182 in Newsmen‚Äôs Holiday, Books for Libraries Press, Freeport, New York Sports Bureau After the Elias brothers died in the 1940s, the company was managed by Lester Goodman. Seymour Siwoff, who had worked for the Elias brothers as a high school student before serving his country in World War II and earning the Purple Heart, returned to become the company's accountant. In 1952, after Lester Goodman's sudden death, Siwoff purchased the company from the widows of the Elias brothers. The new company was renamed Elias Sports Bureau to better fulfill Siwoff's vision of incorporating all professional sports, and Siwoff took the company into the computer age. Under Siwoff's leadership for over 60 years and to the present, ESB has become the leading authority on sports statistics. Originally official statistician of Major League Baseball, Siwoff was able to add to this distinction the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, and the Arena Football League. More recently, ESB added pro-women's basketball (WNBA) and pro-golf to its list of league clientele. ESB also is a primary source of statistics for national newspapers, magazines and websites, as well as dozens of broadcasters of MLB, NBA and NHL telecasts. With Sporting News having phased out its record book publishing business during 2007, The Elias Book of Baseball Records appears to be the sole hard-copy source of official baseball records. This book is available only through the company website. Steve Hirdt, executive vice-president, added his skills as a sports writer. His first venture was writing for ESPN's Page2 website for a brief time. Later, he moved to a column for ESPN The Magazine. The column is entitled \\"Do the Math\\" and focuses on sports statistics. Elias rankings At the end of each baseball season, Elias compiles rankings for each player based upon performance over the two most recent seasons. For many years, these rankings were used to place players into three tiers of value: Type A (top 20 percent of rankings), Type B (next 20 percent of rankings), or Non Compensation (remaining 60 percent). This was changed in the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement which eliminated Type C free agents and restricted Type A free agents from the top 30% to the top 20% and correspondingly shifted Type B free agents, and the effects were first experienced in the 2007 offseason. The type determined what kind of draft pick a team will receive as compensation if its player signs with another team: * If a Type A free agent is signed by a different team, the signing team must compensate the player's former team with its first round draft pick in the next rule 4 Amateur Draft. However, if the signing team's first round pick is in the top 15 then it surrenders its second round pick instead. Also the player's former team receives a \\"sandwich\\" pick in between the first and second rounds.The surrendering of draft picks becomes more complicated if the signing team signs more than one type A free agent. In this instance the signing team surrenders its highest available pick to the former team that had the better free agent, based upon Elias ratings. For example, suppose a team that has a top 15 pick in the first round signs two type A free agents: Player 1, who had a rating of 70, and Player 2, who had a rating of 65. The signing team would surrender its second round pick to the former team of the Player 1 and its third round pick to the former team of Player 2. * If a Type B free agent is signed by a different team, the old team receives a \\"sandwich\\" pick in between the first and second rounds and the signing team loses no draft pick. * If a Non Compensation free agent is signed, no compensatory picks are awarded to the player's former team. The Elias rankings were eliminated from free agent compensation after the 2011 season.

It is located in the Aleppo Governorate of Syria and Kilis Province of Turkey. The Kurd mountain should not be confused with the neighboring Jabal al Akrad (Kurds' mountain) which is located further southwest towards the mediterranean coastline. Location and description Kurd Mountains are part of the Limestone Massif of northwestern Syria. The mountains are a southern continuation into the Aleppo plateau of the highlands on the western part of the Aintab plateau. The valley of River Afrin surrounds Kurd Mountains from east and south and separates it from the plain of A ªzƒÅz and Mount Simeon to the east, and from Mount Harim to the south. The valley of River Aswad separates Mount Kurd from Mount Amanus to the west. In Syria, it is among the four \\"ethnic mountains\\" of western Syria, along with al-Ansariyah mountains (\\"Mountain of the Alawites\\"), Jabal Turkman (\\"Mountain of the Turkmens\\") and Jabal al-Duruz (\\"Mountain of the Druze\\"). The main town is Afrin (Efr√Æn in Kurdish), in Syria. The area is known for its olive growing and charcoal production. The majority of the Kurd-Dagh population are Hanafi-Muslims, while most Syrian Kurds are Shafiite-Muslims. Yazidis also have a presence in the region. The Sherefname (1592) asserts that the authority of Kurdish beys of the region was extended to localities in Antakya. In areas in the plains such as Islahiye, Kƒ±rƒ±khan, Reyhanlƒ±, and Kilis, there are vestiges of Kurdish concentration in Kurd-Dagh.  Demographics  As the Kurd Dagh was governed by the French, several Kurdish tribes were living in the area. From the 1800s onwards, there have settled several Kurds from the Kurd Dagh to Aleppo. While other regions populated by Kurds in Syria faced an influx of Arab immigrants and the campaign of Arabization beginning in 1960s, Kurd-Dagh was spared from Arabization, mainly due to Syria's different policy based upon good relations with pro-Damascus landowners.  Etymology  In 1977 the Kurd Dagh was renamed into the Arabic Jabal al-\`Uruba in accordance with decree 15801 which banned non-arabic place names. The Turkish part was renamed officially as Kurt Daƒüƒ± (\\"Wolf Mountain\\"), with a pun on the Turkish words K√ºrt (Kurd) and kurt (wolf). In the Syrian part during the 1980s the Kurdish names of most of this region's villages were changed to Arabic as part of the process of Arabization.

This list provides a short overview of national and international collaborations, and civilian and military programs. The USA, Russia, India, and China (2014), have succeeded at developing scramjet technologies. USA's Programs =X-15= When the second X-15 aircraft (piloted by John B. McKay) crashed on flight 74, it was damaged but survived well enough to be rebuilt. North American Aviation rebuilt it as the X-15-A2. Among other things, one of the changes was provisions for a dummy scramjet to test if wind tunnel testing was correct. Unfortunately, on the final flight of the X-15-A2 (flight 188), the shock waves sent out by the scramjet at Mach 6.7 caused extremely intense heating of over . This then drilled into the ventral fin and melted large holes. The plane survived but never flew again. Test data were limited due to the limited flights of the scramjet before the X-15-A2 and the X-15 project on the whole were cancelled. =Scram= From 1962-1978, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) undertook a classified program (declassified in 1993) to develop a family of missiles called SCRAM (Supersonic Combustion RAmjet Missile). They were intended to fit on to the Talos MK12 launcher system or the Terrier MK10 launcher. Testing of engine modules in a direct-connect, and a free-jet, facility took place at a variety of Mach numbers and pressures (altitudes). These included Mach 4 (24,000 ft), Mach 5.3 (46,000 ft), Mach 7.8 (67,000 ft) and Mach 10 (88,000 ft). Tests showed that acceptable combustion efficiency was only achieved with over 20% pentaborane (B5H9) in MCPD (C12H16). Tests with pure pentaborane (HiCal) showed that a net thrust could be achieved at Mach 7. An accelerative capability equivalent to 11g was observed for Mach 5 flight at sea level. =National Aerospace Plane= In 1986 United States president Ronald Reagan announced the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program, intended to develop two X-30 aircraft capable of single stage to orbit (SSTO), as well as horizontal takeoff and landing from conventional runways. The aircraft was to be a hydrogen fuelled air-breathing space plane, with a low speed accelerator system to bring the aircraft up to Mach 3, where the main dual-mode scramjet engines (ramjet/scramjet) would take over. At the edge of the atmosphere, a rocket was to take over and provide the final energy for orbital insertion. It was based on a classified DARPA research program called Copper Canyon. This research program suggested that Mach 25 might be possible. As the program proceeded it became clear that Mach 17 was probably the limit, whilst the weight penalty and complexity of the skin heat exchanger and other propulsion systems was going to be substantial. The program was established by the secretary of defence in 1985, and was funded to the end of FY1994, when the decision was made that the 15 billion dollars required to build the two X-30 test craft were excessive. Although the more visible parts of the program were cancelled, NASP provided a large amount of basic research, which flowed into following projects. For example, The NASP reaction model for hydrogen combustion in air (31 reactions, 16 species), is still extensively used where computational power is sufficient not to have to use reduced reaction models. =HyShot= On July 30, 2002, the University of Queensland's HyShot team (and international partners) conducted the first ever successful test flight of a scramjet. The team took a unique approach to the problem of accelerating the engine to the necessary speed by using a Terrier- Orion sounding rocket to take the aircraft up on a parabolic trajectory to an altitude of 314 km. As the craft re-entered the atmosphere, it dropped to a speed of Mach 7.6. The scramjet engine then started, and it flew at about Mach 7.6 for 6 seconds. . This was achieved on a lean budget of just A$1.5 million (US$1.1 million), a tiny fraction of NASA's US$250 million to develop the X-43A. This involved many of the same researchers involved in the University of Queensland report in 1995 of the first development of a scramjet that achieved more thrust than drag. On Saturday, March 25, 2006 researchers at the University of Queensland conducted another successful test flight of a HyShot Scramjet at the Woomera Test Range in South Australia. The Hyshot III with its ¬£1,200,000 engine made an apparently successful flight (and planned crash landing) reaching in the order of 7.6 Mach. NASA has partially explained the tremendous difference in cost between the two projects by pointing out that the American vehicle has an engine fully incorporated into an airframe with a full complement of flight control surfaces available. In the second HyShot mission, no net thrust was achieved. (The thrust was less than the drag.)Center for Hypersonics- HyShot The HyShot program currently consists of the following tests: *HyShot 1 - UQ 2-D scramjet. Failed launch due to rocket fin puncture by a rock on the landing pad. *HyShot 2 - UQ 2-D scramjet. Successful, July 30, 2002 *HyShot 3-7 - NASA tests.

The \\"purpose of this program is to investigate fundamental hypersonic phenomena and accelerate the development of aerospace vehicle technologies deemed critical to long range precision strike\\"Hypersonic International Flight Research and Experimentation by using an \\"affordable, accessible, prototype experimentation strategy\\". *HIFiRE 0 May 7, 2009 - First HIFiRE hypersonic test flight Woomera hosts first HIFiRE hypersonic test flight *HIFiRE 1 March 22, 2010 - Second HIFiRE hypersonic test flight Woomera hosts second HIFiRE hypersonic test flight *HIFiRE 2 May 1, 2012 - Accelerating velocity profile hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet HIFiRE Scramjet Research Flight Will Advance Hypersonic Technology *HIFiRE 3 Sept 13, 2012 - Radical farming axi-symmetric hydrogen-fueled scramjet HIFiRE 3 Launched from And√∏ya In 2012 the HIFiRE program was recognized with the prestigious von Karman Award by the International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences. =Hyper-X= The $250 million NASA Langley Hyper-X X-43A effort was an outgrowth of the canceled National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program on which NASA was a collaborator. Rather than developing and flying a large, expensive spaceplane with orbital capability, Hyper-X flew small test vehicles to demonstrate hydrogen-fueled scramjet engines. NASA worked with contractors Boeing, Microcraft, and the General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL) on the project. NASA's Hyper-X program is the successor to the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program which was cancelled in November 1994. This program involves flight testing through the construction of the X-43 vehicles. NASA first successfully flew its X-43A scramjet test vehicle on March 27, 2004 (an earlier test, on June 2, 2001 went out of control and had to be destroyed). Unlike the University of Queensland's vehicle, it took a horizontal trajectory. After it separated from its mother craft and booster, it briefly achieved a speed of 5,000 miles per hour (8,000 km/h), the equivalent of Mach 7, easily breaking the previous speed record for level flight of an air-breathing vehicle. Its engines ran for eleven seconds, and in that time it covered a distance of 15 miles (24 km). The Guinness Book of Records certified the X-43A's flight as the current Aircraft Speed Record holder on 30 August 2004. The third X-43 flight set a new speed record of 6,600 mph (10,620 km/h), nearly Mach 10 on 16 November 2004. It was boosted by a modified Pegasus rocket which was launched from a Boeing B-52 at 13,157 meters (43,166 ft). After a free flight where the scramjet operated for about ten seconds the craft made a planned crash into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California. The X-43A craft were designed to crash into the ocean without recovery. Duct geometry and performance of the X-43 are classified. The NASA Langley, Marshall, and Glenn Centers are now all heavily engaged in hypersonic propulsion studies. The Glenn Center is taking leadership on a Mach 4 turbine engine of interest to the USAF. As for the X-43A Hyper-X, three follow-on projects are now under consideration: Integrated Systems Test of an Air-Breathing Rocket X-43B: A scaled-up version of the X-43A, to be powered by the Integrated Systems Test of an Air- Breathing Rocket (ISTAR) engine. ISTAR will use a hydrocarbon-based liquid- rocket mode for initial boost, a ramjet mode for speeds above Mach 2.5, and a scramjet mode for speeds above Mach 5 to take it to maximum speeds of at least Mach 7. A version intended for space launch could then return to rocket mode for final boost into space. ISTAR is based on a proprietary Aerojet design called a \\"strutjet\\", which is currently undergoing wind-tunnel testing. NASA's Marshall Space Propulsion Center has introduced an Integrated Systems Test of the Air-Breathing Rocket (ISTAR) program, prompting Pratt & Whitney, Aerojet, and Rocketdyne to join forces for development. HyTECH X-43C: NASA is in discussions with the Air Force on development of a variant of the X-43A that would use the HyTECH hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet engine. The US Air Force and Pratt and Whitney have cooperated on the Hypersonic Technology (HyTECH) scramjet engine, which has now been demonstrated in a wind-tunnel environment. While most scramjet designs to date have used hydrogen fuel, HyTech runs on conventional kerosene-type hydrocarbon fuels, which are much more practical for support of operational vehicles. A full-scale engine is now being built, which will use its own fuel for cooling. Using fuel for engine cooling is nothing new, but the cooling system will also act as a chemical reactor, breaking long-chain hydrocarbons down into short-chain hydrocarbons that burn more rapidly. Hyper-X Mach 15 X-43D: A version of the X-43A with a hydrogen-powered scramjet engine with a maximum speed of Mach 15. =Fastt= On December 10, 2005, Alliant Techsystems (ATK) successfully flight-tested an air-breathing, liquid JP-10 (hydrocarbon) fuelled scramjet-powered free-flight vehicle from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia. The flight test was conducted under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)/ Office of Naval Research (ONR) Freeflight Atmospheric Scramjet Test Technique (FASTT) project. This latest flight was a culmination of a three- year, three-flight program to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of using ground-launched sounding rockets as a low-cost approach to hypersonic flight testing, and represents the world's first flight test of an air- breathing, scramjet-powered vehicle using hydrocarbon fuel. Begun in late 2002, the FASTT project entailed the design and fabrication of three flight vehicles and a ground test engine rig to undergo wind tunnel testing. The first and second payloads were dubbed surrogate payload vehicles and matched closely the scramjet flight article, but lacked the internal flowpath and fuel system. They were designed as test rounds to validate vehicle subsystems, such as booster stack combination performance, fin sets, payload deployment mechanism, telemetry and trackability, and inlet shroud, before flight testing the more complicated scramjet flowpath, which was to undergo proof-of-concept testing in a wind tunnel prior to flight testing. The first surrogate vehicle, SPV1, was launched aboard an unguided Terrier/Improved Orion two-stage solid rocket motor stack from Wallops Island on October 18, 2003, approximately 12 months after program initiation. This had the exact outer mold line of the eventual shrouded scramjet payload and contained full onboard instrumentation and telemetry suites. The vehicle was boosted to approximately and altitude, where it was deployed to free-flight, deployed its shroud at high dynamic pressure, and flew an un-powered trajectory to splashdown. All on-board subsystems worked flawlessly. The boost stage however inserted the payload at lower than desired flight speed, altitude, and flight path angle. The second surrogate vehicle, SPV2 was launched aboard the identical booster stack from Wallops Island on April 16, 2004, approximately six months after the first launch. After making slight trajectory corrections to account for launch rail effects, higher than anticipated drag, and actual booster performance, the payload was inserted nominally above and altitude. The full complement of subsystems were again proven out in flight on this successful flight test. The results of these two flight tests are summarized in a technical paper AIAA-2005-3297, presented at the 13th International Space Planes and Hypersonics Systems and Technologies Conference (see )in Capua, Italy. The ground test engine hardware was fabricated over 18 months and underwent a four-month engine validation testing program in the ATK GASL freejet wind tunnel complex Leg 6, located in Ronkonkoma, New York. Ignition, fuel throttling, and engine operation were wrung out over a range of expected flight conditions. After a delay of two months to modify flight hardware based on ground test findings, the first powered vehicle, FFV1, was launched without incident, propelled to speeds of at altitude, roughly Mach 5.5. Over 140 inlet, combustor, and vehicle outer mold line pressure, temperatures, and vehicle accelerations as well as fuel pressure, timing feedback, and power systems monitoring were recorded. The vehicle executed the prescribed test sequences flawlessly for 15 seconds, before continuing on to splashdown into the Atlantic Ocean. Further details can be found in the technical paper AIAA-2006-8119, presented at the 14th International Space Planes and Hypersonics Systems and Technologies Conference, in Canberra, Australia. Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) GASL Division led the contractor team for the FASTT project, developed and integrated the scramjet vehicle, and acted as mission managers for the three flights. Launch vehicle integration and processing was performed by Rocket Support Services (formerly DTI Associates), Glen Burnie, MD; the flight shroud was developed by Systima Technologies, Inc., Bothell, Washington; electrical systems, telemetry and instrumentation was handled by the NASA Sounding Rocket Office Contract (NSROC); flight test support was provided by the NASA Wallops Flight Facility; and technical support was provided by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Baltimore, MD. GASL previously built and integrated the engine flowpaths and fuel systems for the three X-43A flight vehicles, working closely with air framer and systems integrator Boeing, NASA Langley, and NASA Dryden on the successful Hyper-X Program. =Promethee= Several scramjet designs are now under investigation with Russian assistance. One of these options or a combination of them will be selected by ONERA, the French aerospace research agency, with the EADS conglomerate providing technical backup. The notional immediate goal of the study is to produce a hypersonic air-to-surface missile named \\"Promethee\\", which would be about 6 meters (20 ft) long and weigh 1,700 kilograms (3,750 lb). =GASL projectile= At a test facility at Arnold Air Force Base in the U.S. state of Tennessee, the General Applied Science Laboratory (GASL) fired a projectile equipped with a hydrocarbon-powered scramjet engine from a large gun. On July 26, 2001, the four inch (100 mm) wide projectile covered a distance of 260 feet (79 m) in 30 milliseconds (roughly 5,900 mph or 9,500 km/h).Hypersonic Scramjet Projectile Flys In Missile Test. SpaceDaily.com http://www.spacedaily.com/news/scramjet-01a.html The projectile is supposedly a model for a missile design. Many do not consider this to be a scramjet \\"flight,\\" as the test took place near ground level. However, the test environment was described as being very realistic. =Falcon (darpa)= The final target of the FALCON program is a hypersonic vehicle that will be using scramjet technology. =HyV (\\"High-Five\\")= Hy-V is a scramjet experiment to obtain and compare ground test and flight test supersonic combustion data. The general goal of the project is to validate wind tunnel test results that will eventually be used to develop computational codes. The primary investigators are the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Alliant Techsystems, and the test will be launched on a Terrier- Orion sounding rocket from NASA's Wallops Island site.The HyV Program. . Accessed 15 Oct 2009. =Boeing X-51= The Boeing X-51 is a scramjet demonstration aircraft for hypersonic (Mach 7, around 8,050 km/h) flight testing. The X-51 WaveRider program is a consortium of the US Air Force, DARPA, NASA, Boeing and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. The program is managed by the Propulsion Directorate within the United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The X-51 is a descendant of earlier efforts including the Advanced Rapid Response Missile Demonstrator and the liquid hydrocarbon- fuelled scramjet engine developed under the USAF's HyTech program. The first free-flight of the X-51 took place in May 2010. On 1 May 2013, the X-51 performed its first fully successful flight test, flying for 240 seconds until running out of fuel; this test was the longest air-breathing hypersonic flight. This test signified the completion of the program.\\"Hypersonic X-51 programme ends in success\\". Flight International, 3 May 2013.\\"X-51A Waverider Achieves Hypersonic Goal On Final Flight\\". Aviation Week, 2 May 2013.  Other programs  = Brazil = The 14-X is a Brazilian hypersonic aircraft, named in tribute to the 14-bis of Alberto Santos-Dumont. This aircraft is equipped with a scramjet engine, which is integrated into the fuselage and has no moving parts. The operating principle is that, during flight, the air is compressed by the geometry and speed of the vehicle and directed to the engine at the bottom of the aircraft. Hydrogen is used as the fuel. The vehicle will utilize the ‚ÄúWaverider‚Äù concept. = China = On 9 January 2014 US surveillance satellites observed an object flying at a speed of between Mach 5 and Mach 10 with an altitude of around 100 kilometers. Following Chinese statements the preliminary Pentagon designation for this object is WU-14. In the first phase this unmanned vehicle was brought to its operating height and speed by a military long-range missile. In August 2015, it was reported that a Chinese researcher had been awarded for the successful development and test flight of a new scramjet engine, the first of its kind in China.http://www.popsci.com/chinese-hypersonic-engine-wins-award-reshapes- speed-race This would make China the third country in the world, after Russia and the United States, to have successfully test flown a scramjet. A new near- hypersonic drone, with a variable-cycle turbo-ramjet engine, has also been flown. It is reportedly the fastest air-breathing recoverable vehicle in the world.http://www.popsci.com/chinese-hypersonic-engine-wins-award-reshapes- speed-race It was later revealed that the first flight of a Waverider-like scramjet-powered vehicle occurred in 2011, with flight tests completed by 2014.http://news.ifeng.com/a/20160715/49359552_0.shtmlhttp://m.gmw.cn/xz/201607/13/20949891.html = Germany = The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft has founded Research Training Group 1095 . Research purposes are the aero-thermodynamic design and development of a scramjet demonstrator. There is no official name for the demonstrator yet. The project includes basic research to gain a better understanding of supersonic fuel mixing and combustion, aerodynamic effects, material sciences and issues in system design. The project involves the University of Stuttgart, Technical University of Munich, RWTH Aachen and the German Aerospace Center. = India = * The Thiruvananthapuram-based Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) designed and ground-tested a scramjet in 2005. A press release stated that stable supersonic combustion was demonstrated in ground testing for nearly seven seconds with an inlet Mach number of six. * In 2010, a flight test of Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV-D01) with a passive scramjet engine combustor module was conducted. It was a suborbital ballistic trajectory based experiment using a two-stage RH-560 sounding rocket. * The HSTDV is a technology demonstrator under development by the DRDO. It has been ground- tested at hypersonic speeds for 20 seconds. * On August 28, 2016, ISRO successfully flight tested the Scramjet engine in Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV-D02). It is the second scramjet flight test of VSSC-ISRO. https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/rare-opportunity-where- eminent-scientists-from-isro-shared-every-aspect-of-space- flight-5566527/https://alumni.iitm.ac.in/daa/list.php?yr=2018. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993abe..conf..138C * On June 12, 2019, India conducted the maiden flight test of its indigenously developed unmanned scramjet demonstration aircraft for hypersonic speed flight from a base from Abdul Kalam Island in the Bay of Bengal at about 11.25 am. The aircraft is called the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle. The trial was carried out by the Defence Research and Development Organisation. The aircraft forms an important component of the country's programme for development of a Hypersonic Cruise missile system. * ISRO is also planning to perform a (SPEX) Scramjet Propulsion Experiment for their RLV-TD programme which is focused on reusability of launch vehicle. ISRO has already performed maiden testing of the vehicle on 23 May 2016. = Russia = The first working scramjet in the world \\"GLL Kholod\\" flew on 28 November 1991, reaching a speed of Mach 5.8.http://www.testpilot.ru/russia/tsiam/holod/holod.htmhttp://www.ciam.ru/?SId=294‚ü®=RUS However, the collapse of the Soviet Union stopped the funding of the project. After NASA's NASP program was cut, American scientists began to look at adopting available Russian technology as a less expensive alternative to developing hypersonic flight. On November 17, 1992, Russian scientists with some additional French support successfully launched a scramjet engine named \\"Kholod\\" in Kazakhstan. From 1994 to 1998 NASA worked with the Russian Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) to test a dual-mode scramjet engine and transfer technology and experience to the West. Four tests took place, reaching Mach numbers of 5.5, 5.35, 5.8, and 6.5. The final test took place aboard a modified SA-5 surface-to-air missile launched from the Sary Shagan test range in the Republic of Kazakhstan on 12 February 1998. According to CIAM telemetry data, the first ignition attempt of the scramjet was unsuccessful, but after 10 seconds the engine was started and the experimental system flew 77s with good performance, up until the planned SA-5 missile self- destruction (according to NASA, no net thrust was achieved). Some sources in the Russian military have said that a hypersonic (Mach 10 to Mach 15) maneuverable ICBM warhead was tested. The new \\"GLL Igla\\" system was expected to fly in 2009. The 3M22 Zircon is a scramjet powered maneuvering anti-ship hypersonic cruise missile developed by Russia.

In October 2008, it was declared extinct by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in its Red List since the species had not been seen since 1987, despite years of extensive searches. However, the species was rediscovered in 2010 by a Costa Rican herpetologist and is now classified as critically endangered. It is believed that the species is most threatened by the presence of the chytrid fungus in its habitat.Incilius holdridgei. AmphibiaWeb (4 October 2011). Retrieved on 2013-01-01. Description =Taxonomy= Originally found on Barva Volcano in Cordillera Central, Costa Rica, the Holdridge's toad is still endemic to that particular small area of Costa Rica's rainforests. It is named after the research scientist Holdridge for its discovery. It can be distinguished in classification from other toads by its morphological differences. For example, Incilius holdridgei differs from Incilius fastidiosus because of the different cranial crests and from Incilius peripetates due to the different sizes at the adult age. =Morphology= The adult male is between 32 and 46 mm snout vent length (SVL). The adult female is slightly larger, measuring between 38 and 53 mm SVL. Both the male and female have similar dorsum coloration ranging from black to light brown with a lighter colored venter. The limbs, as well as the dorsal and lateral surfaces are spotted with reddish warts of varying sizes. The head is broad with low crests, excluding the thicker supratympanic crest. The reddish colored parotoid gland is smooth and globular. Limbs are shortened and feature fleshy hands and feet that are moderately webbed and lack tubercles. Both males and females of the species lack structures of the ear, causing deafness. Males lack vocal slits and sac, and have unusually hypertrophied testes. Holdridge's Toad. Encyclopedia of Life. Retrieved on 2014-10-19. Incilius holdridgei tadpoles are small in size with ovoid-shaped bodies that are dark brown in color and feature a lighter venter surface. The tail and caudal fins are rounded. The mouth is directed ventrally and the oral disc has beaks and 2 to 3 rows of denticles which are bordered by a row of large papillae. =Behavior= Incilius holdridgei are fossorial, and remain relatively inactive while burrowed underground. During seasons of heavy rain, they can be found underneath layers of forest floor debris. During dryer periods, they can be found near stream banks. Members of the species become more active during the daytime when they are above ground or crepuscular time. Due to their morphology, Incilius holdridgei are deaf and mute; they apparently do not communicate through sound or have mating calls- a rarity among frogs and toads. Before 1986, the species had been relatively easy to spot during its two-month mating season from April to May when males and females became more active and gathered in the hundreds. However, outside of the mating season, the toads were very difficult to locate.Costa Rica's Holdridge Toad Declared Extinct. ECO PRESERVATION SOCIETY (16 October 2008). Retrieved on 2014-10-15. Archived (with image visible) Since 1987, the species has declined in numbers and currently exists in a critically endangered state. Since it was re-discovered in 2010, just few individuals have seen again, for that reason this species is one of the most threatened in the world. =Habitat= Holdridge's toads have been mainly observed in the rainforests of the Central Mountain Range of Costa Rica. The species has recently been found living in open grassy areas. The Holdridge's Toad is a species that exists in montane rainforest of Costa Rica. This class of toads settles below the surfaces‚Äô rubbish inside the forest during the duration of excessive rainfall. They are classified as a fossorial species due to the act of digging or burrowing themselves. When they are not avoiding the heavy rainfall, they favor massy stream banks. The forest, wetlands, and/or pasturelands are sufficient enough for the Holdridge's Toad. =Diet= Due to the fact that the Holdridge's toad is reappearing from assumed extinction, research is beginning on this small organism. Revival of past research gives current research scientists direction of what to discover and learn from this toad. From collected past and new research along, as the Holdridge's is exposed to Costa Rica's rainforests‚Äô bacteria and fungus, the diet can be inferred. The Holdridge's toads' diet includes a broad range of arthropod invertebrates, among them spiders, larval stages of moths and butterflies (lepidopterans), flies, beetles, earwigs (dermoptera), ants, and mites (Savage 2002). =Reproduction= The average age for sexual maturity of Incilius holdridgei is probably about two years. Due to the lack of development of vocal slits and tympana Incilius holdridgei do not have a breeding call. This species is an explosive breeder that lays clutches of large eggs in pools of water on the forest floor, they are also known to lay eggs in man-made drainage ditches. Historically however, Incilius holdridgei were known to breed in more open areas such as pastures, but due to habitat conservation efforts these pastures are now evolving back into forests. The males are known to arrive to these breeding pools following periods of heavy rain around early to mid-April and wait for the arrival of the females. At one time there were so many of them that some of the toads would try to mate with other species during these mating frenzies. It is also believed that the females only stay at the breeding pool for about only an hour or so. In reference to the reproduction of the Holdridge's toad, it was expressed as an ‚Äúexplosive breeder‚ÄùHumans, pets and fungi the latest species killers.

Due to the toad not being observed for over twenty years, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature declared the species extinct. Between 1968 and 2009 there were no sightings of Holdridge's toad in their natural environment. Extensive searches were led to determine if the species was extinct. The searches lasted for seven years before the toad was declared extinct. Multiple causes are believed to have led to the toad's presumed extinction, including chytridiomycosis, climate change, and deforestation. Incilius holdridgei . Retrieved 2014-10-23 The main threat to Holdridge's toad is thought to be chytridiomycosis, a fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, that causes an infections disease in amphibians. The fungus keratinizes any keratin-containing skin layers in both the tadpoles and adult frogs.An Overview of Chytridiomycosis. Retrieved 2014-10-23 High levels of this fungus were detected in the breeding grounds of Holdridge's toad before and after the species appeared to vanish. In 2009, tadpole and adult toads were discovered in two separate ponds that reclassified the species as critically endangered. From 2008 to 2010, there was extensive searching efforts for the species. The search suggested that the adult population is less than 50 mature individuals, leading to its listing as Critically Endangered.NatureServe & IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2012. Incilius holdridgei. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.2. .

Of the forty recorded visits, Holdridge's toad has been observed on twenty-two occasions, accounting for sixty-seven organisms.FrogLog - Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project. Retrieved on 2014-10-15 Much of the known range of this species is protected in Parque Nacional Braulio Carrillo, 20 km north-east of the capital of San Jos√©. The two sites where the species is known to persist in 2010 are located in the Cerro Dantos and Jaguarundi Refuges, neither of which has the same protection status as a national park. Even with the lower protection status, the forest cover of these refuges remains intact and seemingly not threatened. Although one might think that the population of Incilius holdridgei is recovering, information on the only known populations is still very limited; there needs to be more research on the population dynamics, environmental factors of the breeding sites, population health and genetics. A monitoring project is being carried out under the auspices of the Foundation Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund. It is believed that the major cause of the toad's decrease in population is chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease that affects amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus. The increase of the chytrid fungus has been connected to global warming.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 3,759. Geography Moyock is located on North Carolina Highway 168 just south of the Virginia state line. The community sits at the end of the Chesapeake Expressway toll road, and is only south of downtown Norfolk, Virginia. Because of this, Moyock has begun to witness an increase in residential development as an emerging commuter town for the Hampton Roads region. NC 168 leads southeast to Currituck, the county seat. =Driving distances= Areas north of the N.C. state line are a short to medium distance away. Moyock is the closest of all North Carolina locales to the following places: *The Delmarva Peninsula at Fisherman Island before the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel toll booth is to the north. *The Mason‚ÄìDixon line at Selbyville, Delaware, is to the north. *The New Jersey state line where crossed by the Cape May-Lewes Ferry in the middle of Delaware Bay is to the north ( into the bay after leaving Lewes, Delaware). This is the closest distance that North Carolina is to the Northeastern United States.  Greyhound racing in Moyock  Local greyhound racing was originally in Norfolk County in the 1930s, until Virginia officials shut down the Cavalier Kennel Club (CKC). The CKC moved their operations a half mile south of the state line to a quarter-mile oval track in Moyock on North Carolina Highway 168. Prior to when they moved to Moyock, the CKC attracted gamblers and spectators from all over the Hampton Roads region from the late 1940s until the early 1950s. The track's primary market was the thousands of service men (mostly U.S. Navy personnel) that were stationed in Norfolk. Not long after its establishment in North Carolina, anti-gambling advocates and the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the North Carolina State Legislature's anti-dog-racing law in 1954. It was until 2009 that the CKC was able to claim that Paul Hartwell invented the greyhound letter rating system, which stood as the standard for all greyhound racing, which also led to the Composite Speed Rating system.  NASCAR in Moyock  After the Cavalier Kennel Club (CKC) was eliminated by the North Carolina General Assembly in the 1950s, Moyock began to host auto racing at the renamed Dog Track Speedway (DTS). Built on the former site of the CKC, the one- quarter-mile oval dirt track was then paved and lengthened to one-third of a mile in 1964. At the DTS, it hosted seven NASCAR races from 1962 until 1966. The Moyock 300 was held there from 1964‚Äì1965 in addition to the Tidewater 300 in 1965. Ned Jarrett won the most races at the track with two wins in 1962 and 1964. Jarret's Ford raced and won all six times, totaling $4,631 in winnings. Richard Petty, a North Carolina native from Randleman, also raced there six times, driving a Plymouth in every race. Despite being on the pole twice (1965 & 1966), Petty never finished above 3rd place. His total winnings at the DTS were $1,700. The final NASCAR race at the DTS ran on Sunday, May 29, 1966. It was 301 laps (99.9 miles), and David Pearson took the checkered flag in a 1964 Dodge with an average speed of and winning $1,000. The track was closed later in 1966 due to declining attendance, poor revenues and larger tracks being built nearby. International business Moyock was the corporate headquarters of Blackwater Worldwide, which was renamed Xe Services LLC, and relocated to Arlington County, Virginia, as Academi.

Tom Trana (29 November 1937, in Kristinehamn, Sweden - May 17, 1991), was a famous motor rally driver. This V√§rmland sportsman was Volvo's counterpart to Saab's Erik Carlsson (\\"Carlsson p√• taket\\" - \\"Carlsson on the roof\\"). It has been said that he had to drive the rear-wheel drive Volvo more enthusiastically than Carlsson, with the front-wheel drive Saab.  Career  Originally a Volvo mechanic, Trana showed strong driving performances with his own Volvo P1800 and with a British BMC vehicle. He came to the attention of the Volvo works team and its leader, Gunnar Andersson, himself twice European Rally Championship, as early as 1962. For 1963, he was given a works drive and won the British RAC Rally in the same season. Volvo won the European Rally Championship in 1963 with a special 122S. Also in 1963 a 122S driven by Tom Trana finished a very close second to Jaguar in the European Touring Car Championship. A year later, Trana was again the overall RAC Rally winner. He achieved further wins in the 1964 Acropolis Rally in Greece and in his home event, the Swedish Rally in 1965. These achievements earned him a definitive place in the top league of motor sport and the nickname the \\"Horseman of the Apocalypse\\". Soon thereafter, the Swede was in collision with a transporter and his co-driver Gunnar Thermaenius died. Trana was cleared of any guilt, in the subsequent legal proceedings. Nevertheless, he changed from daredevil to careful driver, who could still be very fast but without the conquering carefreeness that is linked to success. In addition, Volvo withdrew its works team for more than ten years, following a further fatal accident on the 1966 Akropolis Rally, in which two mechanics died. It continued to provide generous support for private entrants, however. Tom Trana changed to Saab for 1967, which resulted in relative success, including a win in the 1967 Norwegian Rally. He also took the Swedish Championship, in 1968. He rallied with Saab until 1972, when he finally hung up his helmet and retired from rallying.  Postscript  Tom Trana died on 17 May 1991. Volvo only officially returned to motor sport at the end of the 1970s, sending the Volvo R-Team (R stood for Rallycross, Rallying and Racing) to the FIA Rallycross European Championships of the years 1978 to 1980. Driven by Per-Inge Walfridsson, the legitimate successor to Tom Trana as a representative of the Swedish car maker, Volvo succeeded in 1980 (with a 343 Turbo) against the Norwegian Martin Schanche (Ford Escort RS 1800) and won the Rallycross EC title.

He was the lead singer and guitarist for Six By Seven and also the band's main creative influence. He studied art at Wakefield College (1990‚Äì91) and gained a BA (Hons) in photography at Nottingham Trent University (1991‚Äì94). It was at his time at University that Olley met Sam Hempton and together they formed six.byseven. Olley and Chris Davis were the only constant members in the different line-ups of Six By Seven over the years. Although born in England, Olley spent much of his early years in Germany, a fact alluded to on Six By Seven's first single \\"European Me\\". Consequently, some Six By Seven releases have featured tracks sung entirely in German, most notably the B-Side \\"Helden\\", a cover of David Bowie's song \\"Heroes\\". Olley also released music as part of his Twelve project during his time with six.byseven and after. In 2006 and 2008, Olley toured with Julian Cope as merchandise man and roadie. Chris Olley at this time also recorded much of the album 'You Got A problem With Me' and is also credited with playing synthesizer on the album. Olley also recorded the album 'The Black Sheep' as well as contributing backing vocals and guitar. During this time Olley also edited and mastered Brain Donor as well as co writing and recording and providing German translations for the album \\"Vernichte Die Gotter\\" by a fictional Dutch duo named Kabalist. Olley appeared under the name Hugo De Klay and Julian Cope played synth and did vocals under his alias Ron Boots. Olley also played Wurlitzer and Hammond organ in Julian Copes band at the ATP show in Minehead 2007. In 2006, Cope's Jehovahkill album was re-released as a deluxe edition with an extra CD. Olley is acknowledged for the editing and tape transfer of disc 2 (in his own SNSM studios). 2009 saw the release of a debut solo album entitled A Streetcar Named Disaster and several other EP's including \\"East Of Edale\\" and \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wade\\" and \\"The Grapes of Hyman Roth\\" through his website and Cargo Records. In late 2007 Olley returned to his photography once more and undertook a project to photograph every football stadium in the first 4 leagues on a 250cc motorbike. The trip ended at the end of the summer of 2010 with an exhibition of all 92 images in Derby Museum's Salt Mill Gallery. More recently his 92 Stadiums project was shown in Gda≈Ñsk during the European Championships in Poland.

The film was screened at the International Critics' Week section of the Cannes Film Festival in 1987 and received the FIPRESCI prize at the 35th International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. Plot The film is set in a town after a nuclear war, the town is destroyed and polluted with radioactive elements, with multiple dead bodies lying in the streets. A police curfew is established in the immediate vicinity and only healthy people are allowed admittance to the underground bunkers. The main character, Professor Larsen, played by Rolan Bykov, is a Nobel Prize in Physics laureate, who lives in the basement of a museum along with his sick wife and several other people who used to work at the museum. He often writes letters to his son Eric, though he has no way of contacting him. Larsen believes the war has ended and that more surviving humans exist outside the central bunker, but nobody else believes his theories and instead think that humanity is doomed. Larsen visits an orphanage where the current caretaker of the surviving children explains that she's thinking of evacuating to the central bunker, though may have to leave the children behind as they likely won't be allowed in since they're sick, to Larsen's disapproval. Larsen is informed that he also might be rejected from entering the central bunker due to his old age. With his wife's health declining, Larsen sneaks past several soldiers during curfew hours and attempts to find medicine for his wife, escaping from a military raid in the process. When he returns to the museum's basement, however, he finds that his wife died. The other museum employees bury her body. In one of his letters to Eric, Larsen tells a darkly humorous story on how someone failed to prevent the nuclear war. According to him, an operator from an electronics center had a chance to cancel the first missile launch (which happened due to a computer error), but was unable to reach the computer in time to abort the launch as he was slowed down by a cup of coffee in his hands. The operator then hung himself in return. Larsen makes a trip to the central bunker in an effort to find Eric. After sneaking into a medical facility, he enters the children's department, only to find all the children sick, injured, and screaming in agony, much to Larsen's horror (it's assumed he didn't find Eric amongst them). After returning to the museum basement, he finds that a museum employee is about to take his life as he thinks the history of mankind has ended and that mankind was doomed from the very beginning. He then leaves the group, lies down in a grave, and shoots himself dead, much to the horror of his son. Later, while salvaging books from a flooded library, Larsen talks with a man who disagrees with his theory on how there's hope for mankind, referencing how Jesus said mankind was doomed. Larsen visits the orphanage again where he learns the children were rejected from entering the central bunker. The caretaker leaves the children for Larsen to look after, for she is evacuating to the central bunker herself. The remaining museum employees also evacuate to the central bunker, though Larsen stays behind to look after the children (it's assumed they're the only people left in the town). On Christmas Day, Larsen creates a makeshift Christmas tree out of sticks and candles while the children design Christmas ornaments to decorate it with. In his final letter to Eric, Larsen writes that he finally found purpose in life and that he hopes his son doesn't leave him alone in the world. The final scenes are narrated by one of the children Larsen looked after, who explains that he died some time later. On his deathbed, he told the children to leave the museum and find somewhere else to go while they have the strength, still believing that life exists elsewhere. The film ends with the children wandering through the apocalyptic landscape together, their fates unknown. Deadmans-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000 Cast * Rolan Bykov - Professor Larsen * Vatslav Dvorzhetsky - Pastor * Vera Mayorova - Anna * Vadim Lobanov * Viktor Mikhaylov * Svetlana Smirnova (actress) - Theresa * Vladimir Bessekernyh * Vyacheslav Vasiliev - doctor dosimetrist * Natalya Vlasova Themes Due to the heated climate between North America and Russia during the events of The Cold War, many critics believe that Dead Man‚Äôs Letters is a response to American films like War Games and The Day After discussing their perspective on the Nuclear Arms Race. TBS (American TV channel) purchased the rights to show Dead Man‚Äôs Letters, deciding to air it alongside Amerika (TV miniseries), a twelve-hour ABC miniseries about what the United States would be like as a Soviet satellite state. The heavy reliance on themes like warfare, uncertainty, and grief as well as Americans involved in the war are interwoven through the production design from Yelena Amshinskaya and Viktor Ivanov. The use of defense equipment in the film, including gas masks and shelter equipment, makes its portrayal of a post-nuclear setting an eerie mirror image of the Soviet program Production Around the time the film started production, it was common knowledge that Russia had a strict censorship policy following the death of Stalin, resulting in a three year waiting period for Lopushansky and the crew consisting of various re-rewrites, possibly most likely due to Vyacheslav Rybakov's involvement with anti-Soviet literature and run-ins with the KGB. However, censorship started to loosen around the mid to late 80s towards discussing sensitive topics regarding current or previous events in Russia's history, which caused producers and film studios to become a lot more lenient with what was shown in cinemas. Gorbachev established a policy of allowing more open discussion of previously sensitive political issues making it possible for well connected civil defense skeptics to popularize their views. The patronage of Anatolii Gromyko- historian, member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and son of Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko enabled the production by Lenfilm in 1986 of the first portrayal of the aftermath of nuclear war in Soviet cinema. Before production started on this film and his short Solo, Lopunshansky served as an apprentice for Tarkovsky and would later work as a production assistant for his film Stalker. Tarkovsky's teachings played a huge influence on Lopushansky's directing style as well as many aspects of the film from the set design, cinematography, and signature slow yet otherworldly pacing. In a 2017 interview with Indie Cinema, Lopunshansky states \\"I noticed that his lectures, in fact, are not about certain professional skills, but are more philosophical, about understanding the essence of art, its essence.\\" This can be seen through the films brutal realism and constant feelings of hopelessness and confusion, a sentiment shared with by various members of the crew. The use of monochrome coloring on the film stock gives a resemblance to the greenish tint seen in various scenes in Stalker, in order to give the film a more foreboding atmosphere. Reception In 1989, the New York Times published a somewhat positive review of the film. Praising the film for its brutal realism and stunning set design, but found that the film was somewhat dismissed by its meandering in certain scenes stating \\"despite its technical virtues, seems just a bit too contrived to truly convince, much less to deeply move. Yet, in stripping the ideological gloss from the vision of ultimate calamity, Mr. Lopushinsky does succeed in creating a cultural artifact that makes the specter of the most dreadful possible event common to both sides of the superpower divide‚Äù.

History  Faronics was founded in 1993 by Farid Ali, the company's present CEO, and was incorporated in 1996. Faronics first sold computer hardware and shifted to software in 1999 with the advent of Deep Freeze, a kernel-level software utility that instantly restores a computer back to its original configuration with every reboot. Deep Freeze has since-garnered a strong presence in K-12 education and is now part of Faronics \\"Layered Security\\" suite of products.  Products  Faronics develops nine software products which run on Windows and Mac OS X operating systems: = Deep Freeze = A software utility, released in 1999, that restores a computer back to its original configuration each time the computer restarts. Deep Freeze comes in two versions for Windows (Standard for standalone computers and Enterprise for networked computers) and a version for Mac OS X (a version for SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED) by Novell was discontinued in 2010). Deep Freeze for Windows can be managed remotely via its Enterprise Console or via Faronics Core. Deep Freeze Mac can be centrally-managed in multiple computer settings via Apple Remote Desktop.  The principle of operation  Deep Freeze is a kernel-level driver that runs at a low system level to protect drive integrity. Running at this low system level allows the driver to redirect information which is being written to the drive, leaving the original data intact. This redirected information is no longer referenced once the computer is restarted, thus restoring the system to its original state at the disk sector level. To the computer user, the computing experience is unaffected when Deep Freeze is active. For Deep Freeze to protect a computer's configuration, a computer must have its BIOS password-protected and have its hard disk as the first boot device. = Anti-Executable = Originally released in 2005 as FreezeX, Anti-Executable is an application whitelisting software that, when first installed, creates a \\"whitelist\\" of executable files which exists on a computer. When Anti-Executable is active, unwanted executables which do not appear on the whitelist will not run. Anti-Executable comes in two versions for Windows (Standard for standalone computers and Enterprise for networked computers). Anti-Executable Enterprise can be managed remotely via Faronics Core. = Faronics Anti-Virus = Released in 2010, this anti-virus software for Windows combines anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti- rootkit technologies. Faronics Anti-Virus works with Deep Freeze so that program updates can be performed without turning Deep Freeze protection off. Faronics Anti-Virus is managed remotely via Faronics Core. = Power Save = Released in 2007, Power Save provides PC power management to aid in green computing initiatives and to help reduce power expenses. Power Save monitors computer activity to avoid interfering with computers in use and produces reports which show power consumption savings. Power Save comes in versions for Windows and Mac OS X. Power Save for Windows can be managed remotely via Faronics Core. Power Save Mac can be monitored remotely via Faronics Core and centrally-managed via Apple Remote Desktop. = WINSelect = Released in 1997, WINSelect is a user environment management software that allows IT administrators to customize the operating system and application functionality of computers in public access, kiosk, library, educational, and corporate environments. WINSelect comes in two versions for Windows (Standard for standalone computers and Enterprise for networked computers).

Career Life Without Buildings formed during the summer of 1999. The band consisted mostly of ex-students of the Glasgow School of Art, Initial band members were Will Bradley (drums), Chris Evans (bass) and Robert Johnston (guitar). Painter Sue Tompkins (vocals) joined later in 1999. The band split writing duties, with Johnston, Bradley and Evans writing the music while Tompkins wrote the vocals. Tompkins' \\"talk-sung\\" vocal styling eventually became the band's most famous attribute. Impressed after their first London gig, the Rough Trade-affiliated Tugboat label asked the band to record a debut single. Released in March 2000, \\"The Leanover\\" b/w \\"New Town\\" secured the band a full deal with the label. \\"New Town\\" received some airplay on BBC Radio 1. The band later released two more singles on the Tugboat label. The band's debut, Any Other City, recorded by Scottish producer Andy Miller at Chem19 Studios in Glasgow, was released in 2001 in the UK; label DCBaltimore2012 issued it months later in the United States. Life Without Buildings were on the same bill as The Strokes in February 2001, during the latter band's first headlining gig. A popular legend sprung up that due to the Strokes' popularity, Life Without Buildings was bumped further down the bill. Band members disputed this, saying that while they had been scheduled to play the show, it was the result of a booking error, not anything intentional. In January 2002 Any Other City debuted at #49 on the CMJ Radio 200. It stayed on the Radio 200 for eight weeks, peaking at #22. =Break-up= The band broke up in 2002, after the release of Any Other City. In a 2009 interview with Muso's Guide, guitarist Johnston stated the band broke up because Tompkins wanted to focus on her career as a visual artist. He went on to stress that none of the band members ever envisioned turning music into a career, and they felt pressure because something that had started \\"for a laugh\\" had become serious. In May 2007 a live album was released in Europe called Live at the Annandale Hotel on the Gargleblast Records label. The album was subsequently released in North America on Absolutely Kosher Records in August 2007. Band members claimed to be unaware that the Annandale Hotel show was recorded, but were happy with the finished live record. Any Other City was reissued on vinyl in the United States for the first time on April 19, 2014 for Record Store Day. The vinyl reissue included a 7\\", featuring rougher original versions of \\"The Leanover\\" and \\"New Town\\". As of 2009, the band has stated no desire to either re-form or play one-off shows.

Etymology The specific name peripatetes is Greek for \\"one who walks\\" and alludes to Charles F. Walker, a student of herpetology at the University of Michigan. Description Incilius peripatetes is a medium-sized toad, with the holotype, an adult male, reported to be in snout‚Äìvent length. Dorsal coloration is uniformly light brown or grey. The dorsum is rugose, without enlarged warts. The cranial crests are very prominent, whereas the paratoid glands are slightly small, smaller than the eye. The ventral surface is light brown. The rear surfaces of the thighs and the groin are dark brown or black, with some light spots in the groin. The hands and feet have fleshy webbing between the fingers and toes. There is no vocal sack in the males. Habitat and conservation This is a little known terrestrial toad inhabiting premontane wet forest at elevation of asl.

The population as of the 2010 census was 4,574. Carrollton is located near the southern end of the James River Bridge across from Newport News. Carrollton has recently experienced growth as a bedroom community. History Carrollton is named for the Carroll family, prominent landowners of the 19th century. The remaining home of the Carroll family is located at the intersection of Reynolds Drive and Norsworthy Drive, and is considered to have been in deteriorating condition for many years. At one time the home also is said to have served as the Carrollton Country Store. The Carroll home is one of only a handful of truly historic Carrollton homes. It predates the original Carrollton Post Office, which is now occupied by a locally owned heating business. The old post office is located about east of the Carroll home on Norsworthy Drive near the western end of the current CDP. Its flagpole still stands. Geography The Carrollton CDP is in the eastern portion of Isle Wight County, occupying a swath of land west of the James River and southeast of Smithfield. It includes the unincorporated community of Bartlett. The southern border of the CDP is tidal Chuckatuck Creek, forming the border between Isle of Wight County and the independent city of Suffolk. The eastern border of the CDP follows Winall Creek north from Chuckatuck Creek, then Newbill Lane and State Route 661, then extends east to tidal Ragged Island Creek. The border runs north up the creek to U.S. Route 17, then follows State Routes 659 and 712 (Vellines Lane) west to State Route 665 (Smiths Neck Road). The border continues southwest on Route 665, which becomes Reynolds Drive, running to an unnamed creek near Woolard Lane. The border follows the creek south to U.S. Route 258, which it follows east back to US-17 at Bartlett, then turns south on US-17 to Deep Bottom Drive. The border then runs south to Creer Creek, continuing south (downstream) to Brewers Creek, which it follows southeast back to Chuckatuck Creek. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Carrollton CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.48%, are water. The Carrollton ZIP code area extends outside the CDP east as far as the James River and the border with Newport News, southeast to the border with the city of Suffolk, west to the area of Benns Church, and northwest to Jones Creek near Smithfield. The Carrollton post office lies about one mile southeast of the intersection of Carrollton Boulevard and Brewer's Neck Boulevard (U.S. Routes 17 and 258 and State Route 32), along Carrollton Boulevard (US-17). Carrollton does not include the communities of Battery Park or Rescue. Carrollton has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and average monthly temperatures range from 40.4¬∞ F in January to 80.0¬∞ F in July. The local hardiness zone is 8a. Current growth Carrollton has seen significant growth in the last decade, including a shopping center, several fast food establishments, medical and veterinary medical centers, regional banks, a farm supply store, a fitness center, a car wash, and a hotel. Several residential communities have been developed since 2001, with homes having starting prices above $250,000 and some as high as $900,000. Condominiums adjoin these communities, as well as luxury apartments. Some of these are not newly approved, as the Eagle Harbor subdivision was originally approved in the 1970s by the county's Board of Supervisors, though development plans lay dormant until around 2000. The Carrollton Fire Department has undergone extensive expansion, adding bays and being the only fire department in the county to also offer EMS service with two new Freightliner ambulances. Carrollton is one of the two largest voting districts in Isle of Wight County, the other being Smithfield. The Route 17 James River Bridge carries in excess of 30,000 vehicles per day through Carrollton, many of which carry commuters to and from Newport News Shipbuilding.

The station buildings at platform level are a little unusual compared with other stations on the line in that they are constructed entirely of timber. Nearby is RAF Cosford which is also home to a branch of the Royal Air Force Museum. The station is served by West Midlands Trains, who manage the station, and Transport for Wales. Between 2008 and 2011 it was also served by the direct London operator, Wrexham & Shropshire. History The pre-2012 station with wooden platforms. The aerodrome can be seen in the background. The line between Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton was opened as a through route in November 1849. Cosford station was opened much later than other stations on the line when the decision was taken to site an RAF base there just before the start of the Second World War. Originally the station was known as Cosford Aerodrome Halt, but due to wartime security concerns, this was shortened to just Cosford in 1940. Trains originally ran to Wolverhampton Low Level and the GWR main line to eastbound, but were diverted to Wolverhampton High Level and the ex- LNWR Stour Valley line to Birmingham New Street in 1967. =2011-12 reconstruction= The station was closed to passengers from 29 October 2011 until 30 April 2012.National Rail Engineering work at Cosford station from Saturday 29 October 2011 until March 2012Shropshire Star Cosford railway station reopens after six-month refit (30 April 2012) Costing ¬£2.1 million Network Rail replaced the wooden 1937 station buildings as well as the platforms, which were constructed from century-old wood railway sleepers with the new platforms made from glass reinforced polymer, and the stairs leading up to them.Shropshire Star ¬£3.5 million revamp for Shropshire railway stations (13 October 2011)BBC News Cosford railway station shut during ¬£2.1m scheme work (13 October 2011) Its re-opening was delayed by 5 weeks. The redevelopment has been criticised for a lack of disabled access. Signal box The most recent Cosford signal box stood a little to the west of the station. As well as forming a block post this signal box controlled entrance and exit to up and down refuge loops and the previous rail connection into the adjacent RAF site from the up refuge loop. It has been abolished as a result of the 2006 resignalling scheme with control passing to Madeley Junction. Much of the redundant signalling equipment has been distributed to various heritage railways, the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway is believed to have received the majority. This structure is thought to have been the last signal box constructed by the Great Western Railway in Shropshire. Much of the contents and structure of this 1939 constructed signalbox has been salvaged for reuse on another heritage railway. The remaining brickwork was demolished in the small hours of Sunday 21 October 2007. Remarkably, the signalman's portacabin style privy remains in-situ as of late August 2008. The advent of longer trains destined for Ironbridge Power Station has resulted in much reduced used of the refuge loops as they are too short to accommodate the length of today's coal trains.

Stamping includes a variety of sheet-metal forming manufacturing processes, such as punching using a machine press or stamping press, blanking, embossing, bending, flanging, and coining. This could be a single stage operation where every stroke of the press produces the desired form on the sheet metal part, or could occur through a series of stages. The process is usually carried out on sheet metal, but can also be used on other materials, such as polystyrene. Progressive dies are commonly fed from a coil of steel, coil reel for unwinding of coil to a straightener to level the coil and then into a feeder which advances the material into the press and die at a predetermined feed length. Depending on part complexity, the number of stations in the die can be determined. Stamping is usually done on cold metal sheet. See Forging for hot metal forming operations. History It is believed that the first coins were struck by the Lydians in what is modern-day Turkey in the seventh century B.C. Until 1550, the hammering method of coins remained the primary method of coin- making. Marx Schwab in Germany developed a new process for stamping that involved as many as 12 men turning a large wheel to press metal into coins. In the 1880s, the stamping process was further innovated. Stamped parts were used for mass-produced bicycles in the 1880s. Stamping replaced die forging and machining, resulting in greatly reduced cost. Although not as strong as die forged parts, they were of good enough quality. Stamped bicycle parts were being imported from Germany to the United States in 1890. U.S. companies then started to have stamping machines custom built by U.S. machine tool makers. Through research and development, Western Wheel was able to stamp most bicycle parts. Several automobile manufacturers adopted stamping of parts. Henry Ford resisted the recommendations of his engineers to use stamped parts, but when his company could not satisfy demand with die forged parts, Ford was forced to use stamping. Over the history of metal stamping, forging and deep drawing, presses of all types are the backbone of metals manufacturing. The processes continue to improve in moving more metal in one press stroke. Press and interconnected automation devices increase production rates, reduce labor costs and provide more safety for workers. In today's metal stamping environment, controls such as I-PRESS with Connected Enterprise are able to capture history, send reports or the I-PRESS & Automation control can be viewed from remote or mobile devices. A new trend in gathering information on today's production for historical data. I-PRESS & Automation Control to capture historical data for metal stamping processes Operation * Bending - the material is deformed or bent along a straight line. * Flanging - the material is bent along a curved line. * Embossing - the material is stretched into a shallow depression. Used primarily for adding decorative patterns. See also Repouss√© and chasing. * Blanking - a piece is cut out of a sheet of the material, usually to make a blank for further processing. * Coining - a pattern is compressed or squeezed into the material. Traditionally used to make coins. * Drawing - the surface area of a blank is stretched into an alternate shape via controlled material flow. See also deep drawing. * Stretching - the surface area of a blank is increased by tension, with no inward movement of the blank edge. Often used to make smooth auto body parts. * Ironing - the material is squeezed and reduced in thickness along a vertical wall. Used for beverage cans and ammunition cartridge cases. * Reducing/Necking - used to gradually reduce the diameter of the open end of a vessel or tube. * Curling - deforming material into a tubular profile. Door hinges are a common example. * Hemming - folding an edge over onto itself to add thickness. The edges of automobile doors are usually hemmed. Piercing and cutting can also be performed in stamping presses. Progressive stamping is a combination of the above methods done with a set of dies in a row through which a strip of the material passes one step at a time.  Lubricant  The Tribology process generates friction which requires the use of a lubricant to protect the tool and die surface from scratching or galling. The lubricant also protects the sheet metal and finished part from the same surface abrasion as well as facilitate elastic material flow preventing rips, tears and wrinkles. There are a variety of lubricants available for this task. They include plant and mineral oil based, animal fat or lard based, graphite based, soap and acrylic based dry films. The newest technology in the industry is polymer based synthetic lubricants also known as oil-free lubricants or non- oil lubricants. The term \\"Water-Based\\" lubricant refers to the larger category that also includes more traditional oil and fat based compounds. Simulation Sheet metal forming simulation is a technology that calculates the process of sheet metal stamping, predicting common defects such as splits, wrinkles, springback and material thinning. Also known as forming simulation, the technology is a specific application of non-linear finite element analysis. The technology has many benefits in the manufacturing industry, especially the automotive industry, where lead time to market, cost and lean manufacturing are critical to the success of a company. Recent research by the Aberdeen research company (October 2006) found that the most effective manufacturers spend more time simulating upfront and reap the rewards towards the end of their projects. Stamping simulation is used when a sheet metal part designer or toolmaker desires to assess the likelihood of successfully manufacturing a sheet metal part, without the expense of making a physical tool. Stamping simulation allows any sheet metal part forming process to be simulated in the virtual environment of a PC for a fraction of the expense of a physical tryout. Results from a stamping simulation allow sheet metal part designers to assess alternative designs very quickly to optimize their parts for low cost manufacture. Microstamping While the concept of stamping sheet metal components has traditionally focused on the macro level (e.g. vehicle, aircraft, and packaging applications), the continuing trend of miniaturization has driven research into micro- forms of stamping. From the early development of micropunching machines in the early to mid-2000s to the creation and testing of a microbending machine at Northwestern University in the 2010s, microstamping tools continue to be researched as alternatives to machining and chemical etching. Examples of applications of sheet metal microstamping include electrical connectors, micromeshes, microswitches, microcups for electron guns, wristwatch components, handheld device components, and medical devices. However, key issues such as quality control, high-volume application, and the need for material research into mechanical properties must be addressed before full-scale implementation of the technology is realized. Industry-specific applications Metal stamping can be applied to a variety of materials based on their unique metalworking qualities for a number of applications across a wide range of industries. Metal stamping may require the forming and processing of base common metals to rare alloys for their application-specific advantages. Some industries require the electrical or thermal conductivity of beryllium copper in areas such as aerospace, electrical, and the defense industry, or the high strength application of steel and its many alloys for the automotive industry.

The lake is about 5 km long and divided in two by a strip of sand in the middle. The lake is particularly known for the diversity of its flora and fauna and is surrounded by swamps and canals that drain the whole local basin into the sea. Due to Lake Atanasovsko's high salt content that increases every year because of its link with the sea, salt has been produced in it since 1906, with 40,000 tons of sea salt produced a year. The lake's north part, a nature reserve since 1980, is connected by a canal to the Black Sea, while the smaller south part, which is mostly used for salt production, serves as a buffer zone for the reserve. A road connecting Varna with Burgas passes through the sand strip in the middle of the lake. Ecology Burgas seen from across the lake The lake is home to over 230 species of vascular plants, of which 7 are endangered in Bulgaria. It is also inhabited by the Etruscan pygmy shrew, the smallest mammal by mass. Lake Atanasovsko is one of the key ornithological locations in the country, with 314 species of birds being present, 70% of all bird species in Bulgaria. Twelve of them are globally endangered, including the pygmy cormorant, the red-breasted goose, the ferruginous duck, the Dalmatian pelican and the corn crake. Seventeen local species of birds in danger of extinction in Bulgaria also live in the lake, including the common tern and Audouin's gull. The high number of birds is due to the lake's location on the important Via Pontica bird migration route. The bird population is highest during the autumn migration. As of August, 2019, Lake Atanasovsko is home to the largest colony of flamingos in Bulgaria, numbering 159 individuals, having grown from 126 in autumn, 2018. So far, the birds are not nesting or breeding at the site, but this is expected to occur.

As the newspaper retained ownership of sister station WTAG, Knight was required to change WTAG-FM's call sign. With the concurrent advent of FM stereo broadcasting, the station took the call letters WSRS, which stood for \\"Worcester's Stereo Radio Station\\". Knight later purchased WTAG from the Telegram & Gazette in 1987. The station continued to offer an instrumental based easy listening format well into the 1980s. By then, though, WSRS began mixing softer pop songs into the format. By 1982, WSRS was playing one vocalist per quarter-hour. Half were adult contemporary/baby boomer artists, and half were adult standards singers . By 1984, the station was about half vocal and half instrumental. In 1985, WSRS evolved into more of a vocal-based easy-listening format with the instrumentals eliminated, except for hits such as \\"Music Box Dancer,\\" \\"Chariots of Fire,\\" \\"Rise\\" and \\"Theme from A Summer Place.\\" In 1986, WSRS cut back on standards artists and evolved into more of a soft adult contemporary sound. By 1989, more uptempo artists were heard, along with Motown and other pop 1960s hits. The DJs also began adding more personality to their presentations. WSRS still played almost no current music. By 1994, WSRS had made the transition to a mainstream adult contemporary station. In 1997, WSRS and WTAG were sold to Capstar Broadcasting.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-217 In 1999, as a result of a merger with Chancellor Media, AMFM Broadcasting became the owner of WTAG and WSRS. Clear Channel Communications assumed ownership of the station in a 2000 merger with AMFM. In 2014, Clear Channel was renamed iHeartMedia, Inc. Starting in the early 2000s, WSRS switches to all-Christmas music every mid-November, lasting until Christmas Day. After Christmas 2015, the station re-branded from \\"96.1 WSRS\\" to \\"96-1 SRS\\" (no longer saying the decimal point or the W). It began using the new slogan of \\"Today's Variety.\\" Although the old web site address of wsrs.com still worked, 961srs.com was introduced along with a new logo. HD Radio In 2004, WSRS began broadcasting in the HD Radio hybrid format, simulcasting the analog audio on its HD1 subchannel. In 2007, it added \\"Pride Radio,\\" an iHeartRadio LGBTQ dance music service, to the WSRS-HD2 subchannel. In 2009, Pride Radio was temporarily replaced by a classic hits type format for a couple of months, then returned for a while.

It was originally published by Image Comics in 2002.  Plot  A parody of mainstream superhero comics, the story details the brief career of an unnamed prostitute given superhuman powers by an alien called the Viewer. The Pro reluctantly joins the League of Honor which is a parody of the Justice League, composed of the Saint, the Knight & the Squire, the Lady, the Lime, and Speedo who are a parody of Superman, Batman & Robin, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and the Flash, respectively. Together, the League fight an array of lackluster villains, such as The Noun and The Adverb, until the Pro‚Äôs coarse language and actions, violence, bloody retributions, and her fellating The Saint result in her being expelled from the League. The Pro rejoins them to fight a terrorist attack, flying into space holding a nuclear bomb, and facing death (more in an effort to save the life of her young child than anyone else in the vicinity). Later editions feature an additional eight-page story entitled \\"The Pro Vs. The Ho\\" in which the Pro squares off with a 12-armed prostitute. In the story, the Ho receives powers in much the same way that the Pro does via the alien \\"Viewer\\" that orbits the Earth in a cloaked ship. Because the Pro has superpowers, she is able to perform sex acts using superspeed. The problem arises when several of the Johns complain that by the time they relax enough to enjoy themselves, their \\"job\\" is over. The Ho then appears and confronts the Pro, who knocks her into the river and eventually saves her from drowning. Subsequently the two women get to know one another. The Ho explains that she never wanted superhuman powers, and all she ever wanted to do was work with small animals as a veterinarian. The Pro resolves to take the Ho to animal husbandry facility where she uses all 12 of her arms to \\"service\\" the animals for breeding. In other media On June 15, 2010, 5finity Productions released a limited edition sketch card series, including original art by Amanda Conner, Jimmy Palmotti and notable sketch card artists.

The Cavalry stetson was the headgear typical of cavalrymen during the late 18th century into the 19th century, including the Indian Wars and the Civil War. Before John B. Stetson, for whom the hat is named, introduced the Boss of the Plains hat in 1865, troopers wore hats in a similar style, but quickly adopted the Boss of the Plains as an unofficial standard. Current use In the modern United States Army, the Stetson was revived as an unauthorized, unofficial headgear for the sake of esprit de corps in the Cavalry. Because they are not authorized by AR 670-1, the regulation for wear and appearance of the uniform, wear and use of the Stetson and the similar spurs is regulated by the unit commander.

This results in the differentiation between \\"walk-on\\" players and \\"scholarship\\" players. Often walk-on athletes are relegated to the scout team, and may not even be placed on the official depth chart or traveling team. However, there are occasions, sometimes well publicized, where a walk-on will become a noted member of their team. General parameters *Due to scholarship limits instituted by the NCAA, many football teams do not offer scholarships to their punters, long snappers and kickers until they have become established producers. *Sometimes injury or outside issues can ravage the depth chart of a particular position, resulting in the elevation of a walk-on to a featured player. *In other situations, a walk-on may so impress the coaching staff with their play on the scout team and in practice that they are rewarded with a scholarship and made a part of the regular depth chart. Often, it is the players who achieve success in this manner that are the inspiration for future walk-ons. One significant college football national award, the Burlsworth Trophy - named for the eventual All-American former walk-on offensive lineman at the University of Arkansas, Brandon Burlsworth - has been awarded since 2010 to the most outstanding player in the top-level Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) who began his college career as a walk-on. The only two-time recipient of the Burlsworth Trophy, Baker Mayfield (2015 and 2016), won the 2017 Heisman Trophy. He began his college career as a walk-on at Texas Tech University before transferring to the University of Oklahoma, where he received all of the aforementioned awards. *Also, there are times where a walk-on will be a dependable member of the team's practice and scout teams for several years. If a team has an extra scholarship, it may award it to the player as a token of appreciation for their hard work and devotion to the team, although the player may never actually play in a game. * Finally, in rare cases, an established scholarship player may become a walk-on in order to open up their scholarship for another player. Three such cases in men's college basketball have received notoriety in recent years: ** In 2011‚Äì12, three Louisville scholarship players, most notably Kyle Kuric and Chris Smith, became walk-ons to bring the Cardinals' scholarship totals down to the NCAA limit of 13. ** In 2013‚Äì14, Creighton's Doug McDermott (the son of Creighton's head coach) became a walk-on after a teammate was granted a rare sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA, putting the Bluejays over the 13-scholarship limit. ** In 2014‚Äì15, Xavier starting center Matt Stainbrook enrolled in the school's MBA program and gave up his scholarship for his younger brother Tim, who had been a walk-on at Xavier the year before, in order to save their family a five-figure amount in school expenses. This led him to become a driver for the on-demand car service Uber, which gained him significant notoriety during that season. Purpose The reasons athletes choose to pursue the path of a walk- on include: *The athlete is already receiving praise, but the school they are particularly interested in does not share the level of interest. This target team could either be considered more athletically prestigious, it may already be saturated at that position or the athlete chooses that school for purely academic reasons over others. The walk-on will join the team to try to win the coaches over. *The athlete may be a family member of a notable former player, alumnus or coach of the school. Often these players do not strive to be placed in a starting position, but rather to carry on the tradition of being a part of a particular team. *In the case of punters and kickers, there may not be a scholarship available, but the coaches may have encouraged or invited them to join the team without offering an athletic scholarship. *The athlete has not been noticed or taken seriously by recruiters. This can be the result of either not playing the respective sport while in high school or, more commonly, the prospective walk-on played the sport in high school, and perhaps even at an exceptional level, but the level of competition around the player was subpar and led scouts to dismiss the player's ability to adapt to the college game (this is often the case in rural districts where the local public school is often the only option for high school other than homeschooling). In this case, the same drawbacks that prevent the athlete from receiving the athletic scholarship may also prevent the student from even gaining admission to higher-level colleges. *In some instances, a college coach or recruiter may designate an athlete as a \\"preferred walk-on\\" during the scouting process. In this situation, the athlete is assured a spot on the team, but the coach is unable or unwilling to offer a scholarship. In collegiate sports Many schools that do not provide athletic scholarships still recruit student athletes, and these students can get admitted to a school with academic records that are below average for that school. The Ivy League, for example, does not permit athletic scholarships, but each school has a limited number of athletes it can recruit for each sport. Additionally, all prospective athletes are required to meet a minimum score on what the league calls the Academic Index (AI), a metric based largely on high school grade-point averages and SAT or ACT scores. The goal of the AI is to ensure that students who receive athletic admissions slots fall within one standard deviation of the credentials of the student body as a whole. Division III athletes cannot receive athletic scholarships, but frequently get an easier ride through admissions. Even though these students do not receive athletic scholarships and are not required to play to remain in school, they are not walk-ons, because they were recruited. Instead of being awarded an athletic scholarship, they were granted an athletic admissions slot to a school to which they ordinarily would not have been likely to have gained admission.

The portion open to the public (the catacombs) is only a small part of an extensive network of tunnels, which spans around in length.

There is a ‚Ç¨60 fine for people caught by the E.R.I.C - the special police who patrol the mines (colloquially known as \\"cataflics\\").

The Germans' main push towards Gdynia began on 8 September and they captured Gdynia six days later on 14 September.  Before the battle  Gdynia is a major civilian and military port on the Baltic Sea, and was an important industrial centre of the Second Polish Republic. Its defence was one of the key elements in the Polish defence plan. One of the Polish armies, Armia Pomorze, had orders to prevent German forces from breaking through the Polish Corridor that linked most of Germany with East Prussia and to defend Gdynia, Hel, Kƒôpa Oksywska and Oksywie. The forces defending Gdynia were grouped under the Land Coastal Defence (LƒÖdowa Obrona Wybrze≈ºa), commanded by Colonel Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbek and Naval Coastal Defence (Morska Obrona Wybrze≈ºa) Captain Stanis≈Çaw Frankowski. The Polish plan foresaw that the Germans would manage to cut off Gdynia from the main forces of Armia Pomorze; therefore, the Land Coastal Defence was tasked with defence of the coast for 8‚Äì10 days and promised reinforcements after that period. It was thus prepared for individual operations and reassigned from Armia Pomorze to the Polish Navy, and Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbek received orders directly from counter-admiral J√≥zef Unrug. The Polish Navy would support the coastal defence with 1 destroyer (); 3 other destroyers had been evacuated from the Baltic Sea during Plan Peking), 1 heavy minelayer () and several submarines and smaller surface ships. On 1 September the Polish Land Coastal Defence force had a strength of approximately 17,000 (increased from about 5,000 two months earlier), with 40 artillery pieces (including 8 anti-aircraft), 34 mortars and granade launchers and approximately 400 machine guns. Infantry units were placed: * west and Wejherowo: * south of Gdynia, at Red≈Çowo * at Kartuzy * at Koleczkowo * at Gdynia and Kƒôpa Oksywska The German forces tasked with the capture of Gdynia were commanded by General Leonhard Kaupisch and formed part of the Army Group North under General Fedor von Bock. They were approximately 29,000 strong, with over 300 artillery pieces, 70 mortars and grenade launchers and 700 machine guns. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) in the area consisted of 2 old battleships, 3 cruisers, 10 destroyers and several smaller units. Approximately 120 Luftwaffe (aircraft) planes were supporting the German forces.  Battle  The German offensive isolated the Polish coast from the Polish mainland between 4 and 8 September, and Armia Pomorze was forced to retreat south-east. Units of Land Coastal Defence has been engaged by the German forces from 1 September, although it was not until the second week of the war that the Germans would begin a direct assault on the Polish port of Gdynia. The Kriegsmarine, operating in the area with the pre-dreadnought Schleswig-Holstein and smaller units shelled Polish positions, but with limited effect, and were prevented from closing on the coast by Polish coastal batteries. The German land offensive was much more successful. German forces established a connection between Germany and Prussia by 4 September. After heavy fighting near Kartuzy (5 September), their main attack towards Gdynia began on 8 September, and after intense fighting near Puck and Wejherowo (8 September) step by step the Poles were forced back towards the sea. When the Polish positions outside Gdynia were overrun, and in view of the retreat of the Armia Pomorze, on 10 September Colonel DƒÖbek decided to abandon Gdynia in order to avoid civilian casualties during the city fighting, and thus on 12 September he ordered all Polish units to retreat from Gdynia toward Kƒôpa Oksywska, a fragment of the coast near Puck Bay. On 11 and 12 September the fights near Mechlinki transformed into an incessant two-day battle, after which Polish troops had to retreat again. The Germans captured Gdynia on 14 September. Kƒôpa Oksywska was not prepared for siege or provisioned for the approximately 9,000 strong remaining Polish forces and in the battle of Kƒôpa Oksywska the Poles sustained heavy losses (approximately 2,000). After a last failed counterattack on 19 September, Colonel DƒÖbek, who participated in the front line battle and was wounded, decided to issue order to surrender and committed suicide after giving the order to cease fire. The Polish Navy was tasked to provide support to Gdynia through Plan Worek (submarine operations) and Operation Rurka (laying a mine barrage in Gda≈Ñsk Bay). The five submarines assigned to Plan Worek left their war stations in early September. Three submarines faced internment in neutral ports. Two reached Great Britain. One mine set by a submarine sank a German minesweeper. As for Operation Rurka, a German air attack on September 1 left the minelaying vessel damaged, unused mines were dumped into the sea, and the vessel docked in the port in Hel where no mines were readily available, which led to cancellation of the operation.  Quote  * Polish soldiers fought gallantly, and they did not spare blood. The area of Gdynia and Danzig was defended by the elite of the Polish armed forces. Those were young and inspired units of the navy and army, which fought admirably. On the plateau of Oxh√∂ft we found trenches filled with dead Polish soldiers, who fell by hundreds where they fought, with the rifles still in their hands. It was apparent, that they fought to the bitter end. from F. O.

Species such as R. moorei are critically so, with only two specimens known, last seen in 1993 (IUCN report). R. louvelii is little better off, with fewer than 25 plants known (IUCN report). Overall, less than 50 trees of several species are still alive. Historical data indicates that populations are still decreasing for most, except for Ravenea sambiranesis and Ravenea madagascariensis. The species listed as critically endangered will most likely become extinct this century unless measures are taken to cultivate new trees and protect their habitats from being disrupted by deforestation and water pollution. Even if as few as a dozen trees of each species were planted on ideal, protected land where they could reproduce, it would give each species a much better chance for survival.

It is an adaptable palm that looks somewhat similar to the ever-popular Queen palm. It is a very large palm with a large, untidy crown. It has symmetrical leaves and develops an attractive swollen base of the trunk. Majesty palms prefer full sun, plenty of water, and high humidity to ensure healthy growth. It is tolerant of different soil types. Propagation is by seeds, which germinate in 2‚Äì3 months.

The station has two platforms. Services Codsall is typically served by two trains per hour in each direction between Birmingham New Street and Shrewsbury via Wolverhampton. One train in each direction stops at all stations on the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury line, whereas the second service only calls at Codsall, , and Wellington. These services are operated by West Midlands Trains with some extra trains at peak times on weekdays. There are fewer trains on Sundays, typically one every hour. Three early services also finish at Walsall in the morning on weekdays only. Two continue to Shrewsbury from Walsall. Recent history The original listed GWR footbridge, between the two platforms and which dated from 1883, was accidentally destroyed by contractors using a road-rail crane in June 2005. Five of the original cast iron columns have been damaged beyond repair. The replacement replica columns were cast at Barr and Grosvenor's foundry in Wolverhampton during 2007. Approximately 70% of the original wrought iron span was found to be salvageable for reuse in the replacement which has been rebuilt a little higher than the original to comply with current regulations. The GWR signal box stood slightly to the east of Codsall station. It was taken out of use and control of the area passed to Madeley Junction as a result of the 2006 resignalling scheme. The lever and locking frame from the signal box were recovered by Network Rail for re-use in the south-west of England. The remaining re-usable parts of the signal box have been relocated to the Dean Forest Railway. The station house on the westbound platform has undergone a renovation in recent years and is now home to a CAMRA award-winning public house known as The Station. This opened in 1999 under the licence of Holdens Brewery. none Notes Further reading * External links Category:South Staffordshire District Category:Railway stations in Staffordshire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1849 Category:Railway stations served by West Midlands Trains Category:Railway stations served by Transport for Wales Rail Category:1849 establishments in England ","title":"Codsall railway station"},{"id":"4841896","text":"Stephen Bourke is an Australian archaeologist of the ancient Near East.

Ubba (probably died 878) was a ninth-century Viking, and one of the commanders of the Great Army that invaded Anglo-Saxon England in the 860s. The Great Army appears to have been a coalition of warbands drawn from Scandinavia, Ireland, the Irish Sea region, and the Continent. There is reason to suspect that a proportion of the Viking forces specifically originated in Frisia, where some Viking commanders are known to have held fiefdoms on behalf of the Franks. Some sources describe Ubba as ' of the Frisians, which could be evidence that he also associated with a Frisian benefice. In 865 the Great Army, apparently led by Ivar the Boneless, overwintered in the Kingdom of East Anglia, before invading and destroying the Kingdom of Northumbria. In 869, having been bought off by the Mercians, the Vikings conquered the East Angles, and in the process killed their king, Edmund, a man who was later regarded as a saint and martyr. While near-contemporary sources do not specifically associate Ubba with the latter campaign, some later, less reliable sources associate him with the legend of Edmund's martyrdom. In time, √çvarr and Ubba came to be regarded as archetypal Viking invaders and opponents of Christianity. As such, Ubba features in several dubious hagiographical accounts of Anglo-Saxon saints and ecclesiastical sites. Non-contemporary sources also associate √çvarr and Ubba with the legend of Ragnarr lo√∞br√≥k, a figure of dubious historicity. Whilst there is reason to suspect that Edmund's cult was partly promoted to integrate Scandinavian settlers in Anglo-Saxon England, the legend of Ragnarr lo√∞br√≥k may have originated in attempts to explain why they came to settle. After the fall of the East Anglian kingdom, leadership of the Great Army appears to have fallen to Bagsecg and H√°lfdan, who campaigned against the Mercians and West Saxons. In 873 the Great Army is recorded to have split. Whilst H√°lfdan settled his followers in Northumbria, the army under Guthrum, Oscytel, and Anwend, struck out southwards, and campaigned against the West Saxons. In the winter of 877/878, Guthrum launched a lightning attack deep into Wessex. There is reason to suspect that this strike was coordinated with the campaigning of a separate Viking force in Devon. This latter army is reported to have been destroyed at ' in 878. According to a near-contemporary source, this force was led by a brother of √çvarr and H√°lfdan, and some later sources identify this man as Ubba himself. Origins of Ubba and the Great Army In the mid ninth century, an invading Viking army coalesced in Anglo-Saxon England.

The same source, and the tenth- or eleventh-century Historia de sancto Cuthberto, describe Ubba as ' of the Frisians.

One possibility is that world could mean \\"people from the River Scheldt\\".Anderson, CE (2016) pp. 462 n. 5, 470 n. 22; Lewis (2016) pp. 22‚Äì23; de Rijke (2011) p. 67; McLeod, SH (2011) p. 142; Gazzoli (2010) p. 36; Woolf (2007) p. 72; Besteman (2004) p. 105; Woolf (2004) p. 95; Frank (2000) p. 159; Van Heeringen (1998) p. 245; Bj√∂rkman (1911‚Äì1912). This could indicate that Ubba was from Walcheren, an island in the mouth of the Scheldt.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 142; Woolf (2007) p. 72. Walcheren is known to have been occupied by Danish Vikings over two decades before. For example, Annales Bertiniani reports that Lothair I, King of Middle Francia (died 855) granted the island to a Viking named Herioldus in 841.Lewis (2016) p. 7; McLeod, SH (2011) p. 143; Woolf (2007) p. 72; Nelson (1991) p. 51; Lund (1989) pp. 47, 49 n. 16; Waitz (1883) p. 26 ¬ß 841; Pertz (1826) p. 438 ¬ß 841. Another possibility is that this term simply refers to Scyldings, an ancient lineage from which Danish monarchs of the time claimed descent. According to the same source and the ninth-century Annales Fuldenses, another Viking named Roricus was granted a large part of Frisia as a benefice or fief from Lothair in 850.Lewis (2016) p. 7; McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 144, 177, 177 n. 375, 199; Reuter (1992) p. 30 ¬ß 850; Nelson (1991) p. 69 ¬ß 850; Pertzii; Kurze (1891) p. 39 ¬ß 850; Waitz (1883) p. 38 ¬ß 850; Pertz (1826) p. 445 ¬ß 850. As men who held military- and judicial authority on behalf of the Franks, Herioldus and Roricus can also be regarded as Frisian '. Although it is uncertain whether Ubba was a native Frisian or a Scandinavian expatriate, if he was indeed involved with a Frisian benefice his forces would have probably been partly composed of Frisians. If his troops were drawn from the Scandinavian settlement started by Herioldus over two decades before, many of Ubba's men might well have been born in Frisia.Woolf (2007) p. 72. In fact, the length of Scandinavian occupation suggests that some of the Vikings from Frisia would have been native Franks and Frisians. The considerable time that members of the Great Army appear to have spent in Ireland and the Continent suggests that these men were well accustomed to Christian society, which in turn may partly explain their successes in Anglo-Saxon England.

The ninth-century Frisian fiefdom of Roricus appears to have encompassed a region around Dorestad, Walcheren, and Wieringen.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 143 map. 3. Also that year, Annales Bertiniani reports that Charles II, King of West Francia (died 877) paid off a Viking fleet stationed on the Seine.Lewis (2016) p. 16; Gigov (2011) p. 76; McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 140‚Äì141; Nelson (1991) p. 130 ¬ß 866; Waitz (1883) p. 81 ¬ß 866; Pertz (1826) p. 471 ¬ß 866.

(either Hollandse IJssel or Gelderse IJssel).Lewis (2016) p. 16. Although the destination of the rest of the fleet is unrecorded, one possibility is that it participated in the sack of York. The fact that the Great Army remained in East Anglia for about a year before it attacked Northumbria could mean that it had been reinforced from the Continent during the layover.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 141. The part of the fleet that went to Frisia is later stated to have been unable to secure an alliance with Lothair. This statement seems to suggest that these Vikings had intended to acquire a grant of lands in the region, which could mean that they thereafter took part in the Great Army's campaigning across the Channel.Lewis (2016) p. 16; McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 141, 165, 176; Nelson (1991) pp. 131‚Äì132 ¬ß 866, 132 n. 12; Waitz (1883) p. 82 ¬ß 866; Pertz (1826) p. 471 ¬ß 866. Furthermore, Annales Bertiniani notes that Roricus was forced from Frisia the following year. This ejection could also account for the evidence of a Frisian dimension to the Great Army, and for the attestations of Ubba himself.McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 146, 165, 176; Nelson (1991) pp. 139‚Äì140 ¬ß 867, 132 n. 8; Waitz (1883) p. 87 ¬ß 867; Pertz (1826) p. 475 ¬ß 867.

According to both sources, the Mercians made peace with the Vikings. It was probably on account of this seemingly purchased peace that the Great Army relocated to York, as reported by the chronicle, where it evidently renewed its strength for future forays.Somerville; McDonald (2014) p. 231 ¬ß 869; Gigov (2011) p. 19; McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 11, 199; Downham (2007) p. 65; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 72; Irvine (2004) p. 48 ¬ß 869; O'Keeffe (2001) p. 58 ¬ß 870; Swanton, M (1998) pp. 70‚Äì71 ¬ß 869; Whitelock (1996) p. 197 ¬ß 869; Taylor (1983) p. 34 ¬ß 870; Conybeare (1914) p. 140 ¬ß 869; Giles (1914) p. 50 ¬ß 869; Gomme (1909) p. 59 ¬ß 869; Giles (1903) p. 352 ¬ß 869; Plummer; Earle (1892) pp. 70‚Äì71 ¬ß 869; Thorpe (1861a) pp. 134‚Äì135 ¬ß 869/870; Thorpe (1861b) p. 60 ¬ß 869; Stevenson, J (1853) p. 43 ¬ß 869.

Whilst this source's claim that Edmund was martyred after being captured is not implausible,Mostert (2014); Frantzen (2004) p. 55; Mostert (1987) pp. 42‚Äì43; Whitelock (1969) pp. 221‚Äì222. the fact that he came to regarded as a martyr does not negate the possibility that he was slain in battle (as suggested by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle).McGuigan (2015) p. 21; Ridyard (2008) p. 66; Gransden (1985) p. 2; Whitelock (1969) pp. 219‚Äì221. The apparent contradictory accounts of Edmund's demise given by these sources may stem from the telescoping of events surrounding an East Anglian military defeat and the subsequent arrest and execution of the king.Mostert (2014); Ridyard (2008) p. 66. In any case, surviving numismatic evidence of coins bearing Edmund's name‚Äîthe so-called St Edmund memorial coinage‚Äîreveals that he was certainly regarded as a saint about twenty years after his death.Naismith (2017) p. 290; McGuigan (2015) p. 20; Jordan, TR (2012) p. 67; Gigov (2011) pp. 63‚Äì64, 69; Bale (2009) p. 2; Fornasini (2009) p. 34; Ridyard (2008) pp. 214‚Äì216; Adams; Holman (2004); Pestell (2004) p. 76; Farmer (2004) ¬ß Edmund; Frantzen (2004) pp. 55‚Äì56; Pestell (2004) p. 77; Blackburn; Pagan (2002) pp. 1‚Äì2; Cubitt (2000) p. 63; Gransden (1995) p. 60; Farmer (1985) p. 39; Gransden (1985) p. 2; Grant (1978) p. 89; Blunt (1969) p. 253; Stenton (1963) p. 246, 246 n. 2. The reliability of Passio sancti Eadmundi is nevertheless uncertain.Gransden (1995) pp. 56‚Äì57.

Nevertheless, there is also reason to suspect that the account is little more than a collection of well-known hagiographical elements,Pinner (2010) p. 64; Ridyard (2008) pp. 212‚Äì213; Cavill (2003); Smyth (2002) p. 204; Gransden (1985) pp. 7‚Äì8. and that the composer knew little to nothing of Edmund's demise and early cult.Pinner (2010) p. 33; Cavill (2003) p. 41; Smyth (2002) pp. 135, 204; Gransden (1985) pp. 7‚Äì8. The lurid depictions of Viking invaders presented by Passio sancti Eadmundi appears to owe much to the author's otherwise known association with Fleury,Cross (2017) p. 168; Barrow (2016) p. 84; Frantzen (2004) p. 61. and specifically to the account of the Viking invasion of the Loire Valley detailed by Miracula sancti Benedicti, a ninth-century work composed by the Fleurian monk Adrevaldus (fl. 860s).Cross (2017) p. 168; Barrow (2016) pp. 84‚Äì85; de Certain (1858) pp. 71‚Äì76 chs. 33‚Äì34. In specific regard to Ubba, Passio sancti Eadmundi states that √çvarr left him in Northumbria before launching his assault upon the East Angles in 869.Lewis (2016) p. 21; Downham (2013a) p. 15 n. 30; McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 145, 202; Ridyard (2008) p. 68; McLeod, S (2006) p. 150 n. 57; Mostert (1987) p. 42; Grant (1978) pp. 82‚Äì83, 83 n. 11; Whitelock (1969) pp. 219‚Äì220, 223; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) p. 180; Hervey (1907) pp. 18‚Äì21 ch. 5; Arnold (1890) pp. 8‚Äì10 ch. 5. If this source is to be believed, it could indicate that Ubba stayed behind to ensure the cooperation of the conquered Northumbrians.McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 202‚Äì203, 202‚Äì203 n. 124. Although Vita Alfredi and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle fail to note any Viking garrisons in the conquered Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, this may merely be a consequence of their otherwise perceptible West Saxon bias.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 202. In contrast to Passio sancti Eadmundi, the twelfth-century \\"F\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle specifically identifies Ubba and √çvarr as the chiefs of the men who killed the king.Bartlett (2016) p. 18; McTurk, R (2015) p. 213; Downham (2013a) p. 15 n. 30; Jordan, TR (2012) p. 67; Gigov (2011) pp. 19‚Äì20; McLeod, SH (2011) p. 146; Finlay (2009) p. 51, 51 n. 20; Adams; Holman (2004); Costambeys (2004b); Kries (2003) pp. 52, 60; Davidson; Fisher (1999) vol. 2 p. 156 n. 38; Swanton, M (1998) p. 70 n. 2; Whitelock (1996) p. 197 n. 6; Bremmer, RH (1981) p. 77; √ì Corr√°in (1979) pp. 315, 319‚Äì320; McTurk, RW (1976) p. 119; Whitelock (1969) p. 223; Stenton (1963) p. 244 n. 2; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) p. 180; Gomme (1909) p. 59 n. 3; Mawer (1908‚Äì1909) pp. 80, 82‚Äì83; Plummer; Earle (1892) pp. 70‚Äì71 n. 6; Thorpe (1861a) p. 135 ¬ß 870; Stevenson, J (1853) p. 43 ¬ß 870, 43 n. 8. Whilst this identification could be derived from Passio sancti Eadmundi or the tenth- century Lives of the Saints,Finlay (2009) p. 51. it could merely be a mistake on the chronicler's part. In any case, later and less reliable literature covering the martyrdom associates both men with the event, revealing that this version of events was current as early as the twelfth century.Whitelock (1969) p. 223. Hagiographic association with √Übbe and Osyth √Übbe and the nuns of Coldingham disfiguring themselves whilst pursued by Vikings.Tretero (1584). Ubba is associated with the martyrdom of √Übbe, an alleged abbess of Coldingham said to have been slain by Vikings in 870.Bartlett (2016) p. 22; Pulsiano (1999) pp. 17‚Äì18, 18 n. 28. The historicity of this woman is nevertheless uncertain.Thacker (2004); Hunt (1888). The earliest accounts of the alleged events at Coldingham date to the thirteenth century. They include Chronica majora,Bartlett (2016) p. 22; Schulenburg (2001) p. 169; Anderson, AO (1908) pp. 61‚Äì62; Luard (1872) pp. 391‚Äì392. and both the WendoverSchulenburg (2001) pp. 146‚Äì147, 169; Anderson, AO (1908) p. 61 n. 1; Giles (1849) pp. 191‚Äì192; Coxe (1841) pp. 300‚Äì302. and Paris versions of Flores historiarum.Luard (2012) pp. 432‚Äì433; Anderson, AO (1908) p. 61 n. 1; Yonge (1853) pp. 409‚Äì410. According to these sources, √Übbe compelled the nuns of Coldingham to disfigure themselves to preserve their virginity from an incoming horde of Vikings. Leading by example, √Übbe is said to have cut off her nose and upper lip with a razor. When the Viking arrived the following morning, the sight of the mutilated and bloody women repelled the raiders. Nevertheless, √çvarr and Ubba are stated to have ordered the razing of the monastery, burning to death √Übbe and her faithful nuns.Cross (2017) p. 169; Skinner (2017) p. 115; Sigurdson (2014) p. 253; Schulenburg (2006); Farmer (2004) ¬ß Ebbe the Younger; Schulenburg (2001) pp. 146‚Äì147; Pulsiano (1999) pp. 17‚Äì18, 18 n. 28; Horner (1994) p. 671; Pistono (1989) p. 38; Hunt (1888). A twelfth-century depiction of Vikings attacking a town, killing men, women, and children, as depicted on folio 10r of Pierpont Morgan Library M.736.Pinner (2010) pp. 99, 100 fig. 8, 101; The Life and Miracles of St. Edmund (n.d.). Despite many lurid twelfth- century tales of ecclesiastical devastation wrought by Vikings, the principal contemporary source for this period, the ninth- or tenth-century \\"A\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, fails to note the destruction of a single Anglo- Saxon church by Scandinavians during the eighth- and ninth centuries.Barrow (2016) pp. 80‚Äì81. Although Passio sancti Eadmundi presents the invasion of East Anglia by Ubba and √çvarr as a campaign of wanton rape and murder, the account does not depict the destruction of the kingdom's monasteries.Cross (2017) p. 163; Barrow (2016) pp. 84‚Äì85. In fact, there is reason to suspect that most Anglo-Saxon monastic sites probably survived the Viking invasions of the era,Barrow (2016) p. 81; Barrow (2009). and that the East Anglian Church withstood the Viking invasions and occupation.Pestell (2004). Whilst Viking depredations of monasteries tend not to feature in sources intended for royal audiences, religious desecrations appear in sources composed for ecclesiastical audiences.Barrow (2016) pp. 91‚Äì92. There are several reasons why twelfth-century sources associate the Vikings with seemingly unhistorical atrocities against particular monasteries. For example, such depredations could explain changes in monastic observance, or the switch from monastic- to clerical observance.Barrow (2016) p. 92. Stories of Viking attacks could be used as evidence of the former possession of property claimed by religious houses centuries after the fact.Barrow (2016) p. 92; Pestell (2004) pp. 75‚Äì76. The ninth-century Viking onslaught may have also been a way in which twelfth- century commentators sought to explain what was regarded as monastic decay in tenth-century Anglo-Saxon England.Barrow (2016) p. 92; Gransden (2008) p. 278. This imagined or exaggerated religious extirpation could well have been a convenient way of accounting for the scarcity of documentary evidence concerning early religious institutions.Pestell (2004) p. 76. Twelfth-century ecclesiastical historians availed themselves of sources such as the Anglo- Saxon ChronicleBarrow (2016) p. 93. and Passio sancti Eadmundi.Cross (2017) p. 168; Barrow (2016) p. 93. The fact that the latter was particularly influential to mediaeval historians is evidenced by the frequent occurrences of √çvarr and Ubba in reports of religious atrocities.Barrow (2016) p. 93; Bartlett (2016) pp. 17‚Äì18. To mediaeval hagiographers and historians, these two figures were archetypal Viking invadersBartlett (2016) p. 17; Hayward (1999) p. 111. and emblematic opponents of Christianity.Parker, EC (2012) p. 96; Frankis (1996) pp. 234‚Äì235. Gorman (2011) p. 117 fig. 2. The accounts of √Übbe could be an example of such a constructed tale. The story appears be ultimately derived from the account of Coldingham preserved by the eighth- century Historia ecclesiastica.Barrow (2016) p. 93; Pestell (2004) p. 72. According to this source, √Üthelthryth (died 679), wife of Ecgfrith, King of Northumbria (died 685), entered the monastery under the tutelage of an abbess named √Übbe (died 683?). At some point after √Üthelthryth left Coldingham to found a monastery at Ely, Historia ecclesiastica reports that the monastery of Coldingham burned to the ground.Barrow (2016) p. 93; Ridyard (2008) p. 53; Thacker (2004); Sellar (1917) pp. 259‚Äì263 bk. 4 ch. 19, 281‚Äì284 bk. 4 ch. 25; Giles (1903) pp. 204‚Äì207 bk. 4 ch. 19, 220‚Äì223 bk. 4 ch. 25; Plummer (1896) pp. 243‚Äì246 bk. 4 ch. 17 (19), 262‚Äì266 bk. 4 ch. 23 (25). This account of Coldingham's burning was later incorporated into Liber Eliensis, a twelfth- century chronicle covering the history of √Üthelthryth's establishment at Ely.Barrow (2016) pp. 78 n. 3, 93; Fairweather (2005) pp. 40‚Äì41 bk. 1 ch. 14; Blake (1962) p. 31 bk. 1 ch. 14. The account of the burning given by Historia ecclesiastica may well be the inspiration behind the tale of facial mutilation and fiery martyrdom first associated with Coldingham by the Wendover version of Flores historiarum. To twelfth-century ecclesiasts, invented tales of ninth-century violence‚Äîparticularly violence inflicted by √çvarr and Ubba‚Äîmay have been intended to validate the refoundation of certain religious communities.Cross (2017) pp. 166‚Äì167; Barrow (2016) p. 93. The earliest Anglo- Saxon virgin-martyr is Osyth.Pulsiano (1999) p. 17. A now-lost twelfth-century ' of this woman associated √çvarr and Ubba with her seventh-century martyrdom. According to this source, √çvarr and Ubba commanded the pirates who beheaded her after she refused to worship their pagan idols.Barrow (2016) p. 90, 90 n. 69; Campbell (1984) pp. 147‚Äì148; Bethell (1970) pp. 88, 120; Toulmin Smith (1910) p. 168; Hunt (1895). This work may have been the inspiration behind the Anglo-Norman hagiography Vie seinte Osith,Barrow (2016) p. 90 n. 69; Barrow (2007); Russell; Zatta; Wogan-Browne (2005) p. 317 n. 27; Zatta (1999) p. 376 n. 27; Barrow (1987) pp. 178, 185. a composition that also attributes Osyth's killing to √çvarr and Ubba and their followers.Barrow (2016) p. 90 n. 69; Bartlett (2016) p. 22; Russell; Zatta; Wogan-Browne (2005) pp. 384‚Äì389 ¬ß¬ß 762‚Äì839; Frankis (1996) pp. 233‚Äì234; Bethell (1970) p. 88; Baker (1911) pp. 480, 491‚Äì492 ¬ß¬ß 761‚Äì838. The Great Army after √çvarr The history of East Anglia immediately after Edmund's demise is extremely obscure.Ridyard (2008) p. 211. The account of events presented by Passio sancti Eadmundi seems to show that Edmund was killed in the context of the Great Army attempting to impose authority over him and his realm.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 197; Ridyard (2008) pp. 66, 68‚Äì69, 94; McLeod, S (2006) pp. 150‚Äì151; Kirby (2002) p. 174; Gransden (1995) p. 26. Such an accommodation appears to have been gained by the Vikings in NorthumbriaLewis (2016) p. 21; Abels (2013) p. 125; Costambeys (2004a); Abels (1992) p. 33 n. 48. and Mercia.Abels (2013) p. 125; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 74; Keynes (2001) p. 54; Abels (1992) p. 33 n. 48. In any case, numismatic evidence appears to indicate that two client kings‚Äîa certain √Üthelred and Oswald‚Äîthereafter ruled over the East Angles on behalf of the Viking conquerors.Naismith (2017) pp. 147, 150 tab. 10, 164 287; McLeod, SH (2011) pp. 188‚Äì189, 194‚Äì195; Pestell (2004) pp. 66 n. 7, 78; Kirby (2002) p. 174; Keynes (2001) p. 54. It is at about this point that √çvarr disappears from English history.Abels (2013) p. 125; Downham (2007) p. 66; Stenton (1963) p. 247. According to Chronicon √Üthelweardi, he died in the same year as Edmund.Lewis (2016) p. 22; McTurk, R (2015) pp. 42, 46‚Äì47, 213; Downham (2013a) p. 16 n. 33; Downham (2011) p. 192; McLeod, SH (2011) p. 127; Downham (2007) p. 66; McTurk, R (2006) p. 681; Costambeys (2004b); Keynes; Lapidge (2004) ch. asser's life of king alfred ¬ß 33 n. 61; √ì Corr√°in (1979) pp. 315, 319; McTurk, RW (1976) p. 117 n. 174; Whitelock (1969) pp. 223, 227 n. 49; Barker (1967) p. 82; Giles (1906) p. 26 bk. 4 ch. 2; Stevenson, J (1854) p. 428 bk. 4 ch. 2. However, this record may partly stem from the fact that he did not take part in the subsequent war against the Kingdom of Wessex,Downham (2007) p. 66; Costambeys (2004b). beginning in the autumn or winter of 870. In any case, the leadership of the Great Army appears to have fallen to kings Bagsecg (died 871) and H√°lfdan (died 877),Holm (2015); Abels (2013) p. 125; Yorke (1995) p. 109. the first principal Viking leaders attested by all versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle after the army's recorded arrival.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 123; √ì Corr√°in (1979) p. 316. barrow at Lanhill, near Chippenham and Avebury, probably dates to about the third millennium BC.King; Young; Clarke; Cain; Dimbleby (1966) p. 82.

For about a year, the Great Army campaigned against the West Saxons, before overwintering in London.Costambeys (2008); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 72‚Äì73; Costambeys (2004a). Late in 872, after spending nearly a year in London, the Vikings were drawn back to Northumbria, and afterwards to Mercia.Costambeys (2008); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 73‚Äì74; Costambeys (2004a). By the end of 874, the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria were finally broken.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 74‚Äì75. At this point, the Great Army split. Whilst H√°lfdan settled his followers in Northumbria, the army under Guthrum (died 890), Oscytel (fl. 875), and Anwend (fl. 875), struck out southwards, and based itself at Cambridge.Lewis (2016) p. 20; Downham (2013a) p. 22; Costambeys (2008); Ridyard (2008) p. 211; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 75; Costambeys (2004a); Keynes (2001) p. 54. In 875, the Vikings invaded Wessex and seized Wareham. Although Alfred, King of Wessex (died 899) sued for peace in 876, the Vikings broke the truce the following year, seized Exeter, and were finally forced to withdraw back to Mercia.Downham (2013a) pp. 22‚Äì23; Costambeys (2008); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 75‚Äì76.

Setting off from their base in Gloucester, the latter source specifies that the Vikings drove deep into Wessex, and sacked the royal vill of Chippenham.Baker; Brookes (2013) pp. 217, 240; Downham (2013a) p. 23; Keynes; Lapidge (2004) ch. asser's life of king alfred ¬ß 52; Smyth (2002) pp. 25 ch. 52; 185‚Äì187, 225 nn. 146‚Äì147; Swanton, M (1998) p. 75 n. 9; Conybeare (1914) p. 109 ¬ß 52 ch. 52; Cook (1906) pp. 26‚Äì27 ch. 52; Giles (1906) pp. 59‚Äì60; Stevenson, WH (1904) pp. 40 ch. 52, 25; Stevenson, J (1854) p. 457.

These numbers roughly give about thirty-six and a half men per ship, which is comparable to the thirty-two oared Gokstad ship, a ninth-century Viking ship unearthed in Norway. On one hand, it is possible that the Viking commander at ' seized upon Guthrum's simultaneous campaigning against the West Saxons to launch a Viking foray of his from Dyfed.Abels (2013) p. 154. On the other hand, the location and timing of the engagement at ' may indicate that the slain commander was cooperating with Guthrum. As such, there is reason to suspect that the two Viking armies coordinated their efforts in an attempt to corner Alfred in a pincer movement after his defeat at Chippenham and subsequent withdrawal into the wetlands of Somerset. If the Vikings at ' were indeed working in cooperation with those at Chippenham, the record of their presence in Dyfed could also have been related to Guthrum's campaign against Alfred. As such, they could have been campaigning against Hyfaidd ap Bleddri, King of Dyfed (died 892/893) before their attack at '.Downham (2007) p. 204. Old Burrow, near Countisbury, the site of a ruined Roman fortress, is another possible site of '. It is possible that the defeat at ' left Guthrum overextended in Wessex, allowing Alfred's forces to assail Guthrum's exposed lines of communication.Kirby (2002) p. 175. Although Alfred's position may have been still perilous in the aftermath, with his contracted kingdom close to collapse, the victory at ' certainly foreshadowed a turn of events for the West Saxons. A few weeks later in May, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Alfred was able to assemble his troops, and launch a successful attack against Guthrum at Edington.Somerville; McDonald (2014) pp. 233‚Äì234 ¬ß 878; Gigov (2011) p. 77; Smith, JJ (2009) pp. 130‚Äì131; Downham (2007) p. 71; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 76; Irvine (2004) pp. 50‚Äì51 ¬ß 878; Keynes; Lapidge (2004) ch. introduction ¬∂ 18; Kirby (2002) p. 175; O'Keeffe (2001) p. 62 ¬ß 879; Williams, A (1999) pp. 70‚Äì71; Swanton, M (1998) pp. 76‚Äì77 ¬ß 878; Whitelock (1996) p. 201 ¬ß 878; Conybeare (1914) pp. 143‚Äì144 ¬ß 878; Giles (1914) p. 54 ¬ß 878; Gomme (1909) pp. 63‚Äì64 ¬ß 878; Giles (1903) p. 356 ¬ß 878; Plummer; Earle (1892) pp. 74‚Äì77 ¬ß 878; Thorpe (1861a) pp. 146‚Äì149 ¬ß 878/879; Thorpe (1861b) pp. 64‚Äì65 ¬ß 878; Stevenson, J (1853) p. 47 ¬ß 878. Following Guthrum's crushing defeat, the Vikings were forced to accept Alfred's terms for peace. Guthrum was baptised as a Christian, and led the remainder of his forces into East Anglia, where they dispersed and settled.Downham (2013a) p. 24; Hadley (2009) p. 112; Costambeys (2008); Ridyard (2008) pp. 211‚Äì212; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 76‚Äì77; Keynes; Lapidge (2004) ch. introduction ¬∂¬∂ 18‚Äì19; Keynes (2001) p. 57; Sawyer (2001) p. 276; Williams, A (1999) p. 71.

According to the thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr, a source that forms part of the West Scandinavian tradition, √çvarr had two bastard brothers, Yngvarr and H√∫st√≥, who tortured Edmund on √çvarr's instructions.McTurk, R (2015) p. 106; Gigov (2011) pp. 16, 18, 26‚Äì27, 58‚Äì59; Waggoner (2009) pp. 70 ch. 3, 111 n. 14; Rowe, EA (2008) p. 355, 355 n. 9; Fjalldal (2003) p. 78; Halld√≥rsson (2000) pp. 54, 58‚Äì59; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936a) p. 230; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 175, 181‚Äì183, 185; Mawer (1908‚Äì1909) p. 74, 84; Rafn (1829) p. 354 ch. 3.

A depiction of √çvarr and Ubba setting forth to avenge their father, Lo√∞br√≥k, as it appears on folio 47v of British Library Harley 2278. Whilst Scandinavian sources‚Äîsuch as the thirteenth-century Ragnars saga lo√∞br√≥kar‚Äîtend to locate the legend of Ragnarr lo√∞br√≥k in a Northumbrian context, English sources tend to place them in an East Anglian setting.Whitelock (1969) pp. 225‚Äì226; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 183‚Äì184. The earliest source to specifically associate the legend with East Anglia is Liber de infantia sancti Eadmundi,Whitelock (1969) p. 228. a twelfth-century account depicting the Viking invasion of East Anglia in the context of a dynastic dispute.Frantzen (2004) p. 64. According to this source, Lo√∞br√≥k (') was extremely envious of Edmund's fame. As such, it is Lo√∞br√≥k's taunts that provoke his sons, √çvarr, Ubba, and Bj«´rn ('), to slay Edmund and destroy his kingdom.McTurk, R (2015) p. 8; Pinner (2015) p. 76; Parker, E (2014) p. 489; Jordan, TR (2012) p. 87; Parker, EC (2012) pp. 96‚Äì97, 102; Gigov (2011) pp. 10‚Äì11, 42‚Äì44; Pinner (2010) p. 123; Hayward (2009) p. 69; Frantzen (2004) p. 64; Thomson (1977) pp. 41‚Äì42; Whitelock (1969) p. 228; Hervey (1907) pp. 156‚Äì161; Arnold (1890) pp. 102‚Äì103. Although this text is heavily dependent upon Passio sancti Eadmundi for its depiction of Edmund's death, it appears to be the first source to meld the martyrdom with the legend of Ragnarr lo√∞br√≥k. Appledore and Northam. In the early nineteenth century, it was imagined that this spot may have marked the site of Ubba's demise.Stevenson, WH (1904) pp. 262‚Äì263, 262 n. 3; Thurnam (1857) p. 85; Vidal (1806) p. 207. By the thirteenth century an alternate rendition of the story appears in sources such as Chronica majora,Reinhard (1941) p. 58; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 183‚Äì185; Luard (1872) pp. 393‚Äì399. and both the WendoverParker, E (2016) p. 433; Parker, E (2014) p. 489; Parker, EC (2012) pp. 97, 102, 102 n. 258, 206; Gigov (2011) pp. 41‚Äì42, 44; Pestell (2004) p. 78, 78 n. 74; Whitelock (1969) pp. 229‚Äì230; Reinhard (1941) p. 58; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 183‚Äì186; Hervey (1907) pp. 170‚Äì191; Giles (1849) pp. 193‚Äì199; Coxe (1841) pp. 303‚Äì312. and Paris versions of Flores historiarum.Luard (2012) pp. 433‚Äì440; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 183‚Äì185; Reinhard (1941) p. 58; Yonge (1853) pp. 409‚Äì418. For example, the Wendover account states that Lo√∞br√≥k (') washed ashore in East Anglia, where he was honourably received by Edmund, but afterwards murdered by Bj«´rn ('), an envious huntsman. Although the latter is expelled from the realm, he convinces Lo√∞br√≥k's sons, √çvarr and Ubba, that the killer of their father was Edmund. As such, East Anglia is invaded by these two sons, and Edmund is killed in a case of misplaced vengeance.Parker, E (2016) p. 433; Pinner (2015) p. 86; Parker, E (2014) p. 489; Jordan, TR (2012) pp. 98‚Äì99; Parker, EC (2012) pp. 97, 102, 102 n. 258, 206; Gigov (2011) pp. 11, 41‚Äì42, 44; Pinner (2010) pp. 134‚Äì135; Finlay (2009) p. 56; Pestell (2004) p. 78 n. 74; Fjalldal (2003) p. 101 n. 3; Whitelock (1969) pp. 229‚Äì230; Reinhard (1941) p. 58; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 183‚Äì186; Hervey (1907) pp. 170‚Äì191; Giles (1849) pp. 193‚Äì199; Coxe (1841) pp. 303‚Äì312. A slightly different version of events is offered by Estoire des Engleis, which states that the Vikings invaded Northumbria on behalf of Bj«´rn ('), who sought vengeance for the rape of his wife by the Northumbrian king, Osberht.Parker, E (2016) pp. 432‚Äì433; McTurk, R (2015) p. 215; Parker, E (2014) p. 489; Parker, EC (2012) pp. 97, 102, 168, 206; Kries (2003) p. 67; Whitelock (1969) pp. 229‚Äì230; Short (2009) pp. 142‚Äì149 ¬ß¬ß 2595‚Äì2722; Sayers (2003) p. 305; Freeman (1996) p. 199; Bell (1932) pp. 169‚Äì170; Hardy; Martin (1889) pp. 84‚Äì88 ¬ß¬ß 2597‚Äì2724; Hardy; Martin (1888) pp. 104‚Äì112 ¬ß¬ß 2597‚Äì2724; Stevenson, J (1854) pp. 760‚Äì761; Wright (1850) pp. 89‚Äì93 ¬ß¬ß 2597‚Äì2724. On one hand, it is possible that the theme of vengeance directed at Edmund is derived from the tradition of √Ülla's demise in Northumbria at the hands of Ragnarr's progeny.Whitelock (1969) pp. 229‚Äì230; Smith, AH (1928‚Äì1936b) pp. 186‚Äì187. On the other hand, the revenge motifs and miraculous maritime journeys presented in the accounts of Edmund are well- known elements commonly found in contemporaneous chivalric romances.Gigov (2011) pp. 48‚Äì49; Frantzen (2004) pp. 65‚Äì66. There is reason to suspect that the legend of Ragnarr lo√∞br√≥k originated from attempts to explain why the Vikings came to settle in Anglo-Saxon England. The core of the tradition may have been constructed as a way to rationalise their arrival without assigning blame to either side (as illustrated by the sympathetic Wendover account).Parker, E (2014) pp. 489‚Äì490; Pestell (2004) p. 78, 78 n. 74. As such, the legend could have been intended to justify Edmund's violent demise.Parker, EC (2012) p. 96; Gigov (2011) pp. 53, 62. The tales may have evolved at an early stage of Viking settlement, and may have functioned as an origin myth of the emerging Anglo-Scandinavian culture.Parker, E (2014) pp. 489‚Äì490. The shared kinship assigned to √çvarr and Ubba within the legend of Ragnarr lo√∞br√≥k may stem from their combined part in Edmund's downfall as opposed to any historical familial connection.Gigov (2011) pp. 53‚Äì54.

When the stadium was first opened, it was referred to as \\"New Athletic Park\\". Later it was named Riddick Field and then Riddick Stadium, after W. C. Riddick, N.C. State football coach during the 1898 and 1899 seasons. The Wolfpack baseball team also played its home games in the stadium prior to moving to Doak Field. Prior to moving to the Riddick site, the Wolfpack had played their games at Athletic Park (now Pullen Park) and at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. The stadium initially had only wooden bleachers on the sidelines, but over the years concrete bleachers were built and a fieldhouse was erected behind the south end zone. The NC State Wolfpack defeated Florida State 3-0 in the final game ever played in Riddick Stadium on November 13, 1965. It was one of the smallest stadiums in the country; it never seated more than 23,000 people, and never had more than 14,000 permanent seats. By the 1950s, it was at the end of its useful life, and the Wolfpack were often forced to play more games on the road than at home.Longtime NCSU football coach dead at 88. Associated Press, February 26, 1997. The stadium was partially demolished in 1968, three years after the opening of its replacement, Carter Stadium (now Carter-Finley Stadium. The east stands and the field were replaced by a parking lot, and the field house became the campus police station. The west stands remained and served a number of functions through the years, including a residence hall in the 1940s and the home of the University Planning office until their demolition in the summer of 2005. The former field house, the last remaining remnant of the stadium, was demolished in March 2013. SAS Hall, the new mathematics and statistics building, occupies the former site.

Zilupe's railway station is the final station for the Riga-Zilupe train route, which is one of the longest passenger rail routes in Latvia. The town first began to take shape during construction of the Ventspils-Moscow railway line in 1900, the station taking the name Rozenova, after the former landowner. Near the station, a small settlement of merchants and railroad workers formed. In 1908 there was already a police department, school and post office in Rozenova. Further development of settlement was interrupted by First World War. In 1918 the railway bridge over Zilupe River was destroyed. From 1918 until 1920 Rozenova like all of Eastern Latvia was under soviet rule. In January 1920 Rozenova was liberated by the Latvian army in the final stage of the Latvian War of Independence. After becoming part of the Republic of Latvia the settlement was renamed after the river Zilupe. In the interwar period Zilupe was an important centre in the region. In 1925 it was granted status of the village and in 1931, town rights. Inhabitants of Zilupe were mainly involved in trade and agriculture. In the 1930s there was a water mill and sawmill in Zilupe and also a small hospital and around 120 shops. During World War II, Zilupe was occupied by the German Army from 6 July 1941 until 18 July 1944 and administered as part of Reichskommissariat Ostland. After World War II several large enterprises opened their divisions in Zilupe. These included a metal fabricating workshop, small textile factory and bakery. The town is near the A12 road, that after the border crossing into Russia turns into the M9, both of which are part of European route E22.

He was a son of Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde, and seems to have been a member of the royal dynasty of Strathclyde. At some point in the ninth- or tenth century, the Kingdom of Strathclyde expanded substantially southwards. As a result of this extension far beyond the valley of the River Clyde, the realm became known as the Kingdom of Cumbria. By 927, the kingdom seems to have reached as far south as the River Eamont. Dyfnwal appears to have reigned between the 930s and the 970s. He is first attested in the 940s, when he is recorded associated with the ecclesiast Cathr√≥e on the latter's journey to Continental Europe. At the midpoint of the decade, the Cumbrian kingdom was ravaged by the forces of Edmund, King of the English. Two of Dyfnwal's sons are said to have been blinded by the English, which could indicate that Dyfnwal had broken a pledge to his southern counterpart. One possibility is that he had harboured insular Scandinavian opponents of Edmund. The latter is recorded to have handed over control of the Cumbrian realm to M√°el Coluim mac Domnaill, King of Alba. How much authority the Scots enjoyed over the Cumbrian realm is uncertain. In 971, the reigning Cuil√©n mac Illuilb, King of Alba was slain by Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal. At some point after this act, Cuil√©n's eventual successor, Cin√°ed mac Ma√≠l Choluim, King of Alba, is recorded to have penetrated deep into Cumbrian territory, possibly as a retaliatory act. The following year, the reigning Edgar, King of the English held a remarkable assembly at Chester which numerous northern kings seem to have attended. Both Dyfnwal and his son, M√°el Coluim, appear to have attended this assembly. The latter is styled King of the Cumbrians in the context of this meeting, which might indicate that Dyfnwal had previously abdicated the throne. Dyfnwal is recorded to have died in 975 whilst undertaking a pilgrimage to Rome. Quite when he gave up the throne is unknown. One possibility is that Rhydderch had succeeded him before the killing of Cuil√©n. Another possibility is that the apparent retaliatory raid by Cin√°ed marked the end of Dyfnwal's kingship. It is also possible that he held on to power until 973 or 975. In any event, M√°el Coluim appears to have been succeeded by another son of Dyfnwal named Owain, who is recorded to have died in 1015. The later Owain Foel, King of Strathclyde, who is attested in 1018, may well be a grandson of Dyfnwal. Dyfnwal is likely the eponym of Dunmail Raise in England, and possibly Cardonald and Dundonald/Dundonald Castle in Scotland.

The catalyst for this southern extension may have been the dramatic decline of the Kingdom of Northumbria at the hands of conquering Scandinavians,Lewis (2016) p. 15; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 9, 481‚Äì482; Breeze (2006) pp. 327, 331; Hicks (2003) pp. 35‚Äì36, 36 n. 78; Woolf (2001); Macquarrie (1998) p. 19; Fellows- Jensen (1991) p. 80. and the expansion may have been facilitated by cooperation between the Britons and the insular Scandinavians in the late ninth- or early tenth century.Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 481‚Äì482.

Dyfnwal is attested by the tenth-century Life of St Cathr√≥e, which appears to indicate that he was established as king by at least the 940s. According to this source, when Cathr√≥e left the realm of Custant√≠n mac √Åeda, King of Alba at about this time, he was granted safe passage through the lands of the Cumbrians by Dyfnwal because the two men were related. Dyfnwal thereupon had Cathr√≥e escorted through his kingdom to the frontier of the Scandinavian-controlled Northumbrian territory.Evans (2015) p. 150; Keynes (2015) p. 111; McGuigan (2015b) p. 98; Molyneaux (2015) p. 24, 24 n. 30; Clarkson (2014) chs. 1 ¬∂ 25, 6 ¬∂¬∂ 4‚Äì5; Edmonds (2014) pp. 205‚Äì206; Walker (2013) ch. 3 ¬∂ 51; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 24; Broun (2004d) p. 127; Macquarrie (2004a); Macquarrie (2004b); Downham (2003) p. 27; Macquarrie (1998) pp. 15‚Äì16; Woolf (1998) p. 190; Hudson (1994) p. 174 n. 8; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 441; Skene (1867) p. 116; Colganvm (1645) p. 497 ¬ß xvii. The Life of St Cathr√≥e locates this southern frontier to the of . One possibility is that this refers to Leeds. If correct, this could indicate that the Cumbrian realm stretched towards this settlement, and would further evince the general southward expansion of the kingdom.Molyneaux (2015) p. 24, 24 n. 30; Edmonds (2014) p. 206 n. 59; Hicks (2003) p. 38. Another possibility is that refers to Leath Ward in Cumberland,Edmonds (2014) p. 206 n. 59; Hicks (2003) p. 38. or to a settlement in the Lowther valley, not terribly far from where the River Eamont flows.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 5; Edmonds (2014) p. 206 n. 59; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 24.

The fact that Cathr√≥e is stated to have been related to Dyfnwal could indicate that the former's ancestors included a Briton who possessed a genealogical connection with the royal Cumbrian dynasty,Clarkson (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 24. or that Dyfnwal possessed Scottish ancestry, or else that the families of Cathr√≥e and Dyfnwal were merely connected by way of a marriage. Cathr√≥e is also said by the source to have been related to the wife of a certain King of York named Erich.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂¬∂ 4‚Äì6, 6 n. 6; Edmonds (2014) pp. 205‚Äì206; Downham (2013) pp. 187, 203; Downham (2007) p. 119; Woolf (2007) pp. 187‚Äì188; Costambeys (2004); Macquarrie (2004a); Woolf (1998) p. 193 n. 18; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 441; Skene (1867) p. 116; Colganvm (1645) p. 497 ¬ß xvii.

Whilst it is possible that Erich actually refers to Amla√≠b mac Gofraid, if he instead refers to Eir√≠kr Haraldsson, it could be evidence that the latter had been based in the Solway region whilst the U√≠ √çmair held power in Northumbria,Woolf (1998) p. 193 n. 18. or that the latter indeed held power in Northumbria as early as about 946.Downham (2003) pp. 43, 49.

He could well have taken refuge amongst the Cumbrians,Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 16; Woolf (2007) pp. 182‚Äì183. or may have been attempting to construct a power base in the Cumbrian periphery.Woolf (2002) p. 38. The close working relationship between Edmund and M√°el Coluim mac Domnaill suggests that Amla√≠b C√∫ar√°n was unlikely to have been harboured by the Scots during this period.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 16. Edmund's strike upon Dyfnwal's realm, therefore, seems to have been undertaken as a means to break a Cumbrian-Scandinavian alliance,Fulton (2000) pp. 11, 13. and to limit the threat of an insular Scandinavian counter offensive from the Forth-Clyde region.Downham (2003) p. 42; Smyth (1989) pp. 205‚Äì206. The southward expansion of the Cumbrian realm‚Äîan extension possibly enabled by the insular Scandinavian power‚Äîmay have also factored into the invasion, with the English clawing back lost territories.Halloran (2011) p. 307. Whatever lay behind the campaign, it is possible that it was utilised by the English Cerdicing dynasty as a way to overawe and intimidate neighbouring potentates.Molyneaux (2015) pp. 33, 77‚Äì78. The Giant's Grave, a collection of apparent tenth-century monuments at Penrith. The stones display significant Scandinavian influences, and are traditionally associated with a legendary king, variably known as Owain Caesarius.

Although the Wendover version of Flores historiarum alleges that M√°el Coluim mac Domnaill was given Cumbrian territory to hold as a fief from the English, the terminology employed by the more reliable Anglo-Saxon Chronicle seems to suggest that Edmund merely surrendered or granted the region to him,Halloran (2011) p. 307; Woolf (2007) pp. 183‚Äì184. or that he merely recognised certain rights of the Scots in the region (such as the right to tribute).McGuigan (2015b) pp. 139‚Äì140; Davidson (2002) p. 115 n. 32; Hudson (1994) pp. 84‚Äì85. Edmund, therefore, may have allowed his Scottish counterpart to collect tribute from the Cumbrians in return for keeping them in check and for lending Edmund military assistance.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 20. It is possible that the territory in question corresponds to the region around Carlisle‚Äîroughly modern-day Cumberland‚Äîwhich in turn could reveal that the Scots were already in possession of the kingdom's more northerly lands.Duncan (2002) p. 23. It is conceivable that the Scots were allowed authority over Cumbrian territory because it was too far to be overseen effectively by the English themselves.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 20; Woolf (2007) p. 184. As such, it may have been recognised that the Cumbrian territories were situated within the Alp√≠nid sphere of influence rather than that of the Cerdicings.Davidson (2002) p. 116, 116 n. 36. In any event, it is uncertain what authority M√°el Coluim mac Domnaill enjoyed over the Cumbrians. Although it is possible that there was a temporary Scottish takeover of the realm,Parsons (2011) p. 129; Woolf (2007) p. 184. Dyfnwal lived on for decades, and there were certainly later kings.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 21; Woolf (2007) p. 184. In fact, the Wendover version of the Flores historiarum reveals that the Cumbrians were ruled by a king the year after Edmund's invasion.McGuigan (2015b) p. 139; Giles (1849) pp. 253‚Äì254; Coxe (1841) p. 399. The concord between the English and the Scots could have been precipitated by the former as a way of further securing their northern frontier from the threat of insular Scandinavians.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 20; Molyneaux (2011) p. 76; Williams (2004c); Downham (2003) p. 42; Smyth (1989) pp. 205‚Äì206. Similarly, the English campaign against the Cumbrians may have been undertaken in order to isolate the Scots from an alliance with the Scandinavians.Downham (2007) p. 153. In this way, Edmund's conquest and grant of Cumbrian territories to his Scottish counterpart may have been a way of winning the latter's obeisance.Downham (2007) p. 153; Fulton (2000) p. 13. The terminology used to denote an alliance of Scots, Cumbrians, and Englishmen, on folio 32r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 952.2; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 952.2; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 451; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). Edmund was assassinated in 946, and succeeded by his brother Eadred, a monarch who soon after made a show of force against opposition in Northumbria,McGuigan (2015b) pp. 83‚Äì84; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 28; Williams (2004b); Anderson, AO (1922) p. 450. and received a renewal of oaths from his Scottish counterpart.McGuigan (2015b) pp. 83‚Äì84; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 28; Davidson (2002) pp. 116‚Äì117; Fulton (2000) p. 14. In about 949/950, M√°el Coluim mac Domnaill is recorded to have raided into Northumbria, perhaps against the retrenched forces of Eadred's Scandinavian opponents.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 28; Downham (2007) pp. 154‚Äì155; Davidson (2002) p. 131, 131 n. 103; Hudson (1998) pp. 150‚Äì151, 158; Hudson (1994) pp. 86‚Äì87; Skene (1867) p. 10. Whilst it is possible that this event was undertaken in the context of compensation for the English campaigning against the Cumbrians in 946,Davidson (2002) p. 131; Hudson (1994) pp. 86‚Äì87. an alternate possibility is that this Scottish invasion was instead an opportunistic attempt to extract tribute from the Northumbrian ruler Osulf (fl. 946‚Äì950), rather than the York-based Scandinavians.Davidson (2002) pp. 131‚Äì132. In 952, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four MastersAnnals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 950.14; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 950.14; Downham (2007) p. 155; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 451 n. 4. and the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster appear to report an attack upon the Scandinavians of Northumbria by an alliance of English, Scots, and Cumbrians.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 952.2; Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 10; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 28; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 952.2; Downham (2007) pp. 155, 167; Woolf (2007) p. 188‚Äì189; Davidson (2002) pp. 60, 132, 132 n. 108; Hudson (1994) p. 87; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 451. If these two annal-entries indeed refer to Cumbrians rather than Welshmen, it would appear to indicate that the former‚Äîpresumably led by Dyfnwal himself‚Äîwere supporting the cause of the English with the Scots.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 28; Woolf (2007) pp. 188‚Äì189. One possibility is that the annal-entries record the clash of this coalition against the forces of Eir√≠kr, a man who was finally overwhelmed and slain two years later.Downham (2007) p. 155; Woolf (2007) pp. 188‚Äì189; Costambeys (2004); Davidson (2002) pp. 132‚Äì133; Hudson (1994) p. 87.

There is also reason to suspect that a man other than Dyfnwal ruled as king in the wake of Edmund's 945 campaign. For instance, a certain Cadmon is recorded to have witnessed two royal charters of Edmund's successor, Eadred‚Äîone in 946 and another in 949‚Äîwhich could be evidence that Cadmon was then the ruling Cumbrian monarch.Keynes (2015) pp. 84‚Äì85 fig. 1, 100‚Äì101, 100 n. 131; Molyneaux (2015) pp. 57 n. 45, 212, 212 n. 83; Charles- Edwards (2013b) pp. 515 tab. 16.1, 516‚Äì517; Davidson (2002) pp. 118‚Äì119; Pierquin (1912) pp. 294‚Äì295 ¬ß 86, 303‚Äì304 ¬ß 94; Birch (1893) pp. 38‚Äì40 ¬ß 883; Birch (1887) pp. 576‚Äì578 ¬ß 815; Cadfan 1 (n.d.); S 544 (n.d.); S 520 (n.d.). There may be evidence indicating that, from about the time of the campaign until at least 958, the English regarded the land of the Cumbrians as part of the English realm.Keynes (2015) pp. 96 n. 110, 107. For instance, a charter apparently issued upon Eadred's coronation‚Äîthe first of the two witnessed by Cadmon‚Äîaccords Eadred the title \\"king of the Anglo-Saxons, Northumbrians, pagans, and Britons\\",Keynes (2015) pp. 98‚Äì99, 119‚Äì120; Keynes (2001) p. 70; Pierquin (1912) pp. 294‚Äì295 ¬ß 86; Birch (1887) pp. 576‚Äì578 ¬ß 815; S 520 (n.d.). whilst a 958 charter of Eadred's royal successor Edgar accords the latter kingship over \\"the Mercians, Northumbrians and Britons\\".Keynes (2015) p. 120; Keynes (2001) p. 72; Birch (1893) pp. 242‚Äì244 ¬ß 1040; S 677 (n.d.). The fact that the acta of Edmund, Eadred, and Edgar fail to record the presence of Dyfnwal could be evidence of English rule over the Cumbrians, who may have been in turn administered by English-aligned agents.Keynes (2015) p. 107. Cumbrian and Scottish contention The name of Illulb mac Custant√≠n as it appears on 29v of Paris Biblioth√®que Nationale Latin 4126 (the Poppleton manuscript): \\".Howlett (2000) p. 65; Skene (1867) p. 131; Lat. 4126 (n.d.) fol. 29v.

At some point during the latter's reign, the Scots permanently acquired Edinburgh from the English,Taylor (2016) pp. 8‚Äì9; Broun (2015b); Broun (2004b); Davidson (2002) p. 133. as partly evidenced by the ninth- to twelfth-century Chronicle of the Kings of Alba.Taylor (2016) pp. 8‚Äì9; McGuigan (2015b) pp. 148‚Äì149; Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 35; Hudson (1998) pp. 151, 159; Duncan (2002) p. 23; Hudson (1994) pp. 89‚Äì90; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 468; Skene (1867) p. 10. Confirmation of this conquest seems to be preserved by the twelfth-century Historia regum Anglorum, a source which states that, during the reign of Edgar, King of the English, the Northumbrian frontier extended as far as the , a waterway which seems to refer to the River Tyne in Lothian.Hudson (1994) p. 89; Arnold (1885) p. 197 ch. 159; Stevenson, J (1855) p. 557. The acquisition of Edinburgh, and extension into Lothian itself, may well have taken place during the reign of the embattled and unpopular Eadwig, King of the English.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 35; Hudson (1994) pp. 89‚Äì90. Illulb's attack may be evidenced by passages preserved by the twelfth-century Prophecy of Berch√°n which not only note \\"woe\\" inflicted upon the Britons and English, but also the conquest of foreign territories by way of Scottish military might.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂¬∂ 35‚Äì36; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 29; Hudson (1998) p. 159 n. 57; Hudson (1996) pp. 48 ¬ß 160, 48 ¬ß 162, 88 ¬ß 160, 88 ¬ß 162, 88 n. 97; Hudson (1994) pp. 89‚Äì90; Anderson, AO (1930) pp. 46 ¬ß 158; 46‚Äì47 ¬ß 160; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 471; Skene (1867) p. 94. The notice of Britons in this text could be evidence that Illulb campaigned against Cumbrian-controlled territories.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂¬∂ 35‚Äì36; Hudson (1994) pp. 89‚Äì90. Such conflict may have meant that the apparent Cumbrian extension southwards was mirrored by movement eastwards. One possibility is that the Scots seized Edinburgh not from the English but from Cumbrians who had temporarily taken possession of it. Certainly, the fortress of Edinburgh had anciently been a British stronghold.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 36.

The latter's death at the hands of Britons in 971 is recorded by several sources. Some of these sources place his death in locations that could refer to either Abington in South Lanarkshire,Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 6; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 32; Hicks (2003) pp. 40‚Äì41; Macquarrie (1998) p. 16 n. 3; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 476 n. 2.

Cuil√©n mac Illuilb as it appears on folio 29v of Paris Biblioth√®que Nationale Latin 4126: \\". Although there is no specific evidence that Rhydderch was himself a king,Macquarrie (2004b); Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. the fact that Cuil√©n was involved with his daughter, coupled with the fact that his warband was evidently strong enough to overcome that of Cuil√©n, suggests that Rhydderch must have been a man of eminent standing.Macquarrie (2004b). According to the Prophecy of Berch√°n, Cuil√©n met his end whilst \\"seeking a foreign land\\", which could indicate that he was attempting to lift taxes from the Cumbrians.Hudson (1998) p. 160 n. 71; Macquarrie (1998) p. 16; Hudson (1996) pp. 49 ¬ß 168, 88 ¬ß 168; Hudson (1994) p. 93; Anderson, AO (1930) p. 48 ¬ß 166; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 477; Skene (1867) pp. 95‚Äì96. Another way in which Cuil√©n may have met his end concerns the record of his father's seizure of Edinburgh. The fact that this conquest would have likely included at least part of Lothian,Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂¬∂ 16‚Äì18, 24; Hudson (1998) pp. 151, 159; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 468; Skene (1867) p. 10. coupled with the evidence placing Cuil√©n's demise in the same area, could indicate that Cuil√©n was slain in the midst of exercising overlordship of this contested territory. If so, the records that link Rhydderch with the regicide could reveal that this wronged father exploited Cuil√©n's vulnerable position in the region, and that Rhydderch seized the chance to avenge his daughter.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 24.

Cuil√©n seems to have been succeeded by his kinsman Cin√°ed mac Ma√≠l Choluim.Broun (2004a); Broun (2004c). One of the latter's first acts as King of Alba was evidently an invasion of the kingdom of the Cumbrians.Williams (2014); Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 25; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 9 ¬∂ 30; Oram (2011) ch. 5; Woolf (2009) p. 259; Busse (2006a); Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35; Broun (2004c). This campaign could well have been a retaliatory response to Cuil√©n's killing,Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 25; Woolf (2009) p. 259. carried out in the context of crushing a British affront to Scottish authority.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 25. In any event, Cin√°ed's invasion ended in defeat,Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35; Broun (2004c). a fact which coupled with Cuil√©n's killing reveals that the Cumbrian realm was indeed a power to be reckoned with.McGuigan (2015b) p. 140; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35. Whilst it is conceivable that Rhydderch could have succeeded Dyfnwal by the time of Cuil√©n's fall,Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. another possibility is that Dyfnwal was still the king, and that Cin√°ed's strike into Cumbrian territory was the last conflict of Dyfnwal's reign.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35. In fact, it could have been at about this point when M√°el Coluim took up the kingship.Hicks (2003) p. 44 n. 107.

An early twentieth-century depiction of Edgar being rowed down the River Dee by eight kings.Cassell's History of England (1909) p. 53. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Edgar met six kings at Chester. By the twelfth century, chroniclers alleged that eight kings rowed Edgar down the river in an act of submission.Williams (2004a). One of these eight was Dyfnwal himself. Whilst the symbolic tale of the men rowing Edgar down the river may be an unhistorical embellishment, most of the names accorded to the eight kings can be associated with contemporary rulers, suggesting that some of these men may have taken part in a concord with him.Thornton (2001) p. 74. Although the latter accounts allege that the kings submitted to Edgar, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle merely states that they came to an agreement of cooperation with him, and thus became his (\\"co-workers\\", \\"even-workers\\", \\"fellow-workers\\").Davidson (2002) pp. 66‚Äì67, 140; Davidson (2001) p. 208; Thornton (2001) p. 77‚Äì78. One possibility is that the assembly somehow relates to Edmund's attested incursion into Cumbria in 945. According to the same source, when Edmund Cumbria to M√°el Coluim mac Domnaill, he had done so on the condition that the latter would be his (\\"co-worker\\", \\"even-worker\\", \\"fellow- worker\\", \\"together-wright\\").Hicks (2003) p. 16 n. 35; Davidson (2002) pp. 115‚Äì116, 140; Davidson (2001) p. 208; Thornton (2001) pp. 77‚Äì78; Whitelock (1996) p. 224; Anderson, AO (1908) p. 74; Thorpe (1861) pp. 212‚Äì213.

If this supposed grant formed a part of the episode at Chester, it along with the concord of 945 could indicate that the assembly of 975 was not a submission as such, but more of a conference concerning mutual cooperation along the English borderlands.Downham (2007) p. 125; Williams (2004a); Davidson (2002) p. 5; Thornton (2001) pp. 78‚Äì79. The location of the assembly of 973 at Chester would have been a logical neutral site for all parties.Barrow (2001) p. 89.

Considering the fact that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle numbers the kings at six, if Cin√°ed was indeed present, it is unlikely that his rival, Cuil√©n's brother Amla√≠b mac Illuilb, was also in attendance.Woolf (2007) p. 208.

These two Islesmen may have been regarded a threats by the Scots and Cumbrians. Maccus and Gofraid are recorded to have devastated Anglesey at the beginning of the decade,Gough-Cooper (2015b) p. 43 ¬ß b993.1; Williams (2014); Downham (2007) p. 190; Matthews (2007) pp. 9, 25; Woolf (2007) pp. 206‚Äì207; Davidson (2002) p. 151; Anderson, AO (1922) pp. 478‚Äì479 n. 6; Rh≈∑s (1890) p. 262; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 24‚Äì25. which could indicate that Edgar's assembly was undertaken as a means to counter the menace posed by these energetic insular Scandinavians.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 545; Downham (2007) pp. 222‚Äì223; Matthews (2007) pp. 9, 15; Woolf (2007) pp. 207‚Äì208. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that, as a consequence of the assembly at Chester, the brothers may have turned their attention from the British mainland westwards towards Ireland.Downham (2007) pp. 126‚Äì127, 222‚Äì223; Woolf (2007) p. 208. The name of Thored Gunnerson as it appears on folio 58v of British Library Cotton Domitian A VIII (the \\"F\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"\\".Baker (2000) p. 83; Cotton MS Domitian A VIII (n.d.). Another aspect of the assembly may have concerned the remarkable rising power of Amla√≠b C√∫ar√°n in Ireland.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 545; Davidson (2002) p. 147. Edgar may have wished to not only rein in men such as Maccus and Gofraid, but prevent them‚Äîand the Scots and Cumbrians‚Äîfrom affiliating themselves with Amla√≠b C√∫ar√°n, and recognising the latter's authority in the Irish Sea region.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 545. Another factor concerning Edgar, and his Scottish and Cumbrian counterparts, may have been the stability of the northern English frontier. For example, a certain Thored Gunnerson is recorded to have ravaged Westmorland in 966, an action that may have been undertaken by the English in the context of a response to Cumbrian southward expansion.Williams (2014); Williams (2004a); Whitelock (1996) p. 229; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 472; Thorpe (1861) p. 223. Although the Scottish invasion of Cumbrian and English territory unleashed after Cin√°ed's inauguration could have been intended to tackle Cumbrian opposition, another possibility is that the campaign may have been executed as a way to counter any occupation of Cumbrian territories by Thored.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 26.

According to various Irish annals, which style Dyfnwal King of the Britons, he met his end whilst undertaking a pilgrimage.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 975.2; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 975.3; Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 17, 7 n. 19; Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 36; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 41; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 975.2; Woolf (2007) p. 184; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 975.3; Broun (2004d) pp. 128‚Äì129; Macquarrie (2004b); Hicks (2003) p. 42; Davidson (2002) pp. 39, 146; Macquarrie (1998) pp. 15‚Äì16; Hudson (1994) p. 174 n. 8; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 480, 480 n. 7. These sources are corroborated by Welsh texts such as the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Brenhinedd y Saesson,Matthews (2007) p. 25; Jones; Williams; Pughe (1870) p. 658. and Brut y Tywysogyon, with the latter stating that Dyfnwal died in Rome having received the tonsure.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 17, 7 n. 19; Clancy (2002) p. 22; Macquarrie (1998) pp. 15‚Äì16; Hudson (1994) p. 174 n. 8; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 480; Rh≈∑s (1890) p. 262; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 26‚Äì27. Such religious retirement late in the life of a ruler was not uncommon amongst contemporaries. For example, Custant√≠n evidently became a monk upon his own abdication, whilst Amla√≠b C√∫ar√°n retired to the holy island of Iona in pilgrimage.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 17; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 27. One possibility is that Dyfnwal decided to undertake his religious journey‚Äîor was perhaps forced to undertake it‚Äîas a result of the violent actions of Rhydderch.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 36; Oram (2011) ch. 2. The title of Dyfnwal's son, M√°el Coluim, as it appears on folio 15v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"\\" (\\"king of the Britons of the north\\").The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 997.3; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 997.3; Bodleian Library MS.

It is conceivable that Dyfnwal was still reigning in 973,Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 30; Busse (2006c); Thornton (2001) p. 55. and that it was Edgar's death two years later that precipitated the transfer of the kingship to Dyfnwal's son M√°el Coluim, and contributed to Dyfnwal's pilgrimage to Rome. In fact, the upheaval caused by the absence of the English and Cumbrian kings could well have contributed to Cin√°ed's final elimination of Amla√≠b mac Illuilb in 997. Another possibility is that M√°el Coluim's part in the 973 assembly may have partly concerned his father's impending pilgrimage, and that he sought surety for Dyfnwal's safe passage through Edgar's realm. The fact that M√°el Coluim is identified as one of the assembled kings could indicate that Dyfnwal had relinquished control to him at some point before the convention.Williams (2014); Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 30; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 9 ¬∂ 29; Macquarrie (2004); Davidson (2002) p. 146; Williams; Smyth; Kirby (1991) p. 104.

If M√°el Coluim was indeed king in 973, Dyfnwal's role at the assembly may have been that of an 'elder statesman' of sorts‚Äîpossibly serving as an adviser or mentor‚Äîespecially considering his decades of experience in international affairs.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 12; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 9 ¬∂ 29; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35.

This source records the latter's death in 1015. Surviving sources fail to note the Cumbrian kingdom between the obituaries of Dyfnwal in 975 and his son, M√°el Coluim, in 997.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 41.

For instance, according to the \\"B\\" version of Annales Cambri√¶, a certain Owain‚Äîidentified as the son of a man named Dyfnwal‚Äîwas slain in 1015.Gough- Cooper (2015b) p. 46 ¬ß b1036.1; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 572 fig. 17.4; Woolf (2007) p. 236; Broun (2004d) p. 128, 128 n. 66; Hicks (2003) p. 43; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 550.

If the like-named men are indeed different people, they could well have been closely related. Whilst the former may have been a son of Dyfnwal himself, the latter could well have been a son of Dyfnwal's son, M√°el Coluim.Clarkson (2014) ch. genealogical tables; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 572 fig. 17.4; Clarkson (2010) ch. genealogical tables; Woolf (2007) pp. 236, 238 tab. 6.4; Broun (2004d) pp. 128 n. 66, 135 tab.; Hicks (2003) p. 44, 44 n. 107; Duncan (2002) pp. 29, 41. The Owain who died in 1015, therefore, would seem to have assumed the Cumbrian kingship after M√°el Coluim's death in 997, and would appear to have reigned into the early eleventh century before Owain Foel's assumption of the throne.

According to popular legend, a local king named Dunmail was slain by Saxons on the pass and buried beneath a cairn. Forms of this tradition may date to about the sixteenth century,Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂¬∂ 22‚Äì27. as the place name is first marked on a map dating to 1576.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 24; Hicks (2003) p. 43 n. 103. By the end of the seventeenth century, it was claimed that the place name marked the site of \\"a great heap of Stones call'd Dunmail-Raise-Stones, suppos'd to have been cast up by Dunmail K. of Cumberland for the Bounds of his Kingdom\\".Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 24; Ogilby (1699) p. 179. Forms of the tale began to appear in print in the following century. In time, the ever-evolving legend became associated with the events of 945.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¬∂ 24. The cairn itself lies between the dual carriageways of the A591 road.Pugmire (2004) pp. 112, 115 fig. 2; Winchester (2000) pp. 33‚Äì34. It seems to have marked an old boundary between Westmorland and Cumberland, and might have also marked the southern territorial extent of the Cumbrian kingdom.Winchester (2000) pp. 33‚Äì34. Nevertheless, the site's alleged importance in the early mediaeval period cannot be proven.Edmonds (2015) p. 54.

Its products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which involves the steps that create the active components of semiconductor devices (transistors, capacitors) and their wiring (interconnects). The company also builds equipment for back-end wafer-level packaging (WLP), and for related manufacturing markets such as for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Lam Research was founded in 1980 by Dr. David K. Lam and is headquartered in Fremont, California, in the Silicon Valley. As of 2018, it was the second largest manufacturer in the Bay Area, after Tesla. History Lam Research was founded in 1980 by David K. Lam, a Chinese-born engineer who had previously worked at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments. It was while he was at Hewlett Packard that he saw the need for better plasma etching equipment, to keep up with the rapid miniaturization of semiconductor wafers. He credited Bob Noyce, founder of Intel, for assisting him in getting funding by ensuring his business plan made sense. In 1981, the company introduced its first product, the AutoEtch 480, an automated polysilicon plasma etcher. The name AutoEtch was chosen to convey that the etcher was automated, while the 80 in 480 came from 1980, the year the company was founded. The first system was sold in January 1982. In 1982, Roger Emerick was appointed CEO. In May 1984, the company issued an IPO and was listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol LRCX. In 1985, David Lam left the company to join Link Technologies, which eventually was bought by Wyse and is now Dell Wyse. In the mid-1980s, Lam Research continued its global expansion, concentrating on Taiwan and also opening customer support centers throughout Europe, the United States and Japan. By the early 1990s, the company had a presence in China, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. In March 1997, the company purchased OnTrak Systems Inc., a chip equipment manufacturer that specialized in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) cleaning, for $225 Million. CMP cleaning is a hybrid process to smooth surfaces using both etching and mechanical polishing. In August 1997, the company named OnTrak's CEO Jim Bagley as its CEO. In 1998, Bagley was named chairman of the board. In 2005, Steve Newberry was appointed as CEO. In 2006, Lam Research acquired Bullen Semiconductor, now Silfex, Inc. In 2008, Lam Research acquired SEZ AG, now Lam Research AG. In 2011, Lam Research agreed to buy San Jose, California chip equipment manufacturer Novellus Systems, for $3.3B. The deal was completed in June 2012. In 2012, Martin Anstice was appointed as CEO. In October 2015, Lam Research announced plans to buy Milpitas, California-based wafer inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move. In June 2016, it was announced that Lam Research had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time. In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice over antitrust concerns. In September 2017, the company announced the acquisition of Cary, North Carolina- based chip simulation firm Coventor. The company's software reportedly would allow Lam to reduce the time to market for its new chips. In November, the company launched Lam Research Capital (Lam Capital), a venture capital group chartered to invest in companies. In January 2018, the company announced that COO Tim Archer was being promoted to president, and CEO Martin Anstice was remaining in the CEO role. In December 2018, Martin Anstice resigned as CEO due to allegations of personal misconduct and the Board of Directors of Lam Research named Tim Archer as president and chief executive officer.https://investor.lamresearch.com/news-releases/news-release- details/lam-research-corporation-announces-martin-anstice-resigns-chief Archer was also appointed to the Board of Directors of Lam Research. Prior to this appointment, Archer was the company's president and chief operating officer. Products Lam Research designs and builds products for semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning processes. Repeated throughout semiconductor manufacturing, these technologies help create transistors, interconnects, advanced memory, and packaging structures. They are also used for applications in related markets like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). =Thin film deposition= Lam's thin film deposition systems lay down the sub-microscopic layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials that make up an integrated circuit. The processes require uniformity at the nanoscale level. The company employs electrochemical deposition (ECD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies to form copper and other metal films for conducting structures. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is also used for tungsten metal films in features like contacts and plugs, which are vertical connections between metal lines in multilevel interconnect chip designs. Plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD and ALD technologies create dielectric films for a wide range of insulating parts. For gapfill processes, which require depositing dielectric material into narrow spaces, Lam uses high-density plasma (HDP) CVD technology. PECVD and ALD are also used to form hardmasks, layers which can be removed to improve circuit patterning processes. =Plasma etch= Lam Research uses proprietary technology in its equipment for plasma etch, the process of selectively removing materials from the surface of a wafer in order to create the semiconductor device's features and patterns. The equipment helps chip manufacturers carve small features such as those needed for the latest multiple patterning sequences, transistors, and advanced memory structures, which involve increasingly complex film stacks and ever higher aspect ratio structures. The company uses reactive ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to shape a variety of conductive and dielectric features. The company‚Äôs deep RIE technologies help create structures for applications like MEMS and through-silicon vias (TSVs). =Photoresist strip= Lam‚Äôs dry strip systems use plasma technology to selectively remove the photoresist mask following a range of front-end wafer processing and advanced packaging applications. =Wafer cleaning= Lam Research's wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues, and films from the wafer surface before or after adjacent processes. The company‚Äôs spin wet clean technology is used between chip-processing steps to remove yield-limiting residues and defects. Lam‚Äôs bevel clean technology directs a plasma at the very edge of the wafer to clean unwanted particles, residues, and films. If not removed, these materials can impact yield if they flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent manufacturing steps. Lam Capital The company's Lam Capital investment group invests in semiconductor-related businesses, including those in the fields of life sciences and industrial automation. Customers The company markets its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe and Asia. Facilities Lam has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Austria, and Korea and sales and services offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Early life Joe Gormley was born in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire in 1917, one of seven children, and became a miner at the age of fourteen. He was an active trade union official and became a committee member of the St Helens area branch of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in 1957. He served as general secretary of the North West region (comprising Lancashire and Cumberland) from April 1961 and joined the national executive in 1963. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year's Honours. He was a fan of Wigan rugby league football club.Collins, Tony. Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain (2006), p. 223 1970s In 1971, he was elected as leader of the NUM and presided over the national strike that began on 9 January 1972. The strike lasted for seven weeks and the Middle East oil crisis caused widespread power cuts. Emergency measures were used to economise on electricity by reducing the working week to three days. After much negotiation the strike was resolved on 25 February 1972 with a 21% increase in pay and concessions won by the miners. Miners moved to the top of the UK's industrial wage league, having previously been seventeenth. Only two years later, NUM members voted again to strike and stopped work on 4 February 1974. The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, called a snap election on this issue, asking the public, \\"Who governs Britain?\\" Gormley tried to persuade the National Executive Conference to postpone the strike until after any election, but the strike went ahead. After the election brought in a new Labour government, the union's demands were met. 1980s In 1981, the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, threatened to break with the 'Plan for Coal' and close 23 pits. A ballot for strike was held if the government closed pits contrary to the Plan for Coal. A strike mandate resulted with an 87.6% majority. The NUM Executive had a clear mandate for strike action if the government breached the Plan for Coal agreement. When a national strike was threatened, Thatcher backed down; many miners went on unofficial strike in the year, but Gormley rejected calls for a national strike. He left his post in 1982 and was replaced by the more left-wing Arthur Scargill. In 1982, his last-minute appeal got miners to accept a Government offer of a 9.3% raise, rejecting Scargill's call for a strike authorisation. When asked what he had achieved during his period as President, he replied, \\"Everyone wants to be related to a miner\\". One of Gormley's long-term legacies which affected the 1984‚Äì85 strike was his role in the wage reforms of 1977. The reforms paid miners a wage proportionate to the output of their region. This gave Nottinghamshire miners the highest wages of all and so they were very reluctant to go on strike in 1984, when few of their pits were under threat and those miners had high wages to lose. Another key matter was that two ballots of the NUM membership had rejected these reforms, and Gormley responded by declaring productivity schemes now to be for the regional committees to decide, with or without a regional ballot. When this was challenged in the High Court as a violation of union rules, the court upheld Gormley. This confusion over when the NUM needed to hold a ballot became of huge importance during the 1984-85 strike, when Scargill tried to mimic Gormley's methods and make a national strike into something on which regional committees could decide. He was made a life peer as Baron Gormley, of Ashton-in-Makerfield in Greater Manchester in the 1982 Birthday Honours. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1982 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Special Branch In 2002, the BBC uncovered that Gormley had worked for Special Branch by passing on information on extremism within his own union. A former Special Branch officer made this allegation and said that Gormley \\"loved his country. He was a patriot and he was very wary and worried about the growth of militancy within his own union\\". The BBC claimed, \\"Special Branch was talking to more than 20 senior trades union leaders during the early 1970s\\".

Life and career Harrington is the son of former State Senator, Salem mayor, and judge Joseph B. Harrington. Harrington graduated from St. John's Preparatory School, in Danvers, Massachusetts, in 1954, then earned a B.A. at Harvard University in 1958 and a J.D. at Harvard Law School in 1961. After serving on the Salem City Council from 1960 to 1963, Harrington was elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature in 1964, serving until 1969. On September 30, 1969, he won a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Representative William H. Bates. Harrington defeated Republican state Senator William L. Saltonstall with 52% of the vote. Running in opposition to the Vietnam War, he became the first Democrat to win the 6th Congressional district since 1875. He was subsequently re-elected to four full terms as a Congressman before retiring in 1978. On July 8, 1975, Rep. Harrington called on House Speaker Carl Albert to convene the Democratic party committee to examine a secrecy system which he said has covered up \\"grotesque violations of the law\\" abroad by the CIA. At a news conference the Massachusetts Democrat also released three other letters countering efforts in the House to censure him for his role in surfacing the disclosure in 1974 that the CIA spent 11 million dollars (1974 dollars not inflation adjusted) to influence the Chilean political situation. -(UPI- Washington, July 8, 1975). Following his retirement from Congress, he became a real estate developer. After a brief run for the Democratic nomination for Massachusetts State Treasurer in 1990, Harrington was charged in 2000 for making false statements to financial institutions, banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As a result, his law licence was suspended for three years and he was fined $100,000. Harrington is currently a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts.

The scale was first proposed by Sergei Medvedev (USSR), Wilhelm Sponheuer (East Germany), and V√≠t K√°rn√≠k (Czechoslovakia) in 1964. It was based on the experiences being available in the early 1960s from the application of the Modified Mercalli intensity scale and the 1953 version of the Medvedev scale, known also as the GEOFIAN scale. With minor modifications in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the MSK scale became widely used in Europe and the USSR. In early 1990s, the European Seismological Commission (ESC) used many of the principles formulated in the MSK in the development of the European Macroseismic Scale, which is now a de facto standard for evaluation of seismic intensity in European countries. MSK-64 is still being used in India, Israel, Russia, and throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Medvedev‚ÄìSponheuer‚ÄìKarnik scale is somewhat similar to the Modified Mercalli (MM) scale used in the United States. The MSK scale has 12 intensity degrees expressed in Roman numerals (to prevent the use of decimals): { style=\\"width:90%; border:1px solid grey; background:whitesmoke;\\" cellspacing=\\"8\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" - ! bgcolor=\\"white\\" align=\\"left\\" style=\\"width:200px\\"  I.

He served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1955 until his death in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1976. Biography Macdonald was born in Everett, Massachusetts, in 1917 and grew up in Malden. After several years in public school, he entered Phillips Academy in Andover. Macdonald attended Harvard University, where he was captain of the Crimson football team and the roommate of John F. Kennedy. They remained close friends throughout their lives, with Macdonald serving as an usher at then-Senator Kennedy's wedding and as an honorary pallbearer at President Kennedy's funeral. At Harvard, Macdonald earned his B.A. in 1940 and his LL.B. in 1946 from its law school. Macdonald served in the United States Navy as a PT boat commander in the Southwest Pacific theater from 1942 to 1944, and was awarded the Silver Star, Purple Heart and Presidential Unit Citation. He was admitted to the bar in 1946 and commenced the practice of law in Boston as a partner in the firm of Stoneman, Macdonald & Chandler. Macdonald was a member of the National Labor Relations Board for the New England area from 1948 to 1952, and he was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1960, 1964, and 1968. Macdonald was elected as a Democrat to the 84th Congress in 1954. During his career, he served as majority Whip, and as ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. He was often referred to as the \\"Father of Public Broadcasting\\", since he was one of the legislators primarily responsible for Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. He was also responsible for the \\"sports blackout bill\\" which provides for the broadcast of local sold-out sporting contests. Another focus was his effort to reform campaign broadcasting practices, addressing his concern that competent candidates were being priced out of the process, and others were buying their way in. While recognized as an active legislator, he was also justly noted for his high level of service to individual constituents and their problems. His sharp wit and sense of humor garnered him among his Congressional colleagues the nickname \\"The Needle\\". He was reelected ten times, and died in office on May 21, 1976,Rep. Macdonald, 58, Dies; Led Election Law Reform in Bethesda, Maryland. =Personal life= Macdonald married actress Phyllis Brooks on June 23, 1945, in Tarrytown, New York. They remained married until his death. They had four children, the eldest of whom was President Kennedy's godson. Macdonald was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts. He was portrayed by actor Stan Cahill in the 1993 television miniseries JFK: Reckless Youth.

Founded in 1905 by the Ursuline Sisters, Ursuline was an all-women's academy until 1930. History Around the start of the 20th century, Ursuline High School began service to the ministry of Catholic Education as a simple day school for girls on West Rayen Avenue. With an initial enrollment of 25 girls, the Ursuline Academy of the Holy Name of Jesus was founded, the predecessor of today‚Äôs Ursuline High School. The original curriculum stressed classical studies, language skills, doctrinal religion and strict discipline. In the years following World War I, Youngstown, Ohio witnessed an unmatched period of growth and prosperity. Likewise, the Academy flourished and outgrew its Rayen Avenue convent building. The Chauncey Andrews Estate was purchased in February 1919, thus beginning the ‚ÄúWick Avenue Era,‚Äù reflective of Ursuline's current home on Wick Avenue on the north side of Youngstown. The Ursulines began a fundraising drive almost immediately upon moving into the Andrews Estate to build a new school that could accommodate 400 students. Groundbreaking was held in 1924, and in April 1925 the student body moved into a three-story brick building on Bryson Street. The school became coeducational, admitting male students as the school's population increased. Academics The instructional program at Ursuline High School is designed for the college- bound student but is flexible enough to meet the needs of most students. Ursuline offers Honors and Advanced Placement sections in English, French, Spanish, American History, American Government, science and mathematics to challenge students who are gifted in those particular areas. Athletics Ursuline High School has participated in high school athletics and has been a member of the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) for many years. Currently, Ursuline fields 17 varsity teams for both boys and girls and celebrates a long-standing athletic rivalry with Cardinal Mooney High School, another Diocese of Youngstown high school located on Youngstown's south side. ;Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships * Baseball‚Äî1988, 2000 * Football‚Äî2000, 2008, 2009, 2010 * Boys Golf‚Äî1975, 1976 * Boys Basketball‚Äî1994 * Girls Basketball‚Äî2004 Notable alumni *Pat Bilon, actor *Mike Echols, former National Football League player *Bob Hagan, American politician *Tim Hagan, American politician *Paul Maguire, former American Football League player, TV sportscaster *Ed O'Neill, actor *Darrell K.

Biography Garden was born in Charleston, the son of the naturalist Dr. Alexander Garden and his wife, Elizabeth. He went to Westminster School in London and got his MA degree at the University of Glasgow in Scotland in 1779. In 1780 Garden returned to America to join the Patriot cause. His father, a Loyalist who had been compelled to flee South Carolina and find refuge in London, never forgave his son. Garden joined the Continental Army and served as a cornet in Lee's Legion under \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee. In 1781 he was promoted to major and served for the remainder of the war as an aide-de-camp to General Nathanael Greene. After the war, he was granted the right to his family's property, which like other Loyalist property in the South had been confiscated by the state government. He married Mary Anna Gibbes; the couple had no children, but they adopted her nephew, who took Garden's name and became his heir. Garden was elected to the South Carolina General Assembly in 1784 and served one term. He was an officer of the South Carolina Society of the Cincinnati. He and other members of the Society tried to end the practice of duelling in South Carolina. He wrote several valuable, though admittedly didactic, works on the Revolution.

While Felona is shiny and flourishing, Sorona is dark and home to plagues and catastrophes: however, in the second part of the suite, the fate of the two planets is inverted. Apart from two acoustic interludes, the music is mainly keyboard- and synth-driven, producing gloomy and spacey effects, especially in the opening \\"Sospesi nell'incredibile\\" and in the instrumental ending piece, \\"Ritorno al nulla\\" (\\"Return to Naught\\").

Mute Records released the single in the UK under the title Moon & the Sky Plus, a similar tactic used for one of Erasure's previous singles (\\"Rain\\"). The song was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell and is an uptempo, electronic dance track. In its album version the song has a harsher, more techno-influenced feel. Maverick Records, Erasure's U.S. record label at the time, requested the single remixes but ended up passing on the Loveboat album altogether and releasing Erasure from their contract, leaving Mute records to release the U.S. version of Loveboat in 2003.

Asamblea Nacional Televisi√≥n (ANTV) is the television station of the National Assembly of Venezuela. It was created in 2005 to cover the proceedings of Venezuela's National Assembly. Their goal is to increase the participation of Venezuelan citizens in the legislative debates. The signal is seen by those with a cable or satellite subscription in Venezuela, under the name Fundaci√≥n Audiovisual Nacional de Televisi√≥n, that it's not the current National Assembly channel; therefore, the Assembly broadcasts their sessions in a YouTube channel also called ANTV. History The now ex-president of the National Assembly of Venezuela, Nicol√°s Maduro, claims that it was his idea to create ANTV since he was first elected to his position. The Grupo de Boston, a group integrated by Venezuelan and American Congresspeoples, proposed the creation of ANTV in 2003. Afterward, the topic was analyzed by a consensus between supporters and opponents of President Hugo Ch√°vez. The United States Congress offered to support the proposal with equipment, but that never happened. Due to many debates and arguments in the Venezuelan National Assembly, the approval for the creation of ANTV took over a year. It began broadcasting February 17, 2005. ANTV is a non-profit organization, whose resources come from the Legislative branch of Venezuela and national and international donations. Maduro claims that the objectives of this channel are to develop the basic requirements of the Constitution. \\"It's at the service to promote new democratic values in Venezuela and to build a new era of participation by the citizens. Revolution is when people are well informed, come up with their own conclusions, and participate in the political life of the country\\". The two goals of Nicol√°s Maduro for ANTV was to be an over-the-air television network and for people to interact with it. Since last quarter of 2006 it started broadcasting in Caracas on UHF channel 62. In the first semester of 2005, CONATEL gave the approval for ANTV to be seen without the necessity of it being affiliated with DirecTV, NetUno, Supercable and Intercable. Maduro also hopes that an interactive forum is set up, so that citizens finally can make their recommendations on any proposed law over the internet or by telephone; it is considered that technological advances will help in this area. Since 2010 until January 2016, it was the only television channel autorised to broadcast the National Assembly sessions. The other media had to connect with ANTV in case of a simulcast. =Liquidation= On December 8, 2015, then- President of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, reported that the ANTV signal concession would be given to the channel's workers. On December 10, 2015, it was approved by the deputies of the PSUV the transfer of ANTV and AN Radio (its sister radio station) to their employees. On that day they also approved 400 million bol√≠vares for the operation of the television and radio of the National Assembly for 2016. The change of administration was generated as a consequence of the results of the parliamentary elections in Venezuela in 2015 and statements of deputy Henry Ramos Allup. However, some experts say that besides confusing, the transfer is illegal. On December 31, 2015 it was reported that the channel would change its name to National Audiovisual Television Foundation ANTV (Fundaci√≥n Audiovisual Nacional de Televisi√≥n ANTV). According to Deputy Dar√≠o Vivas, the new channel would serve to \\"see content, truthfulness and good information\\". The channel workers assume operational and administrative functions of the channel from January 1, 2016. On December 31, 2015, the channel stopped broadcasting signal itself instead to repeat the signal of Venezolana de Televisi√≥n. On January 4, 2016 there were complaints from several employees of mass layoffs channel and loss of equipment. The ANTV Foundation has argued that no layoffs had happened because the former ANTV was liquidated and the new channel had not yet begun. ANTV Foundation also has denied the theft of equipment. =Substitution= On January 15, 2016, the signal of Audiovisual Foundation National Television ANTV channel began the broadcasts that replaced Asamblea Nacional Televisi√≥n. Also, on February 2, 2016, a version of ANTV was launched with the official beginning of the National Assembly sessions; this would be broadcast via streaming through YouTube, but would not be (so far) a television channel.

The Commission was formed to carry out diagnostic studies on corruption in the country as part of the Tanzanian Government strategy in enhancing integrity and accountability. It completed its work on 7 December 1996 after reviewing statutes, rules and procedures in Government and identifying loopholes for growth of corruption. The findings were published in \\"The Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Against Corruption\\", commonly known as \\"The Warioba Report\\". Amongst other things, the Commission found that in the social services delivery sector, some public servants receive bribes as a means of supplementing their meager incomes, which in turn helped them to meet their financial obligations (petty corruption). The other type of corruption highlighted was \\"grand corruption\\", which involves high- level official and public servants who engage in corrupt practices because of their excessive greed for accumulation of wealth. To remedy the problem of corruption, the Commission made comprehensive recommendations touching all government ministries and departments.

The term often connotes an attempt to impress others; it is usually regarded negatively, and under certain circumstances may constitute a breach of professional ethics.. When used as part of a logical argument it can be an example of the false authority fallacy.. Purposes Name-dropping is used to position oneself within a social hierarchy. It is often used to create a sense of superiority by raising one's status. By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise their own social status to a level closer to that of those whose names they have dropped, and thus elevate themselves above, or into, present company. Name-dropping can also be used to identify people with a common bond. By indicating the names of people one knows, one makes known their social circle, providing an opportunity for others with similar connections to relate.. As a form of appeal to authority, name-dropping can be an important form of informal argumentation, as long as the name being dropped is of someone who is an expert on the subject of the argument and that person's views are accurately represented. Methods Use of the first name may be effective, as in the case of \\"Kingsley\\" for Kingsley Amis.Joseph Epstein, \\"A Nice Little Knack for Name Dropping\\" in Narcissus Leaves the Pool, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 80ff.

While Old St Mellons is one of the original villages in the area, Pontprennau is a new development of housing and shops. Pontprennau & Old St Mellons has a population that probably now exceeds 10,000 people (8,037 from Census data, 2001 and 9,720 in 2011) due to sustained housebuilding in the Pontprennau section of the division, which is likely to continue for the next 10 years as a major urban expansion of up to 4,000 homes is constructed. It is bounded by Caerphilly county borough to the north; and by the wards of Trowbridge to the southeast; Llanrumney and Pentwyn to the south; and Lisvane to the west. Governance The electoral ward falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff North. Cardiff North has been represented by the Conservative Party since 2010.

Terminology Both XANES and NEXAFS are acceptable terms for the same technique. XANES name was invented in 1980 by Antonio Bianconi to indicate strong absorption peaks in X-ray absorption spectra in condensed matter due to multiple scattering resonances above the ionization energy. The name NEXAFS was introduced in 1983 by Jo Stohr and is synonymous with XANES, but is generally used when applied to surface and molecular science. Theory 341x341px The fundamental phenomenon underlying XANES is the absorption of an x-ray photon by condensed matter with the formation of many body excited states characterized by a core hole in a selected atomic core level. (see the first Figure). In the single particle theory approximation, the system is separated into one electron in the core levels of the selected atomic species of the system and N-1 passive electrons. In this approximation the final state is described by a core hole in the atomic core level and an excited photoelectron. The final state has a very short life time because of the short life-time of the core hole and the short mean free path of the excited photoelectron with kinetic energy in the range around 20-50 eV. The core hole is filled either via an Auger process or by capture of an electron from another shell followed by emission of a fluorescent photon. The difference between NEXAFS and traditional photoemission experiments is that in photoemission, the initial photoelectron itself is measured, while in NEXAFS the fluorescent photon or Auger electron or an inelastically scattered photoelectron may also be measured. The distinction sounds trivial but is actually significant: in photoemission the final state of the emitted electron captured in the detector must be an extended, free-electron state. By contrast in NEXAFS the final state of the photoelectron may be a bound state such as an exciton since the photoelectron itself need not be detected. The effect of measuring fluorescent photons, Auger electrons, and directly emitted electrons is to sum over all possible final states of the photoelectrons, meaning that what NEXAFS measures is the total joint density of states of the initial core level with all final states, consistent with conservation rules. The distinction is critical because in spectroscopy final states are more susceptible to many-body effects than initial states, meaning that NEXAFS spectra are more easily calculable than photoemission spectra. Due to the summation over final states, various sum rules are helpful in the interpretation of NEXAFS spectra. When the x-ray photon energy resonantly connects a core level with a narrow final state in a solid, such as an exciton, readily identifiable characteristic peaks will appear in the spectrum. These narrow characteristic spectral peaks give the NEXAFS technique a lot of its analytical power as illustrated by the B 1s œÄ* exciton shown in the second Figure. Synchrotron radiation has a natural polarization that can be utilized to great advantage in NEXAFS studies. The commonly studied molecular adsorbates have sigma and pi bonds that may have a particular orientation on a surface. The angle dependence of the x-ray absorption tracks the orientation of resonant bonds due to dipole selection rules. Experimental considerations Normal-incidence boron 1s x-ray absorption spectra for two types of BN powder. The cubic phase shows only œÉ-bonding while the hexagonal phase shows both œÄ and œÉ bonding. Soft x-ray absorption spectra are usually measured either through the fluorescent yield, in which emitted photons are monitored, or total electron yield, in which the sample is connected to ground through an ammeter and the neutralization current is monitored. Because NEXAFS measurements require an intense tunable source of soft x-rays, they are performed at synchrotrons. Because soft x-rays are absorbed by air, the synchrotron radiation travels from the ring in an evacuated beam-line to the end-station where the specimen to be studied is mounted. Specialized beam-lines intended for NEXAFS studies often have additional capabilities such as heating a sample or exposing it to a dose of reactive gas. Energy range =Edge energy range= In the absorption edge region of metals, the photoelectron is excited to the first unoccupied level above the Fermi level. Therefore, its mean free path in a pure single crystal at zero temperature is as large as infinite, and it remains very large, increasing the energy of the final state up to about 5 eV above the Fermi level. Beyond the role of the unoccupied density of states and matrix elements in single electron excitations, many-body effects appear as an \\"infrared singularity\\" at the absorption threshold in metals. In the absorption edge region of insulators the photoelectron is excited to the first unoccupied level above the chemical potential but the unscreened core hole forms a localized bound state called core exciton. =EXAFS energy range= Pictorial view of photoelectron scattering processes in the single-scattering regime, EXAFS (this assumes the single scattering approximation... multiple scattering can be considered with EXAFS), and in the multiple scattering regime, XANES. In EXAFS the photoelectron is scattered only by a single neighbour atom, in XANES all the scattering pathways, classified according to the number of scattering event (3), (4), (5) etc. contribute to the absorption cross section. The fine structure in the x-ray absorption spectra in the high energy range extending from about 150 eV beyond the ionization potential is a powerful tool to determine the atomic pair distribution (i.e. interatomic distances) with a time scale of about 10‚àí15 s. In fact the final state of the excited photoelectron in the high kinetic energy range (150-2000 eV ) is determined only by single backscattering events due to the low amplitude photoelectron scattering. =NEXAFS energy range= In the NEXAFS region, starting about 5 eV beyond the absorption threshold, because of the low kinetic energy range (5-150 eV) the photoelectron backscattering amplitude by neighbor atoms is very large so that multiple scattering events become dominant in the NEXAFS spectra. The different energy range between NEXAFS and EXAFS can be also explained in a very simple manner by the comparison between the photoelectron wavelength \\\\lambda and the interatomic distance of the photoabsorber-backscatterer pair. The photoelectron kinetic energy is connected with the wavelength \\\\lambda by the following relation: :E_\\\\text{kinetic} = h u - E_\\\\text{binding} = \\\\hbar^2 k^2/(2m) = (2\\\\pi)^2 \\\\hbar^2/(2m\\\\lambda^2), which means that for high energy the wavelength is shorter than interatomic distances and hence the NEXAFS region corresponds to a single scattering regime; while for lower E, \\\\lambda is larger than interatomic distances and the XANES region is associated with a multiple scattering regime. Final states The absorption peaks of NEXAFS spectra are determined by multiple scattering resonances of the photoelectron excited at the atomic absorption site and scattered by neighbor atoms. The local character of the final states is determined by the short photoelectron mean free path, that is strongly reduced (down to about 0.3 nm at 50 eV) in this energy range because of inelastic scattering of the photoelectron by electron- hole excitations (excitons) and collective electronic oscillations of the valence electrons called plasmons. Applications The great power of NEXAFS derives from its elemental specificity. Because the various elements have different core level energies, NEXAFS permits extraction of the signal from a surface monolayer or even a single buried layer in the presence of a huge background signal. Buried layers are very important in engineering applications, such as magnetic recording media buried beneath a surface lubricant or dopants below an electrode in an integrated circuit. Because NEXAFS can also determine the chemical state of elements which are present in bulk in minute quantities, it has found widespread use in environmental chemistry and geochemistry. The ability of NEXAFS to study buried atoms is due to its integration over all final states including inelastically scattered electrons, as opposed to photoemission and Auger spectroscopy, which study atoms only with a layer or two of the surface. Much chemical information can be extracted from the NEXAFS region: formal valence (very difficult to experimentally determine in a nondestructive way); coordination environment (e.g., octahedral, tetrahedral coordination) and subtle geometrical distortions of it. Transitions to bound vacant states just above the Fermi level can be seen. Thus NEXAFS spectra can be used as a probe of the unoccupied band structure of a material. The near-edge structure is characteristic of an environment and valence state hence one of its more common uses is in fingerprinting: if you have a mixture of sites/compounds in a sample you can fit the measured spectra with a linear combinations of NEXAFS spectra of known species and determine the proportion of each site/compound in the sample. One example of such a use is the determination of the oxidation state of the plutonium in the soil at Rocky Flats. The XANES experiments done on plutonium in soil, concrete and standards of the different oxidation states. History The acronym XANES was first used in 1980 during interpretation of multiple scattering resonances spectra measured at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) by A. Bianconi. In 1982 the first paper on the application of XANES for determination of local structural geometrical distortions using multiple scattering theory was published by A. Bianconi, P. J. Durham and J. B. Pendry. In 1983 the first NEXAFS paper examining molecules adsorbed on surfaces appeared. The first XAFS paper, describing the intermediate region between EXAFS and XANES, appeared in 1987.

Rise to power From 1743 to 1747, Ali-qoli khan commanded Nader's troops against the Yazidis of Kurdistan, the Karakalpaks and Uzbeks of Khwarazm and in Sistan. He then ran in trouble with his uncle over the latter's decision to levy 100,000 tomans on him combined with Nader's suspiciousness. In April 1747, in conjunction with the rebels of Sistan, Ali-qoli khan occupied Herat and induced the Kurds to enter into a rebellion. Nader, while marching against the insurgents, was murdered by a group of his officers, who then offered the crown to Ali-qoli. On arriving at Mashad, Ali-qoli sent a loyal force to the fortress of Kalat, where they killed all of Nader's issue with the exception of his 14-year-old grandson Shahrokh Mirza. On 6 July 1747, he was declared the shah under the name of Adel-Shah, \\"the just king\\". He sent his brother Ebrahim Mirza as a governor to Isfahan, while he remained in Mashad with his unpopular Georgian favourite, Sohrab Khan. Later that year, he defeated his erstwhile Kurdish allies, who had refused to supply grain for his famine-stricken army and capital, and had several of his supporters put to death on suspicion of conspiracy. He then marched against Mazandaran in a futile attempt to bend the Qajar tribe into submission. The Qajar chief Mohammad Hasan Khan was fled and his four-year-old son, the future Agha Mohammad Khan, was captured and castrated on Adel's orders.Richard Tapper, Frontier Nomads of Iran: A Political and Social History of the Shahsevan (Cambridge University Press, 1997: ), p. 118. (Mohammad Hasan Khan wasn't killed by Adel-Shah, he was killed later in 1759) Overthrow and death In the meantime, Ebrahim Mirza, who had consolidated his hold over western Iran, rose in rebellion against his reigning brother. He murdered Adel's favourite Sohrab Khan and in, June 1748, he marched to join his forces with Amir Aslan Khan, the sardar of Azerbaijan against Adel. The latter, at the head of a numerically superior army, advanced from Gilan to prevent the rebel forces combining, but the defection of many of his commanders precipitated his complete defeat. Adel fled to Tehran, but a local governor surrendered Adel to Ebrahim, who had him blinded. Six months later, Ebrahim was proclaimed shah, but his reign was quickly terminated by a coup which brought Nadir's surviving grandson Shahrokh Mirza to the throne. Ebrahim was blinded and soon died, while Adel was sent in chains to Mashad, where he was tortured to death.

It is a fairly common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and fairy rings in pastures and occasionally in woodland. Globally, it is widespread in temperate regions. Taxonomy The fungus was first described in 1772 by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, who named it Agaricus procerus. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Macrolepiota in 1948. Description The height and cap diameter of a mature specimen may both reach 30 - 40 (50) cm. The stipe is relatively thin and reaches full height before the cap has expanded. The stipe is very fibrous in texture which renders it inedible. The surface is characteristically wrapped in a snakeskin-like pattern of scaly growths (therefore, known in some parts of Europe as the \\"snake's hat\\" or \\"snake's sponge\\"). The immature cap is compact and egg-shaped, with the cap margin around the stipe, sealing a chamber inside the cap. As it matures, the margin breaks off, leaving a fleshy, movable ring around the stipe. At full maturity, the cap is more or less flat, with a chocolate-brown umbo in the centre that is leathery to touch. Dark and cap-coloured flakes remain on the upper surface of the cap and can be removed easily. The gills are crowded, free, and white with a pale pink tinge sometimes present. The spore print is white. It has a pleasant nutty smell. When sliced, the white flesh may turn a pale pink. Uses This edible mushroom is a very sought-after and popular fungus in Europe, due in part to its large size, seasonal frequency and versatility in the kitchen. In the UK, it may be found from July through to November. The parasol mushroom is difficult to mistake for any other, especially in regions like Europe where the poisonous look-alike Chlorophyllum molybdites is rare. Nevertheless, as with picking any fungus for consumption, caution should be exercised at all times. Macrolepiota procera is also edible raw, though its close lookalikes in the genus Chlorophyllum are toxic raw. These mushrooms are popularly sauteed in melted butter. In central and eastern European countries this mushroom is usually prepared similarly to a cutlet. It is usually run through egg and breadcrumbs and then fried in a pan with some oil or butter. A savory Slovak recipe is to bake caps stuffed with ground pork, oregano, and garlic. Italians and Austrians also serve the young, still spherical caps stuffed with seasoned minced beef, baked in the same manner as stuffed peppers. Similar species Macrolepiota procera, the parasol mushroom Smaller but similar in appearance is the common shaggy parasol (Chlorophyllum rhacodes.) Its edibility is suspect as it causes mild sickness in some people, especially when eaten raw. One must learn to distinguish the two as their geographical ranges overlap. Differences from the parasol mushroom include its smaller dimensions, pungent (fruity) and reddening flesh when cut, lack of patterns on its stipe, and very shaggy cap surface. Macrolepiota mastoidea, a European species, is yet another very large edible mushroom. Its dimensions are generally smaller than that of M. procera and the markings on its stipe less obvious. It is also much rarer. Species of Agaricus have brown spores and the gills of mature specimens are never white. There are a few poisonous species which can be mistaken for M. procera. *Chlorophyllum molybdites, a species that causes the largest number of annual mushroom poisonings in North America due to its close similarity. Faintly green gills and a pale green spore print give it away. Furthermore, this mushroom lacks the aforementioned snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the parasol mushroom. Its range is reportedly expanding into Europe.Macrolepiota rhacodes and Chlorophyllum molybdites poisoningLoizides M, Kyriakou T, Tziakouris A. (2011). Edible & Toxic Fungi of Cyprus (in Greek and English). Published by the authors. pp. 132‚Äì33. . *Leucocoprinus brunnea, also found in North America, slowly turns brown when sliced. *White and immature species of Amanita are also a potential hazard. To be sure, one must only pick parasol mushrooms past their button stage. A general rule of thumb with the parasol mushroom as compared to amanita species is that the parasol mushroom has darker flakes on a lighter surface, whereas amanita species have the opposite, lighter flakes (if there are any) on a darker surface, such as the Panther cap. *The Saffron Parasol Cystoderma amianthinum is very much smaller, and not often eaten. *Lepiota brunneoincarnata is a lepiota species known to have caused mortal intoxications in Spain. It is much smaller than Macrolepiota procera.

Multi-colored vertices are cut vertices, and thus belong to multiple biconnected components. In graph theory, a biconnected component (sometimes known as a 2-connected component) is a maximal biconnected subgraph. Any connected graph decomposes into a tree of biconnected components called the block-cut tree of the graph. The blocks are attached to each other at shared vertices called cut vertices or articulation points. Specifically, a cut vertex is any vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.  Algorithms  =Linear time depth first search= The classic sequential algorithm for computing biconnected components in a connected undirected graph is due to John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan (1973). It runs in linear time, and is based on depth-first search. This algorithm is also outlined as Problem 22-2 of Introduction to Algorithms (both 2nd and 3rd editions). The idea is to run a depth-first search while maintaining the following information: # the depth of each vertex in the depth-first-search tree (once it gets visited), and # for each vertex v, the lowest depth of neighbors of all descendants of v (including v itself) in the depth-first-search tree, called the lowpoint. The depth is standard to maintain during a depth-first search. The lowpoint of v can be computed after visiting all descendants of v (i.e., just before v gets popped off the depth- first-search stack) as the minimum of the depth of v, the depth of all neighbors of v (other than the parent of v in the depth-first-search tree) and the lowpoint of all children of v in the depth-first-search tree. The key fact is that a nonroot vertex v is a cut vertex (or articulation point) separating two biconnected components if and only if there is a child y of v such that lowpoint(y) ‚â• depth(v). This property can be tested once the depth-first search returned from every child of v (i.e., just before v gets popped off the depth-first-search stack), and if true, v separates the graph into different biconnected components. This can be represented by computing one biconnected component out of every such y (a component which contains y will contain the subtree of y, plus v), and then erasing the subtree of y from the tree. The root vertex must be handled separately: it is a cut vertex if and only if it has at least two children. Thus, it suffices to simply build one component out of each child subtree of the root (including the root). =Pseudocode= GetArticulationPoints(i, d) visited[i] := true depth[i] := d low[i] := d childCount := 0 isArticulation := false for each ni in adj[i] do if not visited[ni] then parent[ni] := i GetArticulationPoints(ni, d + 1) childCount := childCount + 1 if low[ni] ‚â• depth[i] then isArticulation := true low[i] := Min (low[i], low[ni]) else if ni ‚â† parent[i] then low[i] := Min (low[i], depth[ni]) if (parent[i] ‚â† null and isArticulation) or (parent[i] = null and childCount > 1) then Output i as articulation point Note that the terms child and parent denote the relations in the DFS tree, not the original graph. A demo of Tarjan's algorithm to find cut vertices. D denotes depth and L denotes lowpoint. = Other algorithms = A simple alternative to the above algorithm uses chain decompositions, which are special ear decompositions depending on DFS- trees.. Chain decompositions can be computed in linear time by this traversing rule. Let C be a chain decomposition of G. Then G is 2-vertex-connected if and only if G has minimum degree 2 and C1 is the only cycle in C. This gives immediately a linear-time 2-connectivity test and can be extended to list all cut vertices of G in linear time using the following statement: A vertex v in a connected graph G (with minimum degree 2) is a cut vertex if and only if v is incident to a bridge or v is the first vertex of a cycle in C - C1. The list of cut vertices can be used to create the block-cut tree of G in linear time. In the online version of the problem, vertices and edges are added (but not removed) dynamically, and a data structure must maintain the biconnected components. Jeffery Westbrook and Robert Tarjan (1992) developed an efficient data structure for this problem based on disjoint-set data structures. Specifically, it processes n vertex additions and m edge additions in O(m Œ±(m, n)) total time, where Œ± is the inverse Ackermann function. This time bound is proved to be optimal. Uzi Vishkin and Robert Tarjan (1985) designed a parallel algorithm on CRCW PRAM that runs in O(log n) time with n + m processors. Guojing Cong and David A. Bader (2005) developed an algorithm that achieves a speedup of 5 with 12 processors on SMPs. Speedups exceeding 30 based on the original Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm were reported by James A. Edwards and Uzi Vishkin (2012). Related structures = Equivalence relation = One can define a binary relation on the edges of an arbitrary undirected graph, according to which two edges e and f are related if and only if either e = f or the graph contains a simple cycle through both e and f. Every edge is related to itself, and an edge e is related to another edge f if and only if f is related in the same way to e. Less obviously, this is a transitive relation: if there exists a simple cycle containing edges e and f, and another simple cycle containing edges f and g, then one can combine these two cycles to find a simple cycle through e and g. Therefore, this is an equivalence relation, and it can be used to partition the edges into equivalence classes, subsets of edges with the property that two edges are related to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class. The subgraphs formed by the edges in each equivalence class are the biconnected components of the given graph. Thus, the biconnected components partition the edges of the graph; however, they may share vertices with each other. credit the definition of this equivalence relation to ; however, Harary does not appear to describe it in explicit terms. =Block graph= The block graph of a given graph G is the intersection graph of its blocks. Thus, it has one vertex for each block of G, and an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding two blocks share a vertex. A graph H is the block graph of another graph G exactly when all the blocks of H are complete subgraphs. The graphs H with this property are known as the block graphs.. =Block-cut tree= A cutpoint, cut vertex, or articulation point of a graph G is a vertex that is shared by two or more blocks. The structure of the blocks and cutpoints of a connected graph can be described by a tree called the block-cut tree or BC-tree. This tree has a vertex for each block and for each articulation point of the given graph. There is an edge in the block-cut tree for each pair of a block and an articulation point that belongs to that block., p. 36. A graph, and its block-cut tree. The blocks are: b1=[1,2], b2=[2,3,4], b3=[2,5,6,7], b4=[7,8,9,10,11], b5=[8,12,13,14,15], b6=[10,16] and b7=[10,17,18]; cutpoints are: c1=2, c2=7, c3=8 and c4=10.

Process The tape-automated bonding process places bare integrated circuits onto a printed circuit board. The mounting is done such that the bonding sites of the die, usually in the form of bumps or balls made of gold or solder, are connected to fine conductors on the tape, which provide the means of connecting the die to the package or directly to external circuits. Sometimes the tape on which the die is bonded already contains the actual application circuit of the die.TAB at Silicon Far East on-line. The film is moved to the target location, and the leads are cut and soldered as necessary. The bare chip may then be encapsulated (\\"glob topped\\") with epoxy or plastic. Standards Standard sizes for polyimide tapes include widths of 35 mm, 45 mm, and 70 mm and thicknesses between 50 and 100 micrometers. Since the tape is in the form of a roll, the length of the circuit is measured in terms of sprocket pitches, with each sprocket pitch measuring about 4.75 mm. Thus, a circuit size of 16 pitches is about 76 mm long. History and background The process was invented by Frances Hugle. Historically, TAB was created as an alternative to wire bonding and finds common use by manufacturers in LCD display driver circuits.

He last played for HC Pustertal-Val Pusteria in Italy's Serie A. He helped lead the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL) to a Memorial Cup championship in 2004. Playing career Guard was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. He spent his entire junior career with the WHL's Kelowna Rockets. In 2002‚Äì03, his first of two seasons with the team, he led the Rockets to a WHL Championship and a berth in the Memorial Cup tournament in Quebec City. The Rockets lost 2‚Äì1 to the Hull Olympiques in the semi-final. Guard had another stellar season with the Rockets in 2003‚Äì04, posting 44 wins in 62 games. Although Kelowna lost in the third round of the WHL playoffs that season, the city was chosen to host the 2004 Memorial Cup and as such the Rockets received an automatic berth in the tournament. Guard helped lead the team to the franchise's first Memorial Cup Championship as they defeated the Gatineau Olympiques 2‚Äì1 in the final. For his efforts, Guard was awarded both the Hap Emms Memorial Trophy and the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the Memorial Cup's top goaltender and most valuable player, respectively. He was also named to the tournament's First All-Star Team, and to the WHL's First All-Star Team for that season. In all, Guard posted an 83-24 record over his two seasons with Kelowna. Guard was never selected in the NHL Entry Draft but was signed to a professional contract by the National Hockey League's Ottawa Senators in 2004. He made his professional debut during the 2004‚Äì05 season playing for Ottawa's ECHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers. He spent the following two seasons with Ottawa's top minor league affiliate, the Binghamton Senators of the American Hockey League. He struggled with the team, posting a 36-44-4 record. The Senators opted not to offer Guard a new contract after the 2006-07 season and the goaltender became a free agent. In November 2007, Guard signed with the China Sharks of Asia League Ice Hockey, though his stint with the team was brief. He had similarly brief stints with the Vienna Capitals of Erste Bank Eishockey Liga and Junost Minsk of the Belarusian Extraleague before signing with Serie A's HC Pustertal-Val Pusteria. After sustaining a groin injury in an October 2008 match, Guard's contract with Pustertal-Val Pusteria was terminated by mutual consent. Although he said that \\"the city, the environment and the teammates were outstanding,\\" Guard was disappointed with the level of play in Serie A and, already contemplating retirement, the injury helped make his decision final. In November 2008 Guard announced his retirement from professional hockey.

United States Postal Service, 546 U.S. 481 (2006), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, involving the extent to which the United States Postal Service has sovereign immunity from lawsuits brought by private individuals under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Court ruled that an exception to the FTCA that barred liability for the \\"negligent transmission of mail\\" did not apply to a claim for injuries caused when someone tripped over mail left by a USPS employee. Instead, the exception only applied to damage caused to the mail itself or that resulted from its loss or delay. Background of the case On August 25, 2001, Barbara Dolan fell over letters, packages and periodicals placed on her porch by an employee of the United States Postal Service, suffering serious injury. Dolan initially filed an administrative claim with the Postal Service, which was denied on April 18, 2002. On October 15, 2002, Dolan filed a complaint against the United States and the USPS in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.Judge Mary A. McLaughlin presided over the case. As \\"an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States,\\"Under the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 et seq. the United States Postal Service enjoys federal sovereign immunity absent a waiver. Dolan accordingly brought her claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which waives the government's sovereign immunity for certain claims arising from the negligence of federal employees committed in the course of their employment. On March 19, 2003, the district court granted the government's motion to dismiss, holding that Dolan's claim was barred by the postal exception to the FTCA waiver of immunity, which applied to \\"any claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\\"28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2680(b). Dolan appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal.Dolan v. United States Postal Serv., 377 F.3d 285 (3d Cir. 2004). Judges Anthony Joseph Scirica, Jane Richards Roth, and Theodore Alexander McKee heard the appeal, with Judge Roth writing the unanimous decision. The court's decision The Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit, ruling 7-1The ninth justice, Samuel Alito, was confirmed to the Court after oral argument had already been heard, and so did not participate in the case. that the postal exception under the FTCA did not include all negligence that occurred in the course of mail delivery. Instead, context and precedent required the exception to be limited to negligence that caused mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address. Dolan's suit was accordingly not covered by the exception and could proceed. The majority opinion was delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent, arguing that the majority ignored the plain language of the statute. =Kennedy's majority opinion= The Court first noted that, if considered in isolation, the phrase \\"negligent transmission\\" in the postal exception could include a wide range of negligent acts committed in the course of delivering mail, including creating hazards of the kind for which Dolan sued. However, the complete statutory context and purpose behind a provision informs whether a word extends \\"to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.\\" The Court observed that the words \\"negligent transmission\\" follow the terms, \\"loss\\" and \\"miscarriage, so as to limit the reach of \\"transmission.\\" Since both those terms refer to the failure to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, the Court considered it unlikely that \\"negligent transmission\\" could include injuries such as Dolan's that happened to be caused by postal employees but involved neither the failure to transmit mail nor damage to its contents. The Court found support for its interpretation in Kosak v. United States, , a case involving a claim against the United States Customs Service. The Court in Kosak discussed the postal exception to the FTCA to contrast it from the more general Customs Service exception, noting that one of the principal purposes behind the FTCA was to waive the government's immunity from liability for car accidents caused by postal employees. The postal service exception was therefore drafted narrowly, such that it did not cover all negligence in the course of mail delivery, because postal trucks could be delivering (and therefore \\"transmitting\\") mail when they collide with other vehicles. The Court could find no basis in the text of the statute for distinguishing injuries such as Dolan's that were \\"caused by the mail itself\\" from those caused by the negligent driving of postal vehicles. \\"In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail.\\" The Court also did not believe that the general rule applied that the government's waiver of immunity should be strictly interpreted in its favor. The Court considered this rule \\"unhelpful\\" in the FTCA context, because \\"unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions\\" would defeat the statute's central and sweeping purpose of waiving the government's immunity. =Thomas's dissent= Justice Thomas argued that the Court had failed to give the text of the postal exception its ordinary meaning. The definitions of \\"transmission\\"--\\"act, operation, or process, of transmitting\\"--and \\"transmit\\"--\\"to send or transfer from one person or place to another; to forward by rail, post, wire, etc., . . . to cause . . . to pass or be conveyed\\"--would include the conduct for which Dolan sued.For both definitions, Thomas cited to Webster's New International Dictionary pp. 2692-93 (2d ed. 1934, as republished 1945), the edition in print when the FTCA and the postal exception were enacted. Thomas did not believe there was any reason to conclude that Congress was unaware of these ordinary definitions when it enacted the FTCA and the postal exception in 1946, nor was there any contextual indication that a meaning other than the ordinary sense was intended. Thomas considered that the discussion in Kosak at most established that the postal exception did not apply to auto accidents; that decision accordingly said nothing about \\"slip and fall\\" claims. Thomas furthermore believed that the Court in Kosak considered discrete acts determinative of the scope of Postal Service liability, rather than the consequences of those acts. Kosak therefore could not support for the majority's limitation, which was based on the consequence of the negligence--injury to the mail itself as opposed to injury caused by tripping over the mail. Thomas further argued that even if the postal exception was ambiguous, any such ambiguity as to the scope of the Government's waiver of immunity should be resolved in its favor. Thomas believed the majority erred in failing to apply this rule just because it was construing an exception to waiver rather than waiver itself.

Of all long interval bloomers (or plietesials) Strobilanthes kunthiana is the most rigorously demonstrated, with documented bloomings in 1838, 1850, 1862, 1874, 1886, 1898, 1910, 1922, 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006 and 2018, these have no match to Solar cycles. Other kurinji species, such as Strobilanthes cuspidatus, bloom once every seven years, and then die. Their seeds subsequently sprout and continue the cycle of life and death.

Description Kurinji grows at an altitude of 1300 to 2400 metres. The plant is usually 30 to 60 cm high. They can, however, grow well beyond 180 cm under congenial conditions.Save Kurinji Campaign, Flower of the blue mountains] The kurinji plant belongs to the genus Strobilanthes which was first scientifically described by Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck in the 19th century. The genus has around 250 species, of which at least 46 are found in India. Most of these species show an unusual flowering behavior, varying from annual to 16-year blooming cycles.Kurinji crown - The Palni Hills are once again witnessing the mass flowering of neelakurinji ; Plants that bloom at long intervals like Strobilanthes kunthiana are known as plietesials.

In 2006, Neelakurunji flowered again in Kerala and Tamil Nadu after a gap of 12 years. Thereafter, the Strobilanthes cuspidatus species of kurinji flowers were found blooming in 2016 in Udhagamandalam near a major road. In 2017, Neelakurinji flowers bloomed in the hills behind Kumaraswamy temple in Sanduru, Bellary district. Conservation Kurinjimala Sanctuary protects the kurinji in approximately 32 km¬≤ core habitat in Kottakamboor and Vattavada villages in Idukki district of Kerala. The Save Kurinji Campaign Council organizes campaigns and, programs for conservation of the Kurinji plant and its habit. Kurinji Andavar temple located in Kodaikanal on Tamil Nadu dedicated to Hindu God Kartikeya also preserves Strobilanthes plants. References in literature Kurinji flower is used to describe the associated mountainous landscape where it blooms in classical Tamil literature. The historical novel, Kurinji Flowers by Clare Flynn features the neelakurinji as a backdrop to a tragic love affair in 1940s India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also referenced the neelakurinji in his Independence Day speech in 2018, a year when the neelakurinji was in bloom.

The university provides traditional and accelerated programs of study focused on professional education in pharmacy and the health sciences. Since 2000, MCPHS University has expanded to include two additional campuses, located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Manchester, New Hampshire. History MCPHS University was founded by fourteen Boston pharmacists as the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy in 1823 and is the oldest higher education institution in Boston. It is also the second-oldest and largest college of pharmacy in the United States, followed only by the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy (Now Philadelphia University of Sciences), established in 1821. In 1825, the University published the First American Pharmaceutical Library Catalogue, detailing the effects of many pharmaceutical products. In 1852, the University obtained a charter from the Great Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to award its first formal degree. Accessed: 04/06/15 In 1918, the University built the George Robert White Building in the Longwood Medical Area in Boston, across from Harvard Medical School to serve as its main campus. In 1979, The General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved a reform in the charter of the University to permit degree awarding authority in the allied health sciences, and the University formally changed its name to the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Sciences. The institution would later shorten its name to Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS). MCPHS added a campus in Worcester, Massachusetts in 2000 and an expanded center in Manchester, New Hampshire in 2002. Also In 2002, MCPHS has obtained and integrated the Forsyth School of Dental Hygienists into the University by introducing an Oral Hygiene Course. During this period, MCPHS grew to include a School of Pharmacy, a School of Physician Assistant Studies, a School of Optometry, a School of Physical Therapy, a School of Arts and Sciences, School of Nursing, a School of Dental Hygiene, and a School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics.

It opened in 1966 and is home to the North Carolina State University Wolfpack college baseball team of the NCAA's Division I Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). It is named for Charles Doak, who was the head coach of the NC State baseball team from 1924-1939. The stadium is located on NC State's West Campus, behind Lee and Sullivan residence halls. The diamond is in the north/northwest corner of its block, which is bounded by Thurman Drive (third base, north/northeast); Dail Park and the residence halls (left field, east/southeast); Sullivan Drive (right field, south/southwest); and Varsity Drive (first base, west/northwest). Its seating capacity is 2,500 spectators, with an overflow capacity of 3,000. The largest crowd at Doak Field since its 2004 renovation was 3,109 on April 28, 2007, in a series finale between NC State and its rival UNC. Doak Field hosted the Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament in both 1974 and in 1980. NC State won the championship in 1974, while Clemson won in 1980. Prior to 1966, the Wolfpack played their home games at Riddick Stadium, which was primarily a football facility. Doak Field at Dail Park In May 2004, the stadium underwent a $6 million renovation which included leveling the playing field, a new drainage system, new grandstands, a new press box, and new concessions and bathroom facilities. Since the renovation was completed in 2004, the dimensions at Doak Field are asymmetrical at 320 feet down the left-field line, 370 feet to the left-field power alley, 400 feet to straightaway center field, 375 feet to the right- field power alley, and 330 down the right-field line. The wall from the left- field line to deep left-center field is 16 feet high, then drops to eight feet high all the rest of the way around to right field. In 2013, the Wolfpack ranked 33rd among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 1,994 per home game. In 2014, the Wolfpack ranked 45th in attendance, averaging 1,344 per home game.

History Secular scouting in Luxembourg started in 1914. In 1916, twelve local Scout groups founded the F√©d√©ration Nationale des Eclaireurs du Luxembourg. The federation was among the founding members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1922. In 1940, under the German occupation, Scouting was banned in Luxembourg. The Scout groups went underground, some members were arrested in concentration camps. In 1945, the FNEL and the L√´tzebuerger Scouten founded the Luxembourg Boy Scouts Association onto which the WOSM membership was transferred. The former boys-only FNEL opened to girls in 1966 and added the words et Eclaireuses (and Girl Guides) to its name in 1971. in 2014, the Association des Girl Guides Luxembourgeoises moved its remaining members into the FNEL and terminated its activities. Program The FNEL is one of the very few Scouting and Guiding organizations that is still today heavily influenced by the ideas of Ernest Thompson Seton and his Woodcraft movement.

Biography Weston was born in Huntington Beach, California, in 1935, and grew up in nearby Downey. In 1954, Weston joined the original Roller Derby headed by promoter Leo Seltzer, becoming a favorite member of the Los Angeles Braves. Her fame increased markedly when in 1965 she was appointed captain of the San Francisco Bay Bombers. She appeared on 19 consecutive all-star teams in that sport, and was the highest-paid female athlete in the 1960s and 1970s. Joan usually skated as the distaff heroine of the sport, no matter what team she appeared with. She remains the most beloved of all historical Roller Derby stars. Her long-time rivals on the track included Ann Calvello (August 1, 1929 ‚Äì March 14, 2006), Cathie Read (b. August 17, 1940), Sandy Dunn (b. January 8, 1945), Jan Vallow (b. September 21, 1940), and Margie Laszlo (b. November 8, 1942). The 1972 film Kansas City Bomber, starring Raquel Welch, was supposedly inspired by (but not based on) Weston. Weston was a mentor to many professional Roller Derby skaters that made it on a team. She was said to take rookies under her wing. Roller Derby was not Weston's only sport. While a student at Mount St. Mary's College, Weston played softball. She was also involved in surfing and canoeing. In 1962 she won the Hawaii canoe outrigger championship. Weston later married Nick Scopas (b. June 3, 1938) who was also a professional Roller Derby Skater. After her Roller Derby career, she regularly played softball in San Francisco Bay Area leagues. In 1997, at age 62, Weston succumbed to Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease in Hayward, California. In 1999, her life story was sold to Goldie Hawn Productions. Roller Derby ceased operations in 1973 and as a result the most famous female skater in the sport was never inducted into its Hall of Fame. In 2004, the skater/fan based Roller Derby Hall of Fame based in Brooklyn, New York, corrected this oversight.

This charity closed in December 2011. Career Johnson trained at the University of Cambridge, the London Hospital, and at Claybury Hospital, Essex, where he obtained a grounding in group work and therapeutic community techniques. In 1964 he was appointed as a Senior Psychiatrist in Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital, New York, working in the Drug Addiction Unit and the acute wards. He was the consultant psychiatrist in the Special Unit in HMP Parkhurst for dangerous prisoners.

History Feiring has around 1000 inhabitants. Feiring lies on the west side of the lake Mj√∏sa. In 1870 the area became a municipality in its own right when it was split from Hurdal. Feiring had an area of 102.45 km2. It then merged into the municipality Eidsvoll in 1964. Norwegian National Road 33, the state road between Minnesund and √òstre Toten, which runs through Feiring, was built in the 1890s. Feiring church (Feiring Kirke) was built in 1870. The original plan had been to restore the old church from 1693, but after debate in the local council it was decided to build a new church. All the same, much of the material which was used to build the new church was borrowed from the old church, which was made of timber. In the 17th century about 20 copper- mines were set up to the north and north-west of the church, with the smelting works by Flesvikelva. From 1806 to 1818 Carsten Anker ran the Feiring Iron Works by Skreikampen. Feiring Ironworks is one of the best preserved post- Industrial Revolution ironworks in Norway. The housing stands almost completely untouched to this day. The ironworks sites and the remains of the smelter have been restored and Eidsvoll Historical Society has erected information-posts around the work area. In recent years an annual historical play has been performed in the grounds of the ironworks. Ironworks Weekend (Jernverkshelga) is held in August.(Feiring jernverk) The treatment and rehabilitation centre for heart disease, Feiringklinikken (The Feiring clinic), run by the Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization used to lie in the centre of Kirkebygda, down towards Lake Mj√∏sa, but during the spring of 2018 it moved to Jessheim. One can still see the mile-marker by Norwegian National Road 33, which indicates the border between √òstre Toten and Eidsvoll municipalities.

The single triode vacuum tube amplifies the radio signal, then also amplifies the audio modulation signal extracted from it by the detector. A reflex radio receiver, occasionally called a reflectional receiver, is a radio receiver design in which the same amplifier is used to amplify the high-frequency radio signal (RF) and low-frequency audio (sound) signal (AF). It was first invented in 1914 by German scientists Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk,US Patent no. 1087892, Wilhelm Schloemilch and Otto von Bronk Means for receiving electrical oscillations, filed March 14, 1913; granted February 17, 1914 and rediscovered and extended to multiple tubes in 1917 by Marius LatourUS Patent no. 1405523, Marius Latour Audion or lamp relay or amplifying apparatus, filed December 28, 1917; granted February 7, 1922 and William H. Priess. The radio signal from the antenna and tuned circuit passes through an amplifier, is demodulated in a detector which extracts the audio signal from the radio carrier, and the resulting audio signal passes again through the same amplifier for audio amplification before being applied to the earphone or loudspeaker. The reason for using the amplifier for \\"double duty\\" was to reduce the number of active devices, vacuum tubes or transistors, required in the circuit, to reduce the cost. The economical reflex circuit was used in inexpensive vacuum tube radios in the 1920s, and was revived again in simple portable tube radios in the 1930s. How it works Block diagram of a simple single-tube reflex radio receiver The block diagram shows the general form of a simple reflex receiver. The receiver functions as a tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver. The radio frequency (RF) signal from the tuned circuit (bandpass filter) is amplified, then passes through the high pass filter to the demodulator, which extracts the audio frequency (AF) (modulation) signal from the carrier wave. The audio signal is added back into the input of the amplifier, and is amplified again. At the output of the amplifier the audio is separated from the RF signal by the low pass filter and is applied to the earphone. The amplifier could be a single stage or multiple stages. It can be seen that since each active device (tube or transistor) is used to amplify the signal twice, the reflex circuit is equivalent to an ordinary receiver with double the number of active devices. The reflex receiver should not be confused with a regenerative receiver, in which the same signal is fed back from the output of the amplifier to its input. In the reflex circuit it is only the audio extracted by the demodulator which is added to the amplifier input, so there are two separate signals at different frequencies passing through the amplifier at the same time. The reason the two signals, the RF and AF currents, can pass simultaneously through the amplifier without interfering is due to the superposition principle because the amplifier is linear. Since the two signals have different frequencies, they can be separated at the output with frequency selective filters. Therefore the proper functioning of the circuit depends on the amplifier operating in the linear region of its transfer curve. If the amplifier is significantly nonlinear, intermodulation distortion will occur and the audio signal will modulate the RF signal, resulting in audio feedback which can cause a shrieking in the earphone. The presence of the audio return circuit from the amplifier output to input made the reflex circuit vulnerable to such parasitic oscillation problems.  Applications  The most common application of the reflex circuit in the 1920s was in inexpensive single tube receivers, because many consumers could not afford more than one vacuum tube, and the reflex circuit got the most out of a single tube, it was equivalent to a two-tube set. During this period the demodulator was usually a carborundum point contact diode, but sometimes a vacuum tube grid-leak detector. However multitube receivers like the TRF and superheterodyne were also made with some of their amplifier stages \\"reflexed\\". The reflex principle was used in compact Australian superheterodyne radio receivers of the late 1940s and very early 1950s; the intermediate frequency amplifier stage was also the first audio frequency stage using a reflex arrangement. At least one type of tube was specially designed for this kind of receiver design. Example Single tube reflex AM receiver, one of the most common reflex circuits, from the early 1920s The diagram (right) shows one of the most common single tube reflex circuits from the early 1920s. It functioned as a TRF receiver with one stage of RF and one stage of audio amplification. The radio frequency (RF) signal from the antenna passes through the bandpass filter C1, L1, L2, C2 and is applied to the grid of the directly heated triode, V1. The capacitor C6 bypasses the RF signal around the audio transformer winding T2 which would block it. The amplified signal from the plate of the tube is applied to the RF transformer L3, L4 while C3 bypasses the RF signal around the headphone coils. The tuned secondary L4, C5 which is tuned to the input frequency, serves as a second bandpass filter as well as blocking the audio signal in the plate circuit from getting to the detector. Its output is rectified by semiconductor diode D, which was a carborundum point contact type. The resulting audio signal extracted by the diode from the RF signal is coupled back into the grid circuit by audio transformer T1, T2 whose iron core serves as a choke to help prevent RF from getting back into the grid circuit and causing feedback. The capacitor C4 provides more protection against feedback, blocking the pulses of RF from the diode, but is usually not needed since the transformer's winding T1 normally has enough parasitic capacitance. The audio signal is applied to the grid of the tube and amplified. The amplified audio signal from the plate passes easily through the low inductance RF primary winding L3 and is applied to the earphones T. The rheostat R1 controlled the filament current, and in these early sets was used as a volume control.

He served in office from May 13, 1648 to April 22, 1649. His name is sometimes given as Marcos Torres y Rueda. In Spain Marcos de Torres y Rueda was born in Spain in 1591 (some sources say 1588). He studied at the University of Alcal√° de Henares, with much distinction, graduating as licenciado in arts. Thereafter he occupied the chair of theology at Alcal√°, and also at the University of Valladolid. He was canon of the cathedral of Burgos and rector of the College of San Nicol√°s in Burgos when King Philip IV of Spain nominated him for bishop of Yucatan. Pope Innocent X named him to fill the position on December 18, 1645. In the New World He arrived in New Spain the following year, was consecrated a bishop in Puebla, and took up his position as bishop November 9, 1646. Only a few months later, on July 10, 1647, King Philip IV of Spain named him viceroy and president of the Audiencia. He arrived in Mexico City and took up his new offices on May 13, 1648, leaving the governance of the Diocese of Yucatan in the hands of the chapter of the cathedral. The outgoing viceroy, Garc√≠a Sarmiento de Sotomayor, 2nd Count of Salvatierra, did not wish to surrender his office or the royal treasury, and direct intervention from the crown was needed. Because of his other duties, he was not present at the installation of Our Lady of Izamal as patron of Yucatan (August 23, 1648). He governed the viceroyalty for a little less than one year. The most notable occurrence during this time was the auto de fe held April 11 to April 12, 1649 in the plaza El Volador. There 13 men and women were garroted to death and another 94 received lashes. In the former group was Tom√°s Tremi√±o de Campos, a Portuguese Jew. Among the things he was accused of were using the \\"Mexican language\\" and speaking ill of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, the king and the pope. Antonio B√°ez and B. Tirado were accused of saying \\"Christians are beasts\\". Pedro Mercado was accused of giving preferential seating to Jews at a comedy he produced. By this point very ill, the viceroy did not attend the event. He died shortly after in Mexico City. On April 14, 1649, days before the viceroy's death, a revolt broke out among the Tarahumara Indians in northern New Spain. Torres y Rueda was too ill to deal with it, and it was left to his successor, Luis Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n, conde de Alba de Liste. Torres y Rueda died April 22, 1649 in Mexico City. He was interred in the church of the convent of San Agust√≠n. The Audiencia (high court) took up the government, pending the arrival of the new viceroy. Although he performed the functions of viceroy and his name consistently appears in the lists of viceroys of New Spain, technically Torres y Rueda never formally held the title. His title was gobernador (governor).Cayetana Alvarez de Toledo, Politics and Reform in Spain and Viceregal Mexico: The Life and Thought of Juan de Palafox 1600‚Äì1659. Oxford: Clarendon Press 2004. Because he was not fully empowered as viceroy, he could not make appointments to office or remove officeholders, which left viceroy Salvatierra's clients in place. Torres y Rueda was initially a firm supporter of Palafox, and so when offices became vacant, Torres appointed American-born Spaniards, following Palafox's aim to favor them over peninsular-born candidates. Furthermore, he dismissed complaints by the Jesuits against Palafox about Palafox's putting education in the hands of the secular clergy in Puebla and removing it from Jesuits. Torres wrote the king that \\"he was in entire agreement with the bishop of Puebla [Palafox] over how New Spain should be governed.\\" However, Torres subsequently abandoned his support of Palafox and reform. Torres's advisers were major figures who supported viceroy Salvatierra. Torres himself started pursuing practices that brought wealth to himself, including deals with judges and merchants allowing him amass a huge fortune.

The set of techniques for doing so falls under Crowley's term Magick, which draws upon various existing disciplines and mystical models, including Yoga, Western ceremonial ritual (especially invocations and eucharistic ceremony), the Qabalah, and several divination systems, especially the tarot and astrology. The path to mystical attainment or enlightenment was initially developed by Crowley largely based on the meditation/mystical techniques found in Buddhism and also the Tree of Life, especially as it was examined by Eliphas Levi in the 19th century and later by various members in the occult society, the Golden Dawn. In 1904, Crowley claimed to have transcribed, via \\"direct-voice transmission\\" from a \\"praeternatural intelligence\\" named Aiwass, The Book of the Law, which he eventually called the central sacred text of Thelema, heralding a new Aeon for mankind. Between 1907 and 1911, Crowley wrote a series of other small texts which he considered to be \\"inspired\\" in that they were written through him rather than by him, which were afterwards collected together and termed the Holy Books. The final text added to the list was The Vision and the Voice, a vivid account of Crowley's astral travels through the thirty Enochian Aethyrs. These texts formed the final mystical backbone of Crowley's system. Essential practices Within the system that Crowley developed, the core task for the adept is the discovery and manifestation of Will, defined at times as a grand destiny and at other times as a moment to moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with Nature. This Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the deepest Self and the entire Universe. Therefore, the enlightened Thelemite is one who is able to eliminate or bypass the consciousness-created desires, conflicts, and habits, and tap directly into the Self/Universe nexus. Theoretically, at this point, the Thelemite acts in alignment with Nature, just as the stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor \\"lust of result.\\" The ability to accomplish this Great Work requires a great deal of preparation and effort, according to Crowley's system. The programme consists of several key elements, including a thorough knowledge of the Hermetic Qabalah (especially the Tree of Life), disciplined concentration (i.e. meditation), the development of one's Body of Light (or astral body) (in order to experience other spiritual realms) and the consistent and regular invocation of certain deities or spiritual beings. =Learning the Tree of Life= The Tree of Life is a tool used to categorize and organize various mystical concepts. At its most simple level it is composed of ten spheres, or emanations, called sephiroth (sing. \\"sephira\\") which are connected by twenty-two paths. The sephiroth are represented by the planets and the paths by the characters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are subdivided by the five elements, the seven classical planets, and the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Within the western magical tradition, the Tree is used as a kind of conceptual filing cabinet. Each sephira and path is assigned various ideas, such as gods, cards of the Tarot, astrological planets and signs, elements, etc. Within Thelema, the seminal book which defines all these correspondences is Crowley's Liber 777, although there have been other influential writers on the topic, including Israel Regardie and Eliphas Levi. The path of attainment is largely defined by the Tree of Life. The aspirant begins in Malkuth, which is the everyday material world of phenomena, with the ultimate goal being at Kether, the sphere of Unity with the All. Through various exercises and practices, he or she attains certain spiritual and mental states that are characterized by the various sephiroth that ascend the Tree. Crowley considered a deep understanding of the Qabalah to be essential to the Thelemite: > The Tree of Life has got to be learnt by heart; you must know it backwards, > forwards, sideways, and upside down; it must become the automatic background > of all your thinking. You must keep on hanging everything that comes your > way upon its proper bough.Crowley, Magick Without Tears, ch. IV and, > The art of using it consists principally in referring all our ideas to it, > discovering thus the common nature of certain things and the essential > differences between others, so that ultimately one obtains a simple view of > the incalculably vast complexity of the Universe. > > The whole subject must be studied in the Book 777, and the main > attributions committed to memory: then when by constant use the system is at > last understood‚Äîas opposed to being merely memorised‚Äîthe student will find > fresh light break in on him at every turn as he continues to measure every > item of new knowledge that he attains by this Standard. For to him the > Universe will then begin to appear as a coherent and a necessary > Whole.Crowley, Little Essays Towards Truth, \\"Man\\" Part of the reason why the Qabalah is so important is that it is the key to understanding the Holy Books. Most of them, including The Book of the Law, are written in abstract, poetic, and often obscure language. Through the use of the Qabalah, and especially the function of gematria (a form of numerology), the normally opaque meaning of the texts can be made clear. Thelemites can also make use of gematria to link words and concepts and to validate revelations given to them in magical operations, such as astral travel. =Concentration= Another key element to Thelemic mysticism is the ability to concentrate. This skill has two modalities: the first is the rapid, accurate, and efficient movement of thought (which is the realm of magick) and the other is the stopping of thought altogether (which is accomplished in Yoga). In the first, it is the manipulation of all ideas into one idea, and in the second is the taking of that one thought and reducing it to nothing. Of this skill, Crowley writes: > For concentration does indeed unlock all doors; it lies at the heart of > every practice as it is of the essence of all theory; and almost all the > various rules and regulations are aimed at securing adeptship in this > matter. All the subsidiary work‚Äîawareness, one-pointedness, mindfulness and > the rest‚Äîis intended to train you to this.Magick Without Tears, ch. XVI Concentration is essentially the prerequisite for all sustained success, not only in spiritual practices, but in day-to-day life as well. The general program for developing concentration is borrowed almost completely from the practice of Yoga within the Hindu and Buddhist systems. Crowley gives a general overview of the techniques in two books: Eight Lectures on Yoga and in the section called \\"Mysticism\\" in his opus, Magick (Book 4). =Body of Light and astral travel= The Body of Light‚ÄîCrowley's term for the subtle body‚Äîis the theoretical aspect of self that can leave the corporeal body and carry one's senses and consciousness during astral travels. Crowley writes of it in Book 4: \\"The work of the Body of Light‚Äîwith the technique of Yoga‚Äîis the foundation of Magick.\\" > The Body of Light must be developed and trained with exactly the same rigid > discipline as the brain in the case of mysticism. The essence of the > technique of Magick is the development of the Body of Light, which must be > extended to include all members of the organism, and indeed of the cosmos > [...] The object is to possess a Body which is capable of doing easily any > particular task that may lie before it. There must be no selection of > special experience which appeals to one's immediate desire. One must go > steadily through all possible pylons.Crowley, ABA: chapter 21 Crowley explains that the most important practices for developing the Body of Light are: # The fortification of the Body of Light by the constant use of rituals, by the assumption of god-forms, and by the right use of the Eucharist. # The purification and consecration and exaltation of that Body by the use of rituals of invocation. # The education of that Body by experience. It must learn to travel on every plane; to break down every obstacle which may confront it. The benefit of astral travel is essentially one of education...it is akin to exploring one's own spiritual universe (\\"Every Magician possesses an Astral Universe peculiar to himself\\"Crowley,Book 4, Apx. 3) and understanding the fundamental components, so that the adept can eventually master it. The general object is the \\"control of the Astral Plane, the ability to find one's way about it, to penetrate such sanctuaries as are guarded from the profane, [and] to make such relations with its inhabitants as may avail to acquire knowledge and power, or to command service\\". Also, \\"one's apprehension of the Astral Plane must be accurate, for Angels, Archangels, and Gods are derived therefrom by analysis. One must have pure materials if one wishes to brew pure beer.\\" It is vital to understand that all this must be in service to the Great Work of discovering one's True Will: > Let the Magician therefore adventure himself upon the Astral Plane with the > declared design to penetrate to a sanctuary of discarnate Beings such as are > able to instruct and fortify him, also to prove their identity by testimony > beyond rebuttal. All explanations other than these are of value only as > extending and equilibrating Knowledge, or possibly as supplying Energy to > such Magicians as may have found their way to the Sources of Strength. In > all cases, naught is worth an obol save as it serve to help the One Great > Work\\" Crowley was also willing to admit that what was experienced during \\"astral travel\\" was not relevant in terms of what is \\"real\\" or \\"unreal.\\" Ultimately, the only value to this practice is in the utility it provides to the adept. > The 'reality' or 'objectivity' of these symbols is not pertinent to the > discussion. [...] The Magician must not accept [my] account of the Astral > Plane, [my] Qabalistic discoveries, [my] instructions in Magick. They may be > correct in the main for most men; yet they cannot be wholly true for any > save [myself], even as no two artists can make identical pictures of the > same subject [...] What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it > be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality > [...] The true, the final test, of the Truth of one's visions is their > Value. The most glorious experience on the Astral plane, let it dazzle and > thrill as it may, is not necessarily in accordance with the True Will of the > seer; if not, though it be never so true objectively, it is not true for > him, because not useful for him. The Body of Light is more important than simply for astral travel‚Äîit is the storehouse of all experiences. > In Magick, on the contrary, one passes through the veil of the exterior > world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes \\"unreal\\" by > comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a > better term) called the Body of Light; this one develops and controls; it > gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called > 'initiation': finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body > of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.Crowley, > Magick Without Tears, Ch. 81 =Magick ritual= According to Crowley, there is a single definition of the purpose for ritual magick: to achieve Union with God through \\"the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm.\\" Since this process is so arduous, it is also acceptable to use magick to develop the self (i.e. one's Body of Light) or to create ideal circumstances for the Work (e.g. having access to a place in which to do ritual undisturbed). There are many kinds of magick, but the categories of ritual that are recommended by Crowley include (all quotes are from Book 4): # Banishing‚Äîthe elimination of unwanted forces. \\"The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of purification, firstly, of himself, secondly, of his instruments, thirdly, of the place of working.\\" # Invocation, where the magician identifies with the Deity invoked. There are three methods: #* Devotion ‚Äîwhere \\"identity with the God is attained by love and by surrender, by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant (and illusionary) parts of yourself.\\" (e.g. Liber Astarte ) #* Calling forth‚Äîwhere \\"identity is attained by paying special attention to the desired part of yourself: positive, as the first method is negative.\\" (e.g. assumption of god-forms) #* Drama‚Äîwhere \\"identity is attained by sympathy. It is very difficult for the ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a novel; but for those who can do so, this method is unquestionably the best.\\" (e.g. many initiations and the Gnostic Mass) # Evocation‚Äîwhich is bringing a spiritual being before, not into, the magician (e.g. Goetia) # Eucharistic ritual‚Äîwhich \\"consists in taking common things, transmuting them into things divine, and consuming them.\\" (e.g. The Mass of the Phoenix ) # Consecration‚Äî\\"the active dedication of a thing to a single purpose.\\" # Divinations‚Äîsuch as the use of the Tarot or other tools used to gather information. Mystical milestones within the A.A. System Crowley often wrote that every adept's path will be unique. He also wrote that two major milestones are fundamental to Thelemic mysticism, which he called the knowledge of and conversation with one's Holy Guardian Angel and the crossing of the Abyss. Crowley wrote, \\"the two crises‚Äîthe Angel and the Abyss‚Äîare necessary features in every career. The other tasks are not always accomplished in [any given order]\\".Confessions, ch.2 =The Holy Guardian Angel= Even though the Holy Guardian Angel (or HGA) is, in a sense, the ‚Äúhigher self‚Äù, it is often experienced as a separate being, independent from the adept. In the system of the A‚à¥A‚à¥ magical order, the single most important goal is to consciously connect with one‚Äôs HGA, a process termed ‚ÄúKnowledge and Conversation.‚Äù By doing so, the magician becomes fully aware of his own True Will. For Crowley, this event was the single most important goal of any adept: > It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and > essential work of the Magician is the attainment of the Knowledge and > Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must > of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably > and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step‚Äîcrossing of > the Abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.Crowley, > Magick Without Tears, Ch.83 In most of his writings, Crowley described the Holy Guardian Angel as one's \\"Silent Self\\", at times equitable with one's deepest unconscious. In later writings, he insisted that the HGA is an entirely separate and objective being. Whichever position is taken, the object remains the same‚Äîto gain an intimate spiritual connection so that one's True Will can become fully known and manifested. When using the Tree of Life as a guide, this event occurs in the Sphere of Tiphareth. Crowley wrote Liber Samekh as an example of a ritual designed specifically for attaining the Knowledge and Conversation with one‚Äôs HGA. In his notes to this ritual, Crowley sums up the key to success: ‚ÄúINVOKE OFTEN.‚Äù Another detailed description of the general operation is given in The Vision and the Voice, Aethyr 8 . =Crossing the Abyss= After one attains Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel, the adept may choose to then reach the next major milestone: the crossing of the Abyss, the great gulf or void between the phenomenal world of manifestation and its noumenal source, that great spiritual wilderness which must be crossed by the adept to attain mastery. > This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or > less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is Actual, and the > Unreal, which is Ideal. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in > posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of > spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane > Delusions.Crowley, Little Essays Towards Truth: Man Choronzon is the Dweller in the Abyss; he is there as the final obstruction. If he is met with the proper preparation, then he is there to destroy the ego, which allows the adept to move beyond the Abyss. If unprepared, then the unfortunate traveller will be utterly dispersed into annihilation. Both Choronzon and the Abyss are discussed in Crowley's Confessions (ch. 66): > The name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choronzon, but he is not really an > individual. The Abyss is empty of being; it is filled with all possible > forms, each equally inane, each therefore evil in the only true sense of the > word‚Äîthat is, meaningless but malignant, in so far as it craves to become > real. These forms swirl senselessly into haphazard heaps like dust devils, > and each such chance aggregation asserts itself to be an individual and > shrieks, \\"I am I!\\" though aware all the time that its elements have no true > bond; so that the slightest disturbance dissipates the delusion just as a > horseman, meeting a dust devil, brings it in showers of sand to the > earth.Confessions, chapter 66 However, just on the other side of the Abyss awaits Babalon. She calls the adept to surrender completely, so that he or she may cross over. =Babalon, the City of the Pyramids, and the Night of Pan= Choronzon is the dweller within the Abyss, and his purpose is to trap the traveller in a meaningless world of illusion. However Babalon is just on the other side, beckoning (in the sphere of Binah on the Tree of Life). If the adept gives himself to her‚Äîthe symbol of this act is the pouring of the adept‚Äôs blood into her graal‚Äîhe becomes impregnated in her (a state called \\"Babe of the Abyss\\"), then he is reborn as a Master and a Saint that dwells in the City of the Pyramids. The City of the Pyramids is the home to those adepts that have crossed the great Abyss, having spilled all their blood in the Graal of Babalon. They have destroyed their earthly ego-identities, becoming nothing more than piles of dust (i.e. the remaining aspects of their True Selves without the self-sense of \\"I\\"). Within, they take on the name or title of Saint or Nemo (Latin for No-Man or No-One). In the system of A‚à¥A‚à¥ they are called Masters of the Temple. It is a step along the path of spiritual purification, and a spiritual resting place for those who have successfully shed their attachments to the mundane world. Of these adepts, it is written in The Vision and the Voice (Aethyr 14): > These adepts seem like Pyramids‚Äîtheir hoods and robes are like Pyramids > [...] And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is > no more. There is no more knowledge. There is no more bliss. There is no > more power. There is no more beauty. For this is the Palace of > Understanding: for thou art one with the Primeval things.' > The Master of the Temple accordingly interferes not with the scheme of > things, except just so far as he is doing the Work which he is sent to do. > Why should he struggle against imprisonment, banishment, death? [...] The > Master of the Temple is so far from the man in whom He manifests that all > these matters are of no importance to Him. It may be of importance to His > Work that man shall sit upon a throne, or be hanged.Confessions, chapter 21 > I was instantly blotted in blackness. Mine Angel whispered the secret words > whereby one partakes of the Mysteries of the Masters of the Temple. > Presently my eyes beheld (what first seemed shapes of rocks) the Masters, > veiled in motionless majesty, shrouded in silence. Each one was exactly like > the other. Then the Angel bade me understand whereto my aspiration led: all > powers, all ecstasies, ended in this‚ÄîI understood. He then told me that now > my name was Nemo, seated among the other silent shapes in the City of the > Pyramids under the Night of Pan; those other parts of me that I had left for > ever below the Abyss must serve as a vehicle for the energies which had been > created by my act. My mind and body, deprived of the ego which they had > hitherto obeyed, were now free to manifest according to their nature in the > world, to devote themselves to aid mankind in its evolution. In my case I > was to be cast out into the Sphere of Jupiter. My mortal part was to help > humanity by Jupiterian work, such a governing, teaching, creating, exhorting > men to aspire to become nobler, holier, worthier, kinglier, kindlier and > more generous. The City exists under the Night of Pan, or N.O.X. The playful and lecherous Pan is the Greek god of nature, lust, and the masculine generative power. The Greek word Pan also translates as All, and so he is ‚Äúa symbol of the Universal, a personification of Nature; both Pangenetor, \\"all-begetter,\\" and Panphage, \\"all-devourer\\" (Sabazius, 1995). Therefore, Pan is both the giver and the taker of life, and his Night is that time of symbolic death where the adept experiences unification with the All through the ecstatic destruction of the ego-self. In a less poetic symbolic sense, this is the state where one transcends all limitations and experiences oneness with the universe. =Magus and Ipsissimus= Only a few reach the final two stages, The penultimate is the becoming of a Magus (symbolized by entering Chokmah on the Tree of Life), whose essential duty is to communicate a new Truth to mankind. Of the Magi, Crowley writes: > There are many magical teachers but in recorded history we have scarcely had > a dozen Magi in the technical sense of the word. They may be recognized by > the fact that their message may be formulated as a single word, which word > must be such that it overturns all existing beliefs and codes. We may take > as instances the Word of Buddha‚ÄîAnatta (absence of an atman or soul) [...] > Mohammed, again, with the single word Allah [...] Similarly, Aiwass, > uttering the word Thelema (with all its implications), destroys completely > the formula of the Dying God.Confessions, ch. 49 The state of being a Magus is described in Crowley's Liber B vel Magi. Elsewhere, he admits the possibility of someone reaching this rank without uttering a new magick Word. Such a Magus, he says, would identify himself or herself with the Word of the current Aeon and work to establish it. In Magick Without Tears, Crowley suggests (without actually saying so) that the Secret Chiefs of the A‚à¥A‚à¥ have reached at least the rank of Magus, in some sense. The state of Ipsissimus is the very highest possible (symbolized by the sphere of Kether on the Tree of Life). Relatively little is openly written of this state of enlightenment > The Ipsissimus is wholly free from all limitations whatsoever, existing in > the nature of all things without discriminations of quantity or quality > between them. He has identified Being and not-Being and Becoming, action and > non-action and tendency to action, with all other such triplicities, not > distinguishing between them in respect of any conditions, or between any one > thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or without conditions. > > He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to > express its nature in word and deed, but to withdraw Himself at once within > the veils of his natural manifestation as a man, and to keep silence during > his human life as to the fact of his attainment, even to the other members > of the Order. > > The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that > is, his being is entirely free from internal or external necessity.

Biography and career Kristian Hoffman came into public consciousness as the best friend of Lance Loud in the PBS series An American Family.The New York Times His sister is the writer Nina Kiriki Hoffman. During the mid 1970s, Hoffman emerged as songwriter and keyboardist for New York City based band Mumps, and was also an active figure in the No Wave, performing alongside the likes of Lydia Lunch and the Contortions, and playing keys and singing on the James White and the Blacks LP Off White. As a member of Bleaker St. Incident, with Ann Magnuson and Robert Mache, he spearheaded the \\"anti-folk\\" movement. Concurrently he was in the lounge rock band The Swinging Madisons, and was the original musical director for Klaus Nomi, writing many of Nomi's best known songs. Hoffman later played in Kid Congo Powers' group Congo Norvell. By the 1990s, Hoffman was performing regularly as a solo artist; in 1993, he issued his debut I Don't Love My Guru Anymore, followed four years later by Earthquake Weather. For the remainder of the decade, Hoffman worked with Dave Davies and El Vez on various projects and also served as music director for Ann Magnuson and Rufus Wainwright. In 2002, he and producer Earle Mankey crafted a third album of duets, &. & included collaborations such as \\"Get It Right This Time\\" with that dog.'s Anna Waronker, \\"Scarecrow\\" with Rufus Wainwright, and \\"Devil May Care\\" with Russell Mael of Sparks. \\"Revert to Type\\" featured string arrangements from Van Dyke Parks. \\"Madison Avenue\\" is a duet with El Vez, \\"The Mexican Elvis.\\" There is also a guest appearance from Pee Wee Herman AKA Paul Reubens. There are team- ups with the Three O'Clock's Michael Quercio, Maria McKee of Lone Justice, Lydia Lunch, and Ann Magnuson. Hoffman is also an artist who has designed album cover art for such musicians as The Voltaires, Andrew, and X, and for releases such as eggBERT Records' Hollies tribute Sing Hollies In Reverse, as well as his own \\"He Means Well\\" limited addition 45 cover. Hoffman's art was also highlighted in the books Two Blocks East of Vine by Iris Berry, and Incriminating Evidence by Lydia Lunch. His most famous art composition to date probably remains the notorious \\"Bendover Girl\\" from an insert in the original edition of the New York Dolls' first album, since reproduced on tee shirts, tattoos and drum heads all over the world. In 2005, Hoffman was featured in two separate one-man art shows in Los Angeles galleries ‚Äî the first an extensive retrospective of thirty years of illustrative work, and the other a showing of several new larger format works. He also designed the poster for the Green Day Documentary Heart Like a Hand Grenade. In late 2005, a documentary on Klaus Nomi, The Nomi Song, directed by Andrew Horn, was released and received wide critical praise and several awards. The documentary has since come out on DVD (a Palm Pictures Release). It features extensive interviews with Hoffman and many of Nomi's other key collaborators, as well as footage of many rare concert and television appearances by Nomi. Four of Hoffman's compositions for Nomi are featured in the film, as well as some original incidental music and some clips of Mumps songs. The DVD extras include an extended interview with Hoffman wherein he details the thoughts behind each song he composed for Nomi. Also released in 2005 was How I Saved the World, a newly remastered Mumps compilation, with all the tracks on the original 1995 eggBERT release plus ten extra unreleased tracks, all composed by Hoffman. The compilation also includes a full color 24 page booklet and a companion DVD of vintage Mumps performances at CBGBs and other venues, with optional commentary by Hoffman. This double-disc compilation was released by Sympathy For The Record Industry Records. Hoffman spent much of the first half of 2006 producing a new full-length CD for long-time collaborator Ann Magnuson, called Pretty Songs and Ugly Stories. Besides playing on the album with his band The Rock Gods, Hoffman also co-wrote ten of the songs with Magnuson. Rufus Wainwright added a one-man chorale to the CD's \\"Whatever Happened To New York.\\" Other songs on the CD feature performances by the Chapin Sisters, Jonathan Lea of the Jigsaw Seen, DJ Bonebrake of X, and Heather Lockie of Listing Ship. The album was released December 2006. The record release party in the Disney Concert Hall's Redcat Theater was sold out, necessitating the addition of a second show. Guest artists for the shows included Candypants' Lisa Jenio, as well as Prince Poppycock. Two sold out shows at L.A.'s Steve Allen Theater followed quickly thereafter. Throughout 2007, Hoffman continued to be Ann Magnuson's musical director as she played select dates around the country to promote Pretty Songs. Hoffman has also served as a regular member of the Mink Stole band, the Abby Travis band, the Carolyn Edwards band, and the Jane Wiedlin lounge combo Downtown Sensation. In addition, he has appeared as a session musician on albums by Andrew, the Jigsaw Seen, Carolyn Edwards, Blow Up (with Deborah Harry), and El Vez. For over three years, Hoffman was the keyboard player for the popular Velvet Hammer Burlesque house band, led by the Millionaire (of Combustible Edison fame). The Velvet Hammer Burlesque ran monthly at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles until director/producer Michelle Carr relocated to Germany. The band occasionally played original Hoffman compositions. Hoffman's original compositions were also featured in the film documentary The Velvet Hammer Burlesque, by filmmaker Augusta. Other regular solo and duet appearances by Hoffman included a series at Hollywood's late Parlour Club, hosted by performance artist Vaginal Creme Davis. Hoffman reported on his official website, as well as his Myspace and Facebook pages, that he had finished recording his new 17 song album, Fop, in late 2008; that it was being mixed by Earle Mankey; and that its release was expected in mid-2009. It released in October 2010. On July 27, 2010, the classical-crossover act Timur and the Dime Museum released their album, The Collection: Songs from the Operatic Underground, containing five cover songs by Kristian Hoffman, with Kristian Hoffman, playing the piano on Total Eclipse. LA Weekly compared Kristian Hoffman's lyrics in the song \\"Lite of the World\\", as \\"dark lyrics that wouldn't be out of place on a Thom Yorke album\\". Hoffman has also served as a DJ on Internet radio station LuxuriaMusic.com. Hoffman is openly gay and was reported by The Advocate in 2005 to have a partner, playwright Justin Tanner.Hensley, Dennis (October 11, 2005). \\"Justin's Time\\". The Advocate.

It was recorded in 1976 by DiscReet Records, who had intended to release it with Virgin Records as Captain Beefheart's tenth studio album. It was co-produced by Beefheart and Kerry McNab. The album was a subject of friction between DiscReet cofounders Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa. Cohen had used Zappa's royalty checks to fund the album's production, and this led Zappa to withhold the master tapes from Virgin. Beefheart recorded a new album for Warner Bros., Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller), with no involvement from Cohen or Zappa. Following a lawsuit which was settled in 1982, the album remained unreleased until 2012, after Zappa's family had announced in 2011 that they would release the original Bat Chain Puller in its intended form. Background After recording the album Bongo Fury with Frank Zappa, Don Van Vliet formed a new Magic Band and began recording Bat Chain Puller for DiscReet and Virgin Records. Zappa described the proposed album as Vliet's best since Trout Mask Replica. Vliet co-produced it with Kerry McNab, who also served as the remix engineer on Zappa's album One Size Fits All. Herb Cohen, DiscReet's cofounder and Zappa's business manager, paid for the album's production costs with Zappa's royalty checks, leading Zappa to end his business partnership with Cohen. Cohen and Zappa each demanded to be paid an advance by Virgin, leading Zappa to withhold the master tapes, leading Cohen to sue Zappa. Due to the lawsuit, Vliet rerecorded the Bat Chain Puller tracks for Warner Bros. Records under the title Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). In 1982, Cohen settled his lawsuit with Zappa, while Vliet was recording Ice Cream for Crow. Vliet intended to use half of the tracks from the original Bat Chain Puller album on Ice Cream For Crow, but Zappa refused Vliet's request. Vliet biographer Mike Barnes subsequently claimed that Vliet did not want the original album to be released. On June 24, 2011, six months after Vliet's death, Zappa's widow Gail claimed that the original Bat Chain Puller would be released \\"[t]his year. December most likely\\"; in December it was announced for release on January 15, 2012, but was delayed and did not ship until February.

It was commissioned by Carl Friedrich Hensler, the Director of Vienna's new Theater in der Josefstadt, and was first performed at the theatre's opening on October 3, 1822. It was the first work Beethoven wrote after his revival of studying the works of J. S. Bach and Handel, and bears their influence. The Consecration of the House overture was also the first item on the program at Beethoven‚Äôs 7 May 1824 concert at Vienna‚Äôs Theater am K√§rntnertor, where the world premiere of his 9th Symphony took place. Composition history Previously, in 1811, Beethoven had written The Ruins of Athens (Die Ruinen von Athen), Op. 113, incidental music for August von Kotzebue's play of the same name, for the dedication of a new theatre in Pest. This same work was to be performed again in 1822 for the new theatre in Vienna. However, Carl Meisl, the commissioner of the Royal Imperial Navy, changed the texts of numbers 1, 6, 7, and 8 of Beethoven's work. Beethoven was not pleased with the revision, and felt that the new text did not fit the music. Meisl also introduced a section, Wo sich die Pulse, for which Beethoven wrote new music (WoO 98). Beethoven wrote a completely new overture for the work, altered some of the musical numbers, and added others, including a final chorus with violin solo and ballet. This new overture is known as The Consecration of the House Overture. (The extra incidental pieces constitute the entire work.) Structure of the overture An anecdote by Anton Schindler describes Beethoven conceiving two themes for the overture while on a walk, and relates the composer's intention of treating one of these in contrapuntal fashion after Handel. Beethoven chose a monothematic structure, in which a modulation occurs, but in which the new key features the same theme. This suggests the influence of Haydn. The overture opens with brief isolated chords which herald the beginning of a slow introduction in the manner of Handel. A slow march ensues, processional in character, as if heard in the distance. The brass and winds take over the theme and are joined by the strings for a repeat of the march. As the imaginary procession approaches, the march intensifies, closing with trumpet fanfares and kettle drum announcing the arrival. A trumpet fanfare, with runs in the bassoon, and later the violins, appearing to describe the hurrying and excitement of the crowd, introduces a fast tutti section which seems to signal the main body of the overture, but which instead gives way to a sonata-allegro form. The trumpets and drums resume, leading to an interlude connecting finally with the body of the overture: a fugal Allegro (referred to by Schindler) at the work's centre, in both single and double counterpoint. Different groups of instruments enter in turn, producing a fugal texture. The theme appears in the first violins, flute, and oboe, and a counter theme in the second violins and clarinets. This section crescendos rapidly, and ‚Äì following the recapitulation ‚Äì a forceful coda brings the overture to a brilliant close. Movements The overture described above, Beethoven's Op. 124, is the first piece in the list below. The other movements are sections that Beethoven wrote, or adapted from his other works, and that come under the umbrella name of this work.

He was originally drafted by the Washington Redskins in the fifth round of the 1997 NFL Draft. He played college football at Stanford University. High school career Badger attended Corvallis High School in Corvallis, Oregon and starred in football, basketball, and baseball. He was an All-American selection and rated Oregon's best prospect by Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report at Corvallis High School. In six games as a senior tight end, he had 12 receptions for 260 yards and three touchdowns. As a junior, he earned honorable mention All-State honors, catching 18 passes for 252 yards and a score. Badger also lettered in baseball and basketball. He was named honorable mention All-State in basketball as a junior and first team All-State in his senior year at center. College career At Stanford University, Badger was converted from a tight end into an offensive lineman. He was a three-year starter for the Cardinal, starting 34 of 35 games dating back to his sophomore year. As a senior, he was named to the All Pac-10 first-team. Professional career =1997 NFL Combine and Draft= Badger was invited to the 1997 NFL Combine held at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. Badger's 20-yard shuttle time of 4.13 seconds was the fastest of any offensive lineman that year, and to this day is still the fastest time by any offensive guard or tackle officially timed at the NFL Combine, having only been matched in 2017 by Jessamen Dunker of Tennessee State. Initially projected to be a late first day selection, Badger was drafted in the fifth round on day two of the 1997 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. =Washington Redskins (1997-1999)= Badger started the season opener in his rookie season at right guard against the Carolina Panthers. He filled in for starter Tre Johnson, who was recovering from off-season shoulder surgery. In that start, Badger helped the Redskins to 198 rushing yards, their third- highest output of the season. He finished the season as a reserve, playing in 12 games. In Badger's second season, offensive line coach and former Redskins all-pro guard Russ Grimm and head coach Norv Turner, shuffled the offensive line around and moved Badger to left tackle. After ten starts at left tackle, Badger was moved back inside to left guard. He started all 16 games in 1998. In year three for Badger in DC, he was primarily used as a backup at offensive guard. He played in 14 games, missing 2 with an ankle injury, and started 4 games. =Minnesota Vikings (2000-2001)= After playing for the Redskins for three seasons, Badger was signed by the Minnesota Vikings as a restricted free agent on April 10, 2000. The Redskins chose to not match the Vikings offer, and received a fifth round pick as compensation from the Vikings. Badger played exclusively as a backup in 2000 for the Vikings. In 2001, he moved into the starting lineup after longtime incumbent Todd Steussie was released for cap considerations. Badger started 12 of 13 games at tackle, while battling injuries throughout the season. =Oakland Raiders (2002-2006)= On April 11, 2002, Badger was signed to a one year deal as an unrestricted free agent by the Oakland Raiders. Badger played exclusively as a backup in 2002, however he did appear in Super Bowl XXXVII where the Raiders were defeated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In his second season with the Raiders, Badger appeared in all 16 games at guard, starting 11 of them. In five seasons playing for the Raiders, Badger played in 62 games, starting 31 of them. Badger was released by the Raiders on April 21, 2007. =Arizona Cardinals (2007)= After early pre-season injuries occurred on the Arizona Cardinals offensive line, the Cardinals needed to bolster there roster and Badger was signed on August 14, 2007. Badger was released by the Arizona Cardinals on September 10, 2007. As a vested veteran, the Cardinals would have been required to guarantee Badger's salary if he remained on the week one roster. Badger was quickly re-signed on September 13, 2007. He was cut again by the Arizona Cardinals on October 30, 2007. Personal life Badger is married to the former Mercedes Cisneros, daughter of Henry Cisneros. They dated and met at Stanford University. The couple have two daughters named Karina and Natalia.

Education Hignell was educated at Denstone College, a boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational), in the village of Denstone in Staffordshire in Central England, followed by Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. Hignell won Blues at Cambridge in both cricket and rugby union, and when he graduated in 1977 he had already made several England appearances at full back.Optima - The Fitzwilliam College Journal No 8, Autumn 2005, p6 He was the second man to captain Cambridge at both cricket and rugby union. Sporting career Hignell made his England rugby union debut in 1975 in a brutal encounter with Australia in Brisbane - eight days later he was playing for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Bristol and five weeks later he made 60 in the Varsity match. After leaving university, he continued playing rugby for Bristol and England in the winter, while also working as a teacher (including at Bristol Cathedral School and Sherborne School), and cricket for Gloucestershire in the summer. As a right-handed batsman, he scored solidly rather than spectacularly, passing 1,000 runs in a season three times, including his final season in 1983, before his retirement. He won the last of his 14 England rugby caps in 1978-79. Journalism Hignell continued to teach until he moved into journalism full-time and he became a respected reporter, as well as working extensively on BBC Radio. In 1999, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and has since been an active fundraiser. His final commentary for BBC Radio Five Live was the 2007-08 Guinness Premiership Final at Twickenham, where Wasps beat Leicester Tigers 26-16\\\\. Retiring Wasps captain Lawrence Dallaglio dedicated the victory to Hignell. Later in 2008 he provided weekly rugby podcasts on the This is Bristol website. Charity work Alastair Hignell became Patron of Multiple Sclerosis UK (MS-UK) (formally Multiple Sclerosis Resource Centre) in 2002 and has since been active in raising funds for the charity. In 2008, inspired by Alastair's heroic achievements on and off the pitch, Higgy's Heroes, a fundraising body linked to MS-UK was created. Initially a one-off idea by a group of ex-teammates and opponents who decided to run the London Marathon in tribute to Hignell, the name and the idea continued beyond this one event. Since then there have been a number of Higgy's Heroes fundraising events largely based on physical achievements or sports activities. These include participants at the London Marathon and a regular large turn out in Alastair's home town for the yearly Stroud Half Marathon.Stroud News and Journal Alastair moved to Brighton after living in Stroud for four years. Honours Hignell won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award in 2008 for his work in spreading awareness of multiple sclerosis. Hignell was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. He won the 'Best Rugby Book' category in the 2012 British Sports Book Awards for the book Higgy.

In 933 or 934, Eberhard, in view of his maternal Unruoching descendance, was offered the Iron Crown of Lombardy by supporters of King Rudolph II of Burgundy in the conflict with rivalling Hugh of Arles. After Rudolph himself had renounced all claims on the Italian throne, the Bavarian duke allied with Bishop Ratherius and marched against Verona, but the campaign failed. In 935, Eberhard was designated by his father as his heir to the duchy. Duke Arnulf reached the consent of King Henry the Fowler and also made the Bavarian nobility pay homage to his son at Reichenhall in July. At about this time, Eberhard married Liutgard. On his father's death, he succeeded without fanfare, but quickly came into conflict with Henry's son King Otto, who opposed the privileges won by late Duke Arnulf from his father.

This initiative is part of A&E;'s \\"Real Life, Real Change\\" social campaign that showcases innovative companies through TV vignettes on the network as well as a web presence for Spira on A&E;'s website and social media extensions. Spira raised more than $42,000 by pre-selling more than 800 pairs of the Stinger 2 shoes to supporter and enthusiasts through the RocketHub platform. The money was used to fund the purchase the initial run of inventory for the new shoe. In August 2013, Spira announced a line of officially licensed limited edition Duck Dynasty camouflage shoes. The company will introduce a running shoe that will feature the signature duck camouflage pattern sported by the Robertson family, who are the stars of the reality television series. The relationship between A&E;, RocketHub, and Spira Footwear started in the summer of 2012 when Spira used Rockethub‚Äôs service to crowdfund its line of Stinger2 shoes. With a crowdfunding project under their belt, Spira was chosen by A&E; to align with after the network brainstormed the idea to launch a shoe line for Duck Dynasty. Using the crowdfunding site gives Spira the opportunity to pre-sell the shoe allowing the company to anticipate demand and to determine proper inventory levels. This gives Spira increased visibility into the demand for the shoe so this smaller company can anticipate manufacturing needs with greater accuracy. =HealthWagers contest= In May 2013, Spira and HealthWagers announced a contest where a runner, who is wearing Spira shoes, completes a sanctioned chip-timed race, and the runner does not run faster than their personal record, Spira will pay them back for the price of their shoes. According to the rules of the contest, the race must be longer than and must completed in the foreseeable future. Research In 2014, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology conducted a research study on the impact of the Spira shoes and technology on running efficiency. The study used 17 runners to compare treadmill performance of two Spira models, one for training and the other for racing, to their own shoes.

April 23, 1941 in Jena, Thuringia) is a German nuclear chemist and astrophysicist. He is professor for nuclear chemistry at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz and adjunct professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. One of the main interests of Kratz is the study of nuclear structure of very neutron-rich isotopes. He concentrated on the beta-delayed neutron decay mode, especially the spectroscopy of the emitted neutrons. These isotopes are obtained by nuclear fission or proton induced spallation of heavy elements as uranium. In general, the extremely neutron-rich species of interest are produced together with an overwhelming amount of shorter-lived ones. Therefore he is developing chemical and physical separation techniques with very high chemical selectivity. These studies are performed in international collaborations at high-flux reactors (Institut Laue-Langevin, France) or accelerator facilities as the CERN in Switzerland or the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. The nuclear structure data are also applied by Kratz to nucleosynthesis, especially the astrophysical r-process. Elemental abundances from Supernova explosions are calculated in close collaboration with Friedrich-Karl Thielemann of the University of Basel. The calculated abundances are then compared to observed stellar abundances. Ultra- metal-poor Population II stars in the Galactic Halo exhibit a scaled-down Solar System r-process abundance pattern. Comparing calculated and observed abundances for elements as the stable europium with radioactive ones (thorium and uranium) the age of these stars can be determined to about 13 billion years (see Sneden's Star, Cayrel's Star, BD +17¬∞ 3248, HE 1523-0901). In 1999 he received the Nuclear Chemistry Award (now Glenn T. Seaborg Award) of the American Chemical Society. In 2014, the American Physical Society rewarded him the Hans A. Bethe Prize.

Mackey and the Strike Team protect local drug dealer Rondell Robinson by enforcing strict rules to make the streets safer. Aceveda works with the Justice Department to bring Detective Terry Crowley onto the Strike Team to try to gain evidence to use on Vic. However, Vic is aware of Crowley's involvement due to his friendship with the Assistant Chief of Police Ben Gilroy; when the Strike Team is forced to shoot and kill Two-Time, a drug dealer, Vic and Detective Shane Vendrell use Two-Time's gun to murder Crowley (without informing team members Detective Curtis \\"Lem\\" Lemansky and Detective Ronnie Gardocki), making it look like Crowley was killed by Two-Time.

Separately, rookie officer Julien Lowe learns the ropes from his training officer Danielle \\"Danny\\" Sofer, as well as tries to hide his homosexuality from the others. Julien witnesses the Strike Team smuggling a portion of a drug bust for their own personal wealth and reports this to Aceveda. When Aceveda starts investigating Julien's claims, Vic threatens to reveal Julien's homosexuality to the department. Julien backs out from his witness statement, leaving Aceveda with nothing to go on. Detective Holland \\"Dutch\\" Wagenbach and Detective Claudette Wyms hunt a serial killer targeting prostitutes while dealing with their own problems in The Barn. Vic, separately, has to deal with the growing rift between him and his wife Corrine, and learning his son Matthew is autistic, and uses his illicit police activities to pay for special schooling for him. Due to Vic's behavior, Corrine takes the children and disappears, leaving a note to Vic to not to come find them. =Season 2 (2003)= The Barn discovers that the Mexican drug gangs in Farmington are uniting under a new drug lord, Armadillo Quintero who is able to evade arrest due to lack of evidence and willing witnesses. Privately, the Strike Team learns that Armadillo has knowledge of some of their illicit activities and fear he will rat them out if he is taken to prison. They attempt to coerce Armadillo to return to Mexico by threatening to green light Armadillo's brother but Armadillo responds by having his brother murdered. Vic eventually loses his cool and burns half of Armadillo's face on stove burner only to have Armadillo do the same to Gardocki and use his new leverage against the Strike Team. With the fallout of Gilroy's arrest The Barn, Aceveda, and Vic all find themselves under scrutiny of an independent auditor who is determined to find any corruption in The Barn. As Vic and Aceveda struggle to stay one step ahead their tactics draw the ire of Claudette who is determined to arrest Armadillo after he rapes a young girl. Claudette, initially reluctant to take a leadership role, eventually agrees to take over as The Barn's Captain after realizing she can't stay neutral any more. Meanwhile, Danny fatally shoots a Muslim man who threatened her during a confrontation and Julien is unable to back her story. The widow threatens to sue the department and begins to create problems for Danny both professionally and personally. Shane and Lem convince a small-time criminal to kill Armadillo by passing him a knife after he is arrested and put into the cage by Danny. Separately, Vic has a private investigator search for Corrine and his kids, and eventually finds her seemingly preparing to file for divorce. He moves out of his home and preemptively files for divorce first as to have a better chance of retaining his parenting rights, but this only serves to widen the distance between them. As the Armadillo case is resolved, the Strike Team learn that the Armenian Mob have a \\"money train\\" that passes through Farmington every so often, a means for the mob to launder their illegal funds into untraceable cash. The Strike Team privately plans to rob the money train, knowing that they would be set financially should they succeed. The season ends with the successful execution of the money train heist, Danny being fired, and Aceveda winning the primary. =Season 3 (2004)= In the aftermath of the money train heist the Strike Team resolves to lay low and avoid any controversy but quickly find themselves marginalized and lacking vital information. When some of the money from the heist is revealed to be marked for a federal case the team struggles to stay ahead of Dutch who begins to gradually suspect Vic. The Armenian mob sends Margos Dezerian, previously seen in season one, to find the money and kill anyone with anyone involved. As Margos and the investigation closes in on the Strike Team, Lem burns a majority of the money in a desperate attempt to protect the team ultimately leading to a confrontation which causes the Strike Team to split up in the season finale. Claudette is promised a promotion to captain and maintains a supervising role throughout the season while Aceveda prepares to move on to the city council. Near the end of the season, a public defender is shot, and the ensuing investigation leads Claudette and Dutch to discover that the victim had been a heavy drug user for the past three years. Claudette, determined to ensure justice, explores further and becomes very unpopular with the D.A. and around the Barn because she reopens (against orders) the defender's lost cases. This results in her being denied the promotion to Captain of the Farmington District. Shane begins a serious relationship with Mara and eventually proposes to her when they find out she is pregnant. Mara encourages Shane to be more independent from Vic even after discovering the money from the heist. The conflict between Vic and Shane becomes personal by the end of the season leaving a deep rift between the two. Dutch opens a case of a serial rapist and finds himself becoming more obsessed than usual without Claudette's backing. Julien, after suffering a beating during the season 2 finale has toughened considerably leading Claudette feeling alarmed that he may wash out. Danny makes a deal with Aceveda to be reinstated provided to provide him any pertinent information about other officers. =Season 4 (2005)= Monica Rawling (Glenn Close) takes over the role as Farmington's new captain, who implements controversial federal asset forfeiture laws to seize any property tied to drug dealing, using the money to fund the department and give back to the community. The season deals with the fallout from the Strike Team's disbandment. Shane Vendrell, with new partner Armando \\"Army\\" Renta (Michael Pe√±a), enters into a dangerous situation when trying to control major drug lord Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson), and seemingly accepts an order to kill Vic Mackey. The police are outraged after two officers are kidnapped and subsequently found murdered. In the end, the Strike Team is re-formed and manages to put Antwon in prison. The season also deals with the controversial asset-forfeiture policies of the new captain; Julien Lowe's opposition to these policies; and City Councilman David Aceveda's dealing with the psychological aftermath of his sexual assault incident from the previous season. The season concludes with Capt. Rawling's losing her job over a dispute with the DEA. Other plots involve Claudette and Dutch's marginalization as detectives, because of Claudette's refusal to apologize to the DA for reopening the cases of a public defender discovered to have been a functioning drug addict. Claudette's moral stand results in many of the prosecutors' cases being overturned. This costs Claudette her shot at becoming the Farmington Captain. Dutch attempts to resolve the situation by making a back-room deal with the DA to \\"keep Claudette in line\\" and do favors for the office in return for breaking back into action. Ultimately, this causes a rift between Claudette and Dutch, in which Dutch confronts Claudette after she rebukes him for making the deal. =Season 5 (2006)= The season revolves around Internal Affairs Division Lt. Jon Kavanaugh's (Forest Whitaker) investigation of the Strike Team and one of the greatest threats the team has ever faced. As a result of Kavanaugh's turning one of Mackey's informants, IAD became aware of Lem's heroin theft and failure to report during the Antwon Mitchell investigation. Finding the heroin gave IAD sufficient evidence to arrest Lem, but Kavanaugh informs him about his theory of Terry Crowley's death and has Lem wear a wire to get evidence on the Strike Team. Lem is able to warn Mackey he is wired and Mackey uses it to embarrass IAD. Kavanaugh, applying pressure to the team in any way he can, finds out about Mackey's share of the money train haul. After Mackey sleeps with Kavanaugh's wife for further humiliation Kavanaugh arrests Lem and makes a deal with Mitchell. Mackey supports Lem and gets bail, while Vendrell worries Lem will give evidence against the team. The season concludes with Vendrell, fooled by Aceveda into believing Lem was going to turn on the Strike Team, murdering his friend and fellow team member with a hand grenade. Other plots include Dutch discovering Claudette has a chronic illness; Claudette's physical breaking point getting a killer from the past to confess; Steve Billings as the interim \\"jellyfish yes-man\\" Captain of the Barn; Sofer dealing with pregnancy and refusing to divulge the father's name; Julien training Tina, a pretty but inept rookie officer who Dutch has a crush on; and Claudette finally getting her opportunity for promotion to captain of the Barn, which she accepts on the sole condition that she gets to run the Barn her way. \\"Wins and Losses\\" This 15-minute mini-episode was produced between the fifth and sixth seasons, and initially released to various websites in February 2007 as a promotion for season six. It was later made available on the Season 5 DVD set. =Season 6 (2007)= Continuing directly after season 5, Mackey and the Strike Team are distraught over Lem's death. Kavanaugh refuses to let the case die and resorts to Mackey's tactics of planting evidence and coercing witnesses to lie about the Strike Team, especially Mackey. Dutch and Claudette begin to suspect Kavanaugh's integrity. Kavanaugh finally confesses to his actions and finds himself under arrest. The first half of the season deals with Mackey and Gardocki hunting and killing Guardo Lima, the Barn's main suspect in the murder of Lem. Vendrell, overcome by guilt, becomes reckless and suicidal and enters into an affair with a teenager associated with the new One-Niner boss. The last half of the season concludes with the breakdown of Mackey and Vendrell's friendship, as Vendrell admits having killed Lem. Vendrell threatens Mackey and Gardocki with revealing their illegal exploits should Mackey attempt to arrest him for Lem's killing. Vendrell tries to get protection with the Armenians and reveals Mackey was the ringleader behind the money train robbery putting Mackey's family in danger. Mackey learns from Claudette that the Chief plans to force him into early retirement and his attempts to make himself indispensable. After a bloody mass murder, Claudette learns the Barn could be shut down if no improvements are made by the time quarterly crime statistics are released. Julien joins the Strike Team under the leadership of a new and ineffective leader. Aceveda finds a new backer for his mayoral campaign but soon learns he might be in over his head. Dutch's relationship with Tina becomes complicated following meddling by Billings. In the final minutes of the season's last episode, Aceveda and Mackey agree to work together to take down Aceveda's new backers. =Season 7 (2008)= Mackey and Aceveda agree to work together to stop Cruz Pezuela, a developer acting as a front man for a Mexican cartel and a major backer of Acevada‚Äôs mayoral ambitions. Vic spins it into a gang war between the Mexicans and Armenians as a way to protect himself and his family after Vendrell outed him to the Armenians as the man who robbed their money laundering operation. As the gang war spins out of control, Vic begins to cozy up to ICE Agent Olivia Murray as a way to bring more weight down on the cartel and to secure an ICE position for himself and Ronnie along with complete immunity for their past crimes. Shane, despite holding his written confession as leverage over Vic and Ronnie, agrees to help stop the Armenian threat in order to protect his own family. At an arranged meeting between the Mexicans and Armenians, Vic and Ronnie tamper with Shane‚Äôs sidearm in an attempt to get him killed in revenge for Lem‚Äôs death. Shane escapes and hires a small-time enforcer to perform simultaneous hits on Vic and Ronnie. The attempt fails forcing Shane to go on the run with Mara and Jackson forcing Vic to give up his badge in order to catch and kill Shane and Mara. Mara uses Vendrell‚Äôs leverage against Mackey to coerce Corrine into serving as a middleman to help her family escape the police. After Mackey fails in attempt to kill Vendrell and Mara using Corrine‚Äôs information, Corrine contacts the Barn and agrees to help stop Vic as long as he never learns of her involvement. Dutch and Wyms begin a full-scale investigation into Vic and Ronnie in a final attempt to take down the Strike Team members once and for all. After a failed attempt to get Vic in the act of aiding and abetting a fugitive, Wyms fakes the arrest of Corrine in order to preserve her cover. Vic, thinking he needs to protect Corrine, leverages the bust of the Mexican cartel into a full immunity for himself and Corrine foregoing Ronnie‚Äôs deal despite promising Ronnie they‚Äôd run together if things fell apart. As part of his deal with ICE, Vic confesses to all the crimes he and Strike Team committed stunning Olivia, her boss, as well as Wyms and Dutch. Wyms, her health still deteriorating, nearly breaks down upon learning Vic is now immune. As a small bit of revenge and to protect Corrine, Wyms and Dutch arrange for Oliva to get Corrine and her kids into federal witness protection. When Vic gloats to Shane about his new deal Shane reveals Corrine betrayed him to Wyms and Dutch as a way to prove Shane was always the better husband and father. Vic and Ronnie lead the cartel and the leadership of the black gangs into an ICE trap which Aceveda uses as a publicity stunt for his mayoral campaign. Out of options, Shane poisons Mara and Jackson and shoots himself after writing out his confession as Wyms and her team arrive to arrest him. The Barn informs Vic of Shane‚Äôs suicide, when Mackey arrives Wyms places him in an interrogation room and confronts him with the fallout of all his actions. Unable to do anything more to Vic, Wyms orders Dutch and Julian to arrest Ronnie publicly for all the crimes Vic confessed to. Ronnie, shocked, screams that Vic betrayed him and killed the team. The series ends with Corrine and her children in witness protection. Wyms admits to Dutch she‚Äôs dying but will remain Captain as long as she can. Olivia informs Vic of his new position writing reports at a desk for ICE, when Vic argues it wasn‚Äôt the terms he agreed to Olivia reminds him any step out of line to the word of their agreement will violate his immunity. At the end of the show Vic at the ICE office after hours putting pictures of his children and of himself and Lem on his new desk. After hearing police sirens he pauses for a moment before grabbing his gun and leaving.

Being 8 km long and 1.3 km wide at maximum, as well as having an area of 38.84 km¬≤, it was a brackish natural lake until 1963, when it was turned into a reservoir with the construction of a dam to secure fresh water for the large Neftochim Burgas oil refinery. The rivers Izvorska, Fakiyska, Sredetska and Rusokastrenska flow into the lake. Parts of Lake Mandrensko are designated protected areas, Poda and Uzungeren, inhabited by a number of locally and globally endangered species of fish and birds.  Name and history  Old names of the lake are K√∂rfes, Ahrenslijsko marsh and Yazekliysko lake. The name K√∂rfes comes from the Turkish k√∂rfez and means bay. Under this name the lake was found in 1493, which is an important indication that the lake itself was used as a port. In 1884, Konstantin Jireƒçek described the lake, 10 km long and 1-2 km wide, as an open estuary with low but constant flow. In summer and autumn, and especially in easterly winds, the salinity increased. According to a report by Prof. Bonchev from 1912, it had an area of 16.5 km2 and was smaller than Lake Burgas. The report also indicates a depth at the Poda canal of 5 meters, while in the western part it reached only 70-80 cm. In 1963 the dam wall was built, which turned most of the lake into a freshwater dam and increased its area nearly 4 times.  Geography  The lake is the southernmost and largest of the four Burgas lakes with a water surface area of about 1300 hectares. Its length is 8 km, maximum width 1.3 km. It is located in a well-formed river valley, oriented transversely to the sea shore, as the mouth and the dam wall are in close proximity to the southern end of Bourgas. Four rivers flow into the lake: Izvorska, Fakiyska, Sredetska and Rusokastrenska. The lake was preserved in its natural state until 1934, when corrections were made to some of the rivers and dikes were built in its western part to prevent spring floods. The second major change in the lake occurred in 1963, with the construction of a dam in its eastern part. In this way, part of the shallows overgrown with swamp vegetation were destroyed, the connection of the lake with the sea was cut off and it became completely freshwater. The large reed massifs disappear, and with them the convenient nesting places for herons, pelicans, ducks, etc. species of waterfowl. In this way the only colony of pink pelicans in Bulgaria was destroyed.  Flora and fauna  Some parts of the lake have been declared protected areas (part of the mouth of the estuary-protected area \\"Poda\\", with an area of 107 ha, the mouth of the river Izvorska - with an area of 151 ha, \\"Uzungeren\\" - with an area of 210 ha. The other lakes of the Mandra coast cover the northernmost slopes of Strandzha, with characteristic forest vegetation - cyclamen, wild peony, snowdrop, crocus and others. The most interesting are the birds on the lake and the shore, where over 250 species have been found. Among them as globally endangered are the little cormorant, the Dalmatian pelican, the red- breasted goose, the thorny-tailed grebe, the meadow woodpecker. The most important nesting place for birds is \\"Poda\\", the coastal meadows, the sandy shores - for the blue, the bee-eater, the red angel and others. The winter concentrations of the brown-headed and hooded diver, the song swan and the little swan are the highest in the country and second in terms of the great white-fronted goose and the red-breasted goose. Due to this fact, Mandra is an ornithologically important place of European importance. Of the mammals in the area, otter and squirrel populations are best preserved. Another value of the lake are its fish stocks and waterfowl. A total of 5 species of fish from the Red Book of Bulgaria have been identified in the lake.

Nicol√≤ Gabrielli composed the triumphal march Sim√≥n Bol√≠var to celebrate the 100th anniversary of El Libertador's birth (1883) Biography Born in Naples, at the time when the city was capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Nicol√≤ Gabrielli was the scion of a distinguished yet decayed aristocratic family originally from Gubbio and settled thereafter in Tropea and Palermo. He showed since his early childhood a talent for music that led him to enter the Naples conservatory where he studied under the supervision of Nicola Zingarelli and Gaetano Donizetti. He dedicated himself especially to musical composition, and debuted in August 1835 with a melodrama in Neapolitan dialect, I dotti per fanatismo. Nicol√≤ Gabrielli was a very prolific composer, and from 1835 onwards worked at many melodramas, opera buffas, commedias and farsas, including La lettera perduta (1836), Il Cid (1836), La parola di matrimonio (1837), L'americano in fiera ossia Farvest Calelas (1837), Vinclinda (1837), L'affamato senza danaro (1839), Edwige o Il sogno (1839), Il padre della debuttante (1839), La marchesa e il ballerino (1839), Nadan o L'orgoglio punito (1839), L'assedio di Sciraz ossia L'amor materno (1840), Basilio III Demetriovitz (1841), Il bugiardo veritiero (1841), Il condannato di Saragozza (1842), La zingara (1842), Carlo di Rovenstein (1843), L'assedio di Leyda (1843), Sara ovvero La pazza delle montagne di Scozia (1843), Il gemello (1845), Una passeggiata sul palchetto a vapore verso Capri (1845), Giulia di Tolosa (1846), Il vampiro (1848), Bradamante e Ruggero (1849), Fiorina (1849), La regina delle rose (1850). He also worked at several ballets, including Ester d'Engaddi (1837), Il rajah di Benares (1839), that, similarly to other later works, was composed and represented in occasion of the birthday of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, Amore alla prova (1839), Il duca di Ravenna (1841), Giaffar (1841), Olga di Cracovia (1841), L'istituto delle fanciulle (1841), Il gobbo del Giappone (1841), La conquista del Messico (1842), Erissena (1845), L'orfanella africana (1845), Merope (1846), Alcidoro (1847), Ifigenia in Aulide (1847), Il trionfo d'amore (1848), Olema (1848), Paquita (1848), Gisella (1849), I Candiano (1849), Schariar ovvero Le mille e una notte (1849), Mocanna (1850), La stella del marinajo (1851). Other ballets were Le spose veneziane and Stefano re di Napoli. In 1840 he was appointed musical director of the Royal Theatre of San Carlo in Naples, a position that enabled him to travel all over Italy and abroad and make acquaintance with the international society. In 1854 he was invited by Napoleon III to join the imperial court in Paris, where he debuted at the Op√©ra with a ballet, Gemma (1854, libretto by Th√©ophile Gautier and choreography by former ballerina Fanny Cerrito). Other works followed, including I paggi del Conte di Provenza (1856), (1856), La ninfa Cloe (1857), (1859), Melissa, ossia I viaggiatori all'isola incantata (1859), (1860), (1861), Les memoirs de Fanchette (1865). His last work to be represented in a theatre was (1865). The popularity of the comte Gabrielli, as he was known in the aristocratic and artistic circles du tout Paris, gradually decreased after the fall of Napoleon III and the advent of the Third French Republic. A staunch Bonapartist, he went into semi-secluded retirement in his Paris apartment, but still composed the military march Simon Bol√≠var (1883), and dedicated it to the President of Venezuela, Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco. A cantique composed by Nicol√≤ Gabrielli was adopted by the Protestant communities of the French-speaking part of Switzerland as their unofficial hymn, and was later included in the work Chants populaires de Suisse romande pour voix mixtes, published at Geneva in 1887. Nicol√≤ Gabrielli was appointed Knight of the French Legion of Honor and Knight of the Spanish Order of Charles III, both in 1864. He died in Paris in 1891 and was buried in the Montparnasse cemetery. His remains were later moved to the P√®re Lachaise cemetery in the eastern part of the French capital.

According to the Church of Scientology: Dianetics and Clearing Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the general public in April 1950, in an article published in the Astounding Science Fiction pulp magazine, and followed quickly with the book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health that same summer. Dianetics postulates that there is a part of our psyche called the reactive mind, and that most of our mental and physical problems are psychosomatic, thus they can be solved by eliminating this portion of our minds. This mental state of self-mastery is called Clear. In the 1992 Hardcover edition of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, Hubbard writes: \\"A Clear, for instance, has complete recall of everything which ever happened to him, or anything he ever studied. He does mental computations, such as those in chess, for example, which a normal would do in half an hour, in ten or fifteen seconds.\\" (p. 214). Exteriorization of energy Speaking on the subject of \\"Exteriorization - communication in Theta and MEST\\", Hubbard said that an individual thetan (person) has the ability to generate electricity by putting a \\"beam\\" inside a vacuum tube, or a bell jar that has had the air evacuated: Spiritual immortality The \\"immortality\\" referred to is not immortality of the body, but of the thetan, and Scientology does not claim that it causes the thetan's immortality, but makes a Scientologist aware of that immortality and alleviates the distress that might otherwise be felt at the prospect of death: Enhanced health and lifespan On page 121 of the 1992 Hardcover edition of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, Hubbard writes: \\"Clears do not get colds.\\" It is also hinted that achieving the state of Clear prolongs lifespan: \\"What the lifespan of a Clear is cannot be answered now; ask in a hundred years.\\" (p. 384) Increasing body weight Hubbard has claimed on numerous occasions that it is possible for Scientologists to use mind over matter to increase one's body weight, although why someone would specifically want to do this is not explained. In his book Understanding the E-meter, Hubbard wrote that this assertion can be tested by \\"mocking up\\" mental pictures in one's imagination. \\"This test has actually been made and an increase of as much as thirty pounds, actually measured on scales, has been added to and subtracted from a body by creating 'mental energy.'\\" (p. 52) In December 1954, Hubbard declared before a crowd at a lecture: In 1957, Hubbard claimed that he was contacted by physicists from a scientific congress in Boston: \\"They wanted to know if I had any proof I could offer that thought created matter\\". Hubbard said he gave them all his data about using Scientology's mental \\"mock-ups\\" to increase body weight, and reported \\"I got back a highly enthusiastic wire saying that my data, as sent to them, had been of great assistance.\\" (Ability Congress, 2nd lecture, December 1957) Touch assists Scientologists (especially Volunteer Ministers) are taught to administer the \\"Touch Assist\\", a procedure designed by Hubbard to help heal illnesses or injuries. The Scientologist touches the person's body in a set manner, avoiding sexual areas, and asks the recipient of the process, who is lying or sitting still, to \\"Feel my finger\\". This is continued until the recipient states that he feels better about what was bothering him and looks more cheerful overall. The process is claimed to help restore the spiritual being's (thetan in Scientology terminology) ability to communicate with the affected area and thereby to speed healing and reduce mental trauma. The touch assist is not to be used to treat headaches, however: \\"Do not do a Touch Assist on a person who has a headache. Research has shown that headaches are often the result of mental phenomena that a Touch Assist would be the incorrect handling for.\\" (The Scientology Handbook, 1994 edition, p. 218) It is probably the most well-known of all Scientology Assists, which also include the \\"Nerve Assist\\" and the \\"Unconscious Person Assist\\". Theta perceptics The Super Power Building in Florida, where the Super Power Rundown, intended to enhance one's \\"Theta Perceptics\\", will be given upon completion. Scientology promises the ability to hone one's \\"theta perceptics\\" (senses of the thetan rather than the physical \\"meat body\\") and promises \\"Communication with the theta universe\\" with enhanced 'perceptics' such as \\"hunches, predictions, ESP at greater and lesser distances, communication with the dead, perception of the Supreme Being, etc.\\" (Science of Survival, 50th anniversary edition, 2001, p. 576.) Hubbard claims that humans have precisely 57 of these 'perceptics'. The Super Power Rundown is intended to amplify these latent abilities of the thetan by way of becoming hyper-aware of the physical \\"meat body\\". These 'perceptics' are: > Time, Sight; Taste, Color, Depth; Solidity (barriers); Relative sizes > (external); Sound; Pitch; Tone; Volume; Rhythm; Smell; Touch (pressure, > friction, heat or cold and oiliness); Personal emotion; Endocrine states; > Awareness of awareness; Personal size; Organic sensation (including hunger); > Heartbeat; Blood circulation; Cellular and bacterial position; Gravitic > (self and other weights); Motion of self; Motion (exterior); Body position; > Joint position; Internal temperature; External temperature; Balance; > Muscular tension; Saline content of self (body); Fields/magnetic; Time track > motion; Physical energy (personal weariness, etc.); Self-determinism; > Moisture (self); Sound direction; Emotional state of other organs; Personal > position on the tone scale; Affinity (self and others); Communication (self > and others); Reality (self and others); Emotional state of groups; Compass > direction; Level of consciousness; Pain; Perception of conclusions (past and > present); Perception of computation (past and present); Perception of > imagination (past and present); Perception of having perceived (past and > present); Awareness of not knowing; Awareness of importance, unimportance; > Awareness of others; Awareness of location and placement (masses, spaces and > location itself); Perception of appetite; Kinesthesia. The Church describes the Super Power Rundown as \\"A super fantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anybody whether Dn Clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing Super Power of a thetan. This means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create a new world.\\" (Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary, 1982 hardcover edition) The exact nature of these \\"Super Powers\\" have not yet been enumerated, at least to the public. Scientology researcher Martin Hunt says that the Super Power Rundown is \\"expected to make planetary clearing and the expanding of all service organizations to the size of old Saint Hill a reality\\". This refers to a directive issued by the Church that their primary goal must be to expand the size of all Scientology service organizations to the size that Saint Hill was in the 1960s - in other words, more than 200 staff members in each organization. The Super Power Building is currently under construction in Clearwater, Florida for the purpose of administering this rundown. However, it has been plagued with construction setbacks since its initial groundbreaking in 1998. Telepathy and remote viewing Two Scientologists, Hal Puthoff and Ingo Swann, researched remote viewing at Stanford Research Institute for the CIA Project Stargate in the 1970s. Most of the SRI team, including project director Puthoff, and the CIA's star \\"psychic spies\\", Price and Swann, were Scientologists, a fact that skeptic Martin Gardner noted disparagingly. Puthoff and Swann were of the \\"original\\" Operating Thetan (OT) VII level (the Church has since 'changed' OT VII from the level these two completed), and credited Scientology with their success in the CIA remote viewing program.CST and the CIA , Church of Spiritual Technology From the book What is Scientology?: \\"Can OTs read minds? ...to answer the question bluntly - yes, with varying degrees of ability\\". (First printing, 1978, p. 215) Independent creation of perception In Scientology 8-8008, Hubbard states that Scientology training can make one aware of one's ability to turn illusions into MEST reality, and that even a preclear is \\"capable of producing illusions sufficiently strong to be observable by others\\".Hubbard, Scientology 8-8008, 1990 edition, p. 155. Hubbard speaks of \\"rehabilitating\\" the preclear so that he \\"begins to recognize that his viewpoint is expanding and that he is becoming all- pervasive\\", and then goes on to say: Cleared Theta Clear Beyond even the powerful Operating Thetan levels comes \\"Cleared Theta Clear,\\" a state which Hubbard describes this way: References =Lectures by Hubbard= * 3rd ACC.

Outflowing capital can be caused by any number of economic or political reasons but can often originate from instability in either sphere. Regardless of cause, capital outflowing is generally perceived as always undesirable and many countries create laws to restrict the movement of capital out of the nations' borders (called capital controls). While this can aid in temporary growth, it often causes more economic problems than it helps. # Massive capital outflow is usually a sign of a greater problem, not the problem itself. # Countries with outflow restrictions can find it harder to attract capital inflows because firms know if an opportunity goes sour they won't be able to recover much of their investment. # Governments that institute capital controls inevitably send a signal to their citizens that something might be wrong with the economy, even if the laws are merely a precautionary measure. Argentina experienced rampant and sudden capital outflows in the 1990s after its currency underwent dramatic pressure to adjust in light of the fixed exchange rate, leading to a recession. Modern macro- economists often cite the country as a classic example of the difficulties of developing fledgling economies. See also * Capital account * Capital flight References * Blustein, Paul.

Businesses that he owned included Creditanstalt and the Northern Railway.  Personal life  Born in Vienna, he was the youngest son of Anselm von Rothschild (1803‚Äì1874) and Charlotte von Rothschild (1807‚Äì1859). Known in the family as \\"Salbert,\\" he was educated in Vienna and Br√ºnn/Brno. On his father's death in 1874, brothers Nathaniel and Ferdinand inherited most of their parents real estate and art collection. However, the family business passed to Albert including the S M von Rothschild bank, the single largest shareholding in the Creditanstalt, and the shares in the Northern Railway. After two generations in Austria, communications between his family and the Rothschilds in England had diminished considerably but Albert wisely reinstated the regular exchange of vital information on current economic matters and politics in their respective countries. In 1876, Albert von Rothschild married Baroness Bettina Caroline de Rothschild (1858‚Äì1892) of Paris, France, daughter of Alphonse James de Rothschild. They had seven children. Their firstborn was Georg von Rothschild (March 22, 1877 - January 10, 1934). He never married and died in a private mental hospital. The youngest, Oskar von Rothschild (1888‚Äì1909), never married and at age 21 committed suicide. Georg and Oskar are buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna. Albert von Rothschild owned several large properties including the Palais Albert Rothschild at Prinz-Eugen-Stra√üe 20-22, in the IV. district Wieden district of Vienna designed by the French architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur and built between 1876 and 1882. In December 1887, Albert and his wife were given the right to be presented at Court, the first time such a privilege had been granted in Austria to Jews. Albert continued the family's involvement in the arts and with philanthropic projects. He was a chess patron who helped to finance the Vienna tournaments of 1873, 1882, 1898, 1903 (Gambit) and 1908. He was also President of the Vienna Chess Association 1872-1883 and a strong amateur player. He took a special interest in institutions that provided assistance to Jewish artists and musicians. Following his wife's death in 1892 at the age of thirty-four, in her memory Albert von Rothschild built the Bettina Frauenspital (Bettina Hospital for Women) and a Bettina Rothschild begonia was named for her. The Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa named the large Main belt asteroid he discovered in 1885 the 250 Bettina in her honor as a benefactor of the Vienna Observatory. Albert was awarded the Iron Cross of Merit in 1893 for his role in Austro- Hungarian monetary reform. When his unmarried and childless brother Nathaniel died in 1905, Albert inherited his Palais Nathaniel Rothschild at 14-16 Theresianumgasse in Vienna along with its large collection of art. Albert Salomon von Rothschild died in Vienna on February 11, 1911 and was interred next to his wife and their six-year-old daughter Charlotte in the city's Zentralfriedhof. In recognition of Albert von Rothschild's years of financial support, the 719 Albert Amor asteroid was named in his memory by astronomer Johann Palisa.

Family His father was David Shapinsky (born circa 1896), a \\"cutter\\" in the garment trades. His mother, Alice Wolfe Shapinsky (born circa 1902), was very young when they met in the subway, according to some family stories. Both David and Alice were born in eastern Europe and came to the United States in the early part of the century. They had four sons; Aaron (December 8, 1919 ‚Äì March 1984), Murray (d. February 1970), Harold, and Buck. Young Harold was a gifted artist. Unfortunately, the family endured a bitter divorce, and afterwards his mother married Alex Matos, originally from Puerto Rico. Neither his mother nor his stepfather supported the young Harold's aspirations. Early life He struggled very much on his own, occasionally assisted by his brothers. He had several breakdowns along the way. In one instance, he was not eating properly and had no money, became sick and was thrown out of his apartment. His paintings were thrown into the street. Some were rescued by his brother Aaron. Some of his early work was destroyed by his parents or painted over by his stepfather. While Harold Shapinsky ultimately found some encouragement from a circle of artists that would be known as the \\"New York School\\" of abstract expressionism, he became an associate of Jackson Pollock. Marriage Shapinsky met and married modern dancer Katherine \\"Kate\\" Peters (March 16, 1920 ‚Äì January 22, 2005), the daughter of Frazier Forman and Katherine Harrower Peters. The two were both considered black sheep by their families. They had one child, David Frazier Shapinsky, born 1960. Fame In 1985, an Indian professor of English, Akumal Ramachander, met Harold's son in Chicago purely by circumstance. The son, David, uncharacteristically showed Akumal slides of Harold's work. Ramachander decided to promote the artist claiming that exposing Shapinsky to the world stage was part of his personal destiny. He contacted Lawrence Weschler, a writer at The New Yorker, and helped organize Shapinsky's first one-man show, at London's Mayor Gallery.Lawrence Weschler, Shapinsky's Karma (1985) As a result, Shapinsky became a 'revived artist' as an abstract impressionist. He spent the next 15 years in relative comfort from some resulting sales. To date, Shapinsky's works have garnered international renown; some reside at the Tate, presented anonymously by the Mayor Gallery. Last years In 2001, when his wife could no longer care for him, as he was suffering from Alzheimer's dementia along with blindness, he was moved to Collingswood Nursing Home near Rockville, Maryland. His wife then moved to Friendship Terrace, a retirement community in Washington, D.C. By this time, the couple had no resources to speak of, despite his past fame, and their care cost was largely met by their son. Shapinsky died at the age of 78 on January 31, 2004. His wife died the following year on January 22, 2005. Both are buried together at the Garden of Remembrance Cemetery in Maryland.

The central product is similar to the direct product, but in the central product two isomorphic central subgroups of the smaller groups are merged into a single central subgroup of the product. Central products are an important construction and can be used for instance to classify extraspecial groups. Definition There are several related but distinct notions of central product. Similarly to the direct product, there are both internal and external characterizations, and additionally there are variations on how strictly the intersection of the factors is controlled. A group G is an internal central product of two subgroups H, K if (1) G is generated by H and K and (2) every element of H commutes with every element of K . Sometimes the stricter requirement that H ‚à© K is exactly equal to the center is imposed, as in . The subgroups H and K are then called central factors of G. The external central product is constructed from two groups H and K, two subgroups H1 ‚â§ Z(H), K1 ‚â§ Z(K), and a group isomorphism Œ∏:H1 ‚Üí K1. The external central product is the quotient of the direct product H √ó K by the normal subgroup N = { ( h, k ) : h in H1, k in K1, and Œ∏(h)‚ãÖk = 1 }, . Sometimes the stricter requirement that H1 = Z(H) and K1 = Z(K) is imposed, as in . An internal central product is isomorphic to an external central product with H1 = K1 = H ‚à© K and Œ∏ the identity. An external central product is an internal central product of the images of H √ó 1 and 1 √ó K in the quotient group (H\\\\times K) / N. This is shown for each definition in and . Note that the external central product is not in general determined by its factors H and K alone. The isomorphism type of the central product will depend on the isomorphism Œ∏. It is however well defined in some notable situations, for example when H and K are both finite extra special groups and H_1 = Z(H) and K_1 = Z(K). Examples * The Pauli group is the central product of the cyclic group C_4 and the dihedral group D_4. * Every extra special group is a central product of extra special groups of order p3. * The layer of a finite group, that is, the subgroup generated by all subnormal quasisimple subgroups, is a central product of quasisimple groups in the sense of Gorenstein. Applications The representation theory of central products is very similar to the representation theory of direct products, and so is well understood, . Central products occur in many structural lemmas, such as which is used in George Glauberman's result that finite groups admitting a Klein four group of fixed-point-free automorphisms are solvable.

It is a member of the federation Scouting in Luxembourg and of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. The Association is open to all boys and girls without discrimination to race, religion or nationality. Its spiritual ideals are based on Christian beliefs and are recognized by the Catholic Church. The association has about 5,000 members organized in 60 local groups. History Catholic Scouting in Luxembourg started in 1913; six years later the Catholic Scout groups founded the F√©d√©ration Nationale des Scouts du Luxembourg (National Scout Federation of Luxembourg, FNSL). Catholic Guiding did not start until 1938, when the Catholic Luxembourg Girl Guides (CLGS) was founded. In 1945, the FNSL and the F√©d√©ration Nationale des Eclaireurs du Luxembourg formed the Luxembourg Boy Scouts Association (now Scouting in Luxembourg); thus the FNSL became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. A second umbrella federation for Girl Guides was formed in 1960, when the CLGS and the Association des Girl Guides Luxembourgeoises (AGGL) founded the Bureau de Liaison des Associations Guides du Luxembourg upon which membership in the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts was transferred. In 1979, Nicolas Hosch was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. In 1994, the FNSL and the CLGS merged and, together, became known as L√´tzebuerger Guiden a Scouten. The LGS became a full member of WAGGGS in 2017 following the closing down of the AGGL in 2014. Program International activities are an important part of the Scout program. About 90% of the CaraPio summer camps are held abroad. The older members are involved in several development projects in Senegal, Niger, Chile, Bolivia and India. For these projects, the LGS has founded an independent Non- governmental organization, the Guiden a Scouten mat der Dr√´tter Welt (Guides and Scouts for the Third World).

History With the independence of Tanganyika in December 1961, the two battalions of the King's African Rifles which had been raised in the colony were transferred to the newly independent nation. These were the 6th (Tanganyika Territory) Battalion (becoming the 1st Tanganyika Rifles) and the 26th (Tanganyika Territory) Battalion (becoming the 2nd Tanganyika Rifles). Mutiny Despite having become part of the Tanganyikan military, the bulk of the officers of the regiment were still British, as had been the case in the King's African Rifles. In January 1964, following unrest in Zanzibar, the regiment mutinied. The 1st Battalion seized key points in Dar es Salaam on the 19th, deposing their officers and sending them to neighbouring Kenya; on the 20th, the 2nd Battalion, in Tabora, joined the mutiny. The entire country's military had now rebelled, with the British High Commissioner briefly detained and most of the strategic points in the capital held by the mutineers. After appeals from the President, Julius Nyerere, the United Kingdom dispatched an aircraft carrier, HMS Centaur from Aden, with a force from the garrison there, to stand off Dar es Salaam. On the British government receiving the request in writing from Nyerere, a company of Royal Marines from No. 45 Commando were landed by helicopter in Dar es Salaam on the 25th, assaulting and quickly capturing the barracks holding the 1st Battalion; many of the mutineers quickly surrendered after a guardroom was destroyed by an anti-tank missile. After landings later that day, including a small number of armoured cars of the 16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers, most of the remaining mutineers had likewise surrendered; the 2nd Battalion had not been engaged, but had offered to surrender after hearing of the events in Dar es Salaam; a party of Marines travelled there and secured the barracks the next day. Within twenty-four hours of the initial landings, and a week of the mutiny, the men of the 1st battalion were dismissed and the regiment effectively ceased to exist. The regiment was never reformed; after the union of Tanganyika with Zanzibar later that year, the previously existing army was formally disbanded, and the Tanzania People's Defence Force was formed in September 1964, firmly under local civilian control. Many of the African officers of the 1st Battalion, and the officers and men of the 2nd, were incorporated into the new force.

Life Born in Vienna, he was the fifth child and first son of Anselm von Rothschild (1803‚Äì1874) and his wife Charlotte von Rothschild (1807‚Äì1859). His grandfather Salomon Mayer von Rothschild (1774‚Äì1855), a native from Frankfurt, had founded the Viennese S M von Rothschild banking house in 1820, continued as the Creditanstalt by his father. Nathaniel as the eldest male was expected to take over the running of the family's Austrian banking business. He studied at Br√ºnn but fell out of favor with his father who considered him extravagant and financially irresponsible. Rather than going into business, Nathaniel spent his life as a socialite who built mansions and collected works of art. Palais Nathaniel Rothschild, gardens From 1872 to 1884, he had the Palais Nathaniel Rothschild erected at 14-16 Theresianumgasse in Vienna-Wieden in a lavish Ringstra√üe style inspired by French Renaissance architecture. He himself lived alone in a small apartment, while in various parts of the building his large collection of art was on display. The palais was badly damaged by the bombing of Vienna in World War II and afterwards demolished. In 1880, he purchased Enzesfeld Castle with its vast property from the Counts of Sch√∂nburg-Hartenstein. He also had Hinterleiten Palace in Reichenau an der Rax erected in a Louis XIII style from 1884. The picturesque Reichenau area had become easily accessible from Vienna by the opening of the Southern Railway line and evolved into a popular retreat of the Viennese society, among them Habsburg Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria who had Villa Wartholz built nearby. Nevertheless, Nathaniel Rothschild only spent two years at his palace before he placed it at the disposal of the Ministry of War to use it as a convalescent home for veterans. On his father's death in 1874, Nathaniel and his brother Ferdinand (1839‚Äì1898), owner of Waddesdon Manor, inherited most of the family's real estate and art collection. The family business went to the youngest brother Albert (1844‚Äì1911), who successfully carried on the financial empire. Nathaniel Rothschild became known for his substantial philanthropic and charitable activities and was highly popular with members of Vienna's aristocratic society, something that aided the family image and therefore its business. Beyond Vienna, he was as a benefactor to the Enzesfeld community, where in 1900 he donated the elementary school and funded other municipal works. Nathaniel Anselm von Rothschild died a bachelor in 1905. He is buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna.

No tenor saxophone was present in this recording section, nor in \\"Crescendo in Blue,\\" which was recorded the same day. In its early form, the two individual pieces, \\"Diminuendo in Blue\\" and \\"Crescendo in Blue,\\" were recorded on opposite sides of a 78 rpm record. The 1956 performance at the Newport Jazz Festival revitalized Ellington's career, making newspaper headlines when seated audience members chaotically began rising to dance and stand on their chairs during Paul Gonsalves's tenor saxophone solo. Performances before 1956 In early performances, \\"Crescendo\\" was played before \\"Diminuendo.\\" It was played at the 1938 Randall's Island concert with Ellington playing the interlude on piano. During the mid-1940s, Ellington tried all sorts of pieces between these tunes, particularly in a series of broadcasts he made for the Treasury Department in 1945 and 1946. There are issued recordings of him playing \\"I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)\\", \\"Carnegie Blues\\", \\"Rocks in My Bed\\" and \\"Transblucency\\" between these two pieces. The last piece was specifically composed as a wordless vocal for Kay Davis. Later that decade, Duke once again tried a piano solo between them. 1956 Newport Jazz Festival In what has since become jazz folklore, Gonsalves almost created a riot as he played a tenor sax solo for 27 choruses that aroused the normally seated crowd into a frenzy of dancing, standing on chairs, and rushing the stage. A woman with platinum blond hair in a black evening dress, named Elaine Anderson, jumped from her box seat to start dancing, and she is often credited with initiating the crowd's ensuing uproar as Gonsalves continued his solo. In later performances, Gonsalves played as many as 60 choruses. This song, along with the other performances at the festival by Ellington's band, were released as a live recording which helped revive Ellington's flagging career. Personnel of Newport July 1956 concert were: Clark Terry, Ray Nance, Willie Cook, Cat Anderson (trumpet), Britt Woodman, Quentin Jackson (trombone), Jimmy Hamilton, Paul Gonsalves (tenor saxophone), Johnny Hodges, Russel Procope (alto saxophone), Harry Carney (baritone saxophone), Jimmy Woode, Sam Woodyard (drums), and Duke Ellington (piano). \\"The Newport Jazz Festival Suite\\" and \\"Jeep's Blues\\" were rerecorded on July 9, 1956, in Columbia's New York studio. However, on every issue of Ellington at Newport, \\"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue\\" is from the Newport stage, with varying sound quality. 1958 Alhambra Concert On October 29th, 1958 Ellington gave a concert at the Alhambra Theatre in Paris, (Duke Ellington \\"At the Alhambra \\" Columbia Rec. 1959). This is a faster version of the classical 1937 recording. Personnel of this recording session were the same as 1956 Newport Concert, plus Booty Wood on trombone. 1966 recording There is a later recording of \\"Diminuendo In Blue/Blow by Blow\\" on the album Ella and Duke at the Cote D'Azur, recorded live in Juan-les-Pins on the French Riviera between June 26 and July 29, 1966, for Verve Records. Paul Gonsalves is featured on the \\"Blow by Blow\\" section. References *\\"Turn Up That Noise\\", review of Ellington at Newport 1956 (Complete) by Gene Hyde, June 7, 1999.

The seventh mainline installment in the Ridge Racer series, it was developed as a launch title for the console. The game has around 40 cars, many of which return from Ridge Racer 6 and the PSP incarnations of the game. There are also 22 courses, available in forward, reverse and mirror mode. The game runs at 1080p native resolution and 60 frames per second. It also features Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and free online gameplay via the PlayStation Network. The game was first unveiled at the 2006 E3 event in a teaser trailer, and the first trailer of game footage was shown at the 2006 Tokyo Game Show. Like many other games in the series, it features a full motion video opening that stars Reiko Nagase. The game received positive reviews from critics, and has since been re-issued under Sony's \\"Platinum\\" and \\"The Best\\" budget lines. A patch was made available in October 2010 titled \\"Ridge Racer 7 3D License Version\\" that enables Ridge Racer 7 to be played in 3D. Gameplay As in previous games within the Ridge Racer series, the gameplay centers on high speed circuit racing featuring \\"drift\\" handling, where the player slides the car around turns without great loss of speed. New features in this iteration include car body and engine customization which can affect the performance, handling and nitrous boost system of the car. Ridge Racer 7 also actively encourages players to slipstream other cars, whereas previous iterations did not mention that this technique increases speed. A global ranking system is used to rank players. It uses a combination of FP (Fame points), CR (Credits, the game's currency) and OBP (Online Battle Points, gained in the online races) to work out an overall number of RP (Ridge Points), which are displayed on the player's Ridge State ID Card. =Game modes= Single player * Ridge State Grand Prix - The main game mode consisting of a series of races. * Manufacturer's Trials - special races where the player can earn new cars or parts to customize their car, if you get 100 Manufacturer points you will be a member of one manufacturer. * UFRA Single Event - special races with restrictions. * Extreme Battle - boss battles with a much higher difficulty and you can win normal cars, or special cars. * Arcade - a single player game mode where the player can choose among the unlocked tracks or cars. Multiplayer * Global Time Attack - a time trial mode where players race their cars around the circuits as fast as possible and post their best lap times on a global leaderboard. * Standard Race - a standard race over the Internet for up to 14 players. * Pair Time Attack - Similar to Global Time Attack, but instead combines the times of two racers working in tandem to achieve fast lap times. * Team Battle - players are split into red and blue teams (other colors are featured, such as yellow, green and pink), with a points system used to decide which team wins after a race. * Pair Battle - players are split into teams of two to race, and the winning team is that with the smallest total race time. * UFRA Special Event - A set of 25 extra events, downloaded for free from the PlayStation Store, which boast a much higher difficulty than any event in the Ridge State Grand Prix mode. The choice of cars is often preset or massively narrowed down. Extras On 22 March 2007, Namco released downloadable extras and content for Ridge Racer 7 through the PlayStation Network. This content includes extra events (the UFRA Special Events) and special decals for customizing the roof of the car. Players also have the option to purchase extra background music for their game. These add-ons were added to the US PlayStation Store on 1 June 2007. A patch for the game was released in October 2010 to make the game playable in 3D. The classic arcade game Xevious is unlockable in this game. Reception =Critic reviews= The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four nines for a total of 36 out of 40. =Awards= Ridge Racer 7 received the IGN Award for Best PlayStation 3 Racing Game of 2006.

The character appeared in their futuristic comic book line dubbed Marvel 2099 in X-Men 2099. His creators were John Francis Moore and Ron Lim. Fictional character biography Eddie's past before the X-Men is never revealed, aside from mentioning that he was a syntho-percussionist for a band named the Armageddon Choir. He is a devout believer in Xi'an's dream of mutant equality and the X-Men. After Xi'an is shot, he helps break into the Synge casino to find evidence to clear Xi'an of murdering the owner, Noah Synge. It is revealed that Synge's son Lytton murdered him, so the X-Men are freed and take to the road.X-Men 2099 #1-3 They next search for a woman named Mama Hurricane, for information on the mutant underground railroad during the Great Purge. When they arrive they are attacked by a group of Degens (genetically enhanced humans) calling themselves the Freakshow. Eddie bumps into Contagion, a Freakshow member whose touch infects the victim with a virus of unknown origin and effect. Eddie's body begins to morph and his metallo-mimetic abilities begin manifesting at random. Xi'an is able to heal the virus with his mutant ability but the damage to his body is irreparable. He is left in a bulky humanoid state, unable to return to plain flesh and trapped in an alloyed state, unable to use his powers to alter his metallic composition.X-Men 2099 #6-7 Mama Hurricane gives them information on where to search next, however Eddie decides to remain with the freakshow, suffering from depression at his new monstrous appearance. He travels with them to the lands of the Keewazi tribe, developing a relationship with Freakshow member Rosa Vasquez. Glitterspike, an assassin and the father of Rosa's unborn baby, attacks the group, intent on stealing his child and selling it to the black market once born. Eddie and the others succeed in trapping Glitterspike in a cave with an alien monster, the Shadow dancer, and is presumed dead. During this battle, Eddie's power to absorb properties of any metal he touches returns, though he still cannot return to flesh.X-Men 2099 #16-17 Months later, Glitterspike returns, having escaped the Shadow dancer, losing an arm in the process. As he attacks Eddie, Rosa goes into labor. Eddie is defeated, but Rosa's unborn baby, who Cerebra stated would be a mutant, incapacitates Glitterspike and they are able to escape. Rosa gives birth to a son, Joaquim Vasquez, and asks Eddie to be his Godfather.X-Men 2099 #23-25 They appear later, being saved by Bloodhawk from bandits while traveling through the desert toward the mutant city-state of Halo City. Eddie meets up with his X-Men brethren for the first time since leaving them to join the Freakshow. Their joy is short-lived as Joaquim is kidnapped by Vulcann, a bloodsmith who can freely alter the bodies of his victims. He accelerates Joaquim's aging, making him appear as a late-teen, early twenties man and fully realizing his mutant abilities. They return to Halo City as the city begins flooding, a product of the melting polar ice caps. Vulcann plans to use Joaquim to lead the mutant generation and bend them to his will. Eddie attempts to stop him but is sent flying across the city by Joaquim. As he returns he is captured with the rest of the X-Men. A distraction by a crashing Atlantean ship gives Eddie and Bloodhawk the opportunity and they chain Vulcann to a rock beneath the ocean leaving him to die. Eddie leaves, with the others, to get to higher ground, namely the Savage Land.X-Men 2099 #30-35 In the Savage Land, Eddie helps to build a new civilization for humankind, though he has been separated somehow from Rosa and Joaquim. During the final phase of the Phalanx invasion he is completely infected with the techno-organic virus, but as the collective is destroyed his body still retains the virus. He is able to use his ferromorphic abilities to purge it from himself, as Rosa arrives. Shakti, now without her mutant powers and paralyzed, works with Franklin, a semi-sentient robot created by Reed Richards, to study Joaquim and find a way to return him to his proper age.2099: World of Tomorrow #1-8 Eddie recently returned in X-Men Blue, along with the other teammates of X-Men 2099, meeting the original time displaced X-Men. He also appeared as part of the Freakshow, in Multiple Man mini-series. Powers Originally, Metalhead had the ability to transform from a human form to a metal form with increased strength, durability, resistance to injury, and whatever specific properties that metal had (e.g. adamantium would give him invulnerability, copper would give him increased electrical conductivity, gold would be softer, etc.) dependent upon a type of metal which he made contact with. However, after his battle with Contagion he was stuck in his hulking metallic form and incapable of reverting to human form. He was still capable of shifting the molecular composition of his skin though. In other media *Metalhead was made into an action figure as part of Toy Biz's X-Men 2099 line.

It was known as Otis Air Force Base prior to its transfer from the active duty Air Force to the Air National Guard. In the local community, it is more commonly known as Otis Air Base or simply Otis. It was named in honor of pilot and Boston surgeon Lt. Frank \\"Jesse\\" Otis. Today major units include the Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Coast Guard Base Cape Cod and the 102nd Intelligence Wing. Other units include the wing's 101st Air Operations Squadron, the 253d Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group, the 212th Engineering Installation Squadron, the 267th Combat Communications Squadron, the 202nd Weather Flight, the 3rd Battalion, 126th Aviation Regiment, part of the 29th Infantry Division (Army National Guard), and the Coastal Patrol Squadron 18, Cape Cod Composite Squadron 044-Massachusetts Wing (Civil Air Patrol). SSgt Nasam Rissvi guards an F-15 at Otis ANGB during a December sunset Establishment Photo of Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Otis, circa 1943 Otis Air National Guard Base is named for pilot, flight surgeon, and eminent Boston City Hospital surgeon Lt. Frank \\"Jesse\\" Otis.According to the 102d Intelligence Wing Public Affairs office, http://www.aviationarchaeology.com/src/1940sB4/1937.htm He was a member of the 101st Observation Squadron who was killed on 11 January 1937 when his Douglas O-46A crashed at Hennepin, Illinois while on a cross-country training mission. In 1938, the landing field area at Camp Edwards was named Otis Field in his memory. Ten years later, the base was renamed Otis Air Force Base in his honor. During the Korean War, it was used by the Army to provide basic training. Until 1973, it was the largest Aerospace Defense Command base in the world. During World War II, the field was known as Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Otis and was a subordinate field for Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island. Cold War F-51H Mustang from the 104th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the Maryland Air National Guard at Otis in 1954 EC-121 Warning Star support crew on the tarmac During the Cold War, the base was a key Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) installation. Activities included the 33rd Fighter Wing, the 4604th Support Squadron supporting the Texas Towers (1956‚Äì63), the 60th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, and the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing aircraft, flying over the Atlantic Ocean from 1954. The 551st flew the EC-121 Warning Star before moving to Hanscom Air Force Base in 1969. The 551st was also the first Air Force wing to fly the EC-121. The 33rd flew various fighter jets in conjunction with the 60th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. The expanding mission led to the runways being lengthened in 1960. The base was also home to the 26th Air Defense Missile Squadron, which operated BOMARC surface-to-air missiles. The regular air force began leaving Otis in the late 1960s as improvements in radar made the 551st more costly when compared to newer technologies. The 551st and the 60th left Otis when the Air Force began to move the continental air defense mission over to the Air National Guard. Strategic Air Command maintained the 19th Air Refueling Squadron at Otis AFB flying the KC-97 Stratofreighter. After the squadron inactivated, SAC assigned Detachment 1, 416th Bombardment Wing/ 41st Air Refueling Squadron, based at Griffiss AFB, New York with 2 KC-135 Stratotanker and 2 99th Bombardment Wing / 99th Air Refueling Squadron, Westover AFB, Massachusetts KC-135 Stratotankers on 24 Hour Alert Duty. After active duty units left, the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 102d Fighter Wing (102 FW) became the main unit at the base, flying fighter and air defense missions. During the Cold War period from 1964 until 2004, the 102 FW operated a variety of air defense and tactical fighter aircraft, including the F-86H Sabre, F-84B/F Thunderstreak, F-100D Super Sabre, F-106A/B Delta Dart and F-15A/B Eagle. The Wing's 101st Tactical Fighter Squadron shared missions with the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing during the Cold War. In 1987, the 102 FW transitioned to the F-15A Eagle, and, later, to the F-15C Eagle. The base was also utilized as a stopover for a French Air Force Mirage IV on the way to French Polynesia for Operation Tamoure. Following the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, the 102 FW was directed to transfer its F-15 aircraft to its sister unit, the 104th Fighter Wing at Barnes Municipal Airport/ANGB. All F-15 aircraft were transferred by January 2008 and the 102 FW was redesignated as the 102d Intelligence Wing (102 IW), a non-flying unit. President John F. Kennedy used Otis on many occasions for the landing of Air Force One when he traveled to the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis. He would then board an Army or Marine Corps helicopter which would then take him to the compound. It was at the Otis AFB Hospital that his wife, Jacqueline, gave birth to their son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, who died two days later. =Closure= In the early 1970s, Otis AFB was marked for closure as part of a nationwide reduction of military bases, to cut costs as the Vietnam War wound down. In 1973, Governor of Massachusetts Francis W. Sargent appointed the Otis Task Force to oversee a phase-down of military activities at the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR). The major concern of Cape residents was the fate of base property and impacts on the local economy as military activities decreased. While the future of the base was in limbo, ideas were floated that would include the redeveloping of the base into a recreation center of sorts that would rival Disneyland. The state even went so far as to mail out brochures to 1,500 corporations around the world, advertising the redevelopment opportunities of the base. =PAVE PAWS= F-106 Delta Dart taking off on a rainy day In 1977, Otis AFB was officially redistributed with the establishment of boundary lines which divided the complex into several installations, all within the confines of the original Otis AFB. Established was Otis Air National Guard Base, Camp Edwards (an Army National Guard small arms training facility that served as a POW camp during World War II), and Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod (which utilizes the Otis ANGB runways). Together they form the Massachusetts Military Reservation, where 17 other state, federal and private entities operate within its boundaries. In 1978, the Regular Air Force returned to Otis ANGB with the construction of the Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System (PAVE PAWS) near the Cape Cod Canal. PAVE PAWS is designed to detect airborne ballistic missiles and monitor orbiting satellites. Twenty-first century F-15s formerly from the 102nd return to Otis on 11 July 2013. The 104th Fighter Wing will maintain its alert posture within the existing alert-infrastructure on Cape Cod while the training missions will fly out of Westover Air Reserve Base. Otis ANGB was originally scheduled to be closed by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), but it was spared in last minute decisions. However, the 102nd Fighter Wing did lose its F-15 Eagle and transitioned to a non-flying mission, redesignated as the 102d Intelligence Wing. The only military aircraft currently based at Otis ANGB are those of the Coast Guard, although transient military aircraft continue to use the facility, and the Navy has considered it as a place of interest should they decide to base naval forces in the Northeast again.http://www.defenselink.mil/brac/pdf/VolIV_Navy-o.pdfhttp://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120413/NEWS/204130337 A partnership was created on December 22, 2006 among the Coast Guard, National Guard, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Coast Guard assumed control of the aviation facilities from the Air Force, the Air National Guard took over the management of the utilities, and the state funds the emergency services and fire protection. Improvements to the lighting system were put in control of the Coast Guard.http://www.uscg.mil/COMDT/DOCS/USCG%20FY09%20Congressional%20Budget%20Submission%201-25-08.pdf The Federal Aviation Administration has released new flight procedures that identify the ICAO code KFMH with the name of Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod.http://www.airnav.com/airport/KFMH On November 6, 2009, ground was broken on new facilities for the 102nd Intelligence Wing. The airport was a NASA Space Shuttle launch abort site. In May 2013, it was announced that one third of the 104th Fighter Wing's F-15 aircraft would be moving to Otis to take up an alert mission for four to six months, as Barnes Municipal Airport's runway underwent renovation. In December 2013, Otis was selected as a test site by the United States Federal Aviation Administration to \\"aid in researching the complexities of integrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems into the congested, northeast airspace.\\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology will work with Otis to test drones at the airport. =September 11, 2001= On September 11, 2001, the North American Aerospace Defense Command alerted the base at 8:41 to be put on battle stations. Four minutes later, Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash were scrambled and flew F-15 Eagle fighters out of the base heading toward New York City to intercept the plane. They departed somewhere between 8:46 and 8:52. Both pilots were interviewed in the 2006 documentary Flight 175: As the World Watched. Environmental issues Military operations in the early years at Otis AFB included the use of petroleum products and other hazardous materials, such as fuels, motor oils, and cleaning solvents, and the generation of associated wastes. It was common practice for many years to dispose of such wastes in landfills, dry wells, sumps, and the sewage treatment plant. Spills and leaks also occurred. These activities had a serious impact on the Upper Cape's groundwater resources; much of the water supply in the surrounding area was converted from wells to municipal water sources as a direct result of the threats from waste plumes in the groundwater. Residents of nearby towns raised concerns about possible adverse effects on health of humans resulting from PAVE PAWS radiation. Remediation on the site occurred in 1998 and a 2005 report from the National Academies Press found no evidence of adverse health effects from PAVE PAWS.Economic & Fiscal Impact Evaluation In 2012, a wind turbine started operating in the area which is powering 25-30% of the energy used in the remediation effort.Wind-Powered Remediation at the Massachusetts Military Reservation on Cape Cod, MA Accidents and incidents A crew photo of the EC-121H Warning Star (s/n 55-5262, ex-USN BuNo 141289) at Otis Air Force Base.

It is named after the eponymous Ridge Racer video game series to which it belongs. The game was released in Japan on 12 December 2004, in North America on 24 March 2005, and in Europe and Australia on 1 September 2005 as a launch title. Available in the game is a fully playable version of the Namco arcade game New Rally-X. Ridge Racer has been described as a 'compilation' of the series, featuring tracks, cars and remixed soundtrack from previous titles in the 1990s. Ridge Racer was very well received by critics and was praised for its visuals, gameplay and soundtrack. It was re-released in 2005/2006 as a platinum title. A sequel titled Ridge Racer 2 has also been released for the PSP. Gameplay The core aspect of the entire Ridge Racer series is drift racing, that is traditional lap racing against opponents with the added twist of intentionally oversteering and sliding the car through sharp corners and turns, known as \\"drifting\\", which earns the player several bonuses during a race. Game modes are World Tour, Single race, Time Trial, and Wireless Battle, which supports up to 8 player multiplayer over the PSP's ad hoc, Wi-Fi network capability (see PSP Wireless Networking for further information). The game also features a full motion video opening, that shows series mascot Reiko Nagase. =Nitrous= Notable in the game is the \\"nitrous boost\\" system. The player has a Nitrous Gauge made up of three nitrous tanks, which at the start of a race are either completely depleted or only partially full. As the player drifts through the corners (especially at very high Slip angles) during the race, their nitrous gauge fills up. When the player fills up one of the three nitrous tanks, it can be activated to achieve a temporary speed boost. The nitrous tanks cannot be recharged while any tank is in use though, but the residual speed increase when the nitrous boost expires can be used just before entering corners to recharge the player's nitrous tanks at a faster rate than normal.

Reception Ridge Racer received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Its graphical ability and visuals were incredible on a portable device in 2004, and it was further praised for its gameplay, soundtrack (which also consisted of remixed tracks from older Ridge Racer titles) and multiplayer option. PALGN said the game \\"shows the system off beautifully, the graphics and the gameplay combining to make this the greatest Ridge Racer title yet.\\" GameBiz said, \\"Anyone doubting the power of the handheld will be left eating their words after sampling just one lap of this unbelievably accomplished first effort from Namco.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights and two nines for a total of 34 out of 40.

Born in Frankfurt, she was the eighth and youngest child of Anselm von Rothschild (1803‚Äì1874) and Charlotte Rothschild (1807‚Äì1859) and younger sister to the British politician, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild. She was a small child when her family moved to Vienna, where her father took over management of the family-owned S M von Rothschild bank. Family life Alice von Rothschild's mother was the daughter of Nathan Mayer Rothschild of London and as a result the family would have close connections to the English branch of the Rothschild family. Her brother Ferdinand, with whom she was very close, studied at Cambridge University and married an English cousin. The Grey Drawing Room at Waddesdon Manor, which Miss Alice inherited after her brother's death. Her mother died when she was twelve and as a result of her busy father who travelled constantly, she spent a lonely childhood, living with various relations. Photographs of Alice as a girl and a young woman show her \\"with a broad brow, firm full lips and a strong chin, not conventionally pretty, but full of character\\". This sense of character is what makes Miss Alice so renowned for her 'formidable' reputation. Girouard states that it is down to two events that helped convert the young, girlish Miss Alice to her strong older self, that being first acting as hostess for her brother Ferdinand, at Leighton House and then at Waddesdon Manor - and secondly being after the death of her father in 1874, leaving her a wealthy woman. Much to the family's surprise, she was left the original Rothschild family home in Frankfurt alongside a house and estate at the Grunburg, just outside. When her brother Ferdinand began the construction in 1874 of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire England, Alice acquired a nearby property at Eythrope for herself. There, between 1876 and 1879, she had a park and garden created and a house built near the river called Eythrope Pavilion. Although, as Alice had suffered from rheumatic fever, she had been advised not to sleep near water as dampness would aggravate her health problem meaning her house was built for solely for daytime occupation. Therefore, at nights she returned to stay at Waddesdon Manor.  Inheritance  In late 1898, following the death of her brother, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, Alice inherited Waddesdon Manor and his London House. During World War I she had the formal gardens at Waddesdon and Eythrope given over to the growing of vegetables for the less fortunate. The Eythrope Pavilion was still maintained but now as even more of an occasional retreat. As her health declined she spent more of her time at her magnificent ch√¢teau, \\"Villa Victoria\\", in the balmier climate of the town of Grasse in the Alpes-Maritimes d√©partement in France. Her property was located about 12 miles (19 Kilometers) inland, north of the Mediterranean coast and here she created an enormous garden that employed more than one hundred gardeners. A spinster, she wanted to be near family, and her ch√¢teau was close to Cannes, where her cousin Laura Th√©r√®se von Rothschild, widow of James-Edouard de Rothschild owned the Villa Rothschild, Cannes, and only 34 miles (55 kilometers) from Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild, the seaside estate owned by another cousin, B√©atrice Ephrussi de Rothschild. Queen Victoria vacationed in Grasse and visited Villa Victoria. According to the book The Rothschild Gardens by Miriam Rothschild, at the turn of the century, Alice Rothschild spent the equivalent of nearly half-a-million pounds (Sterling) annually on her gardens and grounds at Grasse. Imperious in nature, Alice was a strong-willed person who spoke her mind. According to a 2001 book by author Michael Nelson: \\"the Queen stepped on a lawn and across a flower-bed [at Waddesdon Manor], inadvertently crushing several plants. The baroness could not contain herself and roughly told the sovereign in effect to 'Get out'. Thereafter the Queen always referred to her as 'The All-Powerful One'.\\"  Collecting and innovating conservation  brother died and bequested the majority of his renaissance collection to the British Museum. She therefore added major pieces of armour to the armoury corridor, just outside the Smoking Room. Like most other members of the Rothschild family, Alice Rothschild was a collector of art. While she acquired paintings, sculptures and objets d'art, Alice von Rothschild also had a unique collection of smoking pipes, including French, Spanish and Italian examples from the 17th century. The collection was donated to the town of Grasse, France on her death in 1922, where her winter property was based. The ch√¢teau in Grasse later became the hotel \\"Parc Palace\\", where the famous French actor G√©rard Philipe was raised. Alice von Rothschild willed Waddesdon Manor to James Armand de Rothschild. Avenue Rothschild in Grasse is named in her honor. Along these same lines, Miss Alice was also an avid and careful collector for Waddesdon Manor, and added elements to Ferdinand's previous collection in order to fill the gap left when he bequested much of his renaissance artworks to the British Museum (now referred to as the Waddesdon Bequest). For instance, the helmet of the emperor Charles V is a prominent contribution of Miss Alice's to the Armoury Corridor, upstairs in the Bachelor's Wing. She regarded herself as 'the protector' of Ferdinand's inheritance and is famous for establishing ‚ÄòMiss Alice‚Äôs Rules' ‚Äì guidelines for the care and preservation of the collections which even today form the foundation for those conservation rules of the National Trust.

Biography Guitarist Mark Brandon, bassist Owain North and vocalist Paul Usher met at an early age and played together in various lineups, however became serious about a career as a band following the recruitment of drummer Andrew Grant. Following a series of local gigs, the band caught the ear of Alan McGee in early 2004 who would subsequently sign the band to his Poptones label later that year. The band gained momentum, supporting bands such as The Others and The Boxer Rebellion and doing their own headline tour surrounding the release of their first single, \\"Plus\\". The single received airplay from renowned DJs such as Steve Lamacq and Tom Robinson, who made it single of the week on his BBC Radio 6 Music evening show. The single also received airplay from XFM where the band did a live session. The debut single Plus was released on 8 November to positive reviews, and charted at Number 57 in the UK Singles Chart. Cited as the 'kid brothers' of Radiohead, Echelon moved into 2005 touring consistently and recording the follow-up to \\"Plus\\" and filming the corresponding video. After an appearance at Glastonbury the delayed follow up single \\"Windows Shut\\" / \\"This Room\\" (a double A-Side) was released on 17 October.

(TTARS) is the national amateur radio organization in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is a member society of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU).IARU Member Societies  History  The first amateur radio contact from Trinidad and Tobago was made in 1929 by an airline co-pilot by the name of Colin Fraser with another radio operator, S. R. Connelly, W3BCR from Pennsylvania, United States. Colin later adopted the callsign VP4CF. This contact was made using morse code on the 40 meter amateur band. A few other operators soon joined him, building radios from plans and kits. Since amateur radio in Trinidad was not regulated or licensed, most amateurs used arbitrary callsigns. One of the early pioneers in Trinidad, Paul Alonzo, VP4TK, used amateur radio to broadcast cricket results on the 40 meter band. His equipment was later seized by the local police and he was charged with operating radio equipment without a license. Public outcry from citizens made it evident that licensing and regulation was needed. After World War II there were many changes made to amateur radio. Government regulation and licensing were put into effect. Since a formal procedure was now established, many people joined the hobby. In response to this, several local hams founded the first radio club in Trinidad in 1951 as a means of self-regulation and coordination of amateur radio activities. It was called the Amateur Radio Society of Trinidad and Tobago (ARSTT). It functioned until 1959 when it became dormant. Another local club, the South Trinidad Amateur Radio Society (STARS) was formed at that time. In 1961, ARSTT was reactivated under the name of TTARS, the Trinidad and Tobago Amateur Radio Society, a name which it retains to this day. TTARS was eventually incorporated by Act of Parliament: Act 13/1981.Laws of Trinidad and Tobago, List of Omitted Acts p. 24 In 2001, The REACT International Convention was held in Trinidad and Tobago, with the support of TTARS.ARRL Newsletter e  Membership  TTARS offers four membership levels: full, associate, honorary and affiliate. To be eligible for full membership, one requires an amateur radio license issued by the Trinidad and Tobago government. Dues from full members go mainly toward maintaining the repeaters and the club station, as well as the general operational costs of the society. Only full financial members get the ability to vote and run for office as elected TTARS officials.  Services  TTARS publishes a call book listing radio amateurs in Trinidad and Tobago. Information in the directory includes call sign, name, addresses, and telephone numbers. It is usually distributed at the Annual General Meeting and is updated periodically. Members are also entitled to use the TTARS QSL Bureau for sending and receiving QSL cards.  Regions  In an effort to encourage full participation of members in all parts of the country, TTARS has four regions which coincide with regions administered by Trinidad and Tobago local government and the respective regional corporations. The Northern region consists of the North West part of the island of Trinidad, which comprises Diego Martin, San Juan‚ÄìLaventille and the City of Port of Spain. The Central region consists of the central and north east part of the island of Trinidad, which comprises the regions of Tunapuna‚ÄìPiarco, Sangre Grande, Couva‚ÄìTabaquite‚ÄìTalparo as well as the boroughs of Chaguanas and Arima. The Southern region consists of the southern part of the island of Trinidad, which comprises the regions of Princes Town, Siparia, Rio Claro-Mayaro, Penal‚ÄìDebe, as well as the Borough of Point Fortin and the city of San Fernando. The Tobago Region consists of the entire Island of Tobago, which includes the city of Scarborough.  Headquarters and club station  TTARS headquarters is currently located at Boy Scouts' Headquarters in Port of Spain, Trinidad. It houses a well equipped station covering all HF amateur radio bands on most modes and a packet radio digipeater. The club station is managed by a club custodian and open to guests to operate during some weekday evenings. A second TTARS sponsored station with the callsign 9Y4PCS in San Fernando operates out of Presentation College and was managed by Anthony Lee-Mack, 9Y4AL, who was a teacher at the school until his death. TTARS is now working with the school to continue the operations of 9Y4PCS in 9Y4AL's absence.  Current activities  TTARS coordinates several activities related to Amateur Radio in Trinidad and Tobago on most popular amateur radio bands, including HF bands and the two meter band. TTARS holds an annual emergency exercise or Field Day which may or may not coincide with the IARU region 2 field day. Local radio amateurs operate from a sponsored campsite, usually, a beach house in a remote region in the North East of Trinidad called Toco and talk to other hams worldwide. TTARS operates three FM repeaters on the two meter VHF amateur band. Trinidad is covered by two repeaters. One of them is located on the Northern mountain range and its operating frequency is 147.93 MHz with a negative shift of 600 kHz and covers most of the island. However, coverage is best in the Northern part of the island. Sometimes, hams from other Caribbean Islands such as Grenada and St. Vincent are able to talk to hams in Trinidad via this repeater. This repeater is the most heavily used by local hams. The second repeater in Trinidad is located in the Central Range and operates on 146.94 MHz with a negative shift of 600 kHz. It covers most of the island but its coverage is best in Central and South Trinidad. There is a third repeater in Tobago on 147.76 MHz, also with a negative shift of 600kHz. This repeater covers Tobago and North East Trinidad. TTARS runs two club nets. The first net is the Sunday night 2 meter net held on the 147.93 MHz repeater on Sunday nights at 7:59PM local time or 2359 UTC. If the main repeater is not available, 146.94 is used as an alternate. The second net is the Hummingbird net and is held on 7.159 MHz LSB in the 40 meter band on Sunday mornings at 9AM local time or 1300 UTC. These repeaters are available for use in emergencies as listed by the U.S. Navy.Hurricane Plans and Preparation, Curacao, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. The local Boy Scouts movement, in conjunction with TTARS participates in the worldwide annual Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) where scouts are given the opportunity to talk to Scouts in other parts of the world via amateur radio. Classes are held for those wishing to take the examination in order to obtain an amateur radio license. The locations vary from time to time, but there is usually one in Presentation College, San Fernando run by Anthony Lee-Mack, 9Y4AL. Occasionally, TTARS sponsors amateur radio contests. The most notable of these is the Worked All Trinidad and Tobago Simplex or WATTS contest. The objective of this contest is to make contact with as many amateur radio operators in Trinidad and Tobago without the aid of repeater stations or satellites. The club station 9Y4TT is also active for some contests including the IARU HF championships. TTARS operates the QSL Bureau for Trinidad and Tobago.  Emergency Preparedness  The Emergency Communications Service (EmComms) is an organization within TTARS that provides amateur radio communications during times of emergency and disaster, most notably hurricanes and floods. It is headed by an Emergency Coordinator who coordinates emergency and disaster preparedness plans and assigns amateur radio resources in the event of an activation by an affiliated agency. EmComms works closely with O.D.P.M as well as the local regional corporations that comprise local Government. There is some cooperation with the local CB clubs as well as the local chapter of REACT International, but this is mostly done through EmComms. TTARS membership is not a requirement to participate in emergency preparedness involving amateur radio in Trinidad and Tobago.

The number p must be prime, and the elementary abelian groups are a particular kind of p-group. The case where p = 2, i.e., an elementary abelian 2-group, is sometimes called a Boolean group. Every elementary abelian p-group is a vector space over the prime field with p elements, and conversely every such vector space is an elementary abelian group. By the classification of finitely generated abelian groups, or by the fact that every vector space has a basis, every finite elementary abelian group must be of the form (Z/pZ)n for n a non-negative integer (sometimes called the group's rank). Here, Z/pZ denotes the cyclic group of order p (or equivalently the integers mod p), and the superscript notation means the n-fold direct product of groups. In general, a (possibly infinite) elementary abelian p-group is a direct sum of cyclic groups of order p. (Note that in the finite case the direct product and direct sum coincide, but this is not so in the infinite case.) Presently, in the rest of this article, these groups are assumed finite.  Examples and properties  * The elementary abelian group (Z/2Z)2 has four elements: . Addition is performed componentwise, taking the result modulo 2\\\\. For instance, . This is in fact the Klein four-group. * In the group generated by the symmetric difference on a (not necessarily finite) set, every element has order 2. Any such group is necessarily abelian because, since every element is its own inverse, xy = (xy)‚àí1 = y‚àí1x‚àí1 = yx. Such a group (also called a Boolean group), generalizes the Klein four-group example to an arbitrary number of components. * (Z/pZ)n is generated by n elements, and n is the least possible number of generators. In particular, the set , where ei has a 1 in the ith component and 0 elsewhere, is a minimal generating set. * Every elementary abelian group has a fairly simple finite presentation. :: (\\\\mathbb Z/p\\\\mathbb Z)^n \\\\cong \\\\langle e_1,\\\\ldots,e_n\\\\mid e_i^p = 1,\\\\ e_i e_j = e_j e_i \\\\rangle  Vector space structure  Suppose V \\\\cong (Z/pZ)n is an elementary abelian group. Since Z/pZ \\\\cong Fp, the finite field of p elements, we have V = (Z/pZ)n \\\\cong Fpn, hence V can be considered as an n-dimensional vector space over the field Fp. Note that an elementary abelian group does not in general have a distinguished basis: choice of isomorphism V \\\\overset{\\\\cong}{\\\\to} (Z/pZ)n corresponds to a choice of basis. To the observant reader, it may appear that Fpn has more structure than the group V, in particular that it has scalar multiplication in addition to (vector/group) addition. However, V as an abelian group has a unique Z-module structure where the action of Z corresponds to repeated addition, and this Z-module structure is consistent with the Fp scalar multiplication. That is, c*g = g + g + ... + g (c times) where c in Fp (considered as an integer with 0 ‚â§ c < p) gives V a natural Fp-module structure.  Automorphism group  As a vector space V has a basis {e1, ..., en} as described in the examples, if we take {v1, ..., vn} to be any n elements of V, then by linear algebra we have that the mapping T(ei) = vi extends uniquely to a linear transformation of V. Each such T can be considered as a group homomorphism from V to V (an endomorphism) and likewise any endomorphism of V can be considered as a linear transformation of V as a vector space. If we restrict our attention to automorphisms of V we have Aut(V) = { T : V -> V  ker T = 0 } = GLn(Fp), the general linear group of n √ó n invertible matrices on Fp. The automorphism group GL(V) = GLn(Fp) acts transitively on V \\\\ {0} (as is true for any vector space). This in fact characterizes elementary abelian groups among all finite groups: if G is a finite group with identity e such that Aut(G) acts transitively on G \\\\ {e}, then G is elementary abelian. (Proof: if Aut(G) acts transitively on G \\\\ {e}, then all nonidentity elements of G have the same (necessarily prime) order. Then G is a p-group. It follows that G has a nontrivial center, which is necessarily invariant under all automorphisms, and thus equals all of G.)  A generalisation to higher orders  It can also be of interest to go beyond prime order components to prime-power order. Consider an elementary abelian group G to be of type (p,p,...,p) for some prime p. A homocyclic group (of rank n) is an abelian group of type (m,m,...,m) i.e. the direct product of n isomorphic cyclic groups of order m, of which groups of type (pk,pk,...,pk) are a special case.  Related groups  The extra special groups are extensions of elementary abelian groups by a cyclic group of order p, and are analogous to the Heisenberg group.

Prentice held the NCAA Division I-A record for career rushing touchdowns until it was broken by Wisconsin's Montee Ball in 2012, and again by Keenan Reynolds of Navy in 2015. High school career Prentice attended duPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where he was first team All-District and second team All-State his senior year while running for 1,510 yards and 17 touchdowns. College career Prentice was redshirted his freshman year. The next year, Prentice had a very productive season even though he never broke into the starting line-up. In his first game, he ran for 102 yards and two touchdowns; for the season he ran for 601 yards on 123 carries and 12 touchdowns. In his sophomore year, Prentice earned a spot in Randy Walker's starting line-up and rushed for 1549 yards and 25 touchdowns. He was named first team All-Mid- American Conference and was one of eight semifinalists for the Doak Walker Award. In Prentice's junior year he ran for 1787 yards and 19 touchdowns while leading the RedHawks to a 10-1 season. Once again he was one of eight semifinalists for the Doak Walker Award. He was edged by Marshall's Chad Pennington in the MAC's Vern Smith Award for player of the year. His senior year was under a new head coach, Terry Hoeppner, who installed a more open passing attack rather than relying on the running game. Prentice ran for 1659 yards and 17 touchdowns. In the process he broke several Division I-A scoring records and was named third team All-American by the Associated Press. Prentice ended his career at Miami with 5,596 yards on 1,138 carries and numerous school, conference and NCAA records. At one point he recorded 862 consecutive touches without a fumble. On September 6, 2014 during halftime of the Eastern Kentucky game, Prentice became the fourth Miami RedHawk to have his football jersey retired. The previous three players were Ben Roethlisberger (#7), Bob Hitchens (#40), and John Pont (#42). =Notable games= ;vs. Akron (1999) Prentice exploded for 376 rushing yards in a 32-23 win against Akron. This set the Mid-American Conference record for most yards in a single game. At the time it was the 6th highest rushing total in Division I-A history. On his final carry of the game he broke Ricky Williams' career records both for points scored and total touchdowns with a 72-yard touchdown run. ;At North Carolina (1998) Prentice helped lead the RedHawks to a 13-10 upset of the #12 ranked North Carolina Tar Heels, rushing for 162 yards and a touchdown. Most of his yards came in the second half, including several carries on the last drive that led to a last-second game-winning field goal by John Scott. It was the first time in ten years that one player rushed for more than 150 yards on UNC. ;At Virginia Tech (1997) Prentice helped Miami to a 24-17 win over then-undefeated and twelfth-ranked Virginia Tech.

This species ranges throughout the southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas) and northern half of Mexico. Currently, western diamondback rattlesnakes are not threatened or endangered. Common names Other common names for this species include western diamond-backed rattlesnake, adobe snake, Arizona diamond rattlesnake, coon tail, desert diamond-back, desert diamond rattlesnake, fierce rattlesnake, spitting rattlesnake, buzz tail, Texan rattlesnake, Texas diamond-back, and Texas rattler.

Encyclopedia of Life Overall, it is probably the second largest-bodied species of rattlesnake, behind only its close cousin the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, and is also the second largest of North American venomous snakes (the bushmasters, which attain probably similar weights and greater total length, occur up as far as Nicaragua). The color pattern generally consists of a dusty-looking gray-brown ground color, but it may also be pinkish-brown, brick red, yellowish, pinkish, or chalky white. This ground color is overlaid dorsally with a series of 23-45 (mean, 36) dorsal body blotches that are dark gray-brown to brown in color.Ernst, CH; Ernst, EM. 2003. Snakes of the United States and Canada. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution. The first of these may be a pair of short stripes that extend backwards to eventually merge. Some of the first few blotches may be somewhat rectangular, but then become more hexagonal and eventually take on a distinctive diamond shape, hence the name \\"diamondback rattlesnake\\". The tail has two to eight (usually four to six) black bands separated by ash white or pale gray interspaces; this led to the nickname of \\"coon tail\\", though other species (e.g., Mojave rattlesnake) have similarly banded tails. Its postocular stripe is smoky gray or dark gray-brown and extends diagonally from the lower edge of the eye across the side of the head. This stripe is usually bordered below by a white stripe running from the upper preocular scale down to the supralabial scales just below and behind the eye. Its off-white belly is usually unmarked, its anal scale is undivided, and its dorsal scales are extremely keeled, often in rows of 25 to 27 near the midbody. A skeleton at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma The wide range of this species overlaps, or is close to, that of many others. It may be confused with them, but differences exist. The Mojave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus), also has tail rings, but the black rings are narrow relative to the pale ones. The timber rattlesnake (C. horridus), has no tail rings. In the western rattlesnake (C. oreganus), the pale tail rings are the same color as the ground. The tail of the black-tailed rattlesnake (C. molossus), is a uniform black, or has indistinct tail rings. The Mexican west coast rattlesnake (C. basiliscus), also has a mostly dark tail with obscure or absent rings. The tiger rattlesnake, (C. tigris), has a relatively small head and large rattle along with a dorsal pattern consisting more of crossbands. The Middle American rattlesnake (C. simus), has a generally uniform gray tail without any rings, as well as a pair of distinctive paravertebral stripes running down the neck. Members of the genus Sistrurus lack tail rings and have enlarged head plates. Distribution =Geographic range= It is found in the United States from central Arkansas to southeastern and Central California, south into Mexico as far as northern Sinaloa, Hidalgo and northern Veracruz. Disjunct populations exist in southern Veracruz and southeastern Oaxaca. The type locality given is \\"Indianola\\" (Indianola, Calhoun County, Texas). In the United States, it occurs in central and western Arkansas, Oklahoma excluding the northeast, north-central region and the panhandle, Texas excluding the northern panhandle and the east, southern and central New Mexico and Arizona, extreme southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and in southeastern California on either side of the Chocolate Mountains. Records from extreme southern Kansas (Cowley and Sumner Counties) may be based on a natural occurrence of the species, while multiple records from near Kanopolis Reservoir in Ellsworth County seem to indicate a viable (although isolated) population. In Mexico, it occurs in Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, extreme northeastern Baja California, northern Sinaloa, northeastern Durango, Zacatecas, most of San Luis Potos√≠, northern Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Quer√©taro. Specimens have been collected in the mountains northwest of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, on numerous occasions, but have not been reported there since the 1940s. This species has also been reported on a number of islands in the Gulf of California, including San Pedro M√°rtir, Santa Mar√≠a (Sinaloa), T√≠buron and the Turner Islands.The Tortuga Island diamond rattlesnake is also a subspecies. =Habitat= Its habitats range from flat coastal plains to steep rocky canyons and hillsides; it is associated with many different vegetation types, including desert, sandy creosote areas, mesquite grassland, desert scrub, and pine-oak forests. It is common to see the western diamondback on rural blacktop roads in early evening, because of the heat retention of these surfaces, as ambient temperatures drops. Behavior C. atrox, patternless specimen C. atrox is solitary except during the mating season. Usually inactive between late October and early March, these ectotherms occasionally may be seen basking in the sun on warm winter days. In the winter, they hibernate or brumate in caves or burrows, sometimes with many other species of snakes. Life expectancy is more than 20 years. They are poor climbers. Natural predators include raptors such as hawks and eagles, roadrunners, wild hogs, and other snakes. When threatened, they usually coil and rattle to warn aggressors. They are one of the more aggressive rattlesnake species in the US in the way that they stand their ground when confronted by a foe. If rattling does not work, then the snake will strike in defense. Prey A comprehensive study by Beavers (1976) on the prey of C. atrox in Texas showed, by weight, 94.8% of their prey consisted of small mammals. According to Pisani and Stephenson (1991), who conducted a study of the stomach contents of C. atrox in the fall and spring of Oklahoma, mammalian prey included prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii), pocket gophers (Geomys bursarius and Cratogeomys castanops), voles (Microtus ochrogaster), woodrats (Neotoma floridana), pocket mice (Perognathus hispidus and P. flavescens), white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus), Old World rats and mice (Rattus norvegicus and Mus ssp.), harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis), fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), ground squirrels (Spermophilus spilosoma), rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), and an unidentified mole species. Klauber mentioned large specimens are capable of swallowing adult cottontail rabbits and even adult jackrabbits, although he figured the latter required confirmation.Klauber LM. (1997). Rattlesnakes: Their Habitats, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. 2nd ed. First published in 1956, 1972. University of California Press, Berkeley. . Birds, lizards, and mice are also preyed upon, with lizards mostly being eaten by young snakes. Avian prey include mockingbirds (Mimidae), quail, a nearly full-grown Gambel's quail, a burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), a fledgling horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) a black-throated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), and an eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Lizard prey include a whiptail lizard (Cnemidophorus), spiny lizards (Sceloporus), a Texas banded gecko (Coleonyx brevis), and a side-blotched lizard (Uta palmeri). One case reported by Vorhies (1948) involved a juvenile specimen that had attempted to eat a horned lizard (Phrynosoma solare), but died after the lizard's horns had punctured its esophagus, leaving the lizard stuck there. Hermann (1950) reported C. atrox also feeds on lubber grasshoppers (Brachystola magna). Klauber (1972) once found a single specimen in which the stomach contents included grasshoppers, beetles, and ants. However, mammal hairs and an iguanid lizard were also found in the same stomach, which made it more likely that the insects had first been eaten by the mammal or the lizard before they had been eaten by the snake. They hunt (or ambush prey) at night or in the early morning. These snakes can go for up to two years without food in the wild. A 5¬Ω-month starvation study showed the snakes reduced energy expenditures by an average of 80% over the length of the study. The snakes also feed from within on energy-rich lipid stores. The most interesting finding was the snakes grew during the study, indicating while the snake's mass was shrinking, it was putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone. A key participant in the food chain, it is an important predator of many small rodents, rabbits, and birds. In turn, it is preyed upon by a variety of larger mammals and birds, such as coyotes, foxes, hawks, and owls. Crotalus atrox can be active at any time of the day or night when conditions are favorable. It is primarily diurnal and crepuscular in spring and fall and becomes primarily nocturnal and crepuscular during the hot summer months.Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) ‚Äì Reptiles of Arizona. Reptilesofaz.org. Retrieved on 2016-12-26. Venom C. atrox Like most other American pit vipers, the venom contains proteolytic enzymes. Proteolytic venoms are concentrated secretions that destroy tissues as a result of catabolism of structural and other proteins, which help in disabling prey. The venom of C. atrox is primarily hemotoxic, affecting mainly the blood vessels, blood cells and the heart. The venom contains hemorrhagic components called zinc metalloproteinases. The venom also contains cytotoxins and myotoxins which destroy cells and muscles, adding to the damage to the cardiovascular system. In addition to hemorrhage, venom metalloproteinases induce myonecrosis (skeletal muscle damage), which seems to be secondary to the ischemia that ensues in muscle tissue as a consequence of bleeding and reduced perfusion. Microvascular disruption by metalloproteinases also impairs skeletal muscle regeneration, being thereby responsible for fibrosis and permanent tissue loss. General local effects include pain, heavy internal bleeding, severe swelling, severe muscle damage, bruising, blistering, and necrosis; systemic effects are variable and not specific, but may include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, and convulsions. Bleeding caused by hemorrhagins is a major clinical effect that can be fatal.Clinical Toxinology Resource (Crotalus atrox). Toxinology.com. Retrieved on 2016-12-26. This species has values of 2.72 mg/kg intravenous, 20 mg/kg intramuscular and 18.5 mg/kg subcutaneous, which is far less toxic than many other rattlesnakes.Sean Thomas LD50. Seanthomas.net. Retrieved on 2016-12-26.Fry, Bryan Grieg. LD50 Menu. venomdoc.com However, because of its large venom glands and specialized fangs, the western diamondback rattlesnake can deliver a large amount of venom in a single bite. The average venom yield per bite is usually between 250 and 350 mg, with a maximum of 700‚Äì800 mg.Brown JH. (1973). Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. LCCCN 73‚Äì229. . Severe envenomation is rare but possible, and can be lethal. Mortality rate of untreated bites is between 10 and 20%. Reproduction A male Crotalus atrox with a pair of intromittent organs called hemipenes, used for reproduction Rattlesnakes, including C. atrox, are viviparous. Gestation lasts six or seven months, and broods average about a dozen young. However, the young stay with the mother for only a few hours before they set off on their own to hunt and find cover, so that the mortality rate is very high. Mating occurs in the fall, and the females give birth to as many as 25 young, which may be as long as . The young are fully capable of delivering a venomous bite from the moment they are born. Conservation status This species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2001). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution or presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend was stable when assessed in 2007. They are also heavily collected from the wild, frequently being drawn out of their hiding places with gasoline and used in rattlesnake roundups, where they are killed for food, skins and entertainment. This Western diamondback rattlesnake may be the most common rattlesnake species found in homes and in direct conflict with human development in the American southwest, in particularly in the rapidly expanding metro areas of Phoenix and Tucson.L.

There are about 1,200 full-time students enrolled on the Salem campus and 2,800 worldwide. Corban is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, and athletically is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference.  History  The institution was established in 1935 in Phoenix, Arizona as the Phoenix Bible Institute by Evangelist Leland Entrekin and Roy Bancroft. The college moved in 1946 to Oakland, California and took the name Western Baptist Bible College, affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC). In 1969, the college moved to Salem, Oregon. In July 1969, the administrators paid $5,000 as a down payment for the 100 acre campus. The down payment was then adopted as the college's new address: 5000 Deer Park Drive. The transaction was personally overseen and signed by then Oregon Governor Tom McCall. The school shortened its name to Western Baptist College in 1978. In the 1970s, Western added liberal arts to its ministry programs. Dr. Thomas Younger, the college's sixth president, helped institute the two of the university's most successful schools: the School of Education and the School of Business. Reno Hoff became the president of the institution in 1999, replacing David Miller. In 2001, Beth Bartosik became the first Fulbright Scholar in school history. Corban received a $2.1 million donation in 2001 for a new performing arts center and chapel, the largest donation ever for the school. In 2004, U.S. News and World Report ranked the school as the eighth best in the western United States for comprehensive colleges, and ninth the following year. The college name was changed from Western Baptist College to Corban College on May 7, 2005. \\"Corban,\\" a Hebrew word, means \\"a gift dedicated to God.\\" Later in 2005 the college opened Davidson Hall, a residence hall, and had their largest incoming class to that point with 207 freshman and an overall enrollment of 860. In 2006, U.S. News & World Report listed the school at eight, the fifth year in a row the school was in the top ten. As of 2009, the college had an endowment of about $3 million. In 2013, U.S. News Best Colleges listed Corban in its Top 10 for the West for the 13th year in a row. The university was ranked as the fifth best among western regional colleges by U.S. News & World Report in 2016. Corban University Clocktower Corban accepts Christian students. Students are required to provide their testimony of their saving relationship with Jesus Christ in their application to Corban. In the summer of 2007, Corban's name was extended to Corban College and Graduate School in order to reflect the institution's graduate programs in education and business. In honor of the institution's 75th anniversary, the school became Corban University on May 1, 2010. Dr. Reno Hoff retired as president on June 30, 2013, and was succeeded by Dr. Sheldon C. Nord as the university's 10th president.  Academics  The university offers over 50 undergraduate programs and seven graduate programs. All Corban undergraduate students, regardless of major, take a minimum of 12-semester units of Bible and theology classes. All courses are taught from a biblical perspective.  Campus  Residence hall at the university Psalm Performing Arts Center Corban University Library Corban's campus is on a wooded hillside on the outskirts of Salem, and the college owns approximately of the wooded hillside. The trees are mainly Douglas Fir and Oregon White Oak with a smattering of Big Leaf Maple. The site was previously the site of the Oregon Institute for Deaf-Mutes and then the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital. Some buildings on campus date to those facilities. Over one hundred bird species have been identified on campus. The school also operated the Corban School of Ministry in Tacoma, Washington, after the Northwest Baptist Seminary was merged with Corban in 2010. The Tacoma campus was sold shortly after the purchase, allowing the university to expand the Salem campus and house the School of Ministry in Salem once again. =Residence Halls= Freshmen and Sophomores, unless over the age of 21 or are married, must live on campus. There are six residence halls: Aagard, Farrar, Prewitt, Van Gilder, Balyo, and Davidson. There are also apartments on the campus for academic juniors and seniors. Laundry is free for all on campus students =Performing Arts Center= Also on campus is the 700-seat Psalm Performing Arts Center opened in 2005 at a cost of $3.7 million. The building also houses practice rooms and classrooms for performing arts majors. =Academic Buildings= The campus' main academic building, the Academic Center, houses the university's 80,000+ volume library. The library also has study rooms and conference rooms available to students throughout the day, along with multiple study areas and computer labs with free printing. Additionally, the library houses the Prewitt-Allen Archaeological Museum, with over 900 artifacts and replicas from the Middle East and Greece. The rare collection displayed also contains authentic and original scrolls of the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. The Academic Center also holds all professors offices, organized by program, with the exception of performing arts. As a side note, all Corban University full-time professors are required to have at least eight office hours per week. The building also has 40-seat classrooms and science labs. Younger Center The university rarely holds classes over 50 students, with a student to faculty ratio of just 12:1. Traditional classrooms and small lecture halls are found around campus in Caulkins Hall, the Pavilion, and the Younger Center. The Younger Center also houses additional study areas for students, a tutoring center, and the university Student Support Center. =Main administrative building= Schimmel Hall The University holds most administrative offices in Schimmel Hall, a three-story building built in the late 19th century. The Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, along with academic services, financial services, enrollment, and marketing offices are all found in this building. =Dining areas= The Travis Memorial Dining Hall, and extension of Schimmel Hall, offers buffet-style meals throughout the day and outdoor patio seating. The Pavilion also houses the Common Grounds coffee shop, open nearly 18 hours a day with snacks, pastries, take-out meals and Starbucks coffee. The Provisions on Demand, found in the university's library, sells snacks, drinks, take-out meals and coffee. =Other buildings= Music Houses A & B house the offices of music professors, along with multiple music lesson rooms and private practice rooms for music majors. The Student Life House, formerly the President's Residence, holds all offices for Student Life staff members, including the Vice President and Dean of Students of the university. The Athletics Offices House has offices of university coaches and athletic directors. The Barn is a building where students can go to participate in workshops about technical and visual arts. =Athletic center= The C. E. Jeffers Sports Center is a multi-purpose 1,600 seat sports arena in Salem, Oregon which is home to the Corban Warriors. It was opened in 1979 and houses the basketball, volleyball, and wrestling teams. The student section, which is reserved for \\"Fanatics,\\" is small but passionate. The building namesake, Clarence E. Jeffers, was a Corban graduate and building contractor. The building also contains the campus' fitness center and athletic trainer offices. Athletics Corban University teams, nicknamed athletically as the Warriors, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, track & field, and wrestling, while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, lacrosse, track & field, volleyball, beach volleyball, and wrestling .

Gilbert (born December 27, 1936) is an American literary critic and poet who has published in the fields of feminist literary criticism, feminist theory, and psychoanalytic criticism. She is best known for her collaborative critical work with Susan Gubar, with whom she co-authored, among other works, The Madwoman in the Attic (1979). Madwoman in the Attic is widely recognized as a text central to second-wave feminism. She is Professor Emerita of English at the University of California, Davis. She lives in Berkeley, California and, until 2008, in Paris, France. Her husband, Elliot L. Gilbert, was Chair of the Department of English at University of California, Davis, until his death in 1991. She also had a long-term relationship with David Gale, mathematician at University of California, Berkeley, until his death in 2008.  Academia  Gilbert received her B.A. from Cornell University, her M.A. from New York University, and her Ph.D. in English literature from Columbia University in 1968. She has taught at California State University, Hayward, Williams College, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University, and Indiana University. She held the C. Barnwell Straut Chair of English at Princeton University from 1985 until 1989. According to reports in The New York Times, Gilbert, along with Emory Elliott, Valerie Smith, and Margaret Doody all resigned from Princeton in 1989. The reports suggest that the four were unhappy with the leniency shown to Thomas McFarland after he was accused of sexual misconduct. McFarland was initially put on a one-year suspension, but eventually took early retirement after these resignations and threats of student boycotts. She was named the inaugural M. H. Abrams Distinguished Visiting Professor at Cornell University for spring 2007, and the Lurie Distinguished Visiting Professor in the Creative Writing MFA program at San Jose State University in 2009.  Awards  Gilbert was president of the Modern Language Association in 1996. She has been a recipient of Guggenheim, Rockefeller, NEH, and Soros Foundation fellowships and has held residencies at Yaddo, MacDowell, Bellagio, Camargo, and Bogliasco. In 1988 she was awarded a D. Litt. by Wesleyan University. In 1990 she was a co-recipient (with Karl Shapiro) of the International Poetry Forum's Charity Randall Award. More recently, she has won a Patterson Prize (for Ghost Volcano), an American Book Award (for Kissing the Bread), the John Ciardi Award for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry (from the Italian-American Foundation), the Premio Lerici Pea awarded by the Liguri nel Mondo association, and several awards from Poetry magazine. In 2004 she was awarded the degree of Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2012, she and her longtime collaborator Susan Gubar were awarded the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award of the National Book Critics Circle. In 2017 she received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Harvard University.  Collaboration with Susan Gubar  Gilbert and Gubar met in the early 1970s at Indiana University. In 1974, they collaborated to co-teach a course on literature in English by women; their lectures led to the manuscript for Madwoman in the Attic. They have continued to co-author and co-edit, and have been jointly awarded several academic distinctions. Notably, they were jointly named Ms. magazine's \\"Woman of the Year\\" in 1986 for their work as head editors of The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women: The Traditions in English. Because of the success of their joint publications, Gilbert and Gubar are often cited together in the fields of Feminist literary criticism and Feminist theory.  Feminist literary criticism and theory  Gilbert's critical and theoretical works, particularly those co-authored with Susan Gubar, are generally identified as texts within the realm of second-wave feminism. As such, they represent part of a concerted effort to move beyond the simple assimilationist theories of first-wave feminism, either by rejecting entirely the given, oppressive, patriarchal, male-dominated order of society, or by seeking to reform that order. Gilbert's texts, in turn, lay themselves open to many of the criticisms levelled by third-wave feminism, or thinkers who regard patriarchy not as an integrated and foundational system, but a set of repeated practices which may vary over time and space. Gilbert is often said to have found her theoretical roots in the earlier 1970s works of Ellen Moers and Elaine Showalter, as the basic premise of her thought is that women writers share a set of similar experiences and that male oppression or patriarchy is everywhere essentially the same. = \\"The Anxiety of Authorship\\" = In The Madwoman in the Attic, Gilbert and Gubar take the Oedipal model of the anxiety of influence developed by literary critic Harold Bloom, centred around writers' Oedipal fear and jealousy for their perceived literary \\"fore-fathers\\", and adapt it to their own purposes as feminist critics.J. Childers ed., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) pp. 13-14 According to Bloom's theory, the developing writer must struggle to break free from his most immediate, direct influences, to form his own voice, and to break away from identification to find his own imaginative space.H. Bloom, The Anxiety of Influence (1973) p. 147 Gilbert and Gubar extend this male-oriented model to incorporate a female \\"Anxiety of Authorship\\",J. Childers ed., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p.14 whereby lack of predecessors makes the very act of writing problematic. Where Bloom wonders how the male author can find a voice that is his own, Gilbert and Gubar ‚Äì building on Virginia Woolf's analysis of the \\"difficulty...that they had no tradition behind them\\"V. Woolf, A Room of One's Own (1929) p. 114 ‚Äì emphasise the problem a woman writer may have in seeing herself as possessing a literary voice at all, given the absence of a maternal precursor.S. Juhasz, A Desire for Women (2003) p. 65 Where Bloom finds aggression and competition between male literary figures in terms of self-consciously feeling influenced and desiring to be influential, the \\"anxiety of authorship\\" identifies a \\"secret sisterhood\\" of role models within the Western tradition who show that women can write, the recuperation of the tradition of which becomes a feminist project.E. D. Ermath, Sequel to History (1992) p. 172 However, these models too may be \\"infected\\" with a lack of confidence, and with internal contradiction of ambition, hampered by the culturally induced assumption of \\"the patriarchal authority of art.\\"Quoted in S. M. Butler, Travel Narratives in Dialogue (2008) p. 74 In later works, the pair explore \\"the 'double bind' of the woman poet...the contradictions between her vocation and her gender\\" (Shakespeare's Sisters), as well as the development (in the wake of Sylvia Plath) of a new genre of 'mother poets'.C.

It was only released in Japan and North America. Gameplay Most of the game takes place in dungeons, with a heavy emphasis on puzzles. The player takes on the role of a young adventurer who can have up to two jades, creatures that perform tasks such as healing or long range attacks, following the player character at one time. There are five dungeons in the game: The Tower of Light, Ancient Ruins, the Ice Castle, Droog Volcano, and Platinum. The player starts out in the town of Arcs; there is only one other town, Toronto. In Toronto there is a battle arena in which the player can fight for money. The player can also bet on other competitors. The video game features several kinds of weapons including bows, boomerangs, swords, axes, and flails. Defeated enemies yield gold. Throughout the game the player can acquire better armor and weapons to increase his defensive and offensive capabilities, similar to The Legend of Zelda series. The jades that accompany the protagonist can level up by picking up blue 'XP' orbs that are dropped randomly by defeated enemies. Plot Remeer's father, the last of the dragon warriors, was sent on a quest to find the last of the dragons terrorizing the village. His father never returned. Years later Remeer sets out on his own journey to find out what happened to his father. Remeer is joined by his four friends: Kashian (a bounty hunter), Barness (a spiritual guru), Rein (a warrior), and Ferris (a witch). Each help him as he makes his way through the five dungeons in the land. Remeer (or its equivalent 'Lemele') is used for prominent characters in two more video games developed by Produce! and published by Enix, The 7th Saga and Mystic Ark. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that Brain Lord \\"strikes a nice balance between the action and RPG elements, and will probably have a wider appeal.\\" They also praised the \\"atmospheric\\" music.

It was sculpted by Reinhold Begas. It is one of 250 memorials to Bismarck worldwide. This memorial in Berlin portrays Bismarck in his ceremonial garb as Chancellor standing above statues of: *Atlas, showing Germany's world power status at the end of the 19th century; *Siegfried, forging a sword to show Germany's strong industrial and military might; *Germania pinning underfoot a panther, symbolizing the suppression of discord and rebellion; *a sibyl reclining on a sphinx and reading the book of history. The statue, along with the famous Berlin victory column, were once located in front of the Reichstag building before they were moved in 1938 by Adolf Hitler in his project to recast Berlin as Welthauptstadt Germania. The statue weathered a marked amount of shrapnel damage during World War II, but has survived largely intact to the present day. In fact, the move probably saved the monument from total destruction, as the old garden in front of the Reichstag was completely obliterated in the war.

He was also Margrave of Camerino, and the son-in-law of Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum, the most powerful man in Rome. Life He first appears as a page to Guy III of Spoleto at the Battle on the Trebbia in 889. He may have later been the count of Fermo, but whatever the case, he succeeded to Spoleto after murdering Duke Guy IV. He was recognised soon by King Berengar I, with whom he fought the Magyars in 899 or 900. Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, in the Alban Hills southeast of Rome served as palatine iudex (or leader of the militia)Hinson, E. Glenn. The Church Triumphant: A History of Christianity Up to 1300, Mercer University Press, 1995, p. 358 for Emperor Louis III. He remained in Rome, commanding a group of soldiers after the emperor‚Äôs return to Provence in 902, and was prominent in the overthrow of Antipope Christopher in January 904. Together with Alberic, they secured the succession of Pope Sergius III. Under Sergius, Theophylact became both sacri palatii vestararius and magister militum. As the first oversaw appointments, and the second supervised the soldiers, Theophylact had effective control of the city.Williams, George L., Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants Of The Popes (2004), p. 11 Theophylact was married to Theodora. They had two daughters: Marozia and Theodora. In 909, Marozia married Alberic. This alliance with the Tusculani was very advantageous, and he received the title of \\"patrician of the Romans,\\" patricius Romanorum. Although Alberic was a supporter of Pope Sergius, around 906, when the Pope agreed to crown Berengar Holy Roman Emperor, Alberic allied with his neighbour, Adalbert II, margrave of Tuscany. Together their combined forces blocked the road, preventing Berengar from reaching Rome. Alberic was margrave of Camerino,Mann, Horace K., The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages, Vol. IV: The Popes in the Days of Feudal Anarchy, 891-999 (1910), p. 154 and Duke of Spoleto. He was one of the leaders of the Christian League which defeated the Saracens at the Battle of the Garigliano in June 915.Squatriti, Paolo. \\"Garigliano, Battle of\\", Medieval Italy: an Encyclopedia, (Christopher Kleinhenz, ed.), Routledge, 2004, , p. 398 He led his troops from Spoleto and Camerino with those of Theophylact of Tusculum to join with Pope John X‚Äîand his contingent from Latium and Adalbert of Tuscany‚Äîand Nicholas Picingli, the strategos of Bari, leading the Byzantine forces and Lombard and Greek princes of the South: Guaimar II of Salerno, Landulf I of Benevento, Atenulf II of Capua, John I and the later Docibilis II of Gaeta, and Gregory IV and the later John II of Naples. Even Berengar sent a contingent from the March of Friuli. The battle went famously and many a petty prince received titles of great honour. Alberic was appointed the \\"consul of the Romans\\" in 917. He became, however, a tyrant in the Eternal City and people and pope expelled him. He was subsequently murdered in Orte between 924 or 926, probably because of his reliance on marauding Hungarians who supported his power. The dates of his downfall and death are as uncertain as those of his rise. He last appears in a datable document of 917, the Liber largitorius of Farfa Abbey. He had four or five sons by Marozia: * Pope John XI (b.910) * Alberic II, who was later prince of Rome * Constantino (d. after January 14, 945) * Sergio, bishop of Nepi (d. before 963) * David or Deodatus, who was the father of Pope Benedict VII Liutprand of Cremona says that Marozia's first son, who later became Pope John XI, was illegitimate, and the result of an affair with Pope Sergius. Subsequent commentators have repeated this report. Edward Gibbon says that the birth of John in 910, after her marriage to Alberic, would seem to indicate that Sergius was not the father.Gibbon, Edward, Milman, H. H., The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, with Notes Vol. 3 (1841), pg. 518 Horace Mann says that the report \\"...must be regarded as highly doubtful,\\" and are assertions only made by bitter or ill-informed adversaries, and inconsistent with what is said by reliable contemporaries.Mann, Horace. \\"Pope Sergius III.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13.

Holden's art focuses on the usage of many kinds of visual art media, and on seeing how they relate to each other with a special interest in the charged spaces between artistic media, genres, and subcultures. New Media In the inaugural exhibition in 2013 of UNAMERICAN UNFAMOUSUNAMERICAN UNFAMOUS at Ryerson University Image Centre at the Ryerson Image Centre, Holden worked with archive photographs and snap shots submitted by the general public via social media, along with pulsating film leader loops, in a large scale media wall composition. The public was asked to nominate their \\"favourite unfamous unAmericans\\" for inclusion in the work. The various media were composed using a musical analogy for over-all structure, where the visuals were intended to be \\"listened to\\" rather than viewed in the normal sense. Hundreds of randomization algorithms were also included in the work's code, so that the work's creation wasn't 100% completed until the moment it was viewed, and it could never be viewed the same way twice. Media MediatedMediated Algorithms by Matthew Ryan Smith in Afterimage, the journal of media arts and cultural criticism, pages 20-21 (2013) is an ongoing series of new media works, net art works, and chromogenic prints. They interrelate in spite of their disparate natures as either ephemeral time-based net art works and installations, or more traditional art objects.

The song tells the nonsensical story of an old woman who swallows increasingly large animals, each to catch the previously swallowed animal, but dies after swallowing a horse. The humour of the song stems from the absurdity that the woman is able to inexplicably and impossibly swallow animals of preposterous sizes, suggesting that she is both superhuman and immortal. However, the addition of a horse is finally enough to kill her. Her inability to survive after swallowing the horse is an event that abruptly and unexpectedly applies real-world logic to the song, directly contradicting her formerly established logic-defying animal-swallowing capability. There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics, especially for the description of swallowing each animal. The spider and fly are described in each verse, but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird. Three versions of the rhyme were collected in the journal Hoosier Folklore in December 1947, beginning respectively \\"There was an old lady ‚Äî she swallowed a fly\\", \\"Poor little old lady, she swallowed a fly\\" and \\"A little old lady swallowed a fly\\". All three list the progression from fly to spider, bird, cat, dog and cow, finishing with the horse, with variations to the rhymes for each animal. The definitive version was written by Rose Bonne (lyrics) and Canadian/English folk artist Alan Mills and copyrighted in 1952. At that time it was entitled simply \\"I Know an Old Lady.\\"Catalog of Copyright Entries, Third Series, Volume 6, Part 5B, No. 1, January‚ÄìJune, 1952 (US Copyright Office), p. 86. The submission date is given as March 28, 1952. The 1954 edition relists it, providing the same date and giving Alan Mills as a pseudonym for Albert Miller. A widely distributed version of the song was released on Brunswick Records in 1953, where it was sung by Burl Ives. Ives' rendition appears on his album, Folk Songs, Dramatic and Humorous‚Äîwhich debuted in late summer, 1953.Decca DL 5467, reviewed in Billboard, September 12, 1953, p. 36. The record label also indicates the Mills-Bonne credit. The 1961 illustrated book by Rose Bonne also indicates that the lyrics are hers, whereas the music was composed by Alan Mills.For a further example remaining in print, see Lyrics The following is one form of the lyrics, that are representative of the nature of this cumulative lyric: There was an old lady who swallowed a fly :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! :She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a bird; How absurd to swallow a bird! :She swallowed the bird to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! :She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a cat; Fancy that! She swallowed a cat! :She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, :She swallowed the bird to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! :She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady that swallowed a dog; What a hog, to swallow a dog! :She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, :She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, :She swallowed the bird to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! :She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a goat; She just opened her throat and swallowed a goat! :She swallowed the goat to catch the dog, :She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, :She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, :She swallowed the bird to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! :She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die! There was an old lady who swallowed a cow; I don't know how she swallowed a cow! :She swallowed the cow to catch the goat, :She swallowed the goat to catch the dog, :She swallowed the dog to catch the cat, :She swallowed the cat to catch the bird, :She swallowed the bird to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her! :She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; :I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she‚Äôs dead There was an old lady who swallowed a horse; :...She's dead, of course! Parody The song \\"I know an old sysop who loaded Novell\\" is based on the same principle of agglomeration but lacks a punchline. Representative renditions * Pete Seeger released a version on the Birds Bugs and Little Fishes LP (Folkways Records FC7610) in 1955 * Composer Alan Mills recorded a version for Scholastic Records released in 1956 on Animals, Vol.1 * The song was used for an animated cartoon sung by Burl Ives. Ives's version included an extra verse, involving a pig, following that involving the goat and preceding that involving the cow. * The song's lyrics were used as the text of a children's book by Simms Taback. A video version of the song by the publisher was sung by Cyndi Lauper. Both these versions also feature the animals and the artist talking. The animals, when introduced, are shown surrounded by things that represent them; for example, the cow stands in the middle of one of the pages surrounded by flowers, a carton of milk, a Hershey milk chocolate bar, some different types of cheese, a bar of butter and containers of cream cheese and sour cream. So the famous moral is \\"never swallow a horse\\". The Simms Taback version does not feature the goat after the dog and skips straight to the verse about the cow being swallowed by the old lady. * The song and its title are the basis of a children's book that has been in print since the early 1970s, from illustrator Pam Adams. * The song has been adapted into a stage musical written by Steven Lee and produced by The People's Theatre Company. * A version of this song was recorded by San Francisco punk band, Flipper and released on a 7\\" single. * The song was performed by Judy Collins and Statler and Waldorf with shadow puppets, on a 1977 episode of The Muppet Show. This was parodied in one scene in the 2005 film The Brothers Grimm. * Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) said the first lyrics of the song after he learned of his condition in the 1986 version of The Fly. * The song appeared in an episode of Desperate Housewives in the season 5 finale. * In a PBS television concert Peter, Paul & Mommy, Too, Paul Stookey and Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary perform this song. * In Disney/Pixar's A Bug's Life, a cricket mentions the first verse of this song at the bar. * In an Arthur episode entitled \\"Emily Swallows a Horse,\\" the song is used as an analogy for the increasingly complex and incredible lies that the character must use to cover her original falsehood. * The lyrics about the bird catching the spider form part of the theme song for the popular children's show Round the Twist. * In Mr. Holland's Opus, Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is playing and singing the song to his wife and son. * The Bill Nye the Science Guy episode \\"Food Web\\" featured a segment called \\"Uncle Fran's Playhouse\\" which featured part of this song. * One of Russell Bates's rejected scripts for Star Trek: The Animated Series, \\"The Patient Parasites,\\" when it was finally published in Star Trek: The New Voyages 2, included the song's two earliest verses, those involving the fly and the spider in that order, in the \\"tag,\\" or \\"epilogue,\\" of the story. * In The Kids in the Hall sketch \\"Needed Elsewhere\\", a coked-up Scott Thompson yells at a cat off-camera. When one of the guests replies that she thought he had a dog, he briefly recites a paraphrasing of the song. * Pete Seeger did a parody of the song as \\"I know an old lady who swallowed a lie\\" during a 1980 concert at the Sanders Theater in Boston. In the song, towards the very end, she coughs up the lie. (SOURCE: CD \\" Pete Seeger Singalong\\" 1981. Smithsonian Folkways Records) * On a Sesame Street episode, the lyrics of that song were changed to \\"perhaps she'll cry\\" in order to make the song tamer for children, with Telly singing that repeated refrain including the final line: \\"She cried, of course\\". * A derivative version by post-punk death rockers Death Valley High was included on the 2016 LP titled \\"CVLT AS FVK\\".

Flack (born May 30, 1931) is an American artist. Her work pioneered the art genre of photorealism; her work encompasses painting, sculpture, and photography. Flack has numerous academic degrees, including both a graduate and an honorary doctorate degree from Cooper Union in New York City. Additionally she has a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from Yale University and attended New York University Institute of Fine Arts where she studied art history. In May 2015, Flack received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Clark University, where she also gave a commencement address. Audrey Flack's work is displayed in several major museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Flack's photorealistic paintings were the first such paintings to be purchased for the Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs permanent collection, and her legacy as a photorealist lives on to influence many American and International artists today. J. B. Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky, organized a retrospective of her work, and Flack‚Äôs pioneering efforts into the world of photorealism popularized the genre to the extent that it remains today. Early life and education Flack attended New York's High School of Music & Art.\\"Oral history interview with Audrey Flack,\\" Smithsonian Institution Archives of American Art website (2009 Feb. 16). She studied fine arts in New York from 1948 to 1953, studying under Josef Albers among others. She earned a graduate degree and received an honorary doctorate from Cooper Union in New York City, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Yale University. She studied art history at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. * 1953 New York University Institute of Fine Arts, New York City * 1952 BFA, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut * 1948-51 Cooper Union, New York City Career Audrey Flack, Banana Split Sundae, 1981. Minneapolis Institute of Art Flack's early work in the 1950s was abstract expressionist; one such painting paid tribute to Franz Kline. The ironic kitsch themes in her early work influenced Jeff Koons. But gradually, Flack became a New Realist and then evolved into photorealism during the 1960s. Her move to the photorealist style was in part because she wanted her art to communicate to the viewer. She was the first photorealist painter to be added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in 1966. Between 1976 and 1978 she painted her Vanitas series, including the piece Marilyn. The critic Graham Thompson wrote, \\"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism, radical realism, or hyper- realism and painters like Richard Estes, Chuck Close, and Audrey Flack as well, often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.\\"Thompson, Graham: American Culture in the 1980s (Twentieth Century American Culture), Edinburgh University Press, 2007 Art critic Robert C. Morgan writes in The Brooklyn Rail about Flack's 2010 exhibition at Gary Snyder Project Space, Audrey Flack Paints a Picture, \\"She has taken the signs of indulgence, beauty, and excess and transformed them into deeply moving symbols of desire, futility, and emancipation.\\" In the early 1980s Flack's artistic medium shifted from painting to sculpture. She describes this shift as a desire for \\"something solid, real, tangible. Something to hold and to hold on to.\\" Flack has claimed to have found the photorealist movement too restricting, and now gains much of her inspiration from Baroque art. Flack is currently represented by the Louis K. Meisel Gallery and Hollis Taggart Galleries. Her work is held in the collections of museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Allen Memorial Art Museum, and the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, Australia. She was awarded the St. Gaudens Medal from Cooper Union, and the honorary Albert Dome professorship from Bridgeport University. She is an honorary professor at George Washington University, is currently a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania and has taught and lectured extensively both nationally, and internationally. In 1986 Flack published Art & Soul: Notes on Creating, a book expressing some of her thoughts on being an artist. Flack lives and works in New York City and Long Island. Photorealism Audrey Flack is best known for her photo-realist paintings and was one of the first artists to use photographs as the basis for painting. The genre, taking its cues from Pop Art, incorporates depictions of the real and the regular, from advertisements to cars to cosmetics. Flack's work brings in everyday household items like tubes of lipstick, perfume bottles, Hispanic Madonnas, and fruit. These inanimate objects often disturb or crowd the pictorial space, which are often composed as table-top still lives. Flack often brings in actual accounts of history into her photorealist paintings, such as World War II' (Vanitas) and Kennedy Motorcade. Women were frequently the subject of her photo-realist paintings. Sculpture Sculpture by Audrey Flack in New Orleans. Statue of Catherine of Braganza, in Lisbon ‚Äî scale model for a much larger one planned for Queens NYC, never built. Audrey Flack's sculpture is often overlooked in light of her better-known Photorealist paintings. In this interview, Flack discusses the fact that she is self-taught in sculpture. She incorporates religion and mythology into her sculpture rather than the historical or everyday subjects of her paintings. Her sculptures often demonstrate a connection to the female form, including a series of diverse, heroic women and goddess figures. These depictions of women differ from those of traditional femininity, but rather are athletic, older, and strong. As Flack describes them: \\"they are real yet idealized... the 'goddesses in everywoman.'\\" In the early 1990s, Flack was commissioned by a group called Friends of Queen Catherine to create a monumental bronze statue of Catherine of Braganza, in whose honor the borough of Queens is named. The statue, which would have been roughly the height of a nine-story building, was meant to be installed on the East River shore in the Hunters Point area of Long Island City, across from the United Nations. The project was never fully realized, however, as protestors in the mid-late 1990s objected to Queen Catherine's ties to the Transatlantic Slave Trade. (Others objected to the statue of a monarch overlooking a Revolutionary War battleground.) Flack nevertheless remained dedicated to the project, and notes that she endeavored to depict Catherine as biracial, reflecting her Portuguese background and paying homage to the ethnic diversity of the borough of Queens. Several preliminary models of the statue are now in public collections, including the Butler Institute of American Art and the Allen Memorial Art Museum.

(Appa) Pendse, the founder of Jnana Prabodhini Jnana Prabodhini was founded by psychologist, educator and social organizer Shri V. V. Pendse, who was inspired by Swami Vivekananda to create an organization that would change the nation through \\"man-making education\\". This is an extension of the Hindu concept of \\"Dharm-Sansthapana\\" ‚Äì a belief in cycles of societal resurgence and reconstruction propelled by ancient heroes and saints. This belief was advocated by Samarth Ramdas in the 17th century, and by Maharshi Dayanand, Swami Vivekananda, and Yogi Arvinda. Having studied leadership styles, Pendse believed that a congenial atmosphere for education would inspire even- mindedness, and that intelligence was present among all social castes. The organization sought to identify intelligence at an impressionable age, and initially conducted enrichment programs at the high school level. According to the organization's website, its vision is to transform society through education with a core of spirituality, enabling leaders to emerge who will be motivated to serve society with compassion. It also seeks to create an organization of selfless workers across all walks of life. Its primary area of activity is leadership development, which has been carried out in the sectors of education, research, health, rural development, women's empowerment (Hindi: Stree Shakti Prabodhan), national integration, and youth organization.  Facilities  Jnana Prabodhini is headquartered in Pune, Maharashtra, India, and is most active in that state. It operates centres at Nigdi, Solapur and Harali, and has about ten smaller facilities in the state. The organization has informal work groups in most districts of Maharashtra, and also has a presence in the neighbouring states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnatak, and also in Arunachal Pradesh and in Jammu and Kashmir. =Main centers= The Nigdi Center (Navnagar Vidyalaya) is located in the Pimpri- Chinchwad industrial area.

DAMA systems assign communication channels based on news issued from user terminals to a network security system. When the circuit is no longer in use, the channels are again returned to the central pool for reassignment to other users. Channels are typically a pair of carrier frequencies (one for transmit and one for receive), but can be other fixed bandwidth resources such as timeslots in a TDMA burst plan or even physical party line channels. Once a channel is allocated to a given pair of nodes, it is not available to other users in the network until their session is finished. It allows utilizing of one channel (radio or baseband frequency, timeslot, etc.) by many users sequentially at different times. This technology is mainly useful with sparsely used networks of transient clients, as opposed to PAMA (Permanently Assigned Multiple Access). By using DAMA technology the number of separate nodes that can use a limited pool of circuits can be greatly increased at the expense of no longer being able to provide simultaneous access for all possible pairs of nodes. A five-channel DAMA network can only have five simultaneous conversations but could have any number of nodes. A five-channel PAMA network permanently supports five simultaneous conversations, with channel ownership remaining with their permanently assigned nodes even when idle. DAMA and PAMA are related only to channel/resource allocation and should not be confused with the Multiple access/multiplexing methods (such as FDMA frequencies, TDMA slots, CDMA codes, or others) intended to divide a single communication channel into multiple virtual channels. These systems typically use resource allocation protocols that allow a more rapid (although often less deterministic, consider CDMA collisions) near-real-time allocation of bandwidth based on demand and data priority. However, in sparsely allocated multiple-access channels, DAMA can be used to allocate the individual virtual channel resources provided by the multiple-access channel. This is most common in environments that are sufficiently sparsely utilized that there is no need to add complexity just to recover \\"conversation gap\\" idle periods. DAMA is widely used in satellite communications, especially in VSAT systems. It is very effective in environments comprising multiple users each having a low to moderate usage profile. DAMA is often used in military environments due to the relative simplicity of implementation, ease of modeling, and the fact that military usage profiles are a very good fit. In military SATCOM, it has the added advantage that it can function in a bent pipe environment, thus requires no special security or coordination hardware on the satellite. This allows the master and slave ground stations to be upgraded repeatedly to change or improve security and compression without requiring an expensive satellite replacement.

It was initially developed by Remington Vernam, whose signature \\"R. Vernam\\" inspired the name of the neighborhood. Arverne extends from Beach 56th Street to Beach 79th Street, along its main thoroughfare Beach Channel Drive, alternatively known as Rev. Joseph H. May Drive. Arverne is located in Queens Community District 14 and its ZIP Code is 11692. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 100th Precinct. History = Original settlement = Overhead view of Arverne Vernam's original plan was to name the neighborhood Arverne-by-the-Sea. One grandiose plan, influenced by his wife Florence, included a canal running through the neighborhood, reminiscent of the Amstel canal in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. When this plan fell through, the canal right-of-way was converted into a thoroughfare, Amstel Boulevard, which, except for a stub west of Beach 71st Street, was later incorporated into Beach Channel Drive. Located on the Rockaway Boardwalk, Arverne became well-known as a beachfront community with inexpensive summer bungalows, and hotels of varying levels of expense and luxury as well as amusements and boardwalk concessions. It also attracted year-round residents. On January 3, 1914, a storm devastated the peninsula's neighborhoods and swept the 1,200-seat Arverne Pier Theater out to sea.The Wave of Long Island, January 10, 1914, p. 1 On June 15, 1922, a fire leveled a large part of Arverne, leaving about 10,000 people homeless, although the neighborhood was quick to rebuild. In 1928, a project to build 5,000 bungalows in Arverne was announced. = Decline = During the 1950s and 1960s, the advent of commercial jet air travel encouraged people to travel to distant destinations during the summer, rather than to local beaches and resorts. As a result, many of Arverne's summer bungalows became vacant. New York City's urban renewal projects of the 1960s leveled most of the summer resorts and some of the residences, many of which had been abandoned. In 1964, the New York City Planning Commission approved the designation of a Arverne renewal area. Two years later, the renewal area was expanded by 19 blocks. In expectation of the upcoming urban renewal, vacant bungalows were demolished. However, the renewal project was delayed, and a grand jury was convened to find the causes of the delay. A gap in funding from the U.S. federal government contributed to pressures to cancel the redevelopment. In 1970, the city announced it would develop 970 apartments in Arverne by 1972. By then, only about 100 of the original 900 bungalows remained. Controversy later arose when the city decided to place 100 mobile homes instead of permanent housing for low-income Puerto Ricans. By 1973, Mayor John Lindsay was calling for 500 of 3,650 proposed housing units to be deleted from the Arverne redevelopment plan. As of yet, the 970 apartments in Arverne had not been developed. When the city re-opened Arverne to redevelopment in 1984, a patch of Arverne only contained one structure: PS 106. In 1988, the administration of mayor Ed Koch started asking private developers to build on the site. The Dubos Point Wildlife Sanctuary was designated that year as part of the plans for redevelopment. By 1991, the plans called for the construction of 7,500 apartments over 10 years at a cost of $1.5 billion. Finally, the late 1990s saw construction begin on a 322-unit development of two-family houses, the first such development in the 35-year-old Arverne renewal area. The rest of the area's redevelopment was canceled after an economic downturn in the 1990s. People started dumping garbage in Dubos Point, to the consternation of residents. In 2003, The New York Times wrote: = Redevelopment = In the early 2000s, Mayor Michael Bloomberg started to revitalize Arverne with new housing and parks.

The governmental services in the area mainly cover children's issues and mental health issues. In the 1960s, the Ontario government was concerned about the rapid growth of Toronto. Townsend was conceived by the Government of Ontario to have a population of more than 100,000 people by the year 2000. However, workers moving into the area that became employed at the newly constructed Stelco, Texaco, and Ontario Hydro plants to the south mainly elected to locate to more established communities with commercial centres like Jarvis and Simcoe. A nursing home was built during the glory days of Townsend in addition to a recreational centre, a church, and a water tower.

Had the idea succeeded, Townsend would have been Southwestern Ontario's first \\"green\\" city with mass transit, urban-style parks, and a downtown area that combined commercial zones with residential areas. The area farms would have either remained in business or would have become golf courses as the economy improved over time. The parks would have appeared along the riverside.

It is located on Barry Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. At the time of its foundation in 1951, it was the first human settlement south of the Antarctic Circle. it is Argentina's westernmost permanent base. San Mart√≠n is one of 13 research bases in Antarctica operated by Argentina. History The increased Antarctic activity that Argentina developed since 1940, along with the longstanding national interest to exercise effective sovereignty over one of the most remote areas of Antarctica created the need for a scientific station located south of the Antarctic Circle. In order to transport the personnel and materials to Marguerite Bay, where the new settlement was to be built, the Argentine Navy hired the Santa Micaela. Commanded by Overseas Captain Santiago Farrell, it was a cargo ship belonging to the Argentine shipping company P√©rez Companc S. A.. The Santa Micaela left the port of Buenos Aires on 12 February 1951, and on 8 March it anchored at Marguerite Bay. The last part of the trip it was escorted by the Argentine Navy tug ARA Sanavir√≥n. Over twelve working days the crew built the two-story main house with double wooden walls, a main deposit, an emergency house, five metal warehouses for supplies, housing for the dog packs, a power generator and the four towers for the high rhombic antenna. San Mart√≠n was inaugurated on 21 March 1951, in the presence of the Santa Micaela and ARA Sanavir√≥n crews and the base personnel led by then Colonel Hern√°n Pujato. Since then, the meteorological station within the base provides detailed weather records and develops forecasts indispensable for the navigation of the sea waters adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula. On March 1952 the ARA Bah√≠a Aguirre anchored at Marguerite Bay bringing a relief crew through a Sikorsky S-51 helicopter transfer, the first of its kind performed by the Argentine Armed Forces in Antarctica. On 30 June 1952 a fire, exacerbated by the ongoing blizzard, devoured the main house and two food stores, the power plant and the radio station. With rationed food and fuel, activities continued normally, carrying on with the explorations schedule as originally planned. During the 1952‚Äì53 season, thick ice blocked the way of relief ships, which aggravated the situation for the twenty base inhabitants. On 26 March 1953 the Argentine Air Force Avro Lincoln nicknamed Cruz del Sur airdropped food and other priceless items. Personnel at San Mart√≠n Base conducted several exploration expeditions to the northern and southern boundaries of the bay. They also crossed the Antarctic Peninsula mountain range, reaching the Mobiloil Inlet on the Weddell Sea. In 1960 the base was closed; it was reactivated as permanent on 21 March 1976. On 14 June 1962 an expedition led by then First Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Gir√≥ Tapper left Esperanza looking for a passage that would link the village with San Mart√≠n. Using snowcats and sleigh dogs they explored Duse Bay, Prince Gustav Channel, Cape Longing, Foca Nunataks, Ameghino Peninsula, Jason Island, Cape Robinson and Carreta Bay, where they had to leave the snow cats and continue with sleds to cross the cordillera. After reaching San Mart√≠n, they traveled back to Esperanza, where they arrived on 25 August. During the trip the party overcame numerous obstacles and withstood temperatures below and katabatic winds of . This feat is considered even now as the most important ever made in the area. =Historic site= Some unused installations of the base, a cross, a flagpole and a monolith erected in 1951, have been designated as Historic Site or Monument, following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Description Marguerite Bay opens on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Wide and deep, the bay is closed between Belgrano and Alexander I islands, and the Fallieres Coast, making its access very difficult for most of the year due to the thick ice-covered waters. In this zone, rarely visited because of the difficulties and hazards for navigation, there are several groups of islands, islets, rocks and reefs that draw a network of channels and fjords, usually frozen. Some of the most important islands are the Pourquoi Pas, Herradura, Caballete and Millerand, all of them next to the Debenham archipelago, where San Mart√≠n was built. San Mart√≠n is composed of 14 buildings spanning a total area of . The base has several dependencies and facilities, namely: main house; airstrip; heliport; infirmary; chapel; main and auxiliary power plants; vehicle fleet (a number of ski-doos, and a few snow tracks and ATVs) and park, laboratory, mechanical and carpentry workshops, and several deposits. The all-year capable airstrip is located on nearby Uspallata Glacier; during winter the deeply frozen sea is also used to land light aircraft. The infirmary and basic operating suite is attended by a doctor and a nurse; it has one bed, x-ray and odontological facilities.

Ona Refuge Refuge Ona () is an Argentine Antarctic refuge installed and operated by the government of the Tierra del Fuego Province. The refuge was opened in 1995 and it is located from the San Mart√≠n Base on the glaciers of the Falli√®res Coast. The construction of the refuge was part of the scientific project, called Perito Moreno, carried out under an agreement signed between the Instituto Ant√°rtico Argentino and the University of Freiburg in Germany. The researchers carry out studies on the displacement of glaciers and the dynamics of the snow layers. The shelter has a capacity for four people, food for 15 days, fuel, gas and first aid kit.  Climate  The San Mart√≠n base has a polar climate that is moderated by its coastline position, hence having a mean for the mildest month. The most significant feature in the area's climate is the violent wind, with speeds well in excess of , which significantly increases the chill factor; such strong winds often blow for five or six days in a row, making it impossible to stay outdoors and turning any simple external work into a very dangerous task. The temperature is variable: on average it reaches in winter and in summer. The sea freezes between the months of June to November, its average thickness being about . The average annual snowfall is ; some rains have been recorded in recent years.

This identity was suggested by researcher Alice Margerum, who said that in the period of the painting, \\"citole-related names\\" were little used in Italy, but cetra or cetera was. She said she believes that this particular era of the instrument is the instrument referred to by Dante in De vulgari eloquentia . Cetra, a Latin word borrowed from Greek, is an Italian descendant of Œ∫ŒπŒ∏Œ¨œÅŒ± (cithara). It is a synonym for the cittern but has been used for the citole and cithara (the lyre-form) and cythara (the lyre-form developing into a necked instrument). The cithara was a stringed musical instrument, constructed in wood and similar to the lyre, with a larger harmonic case. It was widely used in ancient times. The instrument spread from ancient Greece, where it was played by professional citaredi, to Rome and Corsica. While originally a word for a lyre in Greece, eventually the word was applied to a necked-instrument. The name cetra was seen by musicologist and historian Laurence Wright as being synonymous with the citole, and in his entry in the New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments he said that cetera and cetra were Italian language words for the citole. The cetra used this way was a plucked instrument, related to the fiddle and used c. 1200-1350. In the Renaissance, the term 'cetra' came to signify a pear- shaped instrument with a flat sound-board and a long neck, whose pairs of metal strings were plucked. The Italian citole, known there as cetra, eventually became the cittern. Use of the word in musical works The name La Cetra was also used by a number of composers to entitle sets of their works. These composers included Legrenzi, Marcello and Vivaldi. *Giovanni Legrenzi (1626‚Äì1690), a prominent composer in Venice in the late 17th century, was the first to use the name La Cetra, for a collection of 18 sonatas published in Venice in 1673.Legrenzi's La Cetra was published as Op. 10, though it was in fact Legrenzi‚Äôs 11th volume. It appears that his Venetian publisher, who had published his Op. 9 mass and psalms in 1667 some years before, was unaware of his Op. 10 solo motets published in Bologna in 1670. A manuscript copy dating from 1680 corrects the numbering, though a second edition, printed again in Venice in 1682, preserves the original numbering. See Stephen Bonta (ed), La Cetra. Sonate a due tre e quattro stromenti, libro quattro, opus 10, 1673, Department of Music, Harvard University, 1992, p. xv. La Cetra was an early example of a collection of sonatas published in sets of six (in this case, three sets of six) which was to become a standard practice. As with the remainder of Legrenzi‚Äôs considerable output of sonatas ‚Äì La Cetra was his fourth volume ‚Äì the majority are for stringed instruments with organ continuo. There are, however, two curious sonatas in La Cetra set for a quartet of viols which can furthermore be played a minor third lower by simply changing the clefs.Quite why Legrenzi chose to write for viols at this late date is unclear, though he did, at the time, have an association with the Mendicanti in Venice, which owned a number of viols; while the dedication is to the Emperor Leopold I, whose court also had viols at this time and indeed as late as the turn of the 18th century. See, for example, Peter Allsop, Cavalier Giovanni Battista Buonamente: Franciscan Violinist, Ashgate, 2005, pp. 61, 121. La Cetra is in a number of respects more modern than many of its predecessors (including Legrenzi‚Äôs own collections). It is, for example, mainly scored for the violins and violas that were replacing viols as the main stringed instrument, while the music itself reflects an increasing interest in tonality whereas previously the modal system had played a significant role in determining the ordering of sonatas. La Cetra was to become the most highly esteemed of Legrenzi‚Äôs works, and the impact of the sonatas carried his name into the history of European music. *Alessandro Marcello (1669‚Äì1747), who lived and worked somewhat later in Venice, published a set of 6 concerti he had written under the title of La Cetra. These concerti are \\"unusual for their wind solo parts, concision and use of counterpoint within a broadly Vivaldian style,\\" according to Grove. *Antonio Vivaldi (1678‚Äì1741), the Red Priest of Venice, used the name La cetra for two different sets of his works. **The first set that he called La cetra consisted of 12 concertos, Op. 9, his last great set of printed violin concerti. He dedicated them to the music-loving Habsburg monarch, the Emperor Charles VI in 1727. **The following year, 1728, Vivaldi wrote another set of 12 concerti that he again, for unknown reasons, named La cetra. He dedicated this new set of concerti again to Charles VI and gave him the manuscript of the concerti. The concerti were never published. They have been offered in reconstructed form by Andrew Manze and The English Consort as Concertos for the Emperor. In Monteverdi's opera L'Orfeo (1607, libretto by Alessandro Striggio) Orpheus refers to his instrument as a Cetra (e.g. in the aria \\"\\", act 4).

Early life and education Thomas was born in Holt and grew up in Russellville, Alabama. His father, Ralph Cage Thomas, was the town's superintendent of education; his mother, Chamintney Stovall Thomas, was a music teacher. Thomas credits his parents, along with his brother, two sisters and his extended family, for his strong sense of character. He was educated at Harvard University where he earned bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in biological sciences with a concentration in botany. Academic career He served as a professor of biology at The University of Alabama from 1961 until his subsequent appointment as assistant dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, followed by his appointment as vice president for student affairs in 1969. Thomas took the position of chancellor at North Carolina State University in 1976; he was the school's ninth chief executive. While in office, enrollment at the university grew by 25 percent and surpassed 20,000 for the first time. He oversaw the establishment of the School of Veterinary Medicine, the Center for Economic and Business Studies, the North Carolina Japan Center, and the Caldwell Fellows scholarship program. Thomas resigned as chancellor in 1981. A partial manuscript collection related to Joab Langston Thomas is housed in the NCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center in D.H. Hill Library. In addition, Thomas Hall was named in his honor in 2009. In 1981 Thomas returned to The University of Alabama to serve as the school's president, an office he held until 1988. During his presidency, the university tripled research funding, raised admission standards, established a core curriculum and a University-wide honors program, and initiated the Presidential Scholars program to recruit top students. He also helped develop the UA Arboretum and served as its second director. A notable hire of his presidency at Alabama was that of Ray Perkins to succeed Bear Bryant as the school's football coach in December 1982. Thomas later hired Bill Curry to succeed Perkins in 1987 when Perkins left to become coach of the National Football League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He served as president of Pennsylvania State University from 1990-1995, where he oversaw the largest building program in the university's history and oversaw Penn State's entry into the Big 10 athletic conference.

Side A from an Attic red-figure amphora, c. 490‚Äì480 BCE. Found in Vulci, Italy. The Berlin Painter (active c. 490‚Äì460s BCE) is the conventional name given to an Attic Greek vase-painter who is widely regarded as a rival to the Kleophrades Painter, among the most talented vase painters of the early 5th century BCE (see Pottery of Ancient Greece). The Berlin Painter along with the Kleophrades Painter was educated by a member of the Pioneer Group, who introduced red- figure painting. Name vase The Berlin Painter was named by Sir John Beazley for a large lidded amphora in the Antikensammlung Berlin (the Berlin Painter's name vase).Perseus Project. Berlin F 2160. Side A: satyr and Hermes. Hermes strides to the right swinging his arms. He holds a large kantharos and a kerykeion (herald's wand) in his forward hand, and a small oinochoe in his hand which he swings behind him. He is dressed in a short tunic and chlamys, and wears a winged cap and winged boots. A satyr stands in front of him facing right, his head turned to the left. He is holding a barbiton (lyre) in one arm, his fingers splayed across the strings. In his other hand, held out behind him, he holds the end of a string attached to the lyre. He has a long beard and wears a wreath, and his right leg is shown in three-quarters view. A fawn stands between the two figures, its head gracefully turned up. The figures are carefully superimposed on one another, forming a unified contour isolated against the black background of the vase. Side B: Satyr. A satyr stands to the right, holding a large kantharos and a lyre. The kantharos is raised to his lips, while he holds the lyre at his side, his fingers touching the stings. His long hair is tied at his neck and he wears a wreath. Above the scene is a carefully drawn band of ivy leaves and grape bunches; below, forming a groundline but not extending all the way around the vase, is a running spiral, a rare pattern ornament in Attic Red Figure vase paintings. Kithara player, c. 490 BCThe vase is in good condition. Side A is well preserved, but side B has suffered surface wear and discoloration. Forms and repertoire There are no painter signatures on any of the Berlin Painter's attributed works. The Berlin Painter began working in the Late Archaic style and helped develop the Classic style of Attic red-figure pottery. Over a long career he trained many younger vase-painters, including, probably, the Achilles Painter. Neck amphora depicting an athlete running the hoplitodromos by the Berlin Painter, c. 480 BCE, Louvre He produced a series of Panathenaic amphora, which are his only black-figure vases.See Alan Shapiro, in Padgett. (The Panathenaic amphora featured a depiction of the event for which it was the prize, and on the opposite side Athena. The Athena on his Panathenaic amphora was always depicted with a gorgoneion on her shield.) Although it appears that the Panathenaic shape is his favorite, the Berlin Painter utilized a variety of different shapes. He painted a number of Nolan Amphora, and was responsible for the popularity of that form.[Beazley, Sir. John. \\"The Berlin Painter\\" London: Cambridge University Press, 1964]; Jasper Gaunt, in Padgett. On his other vases, painted red figures are usually isolated or paired without framing devices against a glossy black ground, so integral to the forms of their superbly-made bodies that the wares themselves are thought also to have been produced in his shop. The tall figures often start near the middle of the vase and continue over the shoulder, stopping at the neck. He pays close attention to the drapery of their clothing, and their facial features. Most notable is the eye, which is typically open, long, and with the pupil towards the inner eye. He is also known for his careful stopt key patterns, which border the bottom of his single figures, and are unique to the Berlin painter and his students. The pattern features alternating meander boxes with alternating saltire squares. The Berlin Painter used dilute glaze to add red tones onto his vases. This is clear on the fawn's coat in his namepiece. Fawns and Greek animals are popular themes in his work, which varied from mythological themes to athletes. His two most popular characters from mythology are Athena and Apollo. From the surviving vases, it is safe to assume that he was a major painter, there are over 400 vases and fragments attributed to him. The majority of his works have been found across Italy. This may suggest that they were created for export to the Italian market.See David Saunders, in Padgett. Many of his valued works were preserved as √©lite grave goods in the necropoleis of Magna Graecia and Etruria, notably at Vulci, Nola and Locri.

His contact there is Furio Giunta, a local mobster who speaks English. Tony learns that Don Vittorio, boss of the Naples family, is senile. His son-in-law, Mauro Zucca, had been in charge but is now serving life in prison. It is hard for Tony to accept that Annalisa ‚Äì Vittorio's daughter and Mauro's wife ‚Äì is the de facto head of the family. Tony negotiates with Annalisa, naming his price for the cars, asking that Furio be sent to work for him in the United States, and asking that others be sent in the future as he requires. Annalisa scoffs at his proposition. Later, Annalisa comes on to him but he tells her he wishes to keep their relationship professional. Tony then lowers his price for the cars in exchange for Furio and any subsequent men; she agrees. Meanwhile, Paulie tries to rediscover his roots only to uncover a distaste for Italy, while Christopher is high on heroin almost all the time. Carmela is resentful that Tony has not taken her to Italy. She has lunch with Rosalie Aprile and Angie Bonpensiero, where Angie shares how unhappy she is that Pussy has returned. He is indifferent to her even though she is awaiting the result of a biopsy. She says she has thought of suicide and that she intends to divorce him. Carmela later visits her and urges her not to break the sacrament of marriage. While with his FBI handler, Skip Lipari, Pussy runs into Jimmy Bones, a Soprano associate. They concoct a cover story, but Pussy is afraid that Jimmy does not believe it. He goes to Jimmy's home and beats him to death with a ball-peen hammer. Pussy then goes home with a bunch of flowers. When Angie told him earlier that her tumor was benign, he brushed it off. He gives her the flowers, but after a short pause, she beats him with them. Tony returns home. Carmela is upstairs, doing housework. He calls her. She pauses before she goes to greet him.

Lady Jane married first John Holt (d.1728), a nephew of Sir John Holt. She married secondly in 1733 Robert Coke, of the family of Sir Edward Coke, and Vice- Chamberlain to Queen Caroline. She died without issue from either marriage. On the death of her brother Philip in 1731, the family peerages, including Marquess and Duke of Wharton, became extinct. After the death of her sister Lady Lucy Morice, Lady Jane was the only surviving heir of the 1st Marquess of Wharton, until her death without issue. Wharton barony revived In 1844, the extinct title Baron Wharton was claimed by Colonel Charles Kemeys-Tynte, formerly a Member of Parliament from 1820 to 1837. The documents that had created that peerage in 1544 had been lost, so the House of Lords's Committee for Privileges ruled (erroneously) that the barony had been created by writ, meaning that it would descend to heirs general. By this application of the succession, it was ruled that Lady Jane Coke had been Baroness Wharton in her own right, from her sister's death in 1739 to her own death. Colonel Kemeys- Tynte's claim came from his descent from Lady Jane's grandfather the 4th Baron, as after Jane's death the succession would be divided among his daughters' descendants, including Kemeys-Tynte. The House of Lords did not act upon the barony (which it now considered to be in abeyance) due to the Duke of Wharton's status as an outlaw, but in 1916 Colonel Kemeys-Tynte's great-great- grandson, also named Charles Kemeys-Tynte, succeeded in having the title called out of abeyance in his favour. Because the Duke of Wharton was the 6th Baron Wharton and Lady Jane Coke was considered to have held the barony after him, the new Lord Wharton was counted as the 8th Baron. As the succession of the title between 1731 and 1916 is based on different rules than the (lost) ones actually implemented in 1544, he may more properly considered the 1st Baron of a new creation given the precedence of 1544, but the so-called 7th Baroness is the only intervening person considered to have held the title at all.

He has been listed as the 25th richest person in British football. He founded Stadia Catering in the 1960s and Signal Radio in 1983. Early life Peter Coates was born in Goldenhill, Stoke-on-Trent, the youngest of 14 children. He was brought up by his sister, Irene, after his mother died when he was two. His father, Leonard was a miner and World War I veteran who had a keen interest in football, where they regularly attended Stoke City's Victoria Ground. Coates signed for the club on amateur terms in the 1950s, but admitted he was \\"not quite good enough\\" to make it as a professional, instead he went on to play for local non-league sides Goldenhill Wanderers and Kidsgrove Athletic, he stopped playing football at the age of 23. Early business dealings Coates left school at age fourteen to work in an office to help his family make ends meet. This lasted until he was old enough to join the Parachute Regiment for his National Service. After leaving the army he took a job with the Wimpy restaurant chain, eventually rising to the position of regional manager. Using his restaurant background as a springboard, Coates founded Stadia Catering. Their specialty was catering events at football grounds, and they would eventually merge with competitor Lindley Catering. He used the increase in revenue to purchase a chain of betting shops that he dubbed Provincial Racing. He also founded the local radio station Signal 1 in 1983. bet365 bet365 was founded in 2000 in a portakabin in Stoke-on-Trent by the Coates family, led by his daughter Denise. Denise Coates developed a sports betting platform and trading team to launch the business online in March 2001. The business borrowed ¬£15 million from RBS against the family's betting shop estate which had been started by Peter Coates in 1974. bet365 sold its betting shop chain in 2005 for ¬£40 million and paid off its loan to RBS. bet365 has grown into one of the world's largest online gambling companies with its reported figures to March 2010 showing amounts wagered on sports at ¬£5.4 billion, revenues of ¬£358 million, and an operating profit of ¬£104 million. Peter Coates holds the position of chairman of bet365. Denise Coates, joint chief executive, continues to run bet365 with her brother, John. Chairman of Stoke City =First period (1986‚Äì1998)= In 1986, Peter Coates became majority shareholder at Stoke City and was appointed chairman in September 1986 taking over from Sandy Clubb. The club had been through a tough period with poor finances and a humiliating relegation in 1984‚Äì85. Coates backed Mick Mills in 1986‚Äì87 for a promotion push but they fell short and Mills had to sell players before making additions. In preparation for the 1989‚Äì90 season Stoke spent a combined ¬£1million on new players with a then club record of ¬£480,000 for Ian Cranson. However results were appalling and the team finished bottom of the table and fell into the third tier. In 1990 the Stoke City board consisted of six directors and it was agreed that a new share issue was needed, with the majority wanting the supporters to be free to purchase. Following disagreements regarding this share issue, several board members left and the board then consisted of Peter Coates, Keith Humphreys and David Edwards. Coates appointed Lou Macari for the 1991‚Äì92 season and he guided the club to the Second Division title and victory in the 1992 Associate Members' Cup Final. Supporters were dismayed with the board after Mark Stein was sold to Chelsea in October 1993 for ¬£1.4 million and shortly after Macari left to join Celtic. Macari returned to Stoke the following season and the side nearly gained promotion in 1995‚Äì96 losing to Leicester City in the play-offs. The board decided to move to a new all-seater-stadium following the 1996‚Äì97 season after deciding it would be too costly to upgrade the Victoria Ground to meet the Taylor Report. The first season at the new Britannia Stadium was a disaster for the club as unexpectedly Macari left and was replaced by his assistant Chic Bates. Coates was coming in for a lot of criticism from supporters for his lack of spending and after a embarrassing 7‚Äì0 defeat at home to Birmingham City on 10 January 1998 around 2,000 angry supporters invaded the pitch at full-time and some attempted to enter the directors box. After more fan protests Coates resigned as chairman although he remained a majority shareholder, whilst Keith Humphreys was appointed chairman as Stoke were relegated to the Second Division. In 1999, a group of Icelandic businessmen formed a consortium to buy the club led by Gunnar G√≠slason. The consortium Stoke Holding paid around ¬£3.5 million. The deal was completed on 15 November 1999. The Icelandic consortium eventually took Stoke back the First Division via the play-offs in 2002 and consolidated the club in mid- table but were unable to mount a promotion attempt. The consortium made one last effort to gain promotion in the 2005‚Äì06 season after sacking Tony Pulis and replacing him with Johan Boskamp. He brought in a large number of foreign players and ultimately only managed a mid-table finish and the owners left at the end of the season. =Second period (2006‚Äìpresent)= The Coates family through a bet365 subsidiary company completed the purchase of Stoke City F.C. for ¬£1.7 million. Coates later stated the Icelandic consortium had left the club in a \\"mess\\" with debts of around ¬£9 million. Coates re-appointed Tony Pulis as manager ahead of the 2006‚Äì07 season and the team almost made it to the play-offs. They did achieve promotion to the Premier League in 2007‚Äì08 finishing in 2nd place. Stoke secured survival in 2008‚Äì09 despite being favorites for relegation. Stoke broke their transfer record in August 2010, paying Sunderland ¬£8 million for Kenwyne Jones. Stoke reached their first FA Cup Final in 2010‚Äì11, losing 1‚Äì0 to Manchester City. Stoke again broke their transfer record in 2011‚Äì12 spending ¬£10 million on Peter Crouch. Supporters began to get frustrated with the style of football played under Pulis in 2012‚Äì13 and so Coates replaced him with Mark Hughes. The style of football improved under Hughes and Stoke enjoyed a good period finishing ninth three seasons running in 2013‚Äì14, 2014‚Äì15 and 2015‚Äì16. Problems began to emerge through as Hughes began to move on the longer serving players and replace them with his own with ¬£18 million spent on Giannelli Imbula in February 2015 and Kevin Wimmer in August 2017 with both making little impact of the team. Coates came in for criticism from supporters in December 2017 with the team in deep relegation trouble and pressure mounting on Hughes, He dismissed the fans concerns with‚Äî \\"I don‚Äôt know what all the fuss is about\\". He sacked Hughes soon after and replaced him with Paul Lambert who was unable to keep Stoke in the Premier League. Gary Rowett was appointed manager going into the 2018‚Äì19 season and despite spending over ¬£30 million on new players he was unable to mount a promotion bid and was sacked in January 2019 and replaced with Nathan Jones. Jones turned out to a poor choice as Stoke made a awful start to the 2019‚Äì20 season and were cut adrift at the bottom of the table by November. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill was brought in and he was able to guide Stoke to Championship survival. In September 2020 his son John Coates was appointed as joint-chairman. Political activity Coates has been a significant Labour Party donor, although he did not donate to the party while Jeremy Corbyn was leader. During the 2020 Labour leadership election, he donated ¬£25,000 to Keir Starmer's successful campaign. Personal life Coates' father, Leonard was a miner and fought in World War I with the York and Lancaster Regiment where he was awarded a Military Medal. In December 2014 it was announced that Leonard would have a street named after him in Stoke-on- Trent. Coates was awarded honorary degrees from Staffordshire University in 2008, and Keele University in 2011. Speaking at the Football Governance Inquiry in March 2011, he said: \\"I am a Stoke boy, I have supported the club since I was a boy and I have had two comings at Stoke ‚Äì an early one in 1985, after which I sold the club to an Icelandic consortium and then bought it back again about five years ago this summer. I bought it back again against my better judgment, in some ways, and my family's, who all thought I was daft to do it. The club was in a mess at the time and I thought I could help it and do things for it, and I was a bit disappointed with my previous time, and there was a little bit of unfinished business about it and all that sort of thing. But I thought it would be important for the area if the football club were doing well. Stoke was having a difficult time. It has lost the pot banks and the mining industry. I thought that if Stoke could get in the Premier League it would give the place a lift and would be good for it. I think that that has happened, I am pleased to say.\\" References Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Bookmakers Peter Category:English football chairmen and investors Category:English footballers Category:Kidsgrove Athletic F.C. players Category:Labour Party (UK) donors Category:People from Goldenhill Category:Stoke City F.C. directors and chairmen ","title":"Peter Coates"},{"id":"4843607","text":"Hornblower and the Atropos is a 1953 historical novel by C.S. Forester. Horatio Hornblower is posted to HMS Atropos, the smallest vessel in the Royal Navy that merits command by a post-captain, as he salvages treasure from the Mediterranean Sea. Plot summary On a December day in 1805, Hornblower travels with his very pregnant wife and their son to London on a canal boat via the Thames and Severn Canal and the Thames. He is excited about getting his new orders and obtaining his first command as a post-captain. On the canal, the assistant boatman becomes incapacitated through drink, thus allowing Hornblower the opportunity to learn much of canal boat operation when he volunteers to take the man's place at the boat's helm. Upon their arrival in London, Hornblower assumes command of the Atropos. His first assignment is a unique one: to organise Admiral Horatio Nelson's funeral. The Battle of Trafalgar had just taken place, in which Nelson was shot and killed by a musket. The whole nation is in deep mourning and all eyes are on the funeral. The funeral consists of a procession on the Thames between Greenwich Pier and Whitehall Steps, during which the ceremonial barge conveying Nelson's coffin springs a leak. The crew, after frantic bailing, barely manage to unload the coffin without disrupting the proceedings noticeably. Once Hornblower finishes with the funeral, he is presented to the King at Court. He is informed that the King's nephew, a German prince driven out of his principality by Napoleon, is to be one of his midshipmen on the Atropos. Hornblower's treatment of the prince is a continuing subplot. Hornblower is then sent to collect from Gibraltar three Sinhalese pearl divers and their quarrelsome salvage master to recover treasure from a sunken British ship, the Speedwell, which went down in Marmorice Bay in Turkey carrying a fortune in silver and gold ‚Äì the pay chests of the British Army in Egypt. Hornblower is given the salvage operation. The Turks are already aware of the presence of the gold, and in the weeks Atropos is present in Marmorice become aware of the supposedly secret recovery operation. They bring a Turkish warship into the bay, and man a previously deserted fort, trapping Atropos. When the Turks demand all the money Hornblower has so far recovered, he puts them off until the following morning. In the middle of the night, he makes a daring escape by an extremely perilous route, avoiding both ship and fort, and outsmarting the Turks. Following Hornblower's delivery of the treasure at Gibraltar, he helps capture a Spanish ship, the Castilla, and makes his way into a Sicilian port for repairs. He does such a fine job that his ship attracts the notice of the King of The Two Sicilies. The British government transfers the vessel to the Sicilian navy in return for the King's allegiance. Hornblower makes his way back to England, only to find both of his children mortally ill with smallpox.  Inconsistencies  Other books in the series refer to Hornblower capturing the Castilla as a lieutenant, but he is a captain in this book, which actually describes the battle. Confusingly, the obscure short story \\"The Hand of Destiny\\" (1940) also describes an entirely different action featuring Lieutenant Hornblower capturing the Castilla. Forester, apparently, would retcon Hornblower's history, overwriting the events of his short stories in subsequent novel-length works. \\"The fact that he discouraged the re- publication of the short stories is an indicator that he gave the novels' events preference. Also, in this book it is mentioned that Hornblower is presented to King George III for the first time. However, In \\"Flying Colours\\" Hornblower mentioned to Frere that he was presented at court in \\" '98'\\" 1798 should be somewhere in between being prisoner at Ferrol and sailing with \\"Renown\\" to the Caribbean, (see \\"Lieutenant Hornblower\\".

It is often a matter of dispute whether a certain government is to be characterized as fascist (radical authoritarian nationalism), authoritarian, totalitarian, or a police state. The term \\"fascism\\" itself is controversial, and has been defined in various ways by different authors. Many of the regimes and movements discussed in this article can be considered fascist according to some definitions but not according to others. See definitions of fascism for more information on that subject. The Axis (1940‚Äì1945) =Italy (1922‚Äì1943)= The first fascist country, Italy, was ruled by Benito Mussolini (Il Duce) until he was dismissed and arrested on 25 July 1943. Mussolini was then rescued from prison by Germany, and was made the head of a state of \\"Repubblica di Sal√≤\\" in northern Italy, which continued to fight the allies alongside Germany.Richard J. B. Bosworth, Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915-1945 (2007). =Germany (1933‚Äì1945)= The National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazis) came to power in Germany as a minority party when its leader, Adolf Hitler, was named chancellor following the elections of 1933. Hitler moved swiftly to consolidate power, first through passage of the Enabling Act of 1933. After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, the entire power of the German state was concentrated in Hitler's hands. The German National socialists were known for their use of thuggery and intimidation of political opponents and dissenters, including outright persecution of the country's Jewish citizenry, resulting in the Holocaust. Nonetheless, they were widely popular among many segments of the German population, particularly the working class, for their perceived success in reversing the nation's economic decline.Ludwig von Mises ([1940], 1998). Interventionism: An Economic Analysis, trans. Thomas Francis McManus and Heinrich Bund, ed. Bettina Bien Greaves. Irvington-on-Hudson, NY: Foundation for Economic Education, Inc. p. 88-89 One of Hitler's cornerstone policies was known as Lebensraum, which served as the rationale for Germany's expansionist foreign policy and ultimately led to the Second World War. =Japan (1931‚Äì1945)= Right-wing elements in Japan, including industrialists, military officers, and the nobility, had long opposed democracy as an anathema to national unity. Military cliques began to dominate the national government starting in the 1930s. A major militarist nationalist movement in Japan from the 1920s to the 1930s was the Imperial Way Faction \\"Kodoha\\" of which future wartime Prime Minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç was a part. In 1936, Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, aimed at countering the Soviet Union and the Communist International. In 1940, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoye established the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, or Taisei Yokusankai, to consolidate all political parties under a single umbrella group. That same year, Japan joined Germany and Italy in the Tripartite Pact. Other countries =Austria (1933‚Äì1945)= Engelbert Dollfu√ü's idea of a \\"St√§ndestaat\\" was borrowed from Mussolini. Dollfu√ü dissolved parliament and established a clerical-fascist dictatorship which lasted until Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany through the Anschluss of 1938.Anton Pelinka, The Dollfuss/Schuschnigg Era in Austria: A Reassessment (Routledge, 2017). =Brazil (1932‚Äì1938)= Briefly, Vargas' regime was aligned with Pl√≠nio Salgado's Integralist Party, Brazil's fascist movement. Vargas launched a cult of personality that endures to this day, on top of the \\"Worker's Rights\\" (such as the rights to vacations and minimal wage) being extremely similar to Mussonili's own \\"Worker's Rights\\". Criticism on whether the government was fascist or not derives from the fact that Vargas followed the Castilhismo ideology, which is strongly Positivist, incompatible with Fascism's metaphysical, traditionalist, almost occultist ideas. Jo√£o F√°bio Bertonha, \\"Between sigma and fascio: an analysis of the relationship between Italian Fascism and Brazilian Integralism.\\" Luso-Brazilian Review (2000): 93-105. online =Chile (1932-1938)= In Chile, during the 1930s, there was a fascist party named National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNS), ruled by Jorge Gonz√°lez von Mar√©es, a Hitler sympathizer. However, the MNS was dissolved in 1938.Sandra McGee Deutsch, \\"Fascism, Neo-Fascism, or Post-Fascism? Chile, 1945-1988.\\" Di√°logos-Revista do Departamento de Hist√≥ria e do Programa de P√≥s- Gradua√ß√£o em Hist√≥ria 13.1 (2009). online =Republic of China (1941‚Äì1945)= The more left-wing though politically syncretic faction of the Kuomintang led by Wang Jingwei, split from the mainline right-wing faction of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, gradually embraced and espoused increasingly fascist oriented positions, including anti-communist doctrine. This eventually led to their recognition by members of the Axis Powers, including Germany and Italy, when Wang Jingwei's faction of the Kuomintang gained prominence and assumed control of a puppet regime based in Nanjing established in 1941 by forces of the invading Japanese military. =Croatia (1941‚Äì1945)= Poglavnik Ante Paveliƒá, leader of the infamous Usta≈°e movement, came to power in 1941 as the Croatian puppet leader under the control of Nazi Germany. Under the indirect control of Germany, the Usta≈°e regime was based heavily upon both upon clerical fascism and the Italian model of fascism, with elements of racial integrity and organic nationalism drawn from Nazism. =Finland (1929‚Äì1932)= The Lapua Movement, established in 1929, originally a nationalist movement that opposed Sweden and Russia, turned into a fascist movement in the early 1930s. However, the party's origins could date back to the early 1920s, in anti-communist forces during the Finnish Civil War. They attempted a coup d'√©tat in 1932, after which the movement was banned. The Lapua Movement, however, affected the selection of Pehr Evind Svinhufvud as the president and the passing of extensive anti-communist laws. Finland stayed a democracy throughout World War II, despite co-operating with Nazi Germany. =France (1940‚Äì1944)= The Vichy regime of Philippe P√©tain, established following France's defeat by Germany, collaborated with the Nazis. However, the minimal importance of fascists in the government until its direct occupation by Germany makes it appear to seem more similar to the regime of Franco or Salazar than the model fascist powers. While it has been argued that anti- Semitic raids performed by the Vichy regime were more in the interests of pleasing Germany than in service of ideology, anti-semitism was a full component of the \\"National Revolution\\" ideology of Vichy. As early as October 1940 the Vichy regime introduced the infamous statut des Juifs, that produced a new legal definition of Jewishness and which barred Jews from certain public offices. They interned Liberals, Communists, Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, in concentration camps as soon as 1940. Also, in May 1941 the Parisian police force had collaborated in the internment of foreign Jews. As a means of identifying Jews, the German authorities required all Jews in the occupied zone to wear a yellow badge. On the 11 June, they demanded that 100,000 Jews be handed over for deportation. The most infamous of these mass arrests was the so-called Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv) which took place in Paris on the 16 and 17 July 1942. The V√©lodrome d'Hiver was a large cycle track situated on the rue N√©laton near the Quai de Grenelle in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. In a vast operation codenamed \\"Spring Breeze\\" (Vent printanier), the French police rounded up 13,152 Jews from Paris and its surrounding suburbs. These were mostly adult men and women however approximately 4,000 children were among them. Identifications for the arrests were made easier by the large number of files on Jews complied and held by Vichy authorities since 1940. The French police, headed by Ren√© Bousquet, were entirely responsible for this operation and no German soldiers assisted. Pierre Laval, head of Vichy, included the children in the deportations to Auschwitz against general German orders. Most of the deportees sealed in the transports died en route due to lack of food or water. The few survivors were sent to the gas chambers. A few months later, a police operation took place in Marseille, known as the Battle of Marseille, and led to massive raids in the so-called \\"free zone\\", administrated by Vichy. =Greece (1936‚Äì1941)= Ioannis Metaxas' 1936 to 1941 dictatorship was partly fascist in its ideological nature, and might hence be characterized as quasi-fascist or authoritarian. It had a National Youth Organisation based on the Hitlerjugend, developed an armamentistic-centered economy, established a police-state akin to that of Nazi Germany (Greece received tactical and material support from Himmler, who exchanged correspondence with the Greek Minister of State Security Konstantinos Maniadakis) and brutality against communists in big cities such as Athens (communism was not known at small towns and villages of Greece yet). The Colonel George Papadopoulos' 1967 to 1974 military dictatorship, which was supported by the United States, however, was less ideological and lacked a clear fascist element other than militarism. =Hungary (1932‚Äì1945)= By 1932, support for right-wing ideology, embodied by Prime Minister Gyula G√∂mb√∂s, had reached the point where Hungarian Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy could not postpone appointing a fascist prime minister. Horthy also showed signs of admiring the efficiency and conservative leanings of the Italian fascist state under Mussolini and was not too reluctant to appoint a fascist government (with terms for the extent of Horthy's power). Horthy would keep control over the mainstream fascist movement in Hungary until near the end of the Second World War. However, G√∂mb√∂s never had a truly powerful fascist base of support. Instead, the radical Arrow Cross Party, which gained support in Budapest as well as the countryside, became a powerful political movement, gaining nearly 800,000 votes in the election of 1939. Horthy became paranoid due to his new rival, and imprisoned the Arrow Cross Party's leader, Ferenc Sz√°lasi. However, this action only increased popular support for the fascist movement. In another attempt to challenge the Arrow Cross, Horthy's government began to imitate the Arrow Cross Party's ideology. Starting in 1938, several racial laws, mostly against Jews, were passed by the regime, but the extremist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Sz√°lasi, was banned until German pressure lifted the law, and until Germany occupied Hungary during Operation Margarethe on March 19, 1944, no Jews were in direct danger of being annihilated. In July 1944, armor-colonel Ferenc Koszor√∫s and the First Armour Division, under Horthy's orders, resisted the Arrow Cross militia and prevented the deportation of the Jews of Budapest, thus saved over 200,000 lives. This act impressed upon the German occupying forces, including Adolf Eichmann, that as long as Hungary continued to be governed by Horthy, no real Endl√∂sung could begin. Following Horthy's attempt to have Hungary jump out of the war on October 15, Sz√°lasi, with German military support, launched Operation Panzerfaust and replaced Admiral Horthy as Head of State. The regime changed to a system more in line with Nazism and would remain this way until the capture of Budapest by Soviet troops. Over 400,000 Jews were sent by Hungary to German death camps from 1944 to 1945.Guy Miron, The Waning of Emancipation: Jewish History, Memory, and the Rise of Fascism in Germany, France, and Hungary (2011).Bod√≥, B√©la. \\"Paramilitary violence in Hungary after the first world war.\\" East European Quarterly 38.2 (2004): 129-173. =Norway (1942‚Äì1945)= Vidkun Quisling had staged a coup d'√©tat during the German invasion on April 9, 1940. This first government was replaced by a Nazi puppet government under his leadership from February 1, 1942. His party never had any substantial support in Norway, undermining his attempts to emulate the Italian fascist state. =Portugal (1933‚Äì1974)= The Estado Novo regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar borrowed many of the ideas towards military and governance from Mussolini's Fascist regime and adapted to the Portuguese example of paternal iconography for authoritarianism. However Salazar distanced himself from fascism and Nazism, which he criticized as a \\"pagan Caesarism\\" that recognized neither legal, religious nor moral limits. Unlike Mussolini or Hitler, Salazar never had the intention to create a party-state. Salazar was against the whole-party concept and in 1930 he created the National Union a single-party, which he marketed as a \\"non-party\\", announcing that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party. Salazar's aim was the depoliticization of society not the mobilization of populace. Salazar promoted Catholicism, but argued that the role of the Church was social, not political, and negotiated the Concordat of 1940. The true fascist movement was the National Syndicalists, also called the \\"Blue Shirts\\" (camisas azuis), who were active briefly between 1932 and 1934, following the tradition of uniformed right-wing paramilitary groups, they were an organisation advocating syndicalism and unionism, inspired by Benito Mussolini's brand of Italian Fascism. As Rol√£o Preto wrote in July 1922, ‚Äúour organic syndicalism is essentially the basis of current syndicalist thought among Mussolini‚Äôs friends‚Äù.Preto, R., ‚ÄòCr√≥nica social‚Äô, Na√ß√£o Portuguesa, 2¬™ s√©rie, N¬∫ 1, July 1922, p. 34. MNS was also built on previous allegiances to Integralismo Lusitano, but it was not inspired by the Action Fran√ßaise as alleged by their adversaries.Jos√© Hip√≥lito Raposo, Dois Nacionalismos - L'Action fran√ßaise e o Integralismo Lusitano, Lisboa, F√©rin, 1929. The leader Francisco Rol√£o Preto advocated the personalism of Emmanuel Mounier and some of the aspects of unionism. His unionist platform was based on leftist ideas of social justice, such as \\"a minimum family wage\\", \\"paid holidays\\", \\"working class education\\", and a world in which workers are \\"guaranteed the right to happiness\\". In 1934, Salazar banned the National Syndicalists. Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as \\"inspired by certain foreign models\\" and condemned their \\"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, and the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\\".* However, Salazar adopted many of the traits he criticized the National Syndicalists for. Most of the National Syndicalists eventually joined the National Union, the party of the Estado Novo regime. Historian Jonathan Petropoulos says that Portugal was neutral during World War II but that it was like Switzerland, Spain and Sweden in that Portugal \\"occupied a gray area on the continuum between black complicity with the Third Reich and white resistance to the Nazi regime.\\" Jonathan Petropoulos, \\"Co-Opting Nazi Germany: Neutrality in Europe During World War II.\\" Dimensions 14.1 (2000): 13+. excerpt The regime distanced itself from Fascism after the defeat of the Axis powers. =Poland (1930s)= During the 1930s, the rise of fascist-inspired organizations occurred in Poland. Fascist organizations like the Association of Polish Fascists (ZwiƒÖzek Faszyst√≥w Polskich) were however marginal and ephemeral. Fascist-inspired organizations were however stronger than parties with clearly fascist programs. National Radical Camp Falanga was the most prominent of them. It was created by radical youth members with National Democratic origins. Falanga was nonetheless quickly banned by the authoritarian ruling Sanacja regime and continued to operate clandestinely. It was also involved in frequent street violence and anti-Semitic riots. =Romania (1940‚Äì1944)= The Iron Guard turned more and more into a pro-Nazi and pro-German movement and took power in September 1940 when Ion Antonescu forced King Carol II to abdicate. However, the cohabitation between the Iron Guard and Ion Antonescu was short-lived. During the 1930s, the group combined a mix of Christian faith, antisemitism, and calls for land reform for farmers, who still lived in a quasi-feudal society. However, the extremely violent nature of the movement made it difficult for the Iron Guard to attract conservatives and middle class people, and as a result, the movement could never be as successful as the Nazi Party. The Antonescu regime that followed had elements of fascism, but it lacked a clear political program or party. It was more a military dictatorship. The regime was characterized by nationalism, antisemitism, and anti-communism, but had no social program. Despite the Ia≈üi pogrom and a near-liquidation of the Jews of many parts of Moldavia, the regime ultimately refused to send the Romanian Jews to German death camps. The regime was overthrown on 23 August 1944 in a coup led by the king Mihai of Romania. =Slovakia (1939‚Äì1945)= The Slovak People's Party was a quasi-fascist nationalist movement. It was associated with the Roman Catholic Church and founded by Father Andrej Hlinka. His successor Monsignor Jozef Tiso was a president of nominally independent Slovakia in 1939‚Äì1945. His government colleagues like Vojtech Tuka or Alexander Mach collaborate with fascism. The clerical element lends comparison with Austrofascism or the clerical fascism of Croatia, though not to the excesses of either model. The market system was run on principles agreeing with the standard Italian fascist model of industrial regulation. =Spain (1936‚Äì1975)= After the 1936 arrest and execution of its founder, Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, during the Spanish Civil War, the fascist Falange Espa√±ola Party was allied to and ultimately came to be dominated by General√≠simo Francisco Franco, who became known as El Caudillo, the undisputed leader of the Nationalist side in the war and, after victory, head of state until his death over 35 years later. =South Africa= There have been three waves of fascism in South Africa. Beginning with D F Malan's support of Hitler's brown shirts and the activities of Robey Leibbrandt in the 1930s and 1940s, the second wave during the 1970s and 1980s which created fringe right- wing groups such as the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging. = Yugoslavia (1935‚Äì1939) = Yugoslav Radical Union was a Yugoslav fascist group run by Milan Stojadinoviƒá. Party members wore green shirt uniforms, addressed Stojadinoviƒá as Vodja and used the Roman salute. The party was dissolved following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. Fascism in democratic nations Prior to World War II, fascist or quasi-fascist movements also appeared in democratic nations, often taking their inspiration from the regimes established by Mussolini and Hitler. =Australia (1931‚Äì1940s)= The New Guard was founded in Sydney in 1931 and was opposed to the rule of the then New South Wales premier Jack Lang. The organisation was pro-Monarchy and anti- Communist and was led by Great War veteran Eric Campbell. At its height, the New Guard had a membership of over 50,000 and was almost exclusively based in New South Wales. Following the dismissal of the Lang government in 1932, the New Guard lost much of its momentum and officially disbanded in 1935.https://web.archive.org/web/20190305044027/http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact- sheets/fs183.aspx Another Fascist movement was the short-lived anti-semitic, anti-Communist and Nazi-inspired Australia First Movement founded by former communist Percy Stephensen.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-17/a-history- of-nazis-and-the-far-right-in- australia/10713514?pfmredir=sm&section;=politics] The organisation was founded in October 1941 and existed until March 1942 when it was suppressed by Australian security agencies who believed the movement was supportive of the Axis Powers. Its leaders (including Stephensen) and several members were also interned.https://web.archive.org/web/20190330050831/http://naa.gov.au/collection/fact- sheets/fs28.aspx In terms of National Socialism, a tiny movement was founded among South Australia's German Australian community by Johannes Becker, a German migrant who arrived in Australia in 1927.https://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/barossa-lied-about-war-injustice/news- story/9e77978638626617afc5da1c8cc057b2?sv=7b82061835890da72d15bd6aaa9f8662https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-17/a-history- of-nazis-and-the-far-right-in-australia/10713514?pfmredir=sm&section;=politics Becker had joined the NSDAP in 1932 and was appointed State Leader (Landeskreisleiter) for the South Pacific the following year. Following the outbreak of World War II, Becker was interned and released in 1946, then deported to West Germany the following year.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/becker-johannes-heinrich-9467 =Canada (1930s‚Äì1940)= In the 1930s, Canada had fascist fringe groups within it. One stronger group was the Parti national social chr√©tien of Adrien Arcand which had significant support. Arcand believed in the anti-Semitic policies of Hitler and called himself the \\"Canadian F√ºhrer\\". In 1934, his Quebec-based party merged with the western-based fascist Nationalist Party of Canada. In 1938, the English Canadian and French Canadian fascist movements united into the National Unity Party. The only fascist politician ever to be elected in Canada was a man by the name of P. M. Campbell who ran and won under the fascist Unity Party of Alberta for Lethbridge in a 1937 Alberta Provincial By- Election. In 1940, all fascist parties were banned under Canada's War Measures Act. =Belgium (1930s‚Äì1945)= The Rexist movement and the Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond party achieved some electoral success in the 1930s. The party could be label as clerical fascist with its roots in Catholic Conservatism. The party gained rapid support for a brief period, focusing on the secularism, corruption, and ineffectiveness on parliamentary democracy in Belgium. Many of its members assisted the Nazi occupation during World War II. The Verdinaso movement, too, can be considered fascist. Its leader, Joris Van Severen, was killed before the Nazi occupation. Some of its adepts collaborated, but others joined the resistance. These collaborationist movements are generally classified as belonging to the National Socialist model or the German fascist model because of its brand of racial nationalism and the close relation with the occupational authorities. =Ireland (1932‚Äì1933)= Fascist sympathizers led by General Eoin O'Duffy established the Army Comrades Association, or \\"Blueshirts\\" in 1932 as a veterans organization. Renamed the National Guard, it eventually became the paramilitary wing of the United Ireland Party. The Blueshirts wanted to establish a corporate state in Ireland and frequently clashed with Republican supporters of the ruling Fianna F√°il, who were using force to disrupt that party's meetings. O‚ÄôDuffy planned a parade in Dublin in 1933, and the government, fearing a coup, banned the organization. The organization began to decline soon after. Blueshirts under O‚ÄôDuffy's leadership later fought for Franco during the Nationalist uprising in Spain. =Mexico (1930‚Äì1942)= A reactionary nationalist movement called Acci√≥n Revolucionaria Mexicana (Mexican Revolutionary Action), founded by former Villista general Nicolas Rodriguez Carrasco, agitated for right-wing causes, such as the deportation of Jews and Chinese-Mexicans, throughout the 1930s. ARM maintained a paramilitary force called the Goldshirts, which clashed frequently with Communist activists, and supported the presidential faction of Plutarco Calles against the liberal reformist president L√°zaro C√°rdenas. The paramilitary group was banned in 1936 and the ARM officially disbanded in 1942, when Mexico declared war against the Axis. =The Netherlands (1923‚Äì1945)= The Verbond van Actualisten (Union of Actualists) was the oldest fascist movement in the Netherlands. It was established on 22 January 1923 and its ideology was based on Mussolini's Italian fascist movement. It ceased all activities in November 1928 after having had no success at all. It was succeeded by the Vereeniging De Bezem (Association 'The Broom') which was founded on 15 December 1928 by some men who previously were active in the Verbond van Actualisten. Its aim was to clean Dutch politics ‚Äì hence the name. Its downfall in 1932 was caused by continuous discord between its leaders. On 14 December 1931 Anton Mussert and Cornelis van Geelkerken founded the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland (NSB), the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands. It started as a fascist movement, Italian style, but at the same time its ideology was based on Hitlers NSDAP. In the years 1935‚Äì1936 the party embraced antisemitism. Its best pre-war election result was 7,9% of the voters (1935). The maximum number of member of the NSB was 100,000 (around 1,25% of the Dutch population). Soon after the German occupation in May 1940 the NSB became the only allowed political party. Never once during the years of WW II the NSB was giving any real power, instead, the Germans used the NSB for their own purposes. After the German defeat, the NSB disappeared. On 29 June 1932 Jan Baars (previously active in the Vereeniging 'De Bezem') founded the Algemeene Nederlandsche Fascisten Bond (General Dutch Fascist Federation). It was the first Dutch fascist political party to gain significant election results and it had a considerable number of members. Its political views were quite moderate and it disapproved German Nazi racism and antisemitism. It ended its existence in 1934. Its main successful successor was Zwart Front (Black Front), 1934‚Äì1941. Its leaders were of a Catholic origin and the party was strongly based on Italian fascism. During the pre-war period, it never established a prominent position like Mussert's NSB. After the German invasion in May 1940, the number of members rose from 4,000 to 12,000. The Germans prohibited Zwart Front in December 1941. Other, smaller, fascist and Nazi parties were: Verbond van Nationalisten (Union of Nationalists, 1928‚Äì1934), the Nationaal-Socialistische Nederlandsche Arbeiders Partij (National Socialist Dutch Workers Party, 1931‚Äì1941), Nationaal- Socialistische Partij (National Socialist Party, 1932‚Äì1941), Nederlandsche Fascisten Unie (Dutch Fascist Union, 1933), Unie van Nederlandsche Fascisten (Union of Dutch Fascists, 1933), Oranje-Fascisten (Orange Fascists, 1933), Frysk Fascisten Front (Frisian Fascist Front, 1933), Corporatieve Concentratie (Corporative Concentration, 1933‚Äì1934), Verbond voor Nationaal Herstel (Union for National Restoration, 1933‚Äì1941), Nederlandsche Nationaal-Socialistische Partij (Dutch National Socialist Party, 1935) and the Nederlandsche Volkspartij (Dutch People's Party, 1938‚Äì1940). Dutch fascism and Nazism is known for its lack of coherence and it was dominated by the egos of its leaders. An important fact for its marginal position in pre-war Dutch politics was the absence of a 'lost generation' of combatants of WW I. =Lebanon= In Lebanon, the Kataeb Party (Phalange) was formed in 1936, with inspiration of the Spanish Falange and Italian Fascism. The founder of the party, Pierre Gemayel, founded the party after returning from a visit at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The party is still active today, although it has abandoned the Falangist and Fascist ideology in place of Phoenicianism, social Conservatism, Republicanism, and anti-Islam. =Sweden (1926‚Äì1929)= The Sveriges Fascistiska Folkparti (SFF; \\"Fascist People's Party of Sweden\\") was founded in 1926. Major figures of the party included its founding leader, Konrad Hallgren, a former German officer, and Swedish soldiers Sven Olov Lindholm and Sven Hedengren. In 1929 a delegation of the party, led by Hallgren and Lindholm, attended a major rally of the German Nazi party, at Nuremberg. Afterwards, the SFF was more strongly influenced by Nazism and changed its name to Sveriges Nationalsocialistiska Folkparti (SNF; Swedish National Socialist People's Party). The SNF was one of several Swedish Nazi parties. =United Kingdom (1932‚Äì1940)= Sir Oswald Mosley, an admirer of Mussolini, established the British Union of Fascists in 1932 as a nationalist alternative to the three mainstream political parties in Britain. Though the BUF achieved only limited success in some local elections, their existence caused frequent riots, usually instigated by Communist movements. Alarmed at the violence caused by the BUF, the government passed the Public Order Act in 1936 to restrict its activity. During the latter years of the decade, the party experienced a revival in popularity on the back of its anti-war campaign. The BUF was banned in 1940 and Mosley was interned for the duration of the war. The relative stability of democratic institutions, the long-time assimilation of Jews, and the lack of a strong, threatening Communist movement, had made it difficult for fascism to succeed in Britain.G. C. Webber, \\"Patterns of Membership and Support for the British Union of Fascists\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1984) 19#4 pp. 575-606 online =United States of America (1933-1941)= Louisiana governor and politician Huey Long built a powerful state machine and at the time of his assassination in 1935 was building a national following. Writers on the far left and far right did call him a fascist. Historians reject the designation. In the late 1930s some pro- German organizations seemed comfortable with fascist ideals. The Silver Legion of America (1933-1941), claiming around 15,000 members, managed to run a candidate for President on a third-party ticket, but was outlawed after Nazi Germany's declaration of war on the United States in late 1941. The German- American Bund openly supported Nazi Germany, and, like the Silver Legion, was banned during World War Two. Charles Coughlin, a Roman Catholic priest, used his nationally syndicated radio show to promote anti-Semitic and pro-fascist views.Carl A. Sokoll, The German-American Bund as a model for American Fascism, 1924-1946 (Columbia UP, 1974). Differences among fascist movements Despite the arousal of fascist movements across Europe and the world, many were different in their nature in ideology. Some, like the Iron Guard and Arrow Cross Party, had strong support among the proletariat. This was unlike Nazism and Italian Fascism, which relied more on the support of the middle class. Meanwhile, some regimes, especially those appointed by Hitler like Vichy France, was made up of the conservative and aristocratic elite. Others also had different degrees of Catholic elements. Some groups, like the ones in Croatia, Austria, Belgium, and Slovakia, had its roots in reactionary and populist Catholicism. The Iron Guard also had strong religious influences and was defined, by its leaders, as more of a religious order than a political party. Fascist leaders like Francisco Franco and Vidkun Quisling tried to stage direct military coups, while other fascist groups formed political parties and tried to take power through the existing democratic process, such as Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists.

It relates to the behavioral aspects of the use of operations research and operations management. In particular, it focuses on understanding behavior in, with and beyond models. The general purpose is to make better use and improve the use of operations theories and practice, so that the benefits received from the potential improvements to operations approaches in practice, that arise from recent findings in behavioral sciences, are realized. Behavioral operations approaches have heavily influenced supply chain management research among others. Overview Operations management involves a wide range of problem‚Äìsolving skills aiming to help individuals or organizations to make more rational decisions as well as improving their efficiency. However, operations management often assumes that agents involved in the process or operating system, such as employees, consumers and suppliers, make fully rational decisions. Their decisions are not affected by their emotions as well as their surroundings and that they are able to react and distinguish between different types of information. In reality, this is not always true; human behavior has an important role in decision making and worker motivation, and therefore should be considered in the study of operations. This has led to the rise of behavioral operations management, which is defined as the study of impacts that human behavior has on operations, design and business interactions in different organizations. Behavioral operations management aims to understand the decision making of managers and tries to make improvements to the supply chain using the insight obtained. Behavioral operations management includes knowledge from a number of fields, such as economics, behavioral science, psychology and other social sciences. Traditional operations management and behavioral operations management have a common intellectual goal, aiming to make differences in operations outcomes, such as flexibility, efficiency and productivity. Theoretical influence Humans have limitations in their ability to collect and react to relevant information. When a decision or conclusion has to be made through complex information, human decision-makers often fail to comply with normative decision theories. Moreover, a person's lifestyle, social interactions and collective behaviors have a clear influence on their decisions. 194x194px =Cognitive psychology= This is a relatively new branch of psychology which focuses on humans' ability to make decisions, solve problems, learning, attention, memory and forgetting. These are only a few of the practical applications of this science, to some extent it is also related to motivation and emotion. Cognitive psychology is interested in what is happening within the mind when new information is received, how people respond to this information, and how this response affects their behavior and emotions. Cognitive psychology is considered to be one of the dominant theoretical force in behavioral science. =Social psychology= The Asch experiment shows that participants tend to adhere to the group norms People often react and behave differently when they are put into different social situations. The aim of social psychology is to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviors. It questions or provides an insight of how human behavior relies on the physical environment.Argyle, M., Collett, P. and Furnham, A. (1995). Social psychology at work. London: Routledge, p.271. Social psychology theories attempt to explain why there are competition between individuals, why it is often the case that individuals or organisations seek to protect and maintain their status, and why it has been observed that individuals and organisations are willing to sacrifice efficiency to achieve their goal of staying at a higher hierarchical position. In addition to status, social psychology also includes people's behavior towards goal setting, feedback and controls, interdependence, and reciprocity. =Organizational behavior= The use of psychology in behavioral operations research links to the idea of judging the relationship between people's mental health and wellbeing and their behavior at work. Psychology experts often set up indicators to evaluate how an employee's surroundings, such as working environment and noise, can affect their productivity. Organizational behavior is the study of ways people react or behave when they are organized in groups. The purpose of these studies is to improve business productivity, trying to create a more efficient business organization. Organizational behavior theories are applied towards human resource trying to maximize the output from individual group members. The study of organization behavior can be broken down into different sections, including personality, job satisfaction and reward management, leadership, authority, power and politics. Main streams of research There are four main streams of research that can be considered a part of behavior operations research. These give us an idea of the weakness of the current operations research model and the effectiveness of behavioral operations research in predicting human decisions and reactions when facing different situations. =Socio-technical view of technology management= Physical technologies can be defined as a socio-technology system, which consists of humans, human activity, spaces, artifacts, tools, and communications media. This theory suggests that social interaction at the workplace is determined by the technology and techniques used at work. Therefore, a change in technology used at work can lead to unexpected consequences. This may include differences in motivation. =Human factor engineering= Human factor engineering can be applied to improve workplaces, working systems and products aiming to reduce human errors during operations as well as improving human efficiency, productivity and operational performance. It often involves improvements of large machineries to reduce accidents during work. It is believed that behavior operations research can be related to human factor engineering as systematic errors, which happens very often technology and different machineries, can affect people's decision making and their interaction with the operating system. 300x300px =The bullwhip effect= The bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain as the result of information asymmetry between the organisations involved. The classic scenario is a sudden increase in customer demand as shown in the figure to the right. The sudden demand hike depletes the retailer's stock resulting in lost sales. To avoid this happen in the future, the retailer does not only increase its next order to the wholesaler by the additional customer demand observed in this period, but by a little bit more just to be safe. That is because the retailer knows it takes time for the wholesaler to deliver the larger order. This fear of losing out in future sales is the behavioral component of the inventory problem causing the bullwhip effect. Faced with an unexpectedly larger order by the retailer, the wholesaler will forward an even larger order to the manufacturer. The manufacturer in turn makes a non- reversible decision to increase its production level even more in the nearer future. However because of the delay in information flow from customers to manufactures, the latter is not aware for several order periods that its production level actually exceeds customer demand considerably. The result of the bullwhip effect in this classic application is an excessive amount of stock held by retailers, wholesalers and manufacturer. The more tiers a supply chain has, the larger the magnitude of the bullwhip effect becomes. =System dynamics models in operations contexts= System dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear. Related problems =Newsvendor problem= The newsvendor model (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity to make more profit and suffers loss of goodwill. thumb278x278px Heuristic performance regarding the secretary problem ‚Äì Expected success probabilities for three heuristics =Assignment problem= The assignment problem is a complex optimization problem. The problem involves number of agents and a number of tasks. The purpose is to assign each agent with a task. All agents are expected or aimed to be allocated in a way that will maximize productivity and efficiency and minimize the total cost of the assignment. =Secretary problem= The secretary problem can also be called the optimal stopping theory. It focuses heavily on applied probability, statistics and decision theory. The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.

Now found worldwide, the species is considered to be of Eurasian origin. Physical features The stable fly resembles the common housefly (Musca domestica), though smaller, and on closer examination has a slightly wider and spotted abdomen. Adults are generally about in length and a lighter color than the housefly. Unlike the housefly, where the mouth part is adapted for sponging, the stable fly mouth parts have biting structures. Habitat As its name suggests, the stable fly is abundant in and around where cattle are kept. Its maggots are often seen in the rotting manure near cattle and poultry. Biology Stomoxys calcitrans laying an egg The earliest and one of the most comprehensive accounts of stable fly biology was presented by F. Bishop in 1913. The adults of both sexes feed on the blood of warm-blooded animals during the daytime. For egg production, the female requires its abdomen to be engorged with blood. The female takes approximately 2‚Äì5 minutes to engorge, after which it becomes sluggish for a while. The eggs are laid among putrefying organic materials such as hay, manure, and wood. Males usually die after mating and the females after laying eggs. The life cycle has a duration of about two weeks at temperatures around . The duration is highly dependent on temperature and nutrient quality available for the larvae. Bishop (1913) noted that the larvae can endure for more than 30 days in less nutritious environs. Economic importance Cattle heavily infested with stable flies have been noted to become anemic and milking cows have been observed to show lower milk production. The stable fly bites humans at rest in the outdoors. In many parts of the world, the species is a carrier of trypanosomid parasites. Some of the reported parasites and diseases for which the stable fly might be a vector include Trypanosoma evansi (the agent of Surra), Trypanosoma brucei, brucellosis, equine infectious anemia, African horse sickness (AHS), and fowlpox. S. calcitrans is also reported to be a vector of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax.

It is based in Miami, Florida.  Background  The group officially began in Havana, Cuba in 1926, though its groundwork was laid throughout the 1920s. It was founded by Felipe Rey de Castro, a Spaniard Jesuit and professor in the prestigious \\"Palace of Education\\" Belen Jesuit Preparatory School founded by Queen Isabela II of Spain.https://www.belenjesuit.org/about/at-a- glance The ACU has therefore maintained close ties with both the Society of Jesus and Belen Jesuit from its inception with many alumni and instructors serving as members. Following the rise of the Castro regime with the Cuban Revolution and its anti-religion policies, the organization relocated to the United States in the 1960s where it began in Miami and has since spread to other cities. The ACU has been mentioned in several books, including Presencia en Cuba del catolicismo apuntes hist√≥ricos del siglo veinte (1998) and ¬°Presente!: U.S. Latino Catholics from Colonial Origins to the Present (2015) and the subject of the 2020 book History of the Agrupacion Catolica Universitaria. = Leadership = ACU's first two directors were Spaniard Jesuits residing in Cuba. The organization's founder, Fr. Rey de Castro, led the ACU from the 1920s until his death in 1952. He was followed as director by Fr. Armando Llorente, S.J., who led the ACU for nearly sixty years. Llorente became a high-profile figure in the broader Cuban Catholic community and oversaw the group's migration from Cuba to the United States, leading it in Miami through the later half of the 20th century and the start of the 21st century until his death in 2010. He was also noted for having taught Fidel Castro in Belen Jesuit.https://www.jesuit.org.uk/political-activist-and- priest-fidel-castro-and-his-jesuit-mentor In a 2015 visit to the island, Pope Francis gifted Castro a book on Llorente.https://www.lainformacion.com/asuntos-sociales/el-papa-regalo-a- fidel-un-libro-de-armando-llorente-el-jesuita-espanol-que-habia-sido-su-tutor- en-la-habana_kHwXVXc6ClUuDUKKHCOEd/ Though not a director, another important ACU leader during the lead-up of the Cuban Revolution was the prominent Cuban psychiatrist Rene de la Huerta, who continued to be an active figure and writer for the group following their relocation to the United States. In 2010 Fr. Armando Llorente, S.J., was followed by Belen Jesuit President Fr. Guillermo Garc√≠a-Tu√±√≥n, S.J., until its current director, Fr. Christian Saenz, S.J. (another Belen Jesuit alumnus), assumed the role in 2019. Garc√≠a-Tu√±√≥n is now serving as Assistant Ecclesiastical Director and Erik Viera is their Pastoral Administrator. = Members = Members of the Agrupaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Universitaria are known as \\"Agrupados\\" or \\"Congregantes.\\" ACU membership is largely composed of educated Catholic South Florida leaders of various professions with the intent of facilitating Christian service in service their communtiees. Their affiliate site through Belen Jesuit states that the ACU's goals for their members are \\"to fulfill man's purpose in life through individual perfection, conceived as apostolic action executed within one's own intellectual means, in order to occupy an influential position of true spiritual leadership. Such leadership is sought to influence decisions made in society, so that society may be brought into accordance with the path that will lead it to God.\\" ACU members include prominent and leading doctors, phiosophers, bankers, attorneys, architects, artists, and engineers. It is a Marian Congregation (CM) rooted in and guided by Jesuit principals and practices, such as the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Their philosophy calls for the balance and development of \\"spiritual life, professional life, and apostolic life\\" and their official motto is \\"Esto Vir\\" (\\"To be courageous/To be a man\\"). Though largely based in Miami, there are also ACU Houses in Washington D.C., Atlanta, and Puerto Rico.

The participation of Moroccan regulars and Italian tanks from the recently arrived Corpo Truppe Volontarie resulted in a complete rout of the Spanish Republican Army and the capitulation of M√°laga in less than a week. Prelude After the failure to capture Madrid and the Republican counter attack at the Battle of the Corunna Road, the Nationalists sought to regain the initiative. A 25 mile wide strip of land in southern Spain along the Mediterranean Sea centering on M√°laga, a base of the Spanish Republican Navy, was held by the Republicans and the arrival of Italian troops at the nearby port of C√°diz made an attack on M√°laga logical.Beevor, Antony.

Both attacks encountered little resistance and made advances of up to 15 miles in a week. The Republicans failed to realize that the Nationalists were concentrating for an attack on M√°laga and thus they remained unreinforced and unprepared for the main attack on February 3.Beevor, Antony.

Plans to capture Valencia were abandoned in order to achieve a decisive victory by attacking and capturing Madrid. Koestler Depiction An eye-witness depiction of the Battle of M√°laga is given by Arthur Koestler in both his 1937 Dialogue with Death and the 1953 The Invisible Writing. Koestler had come to Malaga as a journalist writing for the British News Chronicle and actually also for the propaganda department of the Comintern. At the city's fall he was captured by Nationalist forces and narrowly avoided being put to death out of hand, thanks largely to the intervention of Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell. A full account is given in Sir Peter's memoir, My House in M√°laga, published in 1938. Notes References *Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Penguin Books. 2006.

Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal (fl. 971) was an eminent tenth-century Cumbrian who slew Cuil√©n mac Illuilb, King of Alba in 971. Rhydderch was possibly a son of Dyfnwal ab Owain, King of Strathclyde, and could have ruled as King of Strathclyde. Rhydderch appears on record in about 971, when he is said to have killed Cuil√©n mac Illuilb, King of Alba, a man said to have abducted and raped Rhydderch's daughter. Following Cuil√©n's death, the Cumbrian Kingdom of Strathclyde endured an invasion by Cuil√©n's successor, Cin√°ed mac Ma√≠l Choluim, King of Alba. This Scottish attack could have been a retaliatory raid for Rhydderch's actions, and may have been undertaken in the context of restoring Scottish authority over the Cumbrian realm. If Rhydderch ever ruled as king it must have been before 973, when Dyfnwal's son, M√°el Coluim, is accorded the title king. Attestation Locations relating to the life and times of Rhydderch.

Cuil√©n's death in 971 is noted by several sources.

Although there is no specific evidence that Rhydderch was himself a king,Macquarrie (2004); Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. the fact that Cuil√©n was involved with his daughter, coupled with the fact that his warband was evidently strong enough to overcome that of Cuil√©n, suggests that Rhydderch must have been a man of eminent standing.Macquarrie (2004). At about the time of Cuil√©n's demise, a granddaughter of Dyfnwal could well have been in her teens or twenties, and it is possible that the recorded events refer to a visit by the King of Alba to the court of the King of Strathclyde. Such a visit may have taken place in the context of Cuil√©n exercising his lordship over the Britons. His dramatic death suggests that the Scots severely overstepped the bounds of hospitality,Woolf (2009) p. 258; Woolf (2007) p. 205; Hudson (1996) pp. 213‚Äì214. and could indicate that Rhydderch was compelled to fire his own hall. Certainly, such killings are not unknown in Icelandic and Irish sources.Woolf (2007) p. 205. The Lothian placename of West Linton appears as in the twelfth century. The fact that the place name seems to refer to a man named Rhydderch could indicate that this was the place where Cuil√©n and Eochaid met their end.Woolf (2007) p. 205 n. 40. Another possible scenario concerns the record of Cuil√©n's father's seizure of Edinburgh preserved by the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a conquest which would have included at least part of Lothian.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂¬∂ 16‚Äì18, 24; Hudson (1998) pp. 151, 159; Anderson (1922) p. 468; Skene (1867) p. 10. The records that appear to locate Cuil√©n's fall to Lothian, therefore, could indicate that he was in the midst of exercising overlordship of this debatable land when Rhydderch seized the chance to exact revenge upon the abductor of his daughter.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 24. The title of Dyfnwal ab Owain as it appears on folio 33v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 975.2; The Annals of Ulster (2008) 975.2; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). Irish sources accord him the title r√≠ Bretan (\\"King of the Britons\\").Edmonds (2014) p. 208; Broun (2007) p. 94 n. 62; Busse (2006c). It is unknown if Rhydderch was himself a king.Macquarrie (1998) p. 16. Certainly, the Annals of Ulster accords Dyfnwal's son and successor, M√°el Coluim, the title (\\"King of the Northern Britons\\").Edmonds (2014) p. 208; The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 997.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) 997.5; Broun (2007) p. 94 n. 62; Macquarrie (2004). Rhydderch is only attested in sources outlining Cuil√©n's demise and is not heard of again.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 34; Macquarrie (2004). Cuil√©n was succeeded by Cin√°ed mac Ma√≠l Choluim, a fellow member of the Alp√≠nid dynasty.Broun (2004a); Broun (2004b). One of Cin√°ed's first acts as King of Alba was evidently an invasion of the Kingdom of Strathclyde.Williams (2014); Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 25; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¬∂ 30; Oram (2011) ch. 5; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35; Woolf (2009) p. 259; Busse (2006a); Broun (2004b). This campaign could well have been a retaliatory response to Cuil√©n's killing,Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 7; Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 25; Woolf (2009) p. 259. carried out in the context of crushing a British affront to Scottish authority.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¬∂ 25. Whatever the case, Cin√°ed's invasion ended in defeat,Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35; Broun (2004b). a fact which coupled with Cuil√©n's killing reveals that the Cumbrian realm was indeed a power to be reckoned with.McGuigan (2015) p. 140; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¬∂ 28; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35. According to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, Cin√°ed constructed some sort of fortification on the River Forth, perhaps at the strategically located Fords of Frew near Stirling.Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¬∂ 30; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 37; Broun (2007) p. 54; Hicks (2003) pp. 41‚Äì42; Davidson (2002) pp. 147‚Äì148, 147 n. 167; Hudson (1998) pp. 151, 161; Hudson (1994) p. 96; Breeze (1992); Anderson (1922) p. 512; Skene (1867) p. 10. One possibility is that this engineering project was undertaken in the context of limiting Cumbrian incursions.Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¬∂ 30; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 37. Whilst it is conceivable that Rhydderch could have succeeded Dyfnwal by the time of Cuil√©n's fall,Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. another possibility is that Dyfnwal was still the king, and that Cin√°ed's strike into Cumbrian territory was the last conflict of Dyfnwal's reign.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 35. In fact, Dyfnwal's son M√°el Coluim seems to have taken up the Cumbrian kingship by 973, as evidenced by the latter's act of apparent submission to Edgar, King of the English that year. This could indicate that, if Rhydderch was indeed a son of Dyfnwal, he was either dead or unable to reign as king by 973. Rhydderch's name appears in many variations in surviving sources. Whilst some of these names appear to be forms of , an established British name, others are apparently forms of Amdarch,Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¬∂ 6; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¬∂ 32; Broun (2005) p. 86 n. 27; Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66; Broun (1999) p. 137 n. 30; Broun (1998) p. 200 n. 40; Macquarrie (1998) pp. 16, 18; Anderson (1922) p. 476, 476 n. 1; Skene (1867) p. 151. an otherwise unknown name that may be the result of textual corruptions.Broun (2005) p. 86 n. 27; Broun (1999) p. 137 n. 30; Jackson (1975) p. 99.

Earlier, he worked on computational solutions of problems emerging in theoretical physics. He is also known for his contributions to economics, specifically for proposing corrections and calculating price formation for the USSR. Later, Kronrod gave his fortune and life to medicine to care for terminal cancer patients. Kronrod is remembered for his captivating personality and was admired as a student, teacher and leader. He is the author of several well known books, including \\"Nodes and weights of quadrature formulas. Sixteen- place tables\\" and \\"Conversations on Programming\\". A biographer wrote Kronrod gave ideas \\"away left and right, quite honestly being convinced that the authorship belongs to the one who implements them.\\" Education Kronrod was born in Moscow. Growing up, he studied math with D. O. Shklyarsky in school and in 1938 entered the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University. He did his first independent mathematical work as a freshman with Professor A. O. Gel'fond. Kronrod was honored as a student with the first prize of the Moscow Mathematical Society and was the only person to win the prize twice. During World War II he was rejected for military service because at the time graduate level students were exempt. They did help to build trenches around Moscow, and when he returned, Kronrod reapplied and was accepted. He served twice, and was injured twice. He was awarded several medals, including Order of the Red Star and Order of the Patriotic War. The second injury in 1943 hospitalised him for a year and he was discharged from the army in 1944. This injury made him an invalid of sorts for life. Kronrod was married and about this time his son was born. During next four years he continued his studies at the University, simultaneously working at the Atomic Energy Kurchatov Institute. There he chose to leave pure mathematics and pursue computational mathematics. In his last undergraduate year, Kronrod studied with Nikolai Luzin the teacher of many of the Soviet Union's finest scientists. Kronrod and Georgy Adelson-Velsky were colleagues and Luzin's last students. Like his teacher, Kronrod led a series of supplementary seminars for younger mathematics students. Unusually for the time, instead of students merely reporting on the content of courses, Kronrod made his students undertake training exercises, even proving basic theorems themselves. The preparation required for this reduced the numbers of participants, but those who remained, including R. A. Minlos and A. G. Vitushkin, derived great benefit. Vitushkin described him as \\"witty and friendly\\". At his own request, Kronrod was called simply \\"Sasha\\" by his students. He was considered to be a prophet in his field. The Kronod circle met between 1946-1953. Kronrod's position was formally at the Institute of Physics, which meant that his students had to register with other advisers, accounting for the decline of the circle into a series of friendly meetings. When he defended thesis in 1949, his committee including M. V. Keldish, A. N. Kolmogorov and D. E. Men'shov bypassed the Candidate of Sciences degree and awarded him a Doctor of Sciences degree in the physical-mathematical sciences. Kronrod taught at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute. Yevgeniy Landis was a student, early collaborator and one of his biographers. During the 1960s he worked on mathematics education in high schools by organizing courses and teaching methods. Computer science Kronod played an important role in building the first major Russian computer, Relay Computer RVM-1, though he liked to say his colleague N.I. Bessonov was the sole inventor. At the Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEF or ITEP) during 1950-1955 Kronod collaborated with physicists, among them Isaak Pomeranchuk and Lev Landau. For providing theoretical physics with numerical solutions he received the Stalin Prize and an Order of the Red Banner. In 1955 he first used an electronic computer at the Krzhizhanovskii laboratory of the Institute of Energy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, later called the Institute for Electronic Control Machines. He directed the mathematics division of ITEP. They could surpass the results achieved outside the USSR by far faster machines, in the case of CERN in Geneva, five hundred times faster. Requests for computation were analyzed and sometimes solved by other means. The equipment was maintained and there were almost no hardware malfunctions. A policy said finished programs had to be re-examined if they ran for more than ten minutes. Excerpt from the form for ITEP mathematics programs, in \\"Remembering A. S. Kronrod\\" by E.M. Landis and I.M. Yaglom. Kronrod rewarded accuracy. He held what today are controversial views on the role of gender in computing. He employed women in ITEP's coding and card punching groups, believing that female computing staff members are more accurate than males. He also believed that in order to think, the male scientists qualified to use the computers needed to be free from operating them. The women did the input and quality assurance side by side with the men and for each month without an error received a 20% raise in salary. He applied computing resources to the USSR planned economy and to cancer research. He served with Leonid Kantorovich and others on a cabinet ministry commission and oversaw the computation of the country's material expenditures to correct price formation. Kronrod's student V. D. Belkin further developed this work. At the Gertsen cancer research institute during the 1960s, with his student P. E. Kunin he studied the differential diagnostics of lung cancer and pneumonia to help doctors determine when surgery is needed. Artificial intelligence Kronrod had a profound interest in artificial intelligence known in the USSR at the time as heuristic programming. He is well known for saying, \\"chess is the Drosophila of artificial intelligence.\\" This quote graces the top of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence \\"Games & Puzzles\\" chess home page. In 1965 ITEP challenged and in 1966-1967 defeated the American chess program Kotok-McCarthy. The developers included Adelson-Velsky who used A.L. Brudno's adversarial search algorithm and a \\"general recursive search scheme\\" by Kronrod. They were advised by Russian chess master A.R. Bitman and world champion Mikhail Botvinnik in what was the first test of Shannon brute force vs. selective search. Kronrod's participation came at great cost. The physics users at ITEP complained, thinking that the lab was being used for game playing, when the division was writing the Crazy Eights card game and chess trying to teach a machine to think. End of a career When the Communist Party reprimanded him in 1968 for cosigning a letter with many mathematicians in defense of the mathematician and logician Alexander Esenin-Volpin, a son of the poet Sergei Esenin, the physicists were able to oust him from ITEP. He was also fired from his professorship. He then directed the mathematics laboratory at the Central Scientific Research Institute of Patent Information (CNIIPI) where he proposed patent reform to stimulate inventions. After gaining support he lost this position to an unsympathetic director. His last position was heading a Central Geophysical Expedition laboratory that processed drilling data where he made calculations for gas and oil exploration, but he was not challenged by this work. He re-examined his goals and soon changed course. Medicine Kronrod decided that his best work was to help others and most importantly the terminally ill. He spent his fortune developing milil from a sour milk extract for cancer patients, to fill a shortage of anabol, an expensive drug developed in small quantities by his acquaintance Bogdanov in Bulgaria. He was promised but never acquired an animal testing laboratory so he tested the medicine on himself. Kronrod had no medical degree but he was well-informed in medicine. Milil was a last resort for seriously ill patients and was administered by physicians in one case in a hospital ward A.A. Vishnevskiy reserved for treatments by Kronrod's method. Kronrod himself never gave the drug to patients and through physicians gave it away free. The drug was unapproved and a criminal case was brought against him. He regained his research records when a relative of the plaintiff required milil for treatment and the case was dismissed. He slowly recovered when a stroke took his speech and ability to read and write but was forced to resign at the Central Geophysical Expedition and stop all work on math. He saved his own life by asking to be soaked in a tub of very hot water for several hours after a second stroke. He died on 6 October 1986 of a third stroke.

Founded in 1974 by Hans Morgenthau, the organization works to identify, articulate, and advance U.S. foreign-policy interests within the framework of political realism. Mission The U.S. foreign-policy interests of the NCAFP include: * Preserving and strengthening national security * Supporting countries committed to the values and practice of political, religious, and cultural pluralism * Improving U.S. relations with the developed and developing worlds * Advancing human rights * Encouraging realist arms-control agreements * Curbing the proliferation of nuclear and other unconventional weapons * Promoting an open and global economy The organization believes that an informed public is vital to a democratic society. To promote this, it offers educational programs to its members and general audiences that address security challenges facing the U.S. and publishes a variety of publications, including the bimonthly journal, American Foreign Policy Interests. History The National Committee was founded in 1974 by Hans J. Morgenthau and others dedicated to the resolution of conflicts that threaten U.S. interests. The National Committee grew quickly in size and influence. It held public seminars regularly, assembled task forces in order to analyze areas of critical concern to the United States, and published journals and pamphlets containing summaries and policy recommendations derived from high-level conferences and briefings featuring American and foreign policymakers. In 1981, the first Hans J. Morgenthau Award was presented to NCAFP president Angier Biddle Duke. Subsequent recipients have included Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker III, the Margaret Thatcher, and Colin Powell. A second award, the George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service, was established in 1994. Recipients include George F. Kennan, the Cyrus R. Vance, the Paul A. Volcker, Richard C. Holbrooke, John D. Negroponte, and General David H. Petraeus. In 1993 William J. Flynn, chairman and chief executive officer of Mutual of America, became the chairman of the National Committee. When the British and Irish governments issued the Downing Street Declaration at the end of that year, the National Committee under his leadership placed a full-page ad in The New York Times challenging every party involved in the conflict to attend an NCAFP-sponsored conference to air the arguments of all sides. The National Committee was instrumental in convincing President Bill Clinton to issue a visa to Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn F√©in. Adams's first appearance in the United States enabled him to begin to develop ties with key leaders in New York and Washington that gave him and his party the assurance necessary to enter into peace negotiations, sign the Belfast Agreement, and contend for and win political office in the North. In recognition of William Flynn's achievements, the National Committee established the William J. Flynn Initiative for Peace Award in 1997. Among the recipients are George J. Mitchell, Marjorie Mowlam, Viola Drath, Hugh Carey, and Gerry Adams, M.P. Shortly after establishing its Northern Ireland project, the NCAFP launched its track I-¬Ω and track II project on U.S.-China relations and the question of Taiwan. The project gradually grew into the Forum on Asia-Pacific Security. The NCAFP, under this thematic umbrella, sponsored security talks with North Korea on nuclear issues and, more recently, security issues affecting U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea relations. The entire Forum on Asia-Pacific Security is largely conducted at track I-¬Ω and track II levels. Since its founding, the National Committee has focused its attention on significant geopolitical regions such as the Middle East and strategic partnerships such as Transatlantic Relations. More recently, as an outgrowth of those studies, the NCAFP established projects on the Caspian Sea Basin and U.S.-UN relations, as well as on Africa. While the Committee's scope has broadened, it remains anchored to its values: the preservation and strengthening of national security; supporting political, religious, and cultural pluralism; improving U.S. relations with its allies; advancing human rights; curbing nuclear proliferation and encouraging realistic arms-control agreements; and promoting an open global economy. Task forces Its long-term task forces bring together U.S. and foreign scholars, foreign-policy practitioners, and others to off-the-record and sometimes closed-door forums where adversaries can, over a period of years, air their views unencumbered by official rhetoric. Shorter- term task forces deal with immediate foreign policy challenges facing the U.S. =Meetings= The organization's Meetings Program offers members and guests the opportunity to share their thoughts on U.S. foreign policy with influential policymakers, diplomats, renowned scholars, and foreign policy specialists. Each year, the organization convenes a series of programs, including single speaker events, panels and round tables addressing immediate and long-term issues of national security. =Special initiatives= In May 2004, it launched its Forum on Northeast Asian Security. Projects chaired by Henry Kissinger and Paul Volcker include exploring the potential for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula; a Northeast Asian Security Forum, composed of the U.S., Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and North Korea; and breaking the impasse between China and Taiwan. Publications A distinguishing activity of the organization is the publication and dissemination of firm, reasoned positions designed to help formulate American foreign policy. When, after study and discussion, the organization or one of its task forces reaches a consensus on an aspect of foreign policy that affects American national interests, it makes that judgment known to the Administration, the U.S. Congress, the media and the general public. =American Foreign Policy Interests= A long-time component of the organization's publication series was its bimonthly journal, American Foreign Policy Interests. The journal presented authoritative and provocative articles on critical questions of foreign policy written by leading scholars and policy experts. It was discontinued in 2015. =Books and booklets= The organization publishes short booklets of policy reports and recommendations. Additionally, the organization publishes speeches and summaries of discussions that have been the hallmarks of its foreign policy briefings, lecture series, and award ceremonies. Awards The organization presents five awards: =Hans J. Morgenthau Award= The award was established in 1981 to commemorate Morgenthau's seminal contributions to the theory and the practice of American foreign policy. It is awarded to an individual whose intellectual attainments and/or practical contributions to U.S. foreign policy have been judged so exemplary in the tradition of Professor Morgenthau as to merit this singular award. Recipients include: * Angier Biddle Duke * Sol Linowitz * Henry Kissinger * Jeane Kirkpatrick * George P. Shultz * David Rockefeller * James Baker * Margaret Thatcher * Thomas R. Pickering * King Hussein of Jordan * Colin Powell * Richard N. Haass =George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service= The award was established in 1994 in honor of George F. Kennan, scholar, diplomat and statesman. It honors an American who has served the U.S. in an exemplary way and has made a seminal contribution to defining and illuminating the national interests of the U.S. Recipients include: * George F. Kennan * Cyrus Vance * Paul Volcker * Richard Holbrooke * Maurice R. Greenberg * John Negroponte * General David Petraeus * Raymond Kelly =William J. Flynn Initiative for Peace Award= The award was established 1997 as the Initiative for Peace Award in honor of William J. Flynn, NCAFP chairman, for his decisive leadership and daring diplomacy in spurring two cease-fires and promoting the peace process in Northern Ireland. Renamed in 2001, it is presented to an individual who has worked tirelessly to resolve a conflict that has affected the national interests of the U.S. Recipients include: * William J. Flynn * George J. Mitchell * Marjorie Mowlam * Viola Herms Drath * Hugh Carey * Gerry Adams =Global Business Leadership Award= The award honors a prominent business leader whose efforts have contributed to setting an unimpeachable standard for globally oriented corporate citizenship promoting the national interests of the U.S. Recipients include: * Paul E. Jacobs =21st Century Leader Award= The award was created to recognize the achievements of individuals under the age of 40 who display a serious commitment to furthering the U.S.'s strategic policy interests in accord with the principles of political realism. Through their professional or personal pursuits, they make important contributions to the international dialogue and demonstrate a promising future in the realm of U.S. foreign policy.

He was the president of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, an American non-partisan foreign policy think tank. He co-founded the organization in 1974 and served as its president from 1993 to 2015, and was the editor of its bimonthly journal, American Foreign Policy Interests.  Early life and education  Schwab was born in Latvia on November 25, 1931, to Arkady Schwab and Klara Schwab (n√©e Jacobson) of Latvian Jewish ancestry. The family later immigrated to the United States. He attended the City College of New York, graduating with a B.A. in 1954. He then attended Columbia University, where he earned a M.A. in 1955 and a Ph.D. in 1968.  Career  Schwab began his teaching career at Columbia in New York City in 1959. From 1960 to 1968, he was at The City College of New York and the Graduate Center, CUNY. From 1968 to 1972 he was an assistant Professor of history, an associate professor from 1973 to 1979, and professor from 1980 to 2000, and professor emeritus (City College and the Graduate Center), 2001‚Äìpresent. In 1974, Schwab was a co-founder of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy with the late Hans J. Morgenthau. He has edited the committee's bimonthly, American Foreign Policy Interests, since the inception of its publication in 1976. In 1984 he contributed a chapter titled A Decade of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy to a Festschrift in honor of Hans J. Morgenthau and the National Committee. Before assuming the presidency of the Committee in 1993, he was its senior vice president and vice president. Schwab has also lectured widely on his concept of The Open-Society Bloc at, among other institutions, the University of Freiburg in Germany and the Bundeswehrhochschule at Hamburg. He has also presented papers and actively participated at international gatherings in Tokyo; Paris (the Nobel Laureate conference at the Elys√©e Palace, 1988); Jerusalem; Washington, D.C.; and New York. In the fall of 2001 the National Committee received a private endowment designed to honor the work of Professor Schwab which led to the creation of the George D. Schwab Foreign Policy Briefings. Speakers at the briefings range from heads of state, foreign ministers, ambassadors, officials of international organizations, and other foreign policy practitioners and experts. They are held throughout the year to give members and guests the opportunity to extend and enhance their understanding of issues that affect the national interests of the United States. Schwab retired from teaching in 2000; he is currently professor emeritus of City College and the Graduate Center. He retired from the National Committee in 2016 and now holds the title of president emeritus.  Personal life  In 1965 he married Eleonora Storch and they had three children, Clarence Boris, Claude Arkady, and Solan Bernhard. Mrs. Schwab died in 1998.

Fullpower specializes in wireless technology, microelectromechanical systems, and nanotechnology. The company holds over 125 patents for its intellectual property, which it licenses to manufacturers. The company was founded in 2005 by entrepreneurs Philippe Kahn and Sonia Lee. History =2005-2009= Fullpower was founded in Santa Cruz, California in 2005 by entrepreneurs Philippe Kahn and Sonia Lee, who had previously founded and sold technology companies Starfish Software and LightSurf. The inspiration behind some of the key Fullpower technology came from Kahn's passion for sailing; he created prototype sleep trackers using biosensors that optimized 26-minute power naps to maximize sleep benefits and sail time. In 2008, the company launched its MotionX Platform tracking technology, which included licensing deals to include the technology on third party devices. Later in 2008, the company launched iOS gaming apps MotionX Poker and MotionX Dice, along with handheld GPS app MotionX-GPS, targeted to outdoor enthusiasts. In September 2009, the company released MotionX-GPS Drive for the iPhone, a door- to-door pedestrian and driving navigation application. The company later released customized versions of its navigation application for the iPad. =2010-2016= In September 2010, Nike released the Nike+ Running App (now called Nike+ Running) that tracks human motion using the accelerometer and GPS sensors of the iPhone and Android phones. MotionX provides the underlying motion sensing technology for the Nike+ Running Application, which was later named one of 2010's best apps of the year by the Wall Street Journal. At the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, JVC and Pioneer Corporation announced car stereo systems that integrate with the MotionX-GPS Drive application so that driving directions are shown on the in-car screen and audio verbal directions are heard over the car speakers. This was said to be the first time a commercially available iPhone navigation application used an after-market in- car screen as a display. In November 2011, Jawbone launched the UP band with ID design by Yves B√©har and integrated with the MotionX technology. In February 2012, the MotionX 24/7 application was announced for the Apple App Store, with functions for sleep analysis, heart rate monitoring, and activity monitoring. In 2015, Fullpower partnered with Swiss watch corporation Union Horlogere Holdings to form the joint venture Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT), and launched the MotionX Horological Smartwatch Open Platform for the Swiss watch industry. The initial partners were Frederique Constant, the Geneva-based luxury watch manufacturer of classical watches; Alpina, the Swiss Sports Watch manufacturer founded in 1883; and Mondaine, known for its SBB Swiss Railway watches. In November 2015, watchmaker Movado announced the release of the Movado Motion collection of fine Swiss made watches, using MMT's MotionX technology platform. =2017-present= In February 2017, Fullpower partnered with bedding product company Simmons to launch the Beautyrest Sleeptracker monitor, designed to monitor two individuals' sleep patterns. In June, Tomorrow Sleep also started selling Sleeptracker monitors powered by Fullpower technology. In August 2019, Fullpower announced a partnership with mattress manufacturer Tempur Sealy to make beds that analyze sleep and snoring patterns, and adjust to correct sleep problems. In January 2020, Fullpower partnered with opioid risk management company OPOS to develop an application to monitor the effects of opioids on patient sleep cycles. Products =MotionX= MotionX brand logo The MotionX Platform is a suite of coupled and integrated firmware, software and communication components for wearable wireless devices. The MotionX Platform is used by several wearable product brands, including Nike, Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT), Alpina, Frederique Constant, Mondaine, and Jawbone.

Simon Estes (born March 2, 1938) is an operatic bass-baritone of African-American descent who had a major international opera career beginning in the 1960s. He has sung at most of the world's major opera houses as well as in front of presidents, popes and internationally renowned figures and celebrities including Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Boris Yeltsin, Yasser Arafat, Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. Notably, he was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve widespread success and is viewed as part of a group of performers who were instrumental in helping to break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. Early life and education Estes was born in Centerville, Iowa, the son of Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes. His father was a coal-miner and his grandfather was a former slave who had been sold at auction for $500. Named for his father, Estes was called 'Billy' within his family circle to avoid confusion when addressing the two. One of five children, Estes has three sisters and a younger brother. His family was heavily involved in their local Baptist church, and his earliest musical experiences were had there. He remained active with church musical activities and participated in school music programs throughout his youth. In 1957 Estes entered the University of Iowa, originally with the intent of studying pre-med. He changed his major to psychology and then religion before finally deciding to switch to vocal music through the influence of faculty member Charles Kellis. At the time Estes had been singing in the university's \\"Old Gold Singers\\" (he was notably the group's first black singer) and his voice had grabbed Kellis's interest. Kellis became Estes's first voice teacher and it was he who introduced Estes to opera. After finishing his undergraduate studies, Estes pursued further education at the Juilliard School in 1964, a pursuit which was made possible through funds raised in Iowa. Career Like many African-American artists of his day, Estes decided to go to Europe where racial prejudice was not as much of a barrier as it was in the United States. In 1965 he made his professional opera debut as Ramfis in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida at the Deutsche Oper Berlin to a warm reception. The following year he scored a major success when he won a bronze medal at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Competition. The competition win led to an invitation from President Lyndon Johnson to perform at the White House in 1966 and several offers for engagements at major opera houses in Europe soon followed. Estes kept a very busy schedule performing in European opera houses during the late 1960s and the 1970s. He drew particular acclaim for performing leading roles in operas by Richard Wagner. He appeared at such houses as La Scala, Covent Garden, the Op√©ra National de Paris, the Liceu, the Hamburg State Opera, the Bavarian State Opera, the Vienna State Opera and the Zurich Opera among others. He also sang at several notable music festivals, including the Salzburg Festival and on Continental tours by the Glyndebourne Festival. In 1978 he notably became the first black male, African-American or otherwise, to sing a leading role at the prestigious Bayreuth Festival when he sang the lead role in Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. The performance was a personal triumph for him and he went on to sing at Bayreuth for the next six consecutive years. He returned to Bayreuth again in 1985 to sing the Dutchman again; a performance that was captured on video and is still considered one of the best recordings of that role. While Estes's career was thriving in the best European houses, he continued to be spurned by many of the major American houses during the 1970s. His debut with the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1971 was in the minor role of the Ghost of Nino in Semiramide, and his successive roles at that house were not any bigger. The Metropolitan Opera did not even attempt to engage him in the 1960s; in 1976 he sang a single tour performance of Bellini's Norma with the Met at Wolf Trap. More favorable to him was the San Francisco Opera (SFO) with whom he sang several good roles in 1967, including the 4 villains in The Tales of Hoffman and Carter Jones in the United States premiere of Gunther Schuller's The Visitation. He returned to the SFO several times during his career, singing Ramfis in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida (1972), Don Pedro in L'Africaine (1972), Raimondo in Lucia di Lammermoor (1972), the Dutchman in The Flying Dutchman (1979), Marke in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde (1980), Amonasro in Aida (1981), and Escamillo in Georges Bizet's Carmen (1981). In 1981 Estes was finally offered a contract to sing at the home theatre of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. He accepted, but at the time was cautioned by Leontyne Price, the first African-American to become a leading prima donna at the Met, about the difficult road ahead. Price, who suffered actual threats to her life when she first opened at the Met, explained, \\"Simon, it's going to be even more difficult for you. Because you are a black male, the discrimination will be greater. You have a beautiful voice; you are musical, intelligent, independent and handsome. With all of these ingredients, you are a threat. It will be more difficult for you than it was for me.\\" However, the Met audience and critics responded favourably to Simon's house debut on January 4, 1982 as Hermann in Wagner's Tannh√§user with Richard Cassilly in the title role and Leonie Rysanek as Elisabeth. Estes went on to sing in the next six consecutive seasons at the Met, portraying such roles as Amfortas in Wagner's Parsifal and Orest in Richard Strauss's Elektra. In 1985, he sang Porgy in the Met's first production of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. In 1986, he sang Wotan in the inauguration of the legendary Ring production at the Metropolitan Opera directed by Otto Schenk. He returned to the Met in 1990 to sing Porgy again and for the last time in 1999 to portray Amonasro to Sharon Sweet's Aida. Perhaps his greatest Met moment was singing the role of Amonasro to Price's Aida for her farewell opera performance which was telecast live on national television on January 3, 1985. He is a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron Humanitarian work More recently, Estes has turned his attention to the fight against HIV/AIDS. At the forefront of Artists for HIV/AIDS prevention and education, Estes leads a collective voice of artists, who through music and arts, seek to break down socio-economic barriers as well as the stigma associated with the disease. On July 9, 2010, he performed at the World Cup during the opening \\"Tribute to South Africa\\" at the FIFA Gala Concert in Johannesburg, South Africa. There he learned about the increasing problem of malaria in South Africa and decided also to get engaged in the fight against this illness. In 2013, the Simon Estes Foundation inaugurated a program called \\"Iowa Students Care,\\" to engage Iowa students in the cause of eliminating malaria in Africa by raising funds to provide treated bed nets for African children. Its \\"Eliminate Malaria Campaign\\" was engaged in partnership with the United Nations Foundation and its Nothing But Nets Campaign, and was endorsed the governor and lieutenant governor of the state of Iowa. Activities include selling a benefit CD called \\"Save the Children, Save their Lives\\", and an Iowa Students Care Christmas Concert to be held on December 15 in Ames, Iowa, which will also include the Des Moines Symphony led by Joseph Giunta. In 2017, Estes donated a public performance for a nonprofit organization, the Foundation for the Revival of Classical Culture, at Carnegie Hall in a June 29, 2017 event entitled \\"Tribute to Sylvia Olden Lee.\\" He played King Philip in scenes from the opera Don Carlos. Educator Estes is currently a visiting Professor of Music at the Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) Ankeny Campus. Before that, Estes was a professor of Music at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa where he gives voice lessons when he is in residence. He has performed in Wartburg's Christmas concert, Christmas With Wartburg, and has been known to go on domestic and international spring tours with Wartburg's concert choir. He is listed on the artist faculty of Boston University and he is also the F. Wendell Miller Distinguished Artist in Residence at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.Simon Estes . Iowa State University Department of Music and Theatre website. His many honorary degrees include a doctorate from Iowa State University, and he was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Iowa. Personal life In 1980, Estes married Yvonne Baer. They had three daughters, Jennifer, Lynne, and Tiffany. After 21 years, the couple divorced. Baer is now a consultant in Zurich. In 2001, Estes married Ovida Stong, a nurse who had cared for his mother in Iowa.

Forewing with a comparatively broad oblique white band from middle of costa to near apex of vein 1 above the tornal angle, narrowed posteriorly; beyond this an ill- defined narrow, somewhat more erect, pale dusky-white band from costa to dorsal margin, curving slightly round the tornal termination of the inner broader band; an inner and an outer slender abbreviated subterminal line extending in the female from vein 1 to vein 4, shorter in the male. Hindwing has a postdiscal sinuous, ill-defined, broad transverse band, paler than the ground colour, bordered on the inner and outer sides by very obscure lunular dull whitish lines, followed by two slender pure white subterminal broken lines that in interspaces 4 and 5 are bordered inwardly by large jet-black spots; these spots divided by a conspicuous Ferruginous line along vein 5; the cilia and apex of tail, and in some specimens the apex of wing and the costal margin, narrowly snow-white. Underside similar, with similar markings, but the ground colour much paler, especially on the basal halves of the wings, the markings more clearly defined and broader; on the hindwing the white lines bordering the post-discal broad band have a purplish tinge, and in interspace 1 there are two inner obscure subterminal triangular black spots. Antennae brown, ringed with white; head, thorax and abdomen pale brown; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen more or less whitish.

Sarn Helen refers to several stretches of Roman road in Wales. The route, which follows a meandering course through central Wales, connects Aberconwy in the north with Carmarthen in the west. Despite its length, academic debate continues as to the precise course of the Roman road. Many sections are now used by the modern road network while other parts are still traceable. However, there are sizeable stretches that have been lost and are unidentifiable. The route is named after Saint Elen of Caernarfon, a Celtic saint, whose story is told in The Dream of Macsen Wledig, part of the Mabinogion. She is said to have ordered the construction of roads in Wales during the late 4th century. Route =Aberconwy‚ÄìCarmarthen= In the north the route is believed to follow the western bank of the river Conwy from Canovium, a fort at Caerhun, passing through Trefriw, then leading on to Betws-y-Coed, with a branch leading to Caer Llugwy near Capel Curig. The route then passed through Dolwyddelan, running up the Cwm Penamnen valley and past the higher parts of Cwm Penmachno. The route then leads on past Llan Ffestiniog to the Roman fort of Tomen y Mur, near Trawsfynydd before continuing south towards Dolgellau. South of Dolgellau the route passes over Waen Llefenni into Cwm yr Hengae to Aberllefenni. Part of the narrow-gauge Corris Railway between Aberllefenni and Maespoeth Junction may run along the line of the Sarn.Corris Railway Society Journal 2002 At Esgairgeiliog, the minor road running along the east bank of the Afon Dulas is thought to be probably Roman although the quoted source does not link it to the Sarn and it is more likely that the Sarn remained on the west bank of the Dulas between Corris and Ffridd Gate.Corris Railway Society Journal 2002 The Sarn probably crossed the Dyfi by a ford or ferry near the Cefn Caer Roman fort at Pennal. In Ceredigion Sarn Helen runs as part of a B-road in Bronant, and six miles south there is a long stretch through the hamlet of Stag's Head. It passes down to Llanio, where there was a small Roman fort named Bremia, and crosses over to Dolaucothi before reaching Llandovery. The route survives as a minor road here, although severely affected by potholes where it crosses the mountains. =Neath‚ÄìBrecon= A further section of Roman road leading north- eastwards from Neath (') to Banwen at the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park is also known as Sarn Helen. It continues north-eastwards through the park to the north-west of Ystradfellte, beneath Fan Frynych, and then across Mynydd Illtud en route to the Roman fort of y Gaer ('). Outdoor pursuits =Cycle route= A long-distance mountain bike route named the Sarn Helen Trail follows parts of the road's course.Sarn Helen Trail (MBRUK website) The trail, which was devised in 1996, runs between Conwy on the North Wales coast and Worms Head on the Gower Peninsula. =Fell running= The road gives its name to the annual Sarn Helen Hill Race that starts and finishes in Lampeter in mid Wales. The multi-terrain race, which was founded in 1980, takes place in May each year. It claims to combine \\"the speed of road racing with the rigours of cross country and fell running over a challenging picturesque course\\". In popular culture \\"Sarn Helen\\" is the title of a song by Welsh band Super Furry Animals, named after the Roman road, appearing on their Welsh language album Mwng. \\"Sarn Helen\\" is also the title of a 1997 sequence of poems by English poet John Wilkinson, named after the Roman road.
