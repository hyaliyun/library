In Warsaw he ran into Polish hockey players, associated with the club AZS Warszawa, who asked him to join their team after he explained he had played hockey at Harvard. With Adamowski on the team, AZS Warszawa five times in a row won the Polish championship (1927, 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931). Between 1926 and 1931 he was the center of the Polish national team and was considered to be one of the most technically skilled hockey players in Europe. He was chosen as the fourth most popular athlete in Poland in 1927 (and 7th in 1929). In 1926 Adamowski took part in the European Hockey Championship in Davos, as part of the first- ever international appearance of the Polish ice hockey team. Adamowski played in the European Championships six times in all (1926, 1927, 1929-silver medal, 1930, 1931-silver medal, and 1933).

Trioza cockerelli n. sp., a novelty from North America, being also of economic importance. Acta societatis entomologicae Bohemiae, 6:102-108 also known as the potato psyllid, is a species of psyllid native to southern North America. Its range extends from Central America north to the American Pacific Northwest and parts of Manitoba. It is restricted to the western part of the continent. As its name suggests, it is commonly found on potato and tomato crops, but has a species range that encompasses over 40 species of solanaceous plants and as many as 20 genera. Breeding hosts are generally recognised as being restricted primarily to Solanaceae, including important crop and common weed species, and a few species of Convolvulaceae, including bindweed and sweet potato. On some plants, especially potato, feeding of the nymphs causes a condition called psyllid yellows, presumed to be the result of a toxin. Both nymphs and adults can transmit the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter. Zebra chip is a recently diagnosed disease of potatoes associated with psyllid infestation and caused by species of the gram-negative bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter. The tubers frequently have discolouration which becomes more clear during frying of chips. This disease causes very significant losses to farmers when it occurs as the potatoes are not suitable for making into chips or fries. The pest has caused significant loss in potato yields during periods of major population increase. Maximum potato yield loss appears to be related to infestations occurring early in the growing season, or on crops with a significant leaf canopy by summer. The psyllids are not heat tolerant and it is thought they survive summer temperatures in crops with sufficient leaf canopy through summer to offer shade. The nymphs are very small and inconspicuous, feeding on the underside of leaves. Both nymphs and adults feed in the phloem.

Norsk Hydro Oil and Gas =Oseberg= Enger was selected to be asset manager for the giant Oseberg field in the North Sea which at the time was the largest offshore project in the world. Oseberg was the first operatorship of Norsk Hydro. The project was completed within time and on budget. At its peak the production was 500,000 barrels per day.< This project was innovative in the sense that it used gas injection from Troll.

The Company was first known as Bodlets (the junior section to Bath Operatic and Dramatic Society) and changed its name to Zenith Youth Theatre Company in 2003. Its first major production was in 1964 at the Grand Pump Room, Bath. The company was formed by Charles Davies and Victor Smith, members of Bath Operatic and Dramatic Society, in 1963 to encourage a younger generation to participate in amateur dramatics. Members were then encouraged to move on to the senior society once old enough. Its profile grew and by the late 1970s had a strong reputation for presenting musical theatre. It changed its name to Zenith Youth Theatre Company in 2003. The first production under the new name was Some Like It Hot. In November 2013 Lady Gass, the Lord Lieutenant of Somerset, presented the group with the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service at the Guildhall, Bath.

The symptoms are a marked yellowing of the leaves, an upright appearance to the leaves, with severe cases resulting in early death of the plant. Tuber initiation and growth is affected. Many small tubers are formed, frequently misshaped. In some cases, the tubers seem to have lost sprouting inhibition and have begun sprouting before harvest. At later stages, the tubers sprout weakly, if at all. It is thought that a toxin produced by the nymph stage of the psyllid causes these symptoms. If pest control occurs at an early stage of the disease, the plants appear to be able to recover. A very similar disease has been described in tomatoes. In addition to the foliar symptoms, mature fruit is very much smaller, tends to have a pointy end, and frequently they occur in larger clusters of fruit than normal. In severe cases, the yellowing progresses to plant death. In addition to psyllid feeding, a new species of bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' has been associated with this disease. Capsicum crops show a similar fruit effect, but generally with no, or very little, foliar symptom. A summary of symptoms from plants in New Zealand with photos of tomato and capsicum plants: * Symptoms in tomato plants: Include leaf curling and yellowing stunting of the plant, fruit occasionally misshapen with a strawberry like appearance. The leaf axial or stalk may also become very long and the fruit development may be uneven. * Symptoms in capsicum plants: Include pale green or yellow leaves with spiky tips. Leaves may be misshapen. Leaf stalks may be misshapen, leaf stalks appear short, flowers may drop prematurely and parts of the plant may die back. Symptoms may vary in severity between varieties. * Symptoms in potato tops can include these being smaller than normal, yellowing and the tops can develop a scorched appearance before premature collapse. This same Liberibacter has recently been found in potatoes in New Zealand Candidatus Liberibacter spp bacterium detected in new host and in the US.Candidatus Liberibacter spp. as putative causal agent of Zebra Chip of potatoes The potato disorder/disease \\"Zebra chip\\" is related in that 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' has been reported from Zebra Chip potatoes in both Texas and New Zealand.

Because both these groups disappear abruptly at the end of the Ediacaran period, , their disappearance cannot simply represent the closure of a preservational window, as had previously been suspected. Post-Ediacaran survivors The fossil record of the earliest Cambrian, just after the Ediacaran period, shows a sudden increase in burrowing activity and diversity. However, the Cambrian explosion of animals that gave rise to body fossils did not happen instantaneously. This implies that the \\"explosion\\" did not represent animals \\"replacing\\" the incumbent organisms, and pushing them gradually to extinction; rather, the data are more consistent with a radiation of animals to fill in vacant niches, left empty as an extinction cleared out the pre-existing fauna. The theory that all Ediacarans became extinct at the start of the Cambrian is disproven if any post-Ediacaran survivors are found. Organisms from the lower Cambrian, such as Thaumaptilon, were once thought to be Ediacarans, but this hypothesis no longer has many adherents. One possible Ediacaran survivor whose status is still open to scrutiny is Ediacaria booleyi, a purported holdfast structure known from the upper Cambrian. If this does turn out to be a true Ediacaran, the biota cannot have disappeared completely. Disbelievers have claimed that the fossils don't actually have a biological origin, which doesn't seem to be the case‚Äîevidence is mounting to suggest that it is an organism (or at least of biological origin, perhaps a microbial colony),See Ediacaria just not one that is related to the Ediacara biota. Some organisms clearly survived the extinction since life on Earth has continued. However, very few organisms are known from both sides of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. One such organism is the agglutinated foramanifera Platysolenites. Swartpuntia is one well known late Ediacaran vendobiont, which survived into the earliest Cambrian. Cambrian Erytholus is a similar sandstone cast to Ediacaran Ventogyrus. Ordovician and Silurian Rutgersella and Devonian Protonympha have been interpreted as surviving vendobionts, comparable with Ediacaran Dickinsonia and Spriggina, respectively. Geochemical evidence A negative excursion‚Äîa geochemical signal often associated with mass extinctions‚Äîis observed at the end of the Ediacaran period. Sedimentary evidence This period is reflected in the geological record by an increase in black shale deposition, representing global anoxia. This may be related to global changes in oceanic circulation and may have been the worst marine anoxic event of the last 550 million years.

IFA members serve farmers everywhere as they meet the world's growing food, feed, fibre and bioenergy needs in a sustainable manner. IFA is based in Paris, France, has 525 members in 85 countries. About half of the membership is based in developing countries. IFA member companies represent all activities related to the production, trade, transport and distribution of every type of fertilizer, their raw materials and intermediates. IFA's membership also includes organizations involved in construction, engineering, consulting, agronomic research and training. IFA's current President is Rakesh Kapur of Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) . The global fertilizer industry produces some 170 million tonnes of fertilizer nutrients annually. These are used in every corner of the globe to support agricultural production. There is no substitute for the nutrients absorbed by crops. As a major source of these, fertilizers therefore represent an essential ingredient in the drive towards sustainable agriculture and world food security. IFA was founded in 1927 in London as the International Superphosphate Manufacturers Association.  IFA's Mission  The mission of the International Fertilizer Industry Association is to be the voice and the ear of the global fertilizer industry as it provides the crop nutrients to allow farmers everywhere to meet the world's growing food, feed, fibre and bioenergy needs in a sustainable manner. The purpose of IFA is to serve its members, policy makers, farmers, the scientific community and the interests of the general public by: *Actively promoting the efficient and responsible production and use of plant nutrients to maintain and increase agricultural production worldwide in a sustainable manner; *Influencing the formation of public policy relevant to crop nutrition and soil fertility management; *Improving the operating environment of the fertilizer industry in the spirit of free enterprise and fair trade; *Collecting, compiling and disseminating statistics and other information relevant to the fertilizer industry, and providing a platform for the discussion of all aspects of the production, distribution and consumption of fertilizers, their intermediates and raw materials. *Recognizing that crop nutrition is just one element of sustainable agriculture and rural development, IFA and its members seek to work with other stakeholders throughout the agricultural value chain to identify and implement holistic, integrated ways to meet the world's food, feed, fibre and bioenergy needs.  International consultation  IFA has consultative status with various agencies of the United Nations (UN), including: *Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), *International Maritime Organization (IMO), *United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), *United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and *United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

Background After CMB's heyday in the 1960s and 70s, its service quality started to deteriorate in the 1980s, with service delays and aging vehicles. On 30 November 1989, CMB staff went on a strike due to problems on retirement pay. CMB services were completely suspended, and traffic on Hong Kong Island ran into chaos. The most severe situation occurred in Southern District, which had no MTR service, to an extent that even police vehicles were mobilized to provide transport services. Citybus operated temporary routes to deal with the situation. The Government decided to rearrange bus services on the Island. Citybus had set its sights on services 12A and 17 that CMB has already withdrawn. It considers that residents residing in MacDonald Road, are richer and needed high-quality bus services. Upon obtaining the consent from the government, Citybus has announced in September 1989 that it intends to re-operate. In terms of that, after the strike, Citybus will formally apply to the government. In 1990, Citybus applied to start three non-franchised routes, namely 37R, 90R and 97R, all serving between Southern District to Admiralty. In March the same year, Citybus applied to operate the route 12A which CMB had previously requested to be cancelled due to low patronage. The application was approved, and services by Citybus commenced in September 1991 with air-conditioned Leyland Olympian double deckers. Other bids such as Argos Bus, Coornet Bus and Hong Kong Buses bid for the tender, together with Kowloon Motor Bus, eventually changing the mind and waive off the bidding. Later, seeing no improvement in CMB's services, the Government decided to re-tender 26 of CMB's routes to another company. Two companies applied, namely Citybus and Stagecoach. Since Stagecoach had no experience on operating routes in Hong Kong, Citybus won the tender. The routes were operated by Citybus in effective from 1 September 1993. Routes The routes included numbers 1, 1M, 5, 5A, 5B, 6, 6A, 10X, 12, 12M, 48, 61, 61M, 70, 70M, 72, 72A, 72B, 75, 76, 90, 92, 96, 97, 97A, 98, 107 and 170. Aftermath =Further route annexations= Significant service improvements were observed on the annexed routes, while CMB's service quality remained unsatisfactory. On 1 September 1995 the Government annexed a further 14 routes to Citybus, namely routes 7, 11, 37, 40, 40M, 71, 73, 85, 99, 511, 592, 260, 103 and 182. In 1997 CMB gave up four routes which were taken over by Citybus immediately: 45 and 47 became 40P and 47A on 3 March, 41 became 41A on 21 April 1997, and 3 became 3B on 2 June 1997. =The demise of CMB= Even with the previous route annexations, CMB still declined to improve its services. When the Government decided to implement the Octopus card system in 1997 for public transport, CMB rejected to follow. Furthermore, it failed to deliver proposals that year for franchise renewal due in 1998. On 17 February 1998, the Executive Council discontinued CMB's franchise, which would expire on 31 August 1998. 12 routes were directly handed over to Citybus, and one to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB). 11 routes were scheduled for cancellation with the franchise expiry. The remaining 88 routes were opened up for tender. CMB, KMB and Citybus joined in the tender; however it happened to be New World First Bus (NWFB), a completely new bus operator in Hong Kong formed by a joint venture between New World Development and FirstGroup, which won the tender in the end. At midnight on 1 September 1998 CMB ceased to operate bus services with the expiry of its tender, and the routes were taken over by NWFB. The cancelled routes include: 10A, 11A, 15M, 15X, 38A, 79, 337, 392, 504, A20 and N38A.

Frontiersman He proved unsuccessful as a prospector, turning to trapping and then briefly policing, serving as constable in Wild Horse Creek, British Columbia (now gone). In 1865, he moved on, to Waterton Lakes , being wounded by a Blackfoot on his way to Fort Garry (now Winnipeg), where he settled and became a whisky trader. Subsequent to that, he worked briefly for a company delivering mail to the United States Army until 1874, during which time he was captured and nearly killed by Sitting Bull in 1869. After a quarrel (and obligatory gunfight) at Fort Benton, Montana, with \\"celebrated hunter\\" Louis Ell, in which Ell was killed, and subsequent trial and acquittal by a territorial jury, Brown returned to his beloved Kootenay, where he settled, building a reputation as a guide and packer. Always arguing vigorously for the region's preservation, after the Kootenay Forest Reserve was established in 1895, Brown became a fishery officer and in 1910, a forest ranger. He lived to see the reserve expanded into Waterton Lakes National Park, which became contiguous with Glacier National Park in Montana, in 1914.

Popularly known as Dorothea of Courland after her marriage to Peter von Biron, the last Duke of Courland, she hosted an aristocratic salon in Berlin and performed various diplomatic duties on behalf of her estranged husband. Biography Anna Charlotte Dorothea was born at Me≈æotne, now Latvia, to Johann Friedrich von Medem, a Graf from the old Courland nobility, general-poruchik of the Russian Empire, and (as of 1779) Reichsgraf of the Holy Roman Empire; and his second wife, Louise Charlotte von Manteuffel. Her father, a descendant of Konrad von Mandern, was himself awarded the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky in 1774 for his help in preparing the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca. He owned many estates in Courland, including Elley and Alt-Autz. Her elder half sister from her father's previous marriage was the poet Elisa von der Recke. Her younger brother was Russian diplomat Christoph Johann von Medem, who built Villa Medem in Mitau (now Jelgava). Wilhelmine and Pauline. =Duchess of Courland= On 6 November 1779, eighteen-year-old Dorothea became the third wife of the 55-year-old, childless Duke Peter von Biron, son of the famous Ernst Johann von Biron. The couple had six children, two of whom died in infancy. The four surviving children were all daughters; however, the youngest one, Dorothea, was probably illegitimate, although recognized by the Duke. Dorothea was welcomed into the highest social circles thanks to her new status as duchess as well as her beauty. Because her husband was preoccupied with political difficulties at home involving his overlord the King of Poland and the Courland nobility, he frequently sent her on diplomatic missions to Warsaw, lasting months at a time, and to Berlin, Karlovy Vary, and Saint Petersburg for shorter periods. During these long absences Dorothea became alienated from her husband and had numerous love affairs with other men, including Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, Talleyrand, and the Polish nobleman, Count Alexander Benedykt Batowski, who allegedly fathered her fourth daughter, born in 1793. After the year she gave birth to her illegitimate daughter, also named Dorothea (whom her husband nevertheless acknowledged as his own), the Duchess moved permanently to the Palais Kurland in Berlin, where she held an aristocratic salon. =Later life= In 1794 she acquired the Gutsherrschaft L√∂bichau in Altenburgischen and spent her summers at the newly built Schloss there. Inviting poets, philosophers, relatives and friends to L√∂bichau, it became known as the Musenhof der Herzogin von Kurland. Her sister Elisa von der Recke, who would later be linked with Christoph August Tiedge, came to L√∂bichau to live and Tsar Alexander I of Russia, Frederick William III of Prussia, Napoleon I of France, Talleyrand, Metternich, Goethe, Schiller and other personalities of the time were the duchess's personal friends. In 1801, she received a proposal from Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden. Upon her youngest daughter Dorothea's marriage to Talleyrand's nephew, Edmond de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, in 1809, the duchess moved to Paris, having an intense relationship with Talleyrand and influenced him to turn against Napoleon. In 1814 she traveled to the Congress of Vienna to confront him about his alleged love affair with her daughter Dorothea. A few years after her death at L√∂bichau in 1821, the Duchess' body was moved from her place of death to the family vault at Sagan where her husband was buried in 1800.

Based in Los Angeles, he is known for a cinematic style of photography with a luxury aesthetic and vibrant use of colour.  Early life  Born in Dublin, Kelly began life as a photographer straight from school, covering news stories for local newspapers. His early work attracted the attention of major publishers and, at the age of twenty, he became Independent Newspapers youngest ever press photographer. Assignments to cover conflicts in Rwanda and Afghanistan for Independent Newspapers and, later, News International would shape Kelly's future approach to photography as a medium of storytelling. In 1996, his photo of a kiss between musicians Bono and Liam Gallagher won him global exposure and prompted a change in career. After his next Afghanistan trip, Kelly left the newspaper world to focus on his lifelong passions - fine art and fashion.  Career  Kelly left Dublin for Los Angeles - \\"a city of pure visual stimulation\\" - to handle growing demand for his work in the US. By now he was honing his distinctive style in the pages of prestige publications like Vanity Fair, Vogue Paris, GQ, L'Officiel and Cosmopolitan'. In 2013, he was commissioned by Playboy Magazine to deliver a series of iconic covers that would revitalise the brand. It was during this period that Kelly began to create the elaborate and extravagant set pieces that are now a signature of his work, producing daring images that blurred the boundaries of art and fashion. By 2015, having achieved international renown for his commercial work, the time had come to distil two decades of creativity into his first limited edition fine art collections. Since the successful launch of his solo career, his credo of \\"expression without limits\\" has fuelled his evolution as a collectible fine artist with global appeal. = Popular appeal = Kelly has been described as ‚Äúirreverent and provocative‚ÄùGQ Espa√±a, Edition 134, June 2008, P.26, \\"spontaneous and hyper-energetic‚Äù.Nathalie Cattaruzza, 2008. PHOTO magazine, Edition 447, March 2008, P.58 PHOTO magazine said his work \\"plays with humour and provocation\\" and that \\"his flashy style has conquered the world of fashion\\".Julie Hamaide, 2009. PHOTO magazine, Edition 461, July/August 2009, P.68 Paul Solomons, Creative Director of British GQ and GQ Style magazine, described him saying ‚Äú(Kelly) has carved out a distinctive style in an age where everyone seems to believe they can be photographers. He brings the pages of every publication he shoots for to life. He is a brave photographer not afraid to push directors and the talent. To say that Tony Kelly is one of a kind is an understatement.‚Äù In the words of Marco Finazzi, Art Director of Vanity Fair, ‚ÄúWhen you need colour, irony and humor, he is the first name that comes to mind. Think big, think Tony Kelly!‚Äù  Fine art  Kelly's artworks amplify the visual language that he honed as a photographer for luxury publications. Predominantly shot in bright sunlight, they are instantly recognisable by their dynamic crops, saturated colours and striking contrast. Guided by his philosophy that original art can only be produced by taking risks, Kelly purposely seeks to defy boundaries, stopping at nothing to bring his creative ideas to life. Meticulously styled and rehearsed, his work revels in the excess of aspiration, representing it with wit and imagination in bold and memorable images. Now established as a collectible artist, Kelly has exhibited in cities across the US and Europe. In November 2019, he unveiled his new collection at Preiss Fine Arts, Vienna in an exhibition entitled \\"A Colorful Mind\\". The new collection spans eleven pieces, shot in locations ranging from Hollywood and Miami Beach to the ski slopes of Val d'Isere. Kelly takes his subversion of iconography to new heights to create a striking series of fine art prints.  Commercial work  Kelly's unique style of fine art photography and fluency in the visual language of advertising continues to attract commissions from major luxury brands and expose his work to wider audiences. Most recently, his team traveled to Hawaii to shoot the Spectacles campaign for Snap Inc. Other notable clients include Skyy Vodka (for their 25th anniversary campaign Kelly starred in one of his own images), Estee Lauder, BMW, Ilmakiage and Steve Madden. Kelly's ability to create a smile in the mind gives his work universal resonance, whether it is displayed in private collections or on public billboards from Times Square to Sunset Boulevard.  Books  In 2014, Kelly released his first self-published coffee table book titled Tony's Toys. Kelly chose the self-publishing route to sidestep the constraints of commercial publishing, allowing him to reflect his signature level of extravagance ‚Äì right down to the hand stitched pages. The book is limited to a release of 900 copies + 100 special edition copies. Described by Blink magazine as \\"ground breaking for both its innovative layout, dimensions and the scale of the images presented, this limited edition piece cements Kelly's position as one of the most original and provocative photographers of our time\\".Blink Magazine, Issue 39, January 2015 His second book \\"Taken! Entertaining Nudes by Tony Kelly\\" was released in September 2016 by teNeues and distributed worldwide. Maxim hailed it as \\"the most entertaining photo book you'll ever see\\", a \\"showcase of some of his strongest - and sexiest - work to date\\". Maxim Magazine, September 2016  Awards  In 2017 Kelly won Clio Awards recognition for his eye-catching print campaign to advertise the US TV series Claws. His growing stature as an international image maker won him the Monaco Influencer Awards (Visual Arts category) in 2019.

It was written by Vern (no last name). It is the first in-depth study to be published on the complete creative output of Steven Seagal. The book makes a careful examination of every Steven Seagal film from 1988's Above the Law to 2008's Pistol Whipped, as well as providing reviews of some of Seagal's other output: his music, his appearances in commercials, and even his energy drink. In 2012, an updated edition of the book was published, incorporating reviews from the intervening years including Seagal's work on the reality TV show Steven Seagal: Lawman. The book makes the argument that certain specific themes and motifs remain present throughout Seagal's filmography, laying the groundwork for an examination of the films using the auteur theory. Since auteur theory usually cites the film director as the source of a film's particular vision, Vern argues that Seagal's filmography represents an example of what he describes as the \\"badass auteur\\": typically an action star whose persona and interests recur throughout their filmography, regardless of director or other creative collaborators. Vern describes themes of government corruption (particularly involving the CIA), environmentalism, and adoption of foreign cultures as being examples of recurrent motifs in Seagal's films, among a variety of others. The first edition also breaks Seagal's career into four chronological \\"eras\\", marked by specific differences in style and content; the 2012 updated edition adds a fifth era. These chronological \\"eras\\" describe different phases of Seagal's career, and include the \\"Golden Era\\" (1988-1991), the period of Seagal's first successes, the \\"Silver Era\\" (1992-1997), during which Seagal saw the peak of his fame and made high-profile blockbusters, a \\"Transitional Period\\" (1998-2002) during which he made lower-profile or ensemble films, a lengthy \\"direct-to-video\\" period (his most prolific to date, 2003-2008) and, in the 2012 updated addition, a \\"Chief Seagal\\" period (2009‚ÄìPresent) during which Seagal moved into television and began reflecting elements of his Steven Seagal:Lawman persona in his films The book is notable for generally avoiding discussion of Seagal's personal life or career, and instead focusing almost exclusively on his artistic output. Biographical details (for instance, his legal issues with producer Julius R. Nasso) appear only in the context of discussing their possible impact on his artistic choices.

The plan was given outline government approval in July 2009. The plan would need to gain full planning permission before construction commenced. A number of organisations are involved in the development. A joint venture company called ECO-BOS has been set up by Imerys, and Orascom, with assistance from the Eden Project. This company will prepare the planning application and build the development if granted. Cornwall Council will lead on some part of the project. Background The plan was provisionally termed Imerys China Clay Community, in 2008 it was shortlisted by the UK's Department for Communities and Local Government as one of the 10 eco-towns proposed for construction in the UK. Under the company's plans, 5,000 eco-homes would be built on former china clay quarries and other sites owned by Imerys over a 20-year period. The sites are: *Baal & West Carclaze near the villages of Penwithick and Stenalees. The plan includes 1,800-2,500 homes, a 31-acre lake and eight hectares of employment land. *Par Docks, near to Par: a new marina with facilities for local fishing boats, 500-700 homes, and a biomass energy centre. *Blackpool, close to the villages of Trewoon, High Street and Lanjeth: 2,100 and 2,500 homes, a new railway station, new schools, a lake and eco- parkland. *Goonbarrow on the edge of the village of Bugle: 450-550 homes. *Drinnick & Nanpean on the edge of the village of Nanpean: 150-300 homes. A pilot project consisting of 48 homes, community and employment buildings is planned for the Baal & West Carclaze site. The homes will be built with high level of energy efficiency including some with a zero-carbon rating. The plan includes several renewable energy sources such as geo-thermal, solar, biomass generation, wind farms, water source heating/cooling and rainwater harvesting. Matthew Taylor, former local MP, was appointed as an independent chair of a board set up to develop the project. In December 2012, the developers of the St Austell eco-town announced that plans had been put on hold indefinitely, blaming the depressed economic situation for their decision. In September 2013, it was announced that Cornwall Council had accepted a grant of more than ¬£1.5million from Central Government to push for the revival of the project in the West Carclaze area along the A391 from the Carclaze to the edges of Stenalees and Penwithick. The revised plans, include 1,500 homes, a primary school, a technology park, solar farms and recreational facilities. A community consultation was held in May and June 2014, this resulted in several changes to the master plan. A planning application which is due to be submitted in December 2014. The project was included in a list of fourteen garden villages announced by the Government in January 2017. Reception The plan has received some local opposition. The \\"No Ecotown\\" group has fears that few of the homes will be affordable as well as increased traffic congestion, lack of employment opportunities, swamping of local villages and damage to wildlife habitats. Project progress The project received a ¬£9 million share of a ¬£60 million government handout for its initiation. *Prince Charles House, designed by PRP Architects, an affordable housing eco-development of 31 flats for older people in St Austell was completed in April 2012 *78 properties in Penwithick received energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. Major improvements to the A391 were completed in June 2016, these include a new 1.6km section and two new bridges. Funding was received from the European Regional Development Fund.

It is a variant of the CPA (cost per action) model, where the advertiser pays the publisher and/or website owner in proportion to the number of actions committed by the readers or visitors to the website.Jim Taylor, et al. \\"Engaging Online Consumers with an Interactive Cost-Per-Action Advertising Model.\\" Journal of Internet Commerce 8.3/4 (2009): 288-308. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 21 Jan. 2011. In many cases, it is impractical to track all the sales generated by an advertisement. However, it is more easily tracked for full online transactions such as selling songs directly on the internet. Unique identifiers, which can be stored in cookies or included in the URL, are used to track the movement of the prospective buyer to ensure that all such sales are attributed to the advertisement in question. Telephone Call Tracking Pay-per-Sale Some companies handle transactions \\"offline,\\" meaning sales driven by online traffic are closed via inbound telephone calls or in person rather than online. This model bridges the gap between online and offline platforms. In these cases, a cookie-based rotating system of telephone numbers can be used to accurately trace a phone call to the source online visitor. This way, a phone call that converts into business can be traced to the keyword search term that drove the phone call. As a result, bids on the source traffic can be appropriately adjusted and managed. Usually, it is the advertiser that determines what constitutes a valid lead or a qualified call to be paid. Pay-per-Sale Search Engine Marketing Pay-per- Sale Search Engine Marketing is a variant of pay-per-sale, whereby the traffic source is largely search engine traffic such as that from Google's AdWords \\"pay-per-click\\" system. The business model means that merchants no longer bear the cost of \\"pay-per-click\\"; instead, the \\"pay-per-sale\\" provider takes on the risk of conversion. CPS belongs to the larger family of CPA, which is different from Cost Per Impression in which advertisers pay every time their advertisement is displayed, irrespective of whether the display created any action on the part of reader or visitor to the website or not. Affiliate Networks in Online Marketing Affiliate Networks usually offer the \\"pay-per- sale\\" business model and have done so since inception. These are firms that manage affiliates for their clients and often work with websites that accept advertisements. The industry has four core players: the merchant (also known as retailer or brand), the network, the publisher (also known as 'the affiliate'), and the customer. Typically, affiliate networks such as ValueClick or Commission Junction will connect merchants (advertisers) with publishers, or owners of sites, which can send traffic to the merchants' sites in exchange for a bounty, or commission for each sale delivered.McCooey, Eileen. \\"Affiliate Nation.\\" MediaWeek 10.15 (2000): 116. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 21 Jan. 2011 However, there is typically an upfront set- up fee, as well as monthly minimum charges for the advertiser, in addition to relatively stringent requirements around entry into the network to begin with. An individual or an organization could also set up his or its own affiliate network. This could address one of the risks of this model, which is less commitment on the part of the affiliates.

The band's last line-up consisted of Charlie Fink (vocals, guitar), Tom Hobden (violin/keyboards), Matt \\"Urby Whale\\" Owens (bass guitar), Fred Abbott (guitar/keys) and Michael Petulla (drums). Doug Fink (drums), the brother of lead singer Charlie, and Laura Marling (backing vocals) were also past members of the band. The band have played at a number of notable venues, including a sold-out show at The Royal Albert Hall and festivals such as Coachella, Lollapalooza, Green Man and Glastonbury as well as headlining Wilderness Festival in 2013. They also toured with Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend and Phoenix, and played on shows such as Late Show with David Letterman as well as Later... with Jools Holland, The Graham Norton Show and The Andrew Marr Show. History =Early years and Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down (2006‚Äì2008)= The band released their debut album, entitled Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down, on 11 August 2008. The album peaked at Number 5 on the official UK Albums Chart and has received mostly positive reviews.Elan, Priya (2008) \\"Noah and the Whale ‚Äì Peaceful, The World Lays Me Down\\" (review), The Times, 2 August 2008 The album featured a brass accompaniment, provided by Jon Carvell (trombone) and Sam Kinrade (trumpet). The band's original line-up also included Laura Marling, who featured as backing vocals on the first album and performed with the band as much as her touring schedule allowed. In mid-2008, Marling left the band several months after the album's release. However, she continued to collaborate with band member Tom Hobden, who played fiddle on her albums I Speak Because I Can and Short Movie After the departure of Marling, Emmy the Great sang with the band for a short period of time, as well as Lillie Flynn (sister of singer Johnny Flynn) and Rebecca Taylor of Slow Club filling the role of female vocalist during tours. The band also released a 'punk' EP at the time called Noah and the Whale presents: The A Sides featuring new songs and a reworking of \\"Hold My Hand As I'm Lowered\\" from the band's debut album. Vinyl copies of the EP are still available on the Young And Lost Club website. =The First Days of Spring (2009)= From January 2009 onwards, the band started work on their second full-length LP, entitled The First Days of Spring. Along with the album release, Charlie Fink wrote and directed a film that runs the entire length of the album, also entitled The First Days of Spring. Fink decided not to feature female backing vocals on their second LP due to the painful but inspiring departure of Laura Marling to pursue a solo career. Her separation from the band did however inspire a change from their traditional sound, signaling a new direction in the band's music and lyrics. The album was released on 31 August 2009, a little over a year after their debut. Three days prior to the release Doug Fink, brother of lead singer Charlie, announced he would be leaving the band to pursue a career in medicine. At the same time Fred Abbott joined the band on second guitar/piano and Doug was temporarily replaced by former Pull Tiger Tail drummer Jack Hamson. \\"The First Days of Spring\\" was the first single release from the album and was made available for download from the band's website, while the first official single entitled \\"Blue Skies\\" was released on 24 August 2009 after the song received its first airplay on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 evening show earlier in the summer. The band then embarked on an extensive tour which included playing at the 2009 Reading and Leeds Festivals on the main stage, as well as a variety of other venues. On 30 September 2009, BBC News reported that the band's equipment, including guitars, bass instruments and their drum kit, were stolen from a car park near the Club Academy in Manchester, England. The theft occurred on the night of 29 September 2009. The equipment was recovered in late December 2009. Their song \\"Give a Little Love\\" was used in an episode of Cougar Town titled \\"Here Comes My Girl\\" which first aired on 25 November 2009. The single \\"Blue Skies\\" was used in an episode of One Tree Hill titled \\"Some Roads Lead Nowhere\\" which first aired on 7 December 2009. The song was also used in an advertisement for the film The Descendants. The First Days of Spring has been met with very positive reviews, showing more critical acclaim than their previous release. 'NME called the album \\"immense\\" and gave it a strong 9/10, whilst The Times awarded the album a full five stars. Towards the end of 2009 The Guardian newspaper put it at number 7 in their top albums of 2009. The Times newspaper put the album at number 9, and was also in Amazon's top albums of 2009. =Last Night on Earth (2010‚Äì2012)= In January 2010, it was announced that Noah and the Whale were heading to the recording studio soon to prepare their third album, for which the band was considering the title Old Joy, Demos for the new album were recorded at Bethnal Green Great Synagogue in London, featuring original drummer Doug Fink, but the band eventually recorded the album in Los Angeles, working with producer Jason Lader. Later, in an interview with the website SoonerMusic.com, lead singer Charlie announced that the album would be called Last Night on Earth. On 3 December 2010 the band released a track from the upcoming album on their official website, titled \\"Wild Thing\\". The first official single from the album, \\"L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.\\", was released on 23 January 2011, peaking at number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. Last Night on Earth was released on 7 March 2011 through Mercury Records. During this period, Michael Petulla was introduced as the band's new drummer. Bassist Matt Owens and guitarist Fred Abbott auditioned upwards of 100 drummers, after placing an advertisement on Gumtree and eventually narrowed it down to 10, from which point the band rehearsed with each to see which was the best fit. Petulla, the last auditionee of the day, was picked. Following the commercial success of Last Night on Earth, the band toured extensively, including three separate treks to the United States. \\"There was a week where we did Japan, Australia, Canada and Chicago in eight days. And I hate flying\\", remarked Fink. Noah and the Whale performing at the Boston House of Blues in October 2013 In 2011 the song \\"Waiting for My Chance to Come\\" was used in the series finale for the UK teen drama Skins. The song \\"Give It All Back\\" was released on YouTube on 25 November 2011. =Heart of Nowhere (2013)= In January 2013, the band announced that they would be releasing a new album, entitled Heart of Nowhere on 6 May 2013, along with a four-show 'residency' at London's Palace Theatre (24 April 2013 and 5, 12 and 19 May 2013).

When all the tapes had been found, the band then made the album available for the public to listen to on their website. The album's second single, \\"Lifetime\\", was released in August 2013. The single was accompanied by a recording of the band performing Daft Punks's Digital Love and a music video created by Fourteen-Nineteen. After the album's release, the band embarked on the \\"Heart of Nowhere Tour\\" which included shows in Britain and North America, as well as headlining Wilderness Festival and supporting Vampire Weekend in their UK arena tour during November 2013. On 22 November 2013, the band announced a final date of the tour at the Islington Assembly hall on 10 December, a show which mainly consisted of requests from the audience, before taking some time out to work on new material. On 24 December 2013, they released a short film titled Heart of Nowhere as a \\"way of saying thank you for an amazing 2013\\". =Hiatus and split (2013‚Äì2015)= Following their shows at London's Islington Assembly Hall and Manchester's Deaf Institute in December 2013, the band embarked on a period of 'hiatus'. After nearly a year of radio silence, the band responded to fan appeals to updates by posting links to their personal social media accounts. In a tweet that has since been deleted, Fink confirmed on his personal Twitter that Noah and the Whale were still together in early 2015. However, on 1 April 2015, the band announced on social media that they were to split. After the split, Matt Owens announced a solo album, as did Fred Abbott, who also helped to form the new band Orphan Colours with former members of Ahab and Danny and the Champions of the World. Hobden began touring with Mumford & Sons as well as playing alongside both Abbott and Petulla as Matt Owens' backing band, \\"The Delusional Vanity Project\\" before joining Australian band Gang of Youths. Abbott released his debut solo album Serious Poke in July 2015, and has continued working with Hobden on a yearly Christmas project entitled \\"The Heathen and the Holy.\\" In June 2015 Fink shared a new track titled \\"My Heartbeat Lost Its Rhythm\\", on SoundCloud. Fink also announced that he would be writing the music for the Old Vic theatre production of the Dr. Seuss classic The Lorax, and later released his debut studio album Cover My Tracks, in 2017, which was also accompanied by a stage show in which he performed. With the aid of an on-line campaign for the release of the band's first two albums onto vinyl, which was started in 2014, the re-release of Peaceful, The World Lays Me Down and The First Days of Spring onto vinyl was announced for 18 May 2018.

Early life As the son of Archambaud de Talleyrand- P√©rigord (1762‚Äì1838) and Madeleine Olivier de Senozan de Viriville (1764‚Äì1794), he was the nephew of the minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand- P√©rigord (1754‚Äì1838), the 1st Duke of Dino. Career In 1812, Edmond also received a regiment in Brescia (north Italy) from Talleyrand, and on 19 September 1813 was promoted to oberst. He served in the War of the Sixth Coalition, commanding three Chasseur regiments under major-general Leopold Wilhelm von Dobsch√ºtz (1763‚Äì1836) at the battle of M√ºhlberg in 1813, where he was captured. By October 1823 he had become lieutenant-general. His uncle Talleyrand sought a high position for Edmond. He could not rise in France, since Napoleon had banned all French heiresses from marrying outside the French nobility and since Talleyrand had fallen from favor in 1807 after his resignation as Foreign Minister. Thus, at the Congress of Erfurt in 1808, he approached Tsar Alexander I of Russia for permission for a marriage between Edmond and Dorothea von Biron, as a reward for Talleyrand's diplomatic services. Talleyrand was certain of gaining permission from the bride's mother, since he was on friendly terms with her and since payment of her annual apanage was dependent on Russia. Personal life On 21 April 1809, Edmond married Princess Dorothea Biron von Kurland (1793‚Äì1862) in Frankfurt am Main. Though Edmond was indifferent about the match, she was from German- Baltic nobility, as the illegitimate daughter of Alexander Batowski and Dorothea von Medem though her mother's husband, Peter von Biron, the last Duke of Courland, who acknowledged her as his own. Edmond and his wife had children, but by 1812 their married life was over, with Dorothea having become his uncle's lover and (after his death in 1838) his sole heir. They first separated in March 1816 and their official separation from Edmond came in 1824. Their children were: * Napol√©on Louis de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, 3rd Duke of Talleyrand, Duke of Valen√ßay (1811‚Äì1898) * Doroth√©e de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1812‚Äì1814), who died young * Alexandre Edmond de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1813‚Äì1894), who married Marie Valentine Jos√©phine de Sainte-Aldegonde (1820‚Äì1891) * Jos√©phine Pauline de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1820‚Äì1890), who married Henri de Castellane (1814‚Äì1847). Talleyrand died on 14 May 1872 in Florence, Italy, where he had lived for the past 40 years.

The species is endemic to the Southeastern United States. Description Adults of O. ventralis grow to in total length, although the head-body length is only at most. There are 99 or more scales along the lateral groove. In this species, no dark longitudinal stripes are present below the lateral groove or under the tail, and there is no distinct mid-dorsal stripe. The neck is marked with a series of mostly vertical, or highly irregular, white marks, with white markings on posterior corners of scales. Dorsally, older specimens have a pattern consisting of numerous longitudinal dark lines or dashes. Occasionally, similar parallel lines cover the entire mid-dorsal area. Older adults may be greenish above and yellow below; this is the only Ophisaurus species that may have a greenish appearance. Juveniles are khaki-colored and usually have two dark stripes that run down the back.Conant R (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition.

No subspecies are currently recognized. Distribution O. ventralis is commonly found from extreme southeastern Virginia to south Florida and west to Louisiana. Isolated records exist of its occurrence in Oklahoma and Missouri. Diet O. ventralis eats a range of insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets and beetles, and will also consume spiders, small mice, snails, and the eggs of other reptiles and ground-nesting birds. Unlike snakes, glass lizards do not have flexible jaws, and this limits the size of prey items they can consume. They forage both above ground and underground in burrows.

The ballet premiered on May 12, 1983 at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet. Production Choreographer Jerome Robbins was first invited to direct Philip Glass's opera, Akhnaten. Due to the unusual nature of the opera, Robbins decided to make a ballet with the music first and figure out the stage directions. However, due to scheduling conflict, Robbins withdrew from the opera, but went ahead with the ballet. Though the score is minimal, Robbins decided to treat it differently. He made charts of the music's structure on graph paper, then worked with Ronald Bates, who also designed the lighting, to make backdrop that looks like a piece of graph paper. Robbins also added \\"Rubric\\" and \\"Fa√ßades\\" from Glass's Glassworks, as the scores \\"struck him as being markedly different in character.\\" Robbins also claimed that since he was focused on the music during the creative process, he was surprised to see the critics interpret it as \\"images of urban life.\\" On the entire ballet Robbins said it has a \\"a ritualistic sense\\" which may be \\"inevitable\\" due to Glass's music. The ballet was the first New York City Ballet (NYCB) work set to minimalist music and premiered shortly after the company's co-founder George Balanchine's death. Structure The first part, \\"Rubric\\", features dancers in bright color practice wears walking across the stage, and three main couples performing different choreography. Whenever the couples enters the stage, the corps de ballet change their movements. Robbins said it is like a rondo. The middle section is set to \\"Fa√ßades\\", which Robbins described as \\"a songlike melody repeated five times\\". The principal couple is the equivalent of the score while an all-female corps dances at the back of the stage in a line, representing the accompaniment. The third and final movement, danced to Akhnaten is called \\"tribal\\" by Robbins, with dancers performing in bloc patterns. Original cast Rubric: Fa√ßades: Revivals Other ballet companies that had performed Glass Pieces includes the Paris Opera Ballet, Joffrey Ballet and San Francisco Ballet. The former two companies and NYCB all included the ballet in their Robbins Centennial celebrations. Videography In light of the impact of the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, Paris Opera Ballet released a video recording of Glass Pieces, as a part of the Tribute to Jerome Robbins program. NYCB released a 2017 video recording of the third movement.

Writedown ‚Äì The Ref Ob writes down (decreases) its outstanding principal amount Principal Shortfall ‚Äì The Ref Ob fails to make schedule principal payments Settlement Mechanism Credit Events (Failure to pay Principal, Writedown, Distressed Downgrade): A Notice of Settlement usually can be sent by the buyer only if the event is deemed to be a \\"credit event\\" by the buyer; the intent is to physically settle. The Buyer of protection has the option to physically settle or cash settle- if the Buyer chooses to physically settle, the a credit event has occurred. Floating Rate Payment Events (Failure to pay Principal, Interest Shortfall, Writedown): A Notice of settlement can be sent by the calculation agent and/or the buyer of protection for failure to pay principal and writedown. The difference between this being a credit event and a floating rate payment event is that when an event occurs, the buyer chooses to cash settle and the trade continues (pay as you go). Interest shortfall is not considered a credit event in any instance, and is always cash settle.

It is very popular with tourists travelling along the Black Forest High Road. According to legends, the lake is inhabited by a Nix and the King of the Mummelsee. With a circumference of 800 meters, the Mummelsee is the largest of the seven cirque lakes in the Black Forest, the deepest at 17 m deep and the highest at 1036 m.  Geography  The Mummelsee has a circumference of approximately 800 m (2,625 ft) and is surrounded by steep and forested mountain slopes on its northern, western and eastern sides. The western lakeside rises towards the mountain \\"Katzenkopf\\" (1,123 m (3,684 ft) above sea level) and the northern lakeshore rises towards Hornisgrinde. With 1,163 m (3,816 ft) above sea level, Hornisgrinde is the highest mountain in the Northern Black Forest. Solely the southern lake banks are (nearly) flat. This also being the place where the alpine hotel \\"Mummelsee\\" and the close-by St. Michaels chapel are located.  Etymology  According to statements made by the town Seebach, the name of the Mummelsee derives from the (German) vernacular term \\"Mummeln\\" used for white waterlilies (Nymphaea alba). In the past, this species of plant could be found in large numbers in that area. The yellow pond lily, Nuphar lutea, is also called \\"Mummel.\\" The myth of the nix, which were called \\"M√ºmmlein\\" (diminutive form of \\"Mummel\\"), possibly could have been the namesake of the lake as well. Connected to this context, the white waterlily is also referred to as \\"Nixblume\\" meaning \\"nix flower\\".  Tourism  The Chapel of St Michael at the Mummelsee Favoured by the route of the Schwarzwaldhochstra√üe, the lake became a tourist destination. A bigger building that includes the hotel, two restaurants, one grocery and souvenir store, as well as a paddleboat rental is located directly near the visitors' car park. A great part of the hotel building burnt down on 5 May 2008. The fire was presumably a case of arson. After the incident, the hotel was rebuilt in the \\"Schwarzwaldstil\\" with an increase of usable floor space from 2,385 m2 (25,672 ft2) to 3,690 m2 (39,719 ft2) and reopened on 26 March 2010. The Chapel of St Michael was inaugurated in 1937. It was dedicated to the Archangel Michael, an impressive reminder at a time when the National Socialists were gaining more power. From the outside, the low roof of the chapel is striking. It is modeled on a Black Forest house. The slim tower stylises a Black Forest fir. = Trails = Formerly, the naturally existing trail around the lake was kept in its original state with several tight passages and obstructive tree roots. In 1999, the Kunstpfad am Mummelsee, a sculpture path by international artists was installed along the circular trail. It presents 18 installations of artists visualising the connection of nature, landscape and art. In 2014, the path was reconstructed barrier-free. The long-distance hiking trail with the red diamond (Westweg from Pforzheim to Basel) passes here as well as the other regional routes (blue and yellow diamond) and circular hiking trails. It is only a short trip up to the Hornisgrinde (1.5 km and 120 meters in altitude). Other trails are: * the Mummelsee-Hornisgrindepfad (circular walk, length: 3.9 km, suitable for dogs), and * the Hochmoorsee-Mummelsee (circular walk, length: 5.6 km): Seibelseckle ‚Äì Hochmoorweg ‚Äì Bismarckturm ‚Äì Hornisgrinde ‚Äì Chapel St Michael at Mummelsee. = Transportation = Visitors' parking spaces are located at the southern lake shore. Busses for hiking tourists drive to Baden-Baden, Achern and Freudenstadt on a daily basis. On weekends, there are direct bus connections available to Oppenau and once on Saturday and Sunday each to Offenburg. The \\"Baden-W√ºrttemberg-Ticket\\", \\"Sch√∂nes-Wochenende-Ticket\\" and the \\"Konus-Ticket\\" (sold by the Deutsche Bahn and local bus companies) are valid to use on all these routes.  The Mummelsee in literature  * Once located in complete isolation and lacking any road connections, the lake is surrounded by quite a number of myths. According to one legend, a nix lived in the lake and bestowed people with her guidance, danced, sang and played with them at night. * These legends inspired Eduard M√∂rike to write the poem Die Geister am Mummelsee. * In his work of adventure fiction Simplicissmus, Grimmelhausen used the lake and its inhabitants to tell about the dive to the centre of the earth. The description of the system of underwater pathways from the surface towards the centre of the earth might have been inspired by Plato's dialogues (Phaedo). * August Schnezler, editor and collector of legends, wrote three poems (Der Mummelsee, Die Lilien and Mummelsees Rache) about mythical incidents at the lake.

Kreis Sagan, Niederschlesien) was a Prussian \\"general of cavalry\\", the \\"hero of Dennewitz\\" and \\"liberator of Wittenberg\\", military governor of the Rhine province and of Breslau. He was Gutsherr of Z√∂lling, which his wife had inherited, and the G√ºtern Ober- and Nieder-Briesnitz as well as Sch√∂nbrunn, all in the district Sagan. As to the year of his birth, there are different statements: The year 1763 is belied by his gravestone inscription and the \\"Seniority List of the royal Prussian army for the year 1801\\"; in his marriage certificate of 1787, his age is indicated as 28 years, according to which he would have been born in 1759. In other sources, one finds the years 1761 and 1764, though 1763 is more likely to be correct. Family Though nothing certain is known as to his parents, his mother was an only daughter from the old Silesian noble family of Dobsch√ºtz. His father is thought to have been a civil servant in Brzeg. Since almost every detail of his military career is known yet there is not a single reference to his parents or birthplace in the official documents, he may have been illegitimate or descended from an illegitimate branch of the family. On 27 November 1787, as a 22-year-old second lieutenant, he married the 17-year-old Henriette von Braun (1770, probably at Gut Z√∂lling - April 5, 1854, Glogau, Lower Silesia) at Gut Z√∂lling. She was the eldest daughter of Hans Carl Christoph von Braun and Maria Sophia von Lehwald. The marriage remained childless, though they adopted Friedrich Heinrich Konrad Viktor von L√ºtzow (1818‚Äì1831), a nephew of Henriette. Military career =Training= After attending Gymnasium in Brieg (before 1776), Dobsch√ºtz had begun his military career at 14 by entering the 11th Dragoon Regiment as a junker (v. Mitzladd, v. Bosse, v. Voss), rising to ensign on 26 December 1778 and serving in the garrison at Sagan the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778-79. On 24 August 1785 he rose to second lieutenant in his dragoon regiment. In July 1786 Peter von Biron, Duke of Courland, joined the garrison, as did the Duke of Sagan in 1786. The July issue of the \\"Schlesischen Provinzialbl√§tter\\" included the following: \\"around 6 o'clock at the Schultheater im Schlo√ü of the officers were drilled. Herr Lieutenant von Dobsch√ºtz directed the whole and played the main role with old Beyfall. His Highness honoured him with a gold medal, costing 12 ducats.\\" In 1787 Dobsch√ºtz married. =First Coalition= On 30 May 1791 he became first lieutenant and on 13 May 1791 was appointed staff-captain (captain). Then, between 1793 and 1795, he joined the War of the First Coalition against the French (participating in the battles at Pirmasens, Kaiserslautern and Trippstadt). During this time he remained in the 11th Dragoon Regiment and on 20 November 1794 he rose to the rank of major. =Gr√ºnberg= In 1795 he served in the garrison at Gr√ºnberg, where in 1798 his commander major-general von Voss remarked he was \\"a good staff officer, who was not lacking in military skills, and endeavours to gain more, brave before the enemy, who recommended himself\\". On 14 March 1799 he was appointed head of the 4th Squadron, in which post he twice weekly distributed Rumford's Soup to children and the poor. The \\"Schlesischen Provinzialbl√§tter \\" wrote on 18 February 1804 \\"Herr Major von Dobsch√ºtz ...always worthy of the most notable awards, has become the first free-willing member of this institution. He also let this soup be prepared at his own expense.\\" Already on 24 July 1798 he qualified for a rise to the canonicate at St Nikolai zu Magdeburg, awarded him by Frederick William III of Prussia. =Third and Fourth Coalitions= On 15 June 1805 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and on 15 June 1806 to oberst. Also in 1806 he took part in the Silesian campaign, in which he was captured by the French. On 13 March 1807 he had already been listed by the king for \\"replacement\\" (i.e. release from active service), but after the Peace of Tilsit (July 9, 1807) he was still part of a prisoner exchange. In a letter dated 20 December 1808 Dobsch√ºtz asked the king that he be reinstated in the army, but on 24 February 1809 this request was finally rejected. Reluctantly withdrawing into civilian life, Dobsch√ºtz gathered round him a circle of like-minded Patriots. In January 1810 Dobsch√ºtz again asked the king to re-enlist him, but received a letter again rejecting the request on 28 February. The letter did, however, promise to make him an officer on half pay. On 1 November 1812 he was the temporary head of the Amt of the Landrat for Landkreis Sagan, his birthplace, all the while making repeated rejected requests to re-enlist. =Sixth Coalition= At the beginning of the War of the Sixth Coalition, on the very day of the Prussian declaration of war against France (16 March 1813) he made another request to join up. He was accepted on 1 April and from May, again as an Oberst, he was president of the organising-committee for the establishment of the Silesian Landwehren. On 6 May 1813 he was made Divisions-Chef of the 2nd Division of the Silesian Landwehr of Landkreises of Glogau, Sagan, Sprottau, Schwiebus and Gr√ºnberg. On 23 May he received the command of Crossen (in whose organisation he had been instrumental), and started on 24 May began with the Marsch. On 27 May he claimed a transition at Crossen - one for the Silesian Army and the important Berlin posts - against the French superiority under marshal Claude Victor-Perrin. Dobsch√ºtz deceived his opponent into thinking he had a military force that did not in fact exist - of 4.5 battalions and 5 squadrons the infantry was defective and the cavalry and artillery lacked munitions. On 4 August 1813 Dobsch√ºtz was promoted to major- general in command of IV Army Corps (\\"von Tauentzien\\"), a reserve corps. In this role he took part in several coalition victories such as those in Brandenburg at Gro√übeeren, Zahna (4 September 1813), J√ºterbog and Dennewitz (6 September 1813), and most especially at Gro√üenhain (Sachsen) and Dessau (Sachsen-Anhalt), becoming known as the \\"hero of Dennewitz\\". Thus, for example, at M√ºhlberg on the Elbe (Brandenburg) on 19 September 1813 he beat 3 French chasseur regiments and captured their commander Edmond de Talleyrand- P√©rigord, with only 1 squadron of black hussars and 2 squadrons of the Pommeranian Landwehr and colonel Slowaisky's two \\"Pulks\\" (i.e. regiments) of Cossacks. After a short command at Berlin, on 22 October 1813 he began the siege of Wittenberg, held by the French under general Jean Fran√ßois Cornu de Lapoype. On the night of 12/13 January 1814, at 2am, he finally took its fortress, despite having requested the king to be relieved of this command on 20 November the previous year. An important source for the siege is the Diary of the siege artillery for the evening of 28 December 1813 to the morning of 13 January 1814, written by the \\"Plauzen, Obrist and commanding engineer- officers of the 4th Army Corps, tasked with managing the siege of Wittenberg\\" written on 14 November 1814.Lit.: Plotho, Teil 3, Seite 124f. It contains the following account: An unknown source quoted Dobsch√ºtz's words to his soldiers before the storming: After the capture of Wittenberg he was commander of the corps blockading the citadel of Erfurt and, after the corps took it on 16 May 1814, commandant of Erfurt.Carl Gottlieb Merker, parish priest in Kurzlipsdorf, wrote in \\"Das Kriegsjahr 1813\\" (Lit: merker): \\"...As a consequence not Dobsch√ºtz but supreme commander Tauntzien took the honour of be called the taker of Wittenberg, but the latter was found during the siege of Wittenberg in Kemberg. However, Dobsch√ºtz was subsequently governor of Dresden...\\" On 19 October 1814 Dobsch√ºtz was made military commandant of the Prussian occupying forces in Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony, and in this post he set up a smoking ban in the city.

Doug Armati undertook research work on digital copyright issues at Murdoch University in Western Australia in 1990‚Äì91 before taking a role in international efforts to standardize the identification of digital objects. After a speech on the importance and potential economic benefits of uniform approach to identification of digitized copyright content to the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 1994 he wrote two pivotal reports in 1995 ‚Äì the first for the STM group on Information Identification and the second for the Association of American Publishers on Uniform File Identifiers. Armati's work for these global publishing bodies was an important catalyst for the birth of the Digital Object Identifier Foundation. His 1996 speech at the joint ICSU/UNESCO Electronic Publishing in Science conference in Paris on \\"Tools and standards for protection, control and archiving\\" and his book later that year on \\"Intellectual Property in Electronic Environments\\" both helped frame the legal, scientific and technical debate in the emerging field of Digital Rights Management. Armati was also part of the digital copyright experts group that worked closely with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period leading up to the ratification of the WIPO Copyright Treaty in December 1996. In 1996 Armati joined InterTrust Technologies, the leading company in the then nascent field of Digital Rights Management, where he was a member of the leadership group through the company's 1999 IPO until its sale to Sony and Philips in early 2003. During his time with InterTrust, Armati was also active in international standards groups, having been a vice-chairman of the Recording Industry Association of America's international Secure Digital Music Initiative, a board member of the Open eBook Forum (now the International Digital Publishing Forum) and a significant contributor to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), particularly in the development of a standard for the management and protection of intellectual property in MPEG-4, MPEG-7 and MPEG-21.

History The Foksal Gallery was founded in 1966 by a group of Polish art critics and artists, which included one of the founder members of the Polish Constructivist Group of the 1920s.Article on Henryk Stazewski From the outset the gallery's activities were underpinned by the strong philosophical basis embodied within the essay \\"Wprowadzenie do ogolnej Teorii Miejsca (Introduction to the general Theory of Place)\\" (1966). The critics associated with the Foksal Gallery; Anka Ptaszkowska, Mariusz Tchorek, Wies≈Çaw Borowski established the gallery as a \\"place, a sudden gap in the utilitarian way of world comprehension\\", in which art could exist without reference to context or history, a place exempt from outside rules or influence.Conceptual Art in Poland - Spaces of discourse They also proposed that the venue, \\"as the most authentic theme of the event\\", was now to become the actual subject. In addition to the aforementioned critics, the artist-founders at the Foksal included Tadeusz Kantor, Roman Owidzkiego, Edward Krasinski (whose signature blue Scotch tape intervention still winds its way through the gallery's ancillary spaces),Frieze obituary of Edward Krasinski Zbigniew Gostomski Zbigniew Gostomski 2007 and Henryk Sta≈ºewski. Zbigniew Gostomski (b. 1932), a founder artist of the Foksal Gallery, held the inaugural exhibition on 1 April 1966 showing works of his Optical Objects series. Tadeusz Kantor and Wlodzimierz Borowski were involved in actions at the gallery during the 60's. The Foksal succeeded in showing work of an avant-garde nature throughout the communist era, apart from a short period of martial law, during which it was 'closed for renovation'.Theory Of Place For its first twenty years the Foksal Gallery functioned within the state controlled system, nonetheless succeeding in developing an internationally significant programme of contemporary art under the Directorship of Wieslaw Borowski in co-operation with Andrzej Turowski. Milada ≈ölizi≈Ñska also curated a series of exhibitions. Jaromir Jedlinski (previously of the Museum Sztuki in ≈Å√≥d≈∫), was the gallery's Director from July 2006 until August 2008. Nowadays the gallery is run by the younger generation of curators: Katarzyna Krysiak (Artistic Director/Head Curator), Lech Stangret and Monika Weychert Waluszko. The gallery acted under the auspices of the Laboratory of Arts Plastycznych (PSP) until 1982, then under SBWA until 2001. At present, it remains government funded under the Mazovia Region Centre For Culture and Art (MCKiS). The Foksal Gallery has for many years been one of the most influential art galleries in Poland, with shows by many internationally acclaimed artists including Christian Boltanski, Henryk Sta≈ºewski, Joseph Beuys, Royden Rabinowitch, Anselm Kiefer, Luc Tuymans, Bill Viola, Tadeusz Kantor, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Koji Kamoji, Leon Tarasewicz, Douglas Gordon, Matthew Barney, Marek Chlanda and Victor Burgin among many other notable names. In 1997 the Foksal Gallery Foundation was formed to widen the scope of activities of the gallery. Initially based within the Foksal Gallery, the Foksal Gallery Foundation moved out in 2001 and now operates, somewhat controversially (because of the historic \\"Foksal\\" brand usage among others), as an independent and commercial entity, that has nothing to do with the Foksal Gallery activities whatsoever. Name and Location The gallery is named after Foksal, the name of the street at the end of which it can be found. 'Foksal' is said to be a Polish corruption of 'Vauxhall' the name given to the street when the Foksal park area was created in the nineteenth century by a merchant who had been inspired by the atmosphere of London's Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in Vauxhall.

The status of dob-dobs tended to be somewhat ambiguous and they were generally the less academic monks who had an interest in sports, fighting and other 'worldly' matters. Disruptive influences or peacemakers? Dob-dobs sometimes acted as self-appointed policemen in the monasteries. Geshe Lama Konchog for example recalled being beaten by his dob-dob uncle in Sera for being over-eager to study and take Tantric initiations. Dob-dobs were often seen as potential trouble-makers with Sir Charles Bell describing in his portrait of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama how dob-dobs were foremost amongst monks at large religious ceremonies who were \\"bursting with superfluous energy, and spoiling for a fight\\". However, dob-dobs also contributed many positive qualities to monastery life. According to Jos√© Ignacio Cabez√≥n of the Tibetan & Himalayan Digital Library: Life as a dob-dob Tashi Khedrup became a candidate to join the dob-dobs in Sera in 1951, when he was nearly 15 years old. He describes how the dob-dob fraternity worked for its members: > The association I joined had about 36 members who came from different > colleges all over the monastery. That made it possible to meet a lot of new > friends. There was no entrance fee, but each member contributed what he > could to a common fund from which we bought food, which we ate in one > another's rooms. Usually meetings were held in the room of the leader... He > had been a famous jumper and fighter, but was very quiet in his manner > though he saw to it that discipline was properly kept. Clubs of that sort, > which we called kyidu -- that means that everyone shares the good and bad > alike -- might last for many years or might break up and reform into new > groups. If a member died, a share of his property went to the kyidu, some > went to pay the men whose duty it was to cut up his dead body, and the rest > to his college. For the teen-aged Tashi Khedrup at least, sartorial elegance was a big part of the fraternity: > Dob - dobs were always very proud of their clothes and looked after them > carefully. We liked a specially dark shade of expensive, fine woollen cloth > for our long skirt - like garment. It had to be folded carefully into a > number of pleats, rather like a kilt and when we were in our rooms we > usually took it off and put it under a board and sat on it to press the > pleats. The front part had to be quite flat, again like a kilt. And I could > now grow my hair long. There were strict rules about the exact length and > manner in which it had to be cut; the right side was brushed downwards and > the left was bunched up into a big curl. We all took a lot of trouble to > keep our hair well and rubbed it regularly with vaseline. Monastery laborers In terms of running the monastery, the main task of the dob-dobs was to perform essential domestic labor for the upkeep of the building and the monks inhabiting it. Brian Harris recounts of a visit to the monastery in the 1990s and how \\"sixty dob-dobs would come to help and mix the porridge with a large wooden paddle\\" at Thikse Monastery, Ladakh, Northern India. Genge Lobsang Samdup recounted how at Ganden Monastery it was the dob- dob who played the thongchen, or long horns, and who also provided the tent for the 14th Dalai Lama's visit. Dob-dobs and 'bookmen' The dob-dob appears to have a similar role to that of the lay brother in religious orders of Catholicism. Likewise, in Gelug monasteries, the 'bookmen' monks have a similar position within the monastery to the Catholic choir monks.

Family Elisa von der Recke was born in Sch√∂nberg, Skaistkalne parish, Courland, the daughter of Graf (later Reichsgraf) Johann Friedrich von Medem and his wife, Luise Dorothea von Korff. Her younger half-sister was Dorothea von Medem, for whom she carried out diplomatic work. In 1771 she married Kammerherr Georg Peter Magnus von der Recke, living with him at Neuenburg Castle (now Jaunpils Castle). She separated from him in 1776 and divorced in 1781. Their daughter, Frederika von der Recke, died in 1777. Life In 1787 her first book, Nachricht von des ber√ºchtigten Cagliostro Aufenthalt in Mitau im Jahre 1779 und dessen magischen Operationen, a memoir-expos√© of the months when she studied magic with \\"Count\\" Alessandro di Cagliostro, made a great impact right across Europe, with Catherine the Great even granting Elisa lands in Russia in recognition of the work (making Elisa financially independent). She got to know Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, Herder and other European literary figures, and intensified their relationships through prolific correspondence. From 1798 she lived almost exclusively in Dresden, and from 1804 cohabited there with her friend Christoph August Tiedge. Their meetings were religio-sentimentalist in tone, with the singing of chorales by Johann Gottlieb Naumann. Her works consisted mainly of pietist-sentimentalist poems, journals and memoirs. Elisa von der Recke looked after thirteen foster daughters. She died in Dresden and is buried at the in Dresden.

The VFH utilizes a statistical representation of the robot's environment through the so-called histogram grid, and therefore places great emphasis on dealing with uncertainty from sensor and modeling errors. Unlike other obstacle avoidance algorithms, VFH takes into account the dynamics and shape of the robot, and returns steering commands specific to the platform. While considered a local path planner, i.e., not designed for global path optimality, the VFH has been shown to produce near optimal paths. The original VFH algorithm was based on previous work on Virtual Force Field, a local path-planning algorithm. VFH was updated in 1998 by Iwan Ulrich and Johann Borenstein, and renamed VFH+ (unofficially \\"Enhanced VFH\\"). The approach was updated again in 2000 by Ulrich and Borenstein, and was renamed VFH*. VFH is currently one of the most popular local planners used in mobile robotics, competing with the later developed dynamic window approach. Many robotic development tools and simulation environments contain built-in support for the VFH, such as in the Player Project.VFH+ in Player/Stage/Gazebo VFH The Vector Field Histogram was developed with aims of being computationally efficient, robust, and insensitive to misreadings. In practice, the VFH algorithm has proven to be fast and reliable, especially when traversing densely-populated obstacle courses. At the center of the VFH algorithm is the use of statistical representation of obstacles, through histogram grids (see also occupancy grid). Such representation is well suited for inaccurate sensor data, and accommodates fusion of multiple sensor readings. The VFH algorithm contains three major components: # Cartesian histogram grid: a two-dimensional Cartesian histogram grid is constructed with the robot's range sensors, such as a sonar or a laser rangefinder. The grid is continuously updated in real time. # Polar histogram: a one-dimensional polar histogram is constructed by reducing the Cartesian histogram around the momentary location of the robot. # Candidate valley: consecutive sectors with a polar obstacle density below threshold, known as candidate valleys, is selected based on the proximity to the target direction. Once the center of the selected candidate direction is determined, orientation of the robot is steered to match. The speed of the robot is reduced when approaching obstacles head-on. VFH+ The VFH+ algorithm improvements include: # Threshold hysteresis: a hysteresis increases the smoothness of the planned trajectory. # Robot body size: robots of different sizes are taken into account, eliminating the need to manually adjust parameters via low-pass filters. # Obstacle look-ahead: sectors that are blocked by obstacles are masked in VFH+, so that the steer angle is not directed into an obstacle. # Cost function: a cost function was added to better characterize the performance of the algorithm, and also gives the possibility of switching between behaviors by changing the cost function or its parameters. VFH* In August 2000, Iwan Ulrich and Johann Borenstein published a paper describing VFH*, claiming improvement upon the original VFH algorithms by explicitly dealing with the shortcomings of a local planning algorithm, in that global optimality is not ensured. In VFH*, the algorithm verifies the steering command produced by using the A* search algorithm to minimize the cost and heuristic functions. While simple in practice, it has been shown in experimental results that this look-ahead verification can successfully deal with problematic situations that the original VFH and VFH+ cannot handle (the resulting trajectory is fast and smooth, with no significant slow down in presence of obstacles).

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Valley was one of the main manufacturing centers in New England, and most of the Valley communities were emblematic New England mill towns. In 2000, the seven towns in the extended Lower Naugatuck Valley region were selected as an All-America City, varying the title of that award as \\"All-America Valley\\". History This was the most prosperous part of Connecticut in the early days of industrialization. The region was the location of key factories in national industries, most notably the brass industry, rubber manufacturing, petrochemical production and shipbuilding. Naugatuck was the birthplace of Naugahyde. This industrial past has given the region a heavy urban landscape, with many factory buildings rising prominently along the riverside and dominating the central districts of the towns. Much can be learned about the history of this downstream portion of the Naugatuck Valley on the Facebook page entitled LowerNaugyValleyHistory. After the Great Depression, however, the area began a prolonged period of deindustrialization and lost large portions of its manufacturing base, leaving behind weak economies and empty buildings typical of Rustbelt landscapes. In 1955, the area's fortunes were further impaired when floodwaters brought by Hurricane Diane devastated the region. From Naugatuck to Shelton, entire downtown neighborhoods were washed away, leaving the region in disaster. High unemployment, poverty, and isolation marked the more urban Naugatuck Valley cities through the 1980s. Floodwaters even went into surrounding areas such as the lower portion of the Greater Waterbury area. Since the early 1990s, rural and southern portions of the Naugatuck Valley have evolved into sprawling commuter towns. Communities like Shelton and Oxford have become popular bedroom communities for residents working in New York City and lower Fairfield County. Vast sections of farmland up and down the Naugatuck Valley have also been developed for the building of luxury homes. Despite this suburbanization, however, the region is still tied to its core city centers like Derby and downtown areas of Ansonia and Naugatuck, thus retaining its working-class flavor. During the Vietnam War, factories such as the Naugatuck chemical plant were key players in the production of the chemical Agent Orange, heavily used in herbicidal warfare. Culture Along with other towns in Connecticut, the Naugatuck Valley maintains a high emotional and cultural involvement with its high school football teams and their rivalries. Football shapes many peoples lives in the valley with high school alumni, faculty and students giving a huge fan base which also includes families and town citizens. The Naugatuck Valley League serves six high schools in the Valley: Derby, Naugatuck, Oxford, Woodland, Seymour, and Ansonia. The Naugatuck Valley League also contains nine schools that are outside of the Valley: Kennedy, Torrington, Watertown, Crosby, Holy Cross, St. Paul, Wilby, Wolcott, and Sacred Heart. Politically, the Valley is far more conservative than much of the rest of Connecticut, and supported George W. Bush in the 2004 election, centrist Senator Joe Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary; and favored Republicans John McCain in the 2008 election, Mitt Romney in the 2012 election, Donald Trump in the 2016 election, and Thomas C. Foley in the 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial elections. The Valley is home to the Valley Arts Council. The council was established under the guidance of the Greater Valley Chamber of Commerce in 2000. The Council serves the seven municipalities that comprise this region. The region is particularly strong with many talented Artists of all skills, mediums and levels. The Arts Council has a fine Art gallery on Main Street in downtown Ansonia (est.2019). The gallery was in neighboring Derby for over ten years. Surprisingly, the Valley is a wealth of Artists and Artisans. Some world class artists, in their specific genres, work and live in these communities. The Valley also has a notable population of Poles, with shops and other various services catering to this population.

The region comprises 13 towns: Beacon Falls, Bethlehem, Cheshire, Middlebury, Naugatuck, Oxford, Prospect, Southbury, Thomaston, Waterbury, Watertown, Wolcott, and Woodbury. Geography The Naugatuck River, which acts as the region's namesake, flows through the center of the region from Thomaston to Beacon Falls. The river begins at the confluence of Jakes Brook, Hart Brook, and Hall Meadow Brook in the western part of Torrington and flows before entering the Housatonic River in Derby. The Central Naugatuck Valley is one of three regions that comprises the Naugatuck River Valley, the others being the Lower Naugatuck Valley, also known as \\"The Valley\\", and the Upper Naugatuck Valley, which is part of the larger Litchfield Hills region. Demographics Racial and ethnic distribution in the Central Naugatuck Valley In 2010, the total population of the Central Naugatuck Valley Region was 287,768, an increase of 15,174, or 5.6%, from 2000. The fastest growth occurred in the suburban towns of Oxford, Middlebury, and Beacon Falls, which each experienced a population growth of over 15%. Waterbury, with a population of 110,336, is the largest city in the region and fifth largest city in Connecticut. Naugatuck (31,862) and Cheshire (29,261), are the second and third largest municipalities in the region. Similar to state and national trends, the population of the Central Naugatuck Valley is becoming increasingly diverse. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the racial makeup of the region was 79.4% White (72.4% non-Hispanic White), 9.2% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 2.2% Asian, 6.1% from other races, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 14.8% of the region's population. Racial and ethnic minorities represented 20.6% of the region's population, a 34% increase from 2000. A vast majority (77%) of the region's minority population lives in Waterbury. In 2010, there were 109,735 households in the region. 49.4% of households were made up of married couples living together, 26.4% were single-person households, 19.0% were headed by a single parent with no spouse present, and 5.2% were non-family households. The median age for the region was 40.4 years old. 23.9% of the population was under the age of 18, 8.2% was 18 to 24 years old, 11.0% was 25 to 34 years old, 13.7% was 35 to 44 years old, 28.7% was 45 to 64 years old, and 14.5% who were 65 years of age or older. Per capita income for the region was $30,779, which is below the state average of $36,755. Median household and median family income vary significantly from town to town. Waterbury, the poorest municipality in the region, had a median household income of $40,254 and a median family income of $47,077. On the contrary, Cheshire was the wealthiest municipality in the region with a median household income of $107,936 and a median family income of $123,539. About 10.6% of the population was below the poverty line. The top 10 largest ancestry groups in the region are: * 23.6% Italian * 18.0% Irish * 9.1% German * 8.9% English * 7.3% Polish * 6.5% French * 2.9% Portuguese * 2.7% French Canadian * 2.2% American * 1.8% Lithuanian Economy Historically, the economy of the Central Naugatuck Valley was dominated by the manufacturing sector. Large corporations such as Chase Brass and Copper Company, the American Brass Company, the United States Rubber Company (later renamed Uniroyal), and Timex all have their roots in the Central Naugatuck Valley. Like other manufacturing centers in New England, the Central Naugatuck Valley has been plagued by deindustrialization since the 1960s, as many manufacturers moved to the South and Midwest or abroad, where production was cheaper. Similar to national trends, the regional economy is becoming increasingly dominated by the service sector. Transportation =Highways= I-84, just west of downtown Waterbury Interstate 84 and Route 8 serve as the primary highways in the region. Interstate 84 links the region with Hartford, and Boston to the east and Danbury, and New York State to the west. Route 8 is the major north-south highway in the region and connects with Torrington, and the Litchfield Hills to the north, and to the Lower Naugatuck Valley and Bridgeport to the south. A small segment of Interstate 691 is located in the town of Cheshire, and connects Interstate 84 to Interstate 91 and Connecticut Route 15. =Bus= Local bus service is provided by CT Transit through Northeast Transportation Company. Service is found primarily in Waterbury, and also extends into the neighboring towns of Cheshire, Middlebury, Naugatuck, Watertown, Wolcott. With the completion of the Hartford-New Britain Busway in 2014, a new express bus will run between Waterbury and Hartford. Peter Pan Bus Lines operates intercity buses out of Waterbury. =Rail= The Waterbury Branch of the Metro North Railroad contains stations at Waterbury, Naugatuck, and Beacon Falls. With the exception of one morning express train to Stamford, all passengers must transfer at Bridgeport to Metro North, Shoreline East, or Amtrak trains. Travel time from Waterbury to Grand Central Terminal is approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes. The Railroad Museum of New England runs seasonal excursion trains on the Naugatuck Railroad from Thomaston to Waterbury and Torrington. =Air= Waterbury-Oxford Airport, located in the town of Oxford, offers facilities for corporate, freight and recreational flights. As of 2010, the airport handled 137 aircraft operations per day., effective 2007-07-05 Government Like all Connecticut towns, the towns in the Central Naugatuck Valley have strong home rule tradition. Although Connecticut is divided up into eight counties, these counties do not have a formal governments and lack administrative power over member towns. In its place, Connecticut is divided up into 9 planning regions who are responsible for regional transportation and land-use planning. The Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments (NVCOG) is the metropolitan planning organization for the region and acts as a forum where chief elected officials can discuss issues of common concern and to develop programs to address them on a regional level.

Plot As described in a film magazine, fascinated by the lure of white robes and dancing, Bava (Bara) enters the Temple of Buddha. She is soon disillusioned and, yielding to the entreaties of Major John Dare (Thompson) of the British army, she flees with him and becomes his wife, incurring the enmity of Ysora (Kennard), high priest from the temple. A child is born to the two but is later found dead with the Buddhist death mark on its forehead. This withers the soul of Bava, who leads her husband around the globe in search of happiness. Hardened by sorrow, she turns against Dare and bids him gone. At a Paris resort she meets a theatrical manager (Warwick) who is fascinated by her dancing. She accepts an offer to appear at his theater. At the night of her premiere her husband attempts a reconciliation, but is unsuccessful and kills himself in her dressing room.

Unlike other avoidance methods, the dynamic window approach is derived directly from the dynamics of the robot, and is especially designed to deal with the constraints imposed by limited velocities and accelerations of the robot. It consists of two main components, first generating a valid search space, and second selecting an optimal solution in the search space. In Fox et al. the search space is restricted to safe circular trajectories that can be reached within a short time interval and are free from collisions. The optimization goal is to select a heading and velocity that brings the robot to the goal with the maximum clearance from any obstacle.

Vaginal contractions are generally an involuntary muscular response to sexual stimulation, including sexual arousal, and are commonly most intense during sexual stimulation and culminating in orgasm. Though usually an involuntary response, some women can control the muscles of the vagina to perform vaginal contractions at will. Vaginal contractions enhance the sexual experience and pleasure for both parties during sexual intercourse. In a 1982 study, pelvic contractions of 11 women who manually self-stimulated to orgasm were monitored using an anal probe and a vaginal probe simultaneously. Near the perceived start of orgasm, a series of regular contractions began in 9 of the women, with anal and vaginal contractions synchronizing with each other. Three of the women's orgasms consistently included only a series of regular contractions; for six other women, orgasms consistently continued beyond the regular series with additional irregular contractions. Two women had no regular contractions during reported orgasms. The women showed marked differences in orgasm duration and the number of contractions. A 1994 study confirmed these results, but concluded that some women experience their orgasm regularly without contractions and some report having contractions during orgasm only occasionally. Vaginal contractions are caused by both the activity of certain brain regions and the release of the hormone oxytocin. It has been suggested that vaginal contractions during orgasm can increase the chances of pregnancy as they transport sperm up the reproductive tract from the vagina to the oviducts, which decreases the distance it has to travel. Additionally, when the woman is fertile, sperm is only transported to the side of the dominant ovary. Involuntary vaginal contractions may arise from non-sexual causes. Involuntary spasm of the muscles around the vagina, usually caused by anxiety, can result in vaginismus. Vaginal contractions should not be confused with uterine contractions.

During World War I the ship was commissioned 25 April 1918‚Äì11 September 1919 for United States Navy service as USS Manchuria (ID-1633). After return to civilian service the ship was acquired by the Dollar Steamship Line in 1928 until that line suffered financial difficulties in 1938 and ownership of Manchuria was taken over by the United States Maritime Commission which chartered the ship to American President Lines which operated her as SS President Johnson. During World War II she operated as a War Shipping Administration transport with American President Lines its agent allocated to United States Army requirements. After World War II, she was returned to American President Lines, sold and renamed SS Santa Cruz. The liner was scrapped in Italy in 1952. Construction Manchuria was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Company of Camden, New Jersey, for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company on 3 September 1902, among the first ships built at the yard as contract number six. An attempt to launch the ship on 31 October 1903 failed when the ship stuck on the ways. The ship was successfully launched on 2 November having been sponsored by Miss Laura Wick. The design of Manchuria was identical to which was delivered as Manchuria was being fitted out. Both were among the largest ships being built in the United States as had been the line's previous trans Pacific liners Korea and Siberia of 1902 and both were given the American Bureau of Shipping rating and Lloyd's Register classification of 100-A1. At the time of construction the two vessels were the largest passenger ships built in the United States and were built for 346 first class, 66 second class and 1,300 steerage passengers. The ships' design tonnage was with tonnage for Manchuria increasing with modifications. On completion of a major refit 19 January 1929 for Dollar Line's around the world service the ship's tonnage is noted as being with a \\"sea speed\\" of indicating possible propulsion upgrades. Lloyd's Register of 1932‚Äì33 shows the ship, then President Johnson, at and in the 1945‚Äì46 register as .The Lloyd's change is shown between the 1940‚Äì41 and 1941‚Äì42 register issues. The hull was double bottomed with a capacity of 2,270 tons of fresh water for boilers or ship use with trimming tanks in the peaks and three deep tanks, one forward and two aft of the engine room, for a total water ballast of 4,600 tons. There were five complete decks composed of orlop, lower, middle, upper and shelter decks with the strength deck at the shelter deck rather than usual upper deck with ten watertight bulkheads running up to the upper deck. Normal coal capacity was 1,950 tons but that could be increased by use of reserve bunkers to 2,800 tons. Two , quadruple expansion four cylinder (, , and all stroke) engines drove twin three bladed propellers with manganese bronze blades of diameter with adjustable pitch from to on a cast iron hub. Electrical power was provided by three General Electric 25 kilowatt direct connected generators located in a recess aft of the main engine room and refrigeration by a carbonic anhydride plant, built by the British company J & E Hall, located below and aft of the engine room in a space between the shafts cooling about of space and capable of producing up to of ice. Steam powering main engines and auxiliaries was provided by eight main, forced draft boilers; four double end and four single end, delivering steam at a working pressure of . There was a small auxiliary boiler located on the middle deck aft of the after fire room hatch. A combined fire extinguishing and fumigation system could send gas for either purpose throughout the ship. First-class passengers had quarters in the midship house on the bridge and shelter decks with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dining room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the engine casing on the shelter deck with another set in the center of the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either light cargo or steerage passengers and, in the event of Chinese steerage passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area. Early career Manchuria departed New York on 9 June 1904 for San Francisco to begin Pacific service with sister ship . In connection with the United States recently having acquired territories of the Philippines, Guam and Hawaii and President Theodore Roosevelt wanted to show American influence in the area. He decided to send a diplomatic delegation to the area. On 8 July 1905 the Manchuria left San Francisco with a delegation led by Secretary of War William Howard Taft. As of 1907 Pacific Mail shows Manchuria, along with Mongolia, as being chartered vessels, though the company had paid for both Korea and Siberia, thus adding to an operating deficit for the period. Additional problems had fallen on the company, the disruption of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, political instability in Central American republics and specific \\"disasters\\" to Manchuria and Mongolia in Hawaiian waters. Manchuria was disabled at Oahu and had to be put into dry dock in November 1906 for repairs that were completed by 1 June 1907 but her exit was delayed by San Francisco strikes and delayed permanent repairs to Mongolia that had been damaged in an incident at Midway. 1915 advertisement shortly before the ships were sold The disaster to Manchuria occurred at 4:10 in the morning on 20 August 1906 when the ship went aground between Rabbit Island and Oahu resulting first in evacuation of passengers and mail during the day as efforts were organized to pull the ship off the reef. Damage progressed even as the efforts to pull the ship off the reef continued over a period of days with mention \\"boilers are starting from their foundation and may go out of commission\\" in a communication dated 23 August. At 12:50 in the afternoon of 16 September Manchuria is noted as \\"coming off the reef\\" and being towed stern first. It had taken a small fleet of vessels, including the Commercial Pacific Cable Company's , \\"USS Manning\\"Manning, despite court references, was not in U.S.N. commission at the time but was under the United States Revenue Cutter Service and taking her 13 December 1905‚Äì8 May 1907 Hawaiian break from Bering Sea Patrol duties. and among various commercial and government vessels involved in taking off passengers, luggage, mail and cargo, delivering water and supplies and other functions. The apparent misunderstanding of the arrangements for Restorer in the salvage resulted in claims in court. The strange \\"coincidence\\" of two of the company's ships stranding in the Hawaiian Islands within hours and the brief stranding of the Army transport from the Philippines, , also aground on Oahu, was likely not coincidental. The 1906 Valpara√≠so earthquake had occurred hours earlier and mariners' descriptions of a \\"tremor\\" spreading on the Pacific's bed and \\"disturbing currents\\" at the time of the strandings would now be recognized as indications of tsunami effects. By 1907 predictions of economic trouble had become fact with the consequence, in the words of His Majesty's consul in Manila in his report for 1907, that \\"the American flag disappears from the Pacific trade with the single exception of the Northern Pacific Steamship Company's passenger-freighter Minnesota.\\"The referenced would be the 20,602 ton ship of 1904, a predecessor of Northern Pacific's and sister of , that was built by Eastern Shipbuilding Company, New London, Connecticut and sold for scrap in 1923. Robert Dollar noted that Pacific Mail anticipated enforcement of a seamen's act that would \\"make it impossible to operate American ships profitably in foreign trade\\" competing with foreign lines and sold its ships before waiting until the act was actually enforced‚Äîas it was not. In a Pacific left \\"almost devoid of the American flag\\" by 1916 the five ships Korea, Siberia, China, Mongolia and Manchuria had been sold in the fall of 1915 to International Mercantile Marine Company for $5,250,000 (¬£1,075,000) which registered most of its ships under the British flag. The ship began service with one of International Mercantile Marine's subsidiary companies, the American Line, in 1915.In 1921 International Mercantile Marine Company owned all stock in the American Line, Atlantic Transport Line, George Thompson and Company, Ltd., Leyland Line, Panama-Pacific Line, Red Star Line, White Star Line, White Star‚ÄîDominion Line and held minority interest in Shaw, Savill and Albion Company, Ltd., Holland-America Line and the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. The fleet total was 120 ocean-going ships aggregating not less than 1,300,000 gross tons.(Pacific Marine Review, November 1921, page 654.) At 19:16 on 13 June 1917, Manchuria was standing out of New York Harbor in a thick fog when she collided with the United States Navy monitor , suffering damage below the waterline. Attempting to clear, Manchuria scraped the Amphitrite‚Ä≤s bow, and her propeller strut fouled her cable, holding her fast for 20 minutes. Manchuria lowered her boats and her crew abandoned ship; two section patrol boats and a motor sailer stood by and took her lifeboats in tow. Ultimately, Manchuria was towed and beached off Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York. World War I U.S. Army troops on board Manchuria leaving France to return to the United States. The United States Shipping Board requisitioned Manchuria and Mongolia from the Atlantic Transport Line, a subsidiary of International Mercantile Marine, and turned the ships over to the Army in January and February, 1918.Both American Line and Atlantic Transport Line were subsidiaries of the International Mercantile Marine Company (see article) and exactly which line \\"owned\\" the ship's hull is perhaps the reason for the apparent difference in ship's operation by American Line and references having the ship \\"acquired\\" from Atlantic Transport Line. The two ships were among the largest transports with a troop capacity of around 5,000. In late January 1918, with the \\"shipping situation getting out of hand\\" the regular meeting of top government and military logistics people decided to create the Shipping Control Committee (SCC) that was ratified in early February with the consequence the Army turned its entire fleet over to the SCC resulting in the Navy operating those ships. Manchuria was acquired by the Navy from the United States Shipping Board on 10 April 1918 and commissioned USS Manchuria (ID-1633) at New York on 25 April 1918, Commander Charles S. Freeman in command, and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force. Manchuria departed New York with a convoy on 30 April with the 18th Field Artillery and the 153d and 154th Infantry Battalions embarked for Europe arriving in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 May to debark her passengers. Five days later she returned to the east coast, arriving at New York on 30 May. The troop transport made 13 round trips to Europe with nine of them after the Armistice, bringing approximately 39,500 troops home. On 25 August 1919 she arrived New York, decommissioned there 11 September, and was returned to her owner. Interwar years Manchuria began service on the New York to Hamburg with the American Line in December 1919. In 1923 she was shifted to New York‚ÄìPanama Canal‚ÄìSan Francisco run to operate under another subsidiary of International Mercantile Marine Co., the Panama Pacific Line. Manchuria at new municipal pier, San Diego, California 1925, where increased demand made San Diego a Panama Pacific port of call. In November 1924 the ship and line's regularly scheduled ports of call for Manchuria, Mongolia, and included San Diego, with the new schedule being New York and San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland, California, Portland, Oregon and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. Until the scheduled departure of Manchuria from New York on 12 February 1925 only passenger traffic had been accepted for San Diego, but with regional and city leaders urging service the line began accepting freight as well beginning that departure. On 1 November 1928 she was renamed President Johnson and sold seven days later to Dollar Steamship Lines for round‚Äëthe‚Äëworld cruises. On 3 November 1928 Dollar delivered the ship to Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company for a major refit and passenger space renovation that was completed 19 January 1929. All old first class quarters were stripped and replaced with seventy-five staterooms and twenty- five new private baths for 175 first class passengers. All public rooms were renovated, a new deck house was built on the boat deck for a smoking room and verandah cafe with a by \\"play ground\\" atop. Much of the interior decoration and furnishing was done in San Francisco and shipped east to the shipyard for installation. A steel tank swimming pool was added on top of the after deck house. President Johnson was being featured in the first class only around the world service \\"as you please\\" with 1930 fares as low as $1,110 or $1,370 with private bath and tickets good for two years for visiting twenty-two ports in fourteen countries. Departures from the United States by a President liner every two weeks from the Puget Sound ports for Japan and around the world while another President liner departed New York every two weeks for Cuba and California by the Panama Canal and then from Seattle and Vancouver, Canada for the voyage to Japan and around the world. In 1933 the ship was chartered for the 7th Annual Floating University around the world voyage of 137 days visiting 37 countries and islands, 45 ports and 140 cities and places with credit granted by special arrangement throu universities. The ship, to depart 4 February from New York, is described as a \\"floating campus\\" with class rooms, library, athletic facilities with student fares as low as $1,325 including tuition and shore trips.A number of student newspaper announcements during late 1932 to January 1933 with more detail note this is the first annual trip on a United States registered ship. The Dollar Steamship Company, along with other Dollar companies and the ships were acquired by the United States Maritime Commission in an Adjustment Agreement on 15 August 1938 in which stock in the line was transferred to release $7,500,000 of the line's debt. The commission invested $4,500,000 in the new American President Lines with, over the years, $20,000,000 in grants to the line. World War II On 29 November 1941 the War Shipping Administration (WSA) took control of President Johnson from American President Lines and allocated the ship for Army use, though the ship was operated by American President Lines as the WSA agent.The Army never operated the ship under a bareboat charter and thus strictly speaking the ship was never formally a United States Army Transport (U.S.A.T.). American President Lines operated the vessel under various agreements until the ship was redelivered to the company by WSA. President Johnson, along with the Army chartered and the Army transport , departed from San Francisco for the Philippines on 5 December with 2,500 troops, the 2d Battalion of the 138th Field Artillery Regiment and three squadrons of the 35th Pursuit Group aboard. Upon the attack on Pearl Harbor the ships, including the WSA transport which had departed 6 December, turned back and unloaded the some 15,000 troops and supplies aboard the ships 8‚Äì9 December.President Garfield had come under War Shipping Administration control on 29 November 1941 and was operated by American President Lines as a troop transport until acquired by the Navy 1 May 1943 to be the remainder of the war. (MARAD Vessel Status Card information) On 31 January 1942 the ship left San Francisco transporting the garrison for Christmas Island, code named BIRCH, that was a critical link in the South Pacific lines of communication to Australia. The garrison, designated Task Force 4591, transported was composed of an infantry battalion, two battalions of coast artillery, the 12th Pursuit Squadron and the 150-bed 1st Station Hospital composed of 14 officers and 100 enlisted men for a total of about 2,000 troops that arrived at the island 10 February. President Johnson continued transporting troops for the next two years in support of the amphibious operations which had penetrated by July 1945 to the Japanese home islands. With stops at Eniwetok and Guam, Marshalls; Ulithi, Carolines; Peleliu, Palaus; and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, long behind her, President Johnson returned to San Francisco 14 January 1946 to end her World War II service as a troop transport. Later career President Johnson was redelivered to control of American President Lines on 2 March 1946. The Maritime Commission approved the sale of the ship to Transmar Ltd. of Lisbon and change to Panamanian registry. On 10 January 1947 President Johnson was sold to Tagus Navigational Co. of Panama City, Panama and renamed Santa Cruz. The ship was intended for general trade between Portugal and South American ports in Brazil and Argentina with particular attention to emigrants from Portugal to those countries. General Engineering & Dry Dock Company was contracted to remove all armament and military equipment, convert the troop berthing spaces into spaces for 1,200 steerage passengers, convert the troop ship officer's quarters into space for 134 cabin class passengers and restoration of the public spaces (Social Hall, Tea Room Verandah, Smoking Room and dining) of the ship to civilian levels. Machinery was examined, overhauled and replaced where necessary and the ship's plumbing and electrical systems modified for the rearranged spaces. The work, costing well over $1,000,000 was completed in thirty-eight days. She was chartered to Societa Saicen of Savona, Italy, in 1948 to transport Italian war refugees to South America. The transport was scrapped at Savona on 12 January 1952.

Gordon Edwards and starring Theda Bara. It is based on the short story \\"Maria of the Roses\\" by George Scarborough. Plot As described in a film magazine, when Maria Valverda (Bara) refuses the attentions of Diablo Ramirez (Nye), he starts an insurrection among the native Filipinos. Maria's father Don Ramon is killed and Maria is held hostage. She gets word to Capt. Paul Winter (Roscoe) of the American troops in Manila and he comes to her assistance, but his troops are outnumbered and they are made prisoners by the revolting revolutionists. Maria and Paul attempt to escape, but they are caught and brought back. At the Manila headquarters, trouble is suspected and reinforcements are sent. Before long, the revolt is subdued and peace reigns over Maria's home, and happiness over the betrothal of Maria and Paul. Historical background As noted by researcher Nathan Bradford, \\"At the time when 'Under The Yoke' was made, American policy towards the Philippines consisted of a promise to grant independence at some unspecified future time, when Filipinos would be 'ready', grants of a limited amount of autonomy, and a firm resolve to maintain US rule 'for the time being'. Well within living memory - in fact, just sixteen years before the film was made - the US used considerable force to put down those Filipinos impertinent enough to seek independence in the here and now. The film, made for the general American public, naturally reflects this narrative: beautiful Filipina damsel in distress threatened by the literally diabolic Filipino rebel; chivalrous American officer comes to the rescue; eventually, the revolt is crushed, American rule reinforced, Filipina and American officer get married, Happy End\\".Dr. Nathan Bradford, \\"1901-1935: How Americans and Filipinos regarded each other\\" in \\"Proceedings of the Second International Academic Conference on the Cultural Images of Colonial Domination\\", Capetown, 1999 Cast * Theda Bara as Maria Valverda * G. Raymond Nye as Diablo Ramirez * Albert Roscoe as Capt. Paul Winter * Edwin B. Tilton as Don Ramon Valverde * Carrie Clark Ward as Duenna Reception Filming a scene with Theda Bara Like many American films of the time, Under the Yoke was subject to restrictions and cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors cut, in Reel 3, the execution of Don Ramon, Reel 4, scene between Maria and Diablo where he kisses her on the shoulder, and required three scenes of torturing an American soldier be shortened.

Biography Tiedge was the eldest son of the rector of the Gelehrten Stadtschule in Gardelegen and his wife, and studied law in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. In 1788 he went to Halberstadt, acting for four years as secretary to the Domherr von Steder. After the Domherr died, Tiedge and his family moved to the vicinity of Quedlinburg. After the death of his wife, von Steder, in 1797, he alternated between living in Halle and Berlin and (from 1805 to 1808) accompanying his friend Elisa von der Recke through Germany, Switzerland and Italy. From 1819 Tiedge lived with Elisa in Dresden. Placed beyond material care by his friend's last will, he continued to live there after her death until his. Some singable lyrics, of which ‚ÄúSch√∂ne Minka, ich muss scheiden‚Äù is an example, first established his reputation, and Urania √ºber Gott, Unsterblichkeit und Freiheit (1800; 18th ed., 1862), a lyric-didactic poem, inspired by the ethics of Emanuel Kant, enjoyed wide popularity in the beginning of the nineteenth century. A kind of sequel to it were the Wanderungen durch den Markt des Lebens (1833). Among his other poetical efforts, the Elegien und vermischte Gedichte (1803) met with the greatest success. After his death, the Tiedge Foundation was established in Dresden for the purpose of caring for the poet's grave and of granting subventions to poets and artists or their widows and children. Administered by the Saxon Ministry of Public Instruction, its funds amounted to more than 662,000 marks in 1901.

It began as LuxRender in 2008 before changing its name to LuxCoreRender in 2017 as part of a project reboot. The LuxCoreRender software runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.  Overview  LuxCoreRender features a 3D renderer; it relies on other programs (3D modeling programs) to create the scenes to render, including the models, materials, lights and cameras. This content can then be exported from the application for rendering. For Luxrender, fully functional exporters are available for Blender, Daz Studio; partially functional ones are available for Cinema 4D, Maya, SketchUp and XSI. Luxrender is also fully supported as a production renderer in 3DS Max. For LuxCoreRender, Blender is supported through the BlendLuxCore plugin. After opening the exported file, LuxCoreRender renders the scene. Various tweaks to post processing settings can be set via graphical user interface and the scene control file. A significant feature of LuxCoreRender is that the user is able to change the balance of different lights while the image is still being processed.  History  = Luxrender = LuxCoreRender originally started as LuxRender in 2008. LuxRender was based on PBRT, a physically based ray-tracing program. Although very capable and well-structured, PBRT focuses on academic use and was not easily usable by digital artists. As PBRT is licensed under the BSD License, it was possible to start a new program based on PBRT's source code. With the blessings of the original authors, a small group of programmers took this step in September 2007. The new program was named LuxRender and was to focus on artistic use. Since its initial stage, the program has attracted a small handful of various programmers around the world. On 24 June 2008, the first official release was announced. This was the first release that is considered to be usable for the general public. = LuxCoreRender v2.x = The plan for LuxRender v2.0 was defined during the 2013 summer and one of the major components is a new engine based on the C++ and Python APIs. The old C API suffered from many limitations when it came to modern features like dynamic scene editing and interactive rendering, so it was decided to write a completely new API instead of improving the old one. LuxCore is the name of the new C++/Python API. It offers all the features shown by SLG (SmallLuxGPU), including a dynamic camera, texture, material, and object editing, and more. During the 2017 winter, LuxCoreRender v2.0 was defined as a LuxCore API focused render package, dropping any old code related to LuxRender v1.x. A new website, forum, wiki, Blender exported, etc. were developed in order mark a new fresh project restart.  Features  Rendering of a school interior with LuxRender. Modeled in Blender. = Luxrender 0.8 = The main features of LuxRender as of version 0.8 include: * Biased and unbiased rendering: Users can choose between physical accuracy (unbiased) and speed (biased). * Full spectral rendering: Instead of discrete RGB colour bands, full spectra are used for internal calculations. * Hierarchical procedural and image based texture system: Procedural and image based textures can be mixed in various ways, making it possible to create complex materials. * Displacement mapping and subdivision: Based on procedural or image textures, object surfaces can be transformed. * Network and co-operative rendering: Rendering time can be reduced by combining the processing power of multiple computers. IPv6 is also supported. * Perspective (including shift lens), orthographic and environment cameras. * HDR output: Render output can be saved in various file formats, including .png, .tga and .exr. * Instances: Instancing significantly saves system resources, in particular memory consumption by reusing mesh data in duplicated objects. * Built in post-processing: While rendering, you can add post processed effects like bloom, glare, chromatic aberration and vignetting. * Motion blur, depth of field and lens effects: True motion blur, both for the camera and individual objects, and physically accurate Lens Effects, including Depth Of Field. * Light groups: By using light groups, one can output various light situations from a single rendering, or make adjustments to the balance between light sources in real time. * Tone mapping * Image denoising * Fleximage (virtual film): Allows you to pause and continue renders. The current state of the render can be written to a file, so that any system can continue the render at a later moment. * GPU acceleration for path tracing when sampling one light at a time. * Film response curves to emulate traditional cameras color response (some curves are for black&white; films too). * Volumetric rendering using Homogeneous volumes by defining an interior, and exterior volume. * Subsurface Scattering = Luxrender 1.0 = New features included in Luxrender 1.0 include: * An experimental Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping integrator (SPPM). * GPU-accelerated \\"Hybrid Bidirectional\\" path tracing using the GPU for ray-intersection calculations. * Support for multiple GPUs. * New and updated materials, including metal, car paint, glossy coating, and layered materials. = LuxCoreRender 2.0-2.3 = Features included in the LuxCoreRender 2.0+ project reboot (current version) include: * Microkernel pure-OpenCL \\"Path\\" render engine, supporting any number of GPUs and OpenCL-enabled CPUs concurrently. * Interactive viewport rendering, including real-time material and object manipulation. * Material node support. * Light groups, allowing the user to change the intensity and color of lamps during the rendering process. * Embree accelerated BVH building. * A \\" Direct Light Sampling Cache\\" to accelerate scenes with many light sources. * A \\"Photon Global Illumination\\" cache to accelerate complex scenes, including support for caustic photon cache and vertex merging. * Support for Open Intel Image Denoiser (OIDN). * Blender Cycles scene conversion, including (limited) support for automatic interpretation of Cycles materials and textures. * Advanced material properties, including glass dispersion (using Cauchy's transmission equation), rough glass (for creating frosted glass or ice), metal, car paint (using multiple reflective coatings), and velvet (to represent fuzzy surfaces). *Support for physically based light units like lumen and candela, as well as traditional gain and exposure controls. *Support for subdivison shapes, displacement shapes, and vector displacement of displacement shapes. = LuxCoreRender 2.4 = Features included in the LuxCoreRender 2.4 update include: * Support for using more than 64 logical processors in Windows. * Support for CUDA rendering on NVIDIA graphics cards, with out-of-core capability. * The ability to create materials with thin-film interference.

Fossils of Anoplotherium were first discovered in the gypsum quarries of Paris in 1804 and were subsequently described by French naturalist Georges Cuvier.Wiley Interscience One of the first Paleogene mammals to be described, 19th Century reconstructions of Anoplotherium can be seen at Crystal Palace Park. Skull of Anoplotherium commune.  Etymology  The genus name Anoplotherium is a compound of the Greek prefixes 'Œ±ŒΩ' ('an') meaning 'not', 'ŒªœÄŒªŒøŒΩ' ('h√≥plon') meaning 'armed' and the suffix 'Œ∏ŒÆœÅ' ('thƒìr') meaning beast or wild animal. Therefore, the genus name has a full meaning of 'Unarmed Beast', a reference to the lack of tusks or horns.  Palaeontology  Fossils attributed to the genus Anoplotherium have been found in Late Eocene to earliest Oligocene strata in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal between 37 million and 33 million years ago. Its occurrence in the European fossil record spans European Mammal Paleogene Zones MP17-MP20, and the Headonian European Land Mammal Mega Zone (ELMMZ). In the United Kingdom isolated teeth, bones and a partial skeleton of Anoplotherium have been found in the Priabonian to Rupelian aged Solent Group strata of the Hampshire Basin, a series of freshwater/brackish coastal plain deposits now exposed on the northern coastline of the Isle of Wight. Within the Solent Group fossils have been found in the upper members of the Headon Hill Formation, the Bembridge Limestone Formation and the Bouldnor Formation. alt= First discovered in France, Anoplotherium material has been collected from the famous Late Eocene Gypsum of Montmarte in the Paris Basin and several sites in the Aquitanian Basin, including the karstic deposits of the Phosphorites des Quercy, Eymet in the Dordogne and Apt in Provence. alt= Anoplotherium became extinct during the Grande Coupure, a major faunal turnover event in early Oligocene Europe that saw the extinction of many of the endemic mammal groups typical of Eocene Europe. These groups including the Anoplotheriidae were subsequently replaced by new taxa from Asia such as anthracotheres, entelodonts and rhinocerotids  Paleobiology  Anoplotherium was a relatively large herbivore for Late Eocene Europe, living in typical Headonian faunas alongside groups such as palaeotheres, pachynolophids, creodonts, choeropotamids, xiphonodontids, adapid and omomyid primates, and bear-dogs amongst many others. Anoplotherium may have preferred wooded habitats, with sub-tropical woodland common across much of the genus' range. The dentition of Anoplotherium is selenodont. A 2006 anatomical study by Hooker on specimens from Montmartre, and a near intact skeleton of an immature individual from the Bouldnor Formation of the Isle of Wight, UK, found the skeletal morphology and functionality of Anoplotherium to indicate it was likely capable of bipedal browsing, using its muscular tail for support. Anoplotherium would have been able to browse 2-3m off the ground, greatly reducing interspecific competition with other contemporaneous mammalian herbivores. The study also suggests that two of the originally recognised species of Anoplotherium, A.latipes and A.commune, distinguished on the basis of toe numbers, may instead represent sexual dimorphs of the same species A.latipes.[Bipedal browsing adaptions of the unusual Late Eocene- earliest Oligocene tylopod Anoplotherium (Artiodactyla, Mammalia), J.J Hooker, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 151, 609-659.] Hiard et al. 2014 suggested that if A.latipes and A.commune are sexual dimorphs as suggested by Hooker (with A.latipes representing the male and A.commune representing the female) then the well developed second digit of Anoplotherium latipes may have been an adaption to intraspecific combat between males. The partial skeleton of the immature individual from the Isle of Wight described in Hooker, 2006 was discovered in a fluvial channel horizon containing large coniferous logs. The bones showed signs of post-mortem scavenging by crocodilians, most likely the European alligatoroid Diplocynodon.Foot of Anoplotherium commune at the Museum Histoire Naturelle, Paris.

Gordon Edwards and starring Theda Bara. Plot As described in a film magazine, nurse Lilian Marchard (Bara) is engaged by Mortimer West (Swickard), an old rogue who is dangerously ill. She meets his son Michael (Roscoe), a divinity student, and his earnestness ignites a spark of love within her. Michael professes his ardent love for her in the garden, and that night, coming upon her in Mortimer's bedroom, she misconstrues the situation and becomes angry. The old man dies and Dr. Stone orders her from the house. The years pass and Lilian becomes Poppea, a notorious charmer and dancer of the town. Among her many lovers is Reggie West, Michael's cousin. Michael goes to Poppea to ask her to give Reggie up for his mother's sake, and Reggie, waiting without, shoots himself. Poppea hosts a dinner for several wealthy men and just as she is about to auction herself off to the highest bidder, she receives a bible and lily from Michael. She gives up her fast friends and returns to the slums to minister to the sick, finally winning Michael's love.

(NASDAQ: ERII)http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/erii manufactures energy recovery devices for oil and gas, chemical and water industries globally. Different applications of the company‚Äôs core technologies harness untapped fluid energy or facilitate the transfer of energy between two different fluids, reducing overall operating costs and carbon emissions in a variety of industrial applications such as desalination, ammonia production, gas processing, and hydraulic fracturing. Energy Recovery produces its equipment in a facility located at the company‚Äôs headquarters. Energy Recovery is based in San Leandro, California, with international offices in Dublin, Ireland; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai, China. History Energy Recovery was founded in 1992 by Leif Hague and incorporated in Virginia. The company was reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Energy Recovery began selling products in 1997 and went public in 2008. The company is currently led by president and chief executive officer Robert Mao who was appointed in April 2015. On October 19, 2015, Energy Recovery signed a 15-year licensing agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation granting Schlumberger the exclusive rights to utilize Energy Recovery‚Äôs VorTeq technology in on-shore oil and gas well completions globally. In 2016, Forbes reported that Energy Recovery was the top performing company in California in terms of annual returns on investment, with a return of 317.3%. Products = PX Pressure Exchanger = The PX Pressure Exchanger device is Energy Recovery‚Äôs flagship product used in desalination. The Pressure Exchanger's technology utilizes pressure energy that can reduce electricity and maintenance costs. The device collides two fluid flows, transferring the energy from one fluid to the next. This energy transfer occurs in less than a fraction of a second, reducing the interaction between the two fluids. This product exchanges energy at up to 98 percent efficiency. The technology has helped to make the desalination process economically feasible. Energy Recovery holds a majority market share in the desalination industry. There are 16,000 Pressure Exchangers in operation worldwide. The global desalination market has an annual recurring total addressable market (TAM) of US$50 million. The company‚Äôs technologies have cut more than 14 billion kWh of energy each year and produced more than 12 billion liters of clean water daily. = VorTeq = VorTeq adapts Energy Recovery‚Äôs Pressure Exchanger technology to protect pumps used in the hydraulic fracturing process from fluid damage, improving efficiencies by cutting costs and production time during fracturing jobs. The VorTeq hydraulic pumping system was unveiled at Energy Recovery‚Äôs December 2014 analyst and investor event in New York City. That same year, Energy Recovery filed 43 patents to develop VorTeq‚Äôs technology for use in hydraulic fracturing. On October 19, 2015, Energy Recovery announced a 15-year licensing agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation, granting Schlumberger the exclusive rights to utilize Energy Recovery‚Äôs VorTeq technology in onshore oil and gas well completions globally. A major pain point in hydraulic fracturing is pump failure caused by the sand or proppant-filled fluid. Every year, approximately US$4.1 million is spent by frac crews performing maintenance on pumps, resulting in an average 40 percent redundancy in equipment on site. The proppant-filled fluid passes through VorTeq so that high pressure pumps aren‚Äôt damaged. This allows the pump fleet to pump only clean water. VorTeq‚Äôs technology can potentially save companies up to US$1 million per fleet in maintenance costs, and save the hydraulic fracturing industry approximately US$1.4 billion per year. The device is designed to handle up to 110 barrels per minute with a treating pressure of up to 15,000 psi and the core is made of tungsten carbide, which is 1,000 times more resistant to abrasion than steel. Liberty Oilfield Services will be the first company to test VorTeq in 2015 and will conduct the first live well field trials. According to Neal Hagerman, engineering manager at Integrated Petroleum Technologies, ‚ÄúIncorporating the VorTeq system could represent a paradigm shift in how the service company industry approaches preventative maintenance, because hydraulic horsepower pumps will no longer be exposed to the abrasive slurry mixture of proppant and water, the source of most maintenance issues. Eliminating these issues will reduce backup requirements and improve overall operational efficiency.‚Äù =IsoBoost= Energy Recovery‚Äôs IsoBoost system reduces the wear on pumps used in gas processing and ammonia production, reducing maintenance costs and increasing plant runtime. The IsoBoost system is the highest efficiency energy recovery system on the market for amine processing. IsoBoost‚Äôs technology is designed to harness energy from pressure drops in one liquid process flow to boost the pressure in an adjacent flow. At the heart of the IsoBoost system is a hydraulic turbocharger, which is customized for each application to yield optimal operational flexibility at high efficiencies. The IsoBoost system employs a liquid phase turbocharger with maximum flexibility. The device recovers energy in acid gas treatment processes at up to 80 percent efficiency, increasing productivity and profitability and reducing the carbon footprint created during the processes. Energy Transfer partners‚Äô Jackalope plant in Hebronville, Texas, installed IsoBoost in 2008, and the plant‚Äôs total maintenance costs have fallen by 67 percent. =IsoGen= Energy Recovery‚Äôs IsoGen system generates electricity by taking the energy in the fluid and converting it into usable electrical power. The IsoGen turbine, with an electrical generator, captures the pressure energy released by pipelines when fluids flow downhill. When oil or gas travels downhill in a pipeline, it builds pressure, and pipelines use choke valves to release that excess pressure. The energy that is released through this pressure letdown is usually wasted.[12] Through the IsoGen, this energy can be captured and used at the pumping station or transferred into the power grid. In 2015, Saudi Aramco commissioned an IsoGen system for a gas processing plant in the Middle East.

The Washington Post, June 28, 2008. and The New York Times identified Martin as the primary source of false rumors that then- presidential candidate Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election (an allegation Martin had made as early as 2004). In a later interview with CNN, Martin explicitly abandoned this view and now asserts Obama's real father is not Barack Obama, Sr., but African-American journalist Frank Marshall Davis. In October 17, 2008, Martin filed a lawsuit against the state of Hawaii calling for the public release of Barack Obama's birth certificate and other vital records. To counter conspiracy theories that Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States, the Obama campaign previously posted an image of his short-form birth certificate online.

Just before the election, Martin assaulted two cameramen from WPTV, the NBC affiliate in West Palm Beach, while they were interviewing him at the TV station. He was convicted of criminal mischief and sentenced to a year in jail. Though he was freed pending appeal, while on the way out of the courtroom he made personal attacks on the judge, claiming he had be \\"bought and paid for\\". The judge immediately held Martin in criminal contempt of court. For the assault, Martin was sentenced him to a year in jail. However, he was let out of jail after serving only a month by accident due to a \\"paperwork glitch\\". Martin never returned to serve out the remainder of his term, and a warrant was issued for his arrest, making him subject to having to serve 16 months in jail. The warrant was still outstanding as of the time of Martin's 2008 Senate run, but Martin said the issue was being \\"resolved.\\" Mendell, David, and Rick Pearson. GOP slate in Illinois U.S. Senate race . Chicago Tribune, 2008-02-01. Hosted by Illinois Republican Party. =2000= During Martin's 2000 run for president, he accused George W. Bush of using cocaine. In 2003, several months before Saddam Hussein was captured, Martin claimed to have found the former Iraqi dictator's hideout. =2010= Martin was a 2010 Republican candidate for U.S. Senator in Illinois for the seat being vacated by Sen. Roland Burris. In December 2009, Martin ran radio ads which included Martin requesting that one of his primary opponents, Congressman Mark Kirk, answer claims about his sexuality made by Jack Roeser, a radio talk show host. Another ad alleged that Kirk, as well as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, had always known of fellow Congressman Mark Foley's relationship with a former Page, and had done \\"nothing to stop Foley's pedophilia, for years\\", and said, that by extension, Kirk was \\"a de facto pedophile\\". In response, the state Republican Party announced that Martin would no longer be recognized as a legitimate candidate. Martin received 37,359 votes, five percent of the total votes. He attempted to run for the U.S. Senate in the general election as a member of the Reform Party of Illinois, but he did not qualify for the ballot. =Litigation and Anti-Semitic allegations= Over the years, Martin has filed numerous lawsuits, and was labeled as a vexatious litigant by Edward Weinfeld, a federal judge for the Southern District of New York, who observed that Martin had a tendency to file \\"a substantial number of lawsuits of a vexatious, frivolous and scandalous nature.\\" A number of these filings were allegedly anti-Semitic in nature. In a 1983 bankruptcy case, Martin filed a motion calling the presiding judge \\"a crooked, slimy Jew who has a history of lying and thieving common to members of his race.\\" In another motion that year, Martin stated, \\"I am able to understand how the Holocaust took place, and with every passing day feel less and less sorry that it did.\\" He went on to say that \\"Jew survivors are operating as a wolf pack to steal my property.\\" Washington Times: Gadfly's TV ads target Bush in N.H. December 22, 1999. Newsbank archive. When later pressed in an interview about his remarks, Martin claimed that the anti-Semitic comments were inserted into his court papers by malicious judges. In 1983, Jos√© A. Cabranes, a federal judge for the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, issued a sweeping injunction barring Martin or anyone acting \\"at his behest, at his direction or instigation, or in concert with him\\" from filing any new action or proceeding in any federal or state court without first seeking permission from the court in which he wished to file that action or proceeding. Martin- Trigona v. Shaw , 986 F.2d 1384. In his ruling, Cabranes noted that Martin had a tendency to file legal actions with \\"persistence, viciousness, and general disregard for decency and logic.\\" According to Cabranes, Martin's practice was to file \\"an incessant stream of frivolous or meritless motions, demands, letters to the court and other documents,\\" as well as \\"vexatious lawsuits\\" against anyone who dared cross him, including court personnel and their families. For instance, in the midst of the proceeding, Martin sued Cabranes himself, along with the judge's wife. Martin then sought, unsuccessfully, to have Cabranes recused.In re Anthony R. Martin-Trigona, 573 F.Supp. 1237 (D. Conn. 1983) On appeal from Cabranes' ruling, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals limited the scope of the injunction to federal courts, but stated that the federal courts were constitutionally obligated to protect themselves and the administration of justice from vexatious litigants like Martin. Martin-Trigona v. Smith et al. , 737 F.2d 1254. Since then, Martin has continued his pattern of filing legal actions. He has repeatedly been cited for contempt for violating the federal injunction. , 767 F.2d 35 The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida estimated that he has filed thousands of proceedings over the years. In 1993 the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals determined that his mother was acting in concert with him by filing a federal civil rights action against several Florida state officials. The court noted similar wording in the suit filed by Martin's mother and a petition filed by Martin himself. In throwing out the suit, the Eleventh Circuit called Martin \\"a notoriously vexatious and vindictive litigator who has long abused the American legal system.\\" Most recently, a libel and invasion of privacy suit against Media Matters and its founder, David Brock, was dismissed with prejudice because Martin had violated the terms of the injunction. Martin has been sanctioned at the state level as well. He is banned from seeking indigent status in Florida courts due to his history of filing abusive petitions. Martin is also prohibited from filing lawsuits in New York, unless represented by an attorney or with the court's prior approval.Martin-Trigona v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. 546 N.Y.S.2d 910 (N.Y. Sup., 1989) In November 2015, Martin filed a challenge to the appearance of Bernie Sanders on the New Hampshire ballot for the Democratic primary. The challenge was unsuccessful, but Martin announced plans to appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. Role in rumors about Obama =Allegations of Obama being a Muslim= According to a report by journalist Chris Hayes for The Nation, Martin issued a press release shortly after Obama's keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention that he had evidence Obama \\"lied to the American people\\" and \\"misrepresent[ed] his own heritage.\\" Martin claimed that Obama was really a Muslim, was possibly hiding this fact \\"to endanger Israel,\\" and that \\"[Obama's] Muslim religion would obviously raise serious questions in many Jewish circles.\\" Within a few days, the conservative site Free Republic picked up Martin's press release, triggering a long discussion. However, according to Hayes, the issue went dormant after Obama's election to the Senate, only to pick up again in 2006 as rumors spread that Obama was considering a presidential run. In October, a conservative blog, Infidel Bloggers Alliance, reposted Martin's press release in response to a question about Obama's heritage. Then, on December 26, conservative activist Ted Sampley, co-founder of Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry, posted a column suggesting Obama was a closeted Muslim, heavily quoting Martin's original press release. According to Hayes, the first of many emails suggesting Obama was a Muslim was forwarded to Snopes within hours of Sampley's story. Hayes believes that the email was likely a slightly altered version of the Sampley article, which was in turn heavily based on Martin's 2004 press release. Martin told Hayes that he got numerous calls once the emails began circulating. When the callers asked him if he wrote the release, Martin replied, \\"They are all my children.\\" On June 28, 2008 Martin told the Washington Post that he wasn't \\"trying to smear anybody,\\" but that it was \\"just an underreported story.\\" Jerome Corsi's book The Obama Nation, published on August 1, 2008, opens with a quote from Martin on Obama's alleged Muslim heritage and supposed attempts to conceal it. In October, Jim Rutenberg of The New York Times wrote that the book had been \\"widely discredited\\". On October 5, 2008, Martin was featured as a \\"journalist\\" on Hannity's America of the Fox News Channel. According to The New York Times, \\"The program allowed Mr. Martin to assert falsely and without challenge that Mr. Obama had once trained to overthrow the government.\\" In a subsequent appearance on Hannity & Colmes, Robert Gibbs, Obama's communications director, criticized Hannity for allowing Martin to appear on the show. Then-Fox Senior Vice President Bill Shine later retracted support for Martin as a guest: \\"Having that guy on was a mistake. We obviously didn't do enough research on who the guest was.\\" =Allegations of Obama's father being Frank Marshall Davis= In an interview featured on the CNN network's American Morning program on October 27, 2008, Martin explicitly abandoned his view that Barack Obama is a Muslim. In the interview, Martin said that Obama was not the son of Barack Obama, Sr., but rather the son of Frank Marshall Davis, an African American journalist and political activist who wrote for a newspaper in Hawaii in the 1940s and 1950s that was accused by the House Un-American Activities Committee as being a front for the Communist Party USA. Martin claimed that he discovered this after a recent trip to Honolulu, although he offered CNN no substantive proof for the claim. =Lawsuit against the state of Hawaii= President Barack Obama's short-form birth certificate On October 17, 2008, Martin filed a lawsuit in a state circuit court of Hawaii against Governor Linda Lingle and state health department director Dr. Chiyome Fukino, seeking to verify the state's official birth certificate for Obama. Months before this suit, the Obama campaign posted an image of his short-form birth certificate online. Martin's lawsuit sought to order the state to release a copy of Obama's long-form birth certificate. Roig, Suzanne. \\"Suit targets Obama document\\" , The Honolulu Advertiser (October 18, 2008). The short-form birth certificate that the Obama campaign posted online stated that his date of birth as August 4, 1961, his place of birth as Honolulu, Hawaii, and other details. Martin was quoted as saying, \\"I want to see a certified copy issued by the state of Hawai'i, not one issued by the state of Obama.\\" Hawaii State Department and Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo stated that only people with a \\"tangible relationship\\" to a person can access a copy of the person's birth certificate, adding that a 1949 law \\"was enacted primarily to protect your private information, especially in these days where there's ID theft.\\" Attorney General Mark Bennett said that he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it, but said that according to Hawaii Revised Statutes it is unlawful to release vital records to anyone except individuals listed in state records as having close relations with Obama (that is, a spouse, parents, descendants, or someone with a common ancestor). In regard to a designee representing Obama, Okubo says \\"If someone from Obama's campaign gave us permission in person and presented some kind of verification that he or she was Obama's designee, we could release the vital record.\\" On October 22, 2008, in a Honolulu court proceeding overseen by the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe of the First Circuit of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, the court denied Martin's petition for a writ of mandamus to order the release of Obama's vital records. A further hearing was held on November 18. On November 19, the court denied Martin's \\"emergency motion\\" and dismissed Martin's lawsuit, based on Martin's lack of legal standing to obtain another person's birth document. Jim Dooley, \\"Obama certificate lawsuit dismissed: Judge says Net author Martin had no standing to get birth document, Honolulu Advertiser, November 21, 2008. On April 27, 2011, White House staffers gave reporters a copy of the official long-form certificate, and posted a PDF image of the certificate on the White House website. Alt URL The certificate reconfirmed the information on the official short-form certificate released in 2008, and provided additional details such as the name of the hospital where Obama was born.

Overview The founder and first ruler was motel owner Vinko Vukoja‚ÄìLastviƒá. The republic was founded on the day of Diva Grabovƒçeva (29 June) in 2002, named after famous hajduk Mijat Tomiƒá, who had its hiding place in the nearby caves. The seat of this republic is in the motel Hajduƒçke vrleti, whose owner is the sole ruler of this micronation which encompasses the area inside the highest peak of Vran mountain, the chapel of sv. Ante and the Risovac-Ked≈æara highway. It has 73 ministries. This republic has its consul and portparolle. Its day of statehood is on June 5. This republic has also its Constitution, flag, passport, territory and borders. One important thing ‚Äì formation of political parties is strictly forbidden, as well as any dealing with politics, since it is not good for human health. Its state flag has a white background; in the upper left corner is the red the state coat-of-arms - chessboard, and in the middle is with blue color marked the picture of Mijat Tomiƒá. History Problems began when Vinko Vukoja wanted to solve a problem in connection with the main power supply net. As this area was on unclaimed land ‚Äì three municipalities (Posu≈°je, Tomislavgrad and Jablanica, couldn't agree for years under whose responsibility the area fell, and whenever the motel owner asked any of the municipalities to solve its problem, they rejected him, saying it is not their problem, and referred him to one of other two municipalities. Finally, he solved that with his money. So in that alleged \\"no one's land\\" in 2002 Hajduƒçka Republika was proclaimed. On the day of the proclamation, SFOR was alarmed by some persons. As SFOR saw the true nature of this project, they left very same day. The republic has no separatist or hegemonic ambitions. Thanks to this fun protest project, its motel became one of the most popular places in western Herzegovina. Every year, there is a manifestation Triba slagat i ostat ≈æiv (To lie and stay alive). This project attracted the attention of Bosnian, Croat and Serb media, as well as some media outside the Balkans.See the links on this page: Slobodna Dalmacija, Tomislavcity, LJportal, Hercinfo (in Croatian), Osloboƒëenje, Klix.ba, Dnevni avaz (in Bosnian), Nezavisne (in Serbian), Al Jazeera (from Qatar) On 16 October 2009 President Vinko Vukoja died in a car accident.

History and Activities  Founded in 2004 and based in the port city of Busan, Birds Korea has regularly updated websites in both English and Korean. Birds Korea works on a wide range of conservation projects, including research, advocacy, and education programs. As such, the organisation has received wide domestic and international coverage of their work in both online and mainstream media, on issues ranging from Korean outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza (2005‚Äì2006), to the impacts of the Taean oil spill (2007), to pilot restoration work at the Mokpo Namhang urban wetland (2007‚Äì2008), and to concerns over avian biodiversity threatened by the proposed Korean Grand Canal Project (2008). Most notably, in 2006 Birds Korea developed the Saemangeum Shorebird Monitoring Program (SSMP) in partnership with the Australasian Wader Studies Group, monitoring the impacts of the world's largest known coastal reclamation (the 40,100 ha Saemangeum) on populations of migratory shorebirds. Prior to seawall closure in April 2006, Saemangeum was considered to be the single most important shorebird site in the Yellow Sea (Barter, 2002). The SSMP documented (following seawall closure) very major declines of several species of shorebirds within the Saemangeum reclamation area and adjacent wetlands (Moores et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2006; Moores et al., 2007), and through further coordinated survey effort (e.g. the 2008 Birds Korea National Shorebird Survey), declines of species such as spoon-billed sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus (critically endangered) and great knot Calidris tenuirostris at the national level too. SSMP and other shorebird data gathered in 2008 is to be published in time for the Tenth Conference of the Parties of the Ramsar Convention (to be held in Changwon City, South Korea, between October 28 and November 4, 2008), to inform and influence the increasingly urgent debate on the need to better conserve the intertidal habitats and biodiversity of the Yellow Sea.

The term is most commonly used when discussing renewable energy sources, notably solar power and wind power. Grid parity depends upon whether you are calculating from the point of view of a utility or of a retail consumer. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support. It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity. Germany was one of the first countries to reach parity for solar PV in 2011 and 2012 for utility-scale solar and rooftop solar PV, respectively. By January 2014, grid parity for solar PV systems had already been reached in at least nineteen countries. Wind power reached grid parity in some places in Europe in the mid 2000s, and has continued to reduce in price.  Overview  The price of electricity from the grid is complex. Most power sources in the developed world are generated in industrial scale plants developed by private or public consortia. The company providing the power and the company delivering that power to the customers are often separate entities who enter into a Power Purchase Agreement that sets a fixed rate for all of the power delivered by the plant. On the other end of the wire, the local distribution company (LDC) charges rates that will cover their power purchases from the variety of producers they use. This relationship is not straightforward; for instance, an LDC may buy large amounts of base load power from a nuclear plant at a low fixed cost and then buy peaking power only as required from natural gas peakers at a much higher cost, perhaps five to six times. Depending on their billing policy, this might be billed to the customer at a flat rate combining the two rates the LDC pays, or alternately based on a time-based pricing policy that tries to more closely match input costs with customer prices. As a result of these policies, the exact definition of \\"grid parity\\" varies not only from location to location, but customer to customer and even hour to hour. For instance, wind power connects to the grid on the distribution side (as opposed to the customer side). This means it competes with other large forms of industrial-scale power like hydro, nuclear or coal-fired plants, which are generally inexpensive forms of power. Additionally, the generator will be charged by the distribution operator to carry the power to the markets, adding to their levelized costs. Solar has the advantage of scaling easily from systems as small as a single solar panel placed on the customer's roof. In this case the system has to compete with the post-delivery retail price, which is generally much higher than the wholesale price at the same time. It is also important to consider changes in grid pricing when determining whether or not a source is at parity. For instance, the introduction of time-of-use pricing and a general increase in power prices in Mexico during 2010 and 2011 has suddenly made many forms of renewable energy reach grid parity. A drop in power prices, as has happened in some locations due to the late-2000s recession, can likewise render systems formerly at parity no longer interesting. In general terms, fuel prices continue to increase, while renewable energy sources continue to reduce in up-front costs. As a result, widespread grid parity for wind and solar are generally predicted for the time between 2015 and 2020.  Solar power  Projection of levelized cost of electricity for solar PV in Europe = Pricing solar = Swanson's law states that with every doubling of cumulative production of panels, there has been a 20 percent reduction in the cost of panels. Grid parity is most commonly used in the field of solar power, and most specifically when referring to solar photovoltaics (PV). As PV systems do not use fuel and are largely maintenance-free, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is dominated almost entirely by the capital cost of the system. With the assumption that the discount rate will be similar to the inflation rate of grid power, the levelized cost can be calculated by dividing the original capital cost by the total amount of electricity produced over the system's lifetime. As the LCOE of solar PV is dominated by the capital costs, and the capital costs by the panels, the wholesale prices of PV modules are the main consideration when tracking grid parity. A 2015 study shows price/kWh dropping by 10% per year since 1980, and predicts that solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030, whereas the International Energy Agency predicts 16% by 2050. License: cc. Note: Appendix F. A trend extrapolation of solar energy capacity. The price of electricity from these sources dropped about 25 times between 1990 and 2010. This rate of price reduction accelerated between late-2009 and mid-2011 due to oversupply; the wholesale cost of solar modules dropped approximately 70%. These pressures have demanded efficiencies throughout the construction chain, so total installed cost has also been strongly lowered. Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down 99 percent, to 68¬¢ per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The downward move in pricing continues. Palo Alto California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. And in sunny Qatar large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2020 for just $0.01567 per kWh cheaper than any form of fossil-based electricity. The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011, and a decline to prices below $2.00/watt seems inevitable. Solarbuzz tracks retail prices, which includes a large mark-up over wholesale prices, and systems are commonly installed by firms buying at the wholesale price. For this reason, total installation costs are commonly similar to the retail price of the panels alone. Recent total-systems installation costs are around $2500/kWp in GermanyBundesverband Solarwirtschaft Installation Cost of Photovoltaics or $3,250 in the UK.How Much Do Solar Panels Cost in the UK? As of 2011, the capital cost of PV has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further. All that remains to calculate the LCOE is the expected production. Modules are generally warranted for 25 years and suffer only minor degradation during that time, so all that is needed to predict the generation is the local insolation. According to PVWatts a one-kilowatt system in Matsumoto, Nagano will produce 1187 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity a year. Over a 25-year lifetime, the system will produce about 29,675 kWh (not accounting for the small effects of system degradation, about 0.25% a year). If this system costs $5,000 to install ($5 per watt), very conservative compared to worldwide prices, the LCOE = 5,000/29,675 ~= 17 cents per kWh. This is lower than the average Japanese residential rate of ~19.5 cents, which means that, in this simple case which skips the necessary time value of money calculation, PV has reached grid parity for residential users in Japan. = Reaching parity = Deciding whether or not PV is at grid parity is more complex than other sources, due to a side-effect of one of its main advantages. Compared to most sources, like wind turbines or hydro dams, PV can scale successfully to systems as small as one panel or as large as millions. In the case of small systems, they can be installed at the customer's location. In this case the LCOE competes against the retail price of grid power, which includes all upstream additions like transmission fees, taxes, etc. In the example above, grid parity has been reached in Nagano. However, retail prices are generally higher than wholesale prices, so grid parity may not have been reached for the very same system installed on the supply-side of the grid. In order to encompass all of these possibilities, Japan's NEDO defines the grid parity in three phases:Outline of the Roadmap PV2030+, NEDO, June 2009 (mostly in Japanese, but has an English summary from p. 17) * 1st phase grid parity: residential grid-connected PV systems * 2nd phase grid parity: industrial/transport/commercial sectors * 3rd phase grid parity: general power generation These categories are ranked in terms of the price of power they displace; residential power is more expensive than commercial wholesale. Thus, it is expected that the 1st phase would be reached earlier than the 3rd phase. Predictions from the 2006 time-frame expected retail grid parity for solar in the 2016 to 2020 era,Gaining on the grid Energy Information Administration, (November 2010). Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011 . but due to rapid downward pricing changes, more recent calculations have forced dramatic reductions in time scale, and the suggestion that solar has already reached grid parity in a wide variety of locations.K. Brankera, M.J.M. Pathaka, J.M. Pearce, \\"A review of solar photovoltaic levelized cost of electricity\\", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 15 Issue 9 (December 2011), pp. 4470-4482 The European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) calculated that PV would reach parity in many of the European countries by 2020, with costs declining to about half of those of 2010. However, this report was based on the prediction that prices would fall 36 to 51% between 2010 and 2020, a decrease that actually took place during the year the report was authored. The parity line was claimed to have been crossed in Australia in September 2011,\\"Solar industry celebrates grid parity\\", ABC News, 7 September 2011 and module prices have continued to fall since then. Stanwell Corporation, an electricity generator owned by the Queensland government made a loss in 2013 from its 4,000 MW of coal and gas fired generation. The company attributed this loss to the expansion of rooftop solar generation which reducing the price of electricity during the day, on some days the price per MWh (usually $40‚Äì$50 Australian dollars) was almost zero. The Australian Government and Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast the production of energy by rooftop solar to rise sixfold between 2014 and 2024. = Rapid uptake = Photovoltaics are since early-2010s starting to compete in some places without subsidies. Shi Zhengrong has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. As PV system prices decline it is inevitable that subsidies will end. \\"Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015\\". In fact, recent evidence suggest that photovoltaic grid parity has already been reached in countries of the Mediterranean basin (Cyprus). Predictions that a power source becomes self-supporting when parity is reached appear to be coming true. According to many measures, PV is the fastest growing source of power in the world: > For large-scale installations, prices below $1.00/watt are now common.

The dramatic price reductions in the PV industry have been causing a number of other power sources to become less interesting. Nevertheless, there remains the widespread belief that concentrating solar power (CSP) will be even less expensive than PV, although this is suitable for industrial-scale projects only, and thus has to compete at wholesale pricing. One company stated in 2011 that CSP costs $0.12/kWh to produce in Australia, and expects this to drop to $0.06/kWh by 2015 due to improvements in technology and reductions in equipment manufacturing costs. Greentech Media predicts that LCOE of CSP and PV power will lower to $0.07‚Äì$0.12/kWh by 2020 in California.Cost and LCOE by Generation Technology, 2009-2020, GTM Research, 2010  Wind power  Grid parity also applies to wind power where it varies according to wind quality and existing distribution infrastructure. ExxonMobil predicts wind power real cost will approach parity with natural gas and coal without carbon sequestration and be cheaper than natural gas and coal with carbon sequestration by 2025.ExxonMobil Corporation. \\"The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030\\". Retrieved 16 February 2011. Wind turbines reached grid parity in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.\\"Onshore wind to reach grid parity by 2016\\", BusinessGreen Nevertheless, a significant amount of the wind power resource in North America remains above grid parity due to the long transmission distances involved.

A typical picture does not resemble a random bitmap. In theoretical computer science, smoothed analysis is a way of measuring the complexity of an algorithm. Since its introduction in 2001, smoothed analysis has been used as a basis for considerable research, for problems ranging from mathematical programming, numerical analysis, machine learning, and data mining. It can give a more realistic analysis of the practical performance of the algorithm, such as its running time, than using worst-case or average-case scenarios. Smoothed analysis is a hybrid of worst-case and average-case analyses that inherits advantages of both. It measures the expected performance of algorithms under slight random perturbations of worst-case inputs. If the smoothed complexity of an algorithm is low, then it is unlikely that the algorithm will take a long time to solve practical instances whose data are subject to slight noises and imprecisions. Smoothed complexity results are strong probabilistic results, roughly stating that, in every large enough neighbourhood of the space of inputs, most inputs are easily solvable. Thus, a low smoothed complexity means that the hardness of inputs is a \\"brittle\\" property. Although worst-case analysis has been widely successful in explaining the practical performance of many algorithms, this style of analysis gives misleading results for a number of problems. Worst-case complexity measures the time it takes to solve any input, although hard-to-solve inputs might never come up in practice. In such cases, the worst-case running time can be much worse than the observed running time in practice. For example, the worst-case complexity of solving a linear program using the simplex algorithm is exponential, although the observed number of steps in practice is roughly linear. The simplex algorithm is in fact much faster than the ellipsoid method in practice, although the latter has polynomial-time worst-case complexity. Average-case analysis was first introduced to overcome the limitations of worst-case analysis. However, the resulting average-case complexity depends heavily on the probability distribution that is chosen over the input. The actual inputs and distribution of inputs may be different in practice from the assumptions made during the analysis: a random input may be very unlike a typical input. Because of this choice of data model, a theoretical average- case result might say little about practical performance of the algorithm. Smoothed analysis generalizes both worst-case and average-case analysis and inherits strengths of both. It is intended to be much more general than average-case complexity, while still allowing low complexity bounds to be proven. History ACM and the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science awarded the 2008 G√∂del Prize to Daniel Spielman and Shanghua Teng for developing smoothed analysis. In 2010 Spielman received the Nevanlinna Prize for developing smoothed analysis. Spielman and Teng's JACM paper \\"Smoothed analysis of algorithms: Why the simplex algorithm usually takes polynomial time\\" was also one of the three winners of the 2009 Fulkerson Prize sponsored jointly by the Mathematical Programming Society (MPS) and the American Mathematical Society (AMS). Examples =Simplex algorithm for linear programming= The simplex algorithm is a very efficient algorithm in practice, and it is one of the dominant algorithms for linear programming in practice. On practical problems, the number of steps taken by the algorithm is linear in the number of variables and constraints. Yet in the theoretical worst case it takes exponentially many steps for most successfully analyzed pivot rules. This was one of the main motivations for developing smoothed analysis. For the perturbation model, we assume that the input data is perturbed by noise from a Gaussian distribution. For normalization purposes, we assume the unperturbed data \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf A} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d}, \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf b} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\mathbf c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d satisfies \\\\(\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf a}_i, \\\\bar{b}_i)\\\\_2 \\\\leq 1 for all rows (\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf a}_i, \\\\bar{b}_i) of the matrix (\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf A}, \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf b}). The noise (\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf A}, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf b}) has independent entries sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation \\\\sigma. We set \\\\mathbf A = \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf A} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf A}, \\\\mathbf b = \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf b} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf b}. The smoothed input data consists of the linear program :maximize ::\\\\mathbf{c^T} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} :subject to ::\\\\mathbf A \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\leq \\\\mathbf b. If the running time of our algorithm on data \\\\mathbf A, \\\\mathbf b, \\\\mathbf c is given by T(\\\\mathbf A, \\\\mathbf b,\\\\mathbf c) then the smoothed complexity of the simplex method is ::C_s(n,d,\\\\sigma) := \\\\max_{\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf A}, \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf b}, \\\\mathbf c} ~ \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf A},\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf b}}[T(\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf A} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf A}, \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf b} + \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf b}, \\\\mathbf c)] = {\\\\rm poly}(d,\\\\log n, \\\\sigma^{-1}). This bound holds for a specific pivot rule called the shadow vertex rule. The shadow vertex rule is slower than more commonly used pivot rules such as Dantzig's rule or the steepest edge rule but it has properties that make it very well- suited to probabilistic analysis. =Local search for combinatorial optimization= A number of local search algorithms have bad worst-case running times but perform well in practice. One example is the 2-opt heuristic for the traveling salesman problem. It can take exponentially many iterations until it finds a locally optimal solution, although in practice the running time is subquadratic in the number of vertices. The approximation ratio, which is the ratio between the length of the output of the algorithm and the length of the optimal solution, tends to be good in practice but can also be bad in the theoretical worst case. One class of problem instances can be given by n points in the box [0,1]^d, where their pairwise distances come from a norm. Already in two dimensions, the 2-opt heuristic might take exponentially many iterations until finding a local optimum. In this setting, one can analyze the perturbation model where the vertices v_1,\\\\dots,v_n are independently sampled according to probability distributions with probability density function f_1,\\\\dots,f_n : [0,1]^d \\\\rightarrow [0,\\\\theta]. For \\\\theta = 1, the points are uniformly distributed. When \\\\theta > 1 is big, the adversary has more ability to increase the likelihood of hard problem instances. In this perturbation model, the expected number of iterations of the 2-opt heuristic, as well as the approximation ratios of resulting output, are bounded by polynomial functions of n and \\\\theta. Another local search algorithm for which smoothed analysis was successful is Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering. Given n points in [0,1]^d, it is NP-hard to find a good partition into clusters with small pairwise distances between points in the same cluster. Lloyd's algorithm is widely used and very fast in practice, although it can take e^{\\\\Omega(n)} iterations in the worst case to find a locally optimal solution. However, assuming that the points have independent Gaussian distributions, each with expectation in [0,1]^d and standard deviation \\\\sigma, the expected number of iterations of the algorithm is bounded by a polynomial in n, d and \\\\sigma.

It gains both its common and scientific name from its propensity to turn black from cutting or bruising. It is edible but of indifferent quality. Taxonomy It is placed in the Compactae group, subsection Nigricantinae by Bon. It was first described by the French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1798 as Agaricus nigricans, before gaining its current binomial name from the father of mycology, the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. Its specific epithet is the Latin nigricans 'blackening'. Description This is a large member of the genus Russula, and it has a cap that is dirty white when young, but swiftly turns brown, and then black on aging. It measures in diameter. There is usually a large depression in the centre of mature caps, which are three quarter peeling. The stem is white; firm; straight, and thick, and it too blackens with age. The gills are off-white initially, very widely spaced, and are adnate. These turn red; then grey, and finally black, when bruised. The flesh, which has a fruity smell, when cut turns pale Indian red, and then grey, and black within 20 minutes. The spore print is white, and the warty oval spores measure 7‚Äì8 x 6‚Äì7 Œºm. Old specimens are sometimes parasitised by fungi of the genus Asterophora or Nyctalis, in particular the species N. parasitica and N. asterophora (the pick-a-back toadstool). Distribution and habitat Russula nigricans appears in late summer and autumn in both deciduous and coniferous woodland across Britain, Northern Europe, and at least the East Coast of North America. Edibility This mushroom is edible, but poor. The taste becomes hot over time. Similar species Russula anthracina (Romagn.), also known as R. albonigra (Krombh.) Fries, has closer gills and is far less common. It lacks the red phase of colouration when the flesh is cut.

There is evidence that, on a population level, intelligence is negatively correlated with fertility rate and positively correlated with survival rate of offspring.Literacy, Education and Fertility, Past and Present: A Critical Review, Harvey J. Graff The combined net effect of these two conflicting forces on ultimate population intelligence is not well studied and is unclear. It is theorized that if an inverse correlation of IQ with fertility rate were stronger than the correlation of IQ with survival rate (and if heritable factors involved in IQ were consistently expressed in populations with different fertility rates), assuming this continued over a significant number of generations, it could lead to a decrease in population IQ scores. The Flynn effect demonstrates an increase in phenotypic IQ scores over time, but confounding environmental factors during the same period of time preclude any conclusion concerning underlying change in genotypic IQ. Other correlates of IQ include income and educational attainment, which are also fertility factors that are inversely correlated with fertility rate, and are to some degree heritable. Although fertility measures offspring per woman, if one needs to predict population-level changes, the average age of motherhood also needs to be considered, with lower age of motherhood potentially having a greater effect than fertility rate. (For example, a subpopulation with fertility rate of 4 with average age of reproduction at 40 years old, generally speaking, will have relatively less genotypical growth than a subpopulation with fertility rate of 3 but average age of reproduction at 20 years old.) Early views and research The negative correlation between fertility and intelligence (as measured by IQ) has been argued to have existed in many parts of the world. Early studies, however, were \\"superficial and illusory\\" and not clearly supported by the limited data they collected. Some of the first studies into the subject were carried out on individuals living before the advent of IQ testing, in the late 19th century, by looking at the fertility of men listed in Who's Who, these individuals being presumably of high intelligence. These men, taken as a whole, had few children, implying a correlation.Huntington, E., & Whitney, L. The Builders of America. New York: Morrow, 1927.Kirk, Dudley. 'The fertility of a gifted group: A study of the number of children of men in WHO'S WHO.' In The Nature and Transmission of the Genetic and Cultural Characteristics of Human Populations. New York: Milbank Memorial Fund, 1957, pp.78‚Äì98. Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist William Shockley controversially argued from the mid-1960s through the 1980s that \\"the future of the population was threatened because people with low IQs had more children than those with high IQs.\\"William Shockley, Roger Pearson: Shockley on Eugenics and Race: The Application of Science to the Solution of Human Problems Scott-Townsend Publishers, In 1963, Weyl and Possony asserted that comparatively small differences in average intelligence can become very large differences in the very high IQ ranges. A decline in average psychometric intelligence of only a few points will mean a much smaller population of gifted individuals.Weyl, N. & Possony, S. T: The Geography of Intellect, 1963, s. 154 More rigorous studies carried out on Americans alive after the Second World War returned different results suggesting a slight positive correlation with respect to intelligence. The findings from these investigations were consistent enough for Osborn and Bajema, writing as late as 1972, to conclude that fertility patterns were eugenic, and that \\"the reproductive trend toward an increase in the frequency of genes associated with higher IQ... will probably continue in the foreseeable future in the United States and will be found also in other industrial welfare-state democracies.\\" Several reviewers considered the findings premature, arguing that the samples were nationally unrepresentative, generally being confined to whites born between 1910 and 1940 in the Great Lakes States. Other researchers began to report a negative correlation in the 1960s after two decades of neutral or positive fertility. In 1982, Daniel R. Vining, Jr. sought to address these issues in a large study on the fertility of over 10,000 individuals throughout the United States, who were then aged 25 to 34. The average fertility in his study was correlated at ‚àí0.86 with IQ for white women and ‚àí0.96 for black women. Vining argued that this indicated a drop in the genotypic average IQ of 1.6 points per generation for the white population, and 2.4 points per generation for the black population. In considering these results along with those from earlier researchers, Vining wrote that \\"in periods of rising birth rates, persons with higher intelligence tend to have fertility equal to, if not exceeding, that of the population as a whole,\\" but, \\"The recent decline in fertility thus seems to have restored the dysgenic trend observed for a comparable period of falling fertility between 1850 and 1940.\\" To address the concern that the fertility of this sample could not be considered complete, Vining carried out a follow-up study for the same sample 18 years later, reporting the same, though slightly decreased, negative correlation between IQ and fertility. Later research In a 1988 study, Retherford and Sewell examined the association between the measured intelligence and fertility of over 9,000 high school graduates in Wisconsin in 1957, and confirmed the inverse relationship between IQ and fertility for both sexes, but much more so for females. If children had, on average, the same IQ as their parents, IQ would decline by .81 points per generation. Taking .71 for the additive heritability of IQ as given by Jinks and Fulker, they calculated a dysgenic decline of .57 IQ points per generation. Another way of checking the negative relationship between IQ and fertility is to consider the relationship which educational attainment has to fertility, since education is known to be a reasonable proxy for IQ, correlating with IQ at .55; in a 1999 study examining the relationship between IQ and education in a large national sample, David Rowe and others found not only that achieved education had a high heritability (.68) and that half of the variance in education was explained by an underlying genetic component shared by IQ, education, and SES. One study investigating fertility and education carried out in 1991 found that high school dropouts in the United States had the most children (2.5 on average), with high school graduates having fewer children, and college graduates having the fewest children (1.56 on average).Bachu, Amara. 1991. Fertility of American Women: June 1990. U.S. Bureau of the Census. Current Population Report Series P-20, No. 454. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office. The Bell Curve (1994) argued that the average genotypic IQ of the United States was declining due to both dysgenetic fertility and large scale immigration of groups with low average IQ. In a 1999 study Richard Lynn examined the relationship between the intelligence of adults aged 40 and above and their numbers of children and their siblings. Data was collected from a 1994 National Opinion Research Center survey among a representative sample of 2992 English-speaking individuals aged 18 years. He found negative correlations between the intelligence of American adults and the number of children and siblings that they had, but only for females. He also reported that there was virtually no correlation between women's intelligence and the number of children they considered ideal. In 2004 Lynn and Marian Van Court attempted a straightforward replication of Vining's work. Their study returned similar results, with the genotypic decline measuring at 0.9 IQ points per generation for the total sample and 0.75 IQ points for whites only. Boutwell et al. (2013) reported a strong negative association between county-level IQ and county-level fertility rates in the United States. A 2014 study by Satoshi Kanazawa using data from the National Child Development Study found that more intelligent women and men were more likely to want to be childless, but that only more intelligent women ‚Äì not men ‚Äì were more likely to actually be childless. International research Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the Population Reference Bureau Although much of the research into intelligence and fertility has been restricted to individuals within a single nation (usually the United States), Steven Shatz (2008) extended the research internationally; he finds that \\"There is a strong tendency for countries with lower national IQ scores to have higher fertility rates and for countries with higher national IQ scores to have lower fertility rates.\\" Lynn and Harvey (2008) found a correlation of ‚àí0.73 between national IQ and fertility. They estimated that the effect had been \\"a decline in the world's genotypic IQ of 0.86 IQ points for the years 1950‚Äì2000. A further decline of 1.28 IQ points in the world's genotypic IQ is projected for the years 2000‚Äì2050.\\" In the first period this effect had been compensated for by the Flynn effect causing a rise in phenotypic IQ but recent studies in four developed nations had found it has now ceased or gone into reverse. They thought it probable that both genotypic and phenotypic IQ will gradually start to decline for the whole world. Possible causes =Income= A theory to explain the fertility-intelligence relationship is that while income and IQ are positively correlated, income is also in itself a fertility factor that correlates inversely with fertility, that is, the higher the incomes, the lower the fertility rates and vice versa. There is thus an inverse correlation between income and fertility within and between nations. The higher the level of education and GDP per capita of a human population, sub-population or social stratum, the fewer children are born. In a 1974 UN population conference in Bucharest, Karan Singh, a former minister of population in India, encapsulated this relationship by stating \\"Development is the best contraceptive\\". =Education= People often delay childbearing in order to spend more time getting education, and thus have fewer children. Conversely, early childbearing can interfere with education, so those with early or frequent childbearing are likely to be less educated. While education and childbearing place competing demands on a person's resources, education is positively correlated with IQ. =Birth control and intelligence= Among a sample of women using birth control methods of comparable theoretical effectiveness, success rates were related to IQ, with the percentages of high, medium and low IQ women having unwanted births during a three-year interval being 3%, 8% and 11%, respectively. Since the effectiveness of many methods of birth control is directly correlated with proper usage, an alternative interpretation of the data would indicate lower IQ women were less likely to use birth control consistently and correctly. Another study found that after an unwanted pregnancy has occurred, higher IQ couples are more likely to obtain abortions; and unmarried teenage girls who become pregnant are found to be more likely to carry their babies to term if they are doing poorly in school. Conversely, while desired family size in the United States is apparently the same for women of all IQ levels, highly educated women are found to be more likely to say that they desire more children than they have, indicating a \\"deficit fertility\\" in the highly intelligent. In her review of reproductive trends in the United States, Van Court argues that \\"each factor ‚Äì from initially employing some form of contraception, to successful implementation of the method, to termination of an accidental pregnancy when it occurs ‚Äì involves selection against intelligence.\\" =Criticisms= While it may seem obvious that such differences in fertility would result in a progressive change of IQ, Preston and Campbell (1993) argued that this is a mathematical fallacy that applies only when looking at closed subpopulations. In their mathematical model, with constant differences in fertility, since children's IQ can be more or less than that of their parents, a steady-state equilibrium is argued to be established between different subpopulations with different IQ. The mean IQ will not change in the absence of a change of the fertility differences. The steady-state IQ distribution will be lower for negative differential fertility than for positive, but these differences are small. For the extreme and unrealistic assumption of endogamous mating in IQ subgroups, a differential fertility change of 2.5/1.5 to 1.5/2.5 (high IQ/low IQ) causes a maximum shift of four IQ points. For random mating, the shift is less than one IQ point. James S. Coleman, however, argues that Preston and Campbell's model depends on assumptions which are unlikely to be true. The general increase in IQ test scores, the Flynn effect, has been argued to be evidence against dysgenic arguments. Geneticist Steve Connor wrote that Lynn, writing in Dysgenics: Genetic Deterioration in Modern Populations, \\"misunderstood modern ideas of genetics.\\" \\"A flaw in his argument of genetic deterioration in intelligence was the widely accepted fact that intelligence as measured by IQ tests has actually increased over the past 50 years.\\" If the genes causing IQ have been adversely affected, IQ scores should reasonably be expected to change in the same direction, yet the reverse has occurred. However, it has been argued that genotypic IQ may decrease even while phenotypic IQ rises throughout the population due to environmental effects such as better nutrition and education. The Flynn effect may now have ended or reversed in some developed nations. Some of the studies looking at relation between IQ and fertility cover the fertility of individuals who have attained a particular age, thereby ignoring positive correlation between IQ and survival. To make conclusions about effects on IQ of future populations, such effects would have to be taken into account. Recent research has shown that education and socioeconomic status are better indicators of fertility and suggests that the relationship between intelligence and number of children may be spurious. When controlling for education and socioeconomic status, the relationship between intelligence and number of children, intelligence and number of siblings, and intelligence and ideal number of children reduces to statistical insignificance. Among women, a post-hoc analysis revealed that the lowest and highest intelligence scores did not differ significantly by number of children.Macon Paul Parker, Intelligence and Dysgenic Fertility: Re- specification and Reanalysis, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b06d/ef636edc0c062f687e54659ae805a8c4c793.pdf However, socioeconomic status and (obviously) education are themselves not independent of intelligence. Other research suggest that siblings born further apart achieve higher educational outcomes. Therefore, sibling density, not number of siblings, may explain the negative association between IQ and number of siblings. Other traits A study by the Institute of Psychiatry determined that men with higher IQ's tend to have better quality sperm than lower IQ males, even when considering age and lifestyle, stating that the genes underlying intelligence may be multi-factored.

Bourgeois played all outfield positions and second base in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, Tampa Bay Rays and Cincinnati Reds. Amateur career Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Bourgeois was teammates with fellow MLB outfielders Carl Crawford and Michael Bourn on a little league team that won the state championship. Bourgeois would later go on to attend Forest Brook High School. During his senior year at Forest Brook, Bourgeois hit .553 with 4 home runs, 43 runs batted in, and 24 stolen bases.https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/Justice-Bourgeois- gets-a-shot-with-hometown- team-1716772.phphttp://www.baseballamerica.com/online/draft/prospects/jbourgeois.html Professional career =Texas Rangers= Bourgeois was drafted as a shortstop in the second round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Texas Rangers. =Atlanta Braves= He played in the Rangers organization until the Atlanta Braves claimed him off waivers on March 23, 2005. =Seattle Mariners= His stay in Atlanta was short, however, as the Seattle Mariners selected Bourgeois in the Rule 5 Draft on December 8, 2005. Becomes free agent after season =Chicago White Sox= On December 19, 2006, he signed a contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was recalled by the Chicago White Sox on September 6, , and made his major league debut on September 9. Bourgeois is the last player to get his first major league hit at the original Yankee Stadium. =Milwaukee Brewers= On November 24, 2008, the Milwaukee Brewers signed Bourgeois to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training. He was assigned to play for with the Nashville Sounds of the Triple A Pacific Coast League. On August 12, 2009, he was called to play for the Brewers to replace Bill Hall, who was designated for assignment.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090812&content;_id=6386934&vkey;=news_mlb&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=mlb This would be the first of two times that Bourgeois would replace Bill Hall on a Major League roster. The second came on June 4, 2011, when the Houston Astros released Hall after activating Bourgeois from the disabled list. =Houston Astros= Bourgeois was claimed off waivers by the Houston Astros on October 26, 2009. On January 20, 2010, Bourgeois, who was designated for assignment by the Astros, accepted his assignment to Triple A Round Rock after clearing waivers. On June 20, 2010, Bourgeois, Jason Castro and Chris Johnson were added to the major league roster and Casey Daigle, Cory Sullivan and Kevin Cash were designated for assignment. Bourgeois played in 69 games for the Astros that year, including making twelve starts in September and October after starting center fielder Michael Bourn was injured. On April 30, 2011, Bourgeois earned his first career walk-off win with a single to left field in the bottom of the ninth inning scoring Bill Hall (who pinch ran for Brett Wallace after he reached base on a walk earlier that inning) from second base to lead the Astros to a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Bourgeous had the other run in that game. Overall, it was a breakout game for Bourgeois as he had a game high three hits (two singles and a double). He also had two stolen bases (second and third consecutively) in the first inning, and would later come home and score a run that inning on a Hunter Pence RBI single. Later that year on September 11th he would hit his first major league home run. =Kansas City Royals= On March 20, 2012, Bourgeois was traded to the Kansas City Royals along with Humberto Quintero for minor leaguer Kevin Chapman and a player to be named later.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120320&content;_id=27437110&vkey;=news_mlb&c;_id=mlb He appeared in thirty games for the Royals during the 2012 season, batting .258 with five RBI and five stolen bases. Most of his season was spent with the Triple A affiliate Omaha Royals, where he had a .243 batting average with three home runs, eight RBI and seven stolen bases. On November 2, 2012 the Royals designated Bourgeois for assignment. After clearing waivers, he elected to become a free agent on November 12. =Tampa Bay Rays= In early December, 2012 the Rays signed Bourgeois to a minor league contract, with no guaranteed invite to Spring Training. Bourgeois played most of his season with the Triple A Durham Bulls. On August 14, playing only his sixth game for the Rays after being called up, Bourgeois hit a walk-off RBI single to help the Rays defeat the Seattle Mariners. He was designated for assignment on August 23, 2013. =Cincinnati Reds= On November 5, 2013, Bourgeois signed with the Cincinnati Reds with an invite to Spring Training. On September 1, 2014, the Reds selected Bourgeois' contract from AA Chattanooga =Arizona Diamondbacks= On December 21, 2015, Bourgeois signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. =Chicago White Sox= Bourgeois was traded from the Diamondbacks the Chicago White Sox on May 16, 2016. On January 17, 2017 Bourgeois was resigned by the White Sox. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =Tigres de Quintana Roo= On December 4, 2017, Bourgeois signed with the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican Baseball League.

The first radio broadcast was in the autumn of 1951.http://www.hillbilly-music.com/programs/story/index.php?prog=170 Promoter William B. Wagnon, Jr., had been booking such acts as Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys in ballrooms between Bakersfield and Sacramento for several years when he decided to extend his operations to Los Angeles. Burt \\"Foreman\\" Phillips had been promoting country and Western barn dance programs at the old Town Hall building, situated at 400 South Long Beach Boulevard in Compton, near Long Beach. Wagnon acquired Phillips' lease and commenced promoting a combined dance-and-show, featuring any and all country & western recording artists working in the area and available on Saturday nights. An estimated 3,000 patrons could be accommodated in the Town Hall Ballroom.The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Compiled by staff of the Country Music Hall of Fame. 1998. Oxford University Press. page 542. Wagnon instructed the performers to play only music which could be danced to, and to keep individual songs short and plentiful, in order to satisfy everyone's tastes.Bond, Johnny. Reflections 1976, JEFM Press. NBC radio broadcasts A Friday night radio version of Town Hall Party was heard on KXLA, and Wagnon approached KFI with a proposal for a Saturday night broadcast. The latter was carried by portions of the NBC Radio network. Country singer Wesley Tuttle was hired as director/musical director of the series, and Johnny Bond was contracted to write the scripts for the KFI/NBC series. The cast featured Tex Ritter, Johnny Bond, Buddy Dooly, Wesley and Marilyn Tuttle, Tex Williams, Roy Klein, Joe Maphis, Rose Lee Maphis, Jenks \\"Tex\\" Carman, Eddie Kirk, Jim Pruitt, Merle Travis, Fiddlin' Kate (Margie Warren), Freddie Hart, Mary Jane Johnson, Les \\"Carrot-Top\\" Anderson, Pee Wee Adams, Shirley Adams, comedian Texas Tiny, and other prominent country entertainers. Radio announcer Jay Stewart, who had worked with Bond on an earlier West Coast country & western show, Hollywood Barn Dance, was hired as master of ceremonies.Bond, Johnny. The Tex Ritter Story 1976 Chappell. KTTV telecasts From 10:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. PT on Saturday nights, Los Angeles television station KTTV carried the live Town Hall Party series. By September 1953 the show was \\"a regional NBC TV'er,\\" and \\"the longest c.&w.; West Coast TV'er, with net plans in the works.Billboard Sep 26, 1953 page 52 The Armed Forces Television Service made 16mm kinescopes of the shows and broadcast them on stations throughout the world, from Greenland to Saudi Arabia to the Canal Zone. As the show expanded, new talent joined the cast - with Lefty Frizzell, Skeets McDonald, Dortha Wright, and The Collins Kids being among the most popular. Guest stars were plentiful. Eddie Dean, Smiley Burnette, Jimmy Wakely, Sons of the Pioneers, Johnny Cash, Jim Reeves and many other big names made guest appearances on the program, with Gene Autry breaking all attendance records during a 1954 performance. The 10-piece Town Hall Party band featured Joe Maphis, Merle Travis, superb steel guitarist Marian Hall, Billy Hill and Fiddlin' Kate on violins, PeeWee Adams on drums, Jimmy Pruitt on piano, and other excellent musicians who created a Town Hall Party sound also heard on many country sessions produced by Columbia Records in Hollywood in the 1950s.Country Song Round-Up, Number 33, July‚ÄìAugust, 1954. Ranch Party Wagnon's series continued to expand in the 1950s. Billed as Town Hall Ranch Party, Sunday afternoon and holiday performances were held outdoors at Sierra Creek Park in the Santa Monica Mountains beginning in the summer of 1955.Billboard Jul 30, 1955. page 20 A daily version began airing on another Los Angeles television station. Then, in 1957, Wagnon arranged with Screen Gems to film a series of 39 half-hour television shows featuring the Town Hall Party cast. A close friend of Art Linkletter, Wagnon had named his series after Linkletter's popular radio/television program, House Party. He opted to capitalize on the TV Westerns craze of 1957 by calling the syndicated series, Ranch Party. While many traditional country and Western musicians had been mainstays of the radio and television cast for years, the series readily embraced rock ¬¥n roll and enthusiastically presented singers from the new genre. Carl Perkins and his combo were brought in to film guest spots on the Screen Gems series, and The Collins Kids were given co-star billing with host Tex Ritter. Traditional country entertainers, singing cowboys, and rock singers never shared the spotlight in a more harmonious manner than on the Town Hall Party and syndicated Ranch Party shows.Bond, Johnny. Reflections, 1976, JEMF Press. 1958 to 1961 Columbia Records released a Town Hall Party LP album in 1958, featuring many of the regular cast members of the series. That same year, however, brought changes to the program. NBC radio had discontinued carrying the Saturday night shows, and rising union scale rates made it impossible for Wagnon to keep the huge cast of recording artists on the Compton stage week after week. The band was made smaller and many regular cast members departed in 1958. Billy Mize and Cliff Crofford, talented vocalists/instrumentalists/composers, joined the much smaller cast as band members and soloists. The Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team began playing in Los Angeles in April 1958, drawing many Town Hall patrons to the nearby Coliseum. In 1959 the new Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series.Tex Ritter Story. Johnny Bond. p 169http://mlb.mlb.com/la/history/timeline.jsp In late December 1958 the newly opened Showboat Hotel in Las Vegas began to put on Town Hall Party shows featuring Tex Ritter, The Collins Kids, and Town Hall regulars, thus drawing them away from the KTTV Saturday night telecasts. Competition for television viewers was more intense as the new decade began, and KTTV gave notice that Town Hall Party was to be dropped in December, 1960. The final performance at the Compton Town Hall was on January 14, 1961. Other live country and Western music shows were seen on California television at various points in the 1960s, but none featured the large cast of recording artists which Wagnon assembled in the 1950s, glimpses of which may be seen today on films of the syndicated Ranch Party series and on DVD releases of the surviving kinescopes of Town Hall Party.Bond, Johnny.

Through PatientsLikeMe, a growing community of more than 830,000 people with over 2,900 conditions share personal stories and information about their health, symptoms, and treatments, with a goal to improve the lives of all patients through knowledge derived from shared real-world experiences and outcomes. Data generated by patients themselves are systemically collected and quantified while also providing an environment for peer support and learning. These data capture the complex temporality and competing influences of different lifestyle choices, socio-demographics, conditions, and treatments on a person‚Äôs health. Everything members share empowers the community with personal agency, establishing PLM as a clinically robust resource with demonstrated impact, including more than 100 studies in peer-reviewed medical and scientific journals. History PatientsLikeMe was inspired by the life experiences of Stephen Heywood, diagnosed in 1998 at the age of 29 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease. The company was founded in 2004 by his brothers Jamie and Ben Heywood and long-time family friend Jeff Cole. After being diagnosed with ALS, Stephen's family founded a non-profit, ALS Therapy Development Institute, in an attempt to slow his disease and treat his symptoms. However, the slow pace of research and the trial-and-error approach was time-consuming and repetitive. They realized that Stephen's experience was like that of other patients around the world who often have specific questions about their treatment options, and about what to expect. PatientsLikeMe was created to help patients connect with others who know firsthand what they are going through to share advice and resources. Through a health profile made up of structured and quantitative clinical reporting tools, members are able to monitor their health between doctor or hospital visits, document the severity of their symptoms, identify triggers, note how they are responding to new treatments, and track side effects. They have the opportunity to learn from the aggregated data of others with the same disease and see how they are doing in context with others. Members of the site use social tools such as forums, private messages, and profile comments to give and receive support from others, a support mechanism that has been shown to help improve their management and perceived control. In 2017, PatientsLikeMe entered into a partnership with iCarbonX to apply next generation biological measures and machine learning to understand more about the basis of human health and disease. iCarbonX, founded in 2015 by renowned genomicist Jun Wang, took an equity position in PatientsLikeMe and provided multi-omics characterization services to the company. In 2019, PatientsLikeMe was acquired by UnitedHealth Group. In 2020, PatientsLikeMe began to operate as an independent company backed by Optum Ventures, a UnitedHealth Group affiliate. Expansion beyond ALS PatientsLikeMe launched its first online community for ALS patients in 2006. From there, the company began adding other communities for other life-changing conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, HIV, chronic fatigue syndrome, mood disorders, epilepsy, organ transplantation, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and Devic's disease (neuromyelitis optica). The company's approach was to read the scientific literature and listen to patients to identify outcome measures, symptoms, and treatments that were important to patients and could be accurately reported. For example, the development of the MS community involved the development of a new patient reported outcome measure, the MS Rating Scale (MSRS), to ensure patients could accurately determine how their condition was progressing over time. However, building one community at a time was a slow process and the company risked being overly narrow in focus while excluding more than 5,000 patients who had requested new communities as of December 2010. In April 2011, the company expanded its scope and opened its doors to any patient with any condition.PatientsLikeMe Calls All Patients With Any Condition to Join Today the website covers more than 2,900 health conditions, with new members joining daily from the US and other countries around the world. Of note are the nearly 14,000 ALS members, who have helped make PatientsLikeMe's flagship community the largest online population of ALS patients in the world. In the United States, approximately 10 percent of newly diagnosed ALS patients register on the site each month, and 2 percent of all multiple sclerosis patients in the US participate in the community.  Impact of companies like PatientsLikeMe  According to the findings in a research study conducted in 2010, long term prognosis of physical illnesses can be predicted by emotional well-being, which suggests that the improvement of the prognosis of physical illnesses may be enhanced by emotional well-being. Survival rates and recovery from physically diseased patients, benefit from higher levels of emotional well- being. Platforms that allow patients to interact with other patients can provide the emotional support that is still a missing piece of the patient‚Äôs experience within the healthcare system. The natural development of emotional support from patient-to-patient connections could enhance emotional well- being, and therefore aid patients through recovery, or acceptance of what can follow.  Products and services  =Online data-sharing platform= PatientsLikeMe allows members to input real-world data on their conditions, treatment history, side effects, hospitalizations, symptoms, disease-specific functional scores, weight, mood, quality of life and more on an ongoing basis. The result is a detailed longitudinal record ‚Äì organized into charts and graphs ‚Äì that allows patients to gain insight and identify patterns. The data- sharing platform is designed to help patients answer the question: ‚ÄúGiven my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?‚Äù. Answers come in the form of shared longitudinal data from other patients with the same condition(s), thus allowing members to place their experiences in context and see what treatments have helped other patients like them. Some communities, such as ALS, feature visual aids such as percentile curves on the patient profile, so that an individual user can see whether their rate of progression is fast, slow, or about average. A seizure tracker for patients with epilepsy helps identify triggers such as missed medication doses, sleep deprivation, or alcohol use, and a \\"mood map\\" for patients with mood disorders helps to show different factors underlying their condition such as emotional control, anxiety, or external stress while all users can look for patterns in their daily health status such as day of the week or time of day. On top of patients being able to organize their treatment, better understand and control their disease, they can access a beneficial psycho-social support network. Patients can share with their peers who have had or are going through similar experiences. Diagnosis of a long-term illness can be socially isolating as the patient is usually the only one in their family or friend group going through it. There is an experience gap between people who are diagnosed with cancer (or other long-term illness) and the ones who are not. Being social animals, this isolation often leads to anxiety and depression (related to diagnosis) which are known to undermine treatment and patient outcomes. On relation to various cancers, peer support groups of \\"others who have had the same or similar experiences\\" have been linked to reduced symptoms of depression, increase patient compliance to treatment regimens and increased survival outcomes. Three studies have been published suggesting that use of the platform improves patient outcomes. A survey conducted in 2010 amongst patients with ALS, MS, Parkinson's disease, HIV, fibromyalgia, and mood disorders found that 72% of users had found the site helpful in learning about a symptom they had experienced, 57% for understanding the side effects of a treatment, 42% in helping them to find another patient like them, amongst others. A second study conducted in epilepsy found that in addition to the earlier benefits reported, patients with epilepsy reported a better understanding of their symptoms (59%), seizures (58%), and symptoms or treatments (55%). The number of benefits they reported from using the site was strongly associated with the number of social connections they made with other members, dubbed the \\"dose effect curve of friendship\\". Finally, a third study conducted with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and the University of California at San Francisco reported statistically significant improvements in validated measures of self-management and self-efficacy in veterans with epilepsy as a result of engaging with the site for a period of six weeks. =Health economics and outcomes research= One of the ways in which the site makes revenue is by conducting scientific research studies for pharmaceutical companies, typically with an emphasis on issues that are important to both patients and industry. In 2011 a partnership with Novartis studied the barriers faced by people with multiple sclerosis in being adherent to taking their medication, which led to the development of an MS Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) which was made available to help patients and their doctors identify and address these issues through coping strategies and enhanced communication. A 2013 collaboration with UCB explored factors underlying quality of life in epilepsy and identified a number of issues beyond the occurrence of seizures as being important, including symptoms such as problems concentrating, depression, memory problems, and treatment side effects. In 2015 PatientsLikeMe worked with researchers at Genentech on a study inviting potential clinical trial participants to review study protocols in order to provide input and feedback to make the study more appealing. A 2016 collaboration with Novartis published in Nature Biotechnology and Value in Health explored ways in which patients could provide systematic input into guiding drug development to help make it more patient-centered. A different study published with AstraZeneca in 2016 sought to understand the treatment expectations of women living with ovarian cancer and identified a shift from surviving with the condition to living with it. Such research helps to improve understanding of disease, identify new approaches to management, and generate ideas to improve the products and services developed by pharmaceutical companies. =Open Research Exchange= Following the award in 2013 and 2014 of $4.5m in grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the company developed an online tool called the Open Research Exchange (ORE) that allowed for the rapid creation, prototyping, testing, and validation of patient reported outcome measures, questionnaires that can establish the impact of symptoms and disease on patients. During the period of the grant, a number of academic collaborators were invited to develop measures on the platform including measures of treatment burden, hypertension management, feelings of satiety in diabetes and treatment burden in chronic illness. The tool offers researchers the ability to rapidly get input from large numbers of patients in a matter of weeks or months as opposed to much slower forms of research which can take years to complete. A number of tools such as the Treatment Burden Questionnaire and the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT) have been published in the scientific literature for use by researchers and an editorial co-authored with industry leaders and a researcher at the FDA outlined ways in which PROs developed on the ORE could be used for the development of new medicines. In addition to the traditional scientist-lead instruments, one instrument was developed by a person living with MS. A 2016 RWJF grant for $900,000 charters PatientsLikeMe to work with the National Quality Forum to develop new measures for healthcare performance. Scientific work A key differentiator of the site from more traditional online support groups, message boards, social media sites and list-serves is the emphasis on structured quantitative data which can be aggregated and used for research purposes. This has permitted PatientsLikeMe's research team to author more than 100 peer-reviewed published scientific articles in collaboration with academic and commercial partners in leading journals such as the BMJ, Nature Biotechnology, and Neurology. In addition, PatientsLikeMe has been mentioned by others in more than 3,000 published articles in the scientific literature and has been featured as a business case study by the Harvard Business Review. The company has also invited researchers to become embedded with the company such as an in-depth study explaining the organization of the platform and highlighting some of the challenges that social media and patient-centred research models are facing. Wherever possible, PatientsLikeMe has a policy of publishing its research output in open access form, so that patients, clinicians, and researchers can easily access their scientific output. Instruments and questionnaires developed on PatientsLikeMe such as the MS Rating Scale or MS Treatment Adherence Questionnaire are licensed under Creative Commons so that they can be used freely by the community without complex or costly licensing requirements. The company also provides patients that take part in its studies with \\"givebacks\\" which concisely and rapidly give them feedback in lay language as to the results of research in which they have participated so they can understand how donating their data has been useful for research. The company's best known scientific endeavor relates to an online refutation of a clinical trial in ALS. In 2008, a small Italian study was published suggesting that lithium carbonate could slow the progression of ALS. In response, hundreds of members of PatientsLikeMe with the disease began taking the drug off-label. Using the self-reported data of 348 ALS patients and taking just nine months to complete, PatientsLikeMe conducted a study which demonstrated that lithium did not slow the progress of the disease. The team suggested that online collection of patient self-report data was no substitute for randomized placebo-controlled trials, but it might be a useful new form of clinical research in certain circumstances. A later study described how patients attempted to use the same tools to unblind clinical trials in which they were enrolled to try and see whether or not the experimental drugs they were taking were working. A 2016 collaboration with Dr Rick Bedlack of the Duke ALS Clinic aims to overcome some of the burden of traditional ALS trials by allowing patients to take part in a clinical trial of a nutritional supplement, Lunasin, from their own home with just two clinic visits rather than regular monthly appointments. Participants completed ‚Äúvirtual visits‚Äù to record their ALSFRS-R and other health information in between initial and final on-site visits. Synthetic controls were matched to the intervention arm based on demographics and similarity scores of disease progression using algorithms developed at PLM that analyzed longitudinal ALSFRS-R data from the existing PLM population. This enabled clinicians to effectively power their study while further reducing on-site visits. This virtual model has resulted in fast and effective trial recruitment, retention, and adherence. Led by PLM, recruitment of trial participants for Duke was achieved in less than half the expected time. For the second ongoing study, PLM members are being recruited utilizing algorithms to identify individuals predicted to have similar progression. The intervention arm is invited to participate virtually for all aspects of the trial while combination of historic and newly generated untreated individuals will serve as the control arms. These cohorts with similar expected rates of progression reduce the total number of participants required to determine treatment efficacy. Corporate affairs and culture =Business model= Describing itself ‚Äúa not just for profit,‚Äù PatientsLikeMe does not allow advertising on its site but rather keeps the site free for users by selling research services as well as aggregated, de-identified data to its partners, including pharmaceutical companies and medical device makers. Typical commercial services include helping to optimize the designs of clinical trial protocols, developing new patient reported outcomes, or identifying the severity of symptoms in specific patient groups. The company enforces transparency about who uses the data and partners have included most of the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide such as UCB, Novartis, Sanofi, Avanir Pharmaceuticals and Acorda Therapeutics. Awards and recognition In 2007 the company was named as one of the \\"15 Companies that Will Change the World\\" by Business 2.0 and CNN Money as well as added to the list of \\"Top Health IT Innovators\\" by FierceHealthIT . In 2008 PatientsLikeMe received the Prix Ars Electronica Award of Distinction and in March featured in a New York Times Magazine article entitled \\"Practicing Patients\\", by Thomas Goetz, who later went on to feature the site in his book \\"The Decision Tree\\". Later in 2008 a television segment with Sanjay Gupta aired on the CBS Evening News. Fast Company (magazine)'s 2010 list of Most Innovative Companies ranked PatientsLikeMe at #23. A May 2010 New York Times article entitled \\"When Patients Meet Online‚Äù, outlined the potential for advances for research. In 2012 Sanjay Gupta featured a research project conducted in collaboration with PatientsLikeMe on CNN's The Next List, profiling collaborator Dr Max Little. In January 2013, the company featured as a clue on Jeopardy! - \\"A health data-sharing platform, patientslikeme.com, was founded by 3 engineers from this Boston-area university, initially\\"; the correct answer, provided by Helen Juvonen, was MIT. In 2016, co-founders Jamie and Ben Heywood were awarded the 2016 Humanitarian Award by the International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations. In 2017, PatientsLikeMe was named by Fast Company as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Biotech.

She earned an MBA degree in Marketing from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. Her corporate marketing career included stints at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago and Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, New Jersey. At Johnson & Johnson she launched the low-calorie sweetener ingredient sucralose, also known as Splenda Brand Sweetener, internationally from 1994-2000. She oversaw the public relations program for the sweetener's United States Food and Drug Administration approval on April 1, 1999. In early 2001 Steiner returned to her hometown of Washington, D.C., to become general manager of The Washington Post Magazine. While working for The Washington Post, Steiner became interested in the struggles of and tensions between American working and stay-at-home mothers. Her anthology Mommy Wars: Stay-at-Home and Career Moms Face off on their Choices, Their Lives, Their Families was published in 2006 by Random House and the essays by a range of at-home and working mothers such as Jane Smiley, Susan Cheever, Carolyn Hax and Jane Juska generated extensive media interest and controversy among conflicted American mothers, including mommy bloggers, daddy bloggers and publications such as The Atlantic Monthly, the Los Angeles Times and elsewhere. After the book's publication, Steiner continued to interpret the mommy wars, including the controversy created by the nomination of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as the Republican Party's vice presidential candidate and Michelle Obama's position as the first African-American first lady. From 2006 to 2008, Steiner wrote On Balance, an online column exploring work/family conflicts for washingtonpost.com, the Internet site for her employer. On Balance, one of the site's first forays into the blogosphere, quickly became popular among a diverse audience of men and women with and without children. Over the course of two years, Steiner's column became one of the most popular \\"mommy blogs\\" on the web. Steiner wrote over 500 columns, and the site accumulated over 100,000 comments from online posters. The readership weighed in with up to 700 comments per day. Over the course of 27 months, 112,898 total comments were submitted by 11,735 different posting names and 16,632 anonymous posters. Steiner's 2009 memoir Crazy Love, about surviving domestic violence spent three weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. Steiner is the author of a popular TED Talk which tries to explain why victims stay with abusive partners. Her third book, The Baby Chase: How Surrogacy Is Transforming the American Family, was published by St. Martin's Press in 2013, and is the subject of a 2014 TEDTalk about the ethics of global surrogacy. Steiner has three children and lives in the District of Columbia.

Origin  In the United States, Kiwanis clubs originated the idea of teaching bicycle safety to organized groups of children. They set up bicycle lectures which then became bicycle seminars. Eventually, a more hands on approach was used to teach the children and the term bicycle rodeo was adopted. This name is much more attractive to children and helped the events to grow in popularity. In Denmark a similar concept called mobil cykelbanes (mobile bicycle playgrounds) was introduced about 2012.Mobil cykelbanes. URL accessed April 5, 2018.  Organizers  Bicycle rodeos are usually run by local police departments. Police Chief Rosanne M. Sizer of the Portland, Oregon Police Department said, \\"It's important that our children understand bicycle safety. This is an opportunity for area youth to learn important skills and in the process get to know some of our bicycle, traffic, and reserve officers.\\"\\"Bike Rodeo Teaches Important Safety Skills\\". Portland Police Bureau. Retrieved on June 29, 2008 The Kiwanis clubs still run rodeos with the police departments. Others who run rodeos are schools, outdoor recreation companies, the Boy Scouts of America, State Farm Insurance, and large bicycle shops or sporting goods stores.  Activities  right Bicycle Rodeos are usually for the age group of 4‚Äì13 years old. The activities that are provided are suitable for each age so that no one is bored during the event. Each rodeo usually begins with a short lecture on bicycle safety and is then followed by a written exam to test the child's knowledge of bicycle use. Each rodeo has some type of a road course; this is usually the children's favorite part of the entire day. Some rodeos have more funding which allows them to build a small town for the children to ride around in as if it were real. This small town is called Safety Town. Throughout the town there are real life situations such as traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians crossing the streets, and road intersections. The children learn to handle riding their bikes in this life like setting. Rodeos are a popular place for businesses to come and set up booths to sell bike related products and give away gifts to the children. Many times local radio stations will broadcast their shows live from the rodeo and provide music to add to the experience. = Eight stations = In a typical bicycle rodeo there are eight different stations with chalk courses that the children have to master in order to pass the course. The objective of each course is to make sure that each child knows how to operate his or her bike correctly. The stations are: mounting and dismounting the bicycle, changing direction and turning in circles, steering through tight spaces, weaving, having the ability to stop quickly, turning around, riding the bicycle very slowly while maintaining balance, and learning to maneuver tight turns. = Safety = Every Bicycle rodeo has a safety course. Most rodeos begin the course with the safety check for both the rider and the bicycle because it is very important. The safety check for the rider is the helmet and bicycle fit. An ABC quick check is performed on the bicycle. The ABC quick check consists of checking for proper air in the tires, checking to see that the brakes work, and checking that the chains are on properly. = Other activities = Bicycle rodeo vary in what they offer. There are always plenty of fun things to do. After each child is finished with the safety course they are free to go around to the different booths to check out what they have. There is usually plenty of food and free prizes. A local bicycle shop might be giving away a bell or light for the bicycle. There might also be competitions held where the children can show off their newly learned skills. Some of the competitions may involve racing. Whatever activities a bicycle rodeo may offer, you can be sure it will be a safe and fun filled day.

Godin plays a variety of styles, including heavy metal, jazz fusion, blues and more.  Biography  Christophe Godin was born in Annecy, France. He has toured with some famous musicians, like Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal (Guns N' Roses), Andy Timmons (Danger Danger), Mattias Eklundh (Freak Kitchen), Kiko Loureiro (Angra, Megadeth), Guthrie Govan, etc. M√∂rglbl shared the stage with Liquid Tension Experiment (3/5 of Dream Theater plus Tony Levin on bass) at US biggest indoor prog festival, NEARfest in 2008 for the festival's 10th anniversary. He also played with Paul Gilbert (Mr. Big), Frank Gambale (Chick Corea), Jennifer Batten (Michael Jackson). Godin is known for his sense of humour, virtuosic guitar skills, energetic performances and overall wacky personality. (These traits can be best observed in one of his live performances, where he does both the vocals and guitar parts in the Jimi Hendrix classic \\"Little Wing\\". Instead of playing the chords as they would normally be played, Godin played the arpeggiated versions of those chords using the sweep picking technique, all the while singing in time with his playing.) He is a world class in demand clinician, and tours and teaches all over the globe. His style combines all aspects of modern guitar and steps into all genres, from metal to jazz. Though famous for his virtuosity and improvisational skills, he is an accomplished rhythm guitarist and a respected composer and arranger. Christophe Godin began his musical journey as a local guitar hero in several bands which, unfortunately, never left any trace. In 1995, with Temple, Christophe played on an album that was properly distributed in France and received a wave of positive reviews. In 1996, he took part on Guitare Attitudes, a compilation featuring French guitarists, that allowed him to regularly appear on the French TV show Nulle Part Ailleurs (Canal +) as a guest guitarist. In 1997, he created, along with Ivan Rougny and Jean-Pierre Frel√©zeau, the M√∂rglbl Trio !! and released two albums (\\"The M√∂rglbl Trio !!\\" in 1998 and \\"Bienvenue √† M√∂rglbl Land\\" in 1999). With this band, the doors to international distribution finally opened. In the meantime, Christophe, who's been a teacher at the E.T.M. of Geneva, Switzerland, since 1994, acquired a solid reputation as a guitar instructor with the release of an instructional video (Heavy metal : les techniques) and the multitude of articles he wrote for dozens of guitar magazines in France, Germany and the UK. He became a regular guest at the prestigious M.A.I. of Nancy in France, and runs master- classes everywhere on the planet. In 2001, he created Gn√¥, with Gabriel Vegh (bass/vocals) and Peter Puke (drums/vocals), and released \\"Trash Deluxe\\". Gn√¥ was on tour intensively throughout France until 2003. Finally, simultaneously with his duo with Pierrejean Gaucher (the 2G, playing Frank Zappa covers alongside their original material), Christophe, released his solo project named Christophe Godin's Metal Kartoon, where all the ingredients that made the career of the guitarist what it is are to be found on this record: humour, virtuosity, and a mix of jazz, funk and metal. Now simply named \\"Morglbl\\", the band released their sixth album Tea Time For P√ºnks on 26 May 2015. Christophe has toured intensively with the band all over the world including √® US Tours, one China Tour, and performances all over the world. Christophe also performs with guitarist extraordinaire Oliver-Roman Garcia in an impressive acoustic guitar duo extravaganza ! Godin was voted fifth best international guitarist by Guitar Part magazine. Christophe is an official international ambassador and tours worldwide for the following companies : Laney amps (UK), Vigier guitars (France), Cole Clark acoustic guitars (Australia), Zoom effects (Japan), Palmer effects (Germany), Gruv Gear (US).

The party opposed socialism but it founders could not reconcile with the political line of the main conservative party H√∏jre under the leadership of Jacob Estrup. The Free Conservatives worked for unity between Folketinget and Landstinget.Engelstoft, Povl/Wendt, Frantz Wilhelm. Haandbog i Danmarks politiske Historie fra Freden i Kiel til vore Dage. Gyldendal. 1934. Founding The founders of the Free Conservatives, originally eight Landsting members from H√∏jre, had tried to forge unity between the moderate sectors of H√∏jre and Venstre around a new tax reform. The plans of a new unified party failed, and 'the eight' came to function as a separate faction. The tax reform proposal, which 'the eight' and Venstre had agreed upon, was adopted by Folketinget in 1900. However, in Landstinget H√∏jre launched a counterproposal. As a result, 'the eight' broke away from H√∏jre and formed a separate party with nine Landsting members. Informally, the name of the new party was 'the Free Conservatives'. The name was formally adopted by the party in 1902. Relations with Venstre Between 1901 and 1912, the Free Conservatives had considerable influence over the policies of the Venstre governments. The party was able to bar universal suffrage to be introduced in the amt council elections. The party was also participant in the fall of Peter Adler Alberti in 1908. However, in 1912 Venstre presented a proposal for a democratic constitution for Denmark. This caused a split between Venstre and the Free Conservatives. After the new constitution was introduced in 1915, the Free Conservatives reunified with H√∏jre, forming the Conservative People's Party.

The use of the term 'Bernera Riot' correctly relates to the court case which exposed the maltreatment of the peasant classes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and exposed the corruption that was inherent in the landowning class. The 'riot' was not fought in the streets or in the fields but in the Scots Lawcourts. It is notable as the first successful legal challenge to nineteenth century Landlordism in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and was the catalyst for future resistance in what became known as the Crofters War. Modern land reform in Scotland has its roots in the outcome of this event. Location Great Bernera (Be√†rnaraigh M√≤r) is an island in Loch Roag, off the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. It is fairly close to Lewis, but it was not until 1953 that a bridge was built, after the islanders threatened to dynamite the hillside to create a causeway. Bernera was a crofting community at the time of the riot but today that form of land-holding is rapidly diminishing. Beginnings The whole of north west Scotland suffered from the Highland Clearance over a period of a hundred years or more. Although much lamented in Gaelic song, and literature, in very few places did they meet a stiff resistance - Bernera was one of the first places to challenge the authorities, and Skye was another, where the Battle of the Braes took place. Sir James Matheson having bought the Isle of Lewis, also took charge of adjoining Bernera, and appointed a solicitor, Donald Munro to be his factor. Munro was perceived as being heavy-handed, and his evictions were naturally unpopular. As there was no security of tenure for the peasants and the vast majority were illiterate Munro had authority to issue very harsh and sweeping edicts. The Bernera islanders had their summer grazings on mainland Lewis taken away from them in 1850 in favour of a new sporting estate known as the Uig deer forest. Furthermore, they were forced to construct dykes at their own expense as a new boundary between their stock and the sporting estate. In time this area was considered not large enough for the sporting estate and in 1872 Munro issued a notice that even this new smaller grazings area would be taken from the Bernera people and their ancient grazings rights would disappear altogether. The islanders naturally had enough and made a stance against this tyranny. The Riot When the Bernera people refused to bow to Munro's tyranny his response was to send the Sheriff Officer and the Ground Officer over to Bernera with eviction orders for 58 families. These eviction notices were initially greeted with quiet disbelief in Breaclete. When the bailiffs arrived at Tobson however, they were pelted with a shower of clods of earth. The sheriff officer also had his coat torn and he issued a threat that if he had a gun many Bernera mothers would be mourning the loss of their sons. The Response After three crofters were singled out and arrested hundreds of Bernera men marched on Lews Castle, Stornoway with pipers at their head. They demanded an audience with Sir James Matheson himself. Matheson who was somewhat aged at the time disowned Donald Munro, who came to be dismissed in 1875. The prisoners themselves were acquitted following the brilliant performance of the Inverness lawyer Charles Innes. Mr Innes's name is still revered in Bernera today. His most famous quotation from the trial was \\"Oppressed as they are I, as a stranger, cannot but admire them. Had Mr Munro, instead of being Chamberlain of The Lews, been an Agent in either Connaught or Munster, he would long ago have licked the dust he has for years made the poor men of this island swallow\\". The Bernera court case of 1874 is the first documented victory for Highland crofters and correctly holds its place as the opening shot of the crofters fight-back which led to the Napier Commission and land reform. Influence The riot was mentioned in a number of Scottish radical journals in the following years. The \\"Battle of the Braes\\" (Scottish Gaelic: Bl√†r a' Chumhaing) took place on Skye less than a decade later, in 1882, when crofters began a rent strike and confronted the Portree Sheriff's Officer sent to enforce eviction notices against them, forcing him to burn the documentation. This resulted in the deployment of around 50 police officers from Glasgow to the area, who were met by an angry mob of men, women and children armed with improvised weapons. The Crofters' War took place about ten years later, and led to the founding of the Napier Commission, which led to compromises being made on behalf of the crofters, and the reform of crofting in Scotland, beginning with the passing of the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886. The Gaelic poet, Iain Mac a' Ghobhainn (John Smith) lived in Lewis near Bernera at the time of the Riot, and wrote his poem Spiorad a' Charthannais (Spirit of Charity) in condemnation of feudal tyranny.

Housed on the former property of Pulitzer Prize-winning feminist/activist poet and playwright Edna St. Vincent Millay, the Colony's campus offers artists, students, and art lovers residencies, retreats, and classes. History thumb In 1925, Edna St. Vincent Millay bought Steepletop, a house with a blueberry farm in Austerlitz, NY, named after a pink, conical wildflower that grows there.The New York Times, May 16, 1986. With her husband, Millay built a barn from a Sears Roebuck kit, and then a writing cabin, and a tennis court. After the poet's death in 1950, her sister Norma Millay Ellis moved to Steepletop. In 1973, she founded The Millay Colony, which was established as a nonprofit organization.\\"Millay Farm Becoming an Arts Colony,\\" The New York Times, February 20, 1974. Norma Millay Ellis donated the barn and surrounding acreage to The Millay Colony. The barn was subsequently renovated to provide accommodations and studio space for four resident artists. In the mid-1990s, The Millay Colony commissioned architectural firm Michael Singer Studio, in consultation with an advisory committee of six artists with disabilities, to design an additional building for the Colony using the principles of universal access and environmentally friendly design.\\"An Artists' Retreat Is Extending Its Welcome,\\" New York Times, October 3, 1996. This 3,550 square foot building currently houses The Millay Colony's offices and public rooms, and provides accommodations and studio space for three additional artists, for a total capacity of seven. The Colony is adjacent to Steepletop, Edna St. Vincent Millay's former home and gardens, which today are maintained by the Millay Society (established as a nonprofit in 1972). The Millay Society also holds rights to the poet's intellectual property and operates as a separate organization from The Millay Colony. The house and gardens are a National Historic Landmark. Arts Education The Millay Colony offers Workshop Retreats, formulated and taught by artists with a commitment to teaching. These affordable, multi-day classes, held on The Millay Colony's campus, invite artists at all stages of their career to develop new work while engaging with other artists. Concurrently, the Colony offers a multiform program of arts education to more than 500 public school children in four local school districts each year, as well as professional development/teacher training on using the arts across disciplines for local teachers. Residencies The Millay Colony offers residencies to emerging and established visual artists, writers, and composers‚Äîindividually and in collaborating groups ‚Äì from April to November. These artists and groups receive private bedrooms and private studios as well as all meals and access to the Colony's libraries, darkroom, music room and the natural resources on the campus adjacent Harvey Mountain State Forest. October 1 is the date to apply for residencies in April to July of the following year. March 1 is the date to apply for residencies in August to November of the same year. All residencies are reviewed anonymously by juries of artists, critics and curators. The Colony hosts over 60 residents per year.

The delimitation of this family, part of the taxonomically confusing Grapsoidea, is undergoing revision. For a long time, they were placed at the rank of subfamily in the Grapsidae, but they appear to be closest to Macropthalmus and the Mictyridae, which are usually placed in the Ocypodoidea. It may thus be better to merge the latter superfamily with the Grapsoidea, retaining the latter name as it is older. That notwithstanding, the revision of the Grapsoidea (in the narrow but apparently still paraphyletic sense) is also not fully completed, as many taxa remain to be restudied. Already, several former Grapsidae genera have been moved to the Varunidae, and others are tentatively placed here pending detailed study. Among the most noteworthy of these is the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis. The genus Xenograpsus, formerly included in the Varunidae, is now placed in its own family, the Xenograpsidae.

It is poisonous, with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms, and is related to Rubroboletus satanas. Taxonomy Boletus legaliae was described by Czech mycologist Albert Pil√°t in 1968. It is named after the French mycologist Marcelle Le Gal. Boletus splendidus as described by Charles-√âdouard Mart√≠n in 1894 is a synonym. The description of Boletus satanoides was too vague to be ascribed to any actual species. Boletus legaliae was transferred to the genus Rubroboletus in 2015 by Marco Della Maggiora and Renzo Trassinelli. Description The cap is initially off-white, or coffee-coloured at the button stage. In mid life it often (but not always) turns a pale mouse grey. In old age the cap turns reddish, or what has been described as 'old rose'. It may reach in diameter. The stipe is stocky, with a narrow red reticulation (net pattern) on an orange ground at the apex. This orange ground colour fades gradually towards the midsection, making the red reticulation more pronounced. At the base the reticulation is absent, and the stipe turns dark vinaceous. Sometimes the stipe detail can be faint, or even absent when covered with earth or leaf litter. The pores are initially red, but have an overall orange colour when mature, and they bruise blue. The flesh turns pale blue on cutting / dark vinaceous in the stipe base. The flesh is said to smell of chicory. =Similar species= Rubroboletus satanas, found in broad-leaved woodland on calcareous soil, has a whiter cap that turns brownish-ochre, lacking the overall reddish tones in maturity. It has a more nauseating smell, and it is poisonous, possibly deadly. Molecular study of the holotype of Rubroboletus spinari has demonstrated its conspecifity with Rubroboletus legaliae. Distribution and habitat Uncommon in Southern England, and Europe. Grows with oak (Quercus) and beech (Fagus) often on neutral to acid soils. It is considered vulnerable in the Czech Republic. Toxicity Edibility testing resulted in a strong gastrointestinal upset, which is typically caused by Rubroboletus species when eaten raw. Group status In Britain, all of the boletes in the Satanas group are either very rare, endangered, or extinct.

He lived in Argentina and Mexico for some time, and was planning on becoming an engineer in a gold mine. In 1925, he immigrated to the United States. Education Gonzalez began his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1921 to 1923, and his uncle, Jos√© Arpa, studied with him there. He also studied at the San Carlos Academy in Mexico City, as well as in Paris and in the Far East.

The company was founded in 1962. At its peak in 2011, Education Management Corporation operated 110 schools through its higher education divisions: Argosy University, The Art Institutes, Brown Mackie College, and South University, and enrolled 158,300 students. Facing declining enrollment, legal issues, and accreditation problems, EDMC closed or sold many of its schools between 2013 and 2017. By 2014, the company's stock had lost 99.9% of its value, and EDMC received a defaulted bond rating (to junk bond status). Moody's credit rating service in January 2015 dropped EDMC to its lowest rating, D-PD. In June 2018, EMDC filed for Chapter7 bankruptcy and began to liquidate its assets.Education Management files Chapter 7 Funding and Expenses Eighty percent of Education Management's funds came from US government funds, from US Department of Education Title IV programs (Pell Grants and federal student loans), the US Department of Defense, and the Veterans Administration. In 2009, EDMC allocated 21.6 percent of its revenue, or $435 million, to marketing and recruiting, and 16 percent, or $319 million, to profit.http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/PartII/EDMC.pdf EDMC spent over $500,000 per year on lobbyists between 2010 and 2015. Programs EDMC operated through four major groups of schools, Argosy University, The Art Institutes, Brown Mackie College, South University. It also owned a law school, Western State University College of Law. Programs offered included doctoral, master's, bachelor's, associate and certificate level. As of January 2013, EDMC operated 110 colleges and universities in 32 U.S. states and Canada. =Colleges and universities= Argosy University became part of EDMC in July 2001, when Education Management Corporation acquired Argosy Education Group. Argosy schools were sold along with other EDMC schools to Dream Center in 2017. All Argosy campuses were officially closed on March 8, 2019. The Art Institutes, of which there were approximately 50 locations in the U.S. and Canada, offered programs in design, fashion, media and culinary arts. In 2017, Education Management Corporation sold the existing Art Institutes to The Dream Center Foundation, a Los Angeles-based Pentecostal organization. The sale was complete in October 2017. As of August 2019, eight locations remain open to new students, operated by the Education Principle Foundation, and no longer connected to EDMC or Dream Center. Brown Mackie College offers programs in health sciences, business, legal studies, information technology and design technology at the associate and bachelor's level. The school also offers diploma and certificate programs. In 2012, there were 28 Brown Mackie College locations in the U.S. In June 2016, it was announced that 22 of 26 Brown Mackie campuses were closing. The Akron campus was closed in September 2006. The last three campuses were sold to Ross Medical Education Center in 2017. South University is a for-profit university with its main campus in Savannah, Georgia. Additional locations are in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Education Management Corporation acquired South University in 2003. The schools were sold along with other EDMC schools to Dream Center in 2017. History =Foundation and early history= EDMC was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1962 and acquired its first educational institution in 1969 with the purchase of the nearly 50-year-old Art Institute of Pittsburgh. In October 1996 the EDMC conducted a $45 million initial public offering ($ in dollars). By 1998, EDMC served 17,400 students at 15 Art Institutes and three additional schools. =Expansion in the 2000s= In July 2001, EDMC purchased Chicago-based Argosy Education Group, the operator of Argosy University campuses, for $78 million ($ in dollars). The acquisition allowed EDMC to offer programs in law, education and business. In 2003 EDMC acquired the health sciences-focused South University in April and 18 schools operated by the Ohio-based American Education Centers in June, which were re-branded Brown Mackie College a year later. In September 2003, former Maine governor John McKernan became EDMC chief executive officer, serving until 2007. He oversaw continued acquisitions of existing art and design schools in the U.S. and Canada, construction of new Art Institute locations and the establishment of on-line education programs. Goldman Sachs, Providence Equity Partners and Leeds Equity Partners acquired EDMC and its 70 schools for $3.4 billion in March 2006 ($ in dollars). On June 1, 2006, EDMC was taken private again in the largest for-profit education sector buyout at that time. At the time of the acquisition EDMC's schools were serving around 72,000 students, 4,000 of whom were enrolled in online programs. The additional capital was used grow online enrollment to more than 40,000 students by the end of the decade, made possible in part by a 2006 Congressional revision to the \\"50% rule\\", which formerly required accredited schools to enroll more than half their students in campus-based programs in order to maintain federal loan eligibility. Todd S. Nelson, who was previously the CEO of Apollo Education Group, became the CEO in 2007 and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2012. On September 21, 2009,\\"Education Management Corporation Commences Initial Public Offering of Common Stock .\\" Corporate Press Release, September 21, 2009. EDMC became a public company once again, raising $330 million ($ in dollars) on the NASDAQ while Goldman Sachs retained 40% ownership. =Recent history= In 2011, EDMC and its then-subsidiary, the Art Institutes, received greater public scrutiny with the release of the Frontline documentary: Educating Sergeant Pantzke. In the documentary, Iraq war veteran Chris Pantzke discussed the lack of disability services at the school. According to Pantzke, \\"Being a soldier, you don't want to quit, you don't want to give up or fail.\\" But after doing his own research, Pantzke concluded that the degree he was pursuing wasn't \\"worth much more than the paper is worth\\". And he felt he was \\"throwing away taxpayer money\\" by using GI Bill funds. In 2012, Edward West replaced Todd Nelson as CEO, while Nelson replaced McKernan as chairman. After the growth in student numbers in the late 2000s, EDMC's enrollment declined from around 160,000 students in 2011 to approximately 130,000 students at the end of 2012. EDMC has attributed this to the economic downturn of the late 2000s and new federal restrictions on the PLUS Loan program. The decrease in enrollment, coupled with pending changes to the U.S. Department of Education's \\"gainful employment\\" rule, prompted EDMC to hold off expansion plans in 2012, and led to several rounds of layoffs. Only one new school opening has been announced in the 2013 fiscal year. In February 2013, EDMC announced a tuition freeze through at least 2015, as part of a strategy to refocus on students. As of 2014 enrollment was 120,920 students, a decrease of nine percent. From June 2013 to June 2014, the company eliminated about 2,600 positions, and campuses have been closed or are in the process of closing. On May 6, 2015 EDMC announced it would begin closing 15 of its Art Institute locations, citing declining enrollment and restructuring. The week of June 13, 2016 the corporation announced the planned closure of most of its Brown Mackie College campuses, with 22 of the 26 slated for closure. In December 2016, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) announced that nine Art Institute campuses and all 15 South University campuses were placed on probation. EDMC has faced significant financial problems, including a 99.9% drop in the value of its stock and a defaulted bond rating (to junk bond status). Under a pending agreement, shareholder stock value will be diluted an additional 96%. Moody's credit rating service in January 2015 dropped EDMC to its lowest rating, D-PD. EDMC's CEO, Edward West, resigned from the company on August 28, 2015, \\"to pursue other interests\\". The company was never profitable under his leadership. EDMC was delisted from the NASDAQ in November 2014. EDMC has been the subject of several lawsuits and investigations alleging that the company made misleading claims in its efforts to recruit students. On November 16, 2015, federal and state authorities announced a $95.5-million settlement resolving a whistleblower case in which former EDMC employees said the company was \\"illegally paying recruiters based on the number of students they enrolled\\". As of 2016, EDMC announced that it was planning to close 19 of its Art Institute campuses and 22 of 26 Brown Mackie College campuses. In 2017, EDMC sold its remaining Brown-Mackie campuses to Ross Medical Education Centers. In 2017, EDMC reported that it had sold the existing Art Institutes to The Dream Center Foundation, a Los Angeles-based Pentecostal organization. The sale was complete in October 2017. In 2017, EDMC reported 109 locations, but more than 40 Brown Mackie Colleges and Art Institutes schools were in the process of closing at that time. On October 18, 2017 EDMC announced it completed the sale of 31 Art Institute Schools, South University, and Argosy University to the Dream Center Foundation. As of 30 June 2018, it was announced that EMDC filed for Chapter7 bankruptcy and began to liquidate its assets. Corporate affairs EDMC's headquarters is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company's chairman, Mark A. McEachen, replaced Todd Nelson who was its chairman since July 2012. Until recently, its chief executive was Edward West, who resigned August 28, 2015; the company currently lists no CEO. The current board of directors has five members, all of whom have been with the company less than one year. Their Chairman, Mark McEachen, was nominated by preferred stockholders after the 2015 company-debt restructuring. Political activities Starting in the late 2000s, EDMC has engaged in lobbying and political advocacy. One such area was the Department of Education's June 2011 \\"gainful employment rule\\" which limits access to federal student loan money for students attending private-sector institutions with high post-graduation unemployment and default rates. EDMC opposed the rule's original draft, arguing that it limited minority and low-income students access to higher education. EDMC established a PAC in 2009 to address politically important industry issues. During the 2010 elections its PAC donated more than $50,000 to organizations of both parties and to politicians including Democratic Congressman Jason Altmire, who opposed the \\"gainful employment rule\\", as well as to Republican Congressman John Kline, Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and the DCCC. An additional $850,000 was spent on 2010 lobbying efforts. With other private-sector colleges and universities, EDMC helped form the Coalition for Educational Success in 2010. Represented by Lanny Davis, the CES lobbied for changes to the \\"gainful employment rule\\". The coalition persuaded the Department of Education to amend the rule, making vocational programs and programs with the highest debt and lowest loan repayment rates ineligible for federal loans. Private-sector providers were also given time to comply with the changes. EDMC Senior VP of Regulatory Affairs and Strategic Development, Anthony J. Guida Jr., served, by appointment, on the U.S. Department of Education's Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance from 2009 until September 2012. He previously served on the Board of the Association of Private Colleges and Universities, an advocacy organization, and currently serves on the organization's Federal Legislative Affairs Committee. According to Open Secrets, EDMC's expenses for lobbyists were: *2009: $110,000 *2010: $815,000 *2011: $750,000 *2012: $520,000 *2013: $520,000 *2014: $520,000 *2015: $520,000 EDMC's current lobbying group is Barnes & Thornburg Legal issues =Lawsuits regarding financial aid and recruitment practices= In 2007, two former EDMC recruiters filed a whistleblower complaint regarding recruitment and compensation practices at EDMC institutions. As a result of these complaints, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a federal lawsuit in 2011 on behalf of eleven states and the District of Columbia. The civil lawsuit was filed under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to file lawsuits when they believe the federal government has been defrauded. The lawsuit seeks to recoup $11 billion, the amount of federal money EDMC institutions received in the form of federal student aid between 2003 and 2011. The Department of Justice argued that EDMC violated federal rules banning incentive-based compensation and therefore acquired the federal funds illegally. In response to the charges, EDMC stated that the compensation plan in question was in compliance with then-current federal rules and had been reviewed and approved by two education law firms. In May 2012, the charges that the compensation plan was illegal were dismissed with other charges allowed to stand. During this time EDMC settled with a former South University recruiter alleging similar practices. The details were not public. A separate whistleblower lawsuit, filed by a former South University recruiter, was initiated in January 2010 and officially filed in March 2012. This lawsuit alleged that the company deliberately misclassified data to inflate the job- placement rates of its graduates and make the school more attractive to prospective students. Unlike the federal whistleblower lawsuit initiated in 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice has not joined the lawsuit. In October 2012, a U.S. magistrate judge dismissed allegations that the company failed to notify the U.S. government when students left their program and that the company misled prospective students about program costs. The remaining allegations were recommended for further review. In May 2013 U.S. Judge McVerry rejected EDMC's appeal to dismiss the case, and on May 11, 2014, he ordered full-blown pretrial discovery regarding the claims and defenses. As of March 2013, both the federal whistleblower case begun in 2007 and the case initiated in 2010 are pending. EDMC has responded to the claims saying that both cases \\"are wholly without merit\\". In December 2013, EDMC settled a civil claims suit filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office for $3.3 million. The suit was brought following investigation by the attorney general's office, and alleged that the company's Argosy University in Denver violated the Colorado Consumer Protection Act by engaging in deceptive marketing, in particular misleading students about prospects for employment following graduation. Students had lodged complaints that the school had led them to believe it was pursuing accreditation from the American Psychological Association for its education in counseling psychology program, although it was not. Without the accreditation, students were not accepted to local internships that met the state's licensing standards. As part of the settlement, EDMC agreed to reimburse tuition fees for 66 students, end advertisement of its education in counseling psychology program in Denver as a psychology licensure-track program, and not enroll any further students to the program. As of January, 2015, the Ed.D in Counseling Psychology was accepted for psychology licensure, and two graduates were advanced to Psychology Licensure candidacy, by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies and the Colorado Psychology Board. In November 2015, the US Justice Department announced that EDMC will pay nearly $95.5 million to settle claims the company used illegal incentives causing recruiters to use high-pressure tactics to convince students to enroll in the school. As part of the deal, the company will also forgive $102.9 million in loans students borrowed from the company to attend the school. The settlement resolves claims alleged in four whistleblower lawsuits, one of which the government intervened in. In addition, the deal covers allegations made as part of a consumer fraud investigation by the attorneys general of 39 states and the District of Columbia over claims the company misled students about job placement rates and other postgraduation outcomes while recruiting them. The loan forgiveness will affect 80,000 students and provide an average of $1,370 to each student. =Investigations= Four states initiated investigations in recent years with Florida in October 2010, New York, California and a subpoena of documents regarding Brown Mackie College from the Office of Consumer Protection of the Kentucky Attorney General in December 2010. In August 2010, EDMC and other private sector schools were investigated by the U.S. GAO, which reported that Argosy University (Chicago) recruiters misled undercover students about tuition and program quality. The GAO later revised parts of its original report from the investigation, which was the focus of testimony at a U.S. Senate HELP committee September 2010 hearing. A 2011 US DOJ report claimed that EDMC \\"created a 'boiler room' style sales culture and has made recruiting and enrolling new students the sole focus of its compensation system\\". In January 2014, EDMC was among several for-profit schools approached by approximately a dozen attorneys general for information in an investigation of their practices. EDMC's stock price has dropped more than 75% in the three months up to February 2014 as the company faced lower enrollments and investigations at state and federal levels, including investigations by states Attorneys General and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information that EDMC provided to the Senate Harkin Commission indicates that of the 78,661 students who enrolled at EDMC-owned colleges in 2008-9, 62.1 percent, or 48,840 students, dropped out as of mid-2010. As of 2013, about 120,000 students attended Education Management Corporation-operated schools, a drop from its peak of 160,000. In July 2016, a Maine Sunday Telegram expose found that former EDMC CEO Jock McKernan used a non-profit charity, the EDMC Foundation, to skirt federal 90/10 regulations. The expose was based on three- month investigation. =Dismissal of shareholder lawsuit= In 2010, several EDMC shareholders initiated a lawsuit alleging that EDMC had misled investors prior to the company's 2009 IPO, causing investors to lose money when the company's stock fell in 2010. The lawsuit was later joined by EDMC shareholders OPPRS and SEPTA. The case was dismissed by a federal judge in September 2011, as the shareholders were unable to show that the company had lied to investors. =Labor issues= In April 2016, two former teachers at the Art Institute of California sued EDMC for not giving them a minimum wage and for not offering adequate rest periods in order to 'reduce compensation and increase its own profits.' =Financial issues= In February 2014, Standard & Poor's cut EDMC's credit rating to CCC+ because of declining enrollment. Moody's credit rating service in January 2015 dropped EDMC to its lowest rating, D-PD, which it defines as \\"Corporate families ratedD are in default on all of their long-term debt obligations.\\" In 2014, EDMC's major creditor, KKR took control over EDMC's assets. As of July 30, 2016, EDMC is sold as an over the counter stock at approximately one cent per share. =Consumer fraud lawsuits= In 2016, former nursing students at Brown Mackie College in Tucson, Arizona sued the school, alleging that the poor training they received left them unable to be gainfully employed. The plaintiffs expected to graduate in 2015 until a state nursing board investigation found some of the school's faculty were unqualified and were using veterinary supplies to teach students how to care for human patients. The Arizona nursing board barred the Brown Mackie students from taking the practical nurses licensing exam and ordered the school to retrain the students at the company's expense. =Employee-ADR lawsuits= By the end of 2016, EDMC's legal perils had ensnared even the company's outside legal counsel at the Pittsburgh-based global law firm Reed Smith LLP. Advised by Attorney Katherine Ryan before two federal judges in discrimination lawsuits dating to August 2012, the company was defeated when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a sweeping October 18 order invalidating an alternative dispute resolution policy superimposed retroactively on the company's employees; EDMC had tried to bar aggrieved employees from filing suit in any court for any purpose. The 3-0 panel found that the policy had been illegally superimposed without employees' assent and thereby reinstated a pair of federal cases against the Art Institute of Pittsburgh demanding more than $4 million in damages and alleging legal malpractice inside EDMC.

Her original name was Gulkhan Khatun; Eudokia was her Christian baptismal name. Family Gulkhan was a daughter of David IX of Georgia and his wife Sindukhtar Jaqeli. She was also a sister of Bagrat V of Georgia.Listing of Bagrationi, page 3 Her paternal grandfather was George V of Georgia. The identity of his wife is not known. \\"The Georgian Chronicles\\" of the 18th century reports him marrying a daughter of \\"the Greek Emperor, Lord Michael Komnenos\\". However the reigning dynasty of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century were the Palaiologoi, not the Komnenoi. The marriage of a daughter of Michael IX Palaiologos and his wife Rita of Armenia to a Georgian ruler is not recorded in Byzantine sources. Neither is the existence of any illegitimate daughters of Michael IX. The Komnenoi did rule however in the Empire of Trebizond. A Michael Komnenos was Emperor from 1344 to 1349. His wife was Acropolitissa. Their only child recorded in primary sources was John III of Trebizond. Whether John III had siblings is unknown. Her maternal grandfather was Qvarqvare II Jaqeli, Prince of Samtskhe. The Jaqeli held the Georgian feudal office of Eristavi, a title that could be \\"governor of a region\\" or an \\"army-commander\\",Mariam Lordkipanidze , \\"Georgia in the XI-XII centuries\\", Glossary roughly equivalent to the Byzantine strategos and normally translated into English as \\"duke\\". Marriage Gulkhan was first betrothed or married to Andronikos of Trebizond, an illegitimate son of Alexios III of Trebizond. On 14 March 1376, Andronikos fell from a window in the imperial palace and subsequently died from his injuries. According to Michael Panaretos, only his mother and the Empress mother took part in the funeral procession, and the betrothal was transferred to Manuel III of Trebizond, whom Panaretos describes as the \\"younger, proper and legitimate\\" son of the Emperor. Details like these have led historians to suspect more to the incident.Panaretos, Chronicle, 48.

The revised betrothal was negotiated while she was still residing in Iberia: she left her father's kingdom and met the imperial party at Macragialos on 15 August 1377; together they returned to Trebizond on Sunday, 30 August. On 5 September Gulkhan was crowned Empress, taking the royal name of Eudokia, and she was married to Manuel the next day by the Metropolitan of Trebizond, Theodosius; the nuptial festivities lasted a week. Their only known son would reign as Alexios IV of Trebizond. Empress On 20 March 1390, Alexios III died. Manuel III succeeded him with Gulkhan as his Empress consort. Her term as Empress was brief, ending with her death on 2 May 1395.Panaretos, Chronicle, 54.

Career Cappuccino was born in Philadelphia and grew up in the neighborhood known as Kensington. Both he and his brother Vito (Vic) were accomplished boxers. Fighting as a lightweight (130 lb. class), Cappuccino fought more than 130 amateur bouts in the early 1950s. He participated in the Pennsylvania state championships and was a finalist in both the Diamond Belt and Golden Glove Tournaments. Leaving the amateur ranks in 1955, Cappuccino turned professional under the management of George Katz. Though undefeated in six professional matches, Cappuccino retired early. Asked why he didn't continue with his professional career, Cappuccino told Northeast Times reporter Joe fcaMason, \\"I decided that I had to either get out or get knocked on my heels. But I loved the sport and I wanted to stay involved.\\" Cappuccino received his referee's license in 1958. Over the past half-century, he has been the third man in the ring for over 25,000 bouts, including an estimated 10,000 professional matches. He has officiated 94 world championship bouts in North America, Europe and Asia. Boxing experts tended to praise Cappuccino's work in the squared circle. He typically allowed a boxer in trouble to try to fight his way out of it, rather than calling an abrupt (and unpopular) technical knockout. This was best evidenced in the memorable 2002 Mickey Ward vs. Arturo Gatti fight. Despite this, there never was an incident of serious injury in a match Cappuccino presided over. Asked about having Cappuccino as a referee, boxer Mickey Ward replied, \\"Frank was great and still is. He's an old guy but he does his homework and lets you fight your fight. I'd love to get Frank again. He does everything with his voice. I have a lot of respect for him.\\" Cappuccino was enshrined in both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame. Cappuccino also served as a boxing judge for several fights. The most notable bout he judged was Michael Spinks versus Dwight Muhammad Qawi for the undisputed World Light Heavyweight Championship, fought on March 18, 1983. Spinks won by unanimous decision. Outside the ring, Cappuccino was a supervisor for the Keebler Company. He also served as a sanitation control inspector for the School District of Philadelphia. He resided in Yardley, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife, Florence. Memorable fights *Mickey Ward, decisioned (10 rounds), and Arturo Gatti, May 19, 2002, Uncasville, Connecticut. It is considered by many boxing purists as \\"The Fight of the Century.\\" Cappuccino played a prominent role by masterful refereeing this tight and savage battle. In the fourth round, Gatti blasts a low punch into Ward's groin sending him down in pain. Cappuccino calls it a slip and takes a point from Gatti for the low blow. In the ninth round, Ward and Gatti landed an incredible 110 total punches‚Äî102 of them power shots. Late in the round, Gatti was enduring a severe beating from Ward; but the seasoned Cappuccino still saw some fight left in Arturo. It was a seminal moment; knowing the monumental nature of this fight, Cappuccino will not end this brawl on some technicality. Indeed, Gatti responded and fought back as the bell sounded. After the round, ring announcer Jim Lampley told a national audience, \\"The fight is being stopped!\\" Ward raised his arms in victory and both fighters approached the center of the ring. Cappuccino tells the world, \\"The fight ain‚Äôt over!\\" The fight resumed for the tenth and final round as people rushed back into their seats. The fight was ruled a majority decision for Ward. Had Cappuccino not penalized Gatti for the punch below the belt, the fight would have ended in a draw. However, the deduction was just as he warned Gatti about punching low several times before. Memorably, as the exhausted boxers entered a clinch in the final round, Cappuccino cautioned both fighters to 'Wind it up like pros, huh?' *Lennox Lewis, TKO (5th round), and Shannon Briggs, for Lewis‚Äô WBC Heavyweight Title, March 28, 1998, Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the fifth round, Briggs was beaten repeatedly by Lewis and was knocked down. Briggs got up on his feet and convinced Cappuccino to let him continue. After tasking more punishment from Lennox Lewis, Shannon Briggs launched a wild left hook that misses Lewis. The momentum of the errant punch fells the weakened Briggs to the canvas. Cappuccino had seen enough and justly ended the fight. *Bernard \\"The Executioner\\" Hopkins, TKO (11th round), and Carl Daniels, for Hopkins‚Äô Undisputed WBC, WBA, and IBF Middleweight Title, February 2, 2002. The fight marked Hopkins‚Äô 15th consecutive successful title defense - breaking the 25-year-old middleweight championship defense record held by Carlos Monz√≥n. Cappuccino stopped the bout on the advice of Daniels' corner. *Mike Tyson, KO (1st round), Michael Spinks, for Tyson's undisputed WBC, WBA, and IBF heavyweight titles, June 27, 1988, Atlantic City, New Jersey. In a battle of undefeated fighters, Tyson knocked Spinks out in 91 seconds. Cappuccino is prominently featured in Sports Illustrated magazine. Cappuccino considered it the greatest moment of his referee career. He commented, \\"I remember thinking here I am, a guy from Kensington, and I‚Äôm in the ring, looking out in the crowd, and I see people like Charlie Sheen and Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen. It was really something special. And people like Oprah Winfrey and Frank Sinatra missed the fight because it only lasted ninety-one seconds.\\" Cappuccino and the oft-maligned Tyson have a unique relationship. Frank refereed six of his bouts. When asked about Tyson, Cappuccino replied, \\"I can't say a bad thing about Mike Tyson.

It is, as its name suggests, located along Main Street between North Hempstead Turnpike (NY 25A) and East Broadway, incorporating Tower Street and portions of Glen Avenue and Paper Mill Road. It is mostly residential, with some commercial development at its northern end. The 50 buildings within it are mostly houses, many built during the 19th century before the Civil War, in the Federal and Greek Revival styles. Main Street has changed very little despite the heavy growth of surrounding areas of Nassau County. The district was created in the early 1970s and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Geography The Main Street area is bounded on the east by the waters of Roslyn Pond and on the west by steep upward slopes. There are no through cross streets, save Old Northern Boulevard, intersecting Main between North Hempstead and East Broadway. This geographic separation has been credited with helping the district retain its historic character. In the early 20th century, a small park was created out of some of the Roslyn Pond land as part of a malaria control project. It contains a replica of Roslyn's original paper mill, and is included within the district. History What has since become Roslyn was first settled in the mid-17th century as Hempstead Harbor, a port community serving Hempstead and other communities to the south. The Main Street area was where this settlement took place. The oldest property in the district, a section of the Van Nostrand-Starkins House, dates to 1680, during this period. In 1700 the village's first gristmill was built. Hendrick Onderdonk took it over in the 1750s, and was able to open up a paper mill in 1773, the first real industry in the village. Around that time the first extant house along Main Street, now numbered 150 Main Street, was built as well, by Wilson Williams, a cooper who worked for Onderdonk. George Washington stayed there in 1790, and his diary mentions the two mills. Roslyn Landmark Society office The clock tower The 19th century saw the houses along Main Street quadruple in number. Most of them were built by local builders or merchants, with only one, John Hendrickson's home at 110 Main, intended as an estate of the kind found elsewhere along Long Island's North Shore. The stone clock tower which serves as Roslyn's most identifiable landmark was erected at the junction of Main and Old Northern in 1895. Land use remained in the primarily residential pattern throughout the 20th century. In the late 1960s the Roslyn Landmark Society worked to protect and preserve the extant structures, culminating in the Register listing. The Roslyn Village Historic District, added 15 years later in 1987, also included the Main Street district as a component area. Significant Contributing Properties Several of the district's properties are notable within it: * Ellen J. Ward Memorial Clock Tower: Built in 1895 of random ashlar granite and limestone trim and located at the intersection of Main and Old Northern, it has become one of Roslyn's most visible local landmarks. The tower was designed by the New York firm of Lamb & Rich, and the clock mechanism itself by the Seth Thomas Clock Company. * William G. Valentine Store. One of the rare brick buildings from 19th-century Roslyn. Valentine reportedly acquired the brick at low cost during the economic downtimes that preceded the Civil War, and from them built his store as well as the neighboring buildings at 19, 21 and 23 Main Street. * Obadiah W. Valentine House, 105 Main Street. A clapboard Greek Revival structure built between 1833‚Äì36, its one-and-a-half-story height appears a story higher due to its construction into the steep slope on the west side of the street at this point. Several other nearby houses emulated the design. * Warren Wilkey House, 190 Main Street. Built for a successful New York businessman around 1865, this wood frame house is unusually large and ornate by Main Street standards. It actually is two and a half stories high, with a mansard roof and elaborated belvedere. In 1925 it was converted into three apartments. * Van Nostrand- Starkins House, 221 Main Street. A one-and-a-half-story clapboard structure begun in 1680, making it the oldest in the village, it was purchased by blacksmith Joseph Starkins in 1795. A later frame wing has been moved back, and the house has been restored to its 1810 appearance by the Roslyn Landmark Society. It is currently used as a museum. Preservation Roslyn has added to its ordinances a provision protecting the buildings in both its historic districts. They are recognized in its zoning and any additions, demolition or alterations are subject to approval by the six-member Historic District Board. The Roslyn Landmark Society also holds a restrictive covenant on some of the properties.

History The creek was named in the 1870s after early prospector and settler Oliver Furry. Loggers worked the slopes, and a two adits from the Britannia Creek mine opened into Furry Creek where logging camp supplied timbers for mine shoring in the early 1900s. Dams on Phyllis and Marion Lake and Furry Creek redirected water from Furry Creek to the Britannia mine for power generation. Later in the century a gravel pit operated in the area. Cabins and borstal at nearby Porteau Cove made the area sparsely populated for many years, with some camping and little other activity except for the highway and railroad that cut through the bottom of the watershed. Furry Creek Golf & Country Club Ribbon development along the Sea-to-Sky British Columbia Highway 99 is now infilling open areas like Furry Creek and Britannia Beach. The Furry Creek area saw significant changes with the addition of a golf course and luxury homes, starting in 1991 and opening in 1993, which was developed by a Japanese company, Tanac Land Development. Because its slopes are very steep and spread out nature of the links style course, golf carts are mandatory. Numerous films and commercials have been filmed there, including parts of Happy Gilmore. Furry Creek Hydro There is a run-of-river hydro plant located one kilometer up Furry Creek. Built in 2004, a weir in the creek diverts water to a 3km penstock dropping 366 meters to a powerhouse with a pelton wheel capable of generating 11 MW of electricity. In 2010 the plant was sold to Veresen Inc. an Independent power producer, who is contracted to sell power to BC Hydro.

He was well known for his invention of numerous analog circuit concepts, holding over 100 patents worldwide, and for the discovery of the Translinear Principle. His name is attributed to a class of related topologies loosely referred to as the Gilbert cell, one of which is a mixer - a key frequency translation device - used in every modern wireless communication device. A similar topology, for use as a synchronous demodulator, was invented by Howard Jones in 1963.Jones, Howard E., \\"Dual output synchronous detector utilizing transistorized differential amplifiers\\", U.S. patent 3,241,078A (filed: 18 June 1963 ; issued: 15 March 1966) Gilbert was born in Bournemouth, England. During the 1950s he pursued an interest in solid-state devices while at Mullard, working on the development of early transistors, and later, the first-generation planar ICs. After some pioneering development of sampling oscillography he emigrated to the United States in 1964 to pursue this interest at Tektronix, Beaverton, Oregon, where he developed the first electronic knob-readout system and other advances in instrumentation. He returned to England in 1970, where he was Group Leader at Plessey Research Laboratories, managing a team developing OCR systems and integrated circuits (ICs) for communications applications. From 1972-1977 he consulted for Analog Devices Inc., Beaverton, OR, designing several ICs embodying novel nonlinear concepts. He returned to the USA and Tektronix in 1977 to pursue HF ICs and process development. In 1979, Analog Devices allowed Gilbert to create the first remote design center for the Company, in Oregon, to persuade him to rejoin the company as their first Fellow. This center developed into the Northwest Labs. On February 4, 2020, Analog Devices announced that Barrie Gilbert had died. Awards and honors In 1984, Barrie Gilbert became a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). For pioneering work on merged logic, he received the IEEE \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" (1970) and later the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Council \\"Outstanding Development Award\\" (1986). He was Oregon Researcher of the Year in 1990 and he received the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Award (1992) \\"For contributions to non- linear analog signal processing circuits\\". He has five times received the ISSCC Outstanding Paper Award. He held an Honorary Doctorate from Oregon State University. In 2009, Gilbert was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering.

There are at least 13 species in the genus Aurelia including many that are still not formally described. It has been suggested that Aurelia is the best-studied group of gelatinous zooplankton, with Aurelia aurita the best-studied species in the genus; two other species, Aurelia labiata and Aurelia limbata have also been investigated (studies summarized by Arai). Since most previous studies of Aurelia were done without the benefit of genetic identification, one cannot positively attribute the results of most research to the species named. Species of Aurelia can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and are common to the waters off California, northern China, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the Black Sea, Indonesia, the eastern coast of the United States as well as Europe. Aurelia undergoes alternation of generations, whereby the sexually- reproducing pelagic medusa stage is either male or female, and the benthic polyp stage reproduces asexually. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from juvenile and sexually mature medusae or their fragments, was also observed in Aurelia sp.1. The genus was first described in 1845 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his book Histoire Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertebres (Natural History of Invertebrates). A. aurita 1a Environment Aurelia have a wide range of marine environments and have been found along coastal regions between 70 degrees north to 55 degrees south (6). They are often considered to be the most widely distributed genus of jellyfish. (12) The species A. aurita tends to live in all oceanic areas other than the northern arctic where-as its counterpart, A. labiata inhabits the northern polar regions of the ocean (12). The ability for Aurelia to adapt to a large range of temperatures and salinities may show a flexibility in their ecology and life history (5) that allowed them to adapt to these variations throughout their evolution (3). However, many live along the coast in temperate climates (10) and around coastal environments where it is safer for the polyps to develop (1). As the temperature of the water increases, whether with global warming or seasonal, the number of medusae increases as well as the ratio of polyps to medusae (8). Without the influence of wind and water currents, Aurelia live alone, however, they are thought to be brought together into aggregations as a result of wind and water currents (10). With all of the variability from their environments, the medusae of Aurelia are able to ‚Äúde- grow‚Äù which allows them to cheat death in a way until proper conditions are met in order to survive by becoming a smaller medusa (5). Speciation There is a debate around exactly how many species of Aurelia there are. There have been many studies done to accurately determine the just how many species and subspecies of Aurelia there are. Some have used DNA evidence from both mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNA in order to accurately depict this number. According to one study there are 16 different species of moon jellyfish (6) and another suggests there are only 12 (7) and yet another suggests that Aurelia is a polyphyletic clade, a group of organisms that are grouped together but do not share a common ancestor, and that there are 13 species (4). However, collectively it is agreed that there are two specifically recognized species of Aurelia: A. aurita and A. labiate, along with some subspecies. (7) Appearance The differing appearances of moon jellyfish is what has made them so hard to identify. They tend to have a variety of different sizes (9), however, they typically range from 5-38 centimetres in diameter with an average of 18 cm wide and 8 cm in height (10). The polyps of these jellyfish can grow to 1.6 centimeters tall and their ephyrae, the larval form of the jellyfish, have an average diameter of 0.4 centimetres (1). The adult medusae are typically translucent in color (1) but the color of their gut can change based on what they eat; for example, if they eat crustaceans, they can have a pink or lavender tint to them and if they were to eat brine shrimp, the tint would be more of an orange color (2). A. aurita typically have shorter tentacles in the middle of the bell shape, other than the longer ones that are on the circumference of the bell, with cilia ‚Äì small hair-like structures ‚Äì on them in order to sweep prey towards the edge of the bell where there is a mucous layer and oral arms (2). A. labiata have just the opposite, where the oral arms are longer than their bell tentacles (2). Their polyps can have up to twenty-two tentacles to help with feeding and other necessary activities (1). Feeding The diet of Aurelia is similar to that of other jellyfish. They primarily feed on zooplankton (10). They store their prey in special pouches until they are ready to eat it and use their four oral arms (1) to bring it to the mouth (2). However, their feeding can cause economic issues. They commonly either prey on or compete with the commercial fisheries and their larvae as well as cause several issues for trawling boats (6) such as loss of revenue due to lost fishing time and bycatch, damage done to gears in the boats and the equipment, and having to relocate due to large aggregations (13). Characteristics They are able to sense light and dark and sense up and down (10) using statocysts around the bell. After many tests on frogs, it was determined that A. aurita has a proteinaceous venom that causes muscle twitching by inducing the irreversible depolarization of the muscle membrane that is believed to be caused by an increase in the membrane‚Äôs permeability to sodium ions (11). Reproduction The reproduction of Aurelia has been studied extensively by scientists. The medusa stage of the jellyfish reproduce sexually. The males release strings of sperm and the females ingest them (2). Once the ciliated larvae develop from the egg, they settle on or near the sea floor and develop into benthic polyps. The polyps can alternate between reproductive phases and feeding phases for up to twenty-five years (2). The polyps then reproduce asexually and bud into ephyrae which later turn into medusa. However, Aurelia typically reproduce when there are too many nutrients in the surrounding waters (2).

Life Le Nourry was born at Dieppe in Normandy. He received his first education from the priests of the Oratory at his Dieppe; then entered the Benedictine Order at Jumi√®ges, 8 July 1665. After completing his theological studies and being ordained to the priesthood, he was sent to Rouen, and the Abbey of Bonnenouvelle. He died at the Abbey of St-Germain in Paris. Works He assisted Jean Garet in publishing the writings of Cassiodorus (1679). For this he wrote the preface and the life of the author. In the edition of the works of St. Ambrose he aided Jean du Chesne and Julien Bellaise at Rouen, and later Jacques du Frische at Paris, where he spent the last forty years of his life. His major work is the \\"Apparatus ad bibliothecam maximam veterum patrum et antiquorum scriptorum\\", published at Paris in two volumes (1703 and 1715) as an aid to the study of the Lyon collection of the Church Fathers. In extensive dissertations he gives the biography of each writer; the occasion, design, scope, and genuineness of every writing; a history of the time in which the author lived; its dogmatical and moral tendency, and its struggles against heathenism or heresies. The work was well received. In 1710 he edited the \\"Liber ad Donatum confessorem de mortibus persecutorum\\", and in a special dissertation tries hard to prove that the book was written by Lucius Caecilius and not by Lactantius.

Synopsis In 1994, Moss was an 18-year-old college student at UNLV. While studying for his honors thesis, he established relationships by correspondence with John Wayne Gacy, Richard Ramirez, Henry Lee Lucas, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Charles Manson. He obtained samples of correspondence from and interviews with these men. Moss researched what would most interest each subject, and cast himself in the role of disciple, admirer, surrogate, or potential victim. In his book Moss said that he had been interested in a career with the FBI. He thought that gaining the trust of a serial killer, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.Moss, J with Jeffrey Kottler: The Last Victim: A True-Life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer, chapter 3. Grand Central Publishing, 1999. Moss forged the strongest relationship with Gacy; their letters led to regular Sunday morning phone calls, during which Gacy reiterated his innocence even as he gave Moss a guided tour of his world. In the book, Moss recounts his correspondence and eventual two meetings with Gacy about two months before the killer was executed. Moss believed that he became Gacy's \\"last victim\\" after this face- to-face meeting in prison, in essence being psychologically overpowered by the manipulative, depraved sociopath. For a time he suffered nightmares from the encounter. Moss felt that this misadventure allowed him to understand how a killer's mind works in controlling the vulnerable and forcing them to submission. He based the title of his book on this episode. Reception The book became a bestseller, selling 76,000 copies in its first 10 weeks. In 2000 the paperback edition also appeared on the Bestseller List of the New York Times. Sales were boosted by controversy over Moss's methods. The author was interviewed on TV's 20/20 and Hard Copy, and radio's The Howard Stern Show. People argued whether Moss was exploiting the lurid histories of these killers or whether he contributed to studies of criminal psychology. Jason Moss committed suicide in June 2006.

He founded numerous patriotic organizations in the late nineteenth century including the Sons of the American Revolution. With expanding international interests, he supported Cuban independence, helped found the League of Peace in 1908 and served as its president. He made his wealth from his investment firm, specializing in railroads, mining, and land speculation. Early life William Osborne McDowell was born on April 10, 1848 in Somerset, New Jersey. He was the son of Dr. Augustus William McDowell and Anna M. (Osborne) McDowell. Career McDowell founded McDowell Brothers and Company in New York City, an investment firm specializing in silver mining, railroads, and land speculation. He reorganized the Montclair Railroad of New Jersey, the New York, Ontario and Western Railway of New Jersey, and the Midland Railroad of New Jersey, and consolidated many others. He was president of the San Antonio Silver Mining Company of Nevada, the Patent Company of Newark and New York, the Coal and Iron Exchange and the Greenwood Lake Improvement Company. Organizations In the late nineteenth century, he became active in civic affairs. McDowell was a founding trustee in 1881 of the American Institute of Christian Philosophy, together with Cornelius Vanderbilt II and several learned ministers. It was intended to promote education in leading questions of religion and science. He founded the Cuban American League of the U.S., which supported the fight for Cuban independence in the late nineteenth century. McDowell initiated the Pan Republic Congress, a business organization that worked for the standardization of international weights and measures, customs regulations, and the resolution of international disputes. His interest in international affairs led him to become a leader in the universal peace movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was among the founders of the Human Freedom League and the League of Peace. In 1908 McDowell drafted a Constitution of the United Nations of the World with political economists.\\"To the United Nations of the World\\" (UNW), Journal of American History, Volume 2, Number 4 The industrialist Andrew Carnegie was also among the founders, and President Theodore Roosevelt supported the League of Peace in a 1910 speech. On October 5, 1912 McDowell as president of the League of Peace, delivered a tribute in London to the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, who dreamed of \\"the Parliament of man, the Federation of world.\\" In 1913 McDowell attended, as a representative of the State of New York, the dedication of the Peace Palace, the site of the International Court of Justice, in The Hague. =Sons of the American Revolution= He also became interested in patriotic organizations following the celebration of the United States Centennial in Philadelphia and New York. He founded the Sons of the American Revolution, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Order of the American Eagle. He became associated with the National Council of Patriotic Organizations and a trustee of its Library Americana, led by Henry Baldwin (1832-1905), another industrialist.\\"Baldwin-McDowell papers, 1862-1917, bulk (1889-1912)\\", New York Public Library, accessed 23 April 2012 McDowell had founded the New Jersey Society of the Sons of the Revolution (SR) in 1889, but he resented the New York Society's insistence at the time that other state societies be \\"auxiliaries\\" to the New York Society. In addition, the New York Society intended the SR to be an elite social organization. McDowell wanted the heritage organization to become a mass movement with broad and generous membership requirements, to recognize descendants of patriots who had a variety of roles in supporting the Revolution - not necessarily in military service. Unwilling to accept the limits imposed by the New York Society, McDowell organized 19 state societies of the SR in early 1889. When the New York Society refused to rescind its policy that societies in other states be auxiliaries of the New York Society, McDowell called a convention of the other state societies at Fraunces Tavern in New York City. At this convention, he founded the Sons of the American Revolution on April 30, 1889 to represent his vision of a broader based society. McDowell was elected president of the new organization the same day. Although efforts were made the reconcile the two organizations, they ultimately were unable to accommodate each other's demands. In April 1891 McDowell became a member of the District of Columbia Society of the SAR but was dropped from membership in 1898. He was assigned national membership number 2013 and District Society membership number 213. He was retroactively assigned national membership number 1 and New Jersey Society membership number 1 at a later date. (This is evidenced by the fact that his New Jersey Society application references his District of Columbia Society application.) McDowell was active in other heritage and patriotic activities: he raised money to complete the Statue of Liberty‚Äôs pedestal, and lobbied for the establishment of a national university in Washington, D.C. He initiated the Columbian Liberty Bell project, which sent a replica of the Liberty Bell on tour throughout the U.S. McDowell was a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of inheritance from his father, Brevet Colonel Augustus William McDowell, who had served as a surgeon in the Union Army. =Daughters of the American Revolution= McDowell also played a role in founding of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in 1890. The DAR was founded by women descendants of Revolutionary-era patriots; they were interested in historic preservation and irritated at having been excluded from the men's organizations. The first President General of the DAR was Caroline Harrison, wife of President Benjamin Harrison. As quickly as the societies formed, differences arose leading to new societies. In 1891 Flora Adams Darling (Vice Regent of the DAR) resigned from the DAR to form the Daughters of the Revolution (DR); it became a more \\"exclusive\\" society, as it would not accept \\"collateral descendants\\" as members and was limited to direct descendants. Her actions were also prompted by what she said were McDowell's ambition to exploit the SAR and DAR as organizations on which to build a presidential campaign. The DR is now defunct and its remaining members may have joined the DAR. Marriage and family McDowell was the son of Dr. Augustus W. McDowell (1820-1878), who served as a surgeon in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Dr. McDowell was commissioned on January 1, 1863 and rose to the rank of brevet colonel in the Union Army. McDowell married Josephine Timanus (1850‚Äì1921) in 1873. They had seven children: Pauline T. McDowell Akins (1874-1968), Nora McDowell Culver (d. 1944), fraternal twins Rachel Kollock McDowell (1880‚Äì1949) and Malcolm McDowell (1880‚Äì1920), William Timanus McDowell, Ezra Osborne McDowell (1886‚Äì1979) and Eulilee McDowell Cook, whom they reared in the Presbyterian Church. (Different surnames for girls are their married names). Their daughter Rachel K. McDowell became a reporter for the Newark Evening News (1902), religious news editor of the New York Herald (1908), and the first Religion Editor of the New York Times in 1920, leading in that position until 1948. \\"Rachel K.

It became the location of the main sewage treatment works for the city in 1884, and is now one of the largest treatment works in Britain. The treatment process was rudimentary, with sludge being removed to ponds and then to drying beds, after which it was used as manure or transferred by rail to a tip at Kilnhurst. The works progressively expanded to improve the quality of effluent discharged to the River Don and was a pioneer in the use of bio-aeration, following experiments by the works manager during the First World War. This process became known as the \\"Sheffield System\\", and was demonstrated to visitors from Great Britain and abroad. Despite these improvements, ammonia levels in the river below the works were high, and fish populations did not survive. The works had its own internal standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives over the course of its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days. A power station was operational on the southern part of the site from 1921, supplying electricity to the steel works of the Lower Don Valley. Although it closed in October 1980, two of its cooling towers which were designed by L. G. Mouchel and Partners in 1937, remained until 2008, as demolition was difficult because of their proximity to Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway across the Don valley. Following extensive upgrading of the treatment works, to improve the quality of discharges to the river still further, the sludge beds became redundant, and have been turned into a nature reserve, providing habitat for migrating birds. Sewage Treatment Works Blackburn Meadows is the lowest point within Sheffield City Council area. The River Don flows out of the city under Templeborough railway bridge past a benchmark set at above sea level. (Rivet at SK40999170) The meadows therefore formed a good site for a sewage treatment works, and Blackburn Meadows works was opened in 1886. It is located on a site to the north of the Don, and to the east of Tinsley Viaduct. In 2006 it was claimed to be the second largest treatment works in the United Kingdom, processing 79 million gallons (360,000 m3) of effluent each day, with only the works at Leeds processing more. =History= As the population of Sheffield increased, Sheffield Corporation bought of land at Blackburn Meadows, on which to build a sewage treatment works. In August 1884, William Bissett and Son won the contract for its construction, which was overseen by Thomas West, who acted as Clerk of Works. of standard gauge railway track connected the limeshed to a junction with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Bissetts had completed their work by January 1886, and although ¬£2,462 had been spent on extras, their final bill came to ¬£23,933, which was ¬£27 cheaper than the original contract value. Savings were made by using concrete for the foundations and bottoms of tanks, rather than brick and puddle clay. Some of the settling tanks at the treatment works By mid-1886, the works was complete, and the Mayor, J. W. Pye-Smith Esq, officially opened it on 2 June. The event was witnessed by members of the Council, and by invited guests, which included a representative from the London Metropolitan Board of Works. Reports at the time indicated that the sewage passed through catch pits by gravity, allowing solids to settle, which were removed weekly. Milk of lime was then added as it flowed through mixing channels, after which it entered rectangular settling tanks. Next it passed on to a number of precipitating tanks, each holding , where after 30 minutes of settling, it passed over aerating weirs. Finally it ran through coke filters and was discharged into the river. Around of sludge was removed from the precipitating tanks each day, to be pumped into ponds. Once the water had drained off, it was moved to drying beds, and was then used as manure by farmers, or was taken by rail to a tip at Kilnhurst, near Rotherham. Initially, there were 30 precipitating tanks and 60 aerating or filtering tanks. The railway also developed, with the acquisition of of portable track and six tipping wagons in 1889, a steam crane later the same year, and more wagons in 1891 and 1892. The first locomotive arrived in 1898, after its purchase from the Yorkshire Engine Company. It was an 0-4-0 saddle tank, which had been built in 1875 for use as a contractor's engine, and had been refurbished by the manufacturer. A maintenance contract for the wagons lapsed in 1900, as the men at the works had become proficient at repairs. In parallel with the construction of the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall. =Expansion= Jordan Bridge, which carried the internal railway over the River Don Navigation to reach the sludge beds The quality of the effluent discharged into the Don was soon giving rise to concern, as the treatment process was unsatisfactory. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1900, which allowed Sheffield Corporation to buy an additional , on which contact beds would be built, so that the effluent could be better treated before discharge. The initial plan was costed at ¬£367,355, which was reduced to ¬£270,369 when secondary contact beds were removed from the scheme. The Local Government Board approved the plans on 13 May 1905, paving the way for the construction of a biological treatment system, instead of the system using lime. Logan and Hemmingway, who were contractors based at Nottingham, won the initial contract for excavations, and also the subsequent one for the construction of six settling tanks, 24 contact tanks, and Jordan bridge, which would carry the internal railway line over the River Don Navigation. The contract was worth ¬£41,046, and further contracts followed, which included ¬£36,500 for 36 more contact beds and three settling tanks, ¬£5,000 for excavating of earth, and ¬£36,484 for storm beds and other work, which was subsequently raised to ¬£39,184, so that they could pay their workers at the same rate as Sheffield Corporation paid their own workmen. The Lord Mayor opened the first part of the new works on 28 October 1909, and Sheffield Council increased the amount of land they owned for sewage treatment to by buying another , on which contact beds could be constructed if required at a later date. Discharges to the river were still of poor quality, and a secondary treatment process was designed, although its implementation was delayed by the onset of the First World War. However, John Haworth became works manager in 1914, and began to experiment with ways to treat the effluent. A continuous narrow channel was constructed within a tank, and paddles were used to agitate the liquid. This allowed it to become oxygenated, which supported bacteria, allowing them to digest the sewage. The process was called bio-aeration, but became known as the \\"Sheffield System\\", and a steady stream of people came to inspect the works, both from local authorities in Great Britain and from overseas. Many of the contact beds were converted to use the new system between 1922 and 1927. The treatment process significantly reduced the biochemical oxygen demand of the effluent discharged to the river, but was not good at removing ammonia, which was a major contributor to the poor water quality of the river below the works, and the destruction of the fish populations. The effluent regularly contained more than 20 mg/l of ammonia, which resulted in levels of over 10 mg/l in the river. Few fish can survive in concentrations of over 2 mg/l. In 1915, the Corporation had made enquiries about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, which was built at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961. =Modernisation= The entire works was upgraded between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The plan was announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost ¬£1 million. The first phase was the construction of a filter pressing plant, for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake did not have to be taken to Thrybergh to be dumped. The railway was also upgraded at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, and a new 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's to see if they would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963. In 1976, a new diesel shunting locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It was built at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line from there to the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of a very small number of isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewers were inadequate for the volume of effluent, and overflowed into the river during periods of light rainfall and sometimes when there was no rainfall. Some of them had been in use for 80 years, and inspection revealed that major reconstruction was required. The solution adopted was to tunnel the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer through the Carboniferous rock beneath the existing sewers. Work began of the first phase in 1979, when of tunnel were built from the works to a drop shaft in Hawke Street. A new pumping station was required at Blackburn Meadows, and this phase was completed in July 1983. Over the next decade, four further phases were completed, involving the tunnelling of of sewer with a diameter of to a drop shaft near Furnival Road, a new sewer from Furnival Road to the Whitbread Brewery with another from the Sheaf Valley sewer to the central bus station, extension of the Don Valley sewer to Gilpin Street, and finally extension from Gilpin Street to Livesey Street in Hillsborough. As a result of this work, the capacity of the sewers was greatly increased, and 26 storm sewage overflows were closed, resulting in significant improvement to water quality in the river. =Improvements= Diagram of the sewage sludge incineration process In 1992, the problem of ammonia levels in the final effluent was addressed by the construction of a system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive. The outflow from the works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, has in the past been a major contributor to the pollution of the River Don, but some ¬£70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to the river meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000 m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point. The works was shut down on 25 June 2007, after the Don burst its banks, and the entire site was engulfed by several feet of water. It remained submerged for over a week, with much of the equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The analyser which measures emissions from the incinerator plant had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation. In 2012, a contract for the construction of a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units. Power Station The cooling towers prior to demolition In 1921, Sheffield Corporation built a coal-fired power station on spare land at the south west corner of Blackburn Meadows. At the time there was no national grid, and the steelworks which occupied much of the Lower Don Valley needed additional electrical power. The chosen site was close to the steel works, was near the river, which supplied cooling water, and was well-served by railway lines, to deliver coal.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1923 (available here ) The station was modified between 1937 and 1942, when its capacity was increased to 72 Megawatts, and remained operational until the 1980s. When the rest of the power station was demolished, two of its seven cooling towers were left standing due to their close proximity to the M1 motorway, and the risk that their demolition might cause Tinsley Viaduct to be damaged. The towers were hyperbolic in shape, and were designed by L. G. Mouchel and Partners, who had also been responsible for the first such towers erected at Liverpool in 1925. The Blackburn Meadows towers were built between 1937 and 1938. English Heritage considered whether they should be designated as listed structures, but ruled against it because the internal cooling structures had been removed, and there was no context for them, as the rest of the station no longer existed. On 24 August 2008, at 3 am, the two landmark towers were finally demolished with explosives, without damaging the motorway. In 2011, as part of Sheffield City Council's drive to become self-sufficient for energy, construction of a biomass power station began. It is operated by E.ON UK, and was completed in 2014. It generates 30 megawatts by burning waste wood, sourced from the United Kingdom, and waste heat is captured to provide a district heating scheme. Nature Reserve In 1993 Sheffield City Council negotiated with Yorkshire Water and leased an unused part of the former sewage works for 99 years, at an annual rent of one peppercorn, to enable it to be reclaimed and turned into a nature reserve. In order to manage the project, a consortium was formed, with representation from Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wildlife Trust, South Yorkshire Forest and Yorkshire Water. It now provides habitat for migrating birds, for which it is an area of European significance. The Wildlife Trust run an active programme of school education visits. In 2005 the City Council exercised an option to increase the size of the reserve by taking over additional land from Yorkshire Water.

Due to the similarity in symptoms, VCD attack are often mistaken for asthma attacks or laryngospasms. Symptoms of VCD are not always present. Rather, they often occur episodically, often defined as \\"attacks,\\" where the sufferer will be symptomatic for a short period of time. Although several contributing factors have been identified, the exact cause of VCD is unknown. Diagnosis of VCD may include a series of evaluations including pulmonary function tests, medical imaging, and the evaluation or visualization of the vocal folds during an episode through the use of videolaryngoscopy. Such evaluations can also help to rule out other conditions that can affect the upper and lower airway. Treatment of VCD often combines behavioural, medical and psychological approaches, most often including an otolaryngologist, a psychologist, and a Speech-Language Pathologist. Although information on the incidence and prevalence of VCD is limited, it is known to occur most frequently in young women.  Signs and symptoms  Many of the symptoms are not limited to the disorder, as they may resemble a number of conditions that affect the upper and lower airway. Such conditions include asthma, angioedema, vocal cord tumors, and vocal cord paralysis.Benninger C; Parsons JP; Mastronarde JG (2011-01-01). \\"Vocal cord dysfunction and asthma.\\". Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine. 17 (1): 45‚Äì9. ISSN 1070‚Äì5287. People with vocal cord dysfunction often complain of \\"difficulty in breathing in‚Äù or ‚Äúfighting for breath‚Äù, which can lead to subjective respiratory distress, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. They may report tightness in the throat or chest, choking, stridor on inhalation and wheezing, which can resemble the symptoms of asthma. These episodes of dyspnea can be recurrent and symptoms can range from mild to severe and prolonged in some cases. Agitation and a sense of panic are not uncommon and can result in hospitalization. Different subtypes of vocal cord dysfunction are characterized by additional symptoms. For instance, momentary aphonia can be caused by laryngospasm, an involuntary spasm of the vocal cords and a strained or hoarse voice may be perceived when the vocal cord dysfunction occurs during speech. Many of the symptoms are not specific to vocal cord dysfunction and can resemble a number of conditions that affect the upper and lower airway. =Presentation= Open vocal cords as seen during normal inhalation Closed vocal cords as seen during a VCD episode (or when speaking)VCD can mimic asthma, anaphylaxis, collapsed lungs, pulmonary embolism, or fat embolism, which can lead to an inaccurate diagnosis and inappropriate, potentially harmful, treatment. Some incidences of VCD are misdiagnosed as asthma, but are unresponsive to asthma therapy, including bronchodilators and steroids. Among adult patients, women tend to be diagnosed more often. Among children and teenage patients, VCD has been linked with high participation in competitive sports and family orientation towards high achievement. Vocal cord dysfunction co-occurs with asthma approximately 40% of the time. This frequently results in a misdiagnosis of asthma alone. Even young children can tell the difference between an asthma attack (primarily difficulty exhaling) and a VCD attack (primarily difficulty inhaling). Knowing the difference between the two will help those who have both know when to use the rescue inhaler prescribed or when to use the breathing recovery exercises trained by a speech-language pathologist. Episodes can be triggered suddenly or develop gradually and triggers are numerous. Primary causes are believed to be gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), extra-esophageal reflux (EERD), exposure to inhaled allergens, post-nasal drip, exercise, or neurological conditions that can cause difficulty inhaling only during waking. Published studies emphasize anxiety or stress as a primary cause while more recent literature indicates a likely physical etiology. This disorder has been observed from infancy through old age, with the observation of its occurrence in infants leading some to believe that a physiological cause such as reflux or allergy is likely. Certain medications, such as antihistamines for allergies, cause drying of the mucous membranes, which can cause further irritation or hypersensitivity of the vocal cords. = Potential comorbidities = VCD has long been strongly associated with a variety of psychological or psychogenic factors, including conversion disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety (especially in adolescents), stress (particularly stress relating to competitive sports), physical and sexual abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, factitious disorder and adjustment disorder. It is important to note that anxiety and depression may occur in certain patients as a result of having VCD, rather than being the cause of it. Psychological factors are important precipitating factors for many patients with VCD; although exercise is also a major trigger for episodes of VCD, some patients experience VCD co-occurring with anxiety regardless of whether or not they are physically active at the time of the VCD/anxiety episode. Experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event related to breathing (such as a near-drowning or life-threatening asthma attack, for example), has also been identified as a risk factor for VCD. VCD has also been associated with certain neurologic diseases including Arnold-Chiari malformation, cerebral aqueduct stenosis, cortical or upper motor neuron injury (such as that resulting from stroke), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), parkinsonism syndromes and other movement disorders. However, this association occurs only rarely. In addition, it has been associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, a group of connective tissue disorders.  Causes  The exact cause of VCD is not known, and it is unlikely that a single underlying cause exists. Several contributing factors have been identified, which vary widely among VCD patients with different medical histories. Physical exercise (including, but not limited to, competitive athletics) is one of the major triggers for VCD episodes, leading to its frequent misdiagnosis as exercise-induced asthma. Other triggers include airborne pollutants and irritants such as smoke, dust, gases, soldering fumes, cleaning chemicals such as ammonia, perfumes, and other odours. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity) may also play a role in inflaming the airway and leading to symptoms of VCD as discussed below. Laryngeal hyperresponsiveness is considered the most likely physiologic cause of VCD, brought on by a range of different triggers that cause inflammation and/or irritation of the larynx (voice box). The glottic closure reflex (or laryngeal adductor reflex) serves to protect the airway, and it is possible that this reflex becomes hyperactive in some individuals, resulting in the paradoxical vocal fold closure seen in VCD. Two major causes of laryngeal inflammation and hyperresponsiveness are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and postnasal drip (associated with rhinosinusitis, allergic or nonallergic rhinitis, or a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI)). Rhinosinusitis is very common among patients with VCD and for many patients, VCD symptoms are ameliorated when the rhinosinusitis is treated. GERD is also common among VCD patients, but only some experience an improvement in VCD symptoms when GERD is treated. Other causes of laryngeal hyperresponsiveness include inhalation of toxins and irritants, cold and dry air, episodic croup and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).  Risk factors  The following increase an individual's chances for acquiring VCD: * Upper airway inflammation (allergic or non-allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, recurrent upper respiratory infections) * Gastroesophageal reflux disease * Past traumatic event that involved breathing (e.g. near-drowning, suffocation) * Severe emotional trauma or distress * Female gender * Playing a wind instrument * Playing a competitive or elite sport  Diagnosis  The most effective diagnostic strategy is to perform laryngoscopy during an episode, at which time abnormal movement of the cords, if present, can be observed. If the endoscopy is not performed during an episode, it is likely that the vocal folds will be moving normally, a 'false negative' finding. Spirometry may also be useful to establish the diagnosis of VCD when performed during a crisis or after a nasal provocation test. With spirometry, just as the expiratory loop may show flattening or concavity when expiration is affected in asthma, so may the Inspiratory loop show truncation or flattening in VCD. Of course, testing may well be negative when symptoms are absent. = Differential diagnosis = The symptoms of VCD are often inaccurately attributed to asthma, which in turn results in the unnecessary and futile intake of corticosteroids, bronchodilators and leukotriene modifiers, although there are instances of comorbidity of asthma and VCD. The differential diagnosis for vocal cord dysfunction includes vocal fold swelling from allergy, asthma, or some obstruction of the vocal folds or throat. Anyone suspected of this condition should be evaluated and the vocal folds (voice box) visualized. In individuals who experience a persistent difficulty with inhaling, consideration should be given to a neurological cause such as brain stem compression, cerebral palsy, etc. The main difference between VCD and asthma is the audible stridor or wheezing that occurs at different stages of the breath cycle: VCD usually causes stridor on the inhalation, while asthma results in wheezing during exhalation. Patients with asthma usually respond to the usual medication and see their symptoms resolve. Clinical measures that can be done to differentiate VCD from asthma include: * rhinolaryngoscopy: A patient with asthma will have normal vocal cord movement, while one with VCD will display vocal cord abduction during inhalation * spirometry: A change in the measure following the administration of a bronchodilator is suggestive of asthma rather than VCD * chest radiography: The presence of hyperinflation and peribronchial thickening are indicative of asthma, as patients with VCD will show normal results.  Treatments  Once a diagnosis of VCD has been confirmed by a medical professional, a specific treatment plan can be implemented. If vocal cord dysfunction is secondary to an underlying condition, such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or postnasal drip, it is important to treat the primary condition as this will help control VCD symptoms. Conventional treatments for VCD are often multidisciplinary and include speech-language pathology, psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, use of anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications, medical interventions, and hypnotherapy. There is no uniform approach. The information from randomized, blinded studies is limited. =Behavioral approaches= Speech-language pathologists provide behavioral treatment of VCD. Speech therapy usually involves educating the client on the nature of the problem, what happens when symptoms are present, and then comparing this to what happens during normal breathing and phonation. Intervention goals target teaching a client breathing and relaxation exercises so that they can control their throat muscles and keep the airway open, allowing air to flow in and out. Breathing techniques can be taught to reduce tension in the throat, neck, and upper body and bring attention to the flow of air during respiration. Diaphragm support during breathing decreases muscle tension in the larynx. These techniques are meant to move awareness away from the act of breathing in and focus on the auditory feedback provided by the air moving in and out. Other techniques can involve breathing through a straw and panting, which widens the opening of the throat by activating the Posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle. Endoscopic feedback can also be used to show a patient what is happening when they are doing simple tasks such as taking a deep breath or speaking on an inspiration. This provides the client with visual information so that they can actually see what behaviours help to open the throat and what behaviors constrict the throat. Respiratory muscle strength training, a form of increased resistance training using a hand-held breathing device has also been reported to alleviate symptoms. Speech therapy has been found to eliminate up to 90% of ER visits in patients suffering from VCD. =Medical approaches= Medical often works in conjunction with behavioral approaches. A pulmonary or ENT (otolaryngologist) specialist will screen for and address any potential underlying pathology that may be associated with VCD. Managing GERD has also been found to relieve laryngospasm, a spasm of the vocal cords that makes breathing and speaking difficult. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation can be used if a patient's vocal cords adduct (close) during exhalation. Mild sedatives have also been employed to reduce anxiety as well as reduce acute symptoms of VCD. Benzodiazepines are an example of one such treatment, though they have been linked to a risk of suppression of the respiratory drive. While Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, does not suppress respiratory drive, it has been thought to be associated with laryngospasms. For more severe VCD cases, physicians may inject botulinum toxin into the vocal (thyroarytenoid) muscles to weaken or decrease muscle tension. Nebulized Lignocaine can also been used in acute cases and helium- oxygen inhalation given by face mask has been used in cases of respiratory distress. =Psychological approaches= Psychological interventions including psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), Biofeedback, and teaching self-hypnosis are also suggested to treat VCD. Intervention is generally targeted at making the client aware of stressors that may trigger VCD symptoms, to implement strategies to reduce stress and anxiety, and to teach techniques for coping with their symptoms. CBT can focus on bringing awareness to negative thought patterns and help reframe them by focusing on problem solving strategies. Psychologists may also use relaxation to reduce distress when a patient is experiencing symptoms. Biofeedback can be a helpful addition to psychotherapy. The aim of Biofeedback is to educate the client on what happens to the vocal cords during breathing and to help them learn to control their symptoms. Choosing an intervention strategy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team and individualized therapy planned carefully, keeping the characteristics of each patient in mind.  Prognosis  The natural prognosis of VCD in both children and adults is not well described in the literature. Additionally, there is currently no research that has studied whether the underlying cause of VCD makes a difference in the resolution of symptoms or in the long-term prognosis of the impairment. Information on the prognosis of VCD after acute therapies is also limited. Minimal response has been documented with the continued treatment of asthma in people with VCD using inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids and other asthma medications. While using Botox in VCD has limited reports, those that are available report successful resolution of exercise-induced VCD symptoms for up to 2 months. Outcomes of chronic VCD treatment are similarly limited. When pediatric patients undergoing hypnosis therapy were studied, more than half saw either a reduction or resolution of VCD. Even though it is widely used, no long-term studies have been done to study the prognosis of VCD after psychotherapy. Speech therapy is the main course of treatment for long-term management of VCD and includes a variety of techniques such as relaxed-throat breathing, respiratory retraining therapy, and vocal hygiene counselling. Most studies agree that symptoms of VCD improve in patients and few continue to require asthma medications six months post speech therapy intervention. Significant improvements were reported for respiratory retraining therapy, including fewer episodes of dyspnea per month and decreased respiratory stress severity. For those adolescent patients who recovered from VCD, the average time before the symptoms were resolved was 4‚Äì5 months. However, some adolescents had VCD symptoms even 5 years post VCD onset, regardless of intervention. It has been noted that some patients do not respond to standard VCD therapies and continue to express recurrent symptoms.  Epidemiology  There is currently a limited amount of information available on the incidence and prevalence of VCD, and the various rates reported in the literature are most likely an underestimate. Although VCD is thought to be rare overall, its prevalence among the population at large is not known. However, numerous studies have been conducted on its incidence and prevalence among patients presenting with asthma and exertional dyspnea. A VCD incidence rate of 2% has been reported among patients whose primary complaint was either asthma or dyspnea; the same incidence rate has also been reported among patients with acute asthma exacerbation. Meanwhile, much higher VCD incidence rates have also been reported in asthmatic populations, ranging from 14% in children with refractory asthma to 40% in adults with the same complaint. It has also been reported that the VCD incidence rate is as high as 27% in non-asthmatic teenagers and young adults. Data on the prevalence of VCD is also limited. An overall prevalence of 2.5% has been reported in patients presenting with asthma. Among adults with asthma considered \\"difficult to control\\", 10% were found to have VCD while 30% were found to have both VCD and asthma. Among children with severe asthma, a VCD prevalence rate of 14% has been reported. However, higher rates have also been reported; among one group of schoolchildren thought to suffer from exercise-induced asthma, it was found that 26.9% actually had VCD and not asthma. Among intercollegiate athletes with exercise-induced asthma, the VCD rate has been estimated at 3%. In patients presenting with symptoms of dyspnea, prevalence rates ranging from 2.8% to 22% have been reported in various studies. It has been reported that two to three times more females than males suffer from VCD. VCD is especially common in females who suffer from psychological problems. There is an increased risk associated with being young and female. Among patients suffering from VCD, 71% are over the age of 18. In addition, 73% of those with VCD have a previous psychiatric diagnosis. VCD has also been reported in newborns with gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD).

Settlement 300px 300px During the American War of Independence, British colonial authorities began to strategically engage in relationships with the Native people of present-day Ontario, seeking to acquire and settled their territories for the purpose of defending British North America. The Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe in the early nineteenth century consisted of several bands. Two groups, led by William Yellowhead and Joseph Snake, occupied areas of southernmost Simcoe County, which they relinquished to the government in 1818. A third group, led by John Aisance, occupied areas between Kempenfelt Bay and Penetanguishene, which they surrendered to the government in 1815. In 1830 the government set aside Georgina Island, Snake Island and Fox Island, all in Lake Simcoe, as a reservation for these groups, but encouraged them to settle instead in purpose-built villages at Coldwater (where Aisance and his people settled) and Atherley Narrows (where Yellowhead and Snake settled) where they might take up farming. The corridor of Crown land between Lake Couchiching, and the Severn River was informally given to the Chippewas as a hunting ground, but in 1836 a deal was struck to return this territory (including the two villages) to government hands, leaving the Chippewas with the Lake Simcoe islands as their last remaining reservation. Yellowhead and his band purchased land at Rama and settled there in 1838, whereas Aisance led his people to Beausoleil Island in Georgian Bay in 1842, from which they relocated to Christian Island in 1856. As part of this final dispersal of the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe, some remained behind on Snake Island and the neighbouring islands with Snake as their leader. The role of the colonial government had a significant impact on the people, enforcing a policy to enrol the people and grow dependent on the crown. The influence of this policy resulted in repeated promises of protection, food, clothing, lodgings and general welfare of the people. The transformation from a strong and independent people to one of complete dependence for the most part resulted. The area between Lake Ontario, Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe represented a region of prime military vulnerability and defence for Upper Canada.http://www.georginaisland.com This region was not only occupied by the Lake Simcoe Indians, but also the people under the leadership of Joseph Brant of the Six Nations.

Van Horne, \\"Memoir of a French Visitor: du Pratz, History of Louisiana\\", Discovering Lewis & Clark was an ethnographer, historian, and naturalist who is best known for his Histoire de la Louisiane. It was first published in twelve installments from 1751‚Äì1753 in the Journal Economique, then completely in three volumes in Paris in 1758. After their victory in the Seven Years' War, the English published part of it in translation in 1763. It has never been fully translated into English. The memoir recounts Le Page's years in the Louisiana colony from 1718 to 1734, when he learned the Natchez language and befriended native leaders. He gives lengthy descriptions of Natchez society and its culture, including the funeral rituals associated with the 1725 death of Tattooed Serpent, the second-highest ranking chief among the people. It also includes his account of Moncacht-ap√©, a Yazoo explorer who told him of completing travel to the Pacific Coast and back, likely in the late 17th or early 18th century. Through this traveler, Le Page learned of oral traditions held by indigenous people of the West Coast. They told of the first Native Americans reaching North America by a land bridge from Asia. Le Page's book was carried as a guide by the Lewis and Clark Expedition as it explored the Louisiana Purchase starting in 1804. Early life Le Page Du Pratz was born in 1695 either in the Netherlands or France, and was raised in the latter country. He was educated, graduating from a French cours de mathematiques, and identified as an engineer and professional architect. Serving with Louis XIV‚Äôs dragoons in the French Army, he entered conflict in Germany in 1713 during the War of the Spanish Succession. On 25 May 1718, Le Page left La Rochelle, France, with 800 men on one of three ships bound for Louisiana. He arrived on 25 August 1718. Le Page lived in La Louisiane from 1718 to 1734; about half of the period, 1720 to 1728, he lived near Fort Rosalie and Natchez on the Mississippi River. He had land and cultivated tobacco; in New Orleans he had bought two slaves, as well as a Chitimacha woman as a companion. She likely bore his children. In Natchez he learned the language of the Natchez people, whose homeland this was, and befriended local native leaders. When Le Page wrote his memoir more than a decade after returning to France, he used the verbatim words of many of his Native informants, rather than describing the \\"manners and customs of the Indians\\" in the detached fashion of so many later colonial authors. Because of his own interest in the origins of Native Americans, Le Page was especially attentive to the account by the Yazoo explorer Moncacht-ap√©. He had traveled to the Pacific coast and back (a century before the later Lewis & Clark Expedition sponsored by the young United States). Le Page devoted three entire chapters to the Yazoo man's account of his travels. Moncacht-ap√© was curious about the origins of his people and traveled to learn more. When he reached the Pacific coast, Moncacht-ap√© heard Native oral histories that referred to an ancient land bridge from Asia.Gordon M. Sayre, \\"A Native American Scoops Lewis and Clark\\" , Common-Place, vol. 5 (4) July 2005, accessed 3 May 2009 Carte de la Louisiane, or Map of Louisiana, Histoire de la Louisiane (1757) Le Page lived at Natchez from 1720 to 1728 under the colonization scheme organized by John Law and the Company of the Indies. His familiarity with the local Natchez, and knowledge of their language and customs, is the basis for some of the unique aspects of his writings. He returned to New Orleans in 1728 to take an appointment as manager of the Company's plantation across from the river from the city; he managed 200 slaves in the cultivation of tobacco. By this move, he avoided being killed in the so-called Natchez Rebellion or Natchez Massacre of 1729. Tensions and retaliatory attacks had escalated as European settlers encroached on Indian territory. During the uprising by the Natchez, Chickasaw and Yazoo, which Le Page described in detail, the Natives destroyed Fort Rosalie and killed nearly all of the male French colonists there. The Native Americans did not kill enslaved Africans or French women and children, whom they took as captives.Ginny Walker English, \\"Natchez Massacre 1729\\", State Coordinator, Mississippi American Local History Network, 2000‚Äì2003, accessed 3 May 2009 After the massacre, the French king ended the concession of the Company of the Indies and seized control of the plantation which Le Page was managing. French troops with Indian allies retaliated and attacked, putting down the Natchez Rebellion by 1731. They sold several hundred captive Indians into slavery and transported them to their colony of Saint-Domingue in the Caribbean, which was developed by slave labor for sugar cane plantations.\\"Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz: A Biographical Outline\\", University of Oregon, accessed 3 May 2009 Le Page du Pratz also wrote about the supposed Samba Rebellion of 1731, in which he allegedly participated in arresting the conspiratorial slaves. Writings Le Page du Pratz waited more than fifteen years after his return to France before he wrote and published his memoir of Louisiana. The Memoire sur la Louisiane was published by installments between September 1751 and February 1753 in the Journal Oeconomique (Economic Journal), a Paris periodical devoted to scientific and commercial topics. In 1758 the three octavo volumes of the Histoire de la Louisiane were published. Part of the book was devoted to his ethnographic descriptions of the Native peoples of Louisiana, particularly the Natchez. His account included descriptions of the funeral of the Tattooed Serpent, the second-highest ranking chief, with drawings of the funeral procession and people offering themselves for sacrifice. Other sections described the history of the colony, from the Spanish and French explorers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries through establishment of the French settlements along the Mississippi.Gordon Sayre, \\"Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, The History of Louisiana (L'Histoire de la Louisiane (1758)), accessed 3 May 2009 The title page to the one-volume English edition of 1774 which Benjamin Smith Barton loaned to Meriwether Lewis to take on the expedition of 1804‚Äì06. In 1763 after the British had defeated France in the Seven Years' War, an English translation of part of Le Page du Pratz's work was published in London.

They are common in the Cordillera highlands of Luzon in the northern Philippines. Most Gangsa are brass although some more recent ones, especially from the end of the 19th century, are cast iron. The iron ones are generally considered inferior to the \\"gold\\" ones. Gangsa are endemic throughout the Cordilleras in Luzon, the main island of the northern Philippines. They seem to have been there for centuries, and some families still treasure family heirlooms from 8 or 9 generations ago. These parts of the Philippines were not subdued by the Spanish during their four century claim over the Philippines. Fukkien traders appear to have been active in the Cordilleras before the Spanish imperium, and to have continued through the Spanish attempts to rule. Current thinking is the Fukkien traders brought the flat sided lipped gongs from China to sell to the Cordillera people who paid in gold. Gangsa are usually found in sets of five or six, based on the pentatonic scale. They can be tuned by an expert with a hammer. Sets of eight or more are also common, but are still based on the pentatonic scale also thought to have been brought from China. Current (2008) retail price in Baguio for a new set of five in brass is about 78,000 pesos. The people of Mountain Province use Gangsa during all major traditional celebrations and its use does not seem in danger of being lost. In the more remote barios of Kalinga Province, gungsa are still essential for all community celebrations, unless someone has died recently, when the gungsa remain silent. Unlike the Southern Philippines, playing gongs in the Cordilleras is a male duty. Girls are often taught to play Gangsa at school, alongside the boys, but do not play at community functions. They usually dance to the sound of the Gangsa. Methods of playing Gangsa vary from tribe to tribe and can be quite intricate when played by masters. The Kalinga people in the Cordillera region of Luzon Island play the Gangsa in two methods. One way is called \\"Tuppaya\\" and the other is called \\"Pattong.\\" In \\"Tuppaya\\" style, the musicians play the surface of the gangsa with their hand while in a sitting position, with a single gangsa resting on the lap of each musician. In the \\"Pattong\\" style, a gangsa is suspended from the musician's left hand and played with a padded stick held in the musician's right hand. In the \\"Pattong\\" style of playing, the players are standing, or they keep in step with the dancers while bending forward slightly.

The episodes deal with President Bartlet's decision to run for re-election, and the activities of the weeks leading up to his official announcement. Both parts were written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Thomas Schlamme, and the episodes contain the first appearances by Ron Silver, Evan Handler and Connie Britton. These episodes also mark the first episode where Stockard Channing is added to opening credits, marking that she became a regular character this season. The second episode was an Emmy nominee for Outstanding Art Direction For A Single-Camera Series. It also earned a Golden Reel Award nomination for Best Sound Editing in a Television Series. Plot The episode picks up at the press conference immediately where last season's cliff-hanger (Two Cathedrals) left off, and what was then only implicit is here made clear: President Bartlet is running for a second term. When asked if he plans to seek re-election, he answers \\"Yeah, and I'm gonna win.\\" From that point on the story develops in dual storylines, one following immediately upon the press conference, the other taking place four weeks later, as the staff is preparing for the official campaign announcement in Manchester, New Hampshire. Leo decides to bring in Bruno Gianelli (Silver), a highly accomplished political consultant, to help with the re-election campaign, but conflict soon arises between Gianelli's and Bartlet's respective staffs. The conflict is particularly intense between the idealistic Communications Director Toby and the more pragmatic Doug Wegland (Handler). A problem appears when it becomes clear that RU-486 - an emergency contraception - will receive government approval on the same day as the announcement ceremony. This will not only take attention away from the event, but also give political ammunition to the Right, and raise questions about the professionalism of the campaign. Josh strongly wants to \\"wave off the FDA\\" on the release, and it later appears that his underlying motive for this is to rectify a previous mistake. In the early part of the story, he applied pressure to pass a bill on anti-tobacco measures, but Gianelli points out the error in passing a bill that could have given them political leverage against the Republicans in the upcoming election. In the ongoing conflict in Haiti, a rescue mission is staged to save American citizens. Bartlet decides to send in peacekeeping troops, in spite of political consequences. CJ then, when announcing the decision to the press, makes a grave mistake by saying that she thinks \\"the president's relieved to be focusing on something that matters\\", implying both that the MS incident was unimportant and that the President was happy to use an incident in which American lives are at risk to deflect attention away from his illness. Leo responds by sitting her out for the next press briefing, and she reacts by offering her resignation. Yet she is eventually persuaded to stay by the president's heartfelt assurance that he considers her a vital member of the administration. Bartlet's wife Abbey is not pleased with the president making his bid for re-election without consulting her. Later on she still decides to join him in Manchester. She tells him that he needs to reach out to his staff, some of whom believe that he should make a public apology for concealing his MS. In the end he makes the apology, not publicly, but privately to his nearest advisors. He assures them that, even though Gianelli's help is much needed, they will still run a campaign that does not shrink from handling controversial issues. In a final speech he tells them that \\"We're gonna write a new book. Right here. Right now.\\" Production and cultural references The scenes purporting to be in Manchester were not shot in New Hampshire, in spite of lobbying from local residents.\\"In 2001, a Bartlett descendant joined New Hampshire Magazine in a campaign to persuade the show's producers to film certain scenes in New Hampshire\\": Cited at John Spencer, who played Leo McGarry on the show, said: \\"I certainly understand where the people from New Hampshire are coming from. But I think it's logistics. New Hampshire is not close enough\\". For financial reasons the producers decided to film the outside parts of the episodes in Bluemont, Virginia instead. The town was said to have the \\"quiet streets, a mix of mostly older architectural styles, fieldstone fences, and breathtaking views of rolling countryside\\" that the show was looking for. The house chosen - out of 55 contenders - to pass as the president's farmhouse, was the home of Purcellville mayor John Marsh. Marsh's friends and neighbours also appear as extras in the crowd scenes. For the sub-plot about the morning-after pill, former Clinton economic advisor Gene Sperling was brought in for consultation. Such a drug, called Mifepristone, was in fact approved in the United States in September 2000; one of the last months of the Clinton presidency. Also the political issues related to Haiti have close parallels to an episode in the Clinton presidency: the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power by the United States in 1994. Reception The second episode was an Emmy nominee for Outstanding Art Direction For A Single-Camera Series. It also earned a Golden Reel Award nomination for Best Sound Editing in Television Series. The two episodes were also nominated for Series Storyline at the 2002 SHINE Awards, a prize awarded for \\"accurate and honest portrayals of sexuality\\". Jenny Halper, writing for UGO, was less than impressed with the pre-season special episode, and wrote that \\"the season really kicks off\\" with the \\"flashback intensive\\" \\"Manchester\\"-episodes. Britt Gillette, of The DVD Report, counted \\"Manchester Part I\\" among the more dramatic episodes on the show, with special reference to C.J.'s blunder, and the debate over the president's apology. Deborah of Television Without Pity gave both episodes the grade \\"A\\". The A.V. Club's Steve Heisler gave the two episodes a B+. He believed these two episodes were \\"meant to center the characters and the audience\\" after the previous season, ending in the season finale \\"Two Cathedrals\\". \\"And like most things on The West Wing,\\" he continued, \\"it‚Äôs a long, messy, spectacular road to a perfect (likely quippy) end.\\" References External links *Manchester Part I and Part II at NBC.com *Manchester Part I and Part II at The West Wing Episode Guide *Manchester Part I and Part II at The West Wing Continuity Guide *Manchester Part I and Part II at the Internet Movie Database Category:The West Wing (season 3) episodes Category:2001 American television episodes ","title":"Manchester (The West Wing)"},{"id":"18209787","text":"Arthur B.

Barret was born on his family farm in Sangamon County, Illinois near the state capital of Springfield. He was educated at various private schools including Phillips Academy and Saint Louis University. As he reached adulthood, he moved to a farm across the Missouri River from Hermann, Missouri to raise cattle. A few years later, he moved to St. Louis where he met and married his wife, Miss Anna F. Swerengen, in June 1859 with whom he had three children. Shortly after the American Civil War, Barret succeeded his cousin, Colonel J. Richard Barret, to become president of the St. Louis Agricultural and Mechanical Association, a group that organized many large fairs held on the lands that would become Fairground Park in St. Louis. He resigned from the post in 1874. He was a candidate for mayor several times before the St. Louis Democratic Convention: he was defeated three times in 1869, 1871, and 1873, the latter two which he was defeated by 3 votes and 1 vote, respectively. Finally, in 1875, Barret was nominated by the Democratic Convention without any opposition. On April 6, he was elected mayor of St. Louis having defeated Henry Overstolz with a large majority of the vote. Barret was inaugurated as mayor of St. Louis on April 13, 1875. Four days later, he fell severely ill. The illness proved fatal and he died on April 24, 1875 having served only 11 days as mayor. Barret was buried at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.

The family was closely related to the Date clan of Sendai Domain through intermarriage.Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d'histoire et de g√©ographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). (\\"Shiba,\\" Nobiliare du Japon, p. 59 [PDF 63 of 80]; retrieved 2013-5-3. Origins The Tamura clan claimed descent from Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, and were local g≈çzoku controlling Tamura sh≈çen (later Tamura District) in what is now central Fukushima Prefecture since the Heian period. Sengoku period The clan rose to become a minor daimy≈ç during the Sengoku period. In 1504, the Tamura clan moved from Moriyama to Miharu Castle in what is now Miharu, Fukushima. As a defense network, the clan set up its retainers in forty-eight subsidiary castles and outposts in the area. However, although the Tamura clan pledged allegiance to Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Siege of Odawara, Hideyoshi felt that their efforts were insufficient, and dispossessed the clan in 1598, giving their territory to the Date clan. The Tamura survived as retainers to the Date. Edo period The wife of Date Masamune was Megohime (1568‚Äì1653), also known as Lady Tamura, since she was the daughter and only child of Tamura Kiyoaki. Her paternal grandmother and maternal grandmother were also both daughters of Date Tanemune, making her Masamune‚Äôs second cousin. She had four children, the eldest of which (Date Tadamune) was Masamune‚Äôs successor to Sendai Domain. Although Masamune had agreed that their second son should succeed to the Tamura clan, this son (Date Munetsuna) died at the age of 16. In order to restore the Tamura clan, Date Tadamune‚Äôs son Date Muneyoshi was ordered to take the Tamura surname. The restored Tamura clan was given 10,000 koku in Iwagasaki, Kurihara in what is now Miyagi Prefecture. When the young Date Tsunamura became daimy≈ç of Sendai in 1660, Muneyoshi gained an additional 20,000 koku from territories in what is now Ichinoseki, Iwate. In addition, he became a guardian of Date Tsunamura together with Date Munekatsu. In 1662, Muneyoshi was transferred to the newly- created Iwanuma Domain in the Natori District, becoming daimy≈ç of a subsidiary domain to Sendai Domain. In 1695, his son Tamura Tatsuaki, transferred the seat of the domain to Ichinoseki Domain (30,000 koku). The clan remained at Ichinoseki until the Meiji restoration.

Along with Anarosaurus, Dactylosaurus was one of the earliest known pachypleurosaurs to come from Europe.Lepidosauromorpha: Pachypleurosauridae: Dactylosaurus & Anarosaurus Palaeos.com. Last accessed 2008-07-04. Etymology Dactylosaurus comes from the Greek daktulos (Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ), \\"finger\\" and sauros (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ), meaning \\"lizard\\" or \\"reptile.\\" Description The nasal bones of Dactylosaurus meet and are broadly structured.Rieppel, O & L Kebang (1995), \\"Pachypleurosaurs (Reptilia, Sauropterygia) from the Lower Muschelkalk, and a review of the Pachypleurosauroidea.\\" Fieldiana Geol. N.S. 32: 1-44. The upper temporal fenestra is large and kidney-shaped. There are 17 cervical vertebrae and the cervical ribs have anterior processes. The maxillae of Dactylosaurus extended broadly up the side of the snout. =D. gracilis= The holotype specimen (MGUWR WR 3871s) of D. gracilis was only a partial skeleton, consisting of the anterior end alone. Because it differed slightly from the fossils of D. gracilis, it was first thought to belong to the species D. schroederi, which is now considered a junior synonym for juvenile D. gracilis. Once this was established, the juvenile fossil, which was found before the adult fossils, became the holotype. The one limb that was found (a left forelimb), was noted to have a slimmer radius and ulna than Neusticosaurus, a similar nothosaur from Europe. D. gracilis is the smallest known species in its family, which includes the much more recognized Keichousaurus, a nothosaur often remembered for its small size. The original holotype of D. gracilis is considered a juvenile, however the size of a nothosaur when its bones harden is used to show size, making the estimate as smallest member of its family still valid. Distribution Muschelkalk, a German form of shelly limestone, occasionally produces Dactylosaurus fossils in its lowest layers. Dactylosaurus lived in the Early and Middle Triassic period during the Late Olenekian and Anisian faunal stage, of central Europe. In terms of geology, they are found: 1) in the uppermost R√∂t (uppermost Buntsandstein; Lower Triassic): e.g. Micha≈Çkowice (Siemianowice ≈ölƒÖskie) and Kamie≈Ñ ≈ölƒÖski, S Poland, (the second location is not sure because R√∂t is not exposed there), 2) in the lowermost Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic), inter alia in the Gogolin Formation - Gogolin and its vicinity, S Poland.Sues H-D., Carroll R.L. 1985.

His music engravings included a collection by John Frederick Lampe with a setting of the Entered Apprentice's Song.Entered Apprentice's Song In 1728/9, he published a copy of the Old Charges with speeches by two Freemasons, Francis Drake and architect Edward Oakley. His illustrations appeared in books ranging from fables for children to manuals of military drill, a notable work being a venture in collaboration with Edward Oakley, The Magazine of Architecture, Perspective, and Sculpture which provided an introduction to Palladian architecture. Cole made a wide range of instruments that are to be seen in museums throughout Britain. He was apprenticed to Thomas Wright and was free in the Merchant Taylors' Company. The firm of Wright & Cole operated until 1748 when Cole succeeded Wright. Cole & Son conducted their business between 1751 and 1766 from the Orrery adjoining the Globe Tavern, in Fleet Street, London. This address became 136 Fleet Street about 1760 and 200 Fleet Street in later years. The business was taken over by John Troughton in 1782, surviving as Cooke, Troughton & Sims in the twentieth century. Map of City of Westminster 1755 by Benjamin Cole Family Cole started a dynasty of engravers to the Freemasons. His son Benjamin (1725-1813), was apprenticed to his father in 1739. Another son, William, worked as engraver to the Bank of England, and took over control and production of the freemasons' engraved lists in 1767.

The album was mainly composed of sound effects that had been collected by the sound effects department of Walt Disney Studios. The album was released in several different forms. The album was first released in 1964 in a white sleeve, with a second release in 1973 with an orange sleeve. In both versions, the first side contained 10 stories narrated by Laura Olsher, complete with sound effects. The second side contained 10 sound effects meant for others to create their own stories. Despite the title, most of the cuts had nothing to do with haunted houses or witches or ghostly spirits. Featured were such situations as an ocean liner hitting rocks, an idiotic lumberjack, a man crossing an unsafe bridge, someone lighting a stick of dynamite and a spaceship landing on Mars. Also, there are tracks with several examples of cats, dogs and birds (similar to \\"The Birds\\") becoming enraged for some reason, as well as a skit about Chinese water torture. In addition, some of the screams were taken directly from the scene where Miss Havisham catches fire in the 1946 David Lean film Great Expectations. History There was also a British release in 1974 which contained a completely redesigned cover. In 1979, Disney released a follow-up album called New Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House with 33 tracks; however, it featured no haunted mansion specific content, and with many completely different effects (mainly from other sources, including some heard on the Looney Tunes cartoons). Edited portions of this later album were included on a CD called Halloween Songs & Sounds. On December 7, 1972, the album became a certified gold record by the RIAA. On April 11, 1988, the 1979 follow-up edition of the album was certified gold by the RIAA.http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum- searchable-database Art The covers of the American albums featured an image painted with acrylics by Paul Wenzel, which he created as concept art for the attraction The Haunted Mansion. The original was 37\\" x 39\\" and was purchased at auction in 2001 for US$3,000. The cover of the British release featured an actual photo of the ride, while the 1979 album simply displayed a colored image of a haunted house, ravens and a skeleton in a coffin. Samples and cover versions Some of the stories on the album are better known for being sampled in rap songs such as N.W.A's \\"Quiet on Tha Set,\\" Ice Cube's \\"Look Who's Burnin'\\" and \\"Jackin' for Beats\\", and Jedi Mind Tricks' \\"Chinese Water Torture\\". In 1997, Xero, precursor to the rock band Linkin Park, sampled \\"The Very Long Fuse\\" on their demo tape.

Biography He was born on January 30, 1837 in New York City. He married Amanda Elizabeth Crowell in 1859, and they had one son, James Murray Seymour. After the death of his first wife, he married her sister Anna J. Crowell, and the couple also had one son, David C. Seymour. At the age of two, in 1839, Seymour's father died in a yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans. His mother remarried Jose Vantana, and the family went to reside in Spain. Seymour attended St. Austin's College in C√°diz. At the age of 17 he began an apprenticeship at Novelty Iron Works of New York and was subsequently employed by the Erie Railroad. When he was 21, in 1858, he was appointed master mechanic of a railroad from Matanzas to Puerto Pr√≠ncipe in Cuba, and later worked for two years as chief engineer of a large Cuban sugar plantation. In 1865 he joined with Daniel Whitlock to form the engineering firm of Seymour and Whitlock in Newark, New Jersey. In 1884 he was elected to the Newark Aqueduct Board, re-elected in 1887. In 1888 President Grover Cleveland appointed him as one of the United States Commissioners to Spain. In 1891 Governor Leon Abbett named him the State Supervisor of Prisons. Seymour was a candidate for Mayor of Newark in 1894 but lost by nearly 5,000 votes. He ran for mayor again in 1896 and won by a margin of 3,396 votes. He was re-elected as mayor in 1898 and 1900. While he was mayor construction began on a new city hall in Newark. Seymour argued for the creation of \\"Greater Newark\\" by the annexation of a number of nearby towns: East Orange, Vailsburg, Harrison, Kearney, and Belleville. Of these, only Vailsburg was eventually annexed to Newark. In 1901 he was the Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey, opposing the Republican Franklin Murphy. He lost the election by a vote of 183,814 to 166,681. Seymour died in 1905 at his Newark, New Jersey home at the age of 68.

These include articles on a specific general, campaign or more abstract phenomenon such as sieges. Each issue usually starts off with a historical introduction to the theme. The introduction is usually followed by an article that delves into relevant sources for the theme, such as a historical narrative or an archaeological source. The theme is then fleshed out by articles on warriors, battles and generals that fit that issue's theme. Among the authors are well- known specialists like Bob Bennett, Duncan B. Campbell, Ross Cowan, Lukas de Blois, Stephen English, Adrian Murdoch, Joseph Pietrykowski, Jona Lendering, and Mike Roberts. The magazine also includes news and letters from readers, as well as reviews of relevant books, games, models, and museums. The illustrations include original artwork, maps and photographs of artifacts. Online free features of the magazine include the editor's blog and a podcast which is published to coincide with the magazine themes. Other spin-offs were specials on the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and the nature of the Roman centuria. Since 2012, the yearly special is published in the form of a hardcover book. The first was Edge of Empire (2012), a reworked English translation of an originally Dutch book by Jona Lendering and Arjan Bosman on the Roman occupation of the Low Countries.

The abbey was very wealthy in its heyday and ran a prestigious school, but declined during the 15th century, and as early as 1519 was in the control of a lay administrator, the first monastery in Norway to be secularised. With the Reformation the Crown granted it to a tenant in 1532, with a condition that the remaining canons had to be maintained. The buildings fell into disrepair, and in 1610 were used as a quarry for stone for the construction of B√•hus Fortress. Site Dragsmark Abbey ruins: chapter house The monastery ruins are on the west of Boken√§set on the fjord between Uddevalla and the sea, north of the island of Orust. In 1897-98 the ruins were investigated. The church measured about 20 metres by 10 metres, with the conventual buildings to the south, but only two chambers nearest the church have been explored, probably the sacristy and the chapter house. There are traces of other buildings further to the south, and to the west the remains of another building, the relation of which to the rest of the site is not clear.

He previously served as executive of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of General Services, and mayor of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Cunningham is credited with leading an economic renaissance in Bethlehem, rejuvenating the city's two downtowns and helping kick-start Bethlehem's economy after the collapse of Bethlehem Steel. As Lehigh County executive, Cunningham restructured county operations to make economic growth and community regionalization the focus of his administration. Early life and career Don Cunningham Jr. was born on December 13, 1965, to parents Don Sr. and Valerie Cunningham. His family had lived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for five generations, and his father and grandfather were both steel workers at Bethlehem Steel. He graduated from the Freedom High School in 1983. During his time at Freedom he played football, ran track, worked on the student newspaper, and was the front man for a teenage rock band. Cunningham was inducted into the School's hall of fame in 2001. Cunningham went to Shippensburg University and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and a minor in government in 1987. He completed a Master of Arts Degree in political science from Villanova University in 1991. Cunningham worked as a correspondent with The Philadelphia Inquirer and as a reporter with the Globe- Times of Bethlehem from 1988 to 1992, covering city government. He then worked as a spokesman for Moravian College from 1992 to 1993 and as an information specialist at the PPL Corporation in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Political career In 1995, Cunningham was elected to Bethlehem City Council along with two other political newcomers, Democrats Robert Donchez and James Gregory, defeating two veteran councilmen in what The Morning Call newspaper called \\"a new era for City Democrats\\". He served as chairman of the council's Parks and Public Property Committee. In January 1997, during his first council term, Cunningham announced his intention to run for mayor, a post held since 1988 by Ken Smith. Donchez served as his campaign chairman. His candidacy was supported by U.S. Rep Paul McHale and Pennsylvania Rep. T. J. Rooney. Cunningham defeated Marakovits in the Democratic primary by a vote count of 3,384 to 2,916, and went on to face Republican Councilman Otto Ehrsam in the general election. Ehrsham was a 67-year-old Bethlehem Steel retiree who had been on council for 20 years. He was elected with 62 percent of the vote, collecting 6,336 to Ehrsam's 3,919 votes. The Morning Call called it \\"one of the most decisive victories in a Bethlehem mayoral race\\". Voter turnout was approximately 50 percent. At age 31, Cunningham became the youngest elected mayor in the city's history. Cunningham was re-elected to a second term in 2001.Don Cunningham for Lehigh County Executive Cunningham was inaugurated not long after the city's largest employer, Bethlehem Steel, had closed, resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs and a significant portion the city's tax base. During his tenure, Cunningham guided more than $1 billion of new development and the creation of 2,500 new jobs into the city. As mayor, Cunningham proposed five city budgets, only one of which had a tax increase in his final year in the office. Cunningham advocated public-private partnerships and developed new programs to improve public safety and the delivery of neighborhood services. =Secretary of General Services= Cunningham became a short-list candidate for the cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell. Initial discussions centered around the secretary position for the Department of Community and Economic Development. Cunningham said he had modeled his administration's economic development plan in part after the prototype Rendell used as mayor of Philadelphia. In January 2003, it was announced Rendell had tapped Cunningham for the Department of General Services. Cunningham oversaw $4 billion of Pennsylvania's budget, including his department's own budget of $141.6 million. Within his first month in the post, Rendell tasked him with reducing that budget by 10 percent. Cunningham oversaw the design and construction of the non-highway capital construction projects in Pennsylvania, as well as the state's minority and women-owned business contracting program and the Bureau of Commonwealth Media Services. In addition to his secretary position, Cunningham served on the State Public School Building Authority, the Pennsylvania Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the Governor's Homeland Security Advisory Council, the PENNVEST board, the Capitol Preservation Committee, and the Agricultural Land Preservation Interagency Committee during his time in Rendell's administration. =Lehigh Valley positions= Starting in early 2005, Cunningham was courted by Lehigh Valley Democrats to run for executive of Lehigh County. No Democrat had won the executive's office since the county's home rule charter went into effect in 1978, and Lehigh County Democratic Committee Chairman Charles F. Smith Jr. called Cunningham the party's \\"dream candidate\\". Cunningham announced his candidacy for the position in March, and formally resigned from the Rendell administration on April 8. He ran with no opposition in the Democratic primary, clearing the way for a challenge against Republican Executive Jane R. Ervin, who was seeking a second four-year term. During his campaign, Cunningham criticized Ervin for a 69 percent county tax increase in 2003, calling it \\"unconscionable\\" and declaring that a change in leadership was necessary. Ervin responded aggressively to Cunningham's campaign, raising questions about his record in Bethlehem and Rendell's administration and defending her tax increase as the right thing to do for the county. Cunningham defeated Ervin by 33,263 to 20,721, with 62 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat ever elected to the executive post. He had spent roughly $500,000 in the election. Several major development projects and corporate relocations came to fruition during Cunningham's tenure, including the Boston Beer Company establishing their largest brewery in Upper Macungie Township, Olympus Corporation opening its headquarters in Upper Saucon Township; Ocean Spray establishing manufacturing operation in Upper Macungie Township; and Coca-Cola Park, the baseball stadium for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, opening in Allentown. Cunningham also funded open space preservation, negotiated contracts to stem rising health care costs, and helped municipalities with higher crime rates hire more police officers. In 2007, Cunningham endorsed Hillary Clinton in her campaign for U.S. President. In April 2008, Cunningham was the top vote-getter in the 15th congressional district to serve as a delegate Hillary Clinton to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Cunningham announced as early as 2007 that he was considering a run for Pennsylvania governor in 2010. However, in June 2009, he announced he would not seek the post due to family concerns and time restraint. Cunningham had raised about $725,000 for the possible campaign by that point. In 2009, Cunningham was challenged in his re-election campaign by Scott Ott, a Republican political newcomer associated with the conservative Tea Party movement. Ott accused Cunningham of avoiding a county tax increase only by depleting a tax relief fund established during Jane Ervin's administration, leaving the county in a position where future tax hikes would be necessary. Cunningham accused Ott of using scare tactics in his campaign and said he lacked the experience to lead the county. He also argued Republican county commissioners had actually increased spending. Cunningham defeated Ott in the general election by a voter count of 21,063 to 20,201, capturing 51 percent of the vote to Ott's 49 percent. In 2010, a 16.1 percent tax increase was proposed as part of the county budget, with Cunningham said was necessary due to difficult financial times, but would avoid the need to sell assets, deplete savings, impose massive layoffs, or reduce government services to the point that the problem would grow worse in subsequent years. It was the first county tax increase since 2003. The budget was ultimately passed. In 2011, Ott was elected to the county's board of commissioners, along with a slate of fellow conservatives who ran together on a ticket of reform, which heavily criticized the 16 percent county tax increase during their campaigns. Although the board had always been Republican-majority during Cunningham's tenure, he had a particularly difficult relationship with the commissioners after the 2011 election. Cunningham unsuccessfully attempted to veto a county-wide reassessment that commissioners approved, arguing it should have been delayed at least a year to allow time for the market to become less volatile. In May 2012, Cunningham accepted the position of president and CEO of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Council, resigning as Lehigh County executive with a year-and-a-half remaining in his second term.

The objectives of the society are: * to generate and maintain interest and understanding for the history of the railways within the framework of overall history, * to foster scientific studies in this area, * to preserve and maintain important cultural and technological monuments.  History  The society was founded on 22 April 1967 in Karlsruhe and was entered on the official register of clubs and societies there. Members of the society were able to gradually restore the Bochum-Dahlhausen locomotive shed and its surroundings to their former condition after their closure by the Deutsche Bundesbahn on 1 August 1969. Because the arrival of railway vehicles was imminent in 1972 and Dahlhausen was still not totally ready, the locomotive shed next to the workshop building of the old Neustadt/Haardt locomotive shed was rented. In 1981 then, the \\"DGEG Railway Museum of Neustadt/Weinstra√üe\\" emerged. Today the W√ºrzburg Railway Museum is also operated by DGEG.  Collections  The society owns by far the largest and most valuable collection of railway vehicles and equipment in Germany. These include: Railway Museum Bochum-Dahlhausen Neustadt Railway Museum * The Bochum Dahlhausen Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum Bochum- Dahlhausen). * The Neustadt/Weinstra√üe Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum Neustadt/Weinstra√üe), that is located in the immediate vicinity of the main station at Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, in its former locomotive shed. The DGEG operates the Little Cuckoo Railway (Kuckucksb√§hnel) from there, using its own rolling stock. * The DGEG's W√ºrzburg Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum W√ºrzburg) organises public services and, on request, special services in the W√ºrzburg area with the DRG Class 52 goods train steam locomotive, no. 52 7409, which was built in 1943. The DGEG also owns a large library (in cooperation with the University Library of Dortmund (Universit√§tsbibliothek Dortmund) whose books can be loaned through any public library in Germany, and an archive on the subject of railways in Witten. The collection of narrow gauge vehicles was dissolved and museum operations on the Jagsttal line (Jagsttalbahn) had to be given up on the closure of the route.  Organisation  The DGEG has around 2,000 members at present, that in several regions and towns have also formed membership groups. The office is located in Werl. The museums in Bochum, Neustadt und W√ºrzburg are legally dependent profit centres within the society, the museum in Bochum is still a limited company.

In other words, the graph is revealed while it is being explored, and explorative edges are charged even if they do not contribute to the final path. This optimization problem was introduced by Christos Papadimitriou and Mihalis Yannakakis in 1989 and a number of variants of the problem have been studied since. The name supposedly originates from conversations of the authors who learned of a difficulty Canadian drivers had: traveling a network of cities with snowfall randomly blocking roads. The stochastic version, where each edge is associated with a probability of independently being in the graph, has been given considerable attention in operations research under the name \\"the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse\\" (SSPPR).  Problem description  For a given instance, there are a number of possibilities, or realizations, of how the hidden graph may look. Given an instance, a description of how to follow the instance in the best way is called a policy. The CTP task is to compute the expected cost of the optimal policies. To compute an actual description of an optimal policy may be a harder problem. Given an instance and policy for the instance, every realization produces its own (deterministic) walk in the graph. Note that the walk is not necessarily a path since the best strategy may be to, e.g., visit every vertex of a cycle and return to the start. This differs from the shortest path problem (with strictly positive weights), where repetitions in a walk implies that a better solution exists.  Variants  There are primarily five parameters distinguishing the number of variants of the Canadian Traveller Problem. The first parameter is how to value the walk produced by a policy for a given instance and realization. In the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse, the goal is simply to minimize the cost of the walk (defined as the sum over all edges of the cost of the edge times the number of times that edge was taken). For the Canadian Traveller Problem, the task is to minimize the competitive ratio of the walk; i.e., to minimize the number of times longer the produced walk is to the shortest path in the realization. The second parameter is how to evaluate a policy with respect to different realizations consistent with the instance under consideration. In the Canadian Traveller Problem, one wishes to study the worst case and in SSPPR, the average case. For average case analysis, one must furthermore specify an a priori distribution over the realizations. The third parameter is restricted to the stochastic versions and is about what assumptions we can make about the distribution of the realizations and how the distribution is represented in the input. In the Stochastic Canadian Traveller Problem and in the Edge- independent Stochastic Shortest Path Problem (i-SSPPR), each uncertain edge (or cost) has an associated probability of being in the realization and the event that an edge is in the graph is independent of which other edges are in the realization. Even though this is a considerable simplification, the problem is still #P-hard. Another variant is to make no assumption on the distribution but require that each realization with non-zero probability be explicitly stated (such as ‚ÄúProbability 0.1 of edge set { {3,4},{1,2} }, probability 0.2 of...‚Äù). This is called the Distribution Stochastic Shortest Path Problem (d-SSPPR or R-SSPPR) and is NP-complete. The first variant is harder than the second because the former can represent in logarithmic space some distributions that the latter represents in linear space. The fourth and final parameter is how the graph changes over time. In CTP and SSPPR, the realization is fixed but not known. In the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse and Resets or the Expected Shortest Path problem, a new realization is chosen from the distribution after each step taken by the policy. This problem can be solved in polynomial time by reducing it to a Markov decision process with polynomial horizon. The Markov generalization, where the realization of the graph may influence the next realization, is known to be much harder. An additional parameter is how new knowledge is being discovered on the realization. In traditional variants of CTP, the agent uncovers the exact weight (or status) of an edge upon reaching an adjacent vertex. A new variant was recently suggested where an agent also has the ability to perform remote sensing from any location on the realization. In this variant, the task is to minimize the travel cost plus the cost of sensing operations. Formal definition We define the variant studied in the paper from 1989. That is, the goal is to minimize the competitive ratio in the worst case. It is necessary that we begin by introducing certain terms. Consider a given graph and the family of undirected graphs that can be constructed by adding one or more edges from a given set. Formally, let \\\\mathcal{G}(V,E,F) = \\\\\\\\{(V,E+F')  F' \\\\subseteq F\\\\\\\\}, E \\\\cap F = \\\\emptyset where we think of E as the edges that must be in the graph and of F as the edges that may be in the graph. We say that G \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}(V,E,F) is a realization of the graph family. Furthermore, let W be an associated cost matrix where w_{ij} is the cost of going from vertex i to vertex j, assuming that this edge is in the realization. For any vertex v in V, we call E_B(v,V) its incident edges with respect to the edge set B on V. Furthermore, for a realization G \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}(V,E,F), let d_B(s,t) be the cost of the shortest path in the graph from s to t. This is called the off-line problem because an algorithm for such a problem would have complete information of the graph. We say that a strategy \\\\pi to navigate such a graph is a mapping from (\\\\mathcal{P}(E),\\\\mathcal{P}(F),V) to V, where \\\\mathcal{P}(X) denotes the powerset of X. We define the cost c(\\\\pi, B) of a strategy \\\\pi with respect to a particular realization G = (V,B) as follows. * Let v_0 = s, E_0 = E and F_0 = F. * For i = 0, 1, 2, ..., define ** E_{i+1} = E_i \\\\cup E_B(v_i,V), ** F_{i+1} = F_i - E_F(v_i,V), and ** v_{i+1} = \\\\pi(E_{i+1}, F_{i+1}, v_i). * If there exists a T such that v_T = t, then c(\\\\pi, B) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} w_{v_i,v_{i+1}}; otherwise let c(\\\\pi, B) = \\\\infty. In other words, we evaluate the policy based on the edges we currently know are in the graph (E_i) and the edges we know might be in the graph (F_i). When we take a step in the graph, the edges incident to our new location become known to us. Those edges that are in the graph are added to E_i, and regardless of whether the edges are in the graph or not, they are removed from the set of unknown edges, F_i. If the goal is never reached, we say that we have an infinite cost. If the goal is reached, we define the cost of the walk as the sum of the costs of all of the edges traversed, with cardinality. Finally, we define the Canadian traveller problem. : Given a CTP instance (V,E,F,s,t,r), decide whether there exists a policy \\\\pi such that for every realization (V,B) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}(V,E,F), the cost c(\\\\pi, B) of the policy is no more than r times the off-line optimal, d_B(s, t). Papadimitriou and Yannakakis noted that this defines a two-player game, where the players compete over the cost of their respective paths and the edge set is chosen by the second player (nature). Complexity The original paper analysed the complexity of the problem and reported it to be PSPACE-complete. It was also shown that finding an optimal path in the case where each edge has an associated probability of being in the graph (i-SSPPR) is a PSPACE-easy but ‚ôØP-hard problem.Papadimitriou and Yannakakis, 1989, p. 148 It was an open problem to bridge this gap, but since then both the directed and undirected versions were shown to be PSPACE-hard.Fried, Shimony, Benbassat, and Wenner 2013 The directed version of the stochastic problem is known in operations research as the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse. Applications The problem is said to have applications in operations research, transportation planning, artificial intelligence, machine learning, communication networks, and routing. A variant of the problem has been studied for robot navigation with probabilistic landmark recognition. Open problems Despite the age of the problem and its many potential applications, many natural questions still remain open. Is there a constant- factor approximation or is the problem APX-hard? Is i-SSPPR #P-complete? An even more fundamental question has been left unanswered: is there a polynomial-size description of an optimal policy, setting aside for a moment the time necessary to compute the description?Karger and Nikolova, 2008, p. 1 See also * Graph traversal * Hitting time * Shortest path problem Notes References  * Category:PSPACE-complete problems Category:Travelling salesman problem Category:Computational problems in graph theory ","title":"Canadian traveller problem"},{"id":"18210395","text":"HD 124639 is a Be star in the southern constellation of Apus.

Participating are the six states belonging to New England: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as well as the Eastern Canadian provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec. In addition, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) is building a Regional Greenhouse Gas Registry (RGGR) to help track emissions in the region.

Ironically, the case received help from drug dealers, who testified that the two officers were involved in the use of robbery, extortion, and excessive force against various dealers as a means of reselling the drugs for profit on the street.

The bay at Saunalahti is named Bastvikfj√§rden. The area also contains original detached house residence from old Saunalahti and agriculture. Saunalahti is separated from Kivenlahti by the L√§nsiv√§yl√§ highway, continuing to Kirkkonummi as Jorvaksentie. The Bastvik manor, dating back to the 19th century, has long since fallen into disrepair. In 2005, the city has started renovating it, and it is planned to host the office of the renovation project architects (Arkkitehtitoimisto Okulus Oy), a caf√©, and a home. The Bastvik projekt includes research of old construction and manufacturing techniques. At some point, Bastvik was planned as a remote facility of the apartment fair held in Kauklahti in summer 2006. However, the plan was abandoned. The Bastvik manor had a significant sawmill in the 19th century, and because of this, S√•gholmen (formerly an island, currently the Sahaniemi peninsula) has been a stopping place for large ships. In the late 1910s, the manor building suffered from lack of management, but in 1923 the farm was bought by Claes Nordstedt, the founder of the Kauklahti glass works, who renovated the building. When the Kauklahti glass works went into bankruptcy, Nordstedt sold the farm to banker Antti Hiltunen and his family in 1928. Hiltunen had the manor building renovated again, this time also architecturally. By the plans of architect V√§in√∂ Toivio, the building got a neo-classical, villa-style look. The current 2000s renovation project of the manor building aims to preserve this 1920s spirit. The Espoo rantaraitti route is planned to extend all the way to Saunalahti. At this moment, the coast of Saunalahti is, except for a few small exceptions, not accessible to the public. Saunalahti being built in November 2004. Construction The houses in Saunalahti are built to preserve the original nature as much as possible. The houses are built at different heights, so that most have a view to the Gulf of Finland. All houses fit in with each other despite not looking exactly alike. Saunalahti will be the home of 5000 new inhabitants. The first of these moved into the area in autumn 2003. The new district will mostly be finished in 2010. Services Saunalahti School was opened in 2012. It began in 2008, when 13 architects at Verstas started designing the school. Construction commenced in 2010 and was completed in 2012. The building also houses the Saunalahti library.

Ten years later, the two men would again vie for the same position, this time, Mayor of Newark. In this race, however, Haussling was victorious over the two-term mayor Doremus, in large part due to his strong stance against the unpopular \\"Bishop's Law\\", which prohibited the operation of saloons on Sundays. Haussling was re-elected in 1908, 1910, and 1912, until being defeated by Thomas Lynch Raymond in 1914.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the eastern black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) from H√≤a B√¨nh and Cao B·∫±ng provinces of Vietnam and Jingxi County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Molecular data, together with morphology and call differences, suggest it is a separate species. Its habitat consists of broad-leaved forests and semi-deciduous monsoon forests. It feeds on ripe, sugar-rich fruit, such as figs (Ficus spp.) and, at times, leaves, and insects.  Current status  Hainan black-crested gibbons are under grave threat of extinction. They are currently identified as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature‚Äôs Red List. Historically, they were widespread in China: Government records dating back to the 17th century state that their range used to cover half of China, although the records in question might represent multiple species, as some are from areas separated from each other by physical barriers such as large rivers that gibbons would have difficulty crossing. The gibbon population on Hainan Island has decreased precipitously over the last half century. While in the 1950s, more than 2,000 gibbons were found over the entirety of Hainan Island, a study in 2003 found 13 total gibbons split into two groups and two lone males, and in 2004 only 12-19 Hainan gibbons were found exclusively in the Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve. The most recent count found 22 Hainan gibbons split between two families, one of 11 and one of seven members, with four loners, all residing in Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan Island. Habitat loss is the primary cause in the decline of the Hainan gibbon; poaching has also been a problem. Over 25% of the Hainan gibbon‚Äôs habitat has been reduced due to illegal pulp paper plantation growers. Originally denizens of lowland forest, logging has driven them to less suitable habitat at higher altitudes. The species is currently vulnerable to being eliminated by a single major storm or epidemic.  Physical and breeding characteristics  Sexual dichromatism is distinct in the Hainan gibbon. The males are all almost completely black, with sometimes white or buff cheeks. Females, conversely, are a golden or buff color with black patches, including a streak of black on the head. Both males and females are slender, with long arms and legs and no tail. The arms are used to swing from tree to tree, which is known as brachiation. The Hainan gibbon sings duets for bonding and mating. The Hainan gibbons have acquired some reproductive adaptations in response to their drastically decreased natural habitat. The few remaining gibbons exhibit polygynous relationships; small families typically consist of one breeding male, two mature females, and their offspring. This stable pair bond relationship seems to have allowed the gibbons to decrease their interbirth interval, the length of time between births. Their two-year interbirth interval is shorter than that of most gibbon species and coincides with the blooming patterns of fruits on the Hainan Islands. The Hainan gibbon also has a shorter gestation period than other gibbon species. It has been observed that not all sexually mature females in the wild are breeding, however, the reasons for this are unclear. Habitat selection The Hainan gibbons reside in three different types of forests on the island. Their main area of occupancy is known as the primary forest (Old-growth forest). Within the primary forest the gibbons typically live in trees that are ten meters or taller. Along with offering sources of shelter and trees for singing rituals, the primary forests are also home to at least six species of plants eaten by the gibbons. When primary forests are destroyed, it takes the trees an extensive amount of time to regenerate to a state that is suitable as a home for the gibbons. In the 1960s, much of Hainan's lowlands were deforested to make way for rubber plantations and commercial logging, causing a dramatic decline in their population. These actions forced gibbon communities to higher elevations. By 1999, only 4% of the gibbons‚Äô original habitat remained on the island. Aside from primary forest, the gibbons split their time between two areas known as secondary forests and dwarf forests. The secondary forests are less suitable for the Hainan gibbons than the primary forests. Their trees are shorter in height, and they severely lack resources, such as food and shelter, needed by the gibbons to survive. The dwarf forest is even less favorable for the gibbons and a study by Fan et al. found that gibbons spent only 0.5% of the thirteen-month study period in dwarf forests. Nonetheless, the dwarf forests still account for a small portion of their habitat and are used by gibbons to move between primary forests. Even with the secondary and dwarf forests for the gibbons to reside in, the destruction of primary forests still severely impacts the gibbon population in a negative manner. Resource availability, predation, and human expansion A major result of habitat loss is the reduction of resources available to the Hainan gibbons. While lowland tropical forests are the most suitable habitat for the Hainan gibbon, much of this habitat and approximately 95% of the original vegetation on Hainan Island has been destroyed due to deforestation. This natural vegetation has been succeeded by pine and fir trees, which decrease the amount of food available for the gibbons. Zhou et al. observed two unsuccessful hawk attacks on young gibbons, however, humans are the main threat to the Hainan gibbon. The human population on Hainan exploded 330% between 1950 and 2003, much of which was due to the open door policy implemented by the Chinese government in the late 1980s. Naturally, the population boom led to the construction of roads and towns to accompany the developing rubber and timber industry. Many of these projects led not only to the destruction of habitat where the gibbons were found, but also caused gibbon populations to split and become isolated from other groups of gibbons. In addition to the economic development brought by the growing population, there is financial pressure to capture gibbons, since a female gibbon can be worth up to 300 US dollars. Gibbon bones are prized in traditional medicine and this belief led to many mass hunts between 1960 and 1980, leading to the death of approximately 100 gibbons. Aside from direct interactions between humans and gibbons, the low income of most residents of Hainan has led to their reliance on the forests for firewood, food, and herbs for use in traditional medicine, further amplifying human impact on the environment. Ecological significance The Hainan gibbon is considered an umbrella species for the Hainan Island. This designation indicates that status of the Hainan gibbon is a marker for the health and stability of its ecosystem. Alterations in the characteristics of the Hainan ecosystem that negatively affect the gibbons are indicative of negative impact on other species as well. Other species of gibbons have been shown to be important factors in seed dispersal of several plant species, most notably figs and other fruit bearing plants. Therefore, the destruction of the natural vegetation on Hainan Island, coupled with the dwindling gibbon population bodes ill for the recovery of native plant species. This being said, no gibbon species has gone extinct in the modern world and no other primate has gone extinct since the 1700s, so there is little research on their ecological importance or methods of conservation. The impact that the extinction of the Hainan gibbon could have is not well characterized due to the limited amount of research. Conservation =Reproduction limitations= The breeding characteristics for the Hainan gibbon do not lend themselves to rapid population growth. The breeding females have a single offspring every two years and the newborn has a dependence period of roughly a year and a half. Furthermore, there are currently no Hainan gibbons in captivity and all previous attempts to breed them in captivity have failed. =Conservation action plan= In response to the declining population of Hainan gibbons, a collaborative status survey and conservation plan was published in 2003 and updated in 2005. The survey was backed by members of the Hainanese and mainland Chinese governments, Kadoorie Conservation China, Fauna and Flora International (FFI), and other international institutions. The goals of the survey were to investigate the current status of the Hainan gibbon to better understand its situation and make recommendations. With the initial survey results, the 2005 update focused on reparative action. The recommendations for action focused on several factors, the first being the mitigation of habitat loss by increasing and better equipping patrols of the island to dissuade illegal loggers. Other suggestions included reverting lowland plantations and farms back into habitable forests for gibbons by specifically planting plant species they require for survival, such as figs and myrtle. The plan also called for educating the residents of the island on the importance of the Hainan gibbon. The loss of habitat directly impacts both sources of food and shelter the gibbons need to survive. Greenpeace and FFI conservation groups have been involved in raising public awareness both locally in East Asia and abroad. Currently the Action Plan is underfunded and poorly supported by its participating members, with limited coordination between them. Greenpeace has been calling on Hainan to better enforce its laws on poaching and logging.

ANAD assists people struggling with eating disorders such as Anorexia nervosa and Bulimia nervosa and also provides resources for families, schools and the eating disorder community. Headquartered in Naperville, Illinois, ANAD is a non-profit organization working in the areas of support, awareness, advocacy, referral, education, and prevention. ANAD runs a 9-5 helpline and help email. Activities have included successfully campaigning against pro- anorexia websites. ANAD distributes its quarterly newsletter, Working Together, to members, volunteers, clinicians, and provides an electronic copy on its website, www.anad.org, at no cost to the public. ANAD's partners include Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital, Linden Oaks Hospital, McCallum Place, Rader Programs, Rogers Memorial Hospital, and Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center. ANAD is a philanthropy of Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority. History In the early 1970s, Vivian Hanson Meehan, ANAD's president and founder, was a nurse at a hospital in Highland Park, Illinois. When a family member was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa, Vivian was unable to find any information or resources on eating disorders. Support was unavailable. She was told by experts, \\"Anorexia Nervosa is so rare that there are probably no more than 2000 cases of Anorexia Nervosa in the United States - you are wasting your time.\\" Meehan decided to do something simple to see if the experts were right: she placed a small classified ad in a local newspaper looking for others who were searching for information about Anorexia Nervosa. Within days the ad generated eight responses from those struggling with eating disorders and family members in her community. A national magazine picked up on the story and Meehan was deluged by thousands of phone calls and letters. She opened up her home and her heart and launched the first helpline and referral service in the nation for Anorexia Nervosa and associated eating disorders. The small support group Meehan founded in her home went on to establish groups across the nation. These groups continue to provide peer-to- peer support and self-help for the individuals and families affected by eating disorders and are available at no cost. Meehan was born in Sanish, North Dakota, in 1925. She became a Registered Nurse (RN) after graduation from the University of Minnesota School of Nursing. She was a supervisor of nurses and later director of the Department of Eating Disorders at Highland Park Hospital in Highland Park, Illinois. Programs =Live help= Since its inception, ANAD has provided an open helpline, (630) 577-1330 from 9am - 5pm, central time. A help email is available and may be found on ANAD's website. Those who answer the phones and email offer support, encouragement and resources including referral to support groups, therapists and treatment centers.

Judge George Chiweshe, the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, said that it was taking longer to count the ballots than it had in the past because there were four separate elections occurring at once (for President, for the House of Assembly, for the Senate, and for local councils). Parliamentary results, but not presidential results, began to be announced by the Electoral Commission on 31 March. The MDC continued to claim victory for Tsvangirai, and there was speculation that the delay in announcing results was being used to facilitate rigging. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged the immediate release of results,Sylvia Manika, Blessing Zulu, and Carole Gombakomba, \\"Nerves On Edge In Harare As Zimbabwe Election Count Enters Day Three\\", VOA News, 31 March 2008. and White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that it was \\"concerned\\" by the delay.\\"US concerns over Zimbabwe election results delay\\", newzimbabwe.com, 31 March 2008.

The Herald reported on the same day that a second round was likely,\\"Zim opposition claim victory\\", AFP (IOL), 2 April 2008. and Biti, saying that \\"state media has already begun to prepare the people for a run-off in 21 days\\", affirmed that the MDC would participate in a second round if it was necessary.

The MDC faction led by Mutambara said that it would back Tsvangirai in a second round, stressing that removing Mugabe from power was its highest priority. Delays in release of results, High Court hearing Speculation in early April included the possibility that the 21-day period between the first and second rounds would be extended to 90 days by a presidential decree. A coalition of groups known as the National Constitutional Assembly criticised the failure of the Electoral Commission to release results up to that point, noting that all results had been posted outside of the polling stations and saying that it considered the Electoral Commission's explanations for the delay to be \\"inadequate\\". The coalition also said that, \\"given the anxiety that is gripping the country\\", it would be \\"unacceptable\\" to delay a second round to 90 days after the first round, expressing concern that this could lead to \\"a serious constitutional and political crisis\\".

Aside from the alleged reduction in the number of Mugabe's votes at the polling stations, Mutasa said that some people, after voting at one polling station, passed their identity cards to others, who would in turn vote at the other four polling stations in a ward (each ward having five polling stations).

The cover photograph is by Allan Jenkins. Anderson is keen to make the live shows of Wilderness symbolise an intimate affair. \\"The live shows will be very minimalist with just myself and a cello player on stage.\\" Speaking on the album‚Äôs much lower media profile compared with his previous work, Anderson said: \\"I have no record company, no publisher and a smaller audience but I have never been more confident and focused about what I am doing as an artist.\\" Release According to Anderson's manager Ian Grenfell, promoting Wilderness was not going to follow the usual \\"rule book\\". He said: \\"Brett knew exactly what record he wanted to make, and we recognized it was unlikely to get radio airplay, so we've put a [marketing] structure around it that makes sense commercially.\\" The album was released on Anderson's own BA Songs label.

Native to Northern and Western Africa, and the Middle East, through introductions it is now also established elsewhere, including parts of the United States, where it has been declared an invasive species and has caused significant environmental damage. It is known as blue kurper in South Africa. Description In their introduced US range, blue tilapia are usually in length, and reach weights up to . The largest recorded specimen was more than long and weighed more than . Blue tilapia are mouthbrooders, and broods range from 160 to 1600 eggs per female. O. aureus is primarily herbivorous, but occasionally consumes zooplankton; the young include small invertebrates in their diet. Range and habitat The blue tilapia is native to Northern and Western Africa, and the Middle East. In Africa, it is native to the Senegal, Niger, Benue and lower Nile Rivers. In the Middle East, it is native to the Jordan River. Through introductions, the fish can be found in the United States in Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Nevada. It has also been established in Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. The original stocks of O. aureus in the United States were from Israel. The blue tilapia is primarily a fresh and brackish water fish that occurs in a wide range of habitats such as streams, rivers, lakes and ponds, but it has a high tolerance for salt water and even hypersaline conditions at up to 4.5% salinity (seawater is about 3.5%). It primarily occurs in waters that range from , but tolerates between . =Israel= The Israeli Oreochromis aureus is known there also as \\"Jordan St. Peter's fish\\" and was traditionally coming down the Jordan River from Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee. It is black and larger than the white \\"Common St. Peter's fish\\" or simply \\"St. Peter's fish\\" (Coptodon zillii, ŸÖÿ¥ÿ∑ musht in Arabic and adopted into Modern Hebrew, lit. \\"comb\\"). Another \\"St. Peter's fish\\" is the \\"Galilee St. Peter's fish\\" (mango tilapia, Sarotherodon galileus; Arabic ŸÖÿ¥ÿ∑ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿäÿ∂ musht 'abyad), which is white and also larger than C. zillii.Aharon Geva-Kleinberger, Autochthonous Texts in the Arabic Dialect of the Jews of Tiberias, Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbanden 2009, volume 046, pp. 67 and 107, Invasive species Oreochromis aureus has been introduced in many places around the world for use as a food fish, and frequently in order to control aquatic vegetation. Its presence may have in many cases been mis- documented as Oreochromis niloticus, because the two species were only recently distinguished. =In the United States= Since its introduction into Florida in 1961, the fish has increased its range and frequency of occurrence. It is now the most widespread foreign species in Florida, with established populations as far north as Lake Alice, in Gainesville. It is a major management problem for the National Park Service due to its predominance in Taylor Slough in Everglades National Park, where it has changed the fish community structure. The species is also expanding its range in Texas. It was at one time responsible for inhibition of the population of largemouth bass in Lake Trinidad (in Henderson County) until it was extirpated, and is implicated in the unionid mussel declines in two bodies of water in Texas. It is also blamed for a severe decline in native fish populations in Warm Springs Natural Area, Nevada.

According to the law, if one candidate in a second round withdraws, the other candidate is automatically the winner. Chinamasa was dismissive of the MDC's claim that it would not participate in a second round, saying that if the party was serious, it should formally withdraw. According to Chinamasa, the MDC wanted to avoid humiliation in a second round, which he predicted ZANU-PF would win by a large margin, and was using the threat to boycott as a \\"face-saving gesture\\".\\"Few options for MDC in poll stalemate\\" , newzimbabwe.com, 14 April 2008. Biti also urged SADC leaders due to meet in Zambia on 12 April to call for Mugabe's resignation, and he said that Tsvangirai would attend the SADC meeting. Matonga, the Deputy Information Minister, said initially that Mugabe would also attend the SADC meeting, although Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said that \\"there is no crisis in Zimbabwe that warrants a special meeting on Zimbabwe\\". Soon afterwards, state radio reported that three ministers would represent Zimbabwe at the summit, rather than Mugabe himself. Matonga said the summit was called without consulting Zimbabwe.Nelson Banya, \\"Mugabe snubs SADC, political rallies banned\\", Reuters (IOL), 11 April 2008. According to Matonga, Mugabe decided not to attend because he could not answer anything; as a candidate, he was unable to say what the results of the election would be or when they would be announced.

The MDC had planned to hold a rally on 13 April. Nelson Chamisa of the MDC said: \\"We cannot accept a declaration of a police state.

Mbeki visited Harare and met with Mugabe on 12 April immediately before going to Lusaka for the SADC meeting on the same day. After he met with Mugabe, Mbeki said that there was not a crisis, emphasising that it was the responsibility of the Electoral Commission to release results and urging patience in waiting for the results.\\"Zimbabwe focus of regional summit\\", Al Jazeera, 12 April 2008. At the summit, Zimbabwe was to be represented by Mnangagwa, Chinamasa, Foreign Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, and Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Joey Bimha.

Sometimes you attend, sometimes you have other things holding you back.\\" Regarding Mbeki's statement that the situation in Zimbabwe was not a crisis, Tsvangirai said that \\"such a misrepresentation creates the perception of quiet approval which I think is quite shocking\\", and he indicated that Mbeki had expressed a different view when the two had met privately. MDC Secretary for International Affairs Elphas Mukonoweshuro was overtly hostile in his reaction to Mbeki's statement, wondering if Mbeki had been drunk at the time.\\"Top MDC official calls Mbeki a 'drunkard'\\" , newzimbabwe.com, 15 April 2008. =After the SADC meeting= Despite the absence of Mugabe, the 13-hour SADC meeting in Lusaka lasted well into the night.

He said that ZANU-PF had made this offer only due to international pressure, that the violence was ongoing (by this point the MDC placed the death toll at 43), as part of a \\"grand plan to rig the elections\\" by attacking MDC supporters and displacing them from their constituencies, and he doubted that ZANU-PF would stop.\\"Zim violence: MDC slams Zanu-PF\\", The Star (IOL), 21 May 2008, page 7.

Born in Thurles, County Tipperary, Callanan first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-four when he first linked up with the Tipperary senior team. He joined the senior panel during the 1918 championship and was a regular member of the Tipperary and Dublin teams at various times for over a decade. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, two Leinster medals and one Munster medal. The All-Ireland-winning captain in 1930, Callanan was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter- provincial Callanan won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a one-time championship medallist with Thurles Sarsfields while he also played with Collegians. Callanan retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1930 championship. Playing career =Club= Callanan began his club hurling career with Thurles Sarsfields before later transferring to Collegians in Dublin. He enjoyed little initial success, with his only major victory coming in the twilight of his career after moving back to Thurles Sarsfields. In 1929 Sarsfields qualified for the championship decider. A 4-3 to 1-3 defeat of Toomevara secured a first title in eighteen years and gave Callanan a Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship medal. =Inter-county= Callanan joined the Tipperary senior team during the 1918 championship. After two unsuccessful years he later transferred to Dublin. In 1920 Callanan was a regular member of the starting fifteen with Dublin and won his first Leinster medal following a 4-5 to 2-2 defeat of Kilkenny. The War of Independence hampered the organisation of the championship with the All- Ireland decider not being played until 14 May 1922. Reigning champions Cork provided the opposition, however, Dublin won with a four-goal blitz from Joe Phelan. The 4-9 to 4-3 victory gave Callanan an All-Ireland medal. Callanan added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1921 as Dublin accounted for Kilkenny by 4-4 to 1-5. On 4 March 1923 Dublin faced Limerick in the All- Ireland final. Four goals by Limerick captain Bob McConkey helped the Shannonsiders to an 8-5 to 3-2 victory as the Liam MacCarthy Cup was presented for the very first time. By 1926 Callanan had rejoined the Tipperary senior team, however, Cork dominated the championship. In 1930 he was captain of the team as Cork's bid for a record-equaling fifth successive provincial title faltered. Tipperary bested Clare in the decider by 6-4 to 2-8, giving Callanan a Munster medal. On 7 September 1930 Tipperary faced Callanan's former side Dublin in the All-Ireland decider. Goals at the end of the first half from Martin Kennedy and Callanan gave Tipperary the edge. An eventual 2-7 to 1-3 victory gave Callanan a second All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. =Inter-provincial= Callanan was chosen for the Munster inter-provincial team in 1928. He won his sole Railway Cup medal that year following Munster's defeat of arch rivals Leinster in the decider.
